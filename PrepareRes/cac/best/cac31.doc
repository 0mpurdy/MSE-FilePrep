GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MATTHEW

CHRISTIANITY
Many in the present day seem to think that Christianity is a development of Judaism, but there could be no greater mistake. Christianity is the introduction of what is wholly new and altogether divine in the Person of the Son of God. We are slow to get hold of this. We do not readily perceive that "the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees" (@Matthew 16: 6), and human sentiment (verses 22, 23) are things of which to beware. But if we savour the things that be of men we are far from the savour of "things that are of God". The leaven of the Pharisees is human religiousness, and the leaven of the Sadducees is human intellect working in connection with divine things. Both are to be dreaded and shunned as elements ever opposed to what is of God, and human sentiment is no better in result, however well it may appear on the surface.
The full revelation of God has come out in Christ the Son. This gives Christ an altogether unrivalled place in the estimation of everyone who has been taught of the Father. Godhead glory shines out in Him before our adoring hearts. I do not refer to this merely as christian doctrine, but as something which has become a very great reality to us. It is our deep joy to know the blessed God revealed in His beloved Son. God has spoken to us in the Son, and He would have us to look at the wonderful record contained in the gospels, in the intelligence of the Holy Spirit, to see the revelation of Himself in it all.
Then whatever came out in the life of Jesus here was uttered in a far deeper way at the cross. What a telling forth of God's heart was there! The death of the Son of God is the mighty voice of divine love to man. The ruin, need, guilt, and
{4}
condemnation of man, the sinner, only serve as the dark background to show in stronger light the love that would reach him and bless him in spite of it all. When all were in utter darkness and ignorance of God, He spoke in that amazing hour of Calvary so that He might be known, and loved, and worshipped by all who have ears to hear.
The revelation of God necessarily carries with it salvation for men. God has spoken to us in the Person of the Son (@Hebrews 1), and the "great salvation" began to be spoken by the Lord (@Hebrews 2). Salvation is man's inheritance according to the grace of God. The portion of men in God's mind is to be "heirs of salvation", and those who despise their birthright are profane persons like Esau, entirely alienated from God. Salvation for men is bound up with the revelation of God because that revelation has come out in the way of redemption. The heart of God was toward man, but certain terrible questions stood in the way. Sins, death and the curse seemed to bar the blessing of men, but the Son has removed them all out of the way. He "having made by himself the purification of sins, set himself down on the right hand of the greatness on high" (@Hebrews 1: 3), and men can now find salvation in the knowledge of God.
Then there is another thing -- the rights of God are all taken up in His beloved Son. There are two things in this connection: the inheritance and the throne. God has established the Son "heir of all things"; He will take up his inheritance in the Person of the Son. Then the throne -- the rule of God -- will also be taken up in the Son, so that God's inheritance may be filled with order and blessing under His rule. The glorious Person who is great enough for all this, and the knowledge of Him by the Father's work in souls, is the Rock on which the assembly is built.
All saints are living stones for Christ's assembly by divine calling. That is what we are in the thought and intention of God. But we have to become living stones characteristically, and the Father's work is essential to this. Peter was a kind of
{5}
pattern man; he confessed the Christ, the Son of the living God, by the Father's revelation; but no doubt he had afterwards to reach what was involved in his confession in the history of his soul. We often get things first as divine light, and then we have to be brought into the spiritual reality of them by the work of God in our souls. These two things must ever be kept in view: what we are by God's calling and what we are by God's work. The first is all that is in God's mind for us; the second is the measure of our experimental entrance upon it. The first is altogether divine and perfect; as to the second the Spirit may be grieved by us and the work of God hindered.
The assembly, as built by Christ, is composed of those who are in the life of Christ by the Spirit and who own no other, and therefore the gates of hades cannot prevail against it. Satan can overthrow everything that is of man, but he cannot prevail against what is of Christ.
The Lord said to Peter, "Thou art Peter, (a stone: note h, @Matthew 16: 18) and on this rock I will build my assembly". There is something in common between a stone and a rock; a stone is a small piece of the same material as a rock. Peter was a bit of the Rock, and that is what saints are. As taught by the Father to appreciate Christ, and to turn from what is not Christ, we, that is true believers, are of kindred nature with Christ. "For both he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren" (@Hebrews 2: 11).
If we look around in the world we see that people generally have little or no concern about Christ; His things are of no interest and are meaningless to them. But there are hearts that thrill with joy in the sense of His blessedness and love. What makes the difference? Just this, that it has been well-pleasing to the Father to reveal something of that blessed One to babes (@Matthew 11: 25). It is infinitely better to be the smallest, feeblest babe and to perceive the greatness and glory and love of Christ than to be the most honoured person
{6}
in the world without any appreciation of Him. It is good when Christ can say to one, "Thou art Peter" -'You are of kindred nature to Myself'! Of course it is necessarily so, if He is our life, and in the Spirit we own no other. The Father has taken us up to bring this about in us. If Christ has thrown self and the world and man in the flesh into the shade in the estimation of our hearts, it is clear proof that we have been the subjects of a divine work. It is as such that we are material for Christ's assembly -- divinely formed material for a divine structure. The Christ, the Son of the living God, is now before us, and the consciousness of belonging to Him and being of Him puts us in spirit outside things here and in moral separation from man in the flesh and his world.

THE WORDS OF OUR LORD
@Luke 2: 29; @Matthew 3: 14, 15; @Matthew 4: 4, 7, 10
I wanted to read a few of the words of our Lord. These scriptures are in my mind as standing in connection with what we have been reminded of lately -- the importance of love to our Lord Jesus Christ.
I think in these five utterances, which, as we know, are the first recorded utterances of our Lord, we get what might be regarded as a full and complete presentation of what He is in Himself -- what He is inwardly. We know that painters have tried to put upon canvas their ideas of the Lord's outward appearance, but none of us trust their ideas. None of us would like to have a picture of the Lord Jesus on the walls of our houses, for we could not be at all sure it was really the Lord at all. And if we were sure it was exactly like what He was outwardly, it would not supply any ground of love to Him. There is no genuine love to the Lord Jesus except as we apprehend what He is inwardly.
Now in the first scripture we find the Lord was assured that Mary and Joseph ought to have known that He would be occupied in His Father's business, or as the note reads, "That I ought to be in the things of my Father". Now we do not know the Lord at all until we understand that. He was a boy of twelve, but He was in the consciousness of sonship, He could speak of "my Father", and of being in *the things* of His Father. That is what makes Him so different from every other man, what marked Him off from everything in the world. He was wholly absorbed and occupied in the things of His Father. He brought those things here in His heart, so that men might know them, and He lived in them; and if we do not love Him in that character, we can hardly be said to love Him at all. That is, to love the Lord as He is, we need to see Him in relation to His Father. But perhaps a poor sinner
{8}
says, 'He died for my sins'. I do not depreciate that; it is true, it is what that Person conferred upon me. But what kind of Person is He in Himself? I shall never love Him until I know that. Gratitude in the heart of a believer for what He has done for him often does not go far; it very often stops short of love to Himself, to His own Person, and has very little separating effect from the world. But if we love Him in relation to the Father we cannot avoid being separated from the world which knows nothing of the Father, who is altogether in separation from the world. Indeed, John says, "If any one love the world, the love of the Father is not in him; because all that is in the world ... is not of the Father" (@1 John 2: 15, 16): All that is really blessed for men lies now in the knowledge of the Father. Jesus as a Boy of twelve was absorbed in His Father's things, and in that character He becomes an object of love to His own; He is carrying in His heart the secret of all the grace of God for men. If we love Him in that character, it shows we have apprehended the Father's things. For there is a whole system of things characterised as the Father's things, which are contrary to everything in the world. So if you have the Father's things brought to you by Jesus you *cannot* have the world. It is a very practical thing. So everything is possessed in Jesus; they are things which were designed by the Father to be the portion of Jesus. He is the only One that can give us any impression of them. Those who do love Him in that character have done with the wretched, worthless things of the world.
Again, the Lord said in His second recorded utterance, "Thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness". That gives me a true thought of Himself -- His Person. He had before Him to fulfil all righteousness -- all that was right. Although with Him there was no personal cause, He would go with the men who took a right line in repentance. We have to love Him in that character as the righteous One, and so we must take on the same character. I cannot love something in Him and go on with just the opposite. So it separates us from the
{9}
whole course of sin in ourselves and in the world. We have been attracted after the One who fulfilled all righteousness. Many believers are hung up for many years because they are not in the path of righteousness; they think they love the Lord but they do not. Often a very little bit of unrighteousness will hinder us. So that love for the Lord Jesus is a very practical thing, it adjusts us at every turn.
Then the Lord in speaking to the devil brings out some of the great and precious things that belong to His own Person. "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word which goes out through God's mouth". If we have finished with the world, what are we going on with? We cannot go on with a vacuum. We are too negative in the matter; there is too much negative christianity. The Lord as a Man here lived by every word that went out through God's mouth. There is no other wav to live. If we did not live on the word of God, we should starve. Christians not drawn into His manner of life do starve. He lived by every word of God. It is too great for me, and I do not question that. It is the character and quality of all life toward God, that we live by the communications of the blessed God. And we love Him if we apprehend Him in that character. Then we must take on that character -- love will surely go His way -- and it will make its practical impression on us.
He says, "Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God". That is, the Lord Jesus becomes an object of affection as One with absolute confidence in God. He was put on the pinnacle of the temple. Sometimes God puts His saints in a position of danger. The Lord was then, and he was as quiet and confiding and restful as at any moment in His life. Now this is the Person we love. It is really the test of our affection for the Lord. Sometimes we are trembling and fearful. Oh, if we only loved Him we should be drawn into the same blessed confidence He has in His God and Father.
"Thou shalt do homage to the Lord thy God, and him alone shalt thou serve". The Lord presents Himself here
{10}
as worshipping and serving God; that is, He is the true worshipper. No one could love the Lord Jesus Christ and not be a worshipper, for He is the true Worshipper. David, the great psalmist, praised Jehovah. Every expression of holy worship issued from Jesus. So that genuine love for the Lord Jesus Christ would transform us and fashion us in moral correspondence with Him. Worship and priestly service are the very highest things, but we speak of them to the young convert. The Lord spoke of worshippers for the Father to the woman of Samaria, who was only a convert of perhaps five minutes. No one can be happy until he is set in worshipful relationship with God. Christ came into manhood to be the model of how the worship and service of God is rendered in the highest.
These words are the setting forth of all that He is inwardly, and as we see and appreciate Him in this way, we take on the character of the One we love. If we admire the features of Christ they must come out in us. Of course it is a continual development with us, with small accessions from time to time, until we become like the Son of God, and get clearance from the world and all that is contrary to God. God give us to move in affectionate appreciation of the Lord Jesus Christ.

THE ASSEMBLY EXPRESSING THE GRACE OF HEAVEN
@Matthew 18:1 - 35
Ques. Would you say that the kingdom of the heavens stands connected with the One exalted, and the kingdom of God more in relation to the Spirit?
C.A.C. I thought so. The Lord in Matthew's gospel was on His way to the heavens to be the source there of an entirely new kind of influence, and it is a question for us as to how far we have entered into the kingdom of the heavens.
Rem. It is remarkable that the heavens rule, and that what corresponds with that is the spirit of a little child.
C.A.C. Yes, I suppose one must be conscious of dignity with God in order to become as a little child amongst men or with the brethren. The previous chapter ends with the light of sonship, "Then are the sons free". The Lord identifies Peter with Himself in that place of dignity with God; that gives wonderful support in view of taking up the exercises of this chapter.
Rem. That was seen perfectly in the Lord Himself; being who He was, there was great moral dignity in going down.
C.A.C. Yes; one in conscious dignity as a son can afford to dispense with any greatness that might attach to him in the world or amongst men, or even amongst the brethren. The importance of a little child lies in the fact that it is a subject of affection. It is a great thing to move about in the consciousness of being a subject of affection, loved by God and the Lord Jesus. I think that is how a little child according to God thinks of himself.
Ques. What would that mean here?
C.A.C. The Lord's words indicate that naturally we are otherwise; there is the necessity for everything being reversed. We have to be taken to pieces and put together on
{12}
a new principle: "Whoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child". We reach the condition of being a little child through the spiritual exercise of humbling oneself. It is an entirely new thought of greatness. Naturally we do not care for the kind of importance which being the subjects of love would give us; naturally we want some other kind of dignity or importance.
We read elsewhere of the Lord taking a little child in His arms, and He speaks of receiving one such little child. How good to be received as one who is in the arms of Jesus! People sing sometimes, 'Safe in the arms of Jesus'; but it is a most blessed thing to be received by the brethren as one who is in the arms of Jesus; that is the kind of importance that is covetable, and, after all, that is our true importance. "One such little child" becomes a true representation of Christ, so that those who receive such a little child receive Christ.
What spiritual importance that confers on us! If we lose natural importance we get spiritual importance. I suppose the most important person in any meeting is the brother or sister who is the best exponent of Christ; not the brother who has the greatest gift or the most attractive personality, but the one who is the best representative of Christ. Persons like that are of the most immense importance with the Father; that "little child" spirit is so important to the Father that He always has it represented before Him: "Their angels in the heavens continually behold the face of my Father who is in the heavens". It suggests the delight of the Father in having that condition represented before Him continually.
Rem. This chapter gives us what God values, and consequently what we are to value.
C.A.C. I think so. And it is a true conversion to get one's mind and affections free from the things that have place with men, and which are really an abomination to God, and to get, in place of all that, what has value with God and what is descriptive of Christ. There is in one who is truly "a little child" the absence of self-consideration because he is assured of the affection of which he is the object.
{13}
Rem. There could not be true administration according to God till we get this spirit.
C.A.C. That is the basis of the whole thing. When we think of administration we think of something big and official.
Rem. The Corinthians reigned as kings.
C.A.C. Yes, but there was no divine administration at Corinth; they were endowed with everything, but unable to use it rightly. We often have gifts and spiritual abilities without the power to use them rightly.
Rem. This is a wonderful conception of the kingdom of the heavens: the spirit of a little child.
C.A.C. Yes, the influence of the heavens has come in to produce it; the spirit of a little child will not come about any other way than by the personal influence of the One who is in the heavens. There is a tabernacle set in the heavens for the Sun, and that Sun in the heavens is exerting His influence: "There is nothing hid from the heat thereof" (@Psalm 19: 6). A certain sphere of influence stands in relation to Christ as the Sun in the heavens, and everything in that sphere is affected: "There is nothing hid from the heat thereof".
The thought of this raises a very important exercise as to things which would hinder that influence; we must do nothing to hinder the production or manifestation of that kind of spirit; so the Lord speaks of offending one of these little ones who believe in Him. He says of the one who does it that "it were profitable for him that a great millstone had been hanged upon his neck and he be sunk in the depths of the sea". We see thus the terrible character of any influence that would operate contrary to this "little child" spirit. If I bring in the influence of self-importance, and not only manifest it myself but influence others by it, it is a terrible thing in the sight of God.
Rem. What follows would show how this is to be dealt with.
C.A.C. Yes, we find it a very serious matter. Certain things which are as close to us as our own members may be
{14}
active to hinder this spirit, they may become an offence and a cause of stumbling. There is an exercise first about becoming an occasion of stumbling to another; then I find there are occasions of stumbling in myself. It may be a hand, or a foot, or an eye.
Rem. That shows what true self-judgment is; you not only cut off the offending member, but cast it from you, as having measured what it is in relation to God.
Ques. What is the thought of entering into life?
C.A.C. I suppose it is just the contrast to being cast into eternal fire. Life is that condition which is according to the thought of God for man in contrast to that which He rejects and casts into the hell of fire. There is such a thing as life according to God; that is, movements and active sensibilities that correspond with the pleasure of God. We find in ourselves certain things which are inconsistent with life. It is not simply we see they are wrong, that is negative, but the soul has apprehended something of the preciousness of life in a divine sense, and has set life before it as a prize to be won and entered into. What is unsuitable for entering into life, what would hinder one entering into life, must be dealt with with uncompromising severity.
Rem. It is only in the power of life that we can do that.
C.A.C. That is a most wholesome thing to remember. We can never get the victory over the flesh except in the power of life. A great many people are trying to be dead to the flesh, but we can only overcome what is of the flesh by being in the power of life.
Rem. That is always the way God works; we turn to God first and then we leave idols.
C.A.C. Yes, there must be a sense in the soul of the blessedness of life. Peter says, "For he that will love life and see good days, let him cause his tongue to cease from evil and his lips that they speak no guile" (@1 Peter 3: 10). If I allow something which is contrary to the thought of life, my influence will tend to promote it in others, and I shall be a snare
{15}
to them. The Lord's words suggest that we are to be quite prepared to be deprived of one eye, or to be maimed; we want to enter into life whatever the cost. I have often thought that if one had gone to the man in @Romans 7 and said, 'If you will consent to have your right arm or leg taken off you will be perfectly free', he would have answered, 'All right, off with them!' We get the *right* eye and the *right* hand in @Matthew 5, which emphasises the importance of it naturally. There may be that which is extremely important to you, and which you would not at all wish to lose as a natural person, yet coming into view of life, and having some appreciation of the kind of spirit suitable to God, you are prepared to deal summarily with it.
The Lord puts things in an extreme way; and he raises questions with every one of us as to the issue of what we are going on with. Is it the hell of fire? Is it something which must be absolutely refused by God and dealt with in consuming judgment? Or is it something which has the character of life, which is a matter of approbation with God? We do not always like to have things put so strongly, but the Lord puts them in the most serious light. The Lord raises questions, and He puts things in a serious light. Things that are a snare are not to be trifled with; whether it is an eye, or a foot, or a hand, it must go. It may be a thing you would greatly value naturally, but in view of life it must go. All this shows the character of persons who make up the assembly.
Rem. A soul who has gone through this exercise, and is characterised by the spirit of a little child, is an asset in the assembly.
C.A.C. Yes, he is severe on himself, but it is the severity of a little child. We have to put together these apparently incongruous figures; they all really fit together beautifully.
Rem. Severity with oneself in the administration of grace should mark us.
C.A.C. Yes, and it grows out of the "little child" spirit; it is in the sense of having come under divine affections, and
{16}
having learned touching lessons, that the Lord would teach, of the greatest importance in relation to the influence of heaven.
Then the more severe you are with yourself, the more tender you are in relation to others. Going after the straying sheep brings this out beautifully. The Son of man has come to save that which was lost. The man with a hundred sheep seeks one gone astray. I think it stands here in relation to the spirit in which you would regard a brother who had sinned against you; you would look on him as a sheep gone astray, and you would want to gain him.
Ques. Why does he rejoice more over the one recovered than the ninety-nine that went not astray?
C.A.C. I suppose because the recovered one has given occasion for peculiar activities of love. If you had a sheep go astray among the flock at S. you would expend a great deal of labour and exercise of love on that soul; and when it was recovered you would have more joy in that one than in the others, because of the peculiar intensity of exercise which you have had about that one, and not about the others. You would have peculiar exercises about that one, and you would have your compensation. What a beautiful spirit in the assembly!
The assembly is to take character from Christ, the little child is a representative of Christ; so if you receive a little child you receive Christ. Then those terrible influences which are so powerful in nature, and which often come in to turn one aside from that path, have to be judged uncompromisingly so that Christ may be in evidence. Then there is the beautiful spirit of gracious care going out to the straying sheep, the attention of the Owner more especially given to the one gone astray than to the ninety-nine! I have thought sometimes that brethren paid too much attention to those going on badly, but I see it is a beautiful feature of Christ.
"If thy brother sin against thee". We are all more or less a test of each other's state of soul; that is one reason why we
{17}
are put together. J.N.D. said that often when we think we are judging other people, the Lord is really by their means judging our own state of soul. That is an exercising thing to remember. I may see much that is wrong in another person, and I may think I am right in being severe in my judgment of it, but the Lord may be really using it to disclose the condition of my own spirit. If a brother sins against me I have to think of it first of all as a test of my spirit.
We often begin by assuming that it is a manifestation of his bad state, but we ought to begin by considering that it is a test of our own spirit. It is very nice to sit down in a reading and admire the conception of the "little child" spirit, but it is another thing when we are tested as to whether we are of that spirit! We may find that instead of being little children we are very self-important personages.
The true character of the testimony now is that it is the manifestation of influences which emanate from Christ in the heavens. There is not a single feature in common between the present world system of things and the kingdom of the heavens. In the early part of this gospel the kingdom of the heavens is announced as drawn nigh; it was then within three and a half years of taking form in Christ in heaven; from heaven He was going to exert all those influences to which He gave expression in His ministry here; and He is doing so now. He does not support anything else; so that any administration that is contrary to it must be human, not divine. The brother who sins is to be reproved with the object of gaining him. If my brother sins against me he is a sheep gone astray; he would not have sinned otherwise. Now my concern should be to gain him.
Very often we go to get what we suppose to be our rights, very much like the man who took his fellow-bondman by the throat and said, "Pay me if thou owest anything". We are not to go in that spirit. We should wish to gain our brother -- to have him again in brotherly relations. We have, for the moment, lost him, but we want to gain him. No pains are too
{18}
great to take to gain him. It is not exactly that I want what is due to me; that would be like trying to make him pay up; I want to gain my brother.
Ques. Is that why the question of repenting is not brought in here? You do not even demand that?
C.A.C. Yes. On the governmental side it may be necessary that there should be repentance and even restitution, but that is not dwelt upon here. Your concern here is to gain your brother. Hence if you find that your brother will not listen to you, you are grieved to find that you have not grace enough to make any impression on him. So you say, 'I must bring more grace to bear on him, to gain him', and you take with you one or two besides. The thing becomes more serious now because every matter now stands upon the word of two witnesses or of three.
Your exercise is of such a character that it commands the support of one or two others. That safeguards the assembly from being troubled by frivolous or vexatious complaints. If the brother, or the other one or two whom he took with him, had known what it was to cut off a hand or a foot, they would have power with the one who had sinned. The chapter supposes they are that kind of person -- persons who have the spirit of a little child, and who know how to be very severe with themselves but very careful and gracious about others.
If one goes to see a brother who has sinned with that spirit, or takes one or two more with that spirit, he is very likely to gain his brother. But if the brother will not listen there is a further course open; it can be told to the assembly. The assembly can hear such a matter, and can speak with divine authority.
Ques. The assembly would bring more grace to bear, would it not?
C.A.C. Yes, the assembly would speak according to the grace of heaven. There is nothing on earth that can speak with the grace and authority of heaven like the assembly; it is the last and greatest voice, so that if a person will not hear
{19}
the assembly you are exempt from any further regard for him as a brother. The Lord absolves you from any further obligations to regard him as a brother. You are not called upon to determine whether he is a brother or not, but "let him be to thee as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer".
Rem. The question here is not raised as to what may be eventually done.
C.A.C. No, the assembly is left to speak or to act with its own spiritual intelligence; no instructions are given as to how the assembly is to act or what it is to say. But whether it binds or looses the Lord commits Himself to it, the thing is bound or loosed in heaven, it is ratified in heaven. Where things are done in assembly conditions the Lord commits Himself absolutely to what it has done.
Rem. If the spirit of a little child predominates in the assembly, and if there is the spirit of grace in all that is done, and each one is self-judged, cutting off hand or foot, one can understand how a company like that would act according to what is pleasing to God, so that what they did would be ratified in heaven.
C.A.C. Yes indeed, and all that accentuates the terrible condition of anyone who will not hear the assembly. But all this raises great exercise as to assembly action. What may be regarded as assembly action is not the product of fleshly indignation and strong feelings.
Ques. Do you not think perhaps that there may have been with us a danger of being too much on the judicial line?
C.A.C. I think so. But one has hardly known a single instance of this scripture being carried out; I have never known a case in my experience of anything of this kind being told to the assembly. With what a voice the assembly could speak! This supposes the assembly has a voice, but I doubt whether we know much about the assembly speaking. This suggests the assembly speaking to the brother who has sinned with divine authority in a restorative way. It is not telling him that he is excommunicated or that the brethren cannot walk
{20}
with him; there is a previous speaking to that. Have we left sufficient room for the assembly speaking as the supreme voice of grace and heavenly authority -- speaking, not in a judicial way, but in a restorative way?
I have thought for some time that this has been largely overlooked, and that the Lord has provided a resource that we have not availed ourselves of as we might. I quite own the difficulty of the present state of things, but the principle abides. May it not be that many local grievances and roots of bitterness, which seem to go on interminably, do so because we have not used the supreme influence which the Lord has made available?
Rem. You tell it to the assembly in order that the brother may be recovered.
C.A.C. Yes. You want the assembly to speak to him in the same way that you have been speaking to him, and also in the same way that the one or two you took with you spoke to him, but to speak with the additional weight which belongs to that august company which is here on earth as the representative of the heavenly Christ. If the assembly speaks, it must surely speak with the same kind of voice as the heavenly Christ.
Ques. How does the assembly express its voice?
C.A.C. The Lord clearly intimates that the assembly is capable, not only of hearing but of speaking. I think that we should consider this. In what follows, the Lord speaks of "two of you". J.B.S. said, "two of you", not any two, but two of you. Two of the assembly, and of true assembly spirit.
People say that there is no assembly now as a known company to which things can be told, and that therefore we can not hear the voice of the assembly. That in a sense is true; and to take things of this kind up today we need a plentiful supply of the "little child" spirit. But we could hardly think that this wonderful provision would cease to be available -- at any rate in the principle of it -- as long as the assembly is on earth. In this day of the church's presence on earth it is the power of a heavenly influence that is felt.

The power is inimitable and irresistible, so that if a man will not hear that voice -- the power of it, the tenderness and expressiveness of it are so great -- if a man will not hear it, he is absolutely an outlaw; he puts himself in the place of a heathen and a publican. If even two persons spoke in the power of that voice, it would have the same character, whatever the ruin may be. One feels much exercised by the thought of it as feeling how little one is spiritually able to act in such grace and power. But the Lord distinctly calls us to consider this as a spiritual reality which in His mind characterises the present system.
The case of the wicked person in Corinthians is on a different line; public, disciplinary action of the assembly became necessary in that case. There are certain things that are altogether unsuitable to God's assembly, and cannot have their place there, but even so, action is with a view to recovery and restoration. The Corinthians did not understand this, they were first careless and lax, not even exercised about the terrible sin among them, but when they did act they acted with great zeal and were perhaps inclined to overlook that their action had restoration in view. Then the apostle had to write them another letter to tell them to confirm their love of him. But in @Matthew 18 the assembly speaking is on the line of gaining the brother. If he will not hear, other action may become necessary, but that is not quite the speaking of verse 17.
Rem. The year of release would show that debts may be discharged by being wiped off altogether.
C.A.C. Yes, the year of release brings out the wealth of the people. A privilege is extended to every creditor of making a release, and making it to *Jehovah*. If you transfer the account to Jehovah it is not a bad debt. What a compensation to one's spirit to be able to smile on all one's debtors as having made a release!
The coming to light of our true measure is the real starting point of increase. The very fact that we are made to feel how small we are is the way to begin to get a bit bigger; we
{22}
acquire growth that way.
Two or three gathered together to Christ's name are commanded by the name of the One who is in the heavens. He is in the heavens, but His name has exerted its power and brought two or three together in the interest and bond of that name; such will have the support of the glorious One in the heavens. Not only may Christ be seen in a single babe, so that if you receive one such you receive Christ, but there is a collective setting forth of Christ, and all in virtue of His support. He supports "two or three" in their prayers so that they pray with the support of Christ. I should like to know more of it as a spiritual experience.
The "seventy times seven" indicates an illimitable capacity for forgiveness.

ASSEMBLY DISCIPLINE
@Matthew 18: 15 - 18
The assembly is entrusted by the Lord with administrative authority to pronounce judgment on moral questions which may be brought before it as the supreme court of appeal on earth. The sin of one brother against another is the particular matter in question in @Matthew 18. The assembly may bind or loose: it may hold the brother to be guilty of the sin which he is alleged to have committed, or it may loose him from the charge. If the assembly binds the things upon him, it is bound upon him in heaven: the assembly holds him guilty and heaven holds him guilty. It is a sin which breaks in on the holy relationship of two brothers. If the offender does not bow to the judgment of the assembly he is no longer entitled to be acknowledged as a brother. The Lord does not say how the assembly is to regard him, but the assembly could not fail to act in accordance with its own judgment and the judgment of heaven. The particular thing is bound upon him on earth and in heaven: he can only get clear of it by repentance, upon which the assembly would loose him from what it has bound upon him. It is to be noted that it is "whatsoever"; that is, it refers to the conduct which is bound or loosed, not exactly to the person but the particular thing which he is charged with. In @John 20 it is "whose soever"; it is persons whose sins are remitted or retained, and, I believe, more in a gospel sense.
Now it certainly appears to me that a public disregard of the Lord's authority, and of the rights and claims of His love, is not less serious than a sin against a brother. The Lord's supper is a matter of His authority. The assembly could never allow that it is optional whether saints of the assembly break bread or not. Paul says, "We all partake of that one loaf" (@1 Corinthians 10: 17). How the Lord regards neglect of this institution of love we may gather from the serious
{24}
consequences which followed upon the neglect of the passover (@Numbers 9). One who habitually remains away from the Lord's supper gives up practically his place in the body publicly; he goes voluntarily away from the assembly.
Now, surely, the assembly is to exercise all the grace of heaven in seeking to restore such a one to the sense of what is due to the Lord. The assembly would seek by all available means to bring the Lord into His right place in the heart of such a one. But the assembly cannot allow that fellowship go on just the same when the central act of fellowship is ignored or, at any rate, not partaken of. The assembly may forbear taking any action, and leave such a case to individual, pastoral care, but to leave it there indefinitely would tend to looseness as to our associations. The instructions as to associations in @2 Timothy 2 are very precise. We are to withdraw from what is unrighteous, and to follow righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart. We cannot say that it is following righteousness to keep away from the brethren, and if the assembly has to pronounce a judgment it cannot "loose" such a thing as that. It cannot possibly say that such conduct is to go without blame. This would be a dreadfully loose judgment and it would not be ratified in heaven. We must bear in mind that "a little leaven leavens the whole lump" (@1 Corinthians 5: 6).
If one whose ways are contrary to the truth of the fellowship does not repent when admonished, and finally declines to be visited by the brethren, it necessarily brings pastoral care to an end, as far as the brethren in care are concerned, whatever opportunity individuals may still have to approach the person. To refuse to be visited is such a disregard of the Lord's care, and of what He has set up in the assembly to watch for souls, that it can only be regarded in a most serious light. The assembly would not be prepared to "loose" that principle of conduct or to say that it must be held free of blame. It seems to me that it would have to say that such a person must lie under the imputation of sin until such time as
{25}
God might in mercy grant repentance. Its fellowship could not be extended to one who was insubject to its judgment. So that it seems to me that, when such a definite point of insubjection is reached, the fellowship of the saints would have to be withdrawn from the person who acted thus. The assembly, if it speaks at all, must speak in support of the Lord's authority, and of the truth of the fellowship, and of that principle of care which the Lord has set up in the assembly. He makes known His mind as the need arises and it can never be said that the assembly is helpless in the presence of a difficulty. It may have to wait upon the Lord, and go through much humbling exercise and searching of heart, but it can never be held up by any form of evil so that that evil remains unjudged.
{26}
THE LORD GIVING SIGHT TO THE BLIND (FROM C.A.C.¬S NOTES)
It has come before me that there is much instruction for us in the seven instances recorded of the Lord giving sight to the blind. It was held, I believe, by the rabbis that this was a miracle reserved to the Messiah, and though it was spoken of prophetically in the Old Testament there is no instance there of a blind man receiving sight. Nor is it recorded in the New Testament that anyone save the Lord ever performed this miracle. Paul being sent to "open their eyes" referred to his public service amongst the Gentiles in setting the truth of the position before them; it was not exactly doing a divine work in them, but bringing the truth to them so as to leave them responsible to turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God.
But the giving of sight to the blind as it was done by the Lord seems to speak clearly of a divine operation by which men become capable of apprehending what has been introduced into the world in the Person of Christ. The presence of light is not sufficient. There is a great deal of light in Christendom, for the Scriptures are there and much spiritual ministry of the truth, but the capacity to apprehend it in a spiritual way is lacking. When the Lord was here the whole light of God was here, but men did not apprehend it; they were blind and the precious realities which were present were hidden from them. And it is an exercising thing to consider that we may be in the presence of much spiritual light without having any spiritual apprehension of it. But there is great encouragement in the sevenfold witness of the record in the gospels that Christ, and Christ only, is the One who can give us sight, and who delights to do so.
When John the baptist sent to ask Him, "Art thou the coming one? or are we to wait for another?" the first proof
{27}
that He gave was that John's disciples were to report to him that "blind men see". Every ray of divine light is in Christ, but we may be assured of this and yet feel how very little of it we have apprehended so as to have the continued joy of it in our hearts. We need His precious and divine service to enable us to see, and there is a direct and personal character about this so that we know that it is His own action and touch that has done it. He has not delegated this power or service to any other; it is in every case a personal transaction of Christ with the individual soul.
The first two persons are spoken of in @Matthew 9: 27 - 31. This is in an interesting connection, for the whole of this chapter save the last four verses records what took place in "his own city". This was, no doubt, Capernaum, to which city He had removed from Nazareth at the beginning of His ministry (@Matthew 4: 12). It was a place of great light, so that the Lord could speak of it as having been raised up to heaven. It would represent a place specially favoured by God, and where special testimony was rendered to what was there in Christ. Emmanuel was there, having chosen to go to a people sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death, and to make that "his own city". So that there was a remarkably full presentation in Capernaum of what was there in Him. Forgiveness and power for helpless men, a call of infinite grace to sinners, the Bridegroom was there for the joy of those who were "sons of the bridechamber"; perfect healing for the woman with the issue of blood -- a figure of the state of Israel in uncleanness -- and the ruler's daughter raised up from death. "And the fame of it went out into all that land".
Now all this seems to be presented as having exercised attraction upon two blind men, and as having produced faith in their souls that Jesus could open their eyes. What marks these two men is that they come in faith. Jesus did not propose to do for them anything beyond what was according to their faith; He loves to be counted on, and to do all that He is counted on for. Now this raises the question as to how far we have been personally affected by what we know of God as
{28}
having come near to men in Jesus -- Emmanuel. Has it led us to desire the power of spiritual apprehension? Has it given us faith to count upon Him to give us ability to see all that is there to be seen? Do we read the gospels historically as so many wonderful incidents, or do we definitely seek from the Lord ability to see the greatness and glory of what was there in the Person of Jesus?
"He touched their eyes". It is noticeable that in every instance of the Lord giving sight, save that in @Matthew 12: 22, 23, He touched the eyes of the blind. I think the exception was because there the man was possessed by a demon, and there is no instance that I know of in which the Lord touched one who had a demon. He cast out the spirits with a word, we are told (@Matthew 8: 16). In dealing with demons there was not the element of sympathy which is conveyed by a touch; they were dispossessed by the word of authority. So that when blindness was directly traceable to the presence of a demon we can understand why there was no touch. But in every other instance there was a touch of personal contact.
{29}
GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MARK
{30}
{31}
THE SYNAGOGUE
@Mark 1: 23, 39; @Mark 3: 1; @Mark 6: 2, 3; @Mark 13: 9
The synagogue is mentioned in connection with the Lord and/or His disciples five times in this gospel. They are in chapter l: 23 where there was a man possessed by an unclean spirit, in chapter 1: 39 where the Lord was preaching, in chapter 3: 12 where there was a man with his hand dried up, in chapter 6: 2, 3 where the Lord began to teach and many were offended, and in chapter 13: 9 where the Lord speaks of the disciples being delivered up.
In each instance in the synagogue the Lord acts sovereignly. There is no request for deliverance or healing. It is an unsympathetic atmosphere, for they watched "that they might accuse him". But the Lord will work therein compassionate tenderness of heart. Profession without faith is a very hardening thing: it dries up the power of appropriation and it resists the thought of that power being realised or conferred. But the Lord of the sabbath could not forget the original character of the sabbath. The fact that divine working was finished, and that "God saw everything that he had made, and behold it was very good" (@Genesis 1: 31), was what made the sabbath possible. If they had thought of this they might well have asked, Are things "very good"? Is it all rest and blessing? Are things in such a state that God could pronounce them "very good"? Is it "very good" that a man should have his hand dried up (chapter 3: 1) so that he cannot take hold of blessing from God? The Son of man comes in as Lord of the sabbath to show that the sabbath was blessing and rest and liberty, and that it was for man's benefit, not for
{32}
bondage or to leave him without blessing from God. He would put everything right on man's side that man might have the sabbath that it pleased God he should have. The new garment, the new wine, the cornfields (chapter 2: 21 - 28) all spoke of the "very good" things which would confer a true sabbath on man. But then man lacks the power to appropriate these things. The more he professes to know God without really knowing Him the less ability he has to appropriate.
The Lord brings to light the state of their hearts. They would have preferred things to remain as they were, the form of the sabbath without any of the reality. They did not care that the man's hand was dried; they rather wished that it might remain so.
But the Son of man was there to serve God in serving man, and He goes on with His blessed service undeterred by the hardening of their heart, though angry and distressed thereby. He would in sovereign power give the ability to lay hold upon the blessing that was near, but not without calling for exercise on the part of the man. He calls him first to "Rise up and come into the midst". He must move at the word of Jesus into a position which singled him out and brought his infirmity before all. The Lord does not do things in a corner. If a man has had a faithless profession, and the Lord is going to give him power to lay hold of the blessing that is available, it means that he comes into view as the subject of divine working. It is a great thing when a person is willing to be known as a subject of mercy.
Then the man is called on to "Stretch out thy hand". He has to own in a very distinct way the truth of his condition, but he does it as one to whom Jesus has become "the Lord of the sabbath". The stretching out of his hand expressed his deep conviction that the power of God was there in Jesus to command true sabbath conditions, to bring in all on his side that should be "very good". A dried hand went out towards Jesus, but he took it back to him with a vigorous grip. The
{33}
virtue lay in the One who was Lord to command the blessing and to command the man for the blessing. The secret of all lay in the fact that Jesus had become Lord of the sabbath to him. He was not that to them, but He was to the man who had power now to lay hold of all the rich and full provision that was available.
Now one would seek to gain some conception of how the Spirit of God would apply the teaching of this incident to ourselves. I suppose we all believe that there is very much available. Perfect righteousness, fulness of joy in the knowledge of the love of God, and all the harvest of the land of divine purpose in a heavenly Christ. But we feel how feeble we are in power to lay hold of it. The remedy would be, I gather from this incident, that we should give the Lord His place as Lord of the sabbath. He can command sabbath conditions; He can displace everything on our side which hinders us from laying hold of all that is in Himself. We have to stretch out our hand towards Him as owning that He alone can supply the ability to honour God by appropriating what His grace and love have provided. The apostle Paul puts it very beautiful when he says, "The grace of our Lord surpassingly over-abounded with faith and love, which is in Christ Jesus" (@1 Timothy 1: 14). The faith and the love have come from Him, and they are in Christ Jesus. Paul found everything in "Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me power" (@1 Timothy 1: 12). He stretched out his hand to Him. We are welcomed to all that is in Him. The more effectually we learn how "dried" everything is on our side, the more ready we are to stretch it out to Him so that we may get a new ability which has its source and its strength in Him. So that in all things we "boast in Christ Jesus, and do not trust in flesh" (@Philippians 3: 3). "Faith and love which are in Christ Jesus" is also in @2 Timothy 1: 13.
"His hand was restored". There is then ability to serve as we have seen in @1 Timothy 1. This is the end in view, that one should be able to serve in liberty. All that we take hold of as
{34}
provided for us is to give us strength for service. True Sabbath conditions are needed, rest and ability to lay hold of what is provided; then there is strength for service.
There is not only no sympathy in the synagogue but positive antagonism, and Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea. There is a vast field for service. We may have to withdraw from much that is in the place of profession, but that leads to enlargement as to the sphere of service. Things are restricted in the synagogue but at the "sea" there is a very extended sphere. The greater the sphere of service the more important that we should not be influenced by those we serve. That seems to be the thought in the "little ship". It is that the crowd might not press upon Him. "Do I seek to please men? If I were yet pleasing men, I were not Christ's bondman" (@Galatians 1: 10); "Not as pleasing men, but God, who proves our hearts" (@1 Thessalonians 2: 4). Barnabas and Paul would not be influenced by the men in Lystra (@Acts 14). The Lord would not have the testimony of unclean spirits even though it were a true one.
The little ship, the rebuking of the unclean spirits, and the going up into the mountain all seem to show how separate the servant is to be. It is being taken apart to an elevation far above the level of the world in company with Jesus that we learn how to serve. Power lies in that.
There is sovereignty in the appointment of the twelve and in the special place of the three.
I think it may be helpful to see that the end in view in this section is that there are those sitting around Christ whom He can regard as His mother and His brethren. They were doing the will of God. Outside is religious hatred, the great outstanding feature of which is a speaking injuriously against the Holy Spirit, and, seen in His relatives, natural inability to understand Him.
A deeply interesting series of incidents follows in the cornfields, the synagogue, the sea, the mountain and the house.
{35}
These two Sabbath incidents are very instructive (chapters 2: 23 - 28; 3: 1 - 6). The harvest had come to maturity. It really set forth the complete provision of God for man in Christ. But man under the legal system was not at liberty to appropriate that provision: his hand was dried; such was the case with the Pharisees. In the cornfields we see liberty given on the divine side by the Lord of the Sabbath, but then power is needed on our side, and the Lord of the Sabbath undertakes to bring this in also. God come in to bless must meet everything. It is by the virtue that is in Christ that all is met on our side. What James said is still true, that "Moses, from generations of old, has in every city those who preach him, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath" (@Acts 15: 21).
{36}
SONS OF THE BRIDECHAMBER
@Mark 2: 1 - 28
The Lord would identify His own with Himself in the blessed service (see @Mark 1: 17; @Mark 2: 15; @Mark 3: 9). Then they are formally commissioned in chapter 3: 13 - 19 and are sitting around Him at the end of that chapter.
The disciples were not fasting. They were divinely taught not to fast. They were "sons of the bridechamber" -- a remarkable title. It implies an understanding of who was present: the Bridegroom was there. The One who was entitled to Israel's affections had come to win them by His service of love. "Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep" (@Hosea 12: 12). The Lord exalts His disciples into a very blessed communion with His own thoughts by calling them "sons of the bridechamber". The presence of the Bridegroom was a peculiar moment, and fasting was not in keeping with it. If Israel missed her opportunity it would be a time of fasting indeed. But the Lord plainly declares that what He was bringing in was new and it could not be connected with the old garment. You cannot connect Christ with the righteousness of man after the flesh. There must be a new garment to suit the Bridegroom -- to suit the One who serves in love and who wins the bride that way; she must be clothed with His worth, for nothing would suit His eye or His heart but that. To bring in a little of Christ only makes matters worse (verses 21, 22).
So the new wine must have a new vessel. It is a question of what God is for man as set forth in the Bridegroom. But then there must be a suitability in the vessel -- a God-given capacity. The new vessels are then divinely taught and formed. The capacity is in affection.
{37}
A TIME OF FEASTING
@Mark 2: 18 - 22
@Mark 2: 18 - 22 helps to the understanding of chapter 14: 25. The disciples were "the sons of the bridechamber", and they had the Bridegroom with them. There was a festive character about the association in which they were together. It is striking that the Lord is never called the Bridegroom in the epistles, although repeatedly so in the gospels. The disciples of John and of the Pharisees were fasting: they were not festive. Their reasons for fasting might have been very different -- John's disciples fasting in genuine repentance, and the Pharisees¬ disciples fasting in self-righteousness, but neither were happy. They did not realise what a wonderful moment it was -- that the Bridegroom was there! He came to call sinners, not in this chapter to repentance, but to the joy of what was in Himself. It was the time of Israel's opportunity. Everything was brought to them in the favour of God, healing of bodies, healing of souls, deliverance from every oppression of the devil, from every burden of conscience; God was made known amongst them in the plenitude of His goodness; every promise was available for them in His anointed One. Every joy that God could bring in for His people was there: "Thou shalt be called, My delight is in her, and thy land, Married; ... with the joy of the bridegroom over the bride, shall thy God rejoice over thee" (@Isaiah 62: 4, 5). The prophet had spoken of "a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined" (@Isaiah 25: 6). It was all there, as to the substance of it, in the Bridegroom. He was God's salvation, Jehovah's servant, the righteousness, the adornment of His people. The Lord was consciously all that in the midst of Israel: life for them, joy for them, peace for them. And in His account the disciples were "sons of the bridechamber".
{38}
They were in the midst of Israel understanding what was there in Him: how could they fast? The Lord had joy in being with them in that blessed character. It was what He was on God's part in fulness of blessing, whatever men might be. He drank of the divine joy of it, and His disciples shared with Him as sons of the bridechamber. They would have desired Israel to receive Him, but, alas, the bride was not ready. I think the Lord would have us to understand what a joy He had in being with His own, and in the midst of Israel, as the full blessing of God. It was a time that terminated, but it had its own sweetness and delight for Him and for them. He drank, in that sense, of the fruit of the vine until it became manifest that that character of things must end. But it is a blessed association in which He and they were found those three and a half years. We lose a good deal if we do not take account of it. How blessed that He should be here, able to say, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach glad tidings to the poor; he has sent me to preach to captives deliverance, and to the blind sight, to send forth the crushed delivered, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord" (@Luke 4: 18, 19). When John sent to know whether He was really the Bridegroom, as we might say, He said, "Go, bring back word to John of what ye have seen and heard: that blind see, lame walk, lepers are cleansed, deaf hear, dead are raised, poor are evangelised" (@Luke 7: 22). The twelve were sent out with power and authority over all demons and to heal diseases. They took part in the ministry as in feeding the multitude. Then the seventy go "two and two before his face into every city and place where he himself was about to come" (@Luke 10: 1). They healed the sick, the demons were subject. The disciples were eye-witnesses of and attendants on the Word. They formed His retinue throughout that blessed triumphal progress, for such it really was, and we must not allow His rejection to obscure the glorious character of what was seen in Him. The eyes were blessed which saw the things they saw. Many prophets and kings had
{39}
desired to see them but did not see them. What was more than Solomon was there.
The disciples are seen here as the sons of the bridechamber. That is, they are in communion with the Bridegroom as to all His thoughts in relation to the bride. The bride does not appear in the gospels, though John the baptist says the Bridegroom has her. She is hidden from view. John is the friend of the Bridegroom; the disciples are sons of the bridechamber. The kingdom of the heavens is made like to ten virgins who go forth to meet the Bridegroom. Jehovah was there as the Bridegroom, ready, as it were, to enter into marital relations with Israel. His Anointed was there to woo and win her, but she does not come into view. The Bridegroom has been manifested, but Israel as the bride has not yet appeared. I think that is why the bride is, as it were, hidden in the gospels; we never see her, but we do see those, like John, who are in sympathy with the Bridegroom and who share His thoughts and service with regard to her as sons of the bridechamber. And there are those who in virgin character go forth to meet Him to go in with Him to the marriage. But we do not see the bride.
In the epistles we get the saints espoused to one Man, to be presented a chaste virgin to Christ. They have become dead to the law to be to Another. The assembly is in the place of the wife to Christ (@Ephesians 5). John alone of all the inspired writers brings the assembly into view as the bride, the Lamb's wife. This is the holy city in the millennial age, and in the eternal state she is seen "prepared as a bride adorned for her husband" (@Revelation 21: 2). She has a voice now as saying with the Spirit, "Come". But the Bridegroom is not mentioned under that designation: it is the Lamb. He takes the bride as the One who has suffered and died. The bride is not seen as such until after the marriage, so that she is then also the wife, save in the one passage "the Spirit and the bride say, Come" (@Revelation 22: 17). John having seen the bride as the Lamb's wife in glory, brings back the bride character into the
{40}
present time, and the assembly as the bride in concert with the Spirit says, "Come".
I think the Bridegroom, as spoken of in the gospels, would set forth what was there in Him for Israel. He was there to take up affectionate relations with them if they had been ready. But that could not be without His becoming the Passover for them, and this involved the taking away of the Bridegroom. The joy of the bridechamber (the fruit of the vine that He referred to in chapter 14: 25) could not be His according to the flesh. He went out of that condition through death, making known His own love and the love of God in a still deeper way than could have been known while the Bridegroom was here, but He will resume His relations with Israel in a new way in the kingdom of God. He does not continue with His own as the Bridegroom. His association with them in that character after the flesh ceased, to be taken up in a new way in the kingdom of God.
He was bringing in a new order of things which could not be joined on to the old, new wine which could not be put in the old skins. Something quite new was there, and something which could not be used to patch up man's old garment. He must have a new robe altogether, no patchwork. "Only in Jehovah, shall one say, have I righteousness and strength" (@Isaiah 45: 24). To bring in a bit of that kind of righteousness and tack it on to man's old rags would only make matters worse. No one puts new wine in old skins. This striking figure shows the inward energy and power of what came in by the Bridegroom which required new conditions on man's side to hold it. Forms and ordinances suited to man in the flesh could not be the vessel of the new wine. It must have new conditions; the new skins I take to be that the condition of faith is brought in on man's side, taking the place of ordinances. All that is of God as set forth in the Bridegroom can only be held in faith. There must be something on man's side which is not there by nature, something which is the product of divine working and which is capable of holding the
{41}
new wine. That is faith, divinely wrought in the soul. The disciples of Jesus had faith in Him. They understand that He was the Bridegroom, and that what was present could not be limited to the forms of judaism. It was all the activity of God Himself come near to His people to serve them by His Son. How could this be put into legal forms, or limited by what man was?
Then the cornfields were another figure of God's grace to His people, and the disciples were in liberty to avail themselves of it. But the Pharisees would have limited them by legal restrictions. God had made the Sabbath on account of man. His thought from the beginning was to bless man in relation to Himself. Man thinking of his own pettiness could not take in the greatness of God's thought, and he puts himself in bondage. But the Son of man was Lord of the Sabbath. He could give it its true character as speaking of rest and refreshment for men. And how it all spoke to Him! The whole golden crop had sprung up out of death in resurrection power as food for man. The wave-sheaf had been offered six days before as the acceptance of the people so that they might in holy freedom enjoy the fruit of the land. How He must have thought of it all in its spiritual significance! In the acceptance of Christ how could there be legal restrictions? All was really now according to His acceptance and His lordship. David had need and hungered, and he ate the shewbread; he was in liberty as knowing God. What were petty restrictions if Jehovah's Servant was there, the Lord of the Sabbath? To bring such in was only to prove that they did not know Him or the One who sent Him.
{42}
THE ENJOYMENT OF LIBERTY
@Mark 3: 1 - 25
Rem. You were reminding us on a previous occasion that the atmosphere of the synagogue was not good, and that it did not tend to liberty.
C.A.C. Well, the man's hand was withered there. I think religious profession without faith is a very hardening and withering thing. The Lord comes in there to get something out of it for God. It was not a sympathetic atmosphere at all. "They watched him if he would heal him on the Sabbath, that they might accuse him" (verse 2). The Lord was undeterred by the chilling atmosphere and He went on with His service. He could not be hindered by it but He felt it. Liberty for service is not so much found in the synagogue as by the sea. There are restrictions and limitations in the synagogue, but expansion by the sea. The Lord is still seen as Lord of the Sabbath. He seems to take that title with reference to liberty for the appropriation of what divine grace has made available for us.
For us the cornfields would set forth all that has come to maturity in Christ, the full provision of God for man; the Lord gives liberty on the divine side there, but here, in the synagogue, conditions on man's side have to be met. The cornfields are thrown open, but conditions on our side have to be met. The same Lord of the Sabbath who brought in liberty on the divine side brings in conditions on our side, that we may appropriate and enjoy it. I think it is a serious consideration. The provision is illimitable, the new garment, the new wine, the Sabbath, and the cornfields! But on man's side there is no power to avail himself of it. The sufficiency of Jesus has to be proved in connection with that. I have no power to avail myself of the good that God has provided except by the personal power and grace of the Son of man. It involves a personal action on His part.
{43}
My impression is that when the Lord came in as the Lord of the Sabbath He came in with all the original thoughts of the Sabbath in His mind, to make available to man all that God had provided. He would go back to the original thought. God finished all His work "and behold it was very good" (@Genesis 1: 31). That is the original idea of the Sabbath, an order of things set up concerning which the blessed God could say, "It was very good". His thought was, firstly, to enjoy it in His rest, and secondly, to have man to enjoy it with Him. There was, firstly, what God found in it, and secondly, His great thought that man should enter into His rest. If these people in the synagogue had taken in that original thought, they would have asked, 'Is it very good that there should be this wonderful provision and man unable to avail himself of it?' No! But the Lord Jesus came in to bring about conditions that are "very good", and to enable man to enjoy them. What a proposal for us today! What you find is that man was content that the man should remain with his hand withered. He rather wished that he should go on as he was. We have here a divine work that could only be accomplished by Jesus as the Lord of the Sabbath. We all need Him in this character; amazing wealth and blessedness has come in! We all believe that the good that has come in from God in Christ is immeasurable. Perfect righteousness, full joy in the love of God, a wonderful harvest of God's thoughts in connection with a heavenly Christ, but how far are we in the good of it? It entails personal acquaintance with Christ in a very individual way. The disciples were in liberty and able to enjoy what there was in the cornfields. The synagogue represents the sphere of profession where man professed to know God, but did not know Him. There is nothing so hardening. It is the most terrible thing possible to profess to know God and not to know Him. In the synagogue the Lord always acts in sovereignty, in the sovereign compassion of His own tender heart. He takes account of our state and comes in to meet it according to God, and to give us power to appropriate. If we
{44}
all stretched out our dried hands to Him, and got them restored, He would be delighted.
Ques. Would it be "the obedience of faith"?
C.A.C. It is very much like it. Exercises are called into being on the part of the man. It is very important to see that the first thing He says to the man is, "Rise up and come into the midst". He calls upon him to move. He has to move at the word of Jesus.
Rem. There is no question of inability when He speaks.
C.A.C. The man who moves at the word of Jesus and comes into the midst becomes an object of attention. The Lord works that way. He does not work in a corner. It is a principle with the Lord. There has to be such a movement that attention is called to the one who moves. As soon as Jesus becomes Lord to us, Lord of the Sabbath, we are prepared to move at His word. It is the first step to the enjoyment of spiritual blessing.
Rem. And you can move!
C.A.C. You can, and confession of the mouth follows. You have moved, and somebody says, 'Why have you moved?' Confession is always the answer to a challenge in Scripture. Confession is not when a boy or girl goes home to their rejoicing Christian parents and tells them that he or she has been found by the Saviour, but rather when a boy goes to school, for instance, and his school-friends invite him to do so and so, and he refuses. They say, 'What is the matter with you, Johnny?' 'Jesus has become Lord to me'. That is confession. It is "before Pontius Pilate the good confession" (@1 Timothy 6: 13). This man was a public confessor when he moved into the midst. If Jesus is really Lord to me and I begin to move at His word I will soon begin to get the virtue that is in Him. It is what you get for yourself. It is a wonderful moment when a man is willing to let all know that he is an object of mercy, an evidence of God's election. That is what this man did. We want more publicity. We should pay great attention to the details of the gospels. Am I possessed of the
{45}
Christ of God in this particular character? The Lord exposes the adversaries; He applies a test, as it were, to see if there was any kind of divine sensibility there (verse 4).
One step taken at the word of Jesus is a wonderful start, one practical step. It puts you in the midst and marks you off at once in the world. There is only one sympathetic heart in the synagogue, "But they were silent". The man stands forth confessing that Jesus had become to him Lord of the Sabbath. If we thought of Him thus and gave Him His place it would preserve us from any fear of breakdown. We see He has come in to put things right on our side. "Stretch out thy hand": every one of us knows to what extent we have done that. He stretched it out to the Lord, a withered hand, but draws it back restored, according to the virtue of Him to whom he stretched it out. The personal grace of the Lord is needed for appropriation. It is great grace on His part to be here, that in all our conscious inability to appropriate all that love has provided, we can stretch out our hand to be restored as we sit here. Do we believe it? We see the principle of it in @1 Timothy 1: 12 - 14. It is exactly what this man got. There was every kind of disability in Saul of Tarsus, he was in every way an unsuitable man. His hand was thoroughly dried, but he did really stretch it out to a Person who, as he says, "has given me power ... with faith and love, which is in Christ Jesus" (@1 Timothy 1: 12, 14). It is all on Paul's side. His hand was restored.
Ques. When did he first stretch forth his hand?
C.A.C. I think he stretched forth his hand at the end of @Romans 7 first, but there is a continual need for getting the virtue that is in Him, appropriating it that we may have strength to serve, as @1 Timothy 1: 13, "Appointed to ministry", that we may be able to appropriate all the wealth of divine good for strength for service and to be here for the will of God. Paul had to learn that all was dried on his side.
Rem. "Let the stealer steal no more" (@Ephesians 4: 28).
Rem. Seeing it will not do, we must do it.
{46}
C.A.C. "But the grace of our Lord surpassingly overabounded with faith and love". If we cannot say that, it is a pity. There is every defect on our side, but virtue in Christ has brought in faith and love on our side.
Ques. Is this man a sign (@Isaiah 8: 18)?
C.A.C. Yes, no doubt he took his place along with others in "the house" (verse 20). In this chapter following upon the synagogue, we have the sea, the mountain, and then the house, people sitting in a circle around Christ, all doing the will of God. The Lord wants to detach us from the synagogue and bring us to the house that we may sit in an orderly way around the Son of God, doing the will of God. We never do the will of God except as in our place in relation to the Son of God. The Lord goes into the synagogue, but He withdraws with His disciples to the sea (verse 7). In the synagogue there is, firstly, no sympathy and, secondly, antagonism. He leaves conditions like that. It was lawful to the Pharisees with the Herodians to destroy a man on the Sabbath, but not to heal one. Now we have to be prepared to withdraw from the synagogue where those are who profess to know God, but in works deny Him. Hardening (verse 5) and opposition (verse 6) develop into speaking injuriously against the Holy Spirit (verse 29). That is final. The withdrawal becomes the occasion of a wider service -- the sea: "a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea, and from Jerusalem ... and they of around Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, having heard what things he did, came to him" (verses 7, 8). It goes right out to the gentile world. We are not in a restricted sphere of service. In the synagogue the service is very much official, with appointed servants. Outside there is great liberty for service. "The sea" indicates a wide sphere of service, outside dried-up profession, and the Lord takes His disciples there. God is going to have Him honoured. There is very wide scope of service, but when you get out there you have to be careful that you do not come under the influence of those you serve; hence the "little ship". That is very important in connection with service. You have to influence
{47}
those you serve without in the slightest degree being influenced by those you serve. If you come under their influence it means being moulded in your service by the thoughts of man. Paul speaks of being Christ's bondman (@Galatians 1: 10), "not as pleasing men, but God" (@1 Thessalonians 2: 4). He always keeps in his "little ship".
Rem. One would be more effectual on that line, but not popular.
C.A.C. You must maintain separation from the influence of those you serve; otherwise you come under their influence. It is not monastic because it has in view the serving of a multitude. Servants get out of the "little ship" sometimes, but Peter and John in @Acts 3: 11, 12, and Paul and Barnabas at Lystra in @Acts 14: 11 - 18 would not allow themselves to fall under such influence. The Lord spoke to the disciples about the "little ship" (verse 9), so it is instruction for them and us. "And he goes up into the mountain, and calls whom he himself would". The "little ship" shows the separation, and "the mountain" the elevation in which the Lord would be served.
Ques. What is the thought of surnames?
C.A.C. It is the principle of sovereignty. He calls whom He Himself would and three of them are singled out and called to the peerage -- surnamed! They were distinctive personages amongst the apostles. We have to accept that it is no use quarrelling with it; the Lord calls to Him whom He Himself would to be with Him, in an elevation far above men. No one goes forth in spiritual dignity to serve but from there.
Rem. In @John 1 the two disciples ask Him, "Where abidest thou? ... and they abode with him". It is from that spot that Andrew goes out to find his own brother Simon, to evangelise.
C.A.C. It is all very beautiful. There is also the refusal of testimony from the unclean spirits; although their testimony was true. The Lord would not have it (verses 11, 12).
{48}
FROM C.A.C.¬S NOTES
@Mark 6: 1 - 46
Capernaum is where the Lord dwelt after leaving Nazareth when He heard that John was delivered up (@Matthew, 4: 13). It is "his own city" (@Matthew 9: 1). "His own country" in @Mark 6: 1 is probably Nazareth. It is very solemn and instructive that not one disciple, so far as we know, came from Nazareth in the days of the Lord's flesh. Not even His brethren believed on Him until resurrection. The Lord wondered because of their unbelief. Think of those thirty years! And now the teaching! It was such as to amaze (@Luke 4). And such works of power, referring perhaps to the chapter before: "Whatsoever we have heard" (@Luke 4: 23). The lowly grace of the incarnation is wonderful. They thought they knew all about Him, and His birth and kindred. Possibly Joseph was by this time dead, hence they say "the son of Mary". They cannot deny the wisdom or the power but they do not know the Person. The world cannot deny that there is something wonderful about Jesus, but they do not trace His origin to God.
Hence they can discuss Him and come to the conclusion that He is just one of themselves. They have not learned what Nicodemus knew -- that He was from God and God was with Him.
The great principle comes out as described by Jesus, that "A prophet is not despised save in his own country". What is the real import of this? The Lord accepts it as being the experience of all prophets -- a needed discipline for them but a solemn thing for those who are tested by having a prophet specially identified with them. It was not, with the Lord, that those who knew Him best had least reason to honour Him.
I often think we have to beware of this. The mind of God is familiar to us, we hear the truth more than others; the Lord is, as it were, continually moving in and out amongst us. So that we are in danger of losing the sense of God being in it.
{49}
What we see and hear every day as an ordinary thing is apt to lose its value. Such is man, even as highly favoured of God. What the Lord says is an important encouragement for us, for most of us have to serve in our own country or nearby. We cannot go to some place where people will honour us because we serve the mind of God. We have to serve where, if we speak at all for God, we may expect to be despised. They may not be able to deny that there is something that is not ordinary there, but they will be offended. It is the normal course of things here. The Lord, perfect in everything, accepts the limitations. He could not do any works of power there. Matthew adds, "because of their unbelief", but here it is the blessed Prophet recognising that works of power had their time and place, but He was under restraint in these conditions. Where people are offended in the word it is not suitable for works of power. But divine grace is never wholly shut up: He laid His hands on a few infirm persons and healed them. "Luke alone is with me" shows that the physician is there in 2 Timothy days and therefore healing. Luke's gospel is a healing medicine and balm.
But however much we may be limited locally we must not forget that the Lord's universal administration goes on and He maintains His testimony. "Two and two" would indicate the subdivision of things locally so that there is adequate power as sent. Where there is anything of assembly character, however feeble (for two is the smallest collective number), the Lord's power is with them, but on their side they must be careful not to weaken the power by having human resources. Divine support only -- a staff. No scrip, no bread, no money: absolute dependence and counting on the faithfulness of the One who sends. But they are to have sandals. Their walk is to be preserved in the character of those who are on a journey, not settling here, but nothing superfluous for the body.
I would enquire why the beheading of John is introduced at this point and in connection with the Lord's name becoming public, coming in, too, between the sending out of the
{50}
twelve and their return to Jesus. Herod's conscience was active; some might say Elias or a prophet, but to Herod it was John whom he had beheaded. Men are conscious that they are in hostility to God. Man is lawless and governed by his lusts even though he may do many things, and Satan gets man into his hands that way.
Jesus¬ name becoming public (verse 14) produces a certain activity of conscience in men. The public testimony of God does this because it calls attention to what is unlawful. The conscience takes sides with what is right, but lusts carry man away.
The apostles are gathered together to Jesus -- a model for all who serve. Relate to Him what you have done and taught: He calls them apart into a desert place. Public activities are apt to leave us no leisure to eat. When the servants rest there is an opportunity to see what God has done by them. There is no attraction there but what was spiritual. The great crowd represents those who have been affected by the ministry of the twelve.
There is an urgency about the Lord's action in verse 45, "He compelled his disciples to go on board ship". They were intended to have learned through the feeding of the five thousand what would have prepared them for their experience in the ship. "They understood not through the loaves: for their heart was hardened". If things take us by surprise we ought to consider whether we have not missed some precious lesson in the school of God.
"To go on before to the other side to Bethsaida". He had sent them out in service in verse 7 and they had come back. But now they are sent on before, the only occasion, I believe, when the disciples were sent away from Him, other than as sent out in service. What is the import of this?
The Lord sends the five thousand away satisfied. They go to carry the testimony of satisfaction. The One who had satisfied them sent them. It is really the close of Israel's day. A divine Person came in manhood to verify all the promises of God.
{51}
FELLOWSHIP AND SATISFACTION
@Mark 6: 30 - 44; @Mark 8: 1 - 9
C.A.C. My thought in suggesting these scriptures was that we might see that the fellowship which the Lord has set up in the desert is marked by complete satisfaction. I think it is an aspect of the fellowship that we do well to consider. The gathering together of the five thousand would seem to be morally connected with the ministry of the twelve. They had gone forth and had accomplished their service, and they came back to tell the Lord what they had done and taught, and the Lord withdrew them into a desert place to rest awhile; but it would appear that the mission of the twelve had the effect of gathering a great crowd together. It seems to me it is a picture of the result in this world of the testimony of the apostles. Their coming together gave occasion to the Lord to disclose what was in His own heart, and that is to have a company of persons in fellowship, for they were all caused to sit down and eat together, a figure of communion or fellowship in which everyone is marked by satisfaction. My impression is that it is a primary thought in connection with fellowship in the Lord's mind that all those who participate in it should be marked by complete satisfaction. It is a great proposal! That is what is in the Lord's heart and mind for all those who are drawn together by the power of His name as a result of the testimony of the apostles. I believe that is the impression that the Lord would give us this afternoon, that His thought is to introduce to our hearts elements of complete and divine satisfaction.
Bread is a figure of Christ as having come down from heaven in order to be satisfaction for human hearts, and in the crowd eating of it together there is also the thought of communion or fellowship, showing that the Lord's intention is that there should be a multitude in the desert who so enter into what is come down from heaven in the person of Christ
{52}
that they are restful and satisfied. I believe that satisfaction is really what marks the fellowship. It is a great thought in the heart of God.
Ques. I suppose we arrive at this by recognising who the Lord is?
C.A.C. Yes, and it seems tome that the converse is true; that is, that we learn who the Lord is, how great He is, by what He can do for us. If the Lord is great enough to set up a large company of persons in this desert world in complete satisfaction, and in communion with one another in that satisfaction, it is a great testimony to this world. It is not only the fellowship; it is the testimony. A company like that is the testimony here to the greatness of Christ. So that the Lord refers them to the miracle of the loaves (chapter 8: 17 - 21). He reminds them of the five loaves, of the seven loaves and of the abundance, the surplus that there was. It was only because their hearts were hardened that they did not at once perceive how great He was. I believe the Lord would put that impression upon our hearts today, that He is equal to everything. This is not just a matter of theory; it is for us individually and collectively to prove it to be a reality. There is not much testimony in our talk about being satisfied, if, after all, we are unsatisfied. Satisfaction is the result of getting the good of the Lord's service.
Ques. Would you consider that however small a company may be, there is no reason why they should not know the Lord in such sufficiency that all are satisfied?
C.A.C. I think the Lord in causing them to sit down by hundreds and by fifties intimates to us His pleasure that His saints should sit down together in relatively small numbers.
The whole of the fellowship represented by the five thousand was under His eye, but He signified His pleasure that we should sit down in relatively small numbers, and then we should find Him acting in such a way that there is complete satisfaction for all.
Rem. Some suggest that our readings are dry.
{53}
C.A.C. That is a fine opportunity for them to be like Gideon's fleece, full of the dew of heaven while all around is dry!
The incident of the five thousand brings out the weakness that exists on our side. The second feeding of the multitude is altogether different. It is a matter there of spiritual persons who are characterised by spiritual elements, but in chapter 6 it is a company of persons marked by conditions of weakness, as sheep having no shepherd; even the disciples have only five loaves. The number five in this connection evidently intimates a small supply. The disciples, you might say, were in despair; the resources available were so small (see @Luke 9: 13). The Lord would give us the sense that things are small; I do not think we shall get His grace and power if we do not feel that things are small, but He would not leave us there. It is really a desert place. There are no resources to be found in the world to give satisfaction. Momentary gratification may be found there, but not satisfaction. In our own circle there may not appear to be much available, but the Lord would show us how unlimited is His power to multiply what is of Himself and to make it adequate for complete satisfaction. He would not leave us under a depressing sense that the resources are inadequate. The devil would like us to think that they are.
Ques. What is the suggestion of the green grass?
C.A.C. I think it intimates the favourable conditions which the Lord would provide for His people: for instance, I regard such a meeting as this as a manifestation of favourable conditions. We can come together in our own company unmolested, and can be in quietness. The normal conditions in which the saints come together are marked by what is favourable and what ministers to comfort. There is a difference between that and the circumstances in chapter 8, where there is no grass, and where they sat down on the ground. It needs spiritual persons to do that, and be happy.
Ques. What are the barley loaves?
{54}
C.A.C. It is mentioned in @John 6 that the loaves were barley loaves, and I think that would carry with it the thought of resurrection. In a general way, bread signifies the Lord as having come down from heaven, bringing all that is of God and heaven's grace near to us, so that it may be available for the satisfaction of our hearts. But then the additional thought of barley would carry things on to resurrection, that all that came down from heaven in the Person of the Lord Jesus has been carried through into resurrection. The whole of God's faithful grace as witnessed in Christ is now carried through into eternal conditions. It is all secured in resurrection. So that the faithfulness of God, all that God delights to be for men, is set forth in Christ and is now carried into the permanent condition of resurrection.
Ques. What is your thought about the elements of satisfaction?
C.A.C. Well, what comes out of heaven has that character. The desert is a place where there is no satisfaction, and that is the character of the scene in which we are found outwardly. But then, God having brought in Christ, we have been singing with joy that He has engaged our hearts with Christ, and in doing that He has engaged us with that which has every element of satisfaction in it.
Rem. The real testimony would be that satisfaction.
C.A.C. That is the testimony. One of the primary and essential features of the testimony is the evidence that God is able to satisfy a people in this world without their needing a single particle of the world to contribute to it. That is a great testimony! Are we all set to go in to prove it?
'Five' speaks of such an apprehension of Christ as might be found in those who are small in stature. It is "a little boy" (@John 6: 9) who had the five loaves. I do not think a little boy would ever have seven loaves. That makes it suit some of us very well, who feel that we are not very great in stature spiritually, and that we have a small and restricted apprehension of Christ. The apprehension of Christ is limited. I do not
{55}
know how others feel, but that has often been pressed home on my spirit. But the Lord would use the very sense of our own smallness spiritually to cast us upon Himself, and He would show that all His grace and power is available to multiply the little apprehension of Him that we have, so that it shall become great enough to result in complete satisfaction for ourselves and for all those who are in the fellowship. The grace of the Lord in meeting small conditions comes out in chapter 6; His greatness in filling up spiritual conditions comes out in chapter 8. In chapter 6 it is His grace. His condescending gentleness and grace, in coming down to small and limited conditions and giving them such expansion that there is no lack. It is the testimony to His greatness that He can do it.
This is the character of the fellowship in which we are found in the desert. In all the circumstances of the world we are left to be witnesses of the greatness of Christ, because He has brought us a satisfaction in Himself that has made us independent of everything that is in the world. I do not think the fellowship means much if it is not a fellowship in divine satisfaction. Bread is for the sustainment of life, and life without satisfaction is far short of God's thought of life. The element of satisfaction was evident at Pentecost, and it is a vital thing in the fellowship, though we often overlook it. We have such doctrinal ideas about fellowship. People talk and discuss it from all points of view, but we want to get to the vitality of the fellowship. Why are we heart to heart and shoulder to shoulder? Because we have been introduced into such a personal acquisition of Christ as the great expression of God's faithfulness that we are satisfied, and we are separate from the world because we are satisfied without it. It is a marked contrast with what obtains in the world; even those who have desires after Christ produced by the ministry of the twelve are often as sheep having no shepherd. There is a crowd today who have been affected by the ministry of the apostles and have desires after Christ, but they are as sheep
{56}
having no shepherd, and it is obvious to an onlooker that they have no satisfaction. In contrast to all that, the Lord is setting up a fellowship marked by satisfaction; it says, "They all ate and were satisfied". Then He could trust them; He could dismiss them to go into their various spheres to bear witness to the wonderful character of the Person they had been in contact with.
Ques. What about the two fishes?
C.A.C. I think that the loaves represent what is available in Christ, but I do not know that fishes are ever typical of Christ. They are typical of the saints as taken out of the world for God. Fishes that can be eaten have been taken out of their natural element. They are fish out of water! That is exactly the right character for a saint to have. He has been taken completely out of his natural element, but he has been taken out of it to be for God. And these fish were undoubtedly cooked. The Lord would never have given people raw fish. They had come under the action of fire, which is most important if we are to be palatable. Everyone knows the difference between a raw fish and a cooked one, and the Lord uses cooked fish. When He made a dinner for them there was a fire of coals and fish laid thereon (@John 21). The fish represent that element of the fellowship which has to do with the moral state of the saints, and that is as important in its place as the bread. Speaking in figure, we may say that if the two fishes had not been there the loaves would not have been available for the people. We cannot have the satisfaction of what is in Christ apart from certain moral conditions brought about in ourselves. The two fishes represent adequate testimony to that.
Ques. Why is fish given to the Lord in @Luke 24?
C.A.C. The fish there is in a form that is palatable even to the risen Lord. He partook of it. But even there it is a partial thought; it is "part of a broiled fish". The two small fishes show that the thought connected with the fishes is not a predominant one. Things are, so to speak, small on that side,
{57}
but they are real, small but real. And the Lord cannot dispense with that. However small it is it must be real. We do not read of "great" fishes until the millennium as typified in @John 21.
The fishes which the Lord would make food for us are fishes that have been under the action of fire. When we were converted God took us out of the whole sphere in which we lived. In that sense we are fish out of water. And we should always remember that divine grace has taken us completely out of our former element. The same grace has brought us under a process of self-judgment which answers to the cooking of the fish, a process by which we learn to judge all that is of the flesh in ourselves, and that is an essential feature of the fellowship of the assembly. The bread without the fishes would not constitute a fellowship that is according to God, and I should dread an increased ministry of Christ if it were not accompanied by intense separation from the world and deepened self-judgment. It would ever have these accompaniments according to God. We do not want to make exceedingly prominent, in the testimony, the separation of the saints and their self-judgment, but if it is not there there is nothing. The ministry would be ineffective if not accompanied by separation and self-judgment. It would nullify all that is in the loaves if we had not the fishes. One reason why many believers are not satisfied is that they have not taken the place of being fish out of water. They have not taken the place of having done with all the conditions of their former lives.
Ques. Do you mean that we must be taken out of the world, and then sent back into it?
C.A.C. It comes to that ultimately. But the fishes are seen here as representing an essential feature of the satisfaction that pertains to the fellowship. The real reason why there is not more satisfaction is that there it not a clean cut from the world. Moses left Egypt. The Spirit of God has told us that by faith he forsook Egypt. The whole thing was a
{58}
judged system to him, and he forsook it; there was a definite moment in his history when he forsook Egypt.
Ques. Is there such a thing as collective self-judgment?
C.A.C. There is such a thing as assembly repentance; the apostle was seeking to bring it about at Corinth; those exercises belong to us collectively as well as individually. The object before the apostle in writing to the Corinthians was that the company should be marked by self-judgment so that they might be a new lump as unleavened. They actually were that in the thought of God, but He would have it to be practically so.
Self-judgment is infectious if taken up before God. If one judges what is wrong, it is a help to others. In the fellowship we find no influences at work but what are of God. Whether it be self-judgment or appreciation of Christ, we find them in our brethren, and thus they are promoted in ourselves. These things are most important if the fellowship and the testimony are to be a reality. We do not want anything in the fellowship that savours of current religion.
It is important for us to link together the thought of the five loaves and the seven and the one. We read about one loaf in chapter 8. The one loaf is figurative of Christ in His exclusive power. So that there is no room for the leaven of the Pharisees, which is the religious side, or the leaven of Herod, which is the worldly side, or the infidel element of the Sadducees. If we have Christ as the one loaf He is exclusive of all those elements. Having learned what He can be as the five loaves and the seven prepares us to understand His divine pre-eminent exclusiveness as the one loaf. He shuts out all other elements and the ground is cleared for assembly formation.
Ques. How is collective self-judgment brought about?
C.A.C. I think that collective self-judgment is sought to be brought about by the Lord's appeal to the assemblies in @Revelation 2 and 3. He appeals to the assemblies as represented by the angels, and in five of His addresses there is a
{59}
distinct call to assembly repentance. As we know, the assembly as such never repented and therefore it becomes the responsibility of the individual to do what the assembly will not do. The overcomer is marked by repentance and by the appreciation of Christ, and therefore he rises superior to all the influences that have called for the Lord's rebuke. I think assembly repentance is of the greatest importance where there is need for it. I believe that there is often need for it. If saints profess to be walking in the light of the assembly and they do things in a way that the Lord does not approve, there will be no restoration for them unless they repent. The Lord will not let anything pass. If we are near the Lord in any measure He will not let things pass. He allows many things to pass in the current religious world, but He will not allow things to pass with those who are nearer to Him. I have known occasions when saints have had to judge actions that took place twenty or thirty years ago. Saints will never be right as to assembly character unless they judge what the Lord does not approve. If we have done what is wrong, it must be judged.
Ques. What is the difference between giving thanks and blessing?
C.A.C. In connection with the five loaves it is the Lord's coming in grace to magnify and to multiply what is very weak and feeble on our side; He comes in in grace; He comes in, so to speak, on God's part, in His grace to multiply any little that we have that is of Christ. My comfort is that if I have a little bit that is of Christ He can multiply it. If we have a little bit of Christ and put that in His hand He can multiply it so that the whole fellowship is benefited. That is connected with blessing.
In connection with the seven loaves He gave thanks. That is headship. There are conditions which allow the Lord to take His place in headship, and wherever those conditions are found He will do it. The Lord loves to take His place as Head, but it requires spiritual conditions. In chapter 8 there
{60}
are no conditions of weakness. All the conditions are marked by spirituality. There is no crowd like sheep having no shepherd. They were three days in the company of Christ, a spiritual company. None but a spiritual company could be held in the company of Christ for three days without expressing a single desire for anything natural. Amongst such a company as that the Lord can suggest. Everything is suggested by the Lord in chapter 8. The need is suggested by the disciples in chapter 6 and in lordship He meets it, but in chapter 8 the suggesting is all from the Lord. Chapter 8 links with Colossians, and therefore you have elements now that are universal in character. There is no sitting down in companies; the whole four thousand is in view. Four is the number of universality. All that is spiritual is universal in character.
Ques. Why does the Lord bless the fishes in chapter 8?
C.A.C. Because when we think of our side there is always the need for His blessing. But His giving thanks for the loaves confirms the thought that headship is in view here. If we have known what it was to be with Him for three days that would carry us to resurrection. And amongst saints who are risen with Him He takes a place on our side in headship. The Lord can take His place along with spiritual persons, and voice their thanksgiving. This brings us in picture -- a spiritual picture -- to the saints viewed as risen with Christ: Colossian ground. Three days speak of resurrection. When we come to that ground we are universal in our affections, so that as regards the Colossians and Ephesians, Paul thanks God because he has heard of their love to all the saints. Love cannot be limited to what is local.
In chapter 7 the Lord exposes what is in the heart of man. Then a poor Gentile comes up having learned the blessed character of what is in the heart of God, and then we have the Lord doing all things well; He makes the deaf to hear and the speechless to speak. It is on that line that spirituality is reached, and we see, in figure, a company marked by
{61}
spiritual features in chapter 8. 1 hope we covet to walk together as having spiritual features, so that we may have seven loaves.
Ques. What are spiritual features?
C.A.C. I think they are such features as Paul and Epaphras laboured to bring about in Colosse. They laboured and agonised that the gentile saints should be marked by spiritual features, that they should stand perfect and complete in all the will of God. A spiritual person is one who has nothing less before him than the whole precious thought of God in connection with Christ and the assembly.
When we come to the spiritual sphere we get outside what is local, just as we do in the morning meeting. We are local up to the time of the breaking of bread, but then if we pass on to give Christ His place as Head we are outside locality and time in the universal and eternal sphere of spiritual privilege.
Ques. What about their being dismissed?
C.A.C. The dismissal intimates that permanent conditions are not yet reached. All the satisfaction and the moral conditions which we have been speaking of are provisional. We take up things locally in the light of what is universal. It would not be right to do anything here in N. that it would not be right to do anywhere else. But when we get into the true spiritual privilege of the assembly we get outside what is local, and we think of the whole company of saints as in the mind of God, united together as one body and increasing with the increase of God. Every member is nourished and ministered to, by what comes from the Head, showing how great Christ is: He is great enough to do that. Many true saints may not understand it, but the point is, do I understand it? Is Christ in my estimation great enough to fill with satisfaction the whole company of saints upon earth?
The satisfaction in chapter 6 stands in relation to all the need of our hearts. We have certain needs, and they are all met in gracious power; but the satisfaction of chapter 8 is
{62}
connected with the fruition of all that is in the heart and mind of God. All is from Christ's side; He makes suggestions, and as spiritual persons we look for satisfaction in what is of Him; we are not dependent upon green grass. As fed under the headship of Christ we are independent of favourable conditions here. The Lord would use all the testing exercises that come upon us as we walk together to intensify our appreciation of what is spiritual. The hard ground often ministers more to spirituality than the green grass. If He calls us to go through conflict and exercise, the bearing of burdens and the enduring of sorrow, that is lying on the hard ground. And the Lord may make the hard ground much more blessed for us than the green grass. He can use even that to cast our hearts back upon Himself, upon the heart of God and upon all that is spiritual. Thus we may have profound satisfaction even though we are lying on the ground.
The surplus gathered up in the baskets indicates that the thought of satisfaction is not to terminate with the present assembly period. Enough will be left over to be administered in a wider sphere in a coming day. The twelve baskets of chapter 6 speak of this, while the seven larger baskets of chapter 8 suggest that there will be not only completeness in administration so that every need is met, but the spiritual perfection and fulness of God's thoughts as secured in Christ will be the satisfaction of those who know Him. But no new elements of satisfaction will be added to those which are available now. This brings out in a wonderful way the wealth of resources which is provided for our satisfaction at the present time. It is good to think of the christian fellowship in this blessed feature of it, that it is a participation in common in that which is wholly of God, and which affords complete satisfaction. May we know more what it is to have the good of it.
{63}
SPIRITUAL FOOD
@Mark 6: 34 - 52
The lessons connected with the five loaves and the seven and the one are most important. In each case it is a question of what the disciples have which can be made available for food. Have we got anything which the Lord can multiply? There are things which melt away to nothing if the Lord touches them, but there are other things which He can multiply to any extent. These are the things which His disciples are possessed of: in one word, as they are possessed of Christ.
The outlook of the Lord upon His people today must be much what it was in verse 34. He would "teach them many things" and he would have them fed. In view of the widespread need He would say to us today, "How many loaves have ye? Go and see". Have we got anything which will feed men's souls? I think we shall find that we have. They had five loaves. Five is what may be called the human number: man has five fingers on each hand, five toes on each foot, and five senses. It speaks of what man is as a creature in dependent weakness which has become intensified by the fallen condition in which he is found. And it speaks of the grace of God in Christ to meet all human need. The disciples were conversant with the Old Testament, and they knew that God had pledged Himself in hundreds of promises to meet all the need of Israel. They had Christ in their thoughts as the One in whom all those promises were verified and fulfilled. I believe the five loaves represent that. It was to be known, and will be known, in Israel.
The two fishes represent the testimony that was there to men being secured for the pleasure of God. We know from @John 6 that they were "small fishes", but still it was there in testimony. If a divine thought is maintained even in the
{64}
smallest way it is something which can be divinely multiplied. Its value reaches, or may reach, the whole of the people of God. We are privileged to hold and maintain it for all saints.
Whatever promises of God there are, in Christ is the yea and amen of them all.
The disciples "understood not through the loaves: for their heart was hardened". How we need to be preserved from that hardness of heart that does not understand! If our hearts are hardened they get narrowed down to human thoughts, natural thoughts. It is a great thing to have hearts that are soft and impressionable spiritually, so that we understand the greatness of the Person with whom we have to do, and what He can do. Perhaps each one of us has enough of Christ to feed thousands of His saints if it came under His hand. It is a question of the sufficiency of Christ.
Then in chapter 7: 27 we find that the children of the kingdom had forfeited all title to the promises. They were hypocrites, with their heart far from God, and making His word void, their heart a fountain of wickedness. The Lord exposes all this, but He also brings to light the work of God in one who had no title to anything on the line of promise (verse 28). It was just to her what God was in Himself in His infinite goodness. This lay behind all the promises. Whether man has any title to promise or not, God is what He is, and I think the seven loaves are connected with this (chapter 8: 2, 5). It is not promises, but God Himself come forth to bless in the revelation of what He is. It is not here a crowd who are as sheep having no shepherd, but who have been with Christ three days. Such need food that they may return from spiritual privilege strengthened for the responsible life, so that there is no fainting on the way. A young woman said, 'I think I should be perfectly happy if I could always remain in the meetings, but when I have to go home I get tested and I break down'. You need the seven loaves to meet that -- to know that God is for you, Christ is for you, and the Holy Spirit is for you. That is perfection of resource to keep you
{65}
up to the level of the spiritual privilege you have enjoyed. Your strength lies in appropriating what is available for you in divine Persons. 'The fulness of our God alone, the measure is of grace divine'.
{66}
THE FIVE LOAVES, THE SEVEN AND THE ONE (1)
@Mark 8: 5, 14, 19 - 21
I would like to gather some spiritual instruction from the references in Mark to five loaves and seven and one, seeing that they are linked together by the Lord's words in verses 19 - 21. There is something in common between the incidents or they would not be thus linked.
The gathering of the five thousand in @Mark 6 comes after the mission of the twelve, and it would prefigure the result of the administration of grace by means of the apostles. It was a very extended result, and it gave occasion to the Lord to disclose what was in His mind. He would shepherd them, and do it in such a way that every one in that great crowd would be satisfied (verse 42). It was a striking picture of the communion or fellowship that He would set up in the desert of this world. A primary thought of the assembly is that under the shepherd care of Christ everyone is fed and satisfied. Companies and ranks by hundreds and by fifties would show that the Lord has pleasure in comparatively small numbers of His saints sitting down together. The Lord, we might venture to say, undertakes all for us if we follow His directions.
The disciples knew that the crowd had not anything to eat, but they had to learn that it was intended by the Lord that *they* should give them to eat, and that they had sufficient to do so. It is well to "Go and see" what we have. The disciples had Christ; they had gone forth as His personal representatives; they knew the power of the kingdom as present in grace.
I think it may be said that bread represents Christ as incarnate having come down out of heaven (@John 6). "This is my body" would confirm this. But five loaves or seven would suggest that as apprehended by men, there are different
{67}
measures which give character to the communion which may be enjoyed together. 'Five' would appear to refer to the grace of heaven as it may be apprehended by those who have not much stature: it was "a little boy" who had the five loaves. But 'seven' would indicate a spiritual completeness such as would pertain to those mature, full-grown in Christ. 'One' loaf would be exclusive of all others so that no fleshly religious or worldly element is to be admitted into our communion.
Then why do fish go with bread here and in @John 21? They do not seem to be figurative in Scripture of Christ, but of men as those who can be caught for God. The communion of saints cannot be according to God if this element is wanting. It is not a preponderating thought for we know that in the feeding of the crowds the fishes were "small ones". I do not think we get the thought of "great fishes" until @John 21 where the great result in the millennial day is typified. But the communion of saints is not possible without the recognition that men are secured for God. There is adequate testimony to this, though it may be outwardly small.
The Lord's asking, "How many loaves have ye?" on each occasion shows that He attached importance to the number. The real lesson of each occasion was bound up in the number. In the first instance the Lord is calling attention to the fact that He commits to His disciples responsibility to furnish material for the communion and satisfaction of all those who are attracted to Him. But at the same time He brings to light that what they have is very inadequate for the occasion. In the other three gospels they remark on the smallness of the supply. This would evidently be the import of the number 'five', at any rate in this connection. The Lord would make us conscious that what we have of Himself is limited. We have all felt that, I am sure, and never do we feel it more than when the Lord puts responsibility upon us to minister to the communion or satisfaction of those who have been drawn to Him out of a scene which could give them
{68}
nothing. But then He would give us the consciousness that He intends to use us to bring about the communion and satisfaction of His people. I take it that one very important and precious mark of the fellowship is satisfaction. Those who are attracted to Christ are caused by Him to sit down by companies in favourable circumstances "on the green grass" that they may eat and be satisfied. Let us never forget that this is a feature of the testimony which is of great importance. In the midst of a desert scene, where so many thousands even of true believers are as sheep not having a shepherd, He would have His people to sit down in companies, and to be so fed as to be fully satisfied. This is the Lord's intent, and He knows well, in forming this intent, how small things are on our side. He will use what is of Himself in our souls, and every divine feature, however small it may be. Thank God, there is something here which our Lord Jesus can connect with heaven, and with all the grace of heaven, and which He can bless. There is nothing of Christ amongst His disciples that He would not multiply so that it should become the common portion and satisfaction of all who sit down in companies. This is the fellowship, and it is also the testimony.
It is good to have that which He can take up and use and multiply. Whatever is of Christ, even if it be weak and small, can be multiplied under His hand, so that it becomes a common portion for His saints and tends to their satisfaction.
But for this there must be a testimony to the fact that the saints are taken out of the world to be for God, and that they have come under the action of fire. Everyone knows the difference between a raw fish and a cooked one. The evidence of self-judgment and of separation from the world are as essential to the communion as the joint-partaking of Christ. Indeed we cannot have the one without the other. One would dread an increased ministry of Christ if it were not accompanied by the evidence of intensified separation from the world and deepened self-judgment.
{69}
THE FIVE LOAVES, THE SEVEN AND THE ONE (2)
@Mark 8: 14 - 21
I believe the Lord would raise an exercise with us as to what we have got which He can multiply and make available as food for His people. It is a poor thing to have that which makes a show before men, but which the Lord cannot multiply -- that which shrinks into nothingness when He touches it. Laodicea makes a great boast of resources, but there is nothing there which the Lord can multiply: there is nothing for Him.
One cannot doubt that there is much instruction for us in what is conveyed by the disciples having five loaves on one occasion, seven on another, and then one. These occasions tested the perception and understanding of the disciples, and I think I may say they test our perception and understanding. It is a question of how we have learned Christ, of how we have become possessed of Him, for He alone is Bread for men. If you have an apprehension of Christ, the Lord can multiply that to any extent, and make it food for all His people. You may say, it is a very small apprehension, but the Lord would give you perception and understanding of how great what you apprehend really is. It is so great in relation to God that it is more than equal to supply all need. There is that in it which can be magnified and multiplied to any extent. I think the Lord would encourage us to take spiritual account of what we have, and to see what expansion it is capable of under His hand. I take it that we have all learned something spiritually of Christ; we have become possessed of Him. Now if we place that at the Lord's disposal He can so multiply it that it becomes food for every one of His needy people who comes within our reach. He can make it reach out in strengthening grace to thousands! You may be feeling
{70}
how little you have; the Lord would give you an impression of how great it is in His estimation, and of how He can bring out its greatness and astonish you by the capabilities that are in it.
What we find in the first incident is that the Lord's compassion is drawn out to a greater crowd "because they were as sheep not having a shepherd". That is, they needed care.
They seem to be rather contrasted with the many coming and going in chapter 6: 31, who were only a distraction, depriving the disciples of leisure even to eat. But these are seen of the Lord as subjects of compassion and as calling His shepherd care into exercise. I am sure there is a great crowd of this kind today. How many of His people are truly in this condition! A flock of sheep would always interest a true shepherd, and if he saw they lacked care and food it would move his heart. Now, are we looking upon the sheep of the flock of God with something of the shepherd solicitude that is in the heart of Christ? We speak of having part with Him. May it not be an empty word with us!
He would teach them many things. "He began to teach them". It was in the exercise of His shepherd care: that is the kind of teaching the sheep need. You may be sure that every word of that teaching was marked by consideration for their true need, and by that which would help them spiritually in relation to God whose sheep they were. For a true shepherd would always have before him not only the sheep but the interests of their owner. The sheep are to be tended so that their owner may have full gain and pleasure in them.
It is humbling to find throughout the gospels that the disciples more often appear in contrast with the Lord than in concert with Him -- humbling because it is a true picture of how we are so often found ourselves. Here they would have the people sent away to buy themselves bread but this was not His thought: "Give ye them to eat". The disciples had what sufficed because they had what He could multiply. And I venture to say we have sufficient to feed the whole
{71}
flock today if we placed it, as it were, under His hand for multiplication.
I regard the five loaves as representing the apprehension which the disciples had, that He was the Christ as come in on the line of the promises to Israel. He was to them Israel's Messiah to bring in the kingdom of God. They had learned Him, believed on Him, and were following Him as having the faith of this. He had come in to meet all the need of Israel, to verify in Himself every promise of God in the Old Testament, the need only serving to show the resources and power that were in Him, and the true character of the kingdom of God. He was Zion's provision abundantly blessed. To send the people away was to confess that He was not sufficient; that they must care for themselves. The disciples had five loaves: they had in figure an apprehension of Christ, but they had to learn how great He was in His availability for the flock of God, and how He could multiply what they had.
Now have not we five loaves? Are we not, through grace, possessed of this, that we know Christ as the perfect answer in grace to all the weakness and need of men? As need arose, God met it by promise, but when the time was fulfilled He brought in the verification of every promise in the Person of Christ. Have we not got the faith of that? Do we not know that all the wealth of God's kingdom came here in grace to men in Christ? You may say, our apprehension is weak. Yes, 'five' speaks of that, but however weak the apprehension, the thing apprehended has infinite potentialities. Put it at the Lord's disposal and He will show you the boundless possibilities that are there. It is just what the flock of God needs today.
When we come to the seven loaves we get a distinct advance upon the five. There is an important spiritual education in chapter 7 which I think would have the effect of giving us an apprehension of Christ answering to the seven loaves of chapter 8: 5. That is, the heart of man, even under the greatest outward show of purity, is seen exposed in the light
{72}
of God as a fountain of impurity. But then we see another thing. The Lord uncovers the working of God in a Syrophenician woman by which she goes behind all the promises and counts directly upon what God is in Himself. It seems to me that when we come to learn what God is in His nature, in His ineffable goodness that cannot be other than what it is, no matter what men may be or whether they have any claim on the ground of promise or not, we come to an apprehension that is indicated by the number 'seven'. It is perfection as known in its blessed Source in God Himself.
Then the incident at the end of chapter 7 presents the skill of Christ in dealing with man in respect to both his hearing and his speech. How wonderful to hear in such a way and to speak in such a way that it just becomes the evidence of the skill of Christ! This again would link itself in my mind with the number seven.
Now the crowd in chapter 8 calls out the Lord's compassion "because they have stayed with me already three days and they have not anything they can eat".
Before pursuing this subject further I feel constrained to seek light from God as to why in Luke and John we have the 'five' and not the 'seven', while Matthew and Mark give the 'seven' also? Would it connect with Matthew being the assembly gospel, as comes out in chapter 16, and with Mark showing full competency for service in the universal sphere indicated by the four thousand? Whereas in Luke it would be the ministry of divine grace to men as in local companies "by fifties".
In Matthew there are no *companies* in connection with the five thousand or the seven thousand: it is universal.
In Mark He orders the disciples in the case of the five thousand "to make them all sit down by companies on the green grass. And they sat down in ranks by hundreds and by fifties" (@Mark 6: 39, 40). But when we come to chapter 8 -- the seven loaves -- it is the crowd, four thousand, regarded universally.
{73}
In John the men are simply made to sit down, and we are told there was much grass in the place: there are no companies. It is really a figure of what is given "out of heaven" perfectly suited in grace to men as in dearth and death, but given out of heaven that men might eat and not die. It is God considering for men, and bringing in from heaven just what men need, that they may live in relation to Him.
In Matthew and Mark the Lord is educating His disciples to take the place of Israel as the light of the world, and as maintaining His service and testimony here. To this end He was giving them a knowledge of God in His goodness, and of His infinitely perfect service, that gave them a sense of perfection in One who had the heart of a Father, and in One, too, who was the Father's delight in manhood. They were learning perfection in an altogether new way, so as to be competent to feed men with it. Not only that all men's need can be met but it is met out of the perfection that is in divine Persons. God would set up in the place of Israel a witness to Himself in those who know Him through Jesus His beloved Son. I think the seven loaves would speak not only of every promise fulfilled but of God known in His own perfection as giving character to the new order and testimony that was coming in. Matthew and Mark are educational, to show how the line of promise is confirmed and established in Christ, but to lead on to the line of revelation and to the new order and testimony that was about to take the place of Israel. Luke and John give us the development of what is connected with revelation, both in relation to every question connected with man's responsibility and his having a wholly new place with God and in God's house as in Christ, and in relation to life and family relationships.
In the ship there is no question of storm or toil on their part. The Lord is with them: they have one loaf in the ship. The only exercise in this connection is that no element should be admitted other than what was there. This is a very important exercise. In one sense it covers the whole exercise of the
{74}
testimony. To perceive and understand the import of the loaves and to beware of foreign and injurious elements cover the whole exercise of those who are passing over, in isolation from the world, to the other side.
Here it is the exclusiveness of Christ; hence the one loaf. It is not His widely extended availability for man's hunger, but the exclusiveness which makes Him the only One, and which involves the greatest care that nothing else should come in.
Here it is the leaven of the Pharisees and of Herod. The Sadducee does not come in here. It is religiousness or the world in its profane or political character. I have no doubt that in view of service these are the two great snares. The Sadducee would come in in Matthew because there it is a question of how your thoughts of Christ are formed, but in service the danger is that you go on the line of the religious man, assuming a sanctity that is not real, or you descend to the level of the world to avoid reproach and secure their approbation.
{75}
FROM C.A.C.¬S NOTES
@Mark 8: 27 - 38; @Mark 9: 1 - 6
Caesarea-Philippi was the farthest point from Jerusalem which was reached by the Lord, about the same distance as Tyre and Sidon; it was beyond the Jordan. It is noticeable that at that point He raises the question of who He was. Every other question is of little account compared with that. All that has gone before in the gospel is to prepare us to answer it, "Who do men say that I am?" The thoughts expressed are not thoughts of enmity, but they all fall immeasurably short of the truth. "But ye, who do ye say that I am?" "Thou art the Christ". The men were blind; they had no vision in a divine sense. Men cannot rise above men: they may have good thoughts of Jesus, but human thoughts. Peter had really come under the hands of the Lord and had some vision: I do not say he saw all things clearly yet, but he had had the spit upon his eyes and the hands of Jesus upon him. It is not presented here as by the Father's revelation, as in Matthew; it is here rather the result of Christ's service, applying the virtue of His own Person to the disciples so that they got the power to see from Christ Himself. In Luke this question comes in in immediate connection with Jesus being alone praying. Saul said, "Who art thou, Lord?" (@Acts 9: 5). How He would love to answer that question!
He was the One on whom God had put His anointing. "With my holy oil have I anointed him" (@Psalm 89: 20). "Anointed ... with the oil of gladness" (@Psalm 45: 7). "Messiah, the Prince" (@Daniel 9: 25). We know that people were looking for Messiah (@John 1, 4, 11); Herod and others. The disciples recognised Him, but they were not to tell any man of Him. He began to teach them about His sufferings and death and resurrection. The Messiah was to be cut off and have nothing. Peter rebuked Him, missing all that was in the mind of God at that moment.
{76}
Then He calls the crowd with His disciples; this is something for all to hear, "Whoever desires to come after me" (verse 34); He presents Himself as leading the way. There is but that one way in the waste, which His footsteps have marked as His own; that path always demands the denial of self; that is not self-denial as men speak, but a refusal at some cost of one's natural thoughts and feelings. Indeed "himself" (verse 34) would cover everything that is not Christ. It is moving away from oneself after Christ; it is a daily and hourly experience.
Then taking up his cross is the public position. A man bearing his cross was going to execution; he is not expecting any place or honour here, the honour lies in following Christ. It is a path through the waste of this world, a path of divine light and certainty amid the darkness here.
If we desire to save our lives we shall lose them. How much there is in this to ponder! Christ and the gospel are the two great motives, but if they govern us it will mean in some sense losing our lives, but in a real and true sense saving them. That is, the life which can be viewed apart from Christ and the gospel is not a thing that we should desire to save.
On that line it will assuredly be lost. But if Christ and the gospel make us willing to lose our lives we shall save them.
Our lives become valuable. Human life becomes worth something when it is influenced by Christ and the gospel. To gain the whole world and to have nothing of value in the soul is very unprofitable. There is nothing we should value more than our souls. Have I saved my soul today? The Lord and His words are to be valued above all else: there is purity there in the midst of an adulterous and sinful generation. We see what a solemn thing it is to be ashamed of Christ and His words. The Son of man will come in the glory of His Father.
In Luke it is a threefold glory -- of the Son of man and of the Father and of the holy angels. Here it is the glory of His Father with the holy angels: the glory is that of the Father.
He will come invested with the glory of His Father, with the holy angels; that is, He will identify Himself with other
{77}
beings who serve in a holy way the Father's glory. It is "with his angels" in Matthew and Mark. In Luke it is first, "his own glory", then that of the Father, and then that of the holy angels. What a glory belongs to the Son of man! Man is truly glorious in Him, glorifying God in every way. So the glory of the Father invests Him -- divine glory of God in revelation. And thirdly, that of the holy angels: that is, unfallen creation is going to bring in its own peculiar glory to adorn the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ.
The Lord's announcement in @Mark 9: 1 following upon the confession of Him as the Christ, and upon His speaking of His sufferings and death, was a most gracious encouragement to the faith of His disciples. Some of them would not taste death until they should have seen the kingdom of God come in power. It would be seen by mortal eyes in its essential power. They had known and confessed Him as in humiliation; they would be permitted to see the kingdom in its power. This does not come at the beginning of the Lord's ministry, but towards the end. That is, they were morally instructed first to know and appreciate Him, and then they were allowed to be eye-witnesses of His majesty. The kingdom in its power actually came, not exactly down into the world, but "on a high mountain by themselves apart". They were taken up, something like John being set on a great and high mountain to see the holy city. What an elevation to be brought to, "the holy mountain" as Peter calls it! "His foundation" -- what He has founded -- "is in the mountains of holiness" (@Psalm 87: 1). We read in the Old Testament of the "mount of Jehovah" (@Genesis 22: 14), "the mountain of God" (@Exodus 3: 1; @Exodus 4: 27 etc.), the law given. Horeb is called "the mount of God" (@1 Kings 19: 8). It shows that we have to go up to reach the height of divine thoughts. The earthly-minded believer, like Lot, shrinks from the mountain: it is a place to dread. But on the mountain Jesus is seen transfigured. He is seen as heaven knows Him. Mark does not speak of His countenance as Luke, or of His face as

Matthew. It is simply, "he was transfigured before them". Matthew and Mark alone say "transfigured". He is seen as God's power, God's wisdom, hidden from men, but seen by His own as the "Lord of glory" (@1 Corinthians 2: 8). But we find that the transfiguration extends to His garments. They become shining ("white as the light", Matthew says; "white and effulgent", Luke says; "exceeding white ... such as fuller on earth could not whiten them", Mark says). I doubt "as snow" being right because this would be earthly whiteness, whereas the point seems to be that it is heavenly. Purity such as belongs to heaven is evidence of the kingdom having come in power, but seen here as investing the Son of man.
Then Elias and Moses appear as talking with Jesus. God's former testimonies are seen as communing with Jesus (Luke says "two men"). All that God had set up by Moses, and to which Elias had recalled an apostate people, is thus linked up with Jesus. Moses came down with glory shining in his face: Elias went up into the heavens by a whirlwind. The kingdom of God brings in the testimony of Moses and the prophets: they are in accord with Jesus. "For the spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus"; so here they speak with Him.
Peter puts the Lord first, but he gives Moses and Elias an almost equal place, not knowing what he should say. The cloud overshadows ...

THE TRANSFIGURATION
@Mark 9: 1 - 13
C.A.C. I thought we might continue what we have been looking at together. We have been looking together at the transfiguration as presented by Matthew and by Luke, and I thought it might be helpful to us to see the instruction connected with it as presented by Mark.
Matthew presents the Son of man coming in His kingdom, the kingdom in prospect. The future is brought into the present as divine light, so that we might be set now in the blessedness of what is yet future, for the Son of man has not yet come in His kingdom. We have something more than the prophetic word: prophecy is like a candle, Peter had "the prophetic word made surer" on the holy mountain: the day dawned in Peter's soul; the morning star arose in his heart when the Spirit put the power of it in his soul (@2 Peter 1: 16 - 21). We have "the day dawn" and "the morning star" as well as the lamp which makes the future present.
Luke presents the kingdom of God in pattern, the present character of the kingdom of God as known by the subjects of it, all patterned in Jesus.
Mark brings before us the kingdom of God come in power; he occupies us with the power of things; nothing is more important for us because the character of the present day is form without power, "Having a form of piety but denying the power of it" (@2 Timothy 3: 5). We all need a great deal of education about power; this chapter gives us a spiritual education in the subject of power, in what the power of God's kingdom really is. Naturally, we think of power as giving us ability to do great things here, but the prominent feature of the kingdom of God in power is the exceeding whiteness of His garments, "Such as fuller on earth could not whiten them". It is good for us to get that thought of power-
{80}
the greatest evidence of divine power at the present time is to be enabled to maintain purity. Mark's presentation of the kingdom is a peculiar one and differs from those of both Matthew and Luke. Mark puts Elias first -- we have all noticed that. Why does he put Elias first?
Rem. He comes last historically.
C.A.C. That is why Mark puts him first! Moses was the lawgiver, and he represents the ways of God in setting up the testimony originally; Elias comes in in connection with restoration, the restoring of things by prophetic ministry after things had departed. It is the line of restoration; the gospel of Mark has restoration specially in view.
Rem. Malachi speaks of Moses and Elijah (@Malachi 4: 4, 5).
C.A.C. He reminds them of Moses, but he says, "Behold, I send unto you Elijah the prophet", and the Lord says here, "Elias indeed, having first come, restores all things" (verse 12). What marks the ministry of Elias is restoration, restoration when everything has departed. When you have everything gone to corruption in the christian profession, you get the power to restore original purity.
Elias being put first suggests to me the thought of things being restored to original purity. Mark was a restored man himself; that is why he was selected to write this gospel, to render to the saints a service which he had himself experienced. What a pleasure it must have been to him to write about restoration; if there is not restoration there is nothing.
Ques. How long a time elapsed prior to Mark's restoration?
C.A.C. I do not know, but it says that "John separated from them and returned to Jerusalem" (@Acts 13: 13); he had been restored later (see @Colossians 4: 10, 11 and @2 Timothy 4: 11). He had proved the power of the kingdom in restoration. We know the kingdom in that character today. What marks it is the heavenly purity of it; purity of associations, "Such as fuller on earth could not whiten them", not of earth at all. It is a great thing to get that idea of power; that is, not to
{81}
do great things, but ability to maintain a character of purity suitable to God after all the corruption that has come in in christendom. It is most encouraging. No fuller on earth can give the heavenly touch; it is "in Christ Jesus"; in the glorified, heavenly One. In Malachi the Lord Himself is the Fuller (chapter 3: 1 - 4) and it is "the children of Levi", the servants, who are to be purified, mark that. It is restoration brought about by the heavenly Fuller. The kingdom in power brings in the action of the heavenly Fuller and Refiner. The original purity suitable to God as seen in Christ is the character of purity suitable to God, a heavenly character of purity.
The Lord pledges Himself to become the Fuller and Refiner, to bring about in the last days that which is pleasurable to God. If you once see the ways of God at any time you get the key to His ways at all times, purity of ways and associations, the holy purity that marks the people of God.
Mark's gospel is for the tribe of Levi, the servants; Mark presents the true Servant. The effect of going through Mark's gospel on your knees would be that the whole tribe of Levi would be purified. Do we want to come under the cleansing of that blessed One, a cleansing which no fuller on earth could accomplish? "Let thy garments be always white, and let not thy head lack oil" (@Ecclesiastes 9: 8). "Thou has a few names in Sardis which have not defiled their garments, and they shall walk with me in white, because they are worthy"
(@Revelation 3: 4). That is the kingdom in power, people walking with their garments undefiled. "Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, to keep oneself unspotted from the world" (@James 1: 27). Power is seen there, in the maintenance of a character of purity and associations suitable to God.
The days of Moses answer to the apostles¬, but those of Elias to the days when things are being restored by prophetic ministry. God cannot be satisfied with a second-best; it must be restoration to first principles. The power of it is set forth in pattern in Jesus. The object in view in all this is that there
{82}
may be pleasure for God in His people, "Pleasant unto Jehovah, as in the days of old, and as in former years" (@Malachi 3: 4). God looks for that in His kingdom; His people should be for His pleasure, and should take a sacrificial character and become characterised by a pure oblation (@Malachi 1: 11). "Every sacrifice shall be salted with salt" (@Mark 9: 49).
The effect of learning the power of the kingdom would be that we should become an oblation, an acceptable offering to God. I hope we all covet to be sacrificed; there is nothing for the pleasure of God apart from that.
Ques. Is this @Romans 12: 1, "I beseech you ... to present your bodies a living sacrifice"?
C.A.C. He brings the compassions of God to bear upon us to that end, and there we "prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God".
Rem. "And be not conformed to this world".
C.A.C. "But be transformed" or transfigured; it is the same word. It is all linked up with the transfiguration. The saints are to be transfigured. If we present our bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is our intelligent service, we shall come out in the holy purity of the kingdom, and that is the evidence of power.
Rem. "Strengthened with all power according to the might of his glory unto all endurance and longsuffering with joy" (@Colossians 1: 11).
C.A.C. It shows the line of power; the kingdom in power enables you to preserve a character of associations so white that there is not a spot left to hinder you listening to the beloved Son. "And there came a voice out of the cloud, This is my beloved Son: hear him". A people who are transfigured are ready for translation, a people answering to that character of things seen in Christ on the mount. If the will of man has been displaced in my affections by the will of God, I am transfigured, and from inside there is a new kind of mind, of thinking, patterned after Christ. People think of the will of God as to where they should live, but it is all seen in
{83}
Christ. It is not a question of whether I live here or there; the will of God is seen in Christ, set forth in purity and power. If my affections have gone out to Christ, preferring Christ to myself and saying, 'I have seen a Person I like better than myself', that is the start of a Christian. He falls in love with what He sees in Christ; he has started now with the will of God. Until then, he has been occupied with self: good self, bad self or middling self; the eye now sees an Object in whom shines the will of God. I see it in all its perfection in Christ. Can we really say, 'I prefer what I have found in Christ to anything I have ever found in myself'?
Ques. What is meant in @Philippians 4: 11, "1 have learnt in those circumstances in which I am, to be satisfied in myself"?
C.A.C. The apostle was a man of resources -- he was satisfied in himself; the word is that used of an island that produces in itself everything that the inhabitants need, self-contained, independent of anything outside. The apostle was satisfied inside with Christ and the Spirit. He had the resources of the kingdom in himself. There is absolutely nothing in the kingdom of God but the will of God; you could not have the will of man there. The power of that kingdom liberates us from every influence to listen to the voice of the beloved Son, and to hear Him tell us that He has sanctified us, and made us sons with Him who is above. It gives us a marvellous place in the resurrection world. It is all coming out in resurrection. You carry your own secret, you are one of the brethren of Christ; you do not want to be displayed in this world, but to move through this world in the power of that world. That is the power of the kingdom.
It would help us to start with the fact that the path of Christ is impossible to man, but possible in the power of the kingdom. The disciples could not use the power of the kingdom; we are often like that, not sufficiently cast upon God or in the spirit of self-renunciation -- all the power of the kingdom is in Him; He could meet the whole situation; if
{84}
I have not the power, He has. God has brought in His grace and the power of the kingdom that we might be patterned after Christ. The new commandment is, "Which thing is true in him and in you" (@1 John 2: 8). It is to be seen in those who believe on Christ.
This chapter shows us how the power works; the disciples did not understand it, they were disputing, "reasoning with one another who was greatest" (verse 34). Is that the kingdom in power? "And taking a little child he set it in their midst, and having taken it in his arms he said to them". Are you content to be a little child in the hands of Jesus, one who is conscious of being loved by Him? That is the power of the kingdom. Only as in the power of the kingdom can I be "last of all, and minister of all", as a little child in the arms of Jesus, conscious of being in the love of Christ and bringing the affections of Christ with me. I would rather the brethren received me as a little child in the arms of Jesus than as a 'big brother'. The power of the kingdom is there. The only claim that I have to attention is that I am Christ's. "For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye are Christ's, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward" (verse 41).
John had to be educated (verse 38); he did not understand the power of the kingdom. Everybody who is doing the work of the Lord is "for us" (verse 40). Whatever is being done which is really the work of the Lord is "for us". It is different in @Matthew 12: 30, "He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathers not with me scatters". There is to be no neutral position with regard to positive adversaries, such as those who deny the inspiration of Scripture, the atonement and so on; they are against Christ. There is to be no neutral position with regard to them, but here (verses 38, 39) the man was "casting out demons in thy name"; you can pray for such; they are "for us". But I feel very sorry for that man; he was doing the work of the Lord, but he was not walking with the Lord; he missed the path, and the privilege of the divine
{85}
path. 'There is but that one in the waste, Which His footsteps have marked as His own'. He was serving Him but not walking with Jesus and following Him. He was exercising the power of the kingdom externally, but not internally.
And how are we to act with regard to a snare? Cut it off! Snares expose us to temptation and evil. "Cut it off" (verses 43 - 48). Is it what you read? "Thine, eye"? It is a positive snare. Is it a place in the world that you are after? Better be maimed for this world. Snares are the way to hell. Do you say, 'I thought believers did not go to hell'? Is that to be an excuse for walking a step that way? It is a solemn thing to walk that way. If you do not want to reach the terminus, do not go that way.
The Lord helps us: "For every one shall be salted with fire" (verse 49). The Lord's judgment and discipline help us. I am a firm believer in purgatory, for I have been there myself, but in this world. "But if we judged ourselves, so were we not judged. But being judged, we are disciplined of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world" (@1 Corinthians 11: 31, 32). You have a principle within you whereby you can judge yourself. You do not let the salt lose its savour. You do not let what is of God lose its savour in your soul. If the kingdom is in power the salt will keep its savour, salt in ourselves in our own exercises carried out with God and salt on the sacrifice. "Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another". Be self-judged and thus there will be no element of discord; for the people of God to walk in peace together is the kingdom of God in power. These things are most exercising and helpful.
{86}
WHEN WILL THE LORD COME?
@Mark 13: 32 - 37
There are other parables in Matthew and Luke with similar teaching to this one. In all of them there are servants waiting for the return of their master, and exhorted to watch because the moment of his arrival is uncertain. There are two events to which these parables are commonly applied. Some teach that they refer to the coming of Christ at the end of the world. They cannot mean this, because as all Christians agree, according to Scripture, there is to be a millennium -- a thousand years of peace and blessing -- before the end of the world, and how can we "watch" for an event which we know to be a thousand years off?
Then another and more usual explanation of these parables is that they refer to death. The Scriptures show that the Lord's coming is not death. Moreover, in all these parables the coming of Christ is spoken of as being at an unknown and unexpected time. Now this is not usually the case with death, which in the vast majority of cases gives full warning of its approach.
It is clear that these parables refer neither to the end of the world nor to the hour of death. Their application is to the coming of the Lord. Christ tells us most distinctly here that no man knoweth the day or the hour. If these servants had known that the master was not coming until morning, they would have gone to sleep, but he desired them to watch till he came, and therefore he did not tell them the hour of his coming. The Lord has not told us when He is coming, that we may watch for Him always. If it had been recorded that the Lord was not coming for nineteen hundred years, it would have robbed the early Christians, and all past generations of believers, of that "blessed hope" which had such a prominent place in the teaching of the apostles, and was such a cherished part of the faith which believers held in those early days.
{87}
Much discredit to the truth has been brought about by the vain imaginings of men who have pretended to discover from prophecy the exact date of the Lord's return. One simple scripture is sufficient to disclose the unspiritual character of their pretensions. We always find that these men fix dates more or less distant from the present moment. If they say the Lord is coming in ten years, or one year, or next week, it is saying in substance, "My lord delays to come", and that is the utterance of the wicked bondman (@Luke 12: 45). The Lord's coming may take place at any moment, and He expects every believer to be waiting and watching for Him.
But has not the world to be converted before Christ comes? In @2 Timothy 3 we have a prophetic description of the professing church in the "last days". Do we read anything there about a triumphant gospel and a converted world? On the contrary, we find there a picture of evil which is almost identical with that which the Spirit of God has given us of the heathen world before christianity came into it. Compare this with @Romans 1: 29 - 32.
Be not deceived; the future of the professing church is summed up in one dark word -- apostasy. Soon Jesus will come and receive every saved soul, every true believer, to Himself. He will then completely disown the great mass of empty profession which will be left behind, spewing it out of His mouth (@Revelation 3: 16). The professing church, deprived of every living member of Christ's body, will continue its history on earth as Babylon, whose haughty pride and whose fearful doom are so vividly described in @Revelation 17 and 18.
There is not one prophecy to be fulfilled before Christ may come. His coming is our present hope.
But does it not say plainly that it is "appointed unto men once to die"? The scripture in @Hebrews 9: 26 - 28 speaks of Christ's one offering and says, "Now once in the consummation of the ages he has been manifested for the putting away of sin by his sacrifice. And forasmuch as it is the portion of men once to die, and after this judgment; thus the Christ
{88}
also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear to those that look for him the second time without sin for salvation".
It is in the order of nature that men should die, but why is this stated here? Simply to bring out the fact that Christ has taken man's place and endured the death and judgment which man and his sins deserved. The believer sees the judgment of his sins at Calvary, by faith reckons Christ's death as his own, and has eternal life in the risen glorified Son of God. Read @John 5: 24, where the word "judgment" is the same as that in @Hebrews 9: 27, and say if our deliverance from death and judgment could be more complete. Everlasting glory be to God and to the Lamb!
If the Lord should tarry we may fall asleep, but "we shall not all fall asleep". If the Lord comes this hour "we shall all be changed, in an instant" (@1 Corinthians 15: 52), and have our bodies fashioned like unto His glorious body without dying at all.
Many scriptures might be quoted to show how real the hope of the Lord's return was to the early Christians. The defrauded labourer, suffering injustice, was exhorted to "have patience ... till the coming of the Lord", and was comforted by being told that "the coming of the Lord is drawn nigh" (@James 5: 7, 8). The saints at Corinth were "awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ" (@1 Corinthians 1: 7). The believers at Thessalonica had been converted "to God from idols to serve a living and true God, and to await his Son from the heavens" (@1 Thessalonians 1: 9, 10). The Lord's coming was not to them a vague, visionary idea, of little or no importance, as it is, alas, to many believers nowadays. It was the object of their fondest hopes, a source of deepest joy. Are we, as believers, imitating their example? The Lord is coming. We are drawing near to the glorious and happy termination of our wilderness journey. "Behold, the bridegroom" (@Matthew 25: 6).
{89}
THE FULNESS OF THE SUPPER
@Mark 14: 22 - 24
I have no doubt that it was intended that we should carry with us the thoughts suggested in each gospel with regard to the Supper. We do not get the same presentation in each gospel, but the Spirit would enable us to hold each in its place with intelligence. We shall then distinguish and gain the value of each. The institution of the Lord's supper is only in Luke; only in that gospel do we find the words, "This do in remembrance of me". We could not gather from Matthew or Mark that it was ever to be done again. The thought of remembrance is not introduced there; what is suggested is rather the spiritual apprehension and appropriation which would qualify us to take up the remembrance as in Luke. We have to carry in our souls what Mark and Matthew present as well as what Luke presents; we should then be prepared spiritually to take the Supper together as instituted in Luke.
The disciples¬ thoughts did not go beyond the passover, but the Lord was about to give great expansion. However far we have got in our knowledge of divine things, it is possible that the Lord may add something. We only know in part, so that we may look for continued additions. It is the Lord's pleasure to add to us; so that we may come more and more into the precious light of God and be affected by it.
"And as they were eating, Jesus, having taken bread, when he had blessed, broke it, and gave it to them, and said, Take this: this is my body". The lamb being killed and roast with fire spoke of the unblemished perfection of Christ and His ability to take up the question of sin and to bear its holy judgment so that every claim of God might be met and the ground cleared for the blessing of His people. The love in which Christ bore the judgment becomes the nourishment of those who believe; they eat the lamb roast with fire. That in itself is a great apprehension of Christ; it brings us to true
{90}
self-judgment, for it is the evidence that all that attached to us, as in the flesh, was of such a character that it called for the judgment of God, but the spotless One has come under the judgment and been sacrificed for us, and the love in which He did so is food for our hearts.
But as they were eating the passover the Lord introduced a new figure of Himself; He took bread. This was something additional; it presented Him in an aspect different from the passover Lamb. The passover was the divine provision in view of sin and its judgment according to God's glory; it spoke of the suitability and sufficiency of Christ in that relation. But His coming into the world in a body brought in all the pleasure of God in a Man here, and it had in view the establishment of the pleasure of God in the sanctified ones through the offering of that body.
The Lord blessed the bread in Matthew and Mark; He gave thanks in Luke. In blessing it He invested it with a new and spiritual meaning; He clothed it with a new significance for His disciples, but in giving thanks He took a place on their side in the acknowledgment of all that was set forth there as come in on God's part for man's infinite blessing. In giving thanks He takes up all the value of it as on our behalf Godward. But in the gospel before us He blessed; He gave that bread a wholly new character as constituting it a symbol of His body. When He says, "This is my body", what wondrous thoughts are suggested to faith! It is no longer a question of the removal of sin or bearing its judgment but of the coming in, according to @Psalm 40, of all that is positively delightful to God, and of its coming in in such a way as to be available for all who believe on Him. The whole sacrificial service of judaism, failing to meet the pleasure of God, is set aside.
My impression is that, the Lord having connected this precious figure of Himself with the passover, that feast will never more for faith be separated from the apprehension and appropriation of what came here in Christ for the positive
{91}
delight of God. That blessed One coming in flesh, the second Man out of heaven, could not fail to bring in this new and greater blessing, and He linked it on to the passover by giving it to them as they were eating the passover. A young convert might not apprehend more than the passover aspect of Christ's death. Indeed I suppose many pious persons do not go beyond this. They come to what they call the holy communion with affectionate gratitude to the Lord for having died for them and borne the judgment due to their sins. But the Lord would lead them to see much more than this in His body given and His blood poured out. The communion which Christians are privileged to enjoy together, of which the eating of the Lord's supper is the public expression, takes its character from what the Lord instituted Himself, which every spiritual person must see goes much beyond what was set forth in the passover. We could not eat the passover now in a spiritual sense without recalling that the Lord has connected with it this new and blessed figure of Himself. To everyone who knows what it is to eat the passover the Lord would say, "Take this: this is my body", and He would help each one to apprehend what was secured by His taking that body, and by the offering of it in death. Israel in a coming day will not only know the passover aspect of the death of Christ, but they will see Him as the One who has brought in all the will of God -- the Servant of divine pleasure. How they will delight in "my servant", as Isaiah speaks of Him! They will see the law, the sacrifices, the promises, all fulfilled and perfected in Christ. They will apprehend all the pleasure of God in Christ; they will "take" it as made good in Him. This is our great privilege today; we take up the will of God in an entirely new way as made good in Christ. None of it could be available for us apart from His death. It was through the offering of His body that all was secured. They would not take the bread actually until He broke it, neither could we take it spiritually apart from His death. The Lord breaking the bread would intimate that the
{92}
pleasure of God could only take effect in regard of us through His death. Now He says, "Take". He would have us apprehend all that has come in through the dedication of His body in death. It is our privilege to apprehend the wondrous ways of God in Christ: how He has brought in His whole pleasure as unfolded in @Hebrews 10, and how we are perfected in conscience and set apart for God in the value of it. The passover clears the ground; the man under judgment has gone in judgment. But that is not all, the pleasure of God has come in as fully secured in Christ, who has gone into death that we might be sanctified according to that pleasure.
The Lord's calling attention to His body in Mark would specially bring before us what that body was in relation to the service of God; He was "my servant". The effect of His coming in was to introduce every element that was delightful to God. But then the fact that He took bread intimates that it was to become food for us, so that we might live by Him, in the strength of what came here in Him. What is prominent in Mark is that the Lord says, "Take"; in Matthew He adds, "Eat". We must "take" before we can "eat"; apprehension comes before appropriation. We must first spiritually apprehend what is set forth in the bread as His body, then we can eat; we can appropriate what is spiritually set forth in that bread. Eating would suggest that the spiritual constitution of the disciples was to be built up on Christ so that they might come out morally in the life of Christ, so that what was true in Him might become true in them. There is nothing in us for the pleasure of God which has not been derived from Christ, and of which Christ is not the strength. Matthew presents very fully the moral character of Christ -- the true character of the kingdom set forth in the King. The beatitudes give us this, and it is in that gospel that He says, "Learn from me; for I am meek and lowly in heart" (@Matthew 11: 29). We are to take character and constitution from Him. All that is pleasurable to God having come in, it is to be perpetuated in the saints as brought under the influence of
{93}
heaven, and strength for this lies in the appropriation of Christ. If we have apprehended the fulfilled pleasure of God in Christ and have appropriated Him so as to live by Him, we find ourselves in a world where Christ is not, and we find that we are privileged to come together for the affectionate remembrance of Him in the eating of His supper.
The 'taking' as in Mark, and the 'eating' as in Matthew, would have a spiritual import, and would be preparatory to the affectionate remembrance of the assembly as called for in @Luke 22 and @1 Corinthians 11. In the latter scripture the eating is the public act of eating the Lord's supper, which may be done worthily or unworthily. The Lord would take account of anything irreverent or unbecoming in the manner of our eating His supper. If one took it as one would take bread and wine in an ordinary sense it would be profane, and would make one guilty in respect of the body and of the blood of the Lord. If one did not distinguish the body (@1 Corinthians 11: 29) it would prove that he had not really taken it according to @Mark 14: 22. Taking and eating in an inward and spiritual sense would be necessary as a preparation for rightly remembering the Lord, and announcing His death, as those who love Him and who feel His absence here.
Then the cup does not speak of the blood of the passover lamb, sheltering from judgment, but it is the blood of the covenant, shed for many. It secures righteously the setting up of relations between God and His people which give satisfaction to His love. The covenant is unalterable because it stands in virtue of the blood of Christ. God found fault with the first covenant because it did not make His love known to His people, and it did not set them before Him in suitability to His love or in response to it. But "the covenant" -- it is doubtful whether "new" should be in Mark or Matthew, though it is in Luke -- now makes known the love of God in its fulness, for it is in the blood of His own Son. God has revealed Himself in the blessedness of His nature; He yearned to be known in His love, and that not by a few, but
{94}
by "many". He is going to bring "many" into the covenant. Whatever is needed on their part He will do. He will work in them by a thousand exercises, stripping them of every bit of self-complacency and self-confidence, emptying them of everything that they have trusted in, or thought of value, but this is all that they may acquire ability by His own work to appreciate His love and respond to it. He will give Israel a new heart and put a new spirit within them; He will put His Spirit within them, and give them one heart and one way so that they fear Him all their days and do not turn aside from Him. See @Jeremiah 32 and @Ezekiel 36.
The aspect of the covenant that is brought before us here is that it is a cup out of which all the disciples drank. It is a drinking of the love of God such as could not really be apart from the gift of the Holy Spirit. The love of God known as a rich and cheering draught making glad the heart as He is known there in the blessedness of His holy love. "All shall know me in themselves". The knowledge of God in love comes into the hearts of "many", and becomes the living power of the covenant bond which binds His people to Him in an unalterable way. I have no doubt that when the apostle says that we "have all been given to drink of one Spirit"
(@1 Corinthians 12: 13) there was a link in his mind with what he speaks of as "the cup of the Lord". As drinking of one Spirit the saints are possessed of divine love; they have it in themselves; and this becomes the spring in their hearts from which such features develop as are described in @1 Corinthians 13.
But we are possessed of love as having found it in God, and as having drunk into it through the death of His Son, so that what is witnessed in the blood of Christ has a real place with us inwardly by the Holy Spirit. In Luke it is "for you"; the assembly is there in view as the company that alone stands in the blessedness of the new covenant now. But in Matthew and Mark it is "for many"; the outlook embraces all that will come into the bond of the covenant, whether the remnant, or the houses of Israel and Judah in the coming days. Saints of
{95}
the assembly know the covenant in a peculiar and blessed way as the ministry of the Spirit and the ministry of righteousness (@2 Corinthians 3). It is characterised by subsisting and abounding glory, and it gives access to the holiest. How blessed to drink into the love which is the spring of all in the heart of God!
The Lord adds a word which He emphasises by "Verily I say to you", as to "the fruit of the vine". He felt it to be of much importance to them to know this, and surely it is not less so to us. It is essential to the spiritual understanding of christianity that we should know what the Lord meant when He said, "Verily I say to you, I will no more drink at all of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God". "I will no more drink" intimates that up to that time He had drunk of it. It referred, I think there can be no doubt, to the joy the Lord had in being with His beloved disciples after the flesh. He had His delight in that association. They were very precious to Him as the "little flock", "the salt of the earth", and "the light of the world". They were the children that Jehovah had given Him. He had been with them as the Bridegroom, and they had been "sons of the bridechamber".
This expression "the fruit of the vine" lets us into what it had been to Him to recognise in them as the true Israel, the product of His Father's planting (@Matthew 15: 31), and yielding Him such fruit as He had looked for in the vine which He brought out of Egypt. He had found it pleasant to drink of the fruit of that vine in the midst of all the wild grapes which the nation at large was bringing forth.
The blessedness of the covenant was there in His own Person, for He was the Covenant (@Isaiah 42: 6; @Isaiah 49: 8). All the wealth and blessedness of God was there to win men to Himself, and the disciples had in some measure entered into this, and been sharers in the ministry of it. It had been a festive time (@Mark 2: 19) with its own peculiar character of joy. There was something of new covenant character about it as
{96}
making God known, but it needed His death to do that fully, and that meant the breaking of the link of association as according to flesh. All that could be made known of God was there in Christ incarnate. But the full revelation of His love could only come out through the death to which all was leading.
It was blessed for Christ to be with His own according to flesh, and to have them as His eye-witnesses and attendants, companying with Him. It was a joy that was of God, so that it was "the fruit of the vine" to Him. His delight was in the saints (@Psalm 16: 3) and His companionship with them as "the sons of the bridechamber" was sweet to Him as it was also their joy. But they had to be prepared for that association coming to an end, so that its joy might be known in a new way. None of its blessedness would be lost, but it would be tasted under entirely new conditions. He could not continue with them as the Bridegroom; He would no longer enjoy their companionship as with them according to flesh. However blessed the remembrance of the association in which they had been with Him here, it was according to flesh, and they were to know it as having been terminated by His being taken away from them.
If we are to understand christianity, we must know the great change from Christ, according to flesh, to Christ, risen and glorified. We must know the difference between being disciples here awaiting the gift of the Spirit -- though knowing the joy of the Bridegroom's presence -- and being put into correspondence with a risen and heavenly Christ by the reception of the Holy Spirit, and thus set up in the kingdom of God.
It is worth while for us to pay a good deal of attention to this statement of our Lord as to "the fruit of the vine". There was to be another day in which He would drink it in a new and different way. He would be a risen and exalted Man, and His disciples would stand in all the blessedness of His body as given, taken and eaten, and in the joy of the covenant in His
{97}
blood. Though the disciples were subjects of the Father's work and teaching, plants of His planting, they could not possibly apprehend or appropriate His body or His blood until He died. They were still in the flesh, but He had just been leading them, anticipatively, to apprehend and appropriate His body and His blood, that they might pass into new spiritual conditions. It is as having done so that we can look back, and say "when we were in the flesh" (@Romans 7: 5). We know Christ according to flesh no longer; we know ourselves according to flesh no longer. We stand in the value of His body given for us, and of the covenant in His blood, and we have the Holy Spirit. Christ having died is no longer "according to flesh", and as we apprehend and appropriate His body and His blood we realise that we are not in the flesh.
"That day when I drink it new" tells of the present joy of the Lord in and with His own. The day has come when the Lord drinks of the fruit of the vine in a new way in the kingdom of God. He has joy in His own in a new way. He has gone through death, and He has brought them through death on to entirely new ground. They stand in the value of His body and His blood in the power of the Holy Spirit, and they are in the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God is the sphere where the will of God is carried into effect through the Lord Jesus Christ and in the power of the Holy Spirit. There the Lord has His joy; He drinks the fruit of the vine. He has joy in His own as blessed in Himself, and blessed in the knowledge of God as revealed in love. It looks on, no doubt, to the time when the will of God, as established through the death of Christ, will have its place with Israel, and they will drink into the covenant and be in the kingdom of God. But this is anticipated in saints of the assembly now. In thinking of the joy which we have in drinking of the cup of the covenant, let us not forget His drinking -- the joy which He has in His saints as blessed according to the pleasure of God in Him, and as made to drink into the love of God. We may gather many precious thoughts of the Lord's joy in His
{98}
own from @John 13 - 17. All this is the precious divine truth. It is for us to recognise it, and to identify ourselves intelligently and affectionately with it. Our great concern should be to know the truth and to be thoroughly identified with it. Nothing else is of any value.
Then we must not overlook the sweet touch in @Matthew 26: 29: "Until that day when I drink it new with you". This is additional to what we have in @Mark 14: 25. It is His own portion and joy in Mark, but in Matthew it is added that He would drink with His loved ones. He would share with them, and they with Him. It is the joy of the Head shared by the whole company of those who have taken and eaten His body, and who have drunk the blood of the covenant. Our Lord and Head is joyous; He has brought to pass the pleasure of God, and revealed the love of God, and on His side He has set His saints in the blessedness of this. It is a searching question for each one of us, 'Am I enjoying what the Lord enjoys? Am I really in accord with Him?' Where would be dissatisfied or unsatisfied hearts if we knew this in spiritual reality?
But then if He associates His own with His joy, and shares it with them, we find ourselves carried beyond the thought of the kingdom of God. In @Matthew 26: 29 it is "in the kingdom of my Father". A sweet and holy touch of relationship is brought in. It is the kingdom of Him who is in the affectionate relationship of Father to Christ. The character and features of that kingdom were seen perfectly in the beloved Son as Man here. The rule of that kingdom was in manifestation here. So that when He taught His disciples to pray that the Father's kingdom might come, they knew what they were praying for; they had seen the true character of it in Him. Well might they pray that it should come and irradiate the earth with its light and blessedness.
His Father's kingdom will be realised and set forth in a company of sons, who will "shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father" (@Matthew 13: 43). @Matthew 17 begins
{99}
with the transfiguration where Jesus is announced by the Father as "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight: hear him". But in hearing Him we learn how He sets His own in the same relationship; this we see at the end of the chapter. "What dost thou think, Simon? the kings of the earth, from whom do they receive custom or tribute? from their own sons or from strangers? Peter says to him, From strangers. Jesus said to him, Then are the sons free. But that we may not be an offence to them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up, and when thou hast opened its mouth thou wilt find a stater; take that and give it to them for me and thee".
Think of the joy of the Lord in having a company of sons to be with Himself as knowing the Father's rule in parental affection. They are in the kingdom of His Father; they have learned to know God as Christ's Father, and to know Him in the liberty of the Spirit of sonship, but also in the rule and discipline of His love. In the kingdom of His Father there is parental government (see @1 Peter 1: 17) and fatherly chastening (see @Hebrews 12: 5 - 11). Those in that kingdom have not only received sonship through infinite divine favour and love according to @Galatians 4: 4 - 7, but they have known the instruction and correction of sons under the Father's disciplinary rule. In that way they acquire the education and manners of sons. What joy has Christ in and with such! In an order of things which is of His Father, Christ can have joy with His own. We cannot have the companionship of Christ in the world of lawlessness, but we can have it in the kingdom of God and of Christ's Father. What is still future as to public manifestation is spiritually present now.
This leads to singing. "And having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives". We cannot doubt that the Lord Jesus led that singing. It was an anticipation of how He would as the risen and ascended One be found singing in the midst of the assembly (@Psalm 22: 22; @Hebrews 2: 12). We do not know what they actually sang in the guest-chamber, but what a
{100}
hymn does Christ sing in the midst of the assembly! How He celebrates the praises of God as having secured the establishment of His pleasure! He hymns the One who has made known the depth and blessedness of His love in the covenant. He sings as One who delights in the company of His brethren to whom He has made known His Father and God as their Father and God. He sings as knowing the Father's delight in having a company of sons, of whom He Himself is the Firstborn, and who are to be brought to full conformity to Him in heavenly glory. The assembly is the fruit of God's eternal purpose and electing love, now brought to light through redemption. It is composed of those into whose hearts the Spirit of God's Son has been sent out crying "Abba, Father". How rightly is God praised in song for all this! If we taste the joy of it how can we help singing? The hearts that know it, even in small measure, must be uplifted in grateful and joyous notes. Our Lord and Head is in the perfect intelligence and joy of all that He has revealed, and of all that He has secured for God and for us. The nearer we get to Him the better shall we understand it, and the deeper will be our joy. I have no doubt we have an intimation here of how these precious spiritual realities work out in the souls of saints as divinely taught under the influence of Christ.

GOSPEL ACCORDING TO LUKE
{102}
{103}
NOTES OF A READING
@Luke 2: 22 - 40
Rem. Although Simeon was not an official priest, he was a spiritual one.
C.A.C. The Spirit's day seems anticipated in Simeon. "The Holy Spirit was upon him" (verse 25); things were "communicated to him by the Holy Spirit" (verse 26); he was moved by the Spirit.
Rem. The Spirit of God has a great place in these early chapters.
C.A.C. God prepares spiritual conditions. The chapter is full of holy exercises and affections. The suitability of all the persons is obvious. God prepares conditions when He is going to move, especially when He is about to move in a new way, as now -- it is a spiritual and priestly character of things here in Luke.
Rem. The shepherds found "the babe lying in the manger" (verse 16) and here Simeon "received him into his arms" (verse 28).
C.A.C. The great sign is "a babe" (verse 12). It is the great sign in the New Testament. "And this is the sign to you: ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling-clothes, and lying in a manger". In the Old Testament the sign is "Behold, the virgin shall conceive and shall bring forth a son" (@Isaiah 7: 14), but in the New Testament it is "a babe". How the grace of God was coming down to the lowest point to meet man, that God might shine out in His grace!
Rem. Simeon "received him into his arms, and blessed God".
Ques. Why did he bless God, and not the Babe?
C.A.C. You would not expect him to bless Jesus because the Babe was not the Source of all blessing. When we embrace the Lord Jesus we are put in priestly relations with God and have something to offer to God.
{104}
It is important to give place to the Spirit of God. We see in Simeon, beforehand, a beautiful intimation of the activities of the Spirit.
Ques. Was not Mary a priest, and are not sisters priests?
C.A.C. Any one who is near to God is a priest -- that is the designation of a priest. We read, "And the priests also, who come near to Jehovah" before Aaron was consecrated (@Exodus 19: 22). Here, there were a number of persons near to God who understood the character of the day that was dawning -- "the dayspring from on high has visited us" (@Luke 1: 78).
Rem. We are told the way He came in here.
C.A.C. Yes, and it gives you a key to what you are to look for. That is, the most insignificant things outwardly. We have to be consistent with the manger sign. It is suitable to God, for if God comes into a scene of disorder, He must come in at the bottom and bring in His salvation! It is the intervention of God in grace in God's anointed One, the Christ. He would come in at the top if all were in order, and will do. He has come in flesh and at the very lowest point; Adam began as a full-grown man, but the Babe comes in in the greatest weakness.
Rem. Here the sign is that He is actually and truly a Babe. How we love the manger!
C.A.C. It is the character of things that God would have faith look for. It is the great sign that God would have us consider. You look for the greatest things spiritually but not pretentious, and you do not expect to see many grand people connected with the testimony. "For consider your calling, brethren, that there are not many wise according to flesh, not many powerful, not many high-born" (@1 Corinthians 1: 26). You go along with the lowly (@Romans 12: 16). You look for what is spiritually great, persons greatly dignified by Christ becoming the power and wisdom of God to them.
"A light for revelation of the Gentiles"; there are a few here tonight! "And the glory of thy people Israel"; when they have lost all their own glory. In chapter 7 the Gentile is
{105}
brought to light for blessing in the centurion who evidences "so great faith". "For revelation of the Gentiles" means that they should come into view as having faith; and then, the woman gets a new glory -- there is "nothing to pay", and she finds her glory in the "certain creditor" (@Luke 7: 41). You can understand her laying her glory at His feet; it works that way, and God has visited His people that way, a way suitable to Himself and suitable to us. He becomes our glory. Salvation, forgiveness and all that His lost and guilty creature needs are brought in for him.
Simeon understood by the Spirit that the Lord was going to be rejected; else, he would have said, 'Let me stay and see the kingdom glory'. He really gives up the earth because he realises that although the glory and blessing of God are coming in, they are not yet to have any place here, so he says, 'Let me go'.
Rem. These are the lines on which the Spirit moves today. Spirituality lies in the knowledge of God and in the appreciation of Christ, as bringing in the light of God. Ignorance of that brings in the confusion which is existing today.
C.A.C. Simeon is a beautiful character for us to study. His soul was filled with all the blessedness that had really come in. The salvation of God was there.
Rem. There are four indications of His death in this chapter. He came to die. All heaven is moved here, but in Matthew all Jerusalem is moved to put Him to death.
Rem. The Lord said, "I praise thee, Father, ... thou ... hast revealed them to babes" (@Matthew 11: 25).
C.A.C. Glory belongs to God. If God brings in what is of Himself, His anointed One, He does not make anything of man.
Ques. Will you tell us further as to "alight for revelation of the Gentiles"?
C.A.C. Luke, a Gentile, and writing to a Gentile, makes a great point of that. God was going to bring the Gentiles into view for blessing as having appreciation of Christ -- as
{106}
Simeon has here -- for the pleasure of God. The promises did not extend to the Gentiles, generally speaking; but God's salvation could not be limited to Israel.
Rem. You get expanded when near God.
C.A.C. There is nothing like getting near to God for expansion. The meaning of the two names Simeon and Anna is interesting. Simeon means 'one who hears', Anna means 'one who gives'. Those two things must always go together. The Lord had spoken to Simeon, and Anna's mouth is opened to speak. She is the spreader abroad of the Light that had come in. We must hear first before we speak. It was true even as regards the Lord. He says in the prophetic scriptures, "He wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the instructed". Every day He entered on His service having been instructed as a Learner. "The Lord Jehovah hath given me the tongue of the instructed, that I should know how to succour by a word him that is weary" (@Isaiah 50: 4). The tongue was dependent upon the ear.
Rem. We have a dumb priest in chapter I but praising priests in chapter 24, "continually in the temple praising and blessing God".
Ques. Would you connect verse 35, "and even a sword shall go through thine own soul", with @Genesis 3: 16?
C.A.C. It indicates the deep exercise through which light and blessing must come in. It is very deep exercise to realise that Christ must be rejected. Everything turned on that Child. "Lo, this child is set for the fall and rising up of many in Israel, and for a sign spoken against". He becomes the turning point of everything. He is either "a stone of stumbling" or "for a sanctuary" (@Isaiah 8: 14). Some stumbled over Him but He is set for a sanctuary for others. Christ is still the great test; He brings to light the thoughts of many hearts. You bring Christ in and everything is exposed. What a change there is in a family when God comes in and converts one of them. Ishmael is a mocker when Isaac is honoured. Everyone is tested and measured by Christ. The features of
{107}
the righteous One coming out in Abel brought out the hatred in Cain. You will get some reproach if the ways of Christ come out in you. It is the beauty and ways of Christ that bring out the hatred in man's heart. The Man of God's delight and the man after the flesh could not be brought into partnership. "That the thoughts may be revealed from many hearts", the thoughts of God's heart and of man's heart and the thoughts of faith. Ishmael is the man that does not appreciate Christ; that is the character of my flesh, I have that in me that is like that. It gives me a great shock when I find that out.
Rem. The best part of us hates Christ worst of all.
C.A.C. It would have been a fine thing for Peter if he had kept up his first convictions. "I am a sinful man, Lord". We do not maintain our first convictions, and that leads to all sorts of trouble. Repentance deepens all through the lifetime of a saint; you cannot get over it as you would measles. With increased light of God, we judge ourselves but we are enriched in Another. Simeon and Anna were enriched in Another. God has brought in what delights His own heart. I have thought that, perhaps, one reason why Christ was brought in as a Babe was that man in every feature of his development was thus presented before God according to His pleasure. Increasing development of perfection was brought before God in Christ from the Babe to the Man. Always perfect but yet there was development. "First the blade, then an ear, then full corn in the ear" (@Mark 4: 28). That is maturity. "Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight" (@Luke 3: 22), is said of all the thirty years. And that Person is God's salvation for us, a salvation without a flaw. There should be growth with us. We begin with a sense of the perfection of Christ as God's salvation for us but the Spirit continually develops in our souls new apprehensions of Christ, that we may be, as Peter says, "neither idle nor unfruitful as regards the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ" (@2 Peter 1: 8). We are thinking a little more
{108}
of the preciousness of Christ this week than we did last week. The Lord is spoken of as "the Branch", in the footnote in @Zechariah 3: 8, the 'Sprout'. A new Shoot of an entirely new character. There is development of perfection in Him. Wherever you look elsewhere you will find a flaw but the more you consider Him, the more His beauty shines out. And there is a company developing after the same order. "There shall be abundance of corn in the earth, upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon" (@Psalm 72: 16). Saints will come out in the world to come with appreciation of Christ; there is nothing like it. And here in these chapters (@Luke 1 and 2) they come one after another, in secret cherishing Christ, with beautiful utterances, filled with appreciation of Christ. It would, and will, separate us from this present evil world. Deliverance is to be occupied with Christ, and devoted to His interests. When I am occupied with Christ in secret, at that moment I am holy and in my responsible pathway I am devoted to His interests. All that the disciples found in themselves made them appreciate all that they found in Him. Just as God had prepared a suitable company then to receive Him, so now He is forming the saints¬ affections on Christ. It would not be suitable to God for the Lord to return without there being a people prepared to receive Him. I know the character of the Spirit's movement in all the hearts of His own by how He moves in my heart. God is going to maintain the devotion of Christ's heart before His saints. My confidence is in God. His movements are great. One would not look for great things outwardly, but for the greatest possible things spiritually; not externally, but content to realise the most wonderful things ever known by the hearts of men. Simeon was moved by the Spirit. If we cultivate what is spiritual, we shall not want 'pleasant Sunday afternoons'. They are like wine and strong drink, stimulating nature; they spoil your appreciation of Christ. I would not like anything to spoil my appreciation of Christ.
{109}
"A MAN IN JERUSALEM"
@Luke 2: 25 - 32
I have read these verses with the thought of bringing them, by the Lord's grace, into present application, for, as we know, Luke writes with method, and ever has before him moral and spiritual instruction, and not merely what is historical.
It seems to me that we have in Simeon the thought of one who was at the very centre of divine things; "There was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon". God would have us, beloved brethren, to cherish the thought of being at the centre of divine interests. Alas! our hearts are too ready to be content to be at a distance, but why should we be found at Dan or Beersheba if it is possible to be in Jerusalem? After the return from captivity "the people cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem, the holy city" (@Nehemiah 11: 1). Nine out of every ten were content to dwell in their cities away from the divine centre, and yet they recognised that Jerusalem was the favoured spot, for they blessed those "that willingly offered themselves to dwell in Jerusalem". This shows that even in times of recovery there is danger of missing the greatest privilege of the moment.
I would press on my own heart, and on the hearts of others, that we should really live at the centre of things in a spiritual sense. It cannot be denied that at the present time the assembly, and the great reality of the presence of the Holy Spirit, are the very centre of all that has divine importance, and yet how many believers live practically at a distance from that centre. It is sorrowful to think how much they miss.
This "man in Jerusalem" was marked by the fact that "the Holy Spirit was upon him". Even in Old Testament times, God called attention to certain individuals who were said to
{110}
have the Spirit, or to have the Spirit upon them. This must have suggested to every pious Israelite the possibility of such a thing. It was clearly in God's mind that His Spirit should be upon men. Thinking of those favoured men, every pious Israelite must have been ready to say, 'Would that it had been me!' But such a favour was not within the reach of all then. It was not until Jesus was glorified that the Holy Spirit became available for all who believe on Him. And this, indeed, in a much more blessed way than any Old Testament saint could know. But the very fact that it is so is intended to raise exercise.
We are told of the five prudent virgins that they "took oil in their vessels with their torches". It was *their* exercise to be thus furnished. The Holy Spirit is available on the divine side; there is no restriction, no limitation, on that side. Indeed, the Old Testament promise, quoted by Peter on the day of Pentecost, that the Spirit would be "poured out" on all flesh, showed how extensive was the thought of God. But on our side the Lord has suggested that we should "take oil" in our vessels. The Holy Spirit is the gift of God, but a gift is to be received, and many scriptures speak of the *reception* of the Spirit, and I do not think it is ever supposed that this takes place unconsciously.
What God does sovereignly is His matter; I dare say He often gives the Spirit to believers on the Lord Jesus who have had little exercise about the Spirit, but normally He would give souls exercise about this great gift, so that it is not a matter in which they have part without their being aware of it. God would have His gift valued. The Lord suggested to the woman at the well the wonderful character of God's giving, and His own giving, but He brought in a condition on her part. "Thou wouldest have asked ... he would have given". The gift of the Spirit, as announced in the glad tidings, becomes the subject of faith; that is, we come to it in the faith of our hearts that it is in the mind and love of God to give us His Spirit. So we are encouraged to put in our claim
{111}
with confidence; if we have received Christ as the gift of God we are entitled also to receive the Spirit as His gift.
But we cannot contemplate the gift of the Spirit without realising that it necessitates moral suitability on the part of the recipient. The Spirit could be upon Simeon without any incongruity; he was "just and pious, awaiting the consolation of Israel"; there was nothing about him to jar on the sensitiveness of the Spirit. If there are dark corners where unrighteousness is hidden, or if there is a lack of piety, the Spirit cannot be restful. It can hardly be said of such that their hearts are purified by faith. It must be remembered that the gift of the Spirit is the divine witness to a certain condition of heart. Peter said, "The heart-knowing God bore them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit ... having purified their hearts by faith" (@Acts 15: 8, 9). Believers are said to be "according to Spirit", and to mind the things of the Spirit (@Romans 8: 5). If we are not in moral suitability to the Spirit we may miss practically the gain of this wondrous gift.
Then Simeon's outlook was such that the Spirit could identify Himself with it; he was awaiting the consolation of Israel, he was looking for the Lord's Christ. The saints today are marked off from those in the world by their different outlook. Those in the world have no outlook that the Spirit could identify Himself with, but the saints have a divine outlook, they are looking for the coming of the Lord. That has been God's great objective ever since sin and death came in; it will bring all that is of God into the world. In Simeon's case he was, of course, awaiting the first coming of Christ; it is ours now to await His coming the second time. None are in harmony with the Spirit who are not awaiting the coming of Christ. To be out of harmony with the Spirit is to disregard His presence.
Then the Holy Spirit made communications to Simeon; He made known to him "that he should not see death before he should see the Lord's Christ". *We* are living in a wondrous time, for the Spirit is even now making communications to
{112}
the saints. In @John 14 - 16 the Lord enlarged upon the way in which the Spirit would make divine communications. Clearly this was in the first place to those who had been with the Lord in the days of His flesh, but they were of our company, and what they got was for us. The Comforter brought to their remembrance all the things which Jesus had said to them. There must have been much more in that than has been recorded in the Scriptures.
Overcomers today are marked by having an ear to hear what the Spirit is saying to the assemblies. I wonder if we are habituated to hearing what He is saying? We may be quite sure that He will never say anything contrary to the Scriptures, or that cannot be substantiated from the Scriptures, but He can bring out the mind of God in a way that never would have been gathered from the Scriptures alone apart from His speaking. The Spirit has always something to say to the assemblies. Speaking is characteristic of each Person of the Trinity, and this is in a special way the time of the Spirit's speaking. I think it possible that when the time comes for the assembly to be translated, the Spirit may communicate to many that they will not see death. One would covet to be amongst those thus favoured of God, but whether we have this privilege or it is reserved for others, let us see to it that we do get the communications which the Spirit is making. Let us consider the possibility of having communications from the Holy Spirit who is dwelling here, and who is acquainted with everything that is in the mind of God. There is no part of the will of God, or of divine counsel, that is not perfectly known to the Holy Spirit, and He is here that it may be made known to us.
But if we are to have the gain of this we must not be "scattered abroad". We must be at the centre of things. Simeon was there, and because he was there he missed nothing that was possible at the moment. He was where divine communications were not missed. A well-known servant of the Lord said that he always got things first by the Spirit, and then he
{113}
had to search them out in the Scriptures. I say this that we may be encouraged to give a very real place to the Holy Spirit, and to expect to get spiritual things from the Spirit.
Then we see that Simeon moved in a practical way under the control of the Spirit. If he had been half an hour earlier in coming into the temple, or half an hour later, he might have missed a most blessed opportunity. If we move with the Spirit and in the Spirit we shall not miss divinely given opportunities.
Simeon saw the whole salvation of God -- all that the Scriptures had spoken of for thousands of years -- substantiated in a little Child. It was no longer promises or statements of Scripture, but all that was of God was there substantiated in a Babe six weeks old! And he received Him into his arms.
There have been moments, I dare say, when we have thought how blessed it would have been to embrace that holy Babe.
But, beloved, it is our portion to do so -- to embrace Him in our affections. What appeared to be small was really infinitely great. Its outward smallness tended to hide its greatness, but it was not hidden from Simeon. He saw that all peoples were before God in relation to that Babe; the Gentiles were to come to light for blessing, and He would be the glory of His people Israel. The man at the centre could take in the whole circumference of divine thoughts.
We may be sure that those who are at the centre think much of Christ, and they think much of what is of Christ, that is, of the assembly which is His body. Christ is not now here personally, but He is here substantially in His body. The Spirit would lead us to see what is here now -- His body deriving from Him. He said to Saul of Tarsus of His suffering saints, 'They are "me"'. If we truly embrace Christ in our affections we cannot fail to take account of His body here. He is here substantially in His body. We look at every believer as of the body potentially, and we want him to be of it substantially as formed in the features and moral qualities of Christ. We do not want merely to think of the statements
{114}
of Scripture in an abstract way, but to have them brought into concrete expression in ourselves and in all saints. We can see that Simeon received very real substance into his arms, and God would have us to regard the assembly, the body of Christ, as a substantial thing, composed of persons who have very definitely derived from Him so as to be in their measure expressive of Him.
We do not wonder that Simeon "blessed God", and we may well bless Him for all that He has brought within our range. It is of all importance that we should be at the centre of what is of God. Christ and the assembly are at the centre; the assembly is the body, the fulness, the completeness of Christ. If we are really in mind and affection at the centre, the Spirit will have His way with us; we shall get communications such as no worldly or carnal believer could know anything about.
The whole moral universe comes within the scope of the communications of the Spirit, and it is the privilege of the saints of the assembly to dwell, as it were, at the very centre. Hence the apostle prayed that we might be "strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man; that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts, being rooted and founded in love, in order that ye may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height" (@Ephesians 3: 16 - 18). If Christ personally dwells in our hearts, what is of Him in His members -- His body down here -- will have a very great place with us. We shall then look at the saints according to what they are potentially, and we shall desire that what they are potentially as called ones they may be substantially as formed by the Spirit in the features of Christ. It is evidently of immense importance that Christ should come out in His body in a substantial way; that is, as morally and spiritually formed in His members here. May the Lord help us in regard to these things!

THE TEMPTATIONS (1)
@Luke 4: 1 - 13
If you speak of one being full of the Holy Spirit you regard such a person as a vessel. We all feel that we do not know much about being full of the Holy Spirit, but God would be greatly pleased to give us an impression of the character of such a man, for it is a great part of the work of God to give us an impression of the Man who was full of the Holy Spirit. This is set before us in Jesus; we see a Man upon this earth who was full of the Holy Spirit; we are introduced to such a Person as that. We all know the man after the flesh, and I hope we know him so well that we wish to have nothing more to do with him. Jesus was a divine Person in the Godhead, but we see Him here as a praying Man; He comes before us as a Man marked by absolute dependence upon God. There is nothing on the divine side to prevent us from being filled with the Holy Spirit, so that Jesus is, in some sense, a pattern of what is possible, through grace, for us. Jesus as a vessel was closed to the world but open towards God; He always looked Godward. It was a delight to God to have a Man who could withstand every temptation which could be brought against Him. He was personally a delight to God, and before He began His service He was led by the Spirit in the wilderness to be tested. The question was raised whether the dependent Man could stand where the independent man failed, and it is God's delight to show us that Jesus could stand invulnerable against every temptation Satan could bring. Jesus was full of the Holy Spirit, and a man who is filled with the Holy Spirit can stand against every temptation that Satan can bring.
Now look at the 13th verse: "And the devil, having completed every temptation, departed from him for a time". The three temptations which are here recorded comprise every
{116}
temptation. The devil may have ten thousand different ways by which he tempts man, but these three temptations cover in principle everything Satan could bring; he had no other weapon in his armoury -- he exhausted all temptations. The Spirit has singled out these three temptations as comprising every one that Satan could bring against man, and the way in which Jesus met them is a pattern of how we should meet temptation. There is a kind of man that Satan cannot touch; it is the dependent man who is full of the Holy Spirit and is in the consciousness of sonship. Power lies in seeing the place that the Son of God has taken as Man with reference to God. Christians greatly overlook this fact. They look at Jesus as the Saviour from sins, as having effected redemption, and other wonderful things, but we must not forget that He came into manhood as God's beloved Son to be the Vessel of the Holy Spirit, and to meet in that condition every power of Satan.
Tonight we look at Jesus in relation to the devil -- we have seen Him in chapter 3 in relation to God. I am deeply interested in desiring to know the kind of man who is full of the Holy Spirit; I have known the man after the flesh for a good many years. The relations which Jesus took up when here are patterns for us. There is to be a harvest for God, and every grain of wheat that will be gathered into His garner will take character from Jesus. It will as surely be brought about in every one of us as it was brought about in Him; God will realise it. As our souls come under His influence, He will work it out in us and enable us through grace to maintain such relations with Him as Jesus maintained when here on earth. God's thought for us is that we should be filled with the Holy Spirit. We see this in Him first, and in seeing it in Him we see it in absolute perfection; then we cannot happily or spiritually accept anything less.
The first mark of a man who is full of the Holy Spirit is dependence upon God, and all the exercises God puts His people through in the wilderness are to teach us that important
{117}
lesson. Man can only live by communications from God. Man is always trying to live on something that really cannot be made into food; but God is teaching each one of us that we must live on divine communications. Happy family conditions will not satisfy you: you must have something from God and then you will begin to live. Most Christians appreciate how good it is to read a little Scripture and have a little prayer before starting out in the morning. When you get something which is really food for your spirit you feel fortified, and it is really wonderful how one finds that God gives exactly what you need for the circumstances of the day. "Every scripture" is of great importance. An infidel who at one time was intimate with J.N.D. said that he had never met a man who was so purposed in his heart that not one word of Scripture should be a dead letter to him. He once asked J.N.D., 'What would have been lost had what Paul said to Timothy about bringing the books and parchments been omitted?' J.N.D. said that that verse just helped him with regard to his not disposing of his library. A sister once said to me, 'My religion is to go to meetings'. Meetings are not everything, we must have personal communications from Him, and when you receive a divine communication you then turn it into prayer. You are handling in this way a draft from the bank of heaven, and it will be honoured! God says, 'It is My currency; it bears My image and superscription and I must honour it'.
{118}
THE TEMPTATIONS (2)
@Luke 4: 5 - 15
It is a great favour from God that we should be brought to know things in divine perfection. One feels how precious it is to see all that is suitable to God without a flaw. The true character and blessedness that is our portion through Christ is patterned in Him. You see the thing perfectly patterned in Him, so we can learn our own true character, and our true place and blessedness in perfection as patterned in Christ.
Luke writes with method. There is divine method in the way he writes, and he puts things in moral order. We learn first how such a Man as Jesus lives, and then how such a Man worships and serves; and next we see the perfect way in which such a Man confides in the known love of God. Now this is the true character of our life as being of Christ, and we have to admit as believers that we are of Christ. So I have to learn my true character according to grace, in Christ. As to the life of our spirits, we live by what God has spoken to us; and this comes out in connection with the first temptation, that man lives not by bread alone but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God. We live by what God has spoken to us, and that constitutes the life of our souls; God has spoken to us in Christ, and it is what comes to us from God that constitutes our life, whether we have fed on it little or much. Every communication from God enlarges our capacity to live Godward, and it is very interesting to see this. He speaks to us so that we might live on it, and that principle runs right through the Christian's life: we live by what God speaks to us. The thought of God is that we should live in relation to Him, in the conscious appreciation of every word that He has been pleased to speak. The Lord actually did live on every word that proceeded from God's mouth -- it formed His life morally as a Man down here. We have,
{119}
*perhaps*, received very few of God's words to live upon, but they constitute the measure of our life. What we should seek to get hold of is the positive features which the temptations brought out -- they brought out positive features in Christ. As believers we are no longer listening to the serpent; those who are of Christ are closed to Satan and open to God. I should like the youngest believer to set that down as a definite spiritual fact, that he is after Christ by the grace of God. God speaks to us that we might be free to worship and serve Him.
In the first temptation what comes out is how God has moved towards man to speak to him in such a way that he can live by what God says, and the measure in which we have appreciated what God has said is the measure by which we live spiritually. But God has spoken to us because He wanted worshippers and servers; He wants us to do homage to Him, and it is His pleasure that we should serve Him.
In the second temptation we see that all the power and glory of the world's system has no attraction for Jesus, and it is interesting to note that the thought of worshipping and serving God is set against all the power and glory of the world, which would be the full scope of man's ambition as a fallen creature: God sets against it the power and glory of being able to worship and serve Him.
There is an infinitely greater power and glory in worshipping and serving God than in anything that the devil can confer. So one sees it is infinitely greater and nobler to serve Him than to receive all the glory and power that belongs to this world. This is the true way of deliverance from all human ambitions. If our hearts have fed upon what God has spoken to us we shall have affection for Him. To covet the power and glory of the present world system requires that one should become a worshipper of the devil: it demands that we shall do homage to the one who holds it out as the great prize to the ambitions of men.
How does God see us? How are we known of God? Now let each of us consider, how does God know me? If
{120}
I have believed ever so feebly and simply on Christ as God's salvation, then the way that God knows me is as one who stands in all the value of redemption, and the one who has received the Spirit, so as to be formed after Christ. God does not know me according to the flesh; He knows me in Christ. And we have to rise up to the thoughts of God. God's thoughts are that we are of Christ, we are blest through Christ, in Christ, and for Christ, and Christ is in us, and we are to be with Christ and like Christ through all eternity. We learn that the object God has in view for us is to learn an entirely new power and glory. There is power which lies in the gift of the devil, but we want nothing to do with it; we want as little to do with it as Christ did; we want no more of the power and glory of this world than Christ had. Can each one of us say, 'It is true of me through God's infinite grace'? As Christians we have a new thought of glory; we are attracted by an entirely new kind of power and glory, which the natural man never wants, but Christ wanted it and we want it.
The sanctuary is the place where God is worshipped and served, and what a mercy it is to be transferred into such a region as that. The devil has not got a jot or tittle that is spiritual; he has nothing to offer beyond death, nothing of true value.
That blessed Man of @Luke 4 was in the brightness of the sphere where God is worshipped and served in the beauty of holiness, and what belonged to the world system had not the least attraction to Him; and that should be true of everyone who has the knowledge of Him. I think the glory of doing homage to God, and serving Him, would put the glory of the world out of hearts and keep it out. The glory of the world is for a moment: there is nothing abiding, nothing of true value. That system of things has gone: it has lost its hold on our hearts, and what holds us now is God speaking to us, and we now live to God. What a moment it will be for me when I open my eyes in a scene where there is no distraction! God has thoughts about me that transcend all human conception
{121}
and I shall then know as I am known. What a comfort it is to know that we are known of God; and as such we are able to serve God, and to do homage to Him. I have had a thought from God and I have just closed my eyes and said, 'Glory to God'. That is doing homage to God.
The world is the full limit of man's ambition, but we learn there is a greater glory in serving God. He has delivered us out of the hands of all our enemies, to serve Him in holiness; He has delivered us in the power of redemption, to serve Him without fear in holiness and righteousness all the days of our lives. I came to this meeting with the thought of being spiritually enlarged. I do not believe in coming to a meeting and going out again in the same manner as I came in. The more I receive the more I can give, and I worship and serve in the light of what God has spoken to me.
The third temptation brings out the restful assurance of divine love in which the Lord Jesus was kept while here below. The devil comes and quotes Scripture, and asks the Lord to put it to the test and see if it was true or not! There is always the subtle tendency in our hearts to want proof that God loves and cares for us. The great danger is that we may be like the Jews desiring a sign; when the Lord was here, they came to Him asking for signs, and it is very often Satan's way to want us to acquire some evidence that God really does love and care for us. Christ is our evidence, and we do not want evidence of the love and care of the blessed God other than Christ.
{122}
MINISTERING TO CHRIST IN LOVE
@Luke 7: 36 - 50
C.A.C. It is remarkable that it is the activities of the woman that we see here rather than the activities of Jesus. We might say that Jesus does nothing; He is sitting at meat, and He remains sitting; all the activities are on the part of the woman. It is very sweet when such a point is reached when the Lord has no longer to be active but can be the subject of the activities that divine grace has set in movement in the heart of a sinner. This incident seems to set forth not so much the grace that forgave as the effect of that grace in a heart that had come to appreciate it.
Ques. Does this suppose that there has been a previous movement on the part of God and the Lord Jesus which this woman has taken account of? Is she responsive to the piping of divine grace?
C.A.C. Yes, I suppose so. Luke writing with method is leading us up to identification in affection with the divine testimony, and we get the climax of it in the beginning of the next chapter. Chapter 7 ought to end at the end of verse 3 of chapter 8 -- that is the end of a very distinct section of the gospel. Chapter 8 verse 4 begins another subject which one might call the public result of the word of God being preached in the world. But what comes out so beautifully in this woman is that there is a result produced in her affections which sets her in activity. I think we shall miss the point of it if we do not see that it is the activity of the woman here; the Lord is not seen in activity, the woman does everything. It leads up to this that the Lord goes through the country, city by city, and village by village, preaching and announcing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God. The twelve were with Him, and certain women and many others who ministered to Him of their substance. Is that not the climax? The kingdom
{123}
of God is composed of those who love Jesus and minister to Him; and no power of evil can touch that. Evil is completely displaced in those who appreciate and love Jesus, and are engaged in ministering to Him. If any manifestation of the power of evil comes out in me it shows that I am not in the appreciation of Jesus. No evil can touch the heart that is in the appreciation of Jesus.
The Lord's intention is that throughout the sphere of divine testimony there should be a witness to the power of the kingdom of God in every city and village. That is the form that the kingdom of God takes; it is localised in the cities and villages.
This part of the gospel is a wonderful section as bringing out the answer to what Simeon said of the Lord, "a light for revelation of the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel" (@Luke 2: 32). We see a Gentile brought into view at the beginning of chapter 7 as having a right thought of Jesus. The widow who lost her son no doubt represents Israel. Israel's hopes were all dead, but she proves the compassion of Jehovah in restoring her hopes on the principle of resurrection -- she gets her son, her hopes are restored to her. Peter talks of hopes restored in resurrection. It is a comprehensive view of what God is doing, bringing to light the Gentile and bringing Israel to light as having a right appreciation of His grace as revealed in Jesus.
Ques. Does it show the way in which God had gained the affections of His creature?
C.A.C. It is all a question of the wisdom and the counsel of God; we must take account of that. It says the Pharisees rejected or made null the counsel of God. It is not a question of meeting man's need but of carrying out the wisdom and counsel of God. It is on that line that the Gentile comes into view for blessing, and Israel gets every lost hope restored on the principle of resurrection. It is only the children of wisdom who justify the counsel and wisdom of God. If God is moving in wisdom and according to His counsel, the natural man will
{124}
never justify Him. John the baptist had to learn to justify God; he had to learn to accept his own ministry, as we all have to do when we are put in prison and get no honour at all.
We see here the greatest servant of God and the greatest sinner put side by side. The Lord said of John there was no greater born of women, he was the greatest servant of God that ever was up to that time. And we see also a woman of the city, a sinner, and both have to be brought to the point of justifying God.
Rem. The wisdom is manifested in the way God has approached man in grace.
C.A.C. Yes, and that the creature should love and minister to Him; and that is the kingdom of God. We have come into the kingdom in the measure in which we love Jesus and minister to Him. It is not working for Him -- Christendom is full of the idea of working for Him -- we can work for Him and be as legal as the day is long, but we can only minister to Him in love. To minister to Him is to do everything for Him, and that is what Simon failed to do. We are in the presence of a great profession; Jesus is in Simon's house now, in the place of great profession which pretends to honour and serve Him, but does not minister to Him. In the presence of that we have to learn to minister to Him. The kingdom of God in its vital power is known then. One covets this sweet privilege; it is put within our reach, the privilege that the greatest servant of God up to that time never had. John the baptist never had the privilege that the woman had. In that sense one could say that she was a little one in the kingdom of God and greater than John the baptist. He never had the privilege of washing the feet of Jesus and anointing them; it was not given to John in the wisdom and counsel of God, but it was given to the woman and it is given to us if we have the love to take it up. I often think the most interesting part of the gospels is the unwritten part. I should like to get alongside of this woman in the scene of glory and ask her
{125}
how she came to the appreciation of the Lord. The Spirit of God has not told us how she came to it -- that is the unwritten part -- but she did come to it. What an appreciation she had of Him! It has been called elementary, but I should be thankful if I could reach up to it a little. What a wonderful thing for the Lord to be able to say of any one of us, "She loved much". It is not that she believed or did wonderful works outside, but she loved much.
Ques. Has the Lord that in view with us?
C.A.C. Yes, I think that is it. The Lord would set up in every city and village a testimony of it. That is the true testimony of the kingdom of God. I think we see how it is worked out. Here is a woman deeply affected by the forgiving grace that was there in Jesus. The Pharisee was blind to it; all he could see was a prophet who would know a sinner when he saw her and would repel her. That was Simon's idea of a prophet, but the Lord was not like that at all. The Friend of sinners had come in and the woman appreciated Him. I believe the testimony of God in this world largely hangs on that, Do we appreciate the Friend of sinners? The creditor has come in, but as a Friend, and He is not insisting on payment, but He frankly forgives. What is most touching is that He becomes such a Friend as that at His own cost. I have no doubt that the myrrh that the woman put on His feet was suggestive that the way He was taking in grace was at His own cost.
Ques. Do you think that the woman had a previous knowledge of the Lord?
C.A.C. I do not think Scripture explains how things are arrived at, because when God works in the soul that is the mystery of the kingdom of God. The mystery is something altogether hid from view; we see the result but we do not see the process. No account is given of the process by which the woman reached the result, and it is like that with every one of us. The wisdom and counsel of God had produced fruit in this woman, for who has an honest and good heart naturally?
{126}
In the next section we get more the public result; there is only one ground that produces a normal result, an honest and good heart; that is the outcome of the counsel of God.
Grace was there for Simon as well as for the woman. In a gospel preaching the grace of God in Christ is there for everybody; but the very fact of the preaching brings to light that there is a great difference in the state of soul of those addressed. Jesus being there brought to light that there was a very great difference between Simon and the woman. The woman appreciated Him and Simon did not: the woman had an honest and good heart, the whole truth of her sinful condition was all understood and out. She was astonished at the wonderful character in which He was there; she appreciated it and ministered to Him; the Lord set all the inward affections of her heart in movement. But Simon had no idea that He was the creditor.
Ques. How can we minister to Him in a practical way today?
C.A.C. I suppose in the presence of all the self-righteous pride that marks the public profession it is our privilege to be near to the Lord, to express our appreciation of Him and lavish on Him all that our hearts have found in Him. The Lord's intent is that in every city and village within the scope of the testimony of grace there should be the witness of that. I understand that to be local responsibility.
Ques. Is that on the line of "Wisdom hath built her house" (@Proverbs 9: 1)?
C.A.C. I think so. Every element is there; there is the heralding forth of the kingdom of God, it is to be heralded forth with the sound of the trumpet. It is evangelical, men are made to feel that it is very good news. You do not insist on man's responsibility but on the setting forth of the grace of God; it is good news. Then there is the administrative authority of the twelve who were with him; that element is there. I think it shows what the Lord set up in every city and village. The testimony of God has taken that form now; it is
{127}
not centralised in Jerusalem, Rome or London, but it is set in every city and village. And then the women are there, some are named and many unnamed, and they "ministered to him of their substance" (chapter 8: 1 - 3). There was to be a witness in every place of the supreme blessedness of Jesus, that He was loved and served and ministered to. I believe that is the vital character of the kingdom of God, and it is something to be a little one in it. As to the real power of the thing, it is not only what we know of Scripture, or the path of outward separation, but what tells is that Jesus is loved and ministered to; and His heart is gratified by what He finds in those who love Him -- that is the kingdom of God in power. Wisdom's children would do right things at the right time and in the right way. Nothing is more blessed than that Jesus should be appreciated as the full expression in manhood of the forgiving grace of God.
Ques. Would love be the keeping of His commandments?
C.A.C. Yes, that is why the twelve are with Him. The twelve would seem to suggest the divine system of administration, the mark of divine authority which He set up in this world. People say they love the Lord, and are very busy working for Him, but the test would be, have they got the twelve? Do they recognise the authority which the Lord set up in the apostles? That would bring in assembly order.
Being healed of evil spirits and infirmities results in peace, and it is only in the spirit of peace that we can be identified with the testimony.
Ques. Why does the Lord bring up the question of sins with this woman when she came as one who loved Him? Is it because of what Simon said?
C.A.C. I think the Lord justified her in the presence of Simon. He told her her sins were forgiven, she got the positive word from Him that it was so -- that was confirmation. I think the Lord always gives confirmation. If there is a shadow between one's heart and the Lord there is not the consciousness of forgiveness at that moment. If I am
{128}
unforgiving it shows I have lost the sense of forgiveness at that moment. I think we get a sense of forgiveness in a general way, but it is a distinct advance to get His word personally. We might get a sense of forgiveness, but not being attached in love to the Lord we do not get the personal consciousness of it. I think there is such a thing as the Lord telling a soul that his or her sins are forgiven. It is not merely a text of Scripture, though it might arrive that way, but a distinct sense in the soul, 'He told me my sins were forgiven'. The soul knows it as a personal reality.
Ques. Do you think the woman came to the Lord with the burden of her sins on her?
C.A.C. I had thought what burdened her was an overwhelming sense of the grace that was in Him; it was that that overwhelmed her so that she forgot the Pharisee and the conventionalities that would have kept her outside, and she broke through everything. She no doubt had a sense of her guilt, but in this gospel, as we have said before, it is not that man needs God but that God needs man, and God comes out to secure the heart of man for Himself: He needs it. We may say reverently that the Lord needed love. There is a proverb that says, "He that covereth transgression seeketh love" (@Proverbs 17: 9). The Lord came to cover transgressions in order to procure love; that was His object in coming. The whole principle of Luke's gospel is that God needs man. He wants him to fill His house; He wants him to put the best robe on him and feed him on the fatted calf: He needs him in order to display the wonders of His grace in him. This woman got a sense of why the blessed God came forth in His beloved Son as Man here. He wanted her, and He came forth in the grace of forgiveness; nothing could keep her at a distance, she had become possessed of Him, she ministered to Him and gave Him pleasure. We have that privilege here locally!
This woman got outside the sphere of sin altogether; it is blessed to know that we can do that. When we love Jesus and are ministering to Him we are as completely outside the
{129}
sphere of sin morally as if we were in heaven. To keep in that attitude of soul is the true power of holiness. People talk in the religious world of holiness by faith, but holiness is not by faith but by love. Here we see a person absolutely in the sphere of holiness. We should all like to be more holy; well, this is the way to it. Luke presents this as the way that Mary Magdalene got free from the seven demons. It says, "Had gone out". Luke does not say that the Lord cast them out; they went out because no demon could stay in the heart that loves Jesus. In loving Jesus and ministering to Him, there is the true power of the kingdom and no demon can stop there, and all infirmities will be healed. We have to take this up if we suffer from a demon or infirmities; we have to take this up and see where deliverance comes in. Sin had no longer any power, so the Lord could say, "Go in peace". She was completely free from the power of sin and in true holiness, for holiness is a matter of heart.
The opening verses of chapter 8 are the public testimony to the kingdom as brought out in every city and village; the woman represents what goes on inwardly. Chapter 8 verse 4 begins a new subject; it begins with the sower going out to sow. If the word of God is sown it is a public matter. Not everyone is converted who comes under the sound of the word. Luke makes a great difference between those who come under the sound of the word and those who keep the word in their hearts. Many come under the sound of the word and bring forth no fruit for God. We need instruction in the mysteries of the kingdom of God, so that we are not carried away when we hear that five hundred people have been converted somewhere. We are not elated by that because we know that it has all to be sifted out. On the other hand we are not depressed when we find that a great deal that we thought was the work of God proves to be of no value; it does not do to be depressed by that, we must know the character of what is going on publicly.
{130}
THE FAITH PERIOD
@Luke 8: 22 - 56
C.A.C. I suppose the Lord was intimating in this incident that there would be a time of testing before the world to come would be manifested; there would be a time of 'passing over'. The Lord is not seen here as sowing. He has the fruit of His sowing with Him but He does not put the disciples in settled or stable conditions; He leads them into a ship that they might be exposed to testing, but He is with them in it. This intimates that there was to be a faith period instead of the kingdom being set up. The Lord had been preaching the kingdom of God, sowing the word of God, but now He intimates in this section of the gospel that a faith period was to come in, and that the disciples would have to pass through unstable conditions, apparently without security or protection from evil and with no active intervention on His part, because He fell asleep. They were to have a time of testing; that is the present character of things. The question is, have we confidence in the One who is with His people? We have not the conditions of the world to come, we are not on dry land yet which could speak of settled conditions, but we have the Person who can bring about all the conditions of the world to come. Have we sufficient faith in Him to be restful in the presence of unstable conditions, dangers and things that test us severely? Can we trust Him? The Lord does not propose to secure His people from storms; He does not propose at the present moment to put us on dry land. It is a matter of moving through unsettled conditions where we are exposed to danger and the power of evil.
But then the Lord sets the pattern of what is suitable under such conditions. We have been seeing more than once, and we shall see again how in this gospel everything that is right is patterned in Jesus. His being asleep was a pattern for them. It indicated that the proper attitude for them to be in was one
{131}
of restfulness and confidence. It was divinely right for Him to be asleep at that moment, and His attitude was, in pattern, the right attitude for His saints. The disciples ought to have been as restful as He was; if they had had faith in Him they would have been.
Ques. Would Peter being asleep in prison convey the same thought?
C.A.C. Yes, the storm had broken on the little ship. James had been killed with the sword and Peter put in prison; a squall of wind had come on the little boat and those in it. The Lord was with them but He did not manifest Himself; He was asleep as it were. He let Herod kill James and He let Peter be thrown into prison without any intervention.
Ques. What would be the present application of the "other side"?
C.A.C. We have not reached our destination. The destination of the saints is the world to come; that is what all Christians talk about: "the habitable world which is to come, of which we speak" (@Hebrews 2: 5). It is that order of things which is under the Son of man, under Jesus; that is our destination.
Rem. We are not to look for outward intervention today, but to be kept in peace and quietness.
C.A.C. Yes, that is the great test. I know how it tests me when squalls of wind come. It is a great thing to know that the Lord is with His people though we are in unsettled conditions, exposed to storms, and there is weakness in ourselves; such a ship as they were in was not much security against a violent storm, but the Lord was there. We have to hold to the faith of His Person. Is the Lord enough for us even if He does not apparently exercise His power? If He lets James be killed with the sword is He enough then? The Lord feels it when we cannot trust Him. It is said of Israel that they tempted Jehovah; what was the temptation? They said, "Is Jehovah among us, or not?" (@Exodus 17: 7). If we say that, we tempt Him; we have called His love in question.
{132}
Tests show whether we have faith. If the Lord was always intervening for us and swept aside any difficulty at the moment it occurred there would be no test of faith at all, it would be the world to come actually here. When we reach the world to come there will be no troubles, no sea to pass over, no boat and no storms! Most of us, perhaps, would like millennial conditions now. The Lord said His last word to us in the end of @John 16: "In the world ye have tribulation", but He says, "These things have I spoken to you that in me ye might have peace". Is He enough? or can I not trust Him unless He does something wonderful for me?
The Lord knew what He was leading them into. "*He* entered into a ship, himself and his disciples"; He knew what He was doing and He knew all the circumstances in which they would be found; He knew all about the storm that was coming. He intentionally put them in that position, but He was with them in it. Note that word, "Himself and his disciples". Let us ever think of "Himself". When afterwards He said, "Where is your faith?" it was as much as to say, 'Did you not know Me well enough to be able to trust Me in a squall of wind?' It is necessary we should know the Person who is with us. The Lord in the previous part of this gospel had been unfolding Himself as the source of every grace, and now He put His disciples in a position where it would come to light whether they had really got to know him or not. It is a question of how we know the Lord. We may think we know a good deal about Him, but do we know Him so that we can trust Him if He leaves us to face a difficulty, if He lets a squall come down, and the waves beat into the ship so that there is a real danger? Can we trust Him so that we do not wake Him up? Unbelief woke Him up, faith would have let Him sleep, and we might say would have slept with Him. We have not the happy conditions of the world to come, and we must not expect them, but we have the Person who can bring in all the conditions of the world to come, and that is greater. We have at this moment something greater than the world to come.
{133}
The previous seven and a half chapters have been enough to show who He is. How have we been using the times of ministry? For every one of us there is a time of ministry: when we were converted we began to know Him, but we are led along in grace and have been brought to know Him as we have seen in this gospel, in the way that Peter, the leper, the paralysed man and others got to know Him. The Lord gives every newborn soul food and light, and brings it into the assembly to be fed and illuminated. We learn through His own ministry the Person who is with His saints. Now have we learnt Him so that we can trust Him even at a time when He does not appear to do anything for us? The Lord has told us plainly that it is through much tribulation that we must enter the kingdom of God, and Peter says, "Take not as strange the fire of persecution which has taken place amongst you for your trial" (@1 Peter 4: 12). In those days they were imprisoned, thrown to lions and burnt to death; we have not such fiery trials as they had, but we get our testings, every one of us. But we have that wonderful Person, spoken of in @Hebrews 1 and 2, who is greater than the world to come, for He is great enough to bring it in. Are we content to have Him, and in the peace of this can we be restful and sleep even in a storm? Stephen was perfectly restful; he was able to kneel down quietly and calmly and pray for his murderers, and he fell asleep though there was no outward deliverance wrought for him. The Lord does not always intervene, and faith does not expect Him to. Did the martyrs expect the Lord to intervene and save them from a martyr's death? How many hundreds were burnt and imprisoned; they did not expect the Lord to intervene; they trusted Him and felt it was part of the witness for Him that they should go that way.
This is a wonderful instruction; we are passing over, and we have a Person with us who is going to bring in all the conditions of the world to come, but He is not always going to relieve us of our little pressures and trials; He is not always going to take us out of our difficulties, or keep the storm off
{134}
us, and faith would trust Him even then. We have a precious word in the Song of Songs: "I charge you, daughters of Jerusalem, By the gazelles, or by the hinds of the field, That ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please" (@Song of Songs 2: 7). When He pleases He will awake and quiet the storm, but let Him do it when He pleases.
Ques. Does @Hebrews 2: 9 give the key to the position, "We see Jesus ... crowned with glory and honour"?
C.A.C. Yes, that is the point. We do not see the conditions of the world to come, but if we see Him crowned with glory and honour, is that not enough? I know how it finds me out. Is it enough to see Jesus crowned with glory and honour? Is that not greater than to have circumstances changed, difficulties removed, or storms quieted? To look up and see Jesus crowned with glory and honour is always open to us. Such is the Lord's tender compassion that He often quietens the storm, but He did that here in answer to what was really unbelief; He said, as it were, 'If you cannot trust Me, I will come in and quieten the storm for you, but I would prefer that you should trust Me without any intervention'. He has done that for me many a time when I have been shaking in the presence of a ripple or two, but that is to His praise, not mine. We should honour Him now by trusting Him. He will assuredly not fail in consideration for us; He is so tender and considerate that if He sees it is too much for us, He wakes up and quietens the storm, but that is not exactly the triumph of faith. Some people can tell us wonderful stories of what the Lord has done for them, but it would be better if they could tell us how exceedingly precious the Lord Himself was to them when He did not do anything for them. J.B.S. used to say that when you sit down and talk to people the first thing they talk about is their troubles, and if you say, 'Have you nothing else to talk about?', they say, 'Oh yes, I prove many mercies'; but neither the troubles nor the mercies are Himself. When we see Jesus crowned with glory and honour we are not thinking of either troubles or mercies.
{135}
The Lord sleeping was a divine voice to the disciples, and they should have listened to it. Things are patterned for us in Him.
Ques. Would you say that Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego had faith?
C.A.C. Yes, they counted on God for deliverance, but at the same time they said, 'If He does not deliver us we are going to stand firm'. God is able to do anything, but can we trust Him when He does nothing? "Now faith is the substantiating of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen" (@Hebrews 11: 1).
Rem. Here the Lord did awake and silence the storm.
C.A.C. Yes. As we said last week, this section of the gospel looks on to the establishing of the world to come and all its blessed conditions; but the thing is to be in the faith of the Person who is able to effect full deliverance and bring in the conditions of the world to come. We have not got the conditions yet but we have the Person who is able to bring them in, and it is our true blessedness and confidence to think much of that Person. That is the present situation; it is not a time of outward intervention, but of trusting the Lord who is undoubtedly with His people. Do we want anything more?
Rem. His being asleep does not mean indifference.
C.A.C. No, it means He is not in manifested activity; He does not always do the things that we might wish to be done; He does not always change circumstances, but He overrules them all for the good of His saints and in view of His testimony. All the power of evil broke loose after the Lord went to heaven, and the storm has been raging more or less ever since, but the Lord is with His people, and faith has the privilege of trusting Him during this time of 'passing over'.
In the next incident we see that something outside the borders of Israel comes into God's account in grace. "The country of the Gadarenes ... is over against Galilee", and what is seen there sets forth the conditions of things in the
{136}
gentile world. The Lord uses this peculiar interval of passing over to land to the blessing of the Gentiles, the blessing of those in whom the full strength of evil was manifested. This man had a legion of demons -- the full strength of the power of evil was in the gentile world.
I think this incident shows how the Lord would effect full deliverance for those outside Israel and would secure restfulness and testimony among the Gentiles. He secures one to whom He became everything and He secured him in restfulness to sit clothed and sensible at His feet. The Lord was not only going to have a company of Jewish disciples, but He was going to have a witness among the Gentiles of the power of the world to come. This picture does not contemplate the world to come as actually present, for He is rejected in the country of the Gadarenes, but as being in view and having its powers manifested in the way of testimony. Christians have tasted "the works of power of the age to come" (@Hebrews 6: 5). The full power of Satan was seen in the gentile world in idolatry, licentiousness and every form of wickedness; we have only to read @Romans 1 to see the legion of demons. The gentile world was the sphere where there was nothing that was adequate to check the power of the devil. In judaism there was what was of God, and it was a protecting influence; so the Jew in a certain sense was clothed; he was not quite like the Gentile.
The Lord brought Himself to have such a place with this man that this one desire was to be with Him, but he was left in his own place for testimony. That is secured now in those who believe among the Gentiles, though in general the Lord is rejected.
There is an intimation here that the Gentiles would reject Him because they besought Him to depart from their coasts and He did leave them. People are doing that really in christendom now: they are beseeching the Lord to leave them, and He is accepting His rejection. Jesus is not wanted in Christendom any more than He was in judaism, and as He accepted
{137}
His rejection at the hands of the Jews so I believe He is accepting His rejection at the hands of the Gentiles; He got into the ship and went back again. It is intensely solemn. When the Gentiles definitely reject Him, as they are doing, He will return to bless Israel who has been prepared in the meantime to appreciate Him; they have learned to say, "Blessed be he that comes in the name of the Lord".
This is one of the most instructive sections in this gospel, and if we want to be intelligent in the mind of God we should very prayerfully consider @Luke 8. From verse 22 to the end of the chapter is one section; and it sets before us wonderful principles connected with the ways of God at the present time.
In the gentile world man was absolutely in the power of evil, but the grace of God had in view man's deliverance, and it is represented in the demoniac. We have said several times that in Luke's gospel it is not that man needs God but that God needs man, and we may say that in the fulness of His grace God needed the Gentile. It was not a sufficient end with God that the Jew alone should be blessed. The Jews alone could not fill God's house, they were not great enough; so the bondman was sent out to the highways and hedges, that is the gentile world (@Luke 14). This man never asked for blessing; it was rather the other way, but the Lord's eye and heart were upon him, and in the sovereign power of His grace He set him free. What a marvellous sight for heaven to look down upon and see Corinthians, Thessalonians, Cretans and Romans -- people, who, as we read the epistles addressed to them, we can see had been possessed truly by a legion of unclean demons -- clothed in holy garments, and sitting at the feet of Jesus! What a sight for heaven! This man had been, as we should say, beyond the pale, an utter outcast, a terror to everybody, but the power of grace subdued him to Jesus.
This gospel was written that we might know the One who has power to subdue even all things to Himself, the power which will be manifested in the world to come is being
{138}
manifested morally now in view of testimony. The Person is available in whom all that power subsists. What will He not do for us? He will deliver us as completely from the power of evil, if we let Him have His way with us, as if we were already in the world to come, so that instead of demons ruling us at their will, we shall be found clothed and sensible sitting at the feet of Jesus, loving Him, and left here in testimony for Him.
Speaking generally, the Lord is rejected in the gentile world, but He has left a witness here, and every believer is part of that witness. We are not allowed just at present to go with Jesus to the right hand of God, but we are left here in the place where we were possessed by demons to be a witness to the delivering power of Jesus.
It is solemn when people ask the Lord to depart out of their coasts. It will be actually so when the apostasy comes, but it is drawing near now and the Lord accepts it. He does not force Himself on unwilling hearts.
{139}
THE TRANSFIGURATION IN LUKE
@Luke 9: 28 - 36
Ques. What is the difference between this account of the transfiguration in Luke, and that in Matthew?
C.A.C. That is just what I thought we might look at. What Matthew presents is that God would bring the future glory of the kingdom into the present, so that what is future might be present power in our souls. It is "The Son of man coming in his kingdom" which is clearly future, but God would have it become power in our souls now and present to those who have spiritual vision.
Luke gives us the present aspect of the kingdom of God, and shows us how we shall be affected, and the kind of character that will mark us, if in the good of the kingdom. It is our side of it. In Matthew it is the divine side, majesty; He is the King. It is our side in Luke, our side as seen patterned in Jesus. In Luke He is the pattern of one who is a true subject of the kingdom.
Rem. Luke is moral.
C.A.C. It is the kingdom of God here: in Matthew the future is made present, seen in its perfection in Jesus.
Rem. It is "As he prayed" in Luke.
C.A.C. A praying Man, it is our side. That is why it is "after ... about eight days"; Matthew and Mark say "after six days". The Spirit has a reason for all these things. "Six days" seem to suggest the kingdom coming in as the seventh day in contrast to the six of man's days that have gone before it. God is going to bring in what will stand in perfect contrast to man's day. God will have His seventh day! "Eight days" speak of an entirely new beginning for God in Jesus. All the Greek letters stand for numbers, and those composing the name of Jesus make 888 - 8 intensified. That is Jesus! The beast's number is 666, all short of perfection, man's number;
{140}
but 8 speaks of the pleasure of God, all patterned in Jesus. What marks Jesus as seen in this gospel of Luke is that He is found praying seven times. For a man to be praying shows that God has His right place with him. The first element in the kingdom is subjection, involving dependence, a giving up of our own will and a sense that the will of God ought to prevail. God has His rights then, and man is in his true dignity. Any prayer not flowing out of subjection and dependence and the will of God is not worth anything. The degradation of man is that he is lawless. The first sign of a man being elevated is that he prays.
Rem. It was true in Saul of Tarsus.
C.A.C. We see in him a man subdued: "He is praying". Matthew's presentation of the Lord will subdue us. The majesty of the Lord subdues us; it is "a light above the brightness of the sun" (@Acts 26: 13).
Rem. It took seven years to subdue Nebuchadnezzar, but one flash of that light subdued Saul.
C.A.C. It took seven years in Nebuchadnezzar's case because it was not the kingdom. Sometimes God uses providences to subdue us, seven years of discipline. Saul was subdued by the majesty of Jesus. Each time it is recorded it grows with him: "A light out of heaven" (@Acts 9: 3), "A great light" (@Acts 22: 6), "A light above the brightness of the sun" (@Acts 26: 13). The longer he lived the greater his sense was of the light and of its magnitude. Saul was patterned after Jesus. Jesus is not only the King, the supreme One in the kingdom, but He is the pattern for His subjects.
There is a great need of our being subdued to the light we have; we all have light, but are we subdued to the measure of the light that has shone upon us? If we are, we are true subjects of the kingdom and we shall be marked by prayer. There are three things that man needs. Firstly, his heart satisfied -- the Ethiopian is an example of that. He had gone up to Jerusalem to worship but was going back disappointed.
{141}
Philip preaches to him Jesus; he finds satisfaction and "went on his way rejoicing" (@Acts 8: 39). Secondly, the burden of his sins on his conscience removed -- Cornelius is an example of that. When Peter reaches the point in his preaching, "That every one that believes on him will receive through his name remission of sins" (@Acts 10: 43), they all got absolution. "The Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were hearing the word". Thirdly, his will subdued. There was a terrible will with Saul of Tarsus. He had no burden on his conscience; he could say, "I have walked in all good conscience" (@Acts 23: 1); but he had an unbroken will. He needed subjugation, and he was subdued in one moment. Up to then, he was doing nothing but his own will, but one ray of celestial light shone in and subdued him. It was "according to the working of the power which he has even to subdue all things to himself" (@Philippians 3: 21). Saul is an example of how the Lord could subdue a man and the effect is that "he is praying". There is no prayer but what ascends from a subdued heart; Saul never got away from the influence of that subduing; it came in and never went out.
Rem. I suppose the will is the worst part of man.
C.A.C. It is that which rises up in rebellion. There is no kingdom of God in my soul until the will is subdued, and that is maintained by prayer; it must work through prayer. If we get away from dependence, from prayer, very soon there will be a rising up of what is not suitable to God. Dependence is portrayed for us in Jesus in Luke; "He went out into the mountain to pray" (@Luke 6: 12). Man is never so elevated as when speaking to God. If I could always have an audience with the King, I should be regarded as having great dignity. To approach God is great dignity. In human things a king ought to be a pattern for all his subjects. It is certainly so with our King. In the kingdom of God a new order of Man has come in, and is marked by prayer, "And as he prayed the fashion of his countenance became different". I wonder if we
{142}
have ever prayed until the fashion of our countenance becomes different? Through prayer the countenance of a man becomes different.
Rem. It says of Stephen that they "saw his face as the face of an angel" (@Acts 6: 15).
C.A.C. A man's spirit expresses itself in his countenance. A true man cannot put on a false face. There was no need for any moral change in the Lord Jesus, but the proper effect of prayer is patterned in Him. A man's disposition, thoughts, feelings and sensibilities are so changed that the fashion of his countenance becomes altered, and it is also true of his spirit. That is the kingdom of God; it sets God forth. With a praying man or woman the fashion of the countenance alters -- it works from inside. You get filled in with what God is, His feelings, compassion, motives. That in the heart alters a man. We are often heavy with sleep, "but having fully awoke up they saw his glory". We want fully to wake up to see the glory of that kingdom set forth in Jesus.
Rem. "We all, looking on the glory of the Lord ... are transformed" (@2 Corinthians 3: 18).
C.A.C. That is where we are put; "transformed" is the same word as is used of Jesus in @Matthew 17: 2.
Rem. "Taking Peter and John and James he went up into a mountain to pray".
C.A.C. A mountain suggests elevation, far above this world, where Jesus takes us. There is no higher elevation than to be brought up to the level of all that was patterned in Jesus. The actual transforming power is the glory, but it works through prayer. As you see the blessed shining of God in a Man -- in Jesus -- you pray about it and get changed. That is how it takes place. There is nothing more important on our side than prayer. All true prayer begins, "Let thy name be sanctified ... let thy will be done" (@Matthew 6: 9, 10). That shows that a man is subdued. The Lord certainly gave His disciples a true pattern of what true prayer is, although it was not given as a form of prayer, but all the true features of
{143}
prayer are set forth in it. I do not see much in prayer if it does not flow out of a desire that the will of God may prevail. In the path of the Lord, He had His great occasions, peculiar and distinctive moments, as we all have, and we find Him praying at all these moments: when He was baptised, when He called the twelve, on the mount, in the garden and on the cross.
Rem. "Jesus having been baptised and praying ... the Holy Spirit descended ... upon him" (@Luke 3: 21, 22).
C.A.C. There was that there which was suitable to the Holy Spirit -- suitable wood to be covered with gold.
Rem. And prior to Pentecost they "gave themselves all with one accord to continual prayer" (@Acts 1: 14).
C.A.C. They showed the same kind of spirit; they were patterned after Christ. There were ten days of prayer. It is that new thing that God has brought in. The man of sin and shame is not under His eye, but the Man of His pleasure. If the change in us comes through prayer it makes nothing of us after the flesh.
The first thing is that the "fashion of his countenance became different"; the second is "his raiment white and effulgent". "His raiment" would speak of everything about Him. With us it would speak of our habits, our associations, our relations with our brethren, our households and our businesses; it is not 'advanced truth', for the apostles wrote of it to young converts. "We used to exhort each one of you, and comfort and testify, that ye should walk worthy of God" (@1 Thessalonians 2: 11, 12).
Rem. "Let us ... have grace, by which let us serve God acceptably with reverence and fear" (@Hebrews 12: 28).
C.A.C. That would affect all your raiment. We have the great privilege of being so affected by the kingdom of God that everything about us becomes affected. One has seen it after conversion in the way one deports himself, really seeking to be brought by divine power to be in correspondence with the light that has reached him. Are we all exercised to
{144}
be in correspondence with the light? It is "from glory to glory"; you do not get on to the top step at once; it is a staircase; you get the light of the finish at the start. But you go from one stage of glory to another, adding a little more in correspondence to Christ. I want to move up that wonderful staircase of glory. John says, "Grace upon grace" and Paul says, "Glory to glory". You never become inflated; if there is a danger of it, the Lord will deal with it.
Ques. What is "prayer and fasting"? (@Matthew 17: 21).
C.A.C. Fasting is giving up something that you are justly entitled to because you are absorbed with something else. "This kind does not go out but by prayer and fasting". Fasting is necessary then, because there are two kingdoms: the kingdom of God and the kingdom of darkness. To meet the power of Satan, prayer and fasting become necessary.
Ques. Why do Moses and Elias speak of His departure (verse 30)?
C.A.C. That is a great feature of the kingdom. Moses and Elias represent those who have spiritual intelligence. It was not to be found then on earth, so the Lord introduced two from heaven. "And lo, two men talked with him, who were Moses and Elias, who, appearing in glory, spoke of his departure which he was about to accomplish in Jerusalem". They spoke of His departure, His exodus -- He was going out of everything here. It is a most distinctive mark of the kingdom; it is not atonement. Moses and Elias knew quite well in spiritual, heavenly communion with Him, that the character of the kingdom of God as seen in Him could not possibly have a place in this world which is not suitable to Him. The kingdom necessitates that you and I shall have our exodus because it is patterned in Jesus; it is not atonement or glorifying God as to sin here.
Ques. Why was there an exodus for the children of Israel?
C.A.C. Because there was nothing suitable for them in Egypt as the children of God. If the kingdom is in us and we in it, we shall go out, out from this world and out from its
{145}
religious character. He was to accomplish His departure in Jerusalem, that city of solemnities; it is from that very spot that He goes out -- that is the kingdom. The wisdom of the Spirit of God commands one's admiration.
In Luke the kingdom is patterned in Jesus; and a most important feature of it is that He goes out; you could not possibly have such a kingdom here; it does not fit. It says of Moses that "by faith he left Egypt". When? I do not know. But in his heart and mind and spirit he forsook Egypt. It was not good enough; he went out-the Spirit records it.
What makes Satan angry? It is not the reformation of the world. No! It is when people forsake his kingdom; when they leave the whole system, religious and all. In heart and mind and spirit you must go out. No one who does not go out is in the kingdom of God. Why do you go out? It is because Jesus has gone out; "He has died to sin once for all" (@Romans 6: 10) and has left all that kingdom. "Died to sin" means that the whole thing is left behind. "For sin" (@Romans 8: 3) is atonement; @Romans 4 is the "Fear not: stand still, and see the salvation of Jehovah" of @Exodus 14: 13.
"Go forward ... on dry ground" (@Exodus 14: 15, 16). You make your exodus publicly and "with a high hand" (@Exodus 14: 8), not as convicted felons.
There is a double baptism, "in the cloud and in the sea" (@1 Corinthians 10: 2). The cloud is that of the glory of God shining out in grace through Jesus. If we knew what it was to be immersed in that -- justification, peace, access, the love of God, reconciliation and eternal life -- we should not be afraid of being baptised in the sea but should have a great desire for it.
Rem. "Where thou diest will I die, and there will I be buried" (@Ruth 1: 17).
C.A.C. Our exodus is outwardly by baptism, which is a form of teaching (@Romans 6: 17), and we get the gain of it when we accept the teaching. When we have learned what baptism means, we go out under the influence of all that has come to us, "through our Lord Jesus Christ" (@Romans 5: 1).
{146}
The Israelites were prepared to go out; "There was not one feeble among their tribes" (@Psalm 105: 37). They went out in military order, "Arrayed out of the land of Egypt" (@Exodus 13: 18). It was said that "the shout of a king is in his midst" (@Numbers 23: 21). You cannot sing the song of @Exodus 15 in Egypt, but on the wilderness side of the Red Sea; and as these things have place with us we shall learn the blessedness of sonship. The reason why we do not know more of the Son's place with the Father is that we have not worked out kingdom exercises. There must be a foundation laid in the soul first before you can learn sonship.
At His transfiguration the Lord was marked by prayer, by the difference in His countenance and by His raiment becoming white and effulgent. "There was a voice out of the cloud"; the scene around fades. If we are in the truth of the kingdom of God we shall get that "voice out of the cloud".
{147}
SPIRITUAL MANHOOD
@Luke 9: 30 - 35
The thought in my mind is that our growing up to spiritual manhood is a simple matter to those whose affections are commanded by the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
When He was here the Lord was forming His disciples in the features of spiritual manhood, and the result of His influence was their coming to realise that there was no one with whom He could be compared. There was variety of opinion about Him, but here (verse 20) He challenges the disciples as to what they could say of Him. And the challenge is continually brought to us as to what our hearts can really say as to His Person. Peter says He is "the Christ of God". The Lord had an unrivalled place in their affections, and this confession was an opportunity for Him to point out the character of the testimony, to speak of that to which He was about to come. He was free to tell them of His sufferings and subsequent glory and what would involve on their part suffering and the losing of their lives for His sake, and that they would need not to be ashamed of Him or His words. That is, He was preparing their hearts for the suffering time when the features of manhood would be necessary. It is all very well to be babes, to be carried, but such are no good as support to the testimony.
So the Lord takes chosen men in this instance, and He permits them to see Him glorified, and the two greatest servants in the Old Testament, Moses and Elias, with Him glorified, speaking with Him and standing with Him. It was surely to impress their hearts with the great favour that was there. They were from day to day, from week to week, and from year to year in the presence of a light that never shone on Moses and Elias; they were more highly favoured in walking with the Son of God than these saints were.
{148}
These two men seen in glory are not occupied with it, they are speaking with the Lord of His departure that He was to accomplish at Jerusalem. That is something greater than the glory of the kingdom. They had understood God's ways with them, had come to maturity and so understood that the whole kingdom glory rested on His decease that was to be accomplished. I cannot but suggest that this is a feature of spiritual manhood.
When the disciples got the Spirit they must have loved to contemplate these two great and chosen servants of God, borne along in their ministry and prophetic word by the Spirit, so that they are in the glory in a glorified condition, not occupied with it but with what was the basis of it all. How far has the death of our Lord established itself in our souls, so that we are not absorbed with the full glory of the kingdom, but with His death? All is based on the precious and unspeakable value of his death, and it must be so if we are presented "unblamable and irreproachable", as these two men were. They had something greater in their hearts than kingdom glory -- the marvellous death through which He would bring it all about, the basis on which the world to come stands, and on which the world of bliss stands for eternity.
The vision fades, Moses and Elias depart (the kingdom glory must give place to something in which they have no part), and the cloud overshadowed the disciples, "and they feared as they entered into the cloud". They could not possibly understand it, so that it occasioned fear. But it was a blessed indication that all that Moses and Elias could know of the kingdom glory was to give place to something transcendently wonderful. They were not only shadowed by the cloud, but enveloped in it, referring no doubt to what was coming in in the ministry of Paul and John, to the economy of the Father and the Son. It was, as Peter says, "The excellent glory" -- the surpassing glory. It is the place we have in connection with the beloved Son, the place in the Father's love in association with His Son. We can understand how
{149}
spiritual manhood is necessary for it; the very perfection of it is seen in the beloved Son. But we reach it by steps: the Saviour, the Lord, the Christ precede it in our apprehension. We are to see the wonderful place of the Son in the affections of the Father, and we are called into the participation of it. John's gospel and first epistle unfold it -- John's gospel in chapters 17 and 20 leads us up to the pinnacle of it. John writes as a man, he speaks of "men", accrediting them with receiving the words He had given them of the Father. He looks at them in the new period as having the Spirit, grown up to the apprehension of the great divine thoughts.
The question is how far we are capacitated to enter into the things we have in the faith of our souls. As having our place in the economy of the Father and the Son, we have something that infinitely surpasses the kingdom glory. "The glory which thou hast given me I have given them" -- the cloud of glory envelops the saints as we enter in. It requires manhood that rises up to the most cherished thoughts of divine Persons. How marvellous that we should be able to rise up to the heights of our greatest privileges, and cause pleasure to the Father and the Son by entering into Their thoughts. May we be helped in that direction for Their praise.
{150}
"HEAR HIM"
@Luke 9: 35
There is One who has received from God the Father honour and glory. The excellent glory has uttered its delight in Him. Though cast aside as worthless by man, He is chosen of God and precious. The honour and glory that He received was not something added to Him, but the display and announcement of what He was. The "holy mountain" was in the light, and within the hearing, of heaven, and those who were there learned Christ as the Object of the Father's love and delight.
How blessed it is to be abstracted for a while from what is of man, and from the circumstances and exercises of our everyday life, and to be introduced to the Father's circle! The Father delights to communicate to us -- as to the disciples on the holy mount -- His own good pleasure in the Son of His love.
His word to us is, "Hear him", important words spoken by the Father directly to men! It is not now a question of hearing Moses or the prophets, but Christ the beloved Son, One who can tell out all that is in the heart of God. The thoughts of love that were hidden in the depths of God have found utterance in the Word become flesh. He came forth in Godhead fulness to make known all that was in God's heart and mind. The Father says to us, "Hear him". He wants us to be listening in quietness of spirit to that voice that tells us all that God is in blessing and grace for man, that tells us, too, of perfect and devoted love in Christ -- love to the Father, maintaining all His glory at infinite cost, love to the church that would go down even to death to secure and bear above His bride, love to the saints that would bear our curse and condemnation that we might be with Him in His life and have his Spirit. What a blessed, soul-transporting occupation it is to "Hear him"!
{151}
The effect of hearing Him must be to fill our hearts to overflowing. What is spoken in Christ is so great, so glorious that it must absorb and satisfy every heart that really takes it in. Not that we can comprehend it, for we are tiny vessels in the presence of such a mighty ocean of love and blessedness, but by the Spirit we do, in some small measure, apprehend it. The disciples on the holy mount were filled with fear; they did not know what to do or say in the presence of the glory. But God has given us the Spirit to form in us capacity for divine affections, so that instead of being lost in it, we might be perfectly happy and at home in a circle where the glorious pre-eminence of Christ appears. How amazing that we should be withdrawn in spirit from a restless and unsatisfied world to taste the holy joy of a circle where Christ is everything -- where we anticipate, in a feeble way, the occupations of those scenes where it will be ours 'only to adore'.
The one thing for us is to hear Him. The Father wants us to concentrate our attention on that blessed One, and to feast our souls on His love. To be near to Him, to learn what He is to the Father and what He is for us and to us, is the secret of all joy. He not only meets every need, but satisfies every desire. Indeed, He exceeds and surpasses every expectation and desire; in His presence we are more than satisfied. We cannot be dissatisfied if we are near Him. It was said to Naphtali, "Naphtali, satisfied with favour, And full of the blessing of Jehovah" (@Deuteronomy 33: 23). This is the portion of those who hear Him. The thought of what He is and of what He brings to us makes our hearts unable to contain themselves. We feel we cannot give Him worthy praise; we cannot describe His beauty or define all the blessedness that we perceive in Him.
The Father has called us to share His rest and delight in the Son of His love, and this is by the Spirit. Such is the grace and love lavished upon us. I trust it is daily more wonderful to us, calling forth deepening worship and praise.
{152}
GRACE, AND ITS EFFECTS
@Luke 10: 1 - 42; @Luke 11: 1 - 54; @Luke 12:1 - 59
We are exhorted to seek the kingdom of God; and I desire to show how the kingdom of God is established in our hearts, and the practical result. In other words, to speak of grace, and its effects in those who receive it.
@Luke 10: 30 - 37 illustrates the principle of the new covenant. The law, represented by the priest and the Levite, could not help the poor half-dead man. Indeed the only thing the law could do for a sinner was to kill him outright. The principle of grace is that God acts from Himself, and all is the outcome of what He is, and what He does.
The only thing that commended this man to the notice of the Samaritan was his need. He had brought his distress upon himself, and deserved it all, but his need became the subject of divine compassion.
I have been interested in connecting several Old Testament scriptures which have reference to the new covenant with this incident in @Luke 10. For example, in Jeremiah, God tells His people, "Thy bruise is incurable, thy wound is grievous. There is none to plead thy cause, to bind up thy wound; thou hast no healing medicines ... . thy sorrow is incurable; for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins are manifold, I have done these things unto thee". Then He goes on to say, "For I will apply a bandage unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith Jehovah" (@Jeremiah 30: 12 - 17). Then again we read that they "shall flow together to the goodness of Jehovah, for corn, and for new wine, and for oil, ... and their soul shall be as a watered garden, and they shall not languish any more at all ... . and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith Jehovah" (@Jeremiah 31: 12 - 14). All this grace is seen in "a certain Samaritan". The Son of God came here to bring all the grace of heaven to
{153}
those who had lost everything and come into the deepest misery by sin. "The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit" (@Romans 14: 17). In binding up the poor man's wounds we get a figure of righteousness, and in the oil and wine we see typified peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
Have we known what it is to taste, as this man did, that the Lord is good? "My people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith Jehovah". It was no question of what the Samaritan found, but of what He brought. All His own resources were ministered freely to the subject of His compassion. Do we know what it is to have all our need met and our souls satisfied with "the fulness of the blessing of Christ"? (@Romans 15: 29). He administers all the grace and goodness of God in perfect blessing as, in figure, Joseph did in Egypt. The moment we realise this our hearts bow before Him. The grace that is in Him wins and bows the heart, and He thus gets His place as Lord in our hearts, so that He not only commands the blessing for us, but He commands us for the blessing.
So long as we are occupied with ourselves we cannot have any true knowledge of grace. But we are entitled to turn to the Lord Jesus Christ, and to find that all the favour of God is secured to us in Him. He is righteousness for us, for He went into death to glorify God in the removal of our sins, and all our unsuitability to God as in the flesh. The effect of righteousness is peace. Every question is settled, and the Holy Spirit ever bears witness to this. God says, "Their sins and their lawlessnesses I will never remember any more" (@Hebrews 8: 12), and "Therefore having been justified on the principle of faith, we have peace towards God through our Lord Jesus Christ" (@Romans 5: 1). Knowing the fulness of grace that has come out to us, "we are making our boast in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ", so that we have "joy in the Holy Spirit". God thus brings our hearts under His own blessed sway. We come under the lordship of Christ, and are
{154}
commanded by Him. He has brought the grace of heaven to us, and in tasting that grace we touch a new life which has its spring outside everything here.
This brings us to chapter 10: 38 - 42. He commanded Mary.
The sense of who He was, and of all that He brought, was great in her heart. She knew that He was here to minister, not to be ministered to. He came into Martha's house; in that sense He came near to them in their circumstances, but His object was to withdraw them from their circumstances into the circle of divine love. Mary responded to Him; she was commanded by Him; she "having sat down at the feet of Jesus was listening to his word".
Martha was busily engaged in promoting His interests according to her own thought of what was needed at the moment, and she was annoyed that Mary did not take the same course. But the one thing needful was to obtain the knowledge of God, and Mary chose "the good part". She sat down under the shadow of Christ with great delight. I think we may say that her eye was single, and her whole body full of light. She gave great pleasure to the Lord.
The other Mary in @John 20 was also commanded by the Lord, and her eye was single. "They have taken away my Lord". He had brought the grace of heaven to her for the satisfaction of her heart, and now she was entirely commanded by Him. The world, judaism, the apostles were all as nothing to her since He was gone. And the result of her devotedness was that she was brought into the knowledge of most blessed things even before the apostles. She was sent to them with the wondrous message, "I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God".
Then in @Luke 11: 1 - 13 we see that on our side exercise is needed, of which prayer is the expression. It is need and exercise that teach us to pray. A man in real need knows how to pray, and comes to the point at once. "Friend, let me have three loaves", is a very definite petition, and expresses a distinct need. True prayer is never vague and general; it is
{155}
always definite and importunate.
Ministry and reading will not do us much real good if they do not produce exercise, and turn us to God in prayer. Christians often hear most blessed ministry without making much spiritual progress because they lack prayerful exercise. It is God's way to prepare us for spiritual blessing by making us feel the need of it. He fills the hungry with good things, and satisfies the longing soul. If God presents His own blessed things to us in ministry, it is in order to awaken exercise about them in our hearts. We have to pray our way into these things, if we desire to make them our own.
A beloved servant of the Lord, now with Christ, told me that it had been God's way with him all his life to give him definite exercise about one thing at a time, and I believe if we were more with God we should have more definite exercise. We should pray about a thing until we get it.
God first gives us a glimpse of what there is for us, so that we see there is something worth going in for. Then we have to find that our flesh is a great hindrance. Many are scarcely conscious of the evil of the flesh, because they are so little set for spiritual blessing. But if God's things become attractive to us, we soon find that there is that in us which is a great hindrance. The Lord convicts and chastens us. He brings home to us the evil of the flesh so that we may judge it, and He chastens us so that we may be morally apart from it. When we see that the flesh is a hindrance, and we desire to be free from it, God comes in to break it down. And while all this is going on we pray, because we really desire that God's work should proceed in our souls.
We are sure to get the spiritual blessings that we pray for. I might ask for something connected with this life, and it might not be God's pleasure to give it; it might not be good for me to have it. But it is God's pleasure to give me spiritual blessings, and it is good for me to have them. So "every one that asks receives; and he that seeks finds; and to him that knocks it will be opened". "If therefore ye, being evil, know
{156}
how to give good gifts to your children, how much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?"
For us who live in the Spirit's day, it is not only a question of praying for the Holy Spirit, but for things of that order -- "the things of the Spirit of God": those blessed "things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that love him, but God has revealed to us by his Spirit"
(@1 Corinthians 2: 9, 10). There is not the smallest doubt that if we go in for these things we shall get them. What we need is the single eye, the simple and steady purpose of heart. Mary had a single eye, and the man who went for the three loaves had a single eye, and they each got what they were set for. Now are we set for the things of the Spirit -- those things which are connected with a risen and glorified Christ?
If we ask for those things we shall get them, though it may be through much exercise. We have to be formed spiritually for the knowledge and reception of divine things. It is not that there is any reluctance on God's part to give these things; they are "freely given to us of God"; but it may take a long time to form us spiritually so that we may truly receive and hold them.
The Prime Minister might be asked to bestow a place in some government office on a youth, and the favour might be freely given, but the youth would have to be formed for the post in education etc. before he could enter upon it. He must be fitted to receive the gift. In like manner we have to be spiritually formed to receive those blessed things which God delights to bestow freely upon us. We cannot apprehend or appropriate, or even appreciate the things of God, except as we are spiritually formed through exercise and discipline.
The Corinthians were carnal, and were not able to receive the deep things of God. Paul had to feed them with milk and not with meat.
Now I want to say a few words as to the result which
{157}
follows from having a single eye. God enlightens us that we may become luminous for His praise (@Luke 11: 33 - 36). God gives light in the hearts of His saints that there may be a light for Him in this world. The result of tasting that the Lord is good, and of being nourished by the pure mental milk of the word, accompanied by prayerful exercise, is that we become luminous. "The lamp of the body is thine eye: ... If therefore thy whole body is light ... it shall be all light as when the lamp lights thee with its brightness".
A Christian thus luminous is clothed with "the armour of light" (@Romans 13: 12). There is that about a spiritual man which forbids the approach of evil suggestions and wickedness. Men feel instinctively that they cannot approach him with suggestions of sin and folly. They hush their lewdness and blasphemy in his presence. He is encircled by the protective power of God's light. He thus escapes many a snare that is laid for the feet of the half-hearted and the worldly believer. The life-testimony of a saint never fails to tell upon men's consciences, however much they may profess to scoff at the whole thing.
The Lord warns us against the influence of five things which ever tend to dim or extinguish the light.
Firstly, "He began to say to his disciples first, Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy" (@Luke 12: 1). The leaven of the Pharisees is the desire to appear better to others than we really are. The Pharisee is also marked by being particular and scrupulous about little things, while he neglects matters much more weighty. He also loves pre-eminence, such as the first seats in the synagogues, and covets a reputation for piety while his secret life corresponds little therewith. We need constantly to watch and pray against the spirit of all this, for it is natural to our flesh.
Secondly, there is the spirit of the doctors of the law: "Ye lay upon men burdens heavy to bear, and yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers" (@Luke 11: 46). It is so easy to lay down the law for others, and to expect more
{158}
from them than we render ourselves. The flesh finds a certain pleasure in this, but to its own condemnation. I have no moral right to claim from anybody, even in my mind, what I am not rendering myself. The great thing is to be displaying what is right, not to be demanding it. The true spirit of the Christian is not to impose burdens but to "bear one another's burdens, and thus fulfil the law of the Christ" (@Galatians 6: 2).
Thirdly, there is the fear of man: "Fear not those who kill the body and after this have no more that they can do" (@Luke 12: 4). The worst that men can do, if their enmity is allowed to go to its full extent, is to send us to heaven!
Fourthly, covetousness is a great hindrance if it gets place in our hearts: "Take heed and keep yourselves from all covetousness ..." (@Luke 12: 15 - 21). The desire to increase possessions here is a terrible blight upon spirituality; it quickly puts the extinguisher upon God's candle. It is not so much what one has that hinders him, but what he desires to have. If the heart is set upon things here the soul cannot prosper. A man's business is for discipline, that he may provide things honest in the sight of all men, not to promote covetousness.
Lastly, a saint may be hampered and hindered by fears and cares about his circumstances. This is an opposite snare to the previous one. The Lord says, "Consider the ravens, that they sow not nor reap ..." (@Luke 12: 24 - 30). If a believer gets anxious and full of care about his circumstances he cannot be shining very brightly. It often happens that believers are afraid to let their light shine for fear of possible consequences. But the God who thinks of a sparrow will not forget a saint, especially a saint who may be suffering for Christ's sake. He has put a number on every hair of our heads, and His faithfulness can never fail. In most cases, saints who are anxious about their circumstances are not in extremities, but they are afraid that they will be. David proved that Jehovah not only saved him out of all his troubles but delivered him from all his fears (@Psalm 34: 4 - 6).
{159}
The result of keeping free from these things, which tend to dim or extinguish the light of God in our souls and in our testimony, is that we are "like men who wait their own lord" (@Luke 12: 35 - 37).
{160}
THE PRIESTLY SUPPORT OF CHRIST
@Luke 10: 38 - 42
There is just one fact I would bring before you. If there is a desire to respond to the love of Christ we shall have His support.
But there are two things that hinder this: unsuitability and infirmity. If a soul is not quite sure that his sins are forgiven he is not free to respond, and if a soul does not know what it is to be delivered from the flesh he is not free to respond. By the cross all the unsuitability has been removed, the sins and the flesh. And then there is infirmity, the cares of this life. It was not unsuitability that hindered Martha but it was infirmity; the cares of this world, they weighed upon her; she was "distracted with much serving". It was no small thing to have a number of men drop in to dinner, as we might say; she was pressed by it and was not free to enjoy His company. It was a wonderful thing to have the Son of God in her house, and she was so glad to have Him there that she could not enjoy Him!
It illustrates a soul occupied with what the Lord is to us on our side. We might know His grace in coming to us in our circumstances and be so occupied with it that we are not free to enjoy His company. People say that Mary had more grace than Martha -- not a bit of it! Mary was no better than Martha. It was not the grace that resided in Mary that supported her, it was the grace in Him. It was the grace of the Lord that freed Mary. Grace resides in the Lord, its living Source; it does not reside in individuals. Mary knew how to appreciate the grace that was in Christ. Christ delivered Mary, and why? Because she was disposed to be free. There is that to notice; she made choice of His company; her heart was free and ready for it. The cares were real to her, but she had His support. She could sit down amidst it all and be
{161}
absorbed with Him. We have cares, anxieties and difficulties, beloved brethren; are we disposed to be free?
While Martha had the Lord with her in her circumstances, Mary joined the Lord in His circumstances; she is supported by His priestly grace in His company. A pious Christian knows what it is to have the Lord with him in his circumstances. A spiritual person knows what it is to join the Lord where He is, in His circle; he is so attracted to the Lord that everything else is forgotten. The Lord ministered so to Mary's heart that she forgot everything else. Do I know what it is for the Lord to minister to my heart? The Lord says, 'I will maintain her. I will see that she is not distracted'. The Lord knows how to free us from infirmity.
The two disciples going to Emmaus had a care, but deep in their hearts they had the disposition for His company, they did want to have it and the Lord knew it and went after them and made Himself known to them. And He so ministered to them that they forgot the care that had pressed them before; they forgot their own circumstances; they forgot their own circle and they went back to Jerusalem to the circle of His interest. And that is priesthood. Beloved, how much have we forgotten our own things in the desire for His company? I ask my own soul, How much am I disposed for His company? We can have it if we want it.
The Lord when leaving His disciples lifted up His hands and blessed them, and those uplifted hands have never been put down; they are uplifted still in priestly grace to enable us to forget everything but Himself. If so, we must be absorbed with His company, and He will see to it that we have it. If there is heart disposition the infirmity is not too great for the priestly grace of our Lord. May He give us to know better what it is!
{162}
THE HEAVENLY GIFT
@Luke 11:14 - 36
C.A.C. There is now the most wonderful character of giving, the Holy Spirit given out of heaven. It is rather remarkable, verse 13 might read, 'The Father who from heaven will give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him' (see note in Darby Translation). The present time is really the time of the heavenly gift.
Rem. "Every good gift and every perfect gift comes down from above, from the Father of lights" (@James 1: 17).
C.A.C. The gift of the Holy Spirit is the supreme gift.
There could be nothing greater. When the Lord was here He was acting in the power of the Holy Spirit. We see in the miracles of the Lord samples of the power of the Holy Spirit.
Ques. Is that why this circumstance is recorded directly upon the mention of the gift of the Holy Spirit in verse 13?
C.A.C. The Holy Spirit is the finger of God, "But if by the finger of God I cast out demons". In Matthew it is the Spirit of God: "But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons" (@Matthew 12: 28), showing us that the Holy Spirit is the finger of God, the mighty power of God. When the Lord was here He was bringing that power to bear upon men, "then the kingdom of God is come upon you". In every man that was healed or delivered from the power of a demon, the power of the kingdom of God was present. It was shown and proved that there was a power come down from heaven and used by a lowly Man on earth great enough to deliver man from every power by which he was acted upon from beneath.
The great sign from heaven now is the Spirit. They sought a sign from heaven. The Lord was that when here, showing how he could deliver poor man from every evil power. The Holy Spirit is the power, divine power here.
It is a most significant incident; the man was dumb.
Nothing is a greater proof of the power of Satan. He was
{163}
unable to speak to God or for Him. One of the greatest acts of power that any of us can do is to pray; the creature is thus linked with the infinitude of divine Persons. "Praying in the Holy Spirit" (@Jude 20), what a wonderful thing to be able to speak to God in the power of the Spirit! What efficacious prayer! We do not wait enough on the power of the Spirit in prayer, not allowing one's own desires to take the lead but allowing the Spirit of God to give expression to His desires in us. What a character it gives to prayer, to ask, seek and knock now in the power of the Holy Spirit come down from heaven, and be set free in our desires and speech from all that comes from beneath.
Rem. The only thing that the Lord suggests the Father giving is the Holy Spirit in contrast to the good gifts we might give to our children.
C.A.C. It is most comprehensive to have a divine Person. I have a great desire to understand the greatness of it. A heavenly gift, the Spirit, at the present time brings in the finger of God and baffles all the magicians. We are either magicians or men of God. The magicians imitated what Moses and Aaron did, "Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses" by imitation, but they could not turn the dust into gnats. They could turn water into blood and bring up frogs -- they could turn life into death and spread evil influences broadcast -- but the finger of God is needed to bring in life (@Exodus 8: 16 - 19). The Spirit of God brings in what is living; He is the power of life out of heaven. There is no greater evidence of that life than that man should speak to God and for Him. The power from beneath makes a man dumb.
Rem. We might well desire that our mouths might be opened.
C.A.C. The Spirit came down as "parted tongues" (@Acts 2: 3). It is most suggestive that it should be in that form. Upon Christ the Spirit "descended in a bodily form as a dove"; in relation to the blessed character of that Man there was dove-like gentleness. The dove is also a mourner. "I mourned as a dove" (@Isaiah 38: 14). The Spirit comes to link
{164}
Himself with Christ as a heavenly mourner here. But "parted tongues, as of fire" suggest ability to speak.
Ques. We were saying last week that we thought that asking suggested desire, seeking suggested energy of faith, and knocking suggested patience. What do you say to that?
C.A.C. It is very good. All those things need to have their place with us. Dependence is learnt from the Lord Himself: they learnt it from the Lord. The very way He prayed made them long to pray like Him.
The Lord suggests others using the same power; He says, "Your sons -- by whom do they cast them out?" There were those in Israel able to cast out demons. It is very suggestive, others are to have the power. At the present time that power is acting in the saints. There are others now, sons of men, able to exercise the power of the Holy Spirit.
Rem. Previous to this the disciples say, "We saw some one casting out demons in thy name, and we forbad him, because he follows not with us" (@Luke 9: 49).
C.A.C. A sad thing for the man.
Ques. Would "in thy name" suggest the greatness of that name?
C.A.C. It would suggest the power that there was in that name.
Rem. It would go to prove that there were those casting out demons in the power of that name apart from the disciples.
C.A.C. Many do so today, but it is a pity not to follow. What a privilege he missed, using divine power but not following. He missed the wondrous and never-to-be-repeated privilege of following the Lord with the little band knit to Him in affection. There are many like that today.
Rem. One would prefer to be a follower if it were a question of choosing between exercising power or following.
C.A.C. "If any one serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also shall be *my* servant" (@John 12: 26). The man was not where the Lord was, he was not in the
{165}
company or circle but a freelance: he was a true servant and truly using divine power but what a privilege he missed. Those three and a half years were a most wonderful moment, the Son of God walking about with His disciples, with "signs and wonders". These were the most wondrous times that the world had ever known. The man missed the greatest privilege of all. Though the Lord's power was with him, he was not with the Lord.
Ques. I suppose a crisis had been arrived at here in the Lord's ministry, when His works were attributed to the devil, so that is it a question now of being with Him, different from chapter 9: 50? Our path is more distinct than ever in view of the departure and approaching apostasy of christendom.
C.A.C. It is a great thing now to have something positive. There is a solemn warning here about being empty. It is not enough for the unclean spirit to be gone out of the house and for it to be "swept and adorned". Very often nothing more is aimed at than getting rid of gross evils, and the result is an empty house.
Ques. What does "adorned" suggest to you?
C.A.C. It suggests the outward influence of what is of God. With regard to Israel, they were not guilty of idolatry in post-captivity days -- the evil spirit of idolatry was cast out. They were very particular about the law, and services were set up. But it was an empty house. An empty house, however clean it may be, is no security. The house must be occupied; Christ and the Spirit must have Their place. If the house is unoccupied the unclean spirit can come back. He has "gone out of the man" here, not cast out, and he comes back. People get free from what is outwardly displeasing to God, but we want something positive, divine Persons having Their place with us. Peter speaks of some who "if after having escaped the pollutions of the world" are "again entangled, they are subdued by these, their last state is worse than the first" (@2 Peter 2: 20). It is the solemn result of an empty house, made very nice in a formal way.
{166}
Rem. Outward cleansing is true of christendom.
C.A.C. It is where Protestantism stopped short. The idolatrous spirit of popery went away but there is no power in that alone. As Christ and the Spirit have Their place with us there is security. Christendom cannot keep evil out; demons are creeping in denying the inspiration of Scripture, Christ's Person and the truth of the assembly.
Rem. They have no Ark.
C.A.C. That confirms what I am saying. The Lord Himself is the Ark of the covenant and our only security now is as He has His place with us. It is the very centre of everything in christianity; all centres in the Person of the Christ -- all for man's blessing and for God's pleasure. "Blessed are they who hear the word of God and keep it". Natural sentiment is set aside. If we hear the word of God now we shall get a great thought of Christ as the true Jonah and the true Solomon, and our whole body shall be full of light. If you bring light in you get rid of the darkness. There are many hymns that people sing sentimentally but they still walk with the world that does not care about Christ. It is a great thing now to hear the word of God; we shall thus find security from every sort of wicked spirit. John says, "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, if they are of God; because many false prophets are gone out into the world" (@1 John 4: 1).
Ques. What would you say was God's "unspeakable free gift" (@2 Corinthians 9: 15)?
C.A.C. All that divine grace that had come in as embodied in Christ and known by the saints in the power of the Spirit. It is the character of the giving expressed in Christ and the Spirit. It is unspeakable; that is, infinite, and it is a free giving; that is, a giving of divine Persons -- God giving His Son and His Spirit. There is an unspeakable character of it, we cannot compass it.
Ques. Would you say that the truth is presented to us objectively in Christ but that the Spirit would suggest what is subjective?
{167}
C.A.C. Both Christ and the Spirit are spoken of as being the truth. The Lord says "I am the way, and the truth, and the life", objectively; and "the Spirit is the truth" (@1 John 5: 6) subjectively in the souls of the saints. The verification of everything lies in the Spirit. When the failure came in, which was even before the apostles had gone, the remedy adopted was a falling back on the outward order. Obedience and subjection to bishops was pressed in the second century instead of exhorting to fall back on, and give place to, the Spirit. The Spirit is the security and safeguard. The bishops became like the princes of this world; there was no security there. Security is found in giving place to Christ and the Spirit. The religious world aims at having the house "swept and adorned" but there is no security in that for "the last condition of that man becomes worse than the first". It is true of christendom in its terrible apostasy, and all because the house is empty. We may find ourselves exposed to evils that we little expect if we do not, individually, give place to Christ and the Spirit.
What wealth there is in Christ as the true Jonas. Jonas is a sign to an evil generation. Solomon stands in relation to an appreciative heart; one who would come a long way to hear him.
But the only sign God has for an evil generation is the sign of Jonas. Jonas was cast out and in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights. Then, after that, he went to Nineveh and was a sign to the Ninevites. They repented at his preaching. It is a solemn thing to face the fact that man after the order of Adam has fallen and is offensive to God. He has to be cast out and completely removed from before God. The Son of man was three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. We have to learn the necessity for the Son of man to go into death. It is a very solemn thing that the Son of man has come in to take up what attached to man, and there was nothing for it but that He must be dead and buried. It is a solemn impression of Christ. Everything that I am
{168}
according to the flesh is really subject to the judgment of God. The Son of God has been into that place and has been buried. I have to learn, in the death of Christ and in His burial, my association with an evil generation. He took it up in grace -- charged Himself with it. Now there is a Man living before God for His pleasure, and that is Christ -- no other but Christ! Man after the order of Adam is gone in the death of Christ, absolutely removed -- buried -- from before God. Is that me? What a complete clearance. What do I want with religion and ordinances? Christ is the great sign of God's intervention. Then you are ready for Solomon. Jonah brings in the Son of man in relation to a wicked generation -- Christ is known in death and resurrection in connection with that generation that I belong to in flesh. What is it in view of? Solomon as King of glory. He is called Jedidiah, beloved of Jehovah. God's eternal delight is in Christ risen and glorified. The only delight God finds in me is when He sees me cherishing thoughts of Christ. There was an appreciative heart in the queen of Sheba. She came a long journey to get into contact. She represents the Gentile; "She came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon". She was typically attracted by the report of all that God has gathered up for His pleasure in a glorified Christ. We have to take that journey and leave our own greatness and glory.
Rem. The report set her in movement.
C.A.C. The Spirit from a glorified Christ in heaven has come to report His glory that we might move that way and that there may be with us a single eye and a body full of light, luminous, not hidden away but shining for everybody.
God has taken me up to make me like a glorified Christ. The house is occupied. The eye is simple. The eye is either simple or wicked; there is no middle ground. It is simple if it is really fixed on Christ. If Christ is not the object it is a wicked eye; the wrong person is in view. A simple eye recognises that everything for God's pleasure is in one Man, His own risen and glorified Son. God has attached us to that Man
{169}
that His features and qualities may be reproduced in us. If it is not Christ whom we have before us it is the wrong man. "See therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness".
Ques. Would Saul's conduct with regard to Amalek be a warning to us in that regard?
C.A.C. The whole of Amalek was to be devoted to destruction. Saul lost everything by retaining that man. He lost his kingdom and his life.
{170}
RELATIONS IN WHICH WE ARE TO DIVINE PERSONS
@Luke 12:11,12,29 - 44
C.A.C. I may say that my desire in suggesting this scripture was that we might be reminded of the relations in which we are set to divine Persons at the present time, more particularly as suggested to us in this chapter. I think we should all perceive that there is nothing of greater practical importance than to understand our relation to divine Persons and that of divine Persons to us. The scripture we have read together speaks of the Holy Spirit, the Father and the Lord. And each of us, as believers having the Spirit, is set in relation to these Persons of the Godhead, and our prosperity, our development according to God, depends upon our being true to the relations in which we are set with divine Persons.
Ques. Are you speaking of relationship?
C.A.C. No, relations: that is, the relation in which we view the Persons of the Godhead.
The Holy Spirit in this scripture teaches us how we should speak. That is the particular relation in view.
The Father is brought before us in His paternal interest and care over us and as having a kingdom that we may seek. The Lord is presented as having a household of which we are left in charge, to hold it in suitability to Himself, that He may come to it at any time that suits Him.
Those are the relations in this chapter. Firstly as to *christian speaking*, all christian speaking properly is the kind of speaking taught by the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit has come to teach us to speak. In this scripture it is brought before us particularly in regard of answering (verse 11), but I wish to speak of the general principle that the Spirit as a divine Person is given to us to teach us how we should speak. Everything that is proper to the Christian is patterned in the Lord Himself
{171}
seen in this gospel as sealed and anointed with the Holy Spirit. There was a moment when He received the Spirit. He was the Son of God, but there was a moment when He took up the place which is His in the power of the Holy Spirit. Thus the relation in which we are set is patterned in Him. We should all be ready to admit that the first way the Holy Spirit teaches us to speak is to God. He comes into our hearts as the Spirit of God's Son crying, Abba, Father -- as the Spirit of liberty in speaking to God and saying Abba, Father.
Rem. "Praying in the Holy Spirit".
C.A.C. All christian speaking is in the Holy Spirit. We find the Lord having to speak to the adversary immediately after the "voice came out of heaven, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight ... . But Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness" (@Luke 3: 22; @Luke 4: 1). We find He has to speak to the devil in the power of the Holy Spirit. That is the character of His speaking, not His own authoritative voice but the same kind of speaking as is possible to you and me. How pointed and effective His replies to the devil in the power of the Holy Spirit! We are often brought face to face with those adverse to the truth, those who are in direct opposition to what is of God. It is a comfort to know that the Holy Spirit is given to us to know how to speak to those people. The Lord used the words of Holy Scripture. That is the character of speaking to use to adversaries. There is power in it, and God supports it. The adversary knows its power. There is power in their consciences when we use the words of Holy Scripture.
Ques. Would Stephen be an example? "And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke" (@Acts 6: 10).
C.A.C. Yes. We next find the Lord in Galilee speaking to *men* (@Luke 4: 21, 22) as the anointed Preacher, the full Vessel of divine grace -- every word in the power of the Holy Spirit. We do not give place enough to the Holy Spirit
{172}
in this particular character. It would preserve us from a great deal of unprofitable talk if we considered the Holy Spirit as given to us to enable us to speak in a christian way. We are not patient enough to wait on the teaching of the Holy Spirit that it may be given "in the hour itself what should be said" (verse 12). The Spirit greatly helps in speaking. We should give more place to the teaching of the Holy Spirit as to how we should speak, and firstly to God. Very often we speak to God in a way that does not please Him at all. We get impressed with the consciousness of our weakness and failure and get shut up to selfish exercises. How do you speak to God?
I am sure you are humbled as to how much you speak about yourself. The Holy Spirit would teach you to speak to God according to the grace in which He has made Himself known to you and also of the preciousness of Christ: that is liberty. If you begin to speak to God of what you know of Christ and of His grace your heart expands immediately. You want power to judge failure. The power for self-judgment is the better knowledge of God and of Christ.
Rem. Both prayers of the apostle in Ephesians are in regard of the knowledge of God. He says, "I bow my knees".
C.A.C. The Holy Spirit would never teach me to speak but in harmony with all the thoughts of God and of the value of all Christ has accomplished. We are put on a divine platform to speak to God, to adversaries and to men. The Holy Spirit teaches and supports that kind of speaking. We are privileged to speak in a divine way (1) to God, (2) to the devil or those who are his instruments and (3) to men.
Each one of us as a believer is entitled (1) to speak to God as a son, (2) to say to the enemy, 'I am a subject one'. That silences him. The Lord was subject to the Word. People not subject to Scripture cannot use it. And (3) to speak to men. Each one of us is constituted a vessel of grace to make God known in grace to men. "And there appeared to them parted tongues, as of fire ... . And they ... began to speak ... as the Spirit gave to them to speak forth" (@Acts 2: 3, 4).
{173}
Rem. It is said of the Lord in @Acts 1: 2, "having by the Holy Spirit charged the apostles".
C.A.C. The Lord in resurrection still speaks in the Holy Spirit. When the apostle warns against "foolish talking" etc., it is in immediate connection with being "filled with the Spirit" (@Ephesians 5: 4, 18). We should speak according to God. In @Mark 7: 32 they bring to the Lord "a deaf man who could not speak right"; at the end "he spoke right" (verse 35). Would not each one of us like to be an example of speaking right according to the Holy Spirit?
Ques. Must there not be conditions with us for it?
C.A.C. The principal condition is that we should recognise the presence of the Spirit. If there is a definite recognition of the Spirit it involves the refusal of the flesh. There is power for the refusal of the flesh in the recognition of the Spirit. It is often long after the soul has received the Spirit that he recognises the Spirit as the result of the death of Christ. Every believer can say, 'Through Christ's death my sins are forgiven', but it is equally true that through death -- the death of Christ -- I have the Spirit.
In @Romans 4 we have two things brought before us: the blessedness of sins forgiven (verses 7, 8) and circumcision -- "seal of the righteousness of faith" (verse 11). Both lie in the Holy Spirit. Circumcision involves that I cannot go on any longer in the flesh; the power to cut off has come in in the Holy Spirit.
Forgiveness and the gift of the Spirit go together. God has forgiven me that He might give me the Spirit. He would so clear the believer of all imputation that He may give him the Spirit. It is the great end God has in view. So that now we are able to speak in the power of the Holy Spirit. We can all see, I trust, the important truth of christian speaking in the power of the Holy Spirit.
We come now, secondly, to *the Father*. The Lord speaks to us in a most affecting way of the Father's care and He shows us the end the Father has in view in exercising this care over each one of us -- for those who have "little faith". Many
{174}
believers have little faith as to the Father's paternal interest in us. Many take high ground, but when testing in practical life comes they have very little faith in the Father's paternal care. He feeds the ravens and clothes the lilies with glory, but no raven and no lily ever said 'Father' to Him. And the Lord says, "How much rather you?" Do we make material things our chief object? or advancement in this world? All that stands connected with food and clothing. "All these things do the nations of the world seek after". But the Lord says, 'I would give you such a sense of the Father's care that undistractedly you may seek the Father's kingdom'. How does it work? How have you seen it work? I never saw anybody seeking the Father's kingdom lacking any good thing needed for the pathway here. Have you? You have never seen it and you never will. "Your Father knows that ye have need of these things". What are we to seek? "But seek his kingdom". It is the Father's kingdom here in Luke. "It has been the good pleasure of your Father to give you the kingdom". What encouraging words for us.
Rem. It is important that we should seek it.
C.A.C. The paternal care is to set us free that we may seek the Father's kingdom. Many make their material needs an excuse for not seeking the Father's kingdom. It is a kingdom of great moral and spiritual realities. Those are the things to seek, those precious things that fill the Father's kingdom, the result of God revealing Himself in grace in His beloved Son. He will look after the temporal things if we seek the Father's kingdom. The things in the Father's kingdom are quite diverse from what is in the world. John has summed it up, "All that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world" (@1 John 2: 16). It is all outside the Father's kingdom and not to be sought after. What are His things? Learn it in His blessed Son as Man in this world. He says, "I am not of the world" and to His disciples, "Ye are not of the world", also of them, "They are not of the world,
{175}
as I am not of the world". Have you considered what it means?
"The lust of the flesh". That was not true of the Son of God. Divine love filled Him -- the contrast. No thought of gratifying self, but divine love in its ceaseless activity for the good of others. He devoted Himself in every way for the good of others.
"The lust of the eyes". The intellectual world appeals to the young -- intelligence and knowledge. They are allured by this aspect of the world. Was there any in the Son of God? There was no element of worldly intelligence but the perfect outshining of the light of the knowledge of God.
"The pride of life". This is the dominant characteristic of the world. Divine holiness marked Jesus. He was "meek and lowly in heart".
These things-divine love, divine light and divine lowliness -- fill the Father's kingdom. Seek these things. They are abiding things. Our thoughts are turned heavenward, to what is valued there. "Make to yourselves purses which do not grow old, a treasure which does not fail in the heavens" (verse 33). I had reason to buy a purse today and was told that it had 'everlasting wear'. But the "purses" we read of here cannot be bought in shops. They are only known by those in the Father's kingdom. He is delighted to give you the kingdom. Righteousness, peace and joy -- the new covenant in the knowledge of God -- eternal life -- immense things.
Rem. "Whatsoever things are true, ... noble, ... just, ... amiable, ... of good report; ... think on these things" (@Philippians 4: 8). They would be things belonging to the Father's kingdom, I suppose.
C.A.C. They abide and put us in the place of the "little flock" here. We could not be connected with anything pretentious here. Fine buildings, good singing, etc., are thought necessary to hold people, but they are out of keeping with the knowledge of the Father and His kingdom and the things belonging to it, all of which put us in the place of the "little
{176}
flock". "The little flock" is the whole company as viewed in relation to the Father's kingdom, so that no exception need be taken to the hymn book being said to be 'for the little flock'. The Father has the whole flock before Him.
Thirdly there is the relation in which we stand *to the Lord*.
We have considered our relation to the *Holy Spirit* in regard to christian speaking, our relation to the *Father* as knowing His paternal care and the character of His kingdom. Now we come to our relation to the *Lord*, and the first thing suggested is that He was going to be absent. His absence is supposed in the scripture we read. He speaks to us as those whose loins are to be girded about and whose lamps are to be burning, "and *ye* like men who wait their own lord whenever he may leave the wedding, that when he comes and knocks, they may open to him immediately" (verses 35, 36). The figure used is of a house and of a household of servants in it keeping a place of suitability to an absent lord. What a privilege and honour to be left here to keep a place suitable for Him whenever He comes. Conditions of suitability are found maintained so that there is no need for delay in opening the door. "That when he comes and knocks, they may open to him immediately". That suggests our relation to the Lord.
Ques. Would the book of Revelation suggest the same, and at the close, "Come"?
C.A.C. We could hardly have the Spirit and the bride saying "Come" without suitable conditions and all being ready for Him to come.
Ques. Is it the rapture?
C.A.C. There is nothing at all about the rapture here.
They are not looking for Him to come and take them away, but for His coming to His house, so that everything is preserved and cared for in suitability to Himself. He is so pleased that He serves them (verse 37).
This scripture suggests that He comes repeatedly -- there are repeated visits. "And if he come in the second watch, and come in the third watch" (verse 38). The "second watch" and
{177}
the "third watch" suggest repeated visits. The Lord has left His household here, and us, His servants, in charge of His household, that things may be so preserved that any time He likes to come all is suitable. When He left He meant to come repeatedly. Wondrous blessedness of it! "Blessed are those bondmen" (verses 37, 38).
The Lord is received as having obtained the object of His affections. "Whenever he may leave the wedding" (verse 36). The bride is not seen here nor in the gospels generally. We read of "the sons of the bridechamber", the "virgins", the "friend of the bridegroom", etc., but the bride herself is the great secret of the gospels; she is never seen there and she never will be seen till the Lord brings her forth Himself. The Lord is received here as having obtained the object of His affections. What a character in which to receive Him, as having secured the assembly. He comes in that character.
Rem. "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you" (@John 14: 18).
C.A.C. That is a parallel passage, and there is the orphan idea. When the Lord was here He had brought the warmth of the Father to them. In the presence of the Lord they were all the time under the Father's influence, guarded and folded up in the Father's name (@John 17). But He went away, and now He comes to renew all that blessed impression of the Father that He had made them conscious of. He comes spiritually. The Lord's supper is the Lord's knock. He says, as it were, 'I want to come in and have a place in your midst where I can serve you according to the love in My heart'. To eat the Supper rightly would secure all the conditions the Lord would desire. He comes in to minister all that the household may need at that particular time. We could not eat the Lord's supper in an unholy way. "It is not to eat the Lord's supper. For each one in eating takes his own supper before others" (@1 Corinthians 11: 20, 21). As it is the Lord's supper we should be jealous to maintain the conditions suitable to it. Great exercise is needed to eat the Lord's supper.
{178}
The title of @Psalm 24 in the Greek is "A Psalm for the First Day of the Week". The door is open for the Lord to come in, victorious in battle, Jehovah of hosts.
These are great things which concern each one of us as to how we stand in relation to the Holy Spirit, to the Father, and to the Lord as composing His household during His absence. One would earnestly seek that the Lord would work this out in our exercises to His praise.
{179}
THE YOUNGER SON
@Luke 15: 11 - 24
There is nothing more wonderful than the parables of the Lord Jesus. They are the work of a Master hand. They are such pictures as none but the blessed God Himself could have presented. They are simple and within the capacity of a child, and yet so profound and so full of divine meaning that a great intellect cannot comprehend them, nor fully grasp them.
Of all the parables this one is the crown. It is the most blessed setting forth of the heart of God that has ever been presented to creatures, and one has a certain hesitation to speak upon it. It is so exceedingly glorious and blessed that one has the fear of spoiling it, but one has confidence the blessed God can make it speak for itself. If one were not conscious that the Holy Spirit of God were here and working to make these things known in power, one would not touch the holy work of the gospel.
There are three distinct parts in this history (not connected with the elder son but connected with the younger son): departure and degradation; what went on in his mind when at the lowest point of departure; and the wonderful reception he received at the hands of his father.
It is the whole history of man as a fallen creature, and that of the work of God in the souls of men, that by which they are brought to themselves and to Him, and also the history of what God's grace delights to do for those who turn to Him.
I want you to notice that the younger son was indebted to the father for everything. Apart from the father's goodness he had nothing. All we have we owe to God -- life, strength, mind and so on. All our capacities we owe to God; all is derived from the Father. Are we using them for self and the pleasures of sin? As soon as the younger son gets his portion
{180}
he takes a journey into a far country. It is very terrible. We have departed from God. The whole of the human race takes the good that God bestows -- health, ability and so on -- and uses it all for self-pleasing. He wasted his substance. It is solemn to waste one's substance. I have often been exercised at the end of a day and said, 'A wasted day, nothing in it for God'. It is a solemn thing to waste a day but what is it to waste a life! If we have not come to God we have wasted substance. Every day has been wasted. The life of a creature away from God is all waste.
@Ephesians 2: 2, 3 is a good picture of the far country: "The ruler of the authority of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience"; all is pervaded by that influence, and people are kept away from God. They may be base or refined influences, but they keep people away from God. It is the power of Satan as the ruler of the authority of the air.
The whole atmosphere of the world is full of influences that keep people from God and cause them to waste their substance. There must come a moment in your history when you will realise that the whole of your life has been wasted because God has not been in it. It may not have been filled with terrible things, perhaps, such as would be condemned in a human court of justice, but you have been away from God, and that leads to all kinds of bad things. Read @Romans 1: 28.
It is God's not being given a place in man's heart and conscience that leads to all kinds of wickedness. They refused the knowledge of God. The younger son comes to the lowest point of degradation: he hires himself out to feed swine. The Jew knew what that meant. Swine are unclean animals; it was degrading work like @Romans 1. In Ephesians it is doing the will of the flesh and the mind pleasing self -- a wasted life.
That is the position to which man has brought himself; he does not know it. It is a strange insanity. Notice it says, "And coming to himself". The power of sin is a kind of madness; there is no madness so terrible as the madness of sin. It is departure from God. The madness of living without Christ and God in the world is an awful form of madness.
{181}
The second part of this history gives us the work of God in the souls of men. Man is in a place of distance, far from God, and in a place of degradation, and he has no sense of it. That is the moment when God begins to work. How does it happen? The influence of the father's house begins to work. A ray of light from the father's house and the father's presence shows itself in the soul. I think it is beautiful how the thought of that place from which he had departed, and of the person, comes back to him. The preaching of the gospel is to bring the light of God in goodness and love into the mind and heart of His fallen creature. The first thought that entered the younger son's mind was the thought of the goodness and satisfaction that belong to the father's house. It was, "How many hired servants of my father's have abundance of bread". That is the first thought. The first moment when God's goodness presents itself as an attraction is a wonderful moment in the soul's history.
In the natural heart there is no thought of the goodness of God -- like the elder son; he was in the far country in his mind. "To me hast thou never given", he said! That is the thought we have of God. That is the thought Satan puts in man's mind, that one has to work hard for salvation: "Thou art a hard man, reaping where thou hadst not sowed". Was he not as far away as the younger son inwardly? In the midst of the scene where the father gave everything, he turned round and said, "To me hast thou never given". He was as far from God's heart as the depths of hell are from the heights of heaven. It is a wonderful thing to get to the goodness of God. It is true: "Ye spend money for that which is not bread", but if there is hunger in the bottom of your heart, God is calling upon you to delight yourself in that which is good and satisfying. He is good enough to do it.
When we come to the third part of this history the person who fills the scene with grace and activity is the father. As soon as a soul reaches this point, "I have sinned against heaven and before thee", all depends unconditionally on what God is, and what God is pleased to do. What is God
{182}
pleased to do with a poor sinner who says, "I have sinned", and whose heart turns to God? Just think of God presenting Himself in this lovely and living picture.
"But while he was yet a long way off, his father saw him, ... and ran". In the original Greek the words "far country" and "a long way off" are the same. It was the extreme point of departure. The father saw him and *ran*. I have often heard an elaborate discourse on the younger son's return journey, but there was no journey home! It was the father's feet that covered every step of the distance. He saw him in the distance in all his rags and filth and *ran*, and fell upon his neck, and covered him with kisses. Do you believe in the presentation of God's love? God is delighted to put the kiss of His love on the poor sinner. The moment man returns to God, all depends on what God is. The moment a soul turns to God it comes into all the good of what Christ is. Before a word was said he received the kiss! The kiss is a witness of love. God wants the sinner to be conscious of His love. People say, 'How can I know that God loves me?' The death of Jesus is the commendation of God's love to the poor wretched sinner who turns to Him. He begins with the thought of the goodness and wealth of the father's house, then he says: "I perish here by famine"; he was convicted of the truth of his position. "No one gave to him"; it was an empty scene.
If we know the truth of our position we get the thought of the goodness of God. That is conversion, and divine conversion -- the turning round of the soul to God. The whole damage of the garden of Eden is undone when a soul turns to God. We then get the sense of the goodness and blessing of God and His disposition to give the very best. Is there a heart here that has had enough experience of the world to have the desire to turn to God? His work in the soul is to bring this about.
He gave His own Son as come into the world to die for sin, and "God commends his love to us, in that, we being still sinners, Christ has died for us" (@Romans 5: 8). It is the death of
{183}
Christ that the Holy Spirit uses to shed abroad in the heart the love of God. The love of God is the love of Calvary. It is where God gave His blessed Son to die. What is the measure of His love? It is immeasurable. It is impossible fully to measure the blessings of the gospel because one cannot fully measure the love of God. The love of God is shed abroad by His Spirit in the hearts of those who believe, so that the believer has a greater sense of the love of God than of anything else in the universe. It is a great thing to get the sense of the love of God. God wants us to get it.
In repentance one gets the seal of it; the kiss is for all, but only the repentant get it. The only thing the younger son has to say is, "I have sinned". Before this he had been kissed and had the seal of love on the cheek. All one has to say is, "I have sinned", not 'I have turned' but "I have sinned". One cannot be too simple. Keep on that ground, "I have sinned", and give God the glory and praise of His wondrous grace. When you get to the point of saying, "I have sinned", you have done all the thinking about yourself that is necessary. The more you keep on this ground and have done with yourself, the more you get in faith and love what the Father loves to bestow (verses 22 - 24). Every provision was made. The father anticipated the return of the younger son and made every provision for the occasion. Not only did he do this for the younger son but he did it for his own delight. There is wonderful provision in his presence. It is in Christ, in His Son, that God has made provision. All who come to Him are invested with Christ. In @Zechariah 3 we read of Joshua being invested. God wants us to be attired in festival-robes. He receives us in all the acceptance of Christ. If we are not received in Christ we are not received at all. We now live in the light and joy of Christ, the risen and glorified Man. We cannot measure the acceptance of the glorified Man, yet it is that and nothing less than that that is the acceptance of every believer. It is the acceptance of a risen and glorified Christ. "Make me as one of thy hired servants" would not have
{184}
suited the father's love. God wants us in the place of sonship, so sends the Spirit of His Son into the heart of the believer, crying, Abba, Father. The idea of eating together implies communion. Nothing will suit the heart of God but that those He blessed should be in communion with Himself. It is sonship's place. We share His thoughts of His blessed Son and feed on His perfections. That is the reception a son gets. If this does not attract us to the heart of God, what will? The gospel goes forth to make this known. There is joy in heaven and to the heart of God.
May God give each one here to taste of it

"FLEE FROM IDOLATRY"
@Luke 15: 25 - 32
The truth of fellowship involves the whole question of what our enjoyments consist in, and where we find them. God loves His people too well to allow them to have enjoyments apart from Himself.
The elder brother in @Luke 15 did not care for the merriment and rejoicing which were going on in the father's house; he had no communion with his father's delights; he had a fellowship of his own. "To me hast thou never given a kid that I might make merry with my friends". It was "I" and "my friends" without his father; he "would not go in" to take part in the communion of infinite grace. His fellowship was really an idolatrous one, for it was as much apart from his father as were the self-gratifications of the younger son in the far country.
It is against such selfish and idolatrous enjoyments that God warns us. Every ox, sheep, or goat slaughtered in Israel was to be brought to Jehovah, to the entrance of the tent of meeting, and sacrificed as a peace-offering to Jehovah. "And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto demons, after whom they go a whoring" (@Leviticus 17: 7). Any enjoyments that cannot be taken up with God, and shared with His people as in relation to Him at the altar, may be suspected as likely to open the door to what is idolatrous.
"Neither be ye idolaters, as some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play" (@1 Corinthians 10: 7). They gratified themselves in the absence of Moses, and without God. To do so is to forget that Christ has died here, and that He is absent as rejected by the world. In introducing the subject of fellowship the apostle says, "Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry. I speak as to intelligent persons: do ye judge what I say. The cup of
{186}
blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of the Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of the Christ?" (@1 Corinthians 10: 14 - 16).
In a professedly christian country we have not idols of wood or stone, but there are a thousand things which practically rob God of His place in the hearts of His people, things which have no connection with His altar and no place in the spiritual fellowship to which He has called His people. All worldly amusements have this character, and much that is connected with religion is really idolatrous, because it tends to please and satisfy men at a distance from God.
God loves His people, and would have their happiness connected with Himself. He would have each one of His people to say truthfully, 'My God, the spring of all my joys'.
Everything that truly belongs to the fellowship -- all that is of Christ and that comes to us through His death, and the holy love of God revealed to us through death -- can be shared by all who love God. If I have a source of gratification which is not the common portion of all saints, I might well ask, What is its character? What we can enjoy in common lies entirely outside of the world; it is the fellowship of the body and blood of Christ; and this puts our enjoyments on the resurrection side of death. We may enjoy together feeding upon Christ, with the happy consciousness that what we enjoy is the common portion of all who love God, and that we enjoy it as near to God and in communion with His altar.
The tent of meeting was the rallying-point for the whole congregation. It would remind us of our relations with one another. We stand committed to a holy partnership, and we have all to be true to it. Should I like to know that all saints are doing what I am doing? If not, can it be right for me to do it? If I do what is not according to the truth of christian fellowship, I misrepresent all my brethren, as well as failing to maintain what is due to the Lord. Each partner is to be a true representative of all the others. Everything that we do either ministers to the support of the fellowship or weakens it.
{187}
It is good to remember that each partner in the fellowship represents all the partners. Sometimes a believer may think he is of no account, and that it does not matter what he does, or where he goes, or how he spends his time. Each believer has been called to the fellowship of God's Son, Jesus Christ our Lord (@1 Corinthians 1: 9), and what he does is either true to that fellowship or is a misrepresentation of it; hence each should be very careful as to conduct, and should heed the injunction to "flee from idolatry".
{188}
THE SPIRIT OF LITTLE ONES
@Luke 17: 1 - 10
The Lord has been bringing before the hearts of His disciples the blessedness of God as known in grace. They had come under the influence of Jesus and had learned in Him something of the spirit of "little ones". If God is to be great, man must be small. We know that in the coming day all the greatness of man will be brought low and "Jehovah alone will be exalted in that day" (@Isaiah 2: 11), but that can be anticipated spiritually.
The Lord warns His disciples that offences are inevitable. The enemy would make persistent efforts to ensnare them, to take them away from the spirit of "little ones". The Lord's influence ever tends to reduce our dimensions, but the enemy is at work all the time to counteract that influence and to take us away from the place of littleness. Whatever does that is a snare, a stumbling-block, an "offence". A great many of our difficulties, when traced to their root, are found to arise from self-importance, but to have a sense of the greatness of God in grace is a marvellous reducer!
One feels how much we need to be exercised continually that we may be preserved in the spirit of "little ones". If we are little, there is room for God. It is a great favour to be kept small enough to give some expression of God. Such a person would manifest that a divine influence was pervading him instead of self-assertion, and he would bring in the influence of God. We should covet that.
How solemnly the Lord speaks! It would be more profitable, He says, to be cast into the sea than in any wise to be a stumbling-block to "one of these little ones"; and every true saint would say that he would rather even that should happen to him than that he should be exerting an influence counteracting the Lord's; anyone who would do it deliberately would be an adversary to the Lord and would be judged as such.
{189}
The Lord tells us (verse 3) how we may be tested. A brother who has sinned against you may be an asset if you know how to regard him rightly, for he affords a valuable opportunity for the activity of grace -- grace that can restore. The Lord supposes that one may be naughty enough to sin against you seven times in one day. If that happens to you -- it has never happened to me! -- you are to take heed that even that does not move you from the spirit of grace that marks a little one, one who is not thinking of self at all.
Of course, forgiveness is not administered until there is repentance, but it is to be in your heart; that is why you rebuke your brother, so that he may be restored, not that you may get your due. This preserves from legality. If you have to rebuke a brother it is in order to bring home to him that he has done what he ought not to have done, and there is a gracious opportunity for repentance. You do not stand off and wait for him to stoop to a low depth of self-abasement. The moment he says, I repent, there is to be free-hearted forgiveness. We might say of a person who sinned against us seven times in one day that if he had really repented he would not have repeated the offence, but the Lord says, Yes, he may! To deal with such a case makes a great demand. To rebuke one who has sinned against us, we need to be steeped in the wonderful grace of heaven, because the flesh may easily come in under such circumstances. We must own that a great deal that causes trouble amongst saints is simply self-importance, but the Lord refers here to some positive wrong having been done. It is to be met in this wonderful spirit of grace. The Lord's name would be hallowed in it, and all would be edified.
The disciples felt this to be a great test, and we may all feel, as they did, that we are not up to it. It is easy for the flesh to come in at all times, and a rebuke given in the flesh raises the flesh in the person rebuked: a rebuke given in the Spirit subdues it. There are very few Christians who could resist a rebuke in the power of the Spirit of Christ. To us naturally the effect of seeing wrong in another is to exalt self.
{190}
The Lord warns us here against what would interfere with the normal effect of the teaching of grace. That teaching would keep us very small. The trouble continually is that I am too big. It is faith we need. The Lord says the smallest bit of it -- "as a grain of mustard seed" -- would introduce a principle powerful enough to uproot all the self-importance from the heart of any man! The principle of faith is that God is great to us, and the smallest bit of the knowledge of God in grace is adequate to deal with the self-importance that is natural to man and dispose of it effectually.
Our spirits are to be governed by the light of grace which has been brought to us by the Son of God. Simple to say, but most searching in the working out of it in practice.
Faith is the light of God as known in grace, and we are to be governed in everything by the light of the dispensation. If we allow things to govern us practically which are not according to the revelation of God, faith cannot operate. If legal principles come in they are most damaging. God has discarded them as useless, and they will not work in His assembly.
The Lord warns His disciples further (verse 7) that they might even become self-important through diligence and faithfulness in service. If God allows us to do any little bit of service, and we were to do it as perfectly and as faithfully as it could be done, it is no credit to us at all. I am a bondman. If I had done everything I ought to have done, as it should be done, I am to say, 'I am an unprofitable bondman; I have done what it was my duty to do'. Personally I could not say that; very few of us could.
Our strength lies in having the greatness of God in grace before us, and the greatness of the Person in whom He has made Himself known -- no thought of honour for self at all. It must need much grace to be an abundant labourer and yet not to think that anything is due to one for what one may have done. The Lord knows what self-important thoughts come into our hearts, but His grace would enable us to judge
{191}
them in secret with Him. It is not that the Lord will not approve or praise or honour those who serve Him, but this has reference to our own spirit. What do I think of myself? I am a bondman, and an unprofitable one too!
It is all a question of what place God has with me. God is to be great, the Lord is to be great, the brethren are to be great, but I am to be small. The bondman does not seek any place or reputation; he goes on with the little bit of service he is given to do. No bondman need be jealous of another. What the Lord has set each to do is just as much as he can manage.
{192}
THE LORD TEACHING IN THE TEMPLE (1)
@Luke 20: 1 - 26
We were speaking last week of the Lord as maintaining the true character of the temple, the house of God, in spite of the state of the nation and the city being under judgment, the true character of the house being maintained by the Lord in spite of all that was public, and the true character of the temple as the place of divine light. We were thinking that this answers very much to the Lord's position at the present time; whilst the public profession of christianity is the subject of judgment, yet divine light is maintained for those who have an ear to hear, answering somewhat to @Revelation 2 and 3.
The Lord would maintain in our souls the true character of the house as the house of prayer, so that faith in God remains; whatever be the public state of things, God is available as the resource. The Lord has preserved that to us, it is preserved in the last days; and divine teaching is preserved.
God is found in these chapters: He is found teaching in the temple. The character of the temple as the place of divine light is maintained. One was thinking that that is very much how the authority of the Lord is being exercised today. His authority is being exercised, not on the line of miracles, but on the line of maintaining divine light in teaching for the people of God, so that everyone who has an ear to hear what the Lord is saying and who comes into subjection will be preserved in the secret of the mind of God in spite of all the conditions around. That is the character in which the authority of the Lord is being exercised, not exactly to put things right, but to bring out in an authoritative way the mind of God for us.
An ear to hear can only be found with a self-judged person. Only those who are in a condition of repentance, who have listened to John the baptist, will be prepared to
{193}
recognise the authority of the Lord and His teaching, because it is a question of moral discernment. It is no longer miracles. We have come to the end of miracles here in the Lord's teaching. The miracles are over; in the temple He works no miracles: He is teaching.
There is a call to repentance, showing how necessary that is in conditions which have become unsuitable to God in that which professes to stand in relation to Him. Things have become unsuitable. Repentance is the first condition; there will be no moral discernment apart from it, and the Lord does not justify His authority to persons without moral discernment. A repentant person is the first condition of assembly material.
You have at the end of chapter 19 that "all the people hung on him to hear". What a blessed attitude to be in! Self-judged; hanging on Him whose authority is exercised in the way of teaching. The whole mind of God is being brought out in the temple in the authority of the Lord at this present moment just as really as it was then. It is extremely encouraging. It is remarkable that the call to the one who has an ear, in Revelation, comes after the promise to the overcomer in the last assemblies. There is a certain quality of overcoming needed in order to give one an ear.
We should get this temple thought in our minds. It is of the greatest importance that there is a sphere where the authority of the Lord is in exercise. We recognise that those who buy and sell should be cast out; that selfish and commercial spirit has no place in the house of God, it must go. The authority of the Lord would eliminate all these elements. Then the house of God is the place of prayer. The Lord is reconstituting, as it were, the truth of the house and the temple. I think if the authority of the Lord is recognised and we are prepared to listen to Him, He would throw light on the whole situation as He is doing here, showing the character of the system of things which sets aside the rights of God, and giving a hint that there is going to be another structure in
{194}
which all the rights of God will be maintained. It surveys here the whole history of Israel and, I suppose, the whole history of man after the flesh. The principle of it is as true today as it was then. Things are taken up in self-interest, self-advancement and vain-glory in some way or another. Man is seizing on all that is due to God and investing himself with it.
I suppose the vineyard would indicate a place where God bestowed care and made provision that there should be fruit for Him. Israel was the vineyard. The principle of it would apply to that which comes under the cultivation of God, what is committed to man's responsibility: the principle would apply to the christian profession.
I think it is suggested here that God is not going to abrogate His rights: He will secure them. The subject is not developed, but the reference to the corner-stone is a hint which suggests that there is going to be a structure, a building, and in the Lord's mind all that was involved in that was present. It was going to be a structure in which all that was due to God and suitable to God's testimony would be fully maintained. It shows the entire failure of man after the flesh to render what was due to God, and his entire rejection of every gracious approach of God to him, so that even the beloved Son, the One whom God speaks of as "my beloved son: ... they will respect him", even that only brought out more the spirit that was there.
One is struck in looking at these closing chapters of Luke, how the rights of God get great prominence. The grace of God has been magnified exceedingly earlier in the gospel, but at the end the rights of God are very much insisted upon. The authority of the Lord is being exercised now in order to bring about a result for God, so that all that is due to God, all that He could delight in, should be fully rendered.
It is a great thing to respect the Heir. If we respect Him we are morally separated at once from all those who reject Him; we are not of that company at all. Hebrews is largely to teach us to respect Him, and in that way you have material for the
{195}
house of God -- persons who respect the Heir, the beloved Son. They are living stones really; they are suitable to be brought into connection with the corner-stone.
I thought we see the truth of "upon one stone are seven eyes" (@Zechariah 3: 9) here. That is, the Lord is viewing everything. His eyes are surveying the whole position, and He is bringing in divine light on every phase of the position. There is no idea in the mind of the Lord at the present time to improve things at all. I believe the utmost thought with men is to improve things, to get things put into a little better shape; but then the Lord has nothing less before Him than that all shall be according to the pleasure of God.
We come under the teaching of the Lord and His authority; it is now expressed in teaching, not in working miracles. Men are being deceived today by miracles, but the authority of the Lord is known in teaching, and in His teaching He does not allow anything that is one whit lower than the full thought of God. Well, it brings us to a very spiritual order of things -- One who teaches from the standpoint of all that is due to God -- and that is what we have to do with now. We look for great things. Though governmentally we have to pay tribute to Caesar, as it were, yet everything that is due to God is maintained.
This section really begins with the Heir being secured, so that all that is kingly is secured, but not at all in a pretentious way; the colt represents how the rights of God are carried in testimony at the present time; there is nothing pretentious, but they are all maintained, and maintained in the presence of hostility. It says that they feared the people, and it is exactly the same today. Religious leaders are no more favourable towards the testimony of God now than they were in the days of the most violent persecution, but God has ordered it that there is a spirit abroad among the people which will not suffer it, and His own are preserved. He is exposing that they have no moral discernment, for along with the greatest pretensions to increased light, there is on all
{196}
hands a tremendous increase of uncertainty. Whilst there is a great pretension to increased knowledge, there is a greater feeling of not knowing than there ever was before, so that they are being compelled to say in all quarters that they do not know. There is no moral discernment, and nothing can be asserted with any definiteness. The only definiteness now is found with the divine Teacher and the rights that He maintains in the temple. What a contrast there is between the certainties that we enjoy together and all the mixture and uncertainty which is around us in the religious world! That is the way the Lord is exercising His authority. The very fact that there is the maintenance of the mind of God in teaching is the present exercise of the authority of the Lord, and the more we come under subjection to Him, the more we shall increase in our knowledge of God and in all that is suitable to God in His house.
We ought to be conscious of the extraordinary place we have through the favour of God, and it should be a real exercise with even the youngest amongst us not to miss the divine teaching and not to be carried away by anything, however pretentious, that does not bear the impress of the Lord's teaching in the temple.
There is a general impression about that rights belong to Christ. That is why there is power in the confession of Christ, because if any of us says, 'Jesus is Lord to me', it smites through the conscience of the other person. The other person thinks, 'He ought to be Lord to me'.
I do not think there is anything authoritative now but what takes its character from the authority of the Lord. The authority of the Lord was the authority of obedience and dependence. He would not tell these men the source of His authority because they were morally incapable of understanding it. The source of His authority was obedience and dependence, and only persons on that line were capable of understanding it. Authority is preserved amongst the saints and in the assembly exactly on that same principle: obedience and dependence. There you have divine authority, just
{197}
the opposite from self-assertion. The Lord does not exactly assert His authority here; it is felt rather than asserted. His adversaries felt it; they spoke of authority; He did not.
What does not correspond with Christ has to be broken. I am referring to the stone which tests everything; what does not correspond with Christ is either broken or ground to powder. There is nothing left that you can build with, and that is the result of the rights of God being maintained judicially. The rights of God are maintained judicially, the man after the flesh with all his pretensions is ground to powder. I suppose the stone has not yet fallen on people to break things judicially, but a great number through many centuries have been stumbling over Christ and been broken. They stumbled, being disobedient. Disobedient ones stumble over Christ, showing how the spirit of subjection is so necessary. The whole position is set forth here that Christ is rejected, He is refused by the builders, "cast away indeed as worthless", Peter says (@1 Peter 2: 4). We are face to face with that system of things; we once belonged to it, were part of it, but now that through grace we are brought to respect the Heir, we are face to face with a whole world that rejects Him and that cannot fit Him in in any way, and so they cast Him away as worthless. And in that way we really come to Him as the living Stone: that is how we come to the part of this new structure in which all the rights of God are maintained. So you get the holy priesthood offering up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ, and the royal priesthood, a people for a possession to set forth the excellencies of God; everything is maintained for God. It is all involved in this rejected stone being the corner-stone.
I think He is the Ornament. @Isaiah 4: 2 tells us that He shall be "for excellency and for ornament". God says, 'I have got a structure of which He is the ornament and the bond which unites together all those who have an appreciation of Him'; and in that structure everything that is for His pleasure is maintained. You feel it is worth going in for.
He is chosen of God and precious; there is a definite issue
{198}
raised. He is cast away as worthless by men, but he is chosen of God and precious, and He becomes the preciousness to those who believe; they are governed by Him and find their place in relation to Him; they become capable of rendering to God what is due to Him, and find their delight in doing it.
Peter proposes all this to newborn babes. So that the youngest should take an intense interest in it and see the blessedness of it. He that has an ear -- that is the key to the position. The 'tribute' would suggest the conditions in which the testimony is found in the last days. The very fact of paying tribute to Caesar was the evidence that the rights of God -- what was due to God -- had not been maintained. No one felt the domination of Caesar as the Lord did. He submitted to it, and in His submission the will of God was carried out. His very birth took place as expressive of submission to the alien power which was in authority under the government of God. He comes in, as it were, in that very attitude of submission to the authority. The whole condition of the christian profession now, the subserviency, and the domination of the world, is the result of what is due to God not having been maintained. We cannot ignore it, and the Lord would have it to be recognised; but then He puts alongside it the rights of God, and whatever the conditions which have come in governmentally are, they do not diminish the rights of God. So that though the people of God are suffering governmentally through the past failure to maintain what is due to God, the rights of God are still maintained by the Lord; and we have not to wait, so to speak, for Caesar to be dispossessed, we have to maintain the rights of God now whilst submitting to the governmental conditions which have come in, but not surrendering one whit of what is due to God.
{199}
THE LORD TEACHING IN THE TEMPLE (2)
@Luke 20: 27 - 40
C.A.C. The place that these two chapters 20 and 21 have in the gospels is very distinctive. They show us the Lord teaching in the temple. His service of grace amongst men was over. That is, we get no miracles of healing after this, except the healing of a man's ear which Peter had cut off, but we find the Lord giving the temple its true character as the place of divine teaching.
I suppose the object of this gospel is to make us temple-dwellers. It leads to that point. The Lord's disciples are found "continually in the temple". The gospel is designed to bring us to that, and as being there, we are to be fully acquainted with the mind of God. The mind of God is known there. In @Psalm 27: 4 David speaks of inquiring of Jehovah in His temple. Chapters 20 and 21 are the two temple chapters in the gospel. The Lord is not seen as teaching there before. Divine light is thrown on some of the most important questions, and divine teaching is given to us.
Teaching is greater than meeting our need. The latter is our side. The Lord as teaching brings us to the mind of God about things. The mind of God seems connected with the temple. It is the place of divine teaching: "He was teaching day by day in the temple" (@Luke 19: 47).
The selfishness which blinds man to the perception of that which is of God is displaced. Room is then made for the mind of God to be made known.
One of the greatest subjects that Scripture presents to us is resurrection.
The idea of the temple has not been set aside or discarded; God never disposes of any thought that He introduces, but carries it through; none of His thoughts have lapsed. He
{200}
would have us to be temple-dwellers like Anna, "who did not depart from the temple" (@Luke 2: 37).
The great blessing to the overcomer in Philadelphia is, "Him will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more at all out" (@Revelation 3: 12). God would have us dwell where His mind is known. The Lord's teaching in the temple covers the whole range of subjects upon which it is important to have the mind of God. There is a holy sphere, apart from the world, where God's saints are able to approach Him and learn His mind. That goes on. "Ye are the temple of God". In the temple all holy subjects are understood. "The temple of God is holy" (@1 Corinthians 3: 16, 17) -- there is no room for the mind of man which is essentially unholy. Holy, uncorrupted thoughts are to be learned in the temple. One would desire to value more and more the temple character and the teaching belonging to it.
God has before Him to bring in what is wholly spiritual; His pleasure is found in that. The Sadducee is the man who refuses all that is spiritual, "neither angel nor spirit" and no resurrection. Only the natural is admitted in his mind. If only the natural is admitted, when a man dies that is the end of him. It is a dreadful form of blindness not to be able to entertain the thought of anything spiritual. The thoughts of the Sadducee were formed on the line of what was natural.
Rem. The Lord does not argue with them.
C.A.C. A sharp contrast is drawn by the Lord between "this world", that is the natural, of which marriage is the most distinctive feature, and "that world" in which the natural has no place at all. If we really understand this, we shall see clearly the difference between that which is temporal, under death, and that which is eternal, out of death and for ever for God's pleasure in resurrection. That is a very precious, divine instruction for us.
Ques. Who are "they who are counted worthy to have part in that world, and the resurrection from among the dead" (verse 35)?
{201}
C.A.C. Nothing is going into God's resurrection world but what is suited to be there -- only spiritual features; every saint goes in as worthy to be there. In this particular teaching the saints go there as having spiritual features. How could anyone not having spiritual features be happy in a spiritual realm? He would be quite out of place, and there would be no pleasure for God in it. All are certainly going to be raised, but the wicked are raised for judgment. The Lord would have us cultivate the features suitable for the resurrection world. We all have features which are suited for the natural, but through grace we may gain spiritual features.
It is true that the thief on the cross went to paradise, cleansed from all his sin, but he had spiritual features too. That is clear enough, for he condemned himself, and that is the mark of a spiritual man. He had a great and high appreciation of Christ. It would be impossible for God to leave out of His world a man who appreciated Christ. He had a great sense of grace, and was the one solitary confessor amidst the darkness of Calvary while the Lord was alive upon the cross. He stands out before the universe to confess the Lord's kingly rights and it was as a spiritual man that he went to paradise. That man must be raised; a man like that could not be left in his grave.
Rem. The apostle Paul is an example of a spiritual man in @Philippians 3: 10, 11.
C.A.C. Quite so. He was fully and earnestly set for it and intent on gaining the spiritual world and being fit to be in it.
Rem. It requires a great deal of displacement in us for that.
C.A.C. What God brings in in His grace and in Christ is quite adequate to bring in the displacement. He brings in the displacing power for it.
The thought of resurrection, as presented here, goes so far as being the means of our becoming like angels. It does not say like Christ but "equal to angels", because it is something
{202}
to be coveted. We used to sing of desiring to be like an angel; it is a spiritual desire, because angels are wholly spiritual beings. @Psalm 104 speaks of God, "Who maketh his angels spirits". The elect angels have never known the natural; they are beings of a spiritual order, wholly spiritual. The Lord presents it to us as a wonderful thing, that we shall be wholly spiritual.
Ques. Is the next thought, "sons of God", higher?
C.A.C. Yes, "being sons of the resurrection", outside the touch of death, and "equal to angels". What an elevation of rank! It is immense! You go up to a higher range. It is elevation in rank, "sons of God, being sons of the resurrection".
Ques. Are not the angels spoken of as sons of God?
C.A.C. Yes. There is a point of sympathy clearly in Scripture between angels and men. Angels are our fellow-bondmen, that is a point of sympathy between us; an angel is an obedient and happy servant of the will of God; if I am, there is thus another point of sympathy between us; they are also holy; if I am, I am in line with the angels; and as far as I am spiritual, I am in line with an angel.
Ques. What is meant by "sons of the resurrection"?
C.A.C. It is a very striking word. It would seem that men only reach what is before the mind of God for them as being brought forth in resurrection. God is going to secure everything for His pleasure in resurrection. God has outwardly lost everything that He brought into the world, even Christ, all has gone down into the grave. But all He brought in in Abraham (calling), Isaac (promise) and Jacob (discipline) is not lost but exists again in resurrection. It looks as if it were lost and that all had gone into the grave. But it is nothing of the kind. They lived for God hundreds of years after they were buried. It was the sure pledge that they would come out of their graves. It is a death-blow to the belief held by the Sadducees.
Ques. What does verse 38 mean, "For all live for him"?
C.A.C. It is a general statement. Men have not disappeared
{203}
in God's account, and that involves resurrection. That is a sufficient proof of resurrection. All those who have been put into the graves are coming out. Resurrection does not refer to a man's spirit. The spirit of a saint is with Christ. 'We put his body in the grave' we hear brothers say. That is not how Scripture speaks, for it says, "And pious men buried Stephen". They buried Stephen; we bury the *saint*, and that *saint* will be raised. "Come see the place where the Lord lay"; the Lord was identified with His body by the angels. Every saint in the mind of God is identified with his body. In the point of view of resurrection, J.N.D. is in his grave but he is coming out of his grave.
Ques. What happens to "the spirit" of a saint?
C.A.C. His spirit (viewed from that aspect) departs to be with Christ. From the standpoint of resurrection, Scripture identifies the man with his body, "the dead in Christ". There are many graves well known to the angels; they are marked spots in heaven. Two graves may be near one another, one the grave of a brother or sister who died in Christ, the other that of an unbeliever. There is an immense difference between the two. We can say of the one, 'Our brother lies there'. It is one aspect of the truth that we need to remember. That man who lived for God and for Christ is buried; he is in his grave and, in the faithfulness of God, it is *impossible* that he be left in his grave. Resurrection is a fine thing! Never listen for a moment to people who want to argue about resurrection. "Fool" says the apostle in @1 Corinthians 15: 36.
The Lord brings all this out to us in His teaching in the temple; is it not a comfort to us all? What a comfort to think that the moment the breath goes out of a believer's body, he has done with all the complications and only that which is spiritual goes into God's world.
Cultivate the spiritual! That alone subsists for God's world. Let us cultivate the spiritual; the natural is only for a moment, the little time that remains to us!
{204}
SOME THOUGHTS ON RESURRECTION
@Luke 20: 29 - 39
We have an unfolding of the truth of resurrection in these verses, and this is of the utmost importance, as it is in resurrection that God permanently secures all that is for His own pleasure. There is a resurrection world which the Sadducees knew nothing about; all their thoughts were formed on the model of the present world. There are two worlds; the world of the natural and the world of the spiritual. The Lord would lead us into the light, faith and spirit of the spiritual world. That world is going to abide untouchable by death, and beyond its power.
The Sadducees did not get beyond the range of the natural. The most prominent and characteristic feature of this world is that its sons marry and are given in marriage; its distinctive feature is the natural, and the Sadducee cannot see beyond that, he cannot see the spiritual. If there is nothing but the natural, there is nothing for the pleasure of God, for death is on the natural; the fairest and most lovely thing in nature has come under death.
Now the Lord would lead us away from the natural into the spiritual. Resurrection brings us into an order which is entirely spiritual. It is good to entertain the thought of what is spiritual, for nothing will go into God's resurrection world but what is spiritual. No one will be there who is not worthy; there will be no unworthy material in that world, "but they who are counted worthy to have part in that world".
Every spiritual element which God has introduced into this world is material for His resurrection world; the natural contributes nothing to that world. Our great concern should be to be developed in the features that will secure our being counted worthy for the resurrection world.
{205}
The Lord speaks in verse 37 of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. God had introduced in these men elements suitable for His world, and they had apparently been lost, for the men in whom they had appeared had died and been buried. They could not be really lost because God must have every element of His spiritual work in His resurrection world.
The natural appeals to us very strongly, but if we come under the teaching of the Lord He will cause the spiritual to appeal to us more powerfully than the natural. The Lord would have us walk in the light and faith of resurrection even while we are still connected with the natural.
One feels the great importance of cherishing this thought of being counted worthy of that world; it raises the question whether we are cultivating features which God must have in His world. The thief on the cross judged himself and vindicated Jesus, and he acknowledged that all the kingdom rights belonged to Jesus. These were spiritual elements which God could not leave out of His world. If one is able to see the blessed character of God's grace as it is available for sinful men, that is a spiritual element, however small it may be. People think they are going to be together in families in heaven as they were on earth, taking up old links, but that is entirely natural.
The power to see what is of God is a spiritual element which goes along with new birth, the ability to see God's kingdom. There is no question of growth, or formation in connection with seeing; a babe a day old can see, and the ability to see what is of God is an element which God must have in His world in a resurrection condition. He is going to gather it all up, nothing goes into His resurrection world but what is fit to be there, and the fitness is acquired now. I trust we desire to be more worthy of that world where all is spiritual. Those who are worthy are elevated to the rank of angels, to the rank of beings who are wholly spiritual.
We should be more exercised to be spiritual than to enjoy the happiest natural relationships. In the resurrection world
{206}
there is no more death, we are going to be equal to angels. We do not often talk of being like angels, but the Lord does here. "Equal to angels" is the character of being, and "sons" is the relationship in which the being is set. It has pleased God to have certain beings who are wholly spiritual, "who maketh his angels spirits" (@Psalm 104: 4). Even our bodies will be spiritual in the resurrection world, and it is important to see that the Lord Jesus as teaching in the temple would put an impression of that world on us, so that we should not be henceforth dominated by the natural, but by the spiritual.
Resurrection unto life is a question of personality; it is those who have practised good who have part in it (@John 5: 29). To practise good is a spiritual element, and God wants that for His world.
The thief on the cross was wonderfully honoured. In that supreme moment when the Son of God was on the cross, he was singled out to confess the Lord in circumstances of extreme outward reproach. What a place he had, what a confession! He was surely the object of admiration of all heaven. He had a unique place of confession, as completely vindicating the Lord, and investing Him with all the glory of the kingdom at such a moment. God could not leave such a man as that out of His world. So with everything that is the fruit of grace, it is all needed for God's world; that is why the saints have to be raised, there is that about them which God cannot do without in His world.
From the point of view of resurrection the saints are not viewed as being in heaven, but in their graves; the Lord says, "All who are in the tombs shall hear his voice, and shall go forth" (@John 5: 28, 29). Abraham is in his grave from the point of view of resurrection as are all the other saints who have died. God worked in those subjects of grace and produced in them spiritual elements, but the natural was there too, and they died. So apparently and publicly God lost all these spiritual elements, for the saints have died and been buried and are still in their graves. They went down, so they
{207}
must come up. The person is identified with his body in Scripture. "Pious men buried Stephen"; and the angel said, "Come, see the place where the Lord lay" -- He was identified with His body. At the end of Matthew's gospel there was a singular public witness to resurrection power having come in; "Many bodies of the saints fallen asleep arose, and going out of the tombs after his arising, entered into the holy city and appeared unto many" (@Matthew 27: 52, 53).
The bodily condition suited to God's world is brought about by resurrection; the saints are going to be raised in a condition wholly spiritual. We get the thought in @1 Corinthians 15 of what is sown; that implies that whatever the condition in which the sowing takes place there is seed suitable for resurrection.
One regards the saint's body as the temple of the Holy Spirit; it has been dedicated to God and presented a living sacrifice. There is a holy character about the body of the saint, inasmuch as it is a vessel of the activities of the Holy Spirit. There is a moral and spiritual identification between what is sown and what is raised; the believer put in the grave comes out, and comes out in a condition wholly spiritual, and it is good to seek that order of things now. "To them who, in patient continuance of good works, seek for glory and honour and incorruptibility" (@Romans 2: 7). To be seeking incorruptibility is to be seeking what is outside the natural altogether; it is wholly spiritual. Paul was earnestly set for it, "If any way I arrive at the resurrection from among the dead" (@Philippians 3: 11).
Death having come in as a blot on God's creation, it has to be removed publicly by resurrection. In @1 Corinthians 15 there is no mention of going into heaven; my impression is that the object of the apostle was to lead the hearts of the saints into a spiritual sphere so as to wean them from the power of the natural. Resurrection is marked by incorruptibility, glory and power; it is a spiritual condition. The Spirit of holiness places man outside all that is corrupting; it has
{208}
been verified in the Lord Jesus; He has been "marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead" (@Romans 1: 4).
That the spiritual is greater than the natural is one great point of temple teaching. If we were more in the light and faith of resurrection we should think more of what is spiritual, more of what is angel-like. Think of spiritual and holy beings whom it has pleased God to maintain by His election -- for we read of the elect angels -- beings who are able to participate in the delights of God's grace, and who are taken into confidence as to His activities in grace. Angels are the willing and happy servants of the will of God, and are in every way on spiritual lines. What a character of being to resemble!
Being spiritual lies at the basis of being sons of God. "Equal to angels" is the nature of the being; then there is the wonderful relationship, sons of God and sons of the resurrection. The pleasure of God will be permanently secured in a deathless scene, a scene that is wholly spiritual. Think of the blessedness of it! If we have known it, even for half a minute, when we were really in the Spirit and absorbed with God and with Christ, think of it being perpetuated in God's world in incorruptible conditions! We shall indeed have a greater intimacy with the blessed God than ever angels had. The apostle Paul longed for the resurrection state: "If any way I arrive at the resurrection from among the dead". He was pursuing it, leaving the natural behind, the whole energy of his being reaching out after what is wholly spiritual.
The Lord does not speak in @Luke 20 of the resurrection of any but saints, but in @John 5: 29 He says that those who have done evil will go forth from the tombs, "to resurrection of judgment".
{209}
NOTES OF A READING
@Luke 20: 39 - 47; @Luke 21: 1 - 38
Ques. Is there any link between the raising of the relationship of Christ as the Son of David, and the blind man who calls on Him for relief in the end of chapter 18?
C.A.C. Well, I think there was a link, but it would seem that the Lord's intention was to enlarge greatly the truth of His Person. It was a great thing that the blind man should recognise Jesus as the Son of David, the Messiah. He recognised Him as the One who had opened the eyes of the blind. It was commonly taught by the Jewish rabbis that the opening of the eyes was a miracle reserved for the Messiah, reserved for the Son of David. The Old Testament Scriptures which speak of the opening of the eyes of the blind clearly refer to the days and the power of the Messiah, so that the blind man had the faith of that. He had the faith that Jesus was the Christ, the Messiah. No one else could open the eyes. But did you not think that in this temple instruction the Lord's desire was to give great enlargement to that thought? The scribes and the Pharisees had the thought that the Messiah would be the Son of David, and the blind man had got so far as recognising that Jesus was the Messiah, the Son of David. It would appear that as teaching in the temple the Lord would give great enlargement to the thought of His greatness.
Before passing judgment on the temple the Lord gave it its true character as the place of divine teaching. He was just about to pass judgment on it and to say that not one stone should be left upon another. You see, in the sense in which the Lord is found in the temple it is the public side of things. It is not exactly the shrine, it is the public side of things. Before the Lord concluded His ministry of grace to men -- which is the theme of Luke's gospel -- He gives the temple its true character as the house of prayer, and the place of divine teaching,
{210}
and so divine light is thrown upon the greatest questions that were exercising faith, and exercising the minds of the people generally. Because what you find is that all the people are in the temple. They are all listening, not only the disciples, but all the people are there, showing that this is a public aspect of things. And I think divine teaching is public. It is not confined to the disciples, but it is public. As the Lord says, "And in secret I have spoken nothing" (@John 18: 20). The Lord publicly vindicates the truth in respect of divine authority, and in respect to the rights of God, to the government of God and to resurrection; and now, having disposed of these questions, He Himself raises a matter which was far greater than any of the others, the matter of the greatness of His own Person. 'Son of David' was not a title great enough. It was a wonderful and blessed title, but it was not great enough.
'Son of David' does not describe the true greatness of His Person.
Rem. I thought that it was evidently a crisis when the Lord raised this question; the crisis of the whole life on earth.
C.A.C. Yes, and it was the most important question that the Lord had ever propounded. As we get in another gospel, "What think ye concerning the Christ? whose son is he?"
(@Matthew 22: 42). It surpasses in importance all the other subjects upon which the Lord had thrown divine light; and the Lord does still publicly throw divine light upon every question; He maintains the temple character of things publicly and I believe He will do so to the end. There will always be, as long as the saints are upon the earth, a public maintenance of teaching in regard to every subject that men have to consider relative to God. I do not think the Lord is ever going to allow that to lapse. That is not what we enjoy privately, but it is public and it is for all the people to listen to.
Rem. That seems to be very fine in connection with the present questions amongst the saints.
C.A.C. Yes, the Lord allows questions to arise, and questions relating to the Lord's Person are the greatest and most important that can ever be raised. Men think they
{211}
are unimportant, matters of opinion, matters that are not practical, but that shows that men think of things entirely from their own standpoint. When we begin to think of things from God's standpoint the question of the Person of Christ is the great question. Every other question sinks into insignificance in the presence of the matter of the greatness of the Person of Christ.
He has many titles, Son of David is one of them, but even such a blessed title as Son of David is not great enough to bring out His proper personal glory, and so the Lord raises the question. He does it suggestively. He does not do it dogmatically by saying all that He might have said; and the Lord likes to suggest thoughts to our minds for us to work them out for ourselves. That is the way of the Lord's teaching. He suggests a thought so that we may follow it out and work it out and reach the completion of it for ourselves. He would rather that we did that than that we were spoon-fed all the time.
Rem. I have been struck lately how little the Lord speaks of Himself personally.
C.A.C. Yes; He raises the question of the consideration of Scripture. That is how the Lord would help us; by turning our attention to what has been said in the power of the Holy Spirit. In another gospel He says, "David himself said speaking in the Holy Spirit" (@Mark 12: 36). Now what has been said in the Holy Spirit is worth attending to. We shall never get on to a wrong scent if we pay attention to what has been said in the Holy Spirit. We shall get divine thoughts and we shall get them according to divine measurements too, because it is one thing to have a divine thought, and it is quite another thing to have it according to divine measurement. We often have the right thought, but not the right measurement. It is rather like the man who said that the water wagtail was a magpie. He had the colours right, but did not know the size of it! But when you come to think of the Person of Christ, that is of all importance. Not only have I got the right thought, but have I got it in its due proportions -- in its
{212}
magnitude? The scribes and the Pharisees could see, they had got their Bibles, chapter and verse, Christ is the Son of David. Well, the Lord says, stop a minute; listen to what David says about Him, "David ... calls him Lord" (@Mark 12: 37). Then He must be something more than Son of David. No man would call his son his Lord. The Lord says, think about it; and He left them thinking about it, and some have been thinking about it ever since.
Nothing is of more importance than to see that whatever titles the Lord has -- and He has many -- whatever dignity He has and whatever offices He fills, the greatness and glory and majesty of His Person give character to every one of them. So that we have no right thought of any single character or office which the Lord fills unless we hold it in our minds in connection with the proper greatness of His Person, His glory as a divine Person -- as God. There is what He is essentially and personally: He is a divine Person -- He is "over all, God blessed for ever" -- and whatever offices He takes and whatever title He wears we have always got to hold it in connection with that fundamental truth of His Person; and I think that is very helpful to see in connection with the exercise that has been raised recently in a public way. These questions have been raised before all christendom now. The Messiah had a dignity in relation to David which was greater than being his Son. He was his Son, He came into that place. He was of the seed of David according to the flesh. He was raised up of David's seed according to promise. It was written that He should sit on the throne of His father David. But then He had a greater dignity than that -- He was David's Lord. And that really involves the whole sacred mystery of the incarnation.
I think the Lord indicated in the previous section that God was going to secure everything on the platform of resurrection; everything was to be retained permanently for God on that platform, even Christ Himself. Publicly God had lost everything that He had ever brought into the world, but He
{213}
was going to lose Christ too. That is, all the men of faith had gone into death and been buried, and Christ was about to go into death and to be buried. But the Lord brings out the great truth that nothing was really going to be lost; all was going to be secured in resurrection. The sons of God would be sons of the resurrection; they would be set up in perpetuity of holiness. But everything depends upon Christ; nothing that is secured for God in resurrection could be secured apart from Christ, so that the final and great question is that of the greatness of Christ. As we know, He was "marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead" (@Romans 1: 4). Resurrection declared Him to be Son of God; it declared the greatness of His Person.
Ques. Do you connect this with @Isaiah 61: "The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon me"?
C.A.C. Well, there He is seen as Jehovah's anointed Servant, and He is seen in that character through this gospel very clearly. He is the anointed Vessel of grace. But then behind all that is the truth of His own Person. So that we find, as recorded in this gospel, that though He comes in of the seed of David according to promise, yet He comes in in an altogether miraculous way; He comes in as conceived in the power of the Holy Spirit; not born in any natural way, but coming in by a divine conception, so that He is a divine Person come in flesh. So that "the holy thing" that should be born was to be called Son of God. Therefore, He had a dignity far surpassing that of David. A son in Scripture is not regarded as being his father's equal, but in the Lord's case He was David's Lord: not only his son, but his Lord. He was greater than David inasmuch as divine glory attached to Him. He was One for David to worship and to adore.
Rem. One would like to have some sense in one's soul what it must have meant to the Lord when He repeated to the scribes, "Sit at my right hand".
C.A.C. Yes, surely, and it covers the whole present
{214}
period; the "until" has stretched out a long time as we speak -- nearly two thousand years -- and it is the great distinctive feature of the present time that the Messiah, after being rejected on earth and put to death, is exalted to the very highest place in the universe, sitting at God's right hand; everything must be subdued to Him; everything adverse must be His footstool -- that must be so -- but His greatness comes out in the place where He sits. He sits at the right hand of God, as @Hebrews 1 says, He "set himself down". That is more wonderful still. He "set himself down on the right hand of the greatness on high" -- He did it Himself. Not only that, God calls Him to sit there. But in His own personal greatness He set Himself down there. What a Person!
Rem. He delights in hearts that accord Him that place.
C.A.C. Yes, indeed. If we accord Him that place we shall be too much out of love with the man who likes long clothing and chief seats for him to be prominent and bring himself into evidence. That is the religious man. How petty and how mean and sordid the religious man looks, if you have had a vision of the greatness of Christ.
The Lord does not need to give you an extended picture of it. The Lord came into the place of the Son of David, but we can all see clearly that in doing that He came into a place that was in itself less than His own full personal glory. We can see that Son of David would not describe His full greatness. He came into that place, but He was greater than the place He came into. Now we may also say that as to His title Son of God, He was found here as Son of God in manhood, but even that great and glorious title, far surpassing as it does the Son of David, does not cover the full glory of His Person.
So that when we think of the proper glory of His Person, we have to think of Him as in absolute equality with God, and as being God. He was on equality with God; so that He did not need to snatch at it, or reach after it as if it were something above or beyond Him. It really and essentially belonged to Him, because He was God. Therefore if you
{215}
think of Him in His proper dignity and glory you rise above even the thought of Father and Son, because there is disparity between Father and Son. The Son is never looked at in Scripture as being on an equality with His Father. The terms are not co-equal; they are relative, but not co-equal. In Scripture the thought of a son is first that he is begotten; then he comes under the care and instruction of his father, and under the obedience and service of his father, and he is a pleasure to his father because he serves him and he loves his father; and the quality of love in a father is different from the quality of love in a son. It must be so, because love in a father is conjoined with authority. Love in a son is conjoined with obedience. It is so all through Scripture, so that there is a certain subordination with a son. He serves his father. That is the idea. The Lord has come into a place where He is the object of the Father's love and He receives everything from the Father in subjection and obedience, and He pleases the Father in everything that He does. He completes the wonderful services which the Father entrusted to Him. He takes everything from the Father. Now, there is not quite coequality in that. The Lord is in a place of subjection, receiving all from the Father, and doing all for the Father, and finally is glorified by the Father. The Father does everything for Him. But when you go right back into the truth of His Person He is absolutely on equality with the other divine Persons, and you could not carry the thought of Father and Son into that because there is not equality between father and son; they are never supposed in Scripture to be relationships that are on absolute equality. You would upset the whole teaching of Scripture to think so. The wonderful thing is that the One who was so great, so majestic in His own Person, who was God, as Scripture says, and in the form of God, should come into the place and into the relationship which was characterised by obedient affection and subjection to the will of the Father, and that He should carry that right through; and it is all magnified before our hearts as we think
{216}
of the greatness of the One who came into that place. It all belongs to the transcendency of His stoop of grace, so that we may know God. So that really the truth of the Lord's Person is the greatest truth in Scripture.
Ques. What is meant by the expression "sons of the resurrection"?
C.A.C. It seems to me that Scripture makes it clear that the Lord came in the depth of His love into the place of sonship in view of men having the place of sonship. It says, "God sent forth his Son, come of woman, come under law, that he might redeem those under law, that we might receive sonship" (@Galatians 4: 4, 5). That sets out the place that God's own Son was found in, in view of bringing men into sonship.
And this was to be of an eternal order. It was really secured in Christ in resurrection. It was all there in His Person before death, but then it was not permanent after the flesh. Death came in upon it. But in resurrection things take a permanent character, and they are going to take a permanent character in the sons of the resurrection. That is a blessed thing, so that the sons of God are sons of the resurrection. Paul says, 'That is what I am set for', "If any way I arrive at the resurrection from among the dead" (@Philippians 3: 11). So that the result will be in full answer to the original thought of divine love before the foundation of the world. We were chosen in Christ that we might be holy and without blame before God in love, and were marked out for sonship through Jesus Christ. That is the end that God had in view when He sent forth His Son; the Son accomplished redemption and He is raised and glorified, and He is going to be the firstborn among many brethren, and all the many brethren will be sons of God. And they will be sons of the resurrection too. God will triumph in that way. But the Person who did it all is no less than God.
He is, as one of our hymns now says, 'of full Deity possessed' (`11:2), and that is the greatness of His Person.
Yes, there is nothing more precious than that we should get a true thought of the greatness of Christ. It is greatly to be desired. A simple and humble soul, with no learning of
{217}
this world at all, who has a true, even if feeble, sense of the greatness of Christ, is most acceptable to heaven: heaven delights in such a soul. And so you find that such a soul as that can be commanded. We could not have a true sense of the greatness of Christ without being commanded by it.
So that the poor widow comes upon the scene as far greater in the estimation of heaven than the temple and all the consecrated gifts. Not one stone was going to be left upon another in the temple. All that public system was going to disappear, and all the right gifts which men had ostentatiously given were going to disappear. But this poor widow brought something there that was an imperishable adornment of the temple, and which will have its place in the eternal temple. She had an appreciation of the blessed God. That was more to God than all the costly gifts that Solomon presented when the temple was consecrated. I suppose it was the best day in the history of the temple! And the Lord would not have missed for anything being there to see those two mites, which is a farthing, thrown into the treasury. It was worth coming from heaven to see a woman who was so dominated by devotion to God that all her living went into the treasury of God. What a spectacle for angels and for the blessed God Himself! Now, morally, that is the result of apprehending the greatness of Christ. The result is, if we get the right thought of the greatness of Christ, well, He is worthy of the utmost devotion of every heart that knows Him. And so this woman, this great figure, is a greater figure in the history of the temple than Solomon. What was thought of her?
You can fancy the condescending smile with which the officiating priest would regard this insignificant trifle. Probably they thought, 'What a foolish woman, she needs it herself, and it is nothing in this pile of treasure -- it is nothing'. They might have smiled as they saw it, but with a smile of contempt. But that which was contemptuous in their eyes was the wonder of heaven. God had succeeded in proving before the universe that He could make a human being love Him with heart, soul, mind and strength, and give all to Him.
{218}
God's great triumph! The temple had to come down after that! It had served its purpose. No wonder that no stone was to be left upon another. Sometimes when a thing reaches the climax of its glory, it goes. God has no object in further retaining it.
Ques. What will produce widowed hearts?
C.A.C. Well, she had a profound sense of God's sufficiency, acquired through experience of having nothing but God. It is wonderful to have nothing but God, and to find that He is sufficient, to find that in saying 'nothing but God' you have just said everything. I have heard an old sister say, 'I have no resource now but the Almighty', as if she was very badly off! It is really laughable, but that is your heart and mine.
Ques. I wondered if this was the climax of @Isaiah 61?
C.A.C. Yes, I think it is a climax. I think the Lord reaches a climax here. It is very interesting to see the steps.
You get prayer characterising the temple. Prayer is man in complete dependence on God. And then you get the assertion of divine authority in the way of grace, and on that basis you get the maintenance of all the rights of God as seen in the vineyard which is now entrusted to us; it is given to others; it is given to us to maintain all the rights of God. And then we are to recognise the government of God whether in the world or in the church; we have to recognise the government of God and to be humbled as to it. At the same time we are not to surrender the rights of God, notwithstanding His government. You see everything secured in resurrection for God, and everything resting on the greatness of the Person of Christ, and then you get this devoted heart yielding all to God. It is the most wonderful picture. That is the temple teaching. It puts everything in its right place, so that man gets his right place in dependence and the rights of God are fully owned in every sphere. All is secured in resurrection on the ground of the greatness of the Person of Christ, and then you get a widowed heart bereft of everything as to this world,
{219}
with nothing before her but God.
Now a heart with nothing before it but God as revealed in Christ is a heart that is wealthy Godward. So that the Lord could say that she had cast in more than all the rest. They had silver and gold and costly jewels, but only the expression of their poverty Godward. They were really adorning the man that is an offence to God. But here is a poor widow that is filled with God, without a thought of herself. What a triumph! I do not know anything that will be much more interesting in scenes of glory than to get alongside that widow and to ask her how she came to such a blessed apprehension of God! I believe we shall learn it by and by. She is introduced to us as having reached a climax, as having reached the blessedness of God within the human heart; how she reached it is veiled; it is one of the blessed secrets reserved for us by and by. I look forward to having a word with that widow!
Rem. All these features are seen as having reached culmination in the city.
C.A.C. Everything culminates there. That city has the glory of God, but then, how did she acquire it? Well, you see she acquired it through the glad tidings. It is very interesting that all this teaching is spoken of as glad tidings. It says in the first verse of the chapter, "And it came to pass on one of the days, as he was teaching the people in the temple, and announcing the glad tidings" -- that is the character of it. It is all glad tidings. It is as much as to say, if you take this in you will be supremely happy. The Lord's proposal is that we should be supremely happy. And I believe the Lord is maintaining this character of things.
Ques. How are we to understand @Galatians 4: 6: "The Spirit of his Son"?
C.A.C. Nothing is more interesting than to see that it requires the presence of another co-equal divine Person. The Son came to effect redemption so that we might receive sonship, but for us to be in the good of it for the pleasure of God
{220}
requires that another divine Person should come, and be sent into our hearts. So that in our hearts He might cry 'Abba, Father'. The Spirit of His Son -- how wonderful! That is how we come to be sons of God. Not on the line of nature at all, not on the line of education or development. We receive sonship as a gift and then there is the response -- Abba, Father.
And I think you will see in the widow, you might say, one who was really in the spirit of saying, 'Abba, Father'. I mean as an illustration. Her whole heart is abounding in affection to the blessed God. Now that is the spirit of sonship. It is not merely that we say the words; they are words that we can read and repeat, but that is not the idea. It is that that is the attitude of our hearts. It is the adoring appreciation of the blessed God as known in love, so that the heart is full and can only express itself in saying, 'Abba, Father'. It is the language of the heart, not of the lips. And it requires the presence of a living Person in our hearts to enable us to do it.
Ques. Why is the Spirit sent "in my name"?
C.A.C. "In my name" is that He comes in really on behalf of Christ the Son. He comes in as given by the Father on behalf of Christ the Son. So that what was seen perfectly in Christ is produced by the Spirit in the sons. It is maintained here by the Spirit of God. So that Christ is the true Object, and the Spirit is the true Subject, and the One corresponds perfectly with the Other.

NOTES OF A READING
@Luke 22: 19, 20; @1 Corinthians 11: 23 - 34
We had before us what the Lord did in taking bread and blessing it and in giving thanks for the cup. We have seen how He would have us to enter into the spiritual import of the symbols to which He has given such wondrous meaning. The consideration of this must come first. We must think first of what the Lord did and of the significance with which He clothed the bread and the cup, so that we might apprehend and appropriate what He has made available for us spiritually in His body and His blood.
Now we pass to the consideration of what He would have us to do, and we would seek His gracious help in doing so. His intention was that we should do something, for He said, "This do in remembrance of me" and "This do, as often as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me" (@1 Corinthians 11: 24, 25). It appeals to our hearts as to what place the Lord has with us, for it is either an affectionate remembrance or nothing. The Lord has been pleased to call us to remember Him in this way. It indicates His deep personal affection and the desire of His heart to have a very definite place with us. It is in doing the act which He has appointed that we call Him to mind.
In the sacrifice of the day of atonement there was "a calling to mind of sins yearly" (@Hebrews 10: 3). This is the only passage where the word is used, save in relation to the Lord's supper in @Luke 22 and @1 Corinthians 11. It serves to illustrate how an act can call to mind that with which it stands in relation. The act of bringing the sacrifices called to mind the sins of the whole year that had passed. Now what we do in breaking the bread and eating the Lord's supper calls the Lord to mind in a collective way. It is a remembrance assemblywise, for the saints do it as having come together. The Lord desired to be called to mind in this way, and He provided a divinely simple way for us to do it, a way that was suggested
{222}
by love and that appeals to love. In His wisdom He took up material things so that there might be a tangible act which we can do in which He is called to mind. It is not merely a mental or spiritual act, but there are material elements, which remain simply what they are, bread and wine. They suggest the Lord, and concentrate our thoughts upon Him at a time and in a character when His love found full expression. The doing of this act is the one thing which normally brings the assembly together. I am sure that there is special grace from the Lord which may be confidently looked for, so that the act of eating the Supper does become what He intended it to be. Any heart coming to the Supper with affectionate desire may count on His grace for this.
In coming together we have definitely before us that the Lord would have us to call Him to mind. We do what He has told us to do in the affectionate sense that He is not here, and we call Him to mind in doing it. Love delights to respond to love in the way that love has suggested. Sometimes, perhaps, we lose the sweetness of the remembrance by having other things before us, such as the presence of the Lord in the midst, or assembly privilege of association with Him before His Father and God. But the Supper is for remembrance: it is for the calling Him to mind in the place from which He is absent. I believe the more we give our hearts to that, the more we shall realise His presence and spiritual leading.
What an appeal it is to the hearts of His own! He has asked us to do a certain act. In eating the Supper every heart and mind is concentrated on the Lord Jesus; this brings our hearts into unison. We are blessed, enriched and filled, but thinking of that is not the remembrance. What we do calls Him to mind, as having given expression to all the thoughts of His heart, and His devotion to the will of God and to us in love; it calls Him to mind as the Testator of the love of God. We know it all as for us but we know it in its full blessedness as manifested in Him. This is not exactly apprehension or appropriation but the heart appreciation of the blessedness
{223}
disclosed in Him when He went into death. Eating the Supper thus we affectionately call Him to mind in His own appointed way. The emblems before us speak of Him, not as living here or as risen and in heaven but as One whose body has been in death for us and whose blood has been poured out having the new covenant in it.
We do not, surely, forget His wondrous pathway here; it was, indeed, a 'path of worth'. Nor do we forget that He is risen and ascended. But He has said, "This do in remembrance of me"; and what we do does not speak of Christ after the flesh, but of Christ in death, His body given, His blood poured out. He is a risen, living and heavenly One now, but what we do for the remembrance of Him speaks of Him as in death. I believe it is peculiarly sweet to the Lord to be called to mind in a way that brings so definitely before us the supreme act of His love. Nothing can ever express His deep personal affection to His saints and His assembly as the giving of Himself did. It brought out the measureless character of His love. There has been a spot where all that was in the heart of Christ, and all that was in the heart of God, could be told out, and that spot was reached when He went into death. That was an act in which adequate expression could be given to it all; everything blessed was concentrated there. The death of Christ will be to all eternity the greatest fact in the moral universe.
@Luke 22 brings out in a most affecting way the contrast between what was in the heart of the Lord in instituting the Supper, and what was found in His disciples. "Behold, the hand of him that delivers me up is with me on the table". "And there was also a strife among them which of them should be held to be the greatest". Simon, too, declared his readiness to go both to prison and to death with the Lord just when he was about to be sifted as wheat by Satan. The Lord would not have us to forget the actual conditions which are known of Him to be present. The consideration of them leads to deep self-judgment. And @1 Corinthians 11 corresponds
{224}
with @Luke 22 in regard to this, for it exposes conditions on the side of the saints sadly out of accord with the Lord and with His supper, and which, if not repented of, can only come under His judgment. It is deeply humbling and exercising to think how much there is with us that is a matter of judgment. The Supper is not only the sweet and holy privilege vouchsafed by love to love, but it is a divine call to self-judgment. We have to judge ourselves in the light of the body and blood of the Lord. The public bearing of our act in eating the Supper is to announce the death of the Lord until He come. Privately there is "distinguishing the body" and proving oneself in self-judgment.
We come together as knowing that the Lord has been delivered up by one of His chosen companions, and as knowing, too, what we are in ourselves. We are as ready to want to be great as the disciples; we are as untrustworthy as Simon; as ready to think first of ourselves as the Corinthians. But in presence of that which speaks of the body and blood of the Lord all this is deeply and truly judged and the Lord gets His place with us as known in the supremacy of His love. We realise, too, that the Lord is not here, and that He is not wanted here, but we love Him and we do the act which He instituted in remembrance of Him.
But then while we do so, we cannot forget how the Lord spoke of the joy which He had in being with His own as the fruit of the vine to Him. He had spoken of that joy being resumed under entirely new conditions. His companionship with His disciples here had been cheering to His heart and He had made known to them the delight He had in being with them. They had known in His company how true was that ancient utterance of His Spirit, "My delights were with the sons of men" (@Proverbs 8: 31). He had said it to them according to @Psalm 16: 3, "To the saints that are on the earth, and to the excellent thou hast said, In them is all my delight". It is sweet to think that He said it not merely of them, but to them, that they might know it. He had called
{225}
them to be with Him, to follow Him, and they had proved His tender interest and care in a thousand ways. Particularly in those closing hours He had made known to them what they were to His heart: "With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer". It was the last act in a companionship that had been sweet to His heart; He had made them conscious of His love to them. He could say, "As I have loved you, that ye also love one another" (@John 13: 34). Indeed @John 13 to 17 is an intense expression of how He loved His own who were in the world. @John 14: 3 shows that He would have them Himself in His Father's house. It was love's desire, for love must have the company of its objects.
Now in the light of all this can we not understand Him saying, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you"? The Lord sums up, as it were, all He was saying in, "Ye have heard that I have said unto you, I go away and I am coming to you" (@John 14: 28). Do you not think this must have been exceedingly precious to the disciples when it got its place in their hearts by the Holy Spirit, the Comforter? It was to be characteristic of the period during which the world would see Him no longer. He would come to His loved ones because of the joy which it would be to Him to do so. It is the wine of His soul, drunk in an entirely new and spiritual way. He comes to His own that He may find His joy in their company.
The Lord would have us to look for His coming to us; He would have us to cultivate the spiritual conditions which would make it possible for Him to come to us. These conditions would be found where His commandments are kept, and where that act is done which He has appointed for the affectionate calling of Him to mind. For as we have seen, this would involve self-judgment and the purifying ourselves from everything unworthy of Christ.
We see in @Mark 3: 32 - 35 that there were those sitting around Him at whom He could look round in a circuit and recognise them as His moral kindred doing the will of God.
{226}
But now that He is no longer here, the circle is reconstituted as He is called to mind in His own appointed way. The will of God is that every saint should find his and her place in that circle. We should thus stand in obedience and affectionate relation to the Lord, and to the brethren who love Him. The Lord loves to come to such because of the pleasure He has in being with them. Every lover of Christ should be found in the circle which is constituted by the doing of that act which is for the calling of Him to mind.
The Lord came and stood in the midst on two successive first days of the week, suggesting to them His pleasure in their being together on that day; we know that the disciples assembled to break bread on that day (@Acts 20: 7). It is in coming together to eat the Lord's supper that the assembly comes into evidence as a concrete company; it was never intended that it should be a mystical or invisible company.
The Lord comes to His own because He delights in them, and loves to be with them. He comes to His saints in the joy which He finds in being with them, a joy which expresses itself in singing. We have no instance given of the Lord singing in resurrection, but it was made known prophetically that he would do so. "In the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises" (@Hebrews 2: 12). It was revealed that after all the infinite sorrows of atonement He would be answered "from the horns of the buffaloes" (@Psalm 22: 21), and that He would have brethren and a congregation in the midst of whom He would praise God. That Gentiles should have a part in this was assured by the word, "For this cause I will confess to thee among the nations, and will sing to thy name" (@Romans 15: 9), quoted from @Psalm 18: 49. 1 understand there is a suggestion in the word translated "sing" in the latter scripture that it is to a musical accompaniment. Think of the gentile saints in their varied local assemblies being brought into accord with the singing of Christ so as to be the tuned instrument to vibrate in harmony with His singing! Truly He is "the chief Musician", and there are "stringed instruments"
{227}
tuned by divine grace into accord with Him (@Habakkuk 3: 19). How much of profound spiritual value should we lose if we had not the Old Testament.
We may learn from the Lord through Mark and Matthew the spiritual import of the symbols which He has been pleased to clothe with such wondrous meaning. We learn too, how He has spoken of being with His own in joy, and how this leads to singing. I believe that when we come together for the affectionate remembrance of Him, He would have us to look for His coming to us. He would have us look for Him to come in the joy of that new kind of association which He has brought to pass that we might follow His lead in singing to God. I would not say that He always comes thus, for the assembly in its actual condition might need instruction or even rebuke. But the desire in what we do is that the Lord may have His place with us, and every uncomely element may be subdued and brought under judgment in presence of what speaks of the body and blood of the Lord, so that there may be a congregation or assembly where there is a place for Him, and where hearts look for Him, and where all are divinely and spiritually free to praise God in accord with Him.
The bread and the cup are for us. Then the Lord has His personal joy in coming to those whom He loves, and who love Him. Then God is praised in song. Where those things are realised there is liberty to move as led by Christ our Head into that region of spiritual and heavenly relationships which are suggested by the mount of Olives. "I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God" (@John 20: 17).
{228}
NOTES OF A READING
@Luke 22: 19 - 38
C.A.C. Attention is particularly called to the fact that the Lord gave thanks. He gave thanks for the loaf, and I suppose saying "In like manner also the cup" would imply that He gave thanks likewise for the cup. Evidently the thought of thanksgiving enters very much into the character of the Supper. So that people are right so far in speaking of what they regard as the Lord's supper as the holy Eucharist -- that is, the holy thanksgiving. It is important that the thanksgiving side should be prominent with us.
Rem. It is very remarkable that the Lord is really giving thanks to God for His own body; "A body hast thou prepared me".
C.A.C. Yes, there was that brought into presence that was a cause and spring of unmixed thanksgiving to God. How far we are removed in this from many thought of imperfection! We are moved quite away from the region where there is imperfection, and where there is a shadow upon anything, into a region where the only activity and service that is called for is thanksgiving. It was a wonderful moment for the Lord. A moment when He could give thanks in the contemplation of His own body about to be given, and of all that was bound up in the giving of His body for His loved ones. The more we consider in spirit the Lord's thanksgiving, the more we shall understand what the Supper means. In giving thanks the Lord is clearly taking a place on our side; that is, He is seen as Head when He gives thanks, it is on our side Godward.
Ques. Why do you think the Lord gave thanks for the whole loaf and not for the broken loaf?
C.A.C. I think the breaking of the loaf has in view our participation. Whereas the loaf in its unbroken state speaks
{229}
of the Lord's body, and of everything being secured on the principle of obedience, I think the completeness of it is suggested in the unbroken loaf -- that His body is given for us. We know that it necessitated His death; it was really in death that His body was given, the full devotion of His life coming out in that marvellous and never-to-be-forgotten way.
Rem. It is very remarkable too, that He does not say "This is my body which is given for you" of the whole loaf but of the broken loaf.
C.A.C. Yes, He has in view their participation. We could not participate in an unbroken loaf; the breaking comes in in view of participation. But we entertain the thought of the completeness, the whole character of what was there in His body.
Ques. I was wondering if there were more in it than participation?
C.A.C. Well, it is in connection with His giving it to them. The breaking is in view of the distribution. He gave it to them, so that all might become partakers. We all partake of one loaf, according to @1 Corinthians 10. But then we partake of it as broken, as made available for our participation. The Lord has made all secure in His Person, and through His death it is made available for us. The breaking of bread really implies that all that has come in in His blessed Person and through His death has now become available for our participation, so that He broke the bread and gave it to them. You see the same thing when the Lord blessed the loaves in @Luke 9. The breaking seems to be connected with the distribution. It is the same in chapter 24: "Having taken the bread, he blessed it, and having broken it, gave it to them". It seems to be connected with the distribution.
Ques. Does it not produce an effect in those who participate in it?
C.A.C. I have no doubt there is that. "The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of the Christ?
{230}
Because we, being many, are one loaf, one body; for we all partake of that one loaf" (@1 Corinthians 10: 16, 17). There is a moral idea connected with it there, no doubt, that we all partake of Christ, so that we become one body as all partaking of one loaf. It enters into the very nature of the institution that we all participate. Indeed the saints generally are all looked at there as having part in the act of breaking bread -- we break the bread, we bless the cup; there is the collective idea in it, for the disciples came together to break bread.
Rem. It is not so much the eating of it by which we remember Him, it is "This do in remembrance of me". It is the breaking of it that brings in remembrance.
C.A.C. There would be no remembrance according to His thought if we did not eat and drink. It is expressly said of the cup, "This do, as often as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me" (@1 Corinthians 11: 25). It is that way the Lord is called to mind collectively; it is not an individual thing. It is most blessed that the Lord has in view that all are to participate in the precious fruit and value of His having taken a body and having devoted that body in death, so that His thought in breaking the loaf is that all are to participate in it, and that is how we remember the Lord. We remember that He has taken a body and that He has devoted that body in the most absolute way, and in doing it, the great thought before Him was that the whole company of His saints should participate in it. If we limit the breaking of bread to a figure of His death, and make the remembrance lie in that alone apart from the partaking of it, I think we might lose the exceedingly precious thought that in the breaking of bread the Lord has before Him the thought of all participating, and we remember the Lord in that regard. He has taken a precious holy body; He has come into a condition marked by obedience, so that He might take up, in the obedience of love, all that is in the will of God in regard to us. He has taken it all up and carried it into effect through death, and now His thought is that we all have a common participation in it. It is only
{231}
through His death that it is possible for there to be participation, so that in that sense the breaking of bread can be regarded as a figure of His death, as that which has made possible participation in Himself and in all that has come to pass on the line of obedience. I think the Lord would have us to recognise that everything that is delightful to God and that is for our eternal blessing and joy has come in on the principle of obedience. What we have before us is the perfect obedience of one blessed Man, an obedience that is of such a character that it has not left a single element lacking in regard to the pleasure of God; and now the divine thought is that we should participate in it. It is very precious! We really participate in it, so that we can join the Lord in His thanksgiving. He could foresee and estimate it all, according to its full value, and He could give thanks before a single disciple, even Peter or John, understood it. Now we participate in it and we give thanks, so that the assembly of God is marked by this wondrous thanksgiving which continues.
Ques. Do we participate in the obedience?
C.A.C. In the fruit of the obedience; everything is on that principle, it is all involved in the thought of the Lord taking a body. He has come into a condition that is marked by obedience. "Lo, I come ... to do, O God, thy will" and, "Thou hast prepared me a body" (@Hebrews 10: 7, 5). He has come into that place, and it is a great thing for us to recognise that blessing can only come in on the principle of obedience. When God proposed the covenant, the people said, "All that Jehovah has spoken will we do!" (@Exodus 19: 8). They had the idea that obedience was right; they could not very well say anything else. Then God brings in the details of the burnt-offerings and the peace-offerings and the altar, all speaking of Christ. In @Exodus 20, when God gives the law, the moment He has completed the law He turns to speak of the altar and then brings in Christ at once. Then the Hebrew bondman has his ear bored and continues in obedience through love. That is Christ. Now we have found the principle
{232}
of obedience and the practical working out of it in Christ, and all is in view of our blessing; that is what we delight in and what we give thanks for. Perfect obedience has come in, and everything pleasurable to God has come in on the line of obedience rendered by the One who loved; it is because He loved that He obeyed. He has secured through death the whole pleasure of God in regard to us; that is the spring in our souls of unmixed thanksgiving, and the very thought of the breaking of bread suggests the participation of all. We all participate in Christ and in all that has been secured through His perfect obedience. The whole pleasure of God was entrusted to Him to carry out in obedience, and He has done it. Now we can sit down together to participate in it. What a spring of thanksgiving in every heart!
Ques. Is there the thought of that extending to the universe, because obedience will characterise the universe?
C.A.C. I think that is really what we come to. We see in Christ the way that divine love has operated, so that everything originates in love. It is love on God's part and on the part of Christ, divine love, but love moving on the line of obedience. As we think of all that, nothing remains in our hearts but thanksgiving. Not now thanksgiving for mercies and for God's goodness and loving-kindness to us in the pathway, or for the personal relief and blessing that we have, but thanksgiving for all that has been secured through the death of Christ, and that is going to spread out until it embraces the universe. Before it goes any further than the assembly we all participate in it, and the participation is involved in the breaking of bread. The more we have a sense of that the more the Lord would rise up before us as the Object of remembrance. He would rise up before us as the One who commands reverence and affection and fully occupies the mind; it is a question of the mind, 'This do for a calling of me to mind' (see note i, @1 Corinthians 11: 24). He absorbs the mind of everyone, so that we do not think of any other, but we think of Him in the blessed assurance that we participate
{233}
in all that He has brought in and all that is secured through death.
Rem. The Lord does not say, 'Do this for a remembrance of My death', but it is "of me".
C.A.C. Quite so; I think that is most important, because you have the completeness of it there. You remember the Person, not just the act. The Person includes everything; He is so great. And He says, "This do in remembrance of me".
That Person has been devoted in love to us even to death, and it moves our hearts to their very depths that a divine Person should become Man and be devoted in love to us to the fullest possible extent.
Ques. Would His body given and His blood shed be the act?
C.A.C. Well, it brings out how He has dedicated Himself; everything is looked at as coming from the divine side, so that it is all perfect. The very fact that He had a body at all is from the divine side. A body was prepared by God, and the Lord, on His part, came into it; He became flesh; He came into that condition by His own act as a divine Person; then the giving of His body was all His own act, and the pouring out of His blood was on the divine side; therefore there is not a flaw, not a jarring note, in the thanksgiving. The quality of what is before us is perfect, it is divine in quality; you see the wonderful character of it.
We come together as having judged ourselves, we have had all out before we come. We have all been before God before coming. It is not supposed that we shall come to break bread without the process of self-review. "Let a man prove himself" supposes that you come from a process of self review and as having come to the conclusion that everything connected with you as in the flesh is absolutely worthless for God and needed to be blotted out in the death of Christ.
Apart from that you could not look at divine things at all.
Then, when you have, so to speak, bathed your flesh in water, you find that there is that before you which is a spring
{234}
of unmixed thanksgiving. Every feature of it touches the spring of thanksgiving in the heart, and whether you apprehend little or much -- a babe in Christ apprehends but little, and a father in Christ apprehends much -- what we apprehend is absolutely perfect and is a spring of thanksgiving. So that we come together in that spirit of thanksgiving which the Lord inaugurated when He gave thanks.
Ques. Would it be right if every believer came together with the sentiment that imbued Paul when he said, "The Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me" (@Galatians 2: 20)?
C.A.C. Surely that is right. If we are moving on the line which the apostle Paul indicates when he says that, it would be all right when we came together. He says, "In that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me". Now that is a daily matter, is it not? If we go through the week in that spirit we should come together in the same affectionate mind. We come to think of the Lord collectively, because that is the idea in the breaking of bread; it is a collective thing. We come to call the Lord to mind in a certain way which He Himself has appointed, collectively and unitedly. We do it in a most significant act -- we break bread so that everyone present is to participate.
Ques. Do you think it would be possible, if all the saints were together in the way which you have been suggesting, that we should reach the point in which His love would be predominant?
C.A.C. Yes, I think the whole point of the institution is that divine love dominates -- the love of Christ, a divine Person; He has become Man that He might give His body for us, and then He says, "This cup is the new covenant". I believe the Lord in this takes up the position of One who could Himself consummate the covenant; only God could do that. The pouring out of the blood was a divine act. That it was done by the Roman soldier is a very material way of
{235}
looking at it. The whole point is that the pouring out of His blood was His own act, and it is beautiful that even in the Old Testament, Jehovah says, "I have given it [the blood] to you upon the altar" (@Leviticus 17: 11). Even of old, God would have the blood to be regarded as His own gift, in the type. When we come to the precious antitype He says, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you". It is God consummating the covenant from His own side in all the infinite value of the precious blood of Christ. There is not a flaw there, is there? You see how beautifully it would give a thanksgiving character to it all. We need to pray that we may have more apprehension of what the loaf and cup really speak of. We should ask the Lord before we come together. I have said sometimes that we pray for realisation, but it would be more intelligent if we prayed for apprehension. Realisation rather turns the mind to some process within, but apprehension is that you take account of what is presented to you objectively. Now we need to pray for that; everything that is set forth in the body of Christ and in His blood is a subsisting reality, and we need to pray that we may apprehend the reality, and as we apprehend it we shall be abundantly furnished with material for thanksgiving. The brothers will be all ready to voice it because the sisters¬ hearts are all filled with it; what the brothers say depends on what the sisters think.
All this leads to the remembrance having its true character. There would not be any remembrance if we were not common participators. That is something more than our thanking the Lord at home. We have all remembered the Lord a good many times today; it has been a bad day for us if we have not, but then that is not breaking bread. Breaking bread is a company thing, it is the Lord's own institution so that we should call Him to mind collectively, as all having come into participation in all that exists in Himself and which has been made effective in regard to us in His death. That is the true idea of the breaking of bread, and it gives true
{236}
assembly remembrance of the Lord. We remember Him assemblywise, and quite differently from what you can do in your own room.
You do not know what sort of meeting you are going to have next Lord's Day. We should cultivate the idea that next Lord's Day it is going to be something different from what it has ever been before. We are going to have a deeper and sweeter apprehension of the Lord's body given for us and His blood poured out for us than we have ever had before, and therefore we want, and expect, a more powerful spring of thanksgiving than we ever had before.
Ques. How far did the woman in Simon's house enter into this?
C.A.C. Well, she had apprehended the grace of the Creditor, she had apprehended that the Creditor was there, which poor Simon had no idea of. The Creditor was there, but He was there in the unbounded grace of forgiveness, and therefore she could express the apprehension that she had of Him; it would make a very good start towards all this that we have had before us.
Ques. I would like to ask what the Lord meant by "This do in remembrance of me".
C.A.C. I think it was the whole, you could not leave any part of the institution out. The Lord's taking the loaf, giving thanks and breaking it all enter into the thing; if you left one of these elements out it would not be right. We know that we should not feel at all comfortable to get up and break the bread without giving thanks. The youngest child would feel it was not right, and it would not be right to give thanks and then pass the loaf round without first breaking it; you would have left something out. If the bread were broken and thanks were given for the cup without the saints partaking in both it would not really be the Lord's supper. Every detail has to come into it, and as it does, the Lord rises before us. It has often been said that the brother who gives thanks really suggests the Lord, if he is spiritual. That is, the very way the
{237}
brother gives thanks suggests to the affections of the saints how the Lord gave thanks. Very often the brother actually refers to the Lord's own actions.
Rem. The Lord was made known to them in the breaking of bread.
C.A.C. Quite so. Nobody could do it as He did, and so we love to think of Him breaking the bread. He is absent and we come together to do it, but we remember how the Lord did it, and therefore profound reverence marks the occasion; every lover of the Lord regards the breaking of bread with profound reverence. There is nothing like it. There is nothing else that the Lord has so connected with His own Person. He says, "This do in remembrance of me". He has connected it with His own Person so that we feel when we come together that it is most holy. We feel, as we come into the room and see the loaf and cup on the table, that morally we should take our shoes off. That is, we put ourselves into a worshipping attitude as we come in, so that the Supper becomes more holy, and commands more the spirit of adoration every time we do it.
Ques. What is the setting in Corinthians?
C.A.C. In 1 Corinthians the thought of the communion is emphasised to correct the local state. The occasion is not only one of communion but it involves a public witness. There is the public witness that the Lord has died; we "announce the death of the Lord, until he come" (@1 Corinthians 11: 26). The saints coming together to eat and to drink have the character of public witness; that is, it is a memorial to the Lord. The Supper has that character as it stands here as a memorial to the fact that the Lord has died in this world, and that memorial is going to stand until He comes again.
Rem. It is maintained in all its freshness, on account of the Person who has instituted it.
C.A.C. It is wonderful the interest that the Lord maintains in the hearts of His saints. We have had hundreds of readings on the Lord's supper, and the saints never tire of it.
{238}
If the Lord could have found a better means to speak to our hearts than He did, He would have done so. The very fact that He took a loaf and a cup shows that in the wisdom of divine love there is no better means of our being collectively enabled to call Him to mind.
{239}
NEARNESS TO BE ENJOYED IN THE ASSEMBLY
@Luke 24: 26 - 31, 36
I read this scripture having in mind to say a word that would further the spiritual movements that have been suggested to us during the past few days, and to encourage us in regard of those things which would make our place of association with Christ a very great reality to us.
We thankfully accept as divine light what has been made known to us, and no doubt hold it as a matter of faith, but the Lord would exercise our hearts that we might have it more consciously in a sense of personal nearness to Him. I have in mind the sense of nearness that can be enjoyed in the assembly. It is most important that we should understand that our relations with Christ are on the footing that He has entered into His glory.
His sufferings and death were a deep divine necessity; indeed, He says here, "Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things ... ?" His sufferings and death were a divine necessity, as we all recognise. But there is no suffering Christ now. There is no dead Christ now, either on the cross or in the grave. He was there in His matchless love, and it touches and captivates our hearts to know that He was there, but the assembly does not know Him there. That is, the relations of the assembly are not with Him as on the cross or in the grave; our associations are with Him as having entered into His glory. The consideration of this is of deepest moment to us.
The Lord has been in conditions of humiliation. When He was here in His precious, holy life, it was not a time of glory, but of humiliation. For the glory of God He was here in suffering manhood, and this is precious and profound beyond compare. It touches and wins our hearts. Yet we
{240}
need to know with personal affection that our links are with Christ as having entered into His glory. The eyes of the disciples were holden so as not to know Him. Often it is thus with us. We may have precious ministry which makes our hearts glow within us; we may enjoy the Scriptures, and being together, and the breaking of bread -- we may have all that, and yet no personal recognition of Himself as near to us. But He wants us to enter into this, and particularly in the assembly.
The Lord's supper is intended to prepare us for a manifestation of Himself. He said, "This do in remembrance of me", or, 'for the calling of me to mind'. If He is called to mind, the mind of the assembly is filled with Himself. Such a company would be very attractive to the Lord. He would be moved to come to us. We can hardly think of His coming to a company that was not attractive to Him.
In @Luke 24 we see the service of the Lord in grace to educate and adjust disciples, so that they might be prepared for a manifestation. They were not ready when He joined them, their eyes were holden. No manifestation is given except to those prepared for it. He went over the whole scope of the Scriptures in reference to Himself, and so moved their hearts. They had known Him as in death, and their hearts were very sad, though they need not have been.
The Scriptures and His own words would have kept them from being downcast. Mary of Bethany was not with them, and I can hardly think that she was downcast, for she had learned Him as the resurrection and the life. They were out of the secret, and how often we are out of the secret of God's mind. But He ministered to them until their whole hearts wished to have it. He warms our hearts so that we want Himself. Do we want Himself? It is precious to hear of Him and His glory, but all is granted that we should want *Himself*. "It is I myself" -- that is what He wants to bring us to. Hearts that want Him will get Him, and the moment was reached when He sat down at their table and the blessed touch was given to them that manifested Himself to them.
{241}
When the Lord took the bread and blessed it, and broke it, and gave it to them, they recognised Him. It was not now facts about Him, but Himself. The bread He broke represented the new condition into which He had come through death. It is death viewed from that standpoint; that is, as His way into His glory. The fact that He broke the bread and put it into their hands suggested a new condition of manhood into which He had entered through death, and His giving it into their hands suggested that they were to have part in that kind of humanity. Whether they be few or many, there are moments in privilege and blessing when we realise that we have part in His risen life, we are of that order of humanity into which He entered in resurrection. His giving the bread to them was an indication that they were to partake of the same order of life in which He was as risen. The other disciples were confounded and frightened when He came, but I can hardly think that those two were affrighted.
They had learnt the wondrous lesson that they had a part with Him in the new order of humanity in which He was as the risen One. It is a sorrowful thing that thousands of lovers of Christ have never learnt this lesson. They think of His life on earth and of His death as making atonement, and they believe in the fact of His resurrection, but Himself as risen they do not know, still less that they have part in His life as risen. But He comes to His own to give us consciousness that we are of His order of manhood, and that we can be near to Him without the slightest sense of disparity.
His disappearing from the two disciples was as much as to say, 'If you want more of Me, you must find it at Jerusalem'. And so He gives us personal touches in order to bring us to the assembly -- He makes His saints conscious that they have part in His life, and so are suitable to be led into all those thoughts of divine love that are known in the assembly.
We may enjoy ministry, but something more than that is needed to satisfy the heart of Christ. It is the consciousness of His personal nearness, so that He is known by those who have part in His own life.
{242}
NOTES OF A READING
@Luke 24: 36 - 53
A.M.H. When considering this part of the chapter we do not want to ignore what immediately precedes, for it has a bearing on the subject; that is in the two going to Emmaus, the Lord conversing with them and finally going in with them and making Himself known in the breaking of bread. You have in a way an illustration of what takes place at the Supper.
Often with us there is the idea that certain preliminaries are required, and the reason is that we have not sufficiently recognised the character of the Supper, which in itself is preliminary. The Supper is the preparation for the assembly. The Lord saw that it was necessary for us, as coming from our wilderness conditions, to have something to open the way for assembly functioning. The. Supper is the institution for that purpose. We may not have wandered into the country, but we need this touch from the Lord. It is normal for the Lord to make Himself known to us in the breaking of bread. The touch of the Lord is some spiritual thought of Himself and often develops throughout the Supper as we follow it.
At the commencement of our meeting we do not need an introduction. We may begin with a hymn, which is a kind of carry-over from the previous meetings, and an expression of joy; the Supper is introduced as an ordinance to start us, and taking it thus at the beginning gives time for development as under the Lord's leading.
Rem. The breaking of bread you refer to was at Emmaus in a house.
A.M.H. The immediate effect is that they are found in the company. "And rising up the same hour, ... they found the eleven, and those with them, gathered together". The breaking of bread puts us together. The Lord shows Himself in the breaking of bread, and there is an immediate transition
{243}
from the individual to the collective position, which is proper. The Supper adjusts us as coming from our various homes, it puts us together, and the Lord has introduced it for that purpose.
C.A.C. The Lord has done much for us in giving us to see that it is a normal summons which brings the saints together in assembly character. Is there any other?
A.M.H. Anything else would be introduced by ourselves, and that would be foreign to the Lord's mind.
C.A.C. It is very beautiful that the Lord should have thought of such an exceedingly simple act for us to *do*: "This do in remembrance of me". But it requires that those who love Him in every locality where His name is called upon should be unified in doing it. There is nothing sectional about it.
A.M.H. Naturally we each dwell in our own separate surroundings, but the Lord's supper is the unifying element. When the Lord was here He was the unifying element, but now He has provided for His absence.
C.A.C. And also that we should *do* something: "This do in remembrance of me".
A.M.H. You attach importance to the fact that we are all doing something.
C.A.C. Yes, and everything outside of what is set forth in that is excluded by the words, "remembrance of me". There is nothing more unifying than that. It is the appeal of the Lord to all that love Him, and if listened to would practically unify all the saints in every place.
A.M.H. Because while the bread speaks of His giving His body for us and primarily bears on what we are locally, it would include all He gave Himself for -- all the saints, and in our minds we include all.
C.A.C. And it must be taken up locally, because if it is not, there will be no concrete expression of the divine thought at all.
Jos. S. You mean it is not possible for all believers to meet together in one place?
{244}
C.A.C. The idea is that it is done locally, and the one bread and one cup themselves suggest that the saints would respond to the Lord and do what He says in relatively small companies.
A.M.H. It is a very local matter here. These two had got adrift from their brethren, but the Lord showing Himself to them awakens immediately the normal sense of the company to which they belong, and they return to Jerusalem to the ordered condition of things. They fall in with what they find there, and say certain things in line with what is being said.
C.A.C. Was there development suggested in the Lord's movements in chapter 24 as compared with His institution of the Supper in chapter 22? In that chapter the bread and cup spoke of the Lord in death, but in chapter 24 He is leading them by a moral road which ends in the revelation of Himself as risen. I was wondering if the breaking of the bread in chapter 24 did not carry us further than the loaf and the cup in chapter 22, as bringing us, in the apprehension of our souls, to Christ as risen. Does not the breaking of bread in chapter 24 suggest His death as that by which He comes to a new position and condition as risen? Would it not embody in a striking symbol all that was substantiated in Himself as risen? He had been showing them how all the Scriptures referred to Himself. And the loaf in chapter 24 would set forth all that is established in Himself as risen, and He is known in relation to that, so they go back to the company. It had a unifying effect, and the company was gathered in the light of Himself risen.
A.M.H. It shows how the light adjusts; they get a view of the Lord as risen, and it carries their minds to those who recognise Him as risen.
C.A.C. Is not the development of spiritual intelligence very prominent in Luke's gospel, especially so in this chapter? Hence the great detail connected with the scope of Scripture, how all the scriptures speak concerning Himself, and more particularly as bearing upon Himself as risen
{245}
(verse 27). I was wondering whether that would not put us outside the present world system altogether.
A.M.H. Would it bring the tabernacle system into view? The death of Christ as severing us from one scene, and resurrection bringing another world into view in Him?
C.A.C. We must seethe thing established on the ground of the death of Christ before we are prepared to touch the resurrection sphere.
A.M.H. The death of Christ gives the right basis for everything and conveys the impress of the love of Christ to our hearts, carrying captive our affections, and displacing all expectations from the scene in which He died. All this is now in Him. How far would you carry that in relation to the loaf? I suppose it includes the idea of the saints: one body.
C.A.C. I thought we had a further development when we come to resurrection and the Lord's movement in resurrection; we are then on another footing altogether. Is not the close of the gospels designed to bring the saints in their affections on to the ground of being risen with Christ? The disciples at the end of the gospel were brought in their affections to taste of being risen with Him. They could be in the company of a risen Man in an out-of-the-world condition. This would challenge all our hearts. Do we know that, to be collectively, not simply individually, in association with a risen Man?
A.M.H. It is not easy, evidently. The disciples were afraid -- in their minds and feelings they were still on this side of death.
C.A.C. And the Lord would take extraordinary pains to verify Himself to us as risen, in our affections collectively, so that we may be in concert with One who is alive out of death. One feels how little one knows of this, but how can we be really in testimony here unless we do know something about it?
Rem. In @John 20, Thomas is not there, and the Lord comes in again when he was there.
{246}
C.A.C. Yes, He would bring them all the way in John, but it is as far as Bethany only, in Luke.
A.M.H. What is all the way?
C.A.C. It has often been said that the saints were gathered in @John 20 by a message given to Mary: "I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God"
(@John 20: 17). That is all the way; you can never get further than that, it is the terminus.
A.M.H. When He comes among them in John's account He shows them His hands and His side. What would that indicate?
C.A.C. That calls attention to Himself as the One whose mighty hands had carried into effect all the purposes of the Father's love; those purposes are only carried out and brought to pass in the power of the blood and water which flowed from His side, which effected not only complete expiation but also purification. So He can say of the saints, "Go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". We cannot go higher or further than that. That is further than Bethany!
A.M.H. So in showing His hands it is like saying, "It is finished". He had all the purpose of God in view when on the cross.
C.A.C. In Luke it is not His hands and His side but His hands and His feet.
A.M.H. Would His hands there have relation to His service to us?
C.A.C. Yes. His hands would represent His service of grace; I think we have seven touches of His hands in Luke, bringing out the perfection of the service of grace which He has rendered on God's part to men. His feet would represent His blessed movements by which He has brought to light what God is -- the God of grace.
A.M.H. Is there some thought of the Mediator -- the feet suggesting God brought to us through Christ?
C.A.C. I thought so, and the object in view in chapter 24 is that the saints should be made competent to carry on the
{247}
service of grace. Jerusalem and the temple position are in view, not the upper room.
A.M.H. Is there continuation of service there (see verse 47)?
C.A.C. Yes, and Jerusalem in Luke's gospel has a certain dignity. In John it is discredited, but the end of Luke is more in keeping with @Isaiah 2: 3.
A.M.H. It is more connected with the assembly here; that is, on earth.
C.A.C. It is the public position of the saints in the testimony of grace; is it not well that we should hold all this in our affections in connection with the Lord's supper? The whole of Scripture is consummated in Himself as risen, but it is all in view of setting up the saints in a public position in testimony, so that we break bread in the morning in view of the gospel meeting at night.
A.M.H. Here He leads them out as far as Bethany. We may say, 'We did not get to the Father this morning', but He may have the testimony in view and something to be worked out in the saints, to strengthen us during the week.
C.A.C. It is a great loss to us if we do not entertain that view of the Lord's supper. It stands in relation to the testimony, something for God here which derives its strength from the loaf and the cup and the apprehension of Christ risen. We need to be strengthened for the continuation of the blessed service of Christ.
A.M.H. So the assembly in that way is the continuation of Christ as the anointed vessel. I think we are rather limited in giving thanks for the loaf. What would you say would help us? It is not just the death of Christ, but Himself risen enters into it.
C.A.C. "In remembrance of me". The "me" is out of death. The emblems speak of Christ in death, but the "me" is out of death. When the evangelists wrote the gospels what a sense they must have had in their souls that the One about whom they wrote was risen and glorified. Every verse was written in the light of the now risen and glorified Man. So we break the bread in the deep and blessed consciousness that
{248}
He is risen. This would help to put us clean outside of the world, not only in its profane, but in its religious aspect.
A.M.H. So in @Revelation 5 the Lord is seen as a Lamb standing as slain. He is living, but is identified as having been slain, and He takes the book and gives effect to what is written in it.
C.A.C. I think this chapter adds something to what has been set forth in the Supper as instituted in chapter 22. It would suggest that the Lord's death has been His way to an entirely new position.
A.M.H. Paul says, "I received from the Lord ..." (@1 Corinthians 11: 23, 24). He speaks from a risen Christ. Beautiful to have that before us!
C.A.C. Would that not liberate our hearts for some of the developments suggested earlier?
A.M.H. It would certainly put a stop to all preconceived thoughts. If we start with the Lord in resurrection, what may He not lead us to? We must leave it to Him as to how He is going to proceed. I suppose the loaf in a way is extricatory, and the cup would put us together in the fulness of satisfaction. Would the cup bring in a satisfying portion so that God is magnified?
C.A.C. Yes, and the thought of the saints having a common portion. It takes a great deal of divine workmanship to bring us into what we have in common. We are naturally so self-centred. After being carnally self-centred we become spiritually self-centred. We never get on until we begin to say "we". It is the first ray of light in a believer's soul when he begins to say "we".
Jos. S. It is the bread which we break.
C.A.C. Yes, you cannot think of doing it alone. You must say "we", and when you say it in your soul you have touched the assembly, a unified company with great wealth, and you are bound up with that company, and there cannot be anything sectional about it. All the blessed truth of Ephesians can only be taken up by us as saying "we".
{249}
A.M.H. It is interesting to see that the first experimental plurals in Romans are "our Lord" in the end of chapter 7 and "those" in chapter 8: 1, after the "I" question has been settled.
C.A.C. Yes, you get many "I's" and "me's" in chapter 7, and many of us live there. We may think we are out of it, but as long as we say "I" we are in it. You cannot say "I" about the things in chapter 8. You have things there in common with all saints, and this puts the thoughts of the assembly in your affections and you cannot think of anything less than all believers being in it. If I have the Spirit of God, I cannot possibly isolate myself from the millions on earth who have the same Spirit. You have done with all sectarian thoughts then! All that has been brought to us in the death of Christ is a commonwealth; it belongs to the "we", the whole company. "Because we, being many, are one loaf, one body"; "The cup of blessing which we bless"; "The bread which we break". It is a universal "we", and all Christians are supposed to break that bread and bless that cup; if not, they have not come to the most elementary thought of christian blessing.
A.M.H. Yes. It is a great thing to think of coming together in assembly.
C.A.C. Yes, the great catholic truth is to be held, and it can only be truly held as in separation from what denies it in a practical sense. There may be only twenty or thirty people prepared to recognise it, but what they recognise is universal, and if all believers recognised it, all would be unified.
A.M.H. We hold it for them.
C.A.C. We hold the spiritual valuables as being the property of all the saints -- all the blessed things in Scripture belong to them -- so we are always to be catholic in our outlook.
A.M.H. You would think that when the Lord came in it would be a wonderful time, but it is not always so. The disciples were frightened, and if we are not moving
{250}
collectively, confusion arises. But we should all get an impression of the Lord and follow it up, and He would decide how far it would be developed on any particular occasion, do you not think?
C.A.C. The truth bound up in the assembly is like an ocean and each meeting like a thimble let down into it. The divine thought is that in every place saints should be together for the Supper, and then the whole realm of divine wealth would become available to us.
A.M.H. You cannot expect to get through the whole on each occasion.
C.A.C. Oh, no indeed! It is what will fill eternity, and it is impossible to condense it all into one hour on a Lord's Day morning!
A.M.H. When the Lord comes in there is often the feeling of confusion and fear with us, as here. The Lord may give a touch which attracts us, and we feel unequal to following it up, but if we waited on Him in relation to what He presents, we should get an understanding of Himself that we never had before we came to the meeting.
Rem. "They gave him part of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb".
C.A.C. Whatever we may have locally is partial: "part of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb". The Lord presents to us the fulness of the divine thought, the whole loaf. But if we had our beloved brother Paul here, he would say, "We know in part". What they gave Him would represent what there was by the working of God. It was there, and the Lord would say, 'Now I can appreciate and enjoy that'. What an encouragement that the Lord would look around in any company and challenge us to bring out the wealth that is there. It is only partial, but the Lord would have it and enjoy it. He would give us a sense that what is effected in our souls is a positive satisfaction to Him. The risen One can come into the midst of His own to appreciate what is with us by the grace and work of God. Does that not draw your heart out to Him?
{251}
Is there something in us that can give satisfaction to the risen Lord, that He can feed upon and appreciate? Thank God there is! Then He can lead us on; there is no point from which you can be led on unless you have something the Lord can enjoy; then there is something to lead us from.
A.M.H. Would the fish suggest the sovereignty of God in an abstract and hidden way, and the honeycomb local conditions?
C.A.C. Yes, the fish in the gospels suggest the sovereign action of God in taking out of the world what is for Himself; but then every cell in the honeycomb is fitted together. It is collective. It is the divine thought that we should all fit together perfectly. If the flesh and nature were eliminated, we should all fit together perfectly and be filled with the grace of God -- all that is known in Christ. He would say, 'It all came from Me, but you can give it back to Me and I can enjoy it'.
A.M.H. Would His body given for us (@Luke 22: 19) involve all that the laying down of His life meant, and that what He brought here is now available to us?
C.A.C. I thought when the Lord said, "This is my body which is given for you", He was suggesting to us the amazing results of His incarnation -- the whole blessed result of a divine Person having come down here to take up a body. How far-reaching and measureless it is! And all is to be taken up in assembly. It is so good to get away from our naturally restricted thoughts, for we are in the midst of a profession filled with the restricted thoughts of the mind of man, and we want to get outside of that into a region where things are illimitable as the result of Christ's death, and of everything being substantiated in Himself as risen.
A.M.H. "He led them out as far as Bethany, and having lifted up his hands, he blessed them". Would that convey a deepened sense of what the Lord had been here, now linked up with Him risen? It is like a meeting closing with what the Lord had in His heart for them, for on that particular
{252}
occasion that is the closing note.
C.A.C. Yes, they learn from His priestly service in connection with this new order of things. It was at Bethany that He was first apprehended by one soul in the power of His resurrection. The Lord loved Bethany because it was there where the truth of His resurrection was apprehended. Mary anointed Him for burial, but with His resurrection in view.
A.M.H. There was a home there for Him. Do you think the thought of a home for Christ may be a good note to finish our meeting on? Is it the Lord's mind that we should always reach the thought of the Father? It is the highest note, but one hour is very short to compass the whole range of divine thoughts, as you have said.
C.A.C. I think what you may get in the local assembly at any particular meeting is not known. You should know what will transpire up to the breaking of bread. It is a fixed order. We come together to do a certain act -- to break bread, and not for preliminary exercises; that is the first thing before you, but afterwards you do not know what will happen. In christendom there is just a formal service, often piously carried out, and things are restricted.
If you think of all the wealth that divine love has bestowed upon the assembly, you will realise that only a little part can be touched on one occasion, and the question is what part of it the Lord will enable us to touch on any particular Lord's Day morning. We look to have the present conscious joy of some part of what will be our eternal blessedness and to serve God in our praises in relation to it, but we do not know beforehand exactly what it will be, for this depends on the present leading of Christ as Head, and it also depends on the spiritual conditions which are found on our side.
{253}
NOTES OF A READING
@Luke 24: 50 - 53
C.A.C. The Lord leading the disciples to Bethany seems to me a striking and suggestive move in view of the position which He had spoken of in the preceding verses, and having in view their taking up the public position in Jerusalem which was in His mind at the moment. My impression is they had to reach Jerusalem by way of Bethany. It suggests to my mind a private movement which belongs to the intimacy of love to prepare the disciples for the public position. This is the only movement of the kind in resurrection which is recorded in Luke. Bethany had, as ever, a distinct place in the Lord's affections; no doubt it was the features that He had found there which endeared the place to Him, so His heart turned to Bethany as the most suitable place from which He would be carried up into heaven; it was a spot as near to heaven as any other place on earth. In Bethany there had been a distinct intimation that the Lord would have companions in resurrection -- Lazarus was one of those at table with Him, and if there was one it implies there were others; Lazarus was the pattern.
The Lord was leading in this way to Bethany to have His own with Him as risen; He could not have them with Him otherwise. However little they could have understood or explained that they were risen with Him, brought to it by the operation of faith. Those risen with Christ have no interests on earth save the interests precious to Christ. It was experience here, not light, though of course there was light. Wonderful -- they moved a Sabbath day's journey with the risen One! They could not have done that if they had not been risen with Him; they moved with Him to Bethany, the extraordinary Jerusalem position was reached by way of Bethany. They were a company continually praising and blessing God; we reach that by way of Bethany. It is a good
{254}
platform for evangelists to stand on; if there is not worship there will not be strength. The Lord had in mind that Jerusalem was to be the centre; He says to them, "Remain in the city till ye be clothed with power from on high"; it was to be the centre. So @Isaiah 2: 3 says, "Out of Zion shall go forth the law, and Jehovah's word from Jerusalem" The day coming is anticipated in the assembly, so "beginning at Jerusalem" the gospel should be preached. Paul said, "I, from Jerusalem, and in a circuit round to Illyricum, have fully preached the glad tidings of the Christ" (@Romans 15: 19).
Ques. Are you thinking of this geographically or spiritually?
C.A.C. We apply it spiritually, but of course it was so geographically. The assembly was centred in Jerusalem as we see in the early chapters of Acts. Jerusalem stands for the public position, and the private intimacy of Bethany is necessary for the public position of Jerusalem. The strength of the Jerusalem position is a company continually worshipping.
In Bethany they made Him a supper -- this is an advance on the Lord's supper. The Lord intended His supper as a provision of His love for us to lead us on to @John 12, but in Bethany they made Him a supper; He was manifestly the pre-eminent One there. In @Colossians 3: 1 we get "raised with the Christ"; we are on resurrection ground there and the Lord's supper gets a great enlargement and elevation when eaten by those risen with Christ. While the Supper itself belongs to the wilderness, yet if the saints know what it is to be risen with Christ they can eat it in an enlarged and spiritual manner. Those in the good of being risen with Christ are in perfect liberty because they are outside the reach of sin and death altogether; they touch something outside responsibility.
Bethany speaks of a spiritual move; He led them "as far as Bethany", not as far as heaven; it is not ascension. Then He blesses them, lifting up His hands, putting on them all the virtue in Himself as risen. In Leviticus the priest blesses in
{255}
the value of the sacrifice, but there is more here; this is the blessing of One alive in the power of indissoluble life.
Ques. In what relation does the mount of Olives stand to Bethany?
C.A.C. My impression is that the mount of Olives gives you the purely spiritual side, but Bethany brings in the saints. The Lord was thinking of something subjective, which marked that place in the saints. We get the mount of Olives in @Acts 1, but @Luke 24 is an advance on @Acts 1 which stands more in relation to Paul's ministry. The temple idea enters much into Paul's ministry, but I thought here there was no going to the upper room. They return from Bethany to Jerusalem and were continually in the temple. It suggests the dignity of the public service. We should be exercised as to whether the public praise has temple dignity. Paul speaks of the building growing, indicating to us that the temple idea is to be developed. It is not to be a stagnant thing; it is to be always growing. It is the public service of God, of praise and dignity; it is the basis on which the evangelist stands, a company continually praising. The Lord has secured a company which can be continually praising. The literal temple is brought in with a spiritual suggestion. The Spirit of God tells us they were continually in the temple, but in @Acts 1 they went to the upper room; that was privacy. Luke calls our attention to the public temple, not formal, but as carrying on a continual service praising and blessing. We must not be content that the temple idea should be always as small as it is now.
The service of grace would go out effectively from those praising and blessing. We see it at Philippi with Paul and Silas. Were they in prison? No, in the temple! And the prisoners were listening. The public position was established, and grace could be effective. The prisoners *listened*; no doubt all of them were converted, for not one ran away when the doors were opened. They were paying attention to the prayers and praises rising to God from two priests standing
{256}
by night in the temple, like @Psalm 104: l. A man was telling me lately that he was converted by hearing an old brother's prayer! If saints were happier and praising there would be more blessing in the preaching. I used to notice that when we had a happy time of praise on Lord's Day morning the preaching in the evening went all right.
One can understand how the Lord's heart was moved in affection at Bethany. His heart turned to it and He could move with them there. He would say, 'I want to lead you there'; it is His mind to lead us all. We do not know much of being risen with Christ; if we did we should be free from all the influences that act on men living in the world. The Lord led them as far as to Bethany, and then He is separated from them. He does not take them to heaven; He leaves them on earth. How often they would think of how they moved in life with the risen Lord and of how free He was! How He lifted up His hands and blessed them, sending them back to Jerusalem with the atmosphere of Bethany in their hearts.
Those who preach stand on this wonderful platform, like Paul when he introduces his gospel by saying, "God ... whom I serve in my spirit in the glad tidings of his Son"
(@Romans 1: 9). He is standing on the priestly platform, serving in priestly spirit, though he may only preach repentance and remission of sins. It is the state of the priest's heart and affections that gives power. We are all admitted to this service, and our attitude Godward largely determines our power manward. To stand in the temple continually blessing and praising God is the full result of the gospel. What sets us in happy relations with God is learning the Lord Himself as risen and moving in His life so that we are brought into the secret intimacy and association of which Bethany speaks; thus we have His priestly blessing. It does not say they were praising the Lord Jesus.
Ques. Do we partake of the Supper in Jerusalem?
C.A.C. The different positions in which the saints can be viewed affect our hearts in partaking of the Supper; and
{257}
though it is eaten in the wilderness, it is eaten where He died, and His memorial is there. That is the actual setting, but the spiritual progress of our souls affects the way we approach it. While it belongs to the wilderness, if the saints know what it is to be risen with Christ they can eat it in an enlarged and spiritual manner. If we had been at Corinth we should have seen the way they approached the Supper, and if we had broken bread at Ephesus there would have been a different atmosphere. Jerusalem where our Lord was crucified is the literal Jerusalem. The thought of Jerusalem at the end of Luke is Jerusalem looked at according to God, the centre from which He would operate in this world. In Luke, Jerusalem is not looked at as the guilty city, though of course it was guilty.
In @Luke 24 the loaf is a symbol of Christ risen, the One in whom was embodied every Old Testament promise, and He gives it to them. The loaf in chapter 22 is in relation to His death, and in chapter 24 it relates to Him as risen and in breaking it He was known to them. Then they can give Him something; He says, "Have ye anything here to eat?" He loves to set us at ease. It is all leading up to the service of grace; the glad tidings are clothed with it so that repentance and remission of sins are preached in His name. God has invested it with the greatest charm, and they, as coming back to Jerusalem with all that wealth in their hearts, are continually in the temple praising and blessing God.
Ques. What had you in mind in saying that they were not praising the Lord Jesus?
C.A.C. The service of grace rendered by the Lord Jesus is designed to make God great in our thoughts and praises; it is all to that end, and the Lord's satisfaction is not in being praised but in God being praised. He might say to us, 'Have you not a word to say to God? Have I not made God so great that you have something to say to Him?'
Ques. Perhaps we need adjusting on that point?
C.A.C. If we were accustomed to reading Scripture we should not need adjusting. We find there a divine Person
{258}
come down in manhood that we might know God. Sometimes praise to Jesus indicates a lack of liberty. What did heaven say when He came into the world? "Glory to God in the highest"; it was heaven's utterance, the praise of that Babe meant glory to God in the highest. It is a serious matter if we are slow to get to God, even on the lowest footing; Christ suffered for sins to bring us to God. The fact is that many have not really been brought to God. It means bringing us as priests; Peter's thought would be that a man who went to God was a priest. The first description of a priest was one who draws near to God. It pleases me to praise my Saviour, and the Lord appreciates it but He might say, 'If you want to please Me, praise God'. The Lord has come in in wonderful grace to turn us to God from idols; that is the simplest statement of conversion. We have to think of the incarnation and the death of Christ as the movements of God, so in the Supper the Lord says of the loaf, "This is my body". He calls our attention in a wonderful way to His incarnation; He has a body, the greatest wonder in the universe, the most marvellous thing in eternity, and the whole value of the incarnation and what is associated with it is all for the assembly. The thought of God is behind it, and the cup is the covenant; Christ is a divine Person, for none but God could consummate the covenant. In the Father we have the full revelation of God in grace -- a name which suggests the thought of relationship. If I know and praise God as "the Father" it is as revealed in Son, in contrast to what is revealed in the Old Testament. Then "your Father" is conscious relationship with God as Father. Then the comprehensiveness of "my God and your God" goes beyond everything.
All that God is will be carried into eternity as a theme of praise. What God is as Creator will be carried in. I do not think we give enough place to Him as Creator; is God ever to lose the praise of His creatorial glory? He will have the praise of all that He is. It would be dreadful to think that God could cease to have glory and praise to Him as Creator.
{259}
In @Revelation 4: 11 we get, "Thou art worthy, O our Lord and our God, to receive glory and honour and power; for thou hast created all things, and for thy will they were, and they have been created". God will have the praise of all that He is, but certain names have their place at certain periods and they bring to light what belongs to God and what forms His praise; nothing of God could drop out of the category of praise.
'God all in all' is the consummation of everything. God in His ineffable blessedness is in all; it brings us to the highest thing conceivable.

ACTS OF THE APOSTLES
{262}
{263}
THINGS CONNECTED WITH CHRIST RISEN
@Acts 1: 1 - 14
These verses bring out several great and blessed things which are characteristic of christianity. Not that christianity was really established till the Spirit was given on the day of Pentecost, but the things which are spoken of in this scripture are characteristic of christianity.
The death of Christ is the great basis on which christianity rests; everything for us begins from His death. This is what the apostle John meant when he said, "This is he that came by water and blood" (@1 John 5: 6). He does not there speak of His incarnation, but of His death. All true christian blessing is based on the death of Christ; all starts from there.
In the scripture I have read we find Him "after he had suffered". Many pious people adore the Lord in His pathway here and their hearts follow Him with intense interest to the foot of the cross, as they say, and there they seem to lose sight of Him. Such souls find great comfort in the thought that He died for them as poor sinners, but they do not really apprehend Him as the risen One; they have a measure of relief, but do not know divine rest and peace. We find here that "he presented himself living, after he had suffered, with many proofs".
It is right that we should dwell on the suffering of Christ. It shows what the world is as a system, and what man is as a fallen creature. The exceeding wickedness and darkness of man's heart was manifested by the way we treated that blessed One. He had done us nothing but good, but we nailed Him to a cross. Perhaps you think they were worse than we are? Beloved friends, do not make any such mistake. The same wickedness and enmity against God is in all
{264}
our hearts. Why did not I help to drive those nails? If I had lived at that time and in that place I might have been one of the very men to do it. I am wicked enough to do it.
Then again the darkness of man came out at the cross as well as his wickedness. There was full witness to that blessed One when He was here. All His words and works showed who He was. He was the Lord of glory, perfect, lovely, acceptable to God in every way, God's beloved Son, but men would not have Him. The world knew Him not and His own received Him not. Perhaps you say, 'But what about the little company who did receive Him?' Well, beloved friends, think of what came out in that company when tested. One betrayed Him, another denied Him, and all forsook Him. On man's side there was nothing but an utter breakdown.
But on His side what perfect grace and love! His presence here exposed the wickedness and darkness and weakness of man, but we may be sure that God would never have sent Him merely to expose this. He came to remove it all in the way of atonement. The black tide of man's wickedness rose to its flood, but it was met by the deep, full, glorious tide of divine grace, love and sovereign mercy. Christ suffered for sins and bore the condemnation of man as a creature full of the poison of sin. All that there was on our side -- sins, defilement, curse, death -- was taken up and borne by Him. Every question has been raised and settled in divine righteousness and love to the glory of God. Then what remains? *Christ* remains, the risen One. "He presented himself living, after he had suffered, with many proofs".
Then there was another thing. Christ brought all the blessing of God into this world in His own Person, but the disciples had to learn that the blessing that was in Him could not be transferred to man in the flesh, in whom there was nothing but sin. Christ had to go into death to remove that man sacrificially from before God. The disciples "hoped that *he* was the one who is about to redeem Israel" (@Luke 24: 21). They looked for divine blessing to be brought into the
{265}
present order of things. Men would like to link up Christ with themselves for the improvement and elevation of what they are as in the flesh. But this cannot be; man after the flesh must be removed in death, and in Christ's death he is removed from before God.
The world rejoices to get rid of Christ. "Ye shall weep and lament, ye, but the world shall rejoice; and ye will be grieved, but your grief shall be turned to joy ... ; but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one takes from you" (@John 16: 20, 22). When they saw Him alive from the dead, showing Himself by many infallible proofs, they had Him in a new and eternal character. No doubt it was most blessed to go about with Him and hear His gracious words and see His mighty acts, but that did not meet the question of sin or of death or remove the curse. But Himself alive after His suffering is the proof that all these things have been dealt with to the glory of God. If you look at that risen Man you will see what can never crumble away -- all the blessings of God's grace and the thoughts of His love established in One who is alive for evermore. When you see Him alive after His sufferings you rejoice, and your joy no man takes from you. I put it to you, beloved friends, do you know that resurrection joy? That is the true joy of Christianity.
Now we come to another thing. The risen One was seen of them forty days, and He was "speaking of the things which concern the kingdom of God" (verse 3). In @Romans 14: 17 we get the moral elements that make up the kingdom of God: "righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit". These are the things which have come in through the Lord Jesus Christ; they are established in Himself as the risen One. Have you righteousness? Many a believer would say, 'I am trusting the mercy of God through Christ'. But God would have you see that He has established righteousness for you in Christ. By the grace of God we are "in Christ Jesus, who has been made to us ... righteousness" (@1 Corinthians 1: 30).
{266}
If Christ is your righteousness is it not sufficient? Can Satan find a flaw in Christ? Can he suggest that there are questions which have not been settled?
You may think of all your failure, inconsistencies, feebleness of faith, etc., but if a risen Christ is your righteousness, all that, in a sense, disappears from view. You must either have your own righteousness or Christ. Have you any? 'No', you say, 'I have none; that is why I believed on Christ; I realised that none but He could save me'. Exactly! He is your righteousness. God wants you to look upon Him, to learn Him, to grow up in Him, to rejoice in Him and never turn back to think of yourself.
"Peace". You are brought outside the scene of disturbance and conflict. If Christ is your righteousness there is nothing to disturb from God, or from Satan, or from the world. You carry your own deep secret of peace through everything. You know God as the God of peace, and you judge yourself and apply the sentence of death to your own will.
"Joy in the Holy Spirit". This is the joy of knowing God in grace. You find God is the Fountain of living waters, the Source of infinite bliss. He has wrapped up every blessing for you in Christ, blessed you with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ, that is, in another Man, not in yourself. When you see that, you rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh. God known in grace has sway in your heart, not self-interest or self-indulgence.
But perhaps there is a backslider here who says, 'I once knew something of the joy of these things, but I have been so worldly and careless, and I am in such a bad state of soul that I cannot now find any pleasure in these things'. You seem to see a mountain of difficulty in the way of your restoration and think it is well-nigh impossible. But, dear friend, you are in a bad state of soul just because you have slipped away from all these blessed things, and therefore you have lost all power to be separate or holy. Well, go back, and begin by thanking God for His infinite grace to you. The great power
{267}
for recovery is to get a fresh sense of the grace of God. You imagine that you must work your way back to Him by a long process of confession, etc. Go to God just as you are and you will find that His grace is as much a reality as it ever was. Thank Him for it, and in the presence of His grace and love you will see what a fool you have been, and you will most deeply judge and loathe yourself. God will see on the altar of your heart the sacrifice of a broken spirit. In thanking God for His grace you will come again under the mighty sway of that grace. God's kingdom will be renewed in your soul.
We come now to a third thing, "the promise of the Father" (verse 4). We get the promise of the Spirit in @John 14: 26; @John 15: 26; and in these scriptures we see a double object to be attained by His coming. In @John 14 it is the inside effect -- that nothing of the knowledge of Christ should be wanting in the hearts of the disciples. The preciousness of Christ and the blessedness of all that He communicated would be kept in the affections of the saints by the Comforter. Then in chapter 15 it is the outside effect -- that nothing should be lacking in the testimony of Christ.
Someone may say, 'I am not worthy to receive the Spirit'. Of course you are not worthy, but if you would know on what ground God gives the Spirit, turn to @Leviticus 14: 14 - 17. The blood was put on the tip of the leper's right ear, etc., and then the oil (a type of the Spirit) was put upon the blood. The blood of Christ which cleanses you from all sin is the ground on which you receive the Spirit.
@Acts 1: 8 is connected with @John 15: 26. "Ye shall be my witnesses". Our only business is to be Christ's witnesses in walk and ways and word. Christian surely means 'Christ's one'. If Christ has got possession of us and His love holds us fast, to speak of Him will be the natural outflow of our hearts. It is not that you thrust yourself upon people, but you naturally speak as opportunity may arise of what fills your heart. It is your joy to speak of Christ. Then if Christ fills our hearts, He will give character to our lives. Our natural qualities and characteristics will get into the background and
{268}
more of Christ be seen. We shall become heavenly luminaries in this dark world.
The disciples asked, "Lord, is it at this time that thou restorest the kingdom to Israel?" They were slow to give up the thought of some greatness for man here, but the Lord says, as it were, 'No, it is not the time for Israel to be great, but for Me to be great in your hearts and in your testimony. Ye shall be My witnesses'. To make man in the flesh great is the devil's testimony; it will culminate in antichrist who will come in his own name and be received. Man would exalt himself but God will have none exalted but Christ. Paul was in the testimony of God when he said that his expectation and hope was that Christ should be magnified in his body. John the Baptist was on the same line when he said, "He must increase, but I must decrease".
There are three other things which I can only just touch upon. "He was taken up ..." (verse 9). Christ is now in heaven and as our hearts follow Him there we become heavenly. It has been said, If you look around there is distraction; if you look within there is contraction; but if you look above there is attraction.
Then, "This Jesus ... shall thus come" (verse 11). He is coming to bring the glory of God into this world. Many Christians are eating their hearts out over the evils that are here and trying to remedy them, instead of seeing that things here cannot be put right until Christ comes from the right hand of God to do it. It is right to feel the evils of the world and the ruin of the church, but we can only judge these things rightly as we are outside it all in heart and spirit, rejoicing "in hope of the glory of God".
Meanwhile the place of the christian company is the "upper chamber" and their occupation "continual prayer" (verses 13, 14). The disciples were outside what was of man in a religious way and they were in dependence on God. The temple was no longer the place for them, but the upper chamber. We are only passing strangers here; the "inn" of
{269}
@Luke 10: 34 is our place. The One who has brought every blessing to us is coming back, but meanwhile we are morally apart from the course of things here, outside the world even in its religious aspects. It is impossible to maintain this ground without continual prayer. May God give us grace to be found morally in the position and spirit of those who resorted to the "upper chamber"!
{270}
FROM C.A.C.¬S NOTES
@Acts 1: 1 - 26
We might call Acts the second volume of Luke. Luke was the salvation which began to be spoken of by the Lord, and Acts was what was "confirmed to us by those who have heard" (@Hebrews 2: 3). Luke was what He did, in Acts it is confirmed.
It is very interesting that both books are written to Theophilus; he was a Gentile, his name tells us that it means loved of God. So these books were written to a Gentile loved of God. "Excellent" is his title. In Luke he is addressed thus, but not here: it is beautiful to see that he had given up his title. The Holy Spirit is so very careful to give every person his title, his distinction; God recognises them in grace. The Christian is the most polite person possible; he always shows courtesy, honour to whom honour is due. Abraham bowed to the ground to the angels (@Genesis 18: 2); he might well do it to them perhaps, but you read in @Genesis 23: 7, 12 that he bowed down to the sons of Heth -- he showed them all the honour due to them. No one is so polite as the man of God. Theophilus evidently had a position or appointment in this world, just as Felix was addressed as "most excellent governor" (@Acts 23: 26). 'Excellent' was a title in those days as 'honourable' or 'right honourable' might be now. Joseph and Nicodemus were honourable councillors, members of the council, but they could never have gone back to the council after they had put the Lord's body in the grave. The Spirit always recognises a man's position, so Theophilus's position is clearly stated in Luke. But after he had learnt the gospel, he evidently gave up his position and title, so here he is plain Theophilus. It is beautiful when you see people give up a title or position, but dreadful to see a man accept a dignity from the world -- it is different to see it if he is born in it. If we accept anything from the world we lose. It was beautiful to see our young brothers refuse commissions or any dignity
{271}
and go into the ranks to serve. The world can make you a slave but it cannot make you accept honour.
You will notice the recurrence of the word "taken up", it is characteristic here; it follows on @Luke 24: 51. The gospel of Luke hinges on His being taken up. We have all noticed the division in the gospel after the Lord set His face to go up to Jerusalem to be received up (@Luke 9: 51). The whole character of things changes after that: everything depends on His death and resurrection and ascension, and everything comes to us from a risen Christ. He could forgive sins on earth (@Luke 5), but He could not have been the good Samaritan before He died. The whole character of the gospel changes. We could not know Him as the good Samaritan, He could not give the oil and wine. In the book of the Acts He sets us on His own beast. We get two aspects of the Holy Spirit. We get character and joy in the oil and wine. The oil is character. We had a character as natural men, now we get the Lord's character by His Spirit. The other aspect of the Holy Spirit is He set Him on His own beast. We get all from the risen Man who is received up into heaven. If the disciples had only known Christ on the cross, how miserable they would have been when He left them; they would wish they had never known Him; and we should be just as miserable if we had only known the cross. Christianity does not start with the cross though it is the basis of it: it starts with a risen and glorified Man received up into heaven.
The Lord did not go to heaven for forty days. Have you ever thought of that? What a wonderful thing that He stayed on earth those forty days, so that there might be many infallible proofs of His resurrection. We are risen with Christ though on earth, as we see in Colossians.
We get the two baptisms here (verse 5). In the first, the baptism of water, we are buried, we go out of sight. In the second, the baptism of the Spirit, Christ comes into sight and is seen in us by His Spirit. So in the one you go out, and in the other Christ comes in! If we could but enter into these things more, and yet they are all there for us!
{272}
"It is not yours to know times or seasons, which the Father has placed in his own authority". The Father keeps them in His own hands -- that shows we are not to be occupied with them. So many Christians go off on to a sideline, and get occupied with prophecies and dates and whether they are fulfilled or not. I daresay hundreds at this moment are trying to fit the war in with prophecy, and to see whether the war is mentioned in Scripture; but directly you do that you are off on a sideline. Nothing is so simple as Christianity, it is we who complicate things. Christianity is so simple, it is just a risen Man in heaven and we as witnesses to Him. Everything else is a sideline and you get off on it if you get occupied with times and seasons.
If you get a wrong thought, the more you took at it and twist it round, the more crooked it becomes. But if you get a truth from the Lord, the more you look at it the more beautiful it becomes. It is always so; you can test things that way, because wrong thoughts get more and more tangled as you examine them, but the truth shines more and more in the light. It is just like looking at things through a microscope -- divine things will bear to be looked at through a microscope, for God's work becomes more and more beautiful, but man's work looked at through a microscope becomes more and more coarse. The truth illuminated for us is like radium that becomes more and more beautiful -- it gives out waves and waves of light that radiate around; the light never diminishes but goes on increasing in waves.
"He was taken up, ... and a cloud received him out of their sight" (verse 9). They had nothing but clouds before the Holy Spirit came, but now there are no clouds. How often do we sing, 'No cloud or distance ere shall dim' and 'Not a cloud above'. We do not think of what we are singing. There was no cloud with Stephen; he looked up steadfastly and saw the Lord. That is where christianity puts us in full view of a glorified Christ. The Christian says, "We see Jesus, ... crowned with glory and honour" (@Hebrews 2: 9). When the Lord was leaving them He says, "The world sees me no longer;
{273}
but ye see me" (@John 14: 19). For many Christians a cloud has received Him out of their sight. He is gone from them and is nothing to them but the Christ of the gospels. One often hears that expression, how cold it is, the historical Christ of the gospels -- a cloud has hidden Him! But Stephen saw Him and witnessed to a risen Man in heaven. He not only witnessed by his words, "I behold ... the Son of man standing at the right hand of God" (@Acts 7: 56), but all the time the stones were pelting him his face was shining; they saw his face as the face of an angel. I believe if we saw the Lord in glory it would be reflected in us in that way. Every Christian's face should shine, you could not describe it but there would be something about it that would express the glory of God. At any rate we have it in Stephen, and if in one man why not in a second, and why not in me? We know very little about it, but shall we not pray that it may be so?
In verse 14 we get prayer. This company of one hundred and twenty were of "one accord". Accord means of one mind; they were all agreed in prayer. What a wonderful thing to think of one hundred and twenty all praying for the same thing! They had not the Spirit, but how much more should it be so now that the Spirit has come. The Lord is our perfect example: we see Him praying seven times in Luke's gospel. He prayed in such a manner that they said, "Teach us to pray". How wonderful to be taught by the Lord to pray! He does not teach us to say our prayers. Many Christians do that, and would not feel happy if they did not, but the Lord teaches us to pray. We pray when we want something from God. We need absolute dependence and prayer to keep us in the good of all we have been brought into.
Then there is another thing, the Scriptures. The apostles gave great attention to the Scriptures, they had companied with the Lord and seen that He did -- He could have given a scripture for everything He did if He had been asked. When Satan tempted Him He answered three times, "It is written". He could have spoken as God and said, 'I am God, depart from me, Satan', but He took the place of man in
{274}
dependence saying, "It is written". It would not have helped us if He had spoken as God.
Then they cast lots (verse 26). That was before the Holy Spirit came. It was right for them to do it, although it would not be right for us. Some do it now; they pray and then put a finger in the Bible and open at a text! But we have the Spirit so we could not cast lots. They were right, they put the whole thing at the Lord's disposal. "The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole decision is of Jehovah" (@Proverbs 16: 33).
They chose two who had companied with them and the Lord, the two most suitable. The Lord had said another was to fill Judas's place, so they had Scripture for it and acted on it.
Judas was a man who had preached and done miracles -- he had actually been with the Lord three and a half years and yet was not born again. How solemn! Judas was a man of note and looked up to by the disciples. It is amazing to think that all that time he was not converted.
{275}
THE GIFT OF THE SPIRIT
@Acts 2: 1 - 47
It is a great and precious fact that the Holy Spirit -- one of the Persons of the Godhead -- is now on earth, residing in the hearts of God's children and constituting their bodies His temple! Before such a thing could be, redemption had to be accomplished and Jesus glorified (@John 7: 39). It is consequent upon the death, resurrection and glorification of Jesus that the Holy Spirit has come, and now dwells in all those who have believed in the Lord Jesus for the remission of sins (@Acts 10: 43 - 45); it is they that believe on Him who receive the Spirit (@John 7: 39; @Acts 15: 7, 8; @Galatians 3: 2, 14; @Ephesians 1: 12 - 14). Because we are sons, God has sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, "Abba, Father" (@Galatians 4: 6; @Romans 8: 15); He sheds God's love abroad in our hearts (@Romans 5: 5); He makes our bodies His temple (@1 Corinthians 6: 19); He abides with us for ever, sealing us unto the day of redemption (@John 14: 16; @Ephesians 4: 30). He testifies of Christ (@John 15: 26); He convicts the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment (@John 16: 8 - 11); He makes intercession for us (@Romans 8: 26); and He is the earnest of glory (@2 Corinthians 1: 21, 22; @2 Corinthians 5: 5; @Ephesians 1: 12 - 14).
Then, further, He forms all believers on earth into one body (@1 Corinthians 12: 12, 13); for "there is one body, and one Spirit" (@Ephesians 4: 4). The church is the body of Christ. "We are members of his body" (@Ephesians 5: 30). Christ has been rejected from the earth and is no longer here personally, but His body is here to display in the power of the Spirit all His graces and moral perfections. It is evident that when this truth is apprehended it must operate powerfully to deliver Christians from sectarianism. Many sects and denominations have arisen, and every sect has its own *membership* distinct from the membership of every other sect. Thus divisions, so
{276}
strongly condemned by the Holy Spirit in @1 Corinthians 1: 10; @1 Corinthians 3: 4, are perpetrated in the church of God, and the true character of the church as the body of Christ is practically denied. Many Christians have felt this so deeply that they have been constrained to act upon the instructions given in @2 Timothy 2: 19 - 22, and to separate themselves from all sectarian bodies, refusing to take any name or to assume any position but such as in Scripture is common to all the children of God. Gathered simply in the Lord's name, they have found His presence with them, according to His word (@Matthew 18: 20), and they have been greatly blessed as they have sought to continue "in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers" (@Acts 2: 42). As these things are pursued together the truth of the "one body" finds expression in a definite way.

THE COMING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
@Acts 2: 1 - 47
C.A.C. The coming of the Holy Spirit is the most wonderful event in man's day. You might say the coming of Christ and the cross was the most wonderful thing; it was for God, on God's part, but the coming of the Holy Spirit is the most wonderful thing in man's day. What an amazing thing that God should come down and dwell in man! One cannot realise it.
We get the Holy Spirit here coming down as tongues of fire; it is very different from when He came down on the Lord Jesus; then it was as a dove. There never was a man like Him; He was the only Man who was ever meek and lowly in heart -- that was His character, and the dove was the emblem of that. When the Holy Spirit came down at Pentecost it was as tongues of fire in testimony. Fire consumes the flesh; there it was fire consuming all that man is and the Holy Spirit bringing in all that God is.
There was only one language originally. Did you ever think that Adam never had to learn to speak? Everyone else had to, but Adam never had to learn such things; he was a wonderful man. When the animals were brought to him he said, That is a lion and that is a bear. It was not like taking a child to the zoo and teaching him the animals¬ names! Adam named them by their characteristics, he knew how to name them. Until Babel they all spoke the one language that Adam spoke. Then they began to build a tower and said, 'We will get up to heaven'; and God said, 'I must go and see what they are doing'. So God came down and confounded their language. Languages are a sign of God's judgment. I have a book with a page of the Bible in different languages, and there are about two hundred. That is the judgment of God. We see a proof of that judgment in two people meeting,
{278}
one speaking French and another English. Now here comes in God's grace. The tongues of fire are for testimony to it, so that God's grace might be known to every poor sinner in every country in their own language.
When the law was given, three thousand men were killed (see @Exodus 32: 28)! But on the day of Pentecost in @Acts 2, three thousand dead men were made to live. That is the triumph of the gospel of God's grace going out to make dead sinners live.
There are sixteen different names of people here, and all heard the apostles preaching the gospel in their own tongues. God said, 'They shall hear about My Son in their own language'. He has come down and is speaking to men, and by His grace they all hear. All the representatives of these sixteen nations heard these Galileans speak in each of their different tongues; these foreigners understood their own languages and marvelled. But of course some Jews could not understand and it seemed utter nonsense to them. This was a foreshadowing of what was to be; the gospel would go out to the whole world but the Jews would not believe.
Then you see that directly the Spirit is in power the Scriptures are made plain. Peter refers to Joel, "I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh". The Jews wanted to keep everything to themselves; it was quite new to them that the Spirit should be poured out upon all flesh, but directly the Spirit was given there was at once an unfolding of Scripture. That is always a mark of the Spirit's presence. If there is confusion it is not of the Spirit, but when the Scriptures are brought out clearly it is the Spirit opening them up. We see it constantly when we let our minds work. If we speak with the natural mind we only make fools of ourselves; but if we let the Spirit teach us all is clear and plain. If a man is obscure in his teaching on Scripture it is obvious he is not led of the Spirit of God.
"I will give wonders in the heaven above" (verse 19). What more amazing wonder than that a Man is in heaven; that is
{279}
what we are shown. Then "signs on the earth below" -- God come down and indwelling man. What greater signs could there be! Is not that enough to make us wonder? Peter goes beyond himself at last and says, "Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved". He was under the control of the Spirit and was carried beyond himself. He did not know this for himself or he would not have needed the instruction of chapter 10. He did not know what 'whosoever' meant, and had to learn to spell it on the housetop! He was very slow in coming to it, though he preached to 'whosoever' here. It is often so with us; we speak of things we know nothing about in our souls. I have heard brothers speak of things they did not know in their souls, and perhaps later on one finds out they do not know the meaning of what they are talking about. If it is that a brother is carried beyond himself by the power of the Spirit, that is a very blessed thing, and one would like to hear more of it.
Ques. What does verse 20 mean?
C.A.C. It is the upheaval of everything; by and by all this will find its application in the kingdom. The sun is going to be seven times as bright as it is now, and the moon is going to be as bright as the sun.
We get in verses 22 and 23 God's estimate of Christ and man's estimate of Him. God's estimate was, "Jesus the Nazaraean, a man borne witness to by God to you by works of power and wonders and signs". That was a public approval, manifested to all; God showed forth His estimate by wonders and signs. Man's estimate was that by wicked hands He was crucified and slain. We get the result later on, "God has made him, this Jesus whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ". He is Lord to everyone, not only to believers. And as Christ He is Head to every man, woman and child.
Ques. Is that because of His death?
C.A.C. Yes, Satan was lord before. If Jesus had not come into the world Satan would be lord now, but God hath
{280}
made this same Jesus Lord and Head. We do not think enough of that.
"Thou wilt not leave my soul in hades, nor wilt thou give thy gracious one to see corruption" (verse 27). It was not possible that He could be holden of death because corruption is the victory of death. He is risen and He gained the victory. If the Lord had not risen great power would be in the hands of Satan.
We know what will be the issue when He takes up the conflict; all His enemies will be His footstool. And what about His friends? They will sit with Him on His throne. When the thrones of this world have crumbled to pieces, God's throne will still be standing and we shall be with Christ. It is so simple; if you bow to Him and confess Him now you will not have a pleasant time; you will be laughed at and persecuted, but it will only be for a very little while. By and by you will sit on His throne. But if you do not bow to Him and confess Him now, by and by you will have your place at the footstool of His feet. If we do not bow now we shall have to bow then. "I have sworn", says God, "Every knee shall bow" (@Isaiah 45: 23). We can overcome the deceitfulness of Satan now and confess Him, or if not there is only the footstool of His feet by and by, for the victory is assured for God. There is no uncertainty about the issue, all power is in His hands even now.
We get the whole gospel in verse 38. The remission of sins which is so much preached is only half the gospel. The positive side, that men should receive the Holy Spirit, is usually left out. It is striking when one considers how little the Holy Spirit is preached about: one seldom hears the gift of the Holy Spirit mentioned in a gospel preaching. There is something wrong in that when you consider the wonderful reality it is to receive the Holy Spirit, and yet it is rarely mentioned and only man's relief spoken of. I remember in one place where I preached about the Holy Spirit I was told afterwards that it was the first time that anyone had thought of the reception of the Holy Spirit.
{281}
Peter gets beyond himself again in verse 39 and says that the promise is to all "who are afar off"; that is, the Gentiles. He said it but he did not believe it.
Another thing we get in verse 40 that we do not hear preached is, "Be saved from this perverse generation". It is quite true we are to save ourselves; that is, by severing our connection with the world that crucified Jesus. We cannot have this world and the kingdom of God. It is not preached enough that we must renounce this world: we must save ourselves in that way. It was said also to Saul, "Arise and get baptised, and have thy sins washed away" (@Acts 22: 16).
Ques. What does that mean?
C.A.C. It means much the same. The world has crucified the Lord, and you sever your connection with it and with your past life of sin by being baptised. By baptism you say all your past history is closed; you publicly renounce your former life to put on Christ -- it is a public thing. If baptism is not preached the truth of it is not realised; but there must be the acceptance of it. There must be a public confession that you have done with the former life and put on Christ. By baptism you publicly renounce your life of sin and connection with this world; in that way you wash away your sins. It is difficult often for those who have been baptised as children; yet there comes a time with them when they have to make a clean break with the world and become true to their baptism.
The Jews recognise this. If a son is converted they do not take much notice, but if he is baptised he is dead to them; they will not speak to him or allow him to eat and drink with them. There are Jews in America now who believe in the Messiah and refuse baptism: they are apostate Jews, really unitarians. It is apostate judaism and christianity united.
{282}
THE TEACHING AND FELLOWSHIP OF THE APOSTLES
@Acts 2: 22 - 47
In this chapter we see christianity established here in the power of the Holy Spirit. Last week we were looking at some of the things which are characteristic of christianity as seen in chapter 1, but the coming of the Holy Spirit was needed to make them good intelligently and in power in the company of believers. It is of the greatest importance to see that the Holy Spirit has come. Many are occupied with the gift of the Spirit, and praying for a baptism of the Holy Spirit, but the fact is the Holy Spirit has come, and the great mark of His presence is the testimony He renders to Christ. The Lord Himself said, "*He* shall bear witness concerning me" (@John 15: 26), and the effect of His coming was that the apostles preached Christ in such a way that three thousand souls were converted in one day, and brought to continue in the apostles¬ teaching and fellowship, and in breaking of bread and prayers. It is in these things that christianity really consists.
Those who repent and believe the gospel are brought into them.
The effect of Peter's preaching of Christ on those who heard it was that, first they repented. That is, they judged themselves; they saw their exceeding wickedness in having crucified and slain Jesus their Messiah. Second, they received the divine testimony to Christ as risen and exalted, and were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus. Third, they received the Holy Spirit. These things are very great realities.
I hope I may take it for granted that all here have repented. You have judged yourself in God's presence as guilty and lost. Receiving God's testimony to Christ produces repentance. You see that God's Anointed has been rejected and put to death by men, and that shows you what is
{283}
in your own heart. They wanted to be without Christ; that is why they killed Him; and I have found the same thing in my own heart. It is good when God really brings this home to us, and we are pricked in the heart with conviction of sin.
What has God for such as repent? Well, He has Christ for all such. It is not merely some change or blessing in ourselves that we get, but Christ. God has no remedy, no resource, no blessing for man but Christ. Repentance and the reception of Christ lead to the great gain of having the Spirit. The apostles¬ teaching was the setting forth of Christ. I should like to call your attention to seven things which are found here, and which may be said to constitute the apostles¬ teaching.
First, Jesus the Nazaraean was "a man borne witness to by God". Christ is the subject of every divine testimony. Look at @John 5: 32 - 39. Here we see a fourfold witness to Christ -- that of John the Baptist, of His own works, of the Father and of the Scriptures. Every divine testimony really centres in Christ.
It is a great thing, beloved friends, to see that God's pleasure is to introduce that blessed Person to our hearts. God is set on filling us with blessing in Christ. We cannot find blessing anywhere but in Him, but we shall find everything to meet our consciences and satisfy our hearts if we receive God's witness to His beloved Son.
In @Psalm 81: 10 - 16 we see what God had in His mind for Israel, but they would have none of Him. They closed their hearts against His testimony. No doubt God will in a coming day bring them into blessing, but meantime we are in His thoughts for blessing. God is saying to us, "Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it". He is waiting to feed us with the finest of the wheat and to satisfy us with honey out of the rock. How important that we should not miss this! How careful should we be not to miss the blessed testimony of the Holy Spirit to Christ now! God has no blessing for us outside Christ -- no delight or pleasure but in Him.
{284}
Second, "Him, given up by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God" (verse 23). Why was He thus given up to death? Because if we were to be filled with blessing in Him, He must die to remove us and our sins. We have to see that that is the way that God has taken. God has, if I may so say, relieved Himself of all that in us which was obnoxious to Him. Sins were before Him -- Christ has become the propitiation for them. Man the sinner was there -- Christ has come in the likeness of sinful flesh and gone into death to bear his condemnation and to put him out of God's sight, not only in holy judgment but in holy love. God has been glorified about all we have done and all we are, and He can now speak to us of Christ. How near this brings the love of God to us when we see the way He has taken to set us aside so that He might fill us with the blessedness of Another, and that His own beloved Son! To know the love of God we must look at the cross. We can never measure its depths, but it is a delight to see that God, by the death of Jesus, has cleared the ground righteously so that we might be fully blessed in Him.
Third, "Ye, by the hand of lawless men, have crucified and slain" (verse 23). This shows us the place Christ has in the estimation of the world. He is not allowed a place here; He is disallowed indeed of men. So much so that if you find a person really giving Christ a place you feel sure it is a work of God. People think that things have changed because of the progress of religion, etc., but there is no place for Christ in the unconverted heart today any more than there was then.
The man who does not receive Christ is really in the same spirit as those who crucified Him. He says in his heart, 'I do not want Him, I have no room for Him'.
Is it not a wonderful thing, beloved friends, that the finger of God has touched us, and made room for Christ in our hearts? It is having Christ that puts the Christian outside the world, whether politically, socially or religiously. If he speaks of Christ to his political friends, or at the social party, all are made uncomfortable; a cloud comes over the scene
{285}
and he is told, 'This is not the place for such subjects'. It is the same in the religious circle. You may talk of the minister, the choir, the bazaar for charitable purposes, etc., but speak of Christ -- of His love, His death, His resurrection, His glory -- and there is no response; you find you are not wanted. There is no more place for Christ in the religious world of today than in the land where He was crucified. If Christ really has a place in your heart it will put you outside things here; you will find that you cannot go along with the world.
Fourth, "Whom God has raised up" (verse 24). Here we come to God's side. If on man's side He was rejected and slain, on God's side resurrection power was displayed. Everything that is for God now stands on the basis of resurrection. Everything here comes to an end by death. The best and fairest things here wither under death's terrible blight. But here we find a blessed Man who cannot be held by death. He has been raised up and is alive for evermore where sin and death can never come. He was cut off and had nothing here, but the Holy Spirit through Peter calls attention to the joy He has entered into in resurrection. See verses 26, 28. This is a quotation from @Psalm 16, which speaks of the joy of the Messiah in resurrection. When here, He was a Man of sorrows in a lowly path of grief and pain which ended in death, but He has entered into His joy in resurrection. Christ is the one "fairer than the sons of men". The beatitudes of @Matthew 5 find their only perfect fulfilment in Christ; He was the One poor in spirit, the One who mourned in presence of all the evil here, the meek One, the merciful, the One pure in heart, the peacemaker, and the One of all others who was persecuted and reviled for righteousness¬ sake.
And what did He get for it here? Was He rewarded by men, or indeed at all in the present order of things? No, beloved friends, His joys were in another scene. He said to His disciples, "Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens" (@Matthew 5: 12). He entered into His joy in resurrection (see @Psalm 21: 3 - 6). Think of the exceeding joy of
{286}
Christ in resurrection! You have doubtless often prayed for spiritual joy, but the way the Holy Spirit would bring you into it would be by leading you to see that Christ has entered into all that was in the purpose of God for man, and this in resurrection, that it might be secured for you in Him. He has entered as Man into all that is spoken of in @1 Corinthians 2: 9, 10 as "things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that love him, but God has revealed to us by his Spirit". Christ has entered in resurrection into all this; it is all established in Him, and the Spirit reveals it to us down here that we may have as heavenly light what soon shall be our part.
The disciples must have had the thought that when Christ got a place here they would share it with Him. But He gets a place *there* and shares that place with His own. He has companions in His joy; God has anointed Him with the oil of gladness above His companions. He has sanctified us by His death in order that we might share His joy. Is it not a wonderful thing to belong to such a Person, and to have such a portion with Him? But, remember, it is all on the resurrection side.
Fifth, "Having therefore been exalted by the right hand of God" (verse 33). Christ is rejected here, but exalted there. Men try to make it appear as if Christ had a place on earth -- a place of honour here -- but it is not so. The world that cast Him out and slew Him now builds costly and magnificent edifices professedly in His name. It is the old principle: the fathers killed the prophets, and the children built their sepulchres. But the Christian is not deceived by this. He knows Christ to be still despised and rejected by men, but he knows Him as the One whom God has highly exalted and set at His right hand. As we learn that He is not here our hearts turn to Him there, and our minds are set on things above where Christ sits at the right hand of God.
It is said of the German emperor that once on the occasion of a banquet he took his place by mistake at the wrong end of
{287}
the table. When the attendants pointed out to him that the head of the table was the other end, he replied, 'Where I sit is the head of the table'. Where Christ sits is the 'head of the table' for us. If He were here this would be our place, and the home of our hearts. But He is not here; He is at the right hand of God. How sad that a Christian should be found taken up with the politics or religion of the world, or mixing socially with those who give Christ no place!
Sixth, "Having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which *ye* behold and hear" (verse 33). How true it was of Christ that He loved righteousness and hated wickedness! He showed it by going to the cross to establish righteousness and to put away iniquity. And now He has been anointed with the oil of gladness that He may share that anointing with His companions. He has received the Holy Spirit as Man that He might shed Him forth on us. How wonderful to see that there is a heavenly company on earth having part in the anointing of that blessed Man at the right hand of God!
Seventh, "God has made him, this Jesus whom *ye* have crucified, both Lord and Christ" (verse 36). All the rights and authority of God are set forth now in the Lord Jesus. He is Lord. There are poor dupes of Satan who will not give divine honours to the Lord Jesus. Such do not honour God at all. Then, on the other hand, Jesus is the Christ -- God's anointed One to bring to pass all the thoughts and purposes of God with regard to the blessing of man. God has had counsels and purposes of blessing for man from all eternity, and Jesus is the anointed Man by whom all will surely come to pass. He was Lord and Christ, but in the days of His flesh His glory was veiled. Now it is manifested by the place in which God has set Him at His own right hand. He is Lord and Christ.
These seven things are what the Spirit witnesses of Christ, and they constitute the apostles¬ teaching. It was in this that the three thousand souls "persevered". It was this teaching which formed the fellowship. The One who is Lord and Christ is the Bond of the fellowship. The apostles¬ teaching
{288}
was the testimony of God, and those who received it came into the fellowship of christianity. Christian fellowship is not merely with a local company; it is the fellowship of all those who persevere in the apostles¬ teaching. There is but one fellowship. Every saint on earth is called by God to the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord. This was the fellowship formed by the apostles¬ teaching; that is, by the reception of God's testimony to the crucified, risen and exalted Christ. It was a fellowship quite distinct from the religious world around, in which man in the flesh had a recognised place. It was a fellowship based on the entire setting aside of man in the flesh in the death of Christ, and it subsisted in the knowledge and confession of the exalted Man at the right hand of God. This is the fellowship to which we are called, the true and only fellowship of the assembly of God.
The apostles¬ teaching and the fellowship are intimately bound up together, and then in close connection with them we have "breaking of bread and prayers". The Lord's supper had a great place in their hearts and it became a new rallying-point for them. The temple was the rallying-point in judaism, and while the Lord was with His own He was their rallying-point. But now the temple was desolate and the Lord was gone. What remained? Well, for one thing, the christian company remained, persevering in the apostles¬ teaching and fellowship. And another thing remained: the Lord's supper. He had instituted it on the night of His betrayal, leaving it, so to speak, in place of Himself, as His own way of bringing His saints together in His absence.
If we have been brought in any small measure into the fellowship, I am sure we shall delight to recognise the peculiar place and importance of the Lord's supper. The voice of His love says, "This do in remembrance of me". We cannot be in the fellowship without loving the Lord and loving His own who are in the world. If we do so we shall surely regard the Lord's supper as an institution of the highest importance,
{289}
for it is that which puts us in a special way in presence of His love, and which brings us together as those who love one another. We do not break bread as an ordinance, or as a means of grace, but in response of heart to the voice of His love. He is pleased to bring us together in this blessed way that He may bring Himself before our hearts. We meet our brethren there in the presence of divine love. We are brought together in the holy unity of the love of Christ for the remembrance of Himself. And in doing this we become His memorial here. "For as often as ye shall eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye announce the death of the Lord, until he come" (@1 Corinthians 11: 26).
"And prayers". In such a position as we are called to, there is absolute need for dependence and confidence in God, of which prayer is the expression. We cannot stand in a divine position or walk in a divine path by our own power. The more we seek to keep Christ's word and not deny His name, the more we shall feel our utter weakness and dependence. 'As weaker than a bruised reed, we cannot do without Thee'. We must persevere in prayers.
May we have grace in this difficult day to persevere in the apostles¬ teaching and in the fellowship! The natural consequence of this will be that we shall seek to take up our privilege in the breaking of bread; and the confidence of our hearts in God, with a sense of our own weakness, will find expression in prayers.
{290}
THE MYSTERY OF LAWLESSNESS AND THE TESTIMONY OF GOD
@Acts 2: 42 - 47
Many believers, instead of waiting for God's Son from heaven, are looking for revivals and the conversion of the world. That our minds may be disabused of vain expectations in this direction, I desire to bring before you the fact that the prophetic future of the church, viewed as in responsibility upon earth, instead of being bright with increasing spiritual prosperity, is dark with abounding evil and final apostasy. I wish to trace in Scripture the history of christendom from the freshness of Pentecost through ages of decline and departure, to its certain future apostasy and fall.
In @Acts 2: 42 - 47, we see the assembly as first formed on earth in the power of the Holy Spirit. Many fail to see the declension because they have no divine thought before their minds of what the assembly is according to God. The more we know of the assembly's heavenly calling and character according to the purpose of God, the more conscious do we become of its present failure and ruin outwardly. When the foundation of the second temple was laid by the remnant of Jews who returned from captivity, there was a shout of joy and a noise of weeping. The young people shouted for joy because they had never seen anything better, but the old men who had seen Solomon's temple in its beauty and glory wept much, because, as Haggai tells us, the second temple was as nothing in their eyes.
It is a great thing to see the house as originally set up, though the contemplation of it may constrain us to feel the present ruin as we have never felt it before. In @Acts 2 we see the house in its original beauty. The Lord Jesus, having accomplished eternal redemption, has ascended on high and taken His seat at the right hand of God. There, as the exalted
{291}
Man, He had received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, and had poured Him out to dwell in His saints, and to form them into a habitation for God. God desired to dwell in blessing and testimony among men, and thus to have His character expressed in this world. This is the true and proper character of God's house viewed from the divine side, and as composed only of "living stones". It is a spiritual house; a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ; and a royal priesthood to show forth God's excellencies before men in this world (@1 Peter 2).
But the assembly, viewed in its responsibility upon earth, has grievously failed to hold this ground, or to maintain this testimony. Man's failure opened the way for Satan's devices, and according to the parable, "While men slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel" (@Matthew 13: 25), and the result has been that the church, instead of being composed only of "living stones", is now a mixed mass of profession in which the human element vastly preponderates over the divine. It has become like "a great house" in which are vessels to dishonour as well as to honour. It is in this external aspect, as in responsibility upon earth, that we are now regarding the church, and we shall see that instead of extending the kingdom of Christ until the knowledge of the Lord shall cover the earth as the waters cover the sea, it is destined to close its career on earth in a condition of complete apostasy.
In @Acts 2 we find the saints gathered together in divine simplicity. Driven from the world, and drawn to each other, by the constraint of common sorrows and joys, believers were found together in the blessed exercise and experience of brotherly love. The name of the Lord Jesus was the bond of their fellowship, and God dwelt in them by the Spirit.
Let us now read @Matthew 13: 33. Most of us are aware that this parable is often brought forward as teaching that the gospel will spread until the whole world shall be filled with the knowledge of God. But the fact is that *leaven* in Scripture
{292}
always represents something evil. In the sacrifices and offerings of the ceremonial law it was always typical of evil, and whenever the offering was typical of Christ -- the Holy One of God -- there must be no leaven. Leaven is mentioned thirteen times in the New Testament, and in eleven instances no one doubts that it is used in a bad sense -- the leaven of the Pharisees, and of Herod, the leaven of malice and wickedness, etc. Can we suppose, if in eleven out of thirteen instances leaven refers to that which is evil, that in the two passages (@Matthew 13: 33; @Luke 13: 21) which contain this parable it means something good? None but those who are committed to the support of an unscriptural system of theology would entertain such a thought for a moment.
Then what do we learn from this parable? Certainly not the universal propagation and ultimate triumph of the gospel. No, we see the working and development of *hidden* wickedness. We thus learn that the professing church would be the scene of increasing, and finally universal, wickedness. I believe the woman represents the seductive power of evil in spiritual things. We shall see her again as we pursue our inquiry into these solemn matters. For the moment, let us seek to apprehend the significance of this prophetic picture. Taking this parable as our starting point, shall we not expect to find in the profession of christianity the introduction of a principle of evil that, hidden at first, will secretly extend its pernicious influence until the whole mass of profession shall be thoroughly corrupt? This is the only conclusion to which we can come, and we will now briefly trace the gradual extension of this corrupting influence to its final issue in the complete apostasy of that which has borne the name of Christ.
In @Acts 2 the assembly's principles and practice were as far removed from those of the world as heaven is from earth. Believers were linked together by a bond of holy love which made each one glad to forget himself in ministering to the need of others. The interests of Christ were pre-eminent in
{293}
every heart, and in gladness and singleness of heart the disciples "persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers".
But Satan, ever active in opposition to the work of God, soon found occasion to corrupt the saints from their simplicity. As early as @Acts 6 the first indications of decline made their appearance; "There arose a murmuring". The spirit of self-seeking began to replace that of self-sacrifice. The first sign of failure was a failure in love. I pass over the case of Ananias and Sapphira as being entirely an individual matter. In @Acts 2 and 4 the disciples were all filled with the Holy Spirit, but in @Acts 6 when seven deacons had to be appointed, the apostles told the disciples to *look out from among themselves* seven men full of the Holy Spirit. In @Acts 6, men filled with the Holy Spirit had to be *looked for*. This is very significant.
Then when we come to the epistles what do we find? That one was written because the assemblies in Galatia were turning their backs upon Christ and going in for ritualism and law-keeping; that another was written because the assembly at Corinth was becoming a scene of licentiousness and sectarianism; that a third was written because the saints at Colosse were in danger of being drawn away by philosophy and vain deceit; in that to the Philippians, Paul had to say that all sought their own things, and not the things of Jesus Christ; and in that to Timothy he spoke of all in Asia having turned away from him. And we may notice in connection with the parable in @Matthew 13 that in writing to Corinth and Galatia, Paul speaks of the evil that was among them as *leaven*. Is it too much to suppose that the parable was in the apostle's mind as he penned or dictated the words?
Now turn a moment to @2 Thessalonians 2: 1 - 8. Some at Thessalonica were contending that the day of the Lord was then present. The saints were passing through much persecution, and some were leading them to think that their afflictions were judgments connected with the day of the Lord,
{294}
and consequently that the day of the Lord was then present. No, said the apostle, the day of the Lord shall not come "unless the apostasy have first come". Let those who say that the day of the Lord shall be brought in by the spread of the gospel and the conversion of the world read this verse and cease to dream of a progressive and triumphant church. "It will not be unless the apostasy have first come". It is a solemn fact of Scripture that the prophetic future of the church on earth is apostasy.
And mark what follows! "The mystery of lawlessness already works". A mystery is a hidden thing. The woman *hid* the leaven. It was a "mystery of lawlessness" which in Paul's day was already working; the leaven was spreading. I cannot enlarge on these deeply solemn and instructive statements of connected Scripture, but I commend them to your prayerful study.
Now turn for a moment to @2 Timothy 3: 1 - 5. The Holy Spirit gives here a prophetic picture of the last days. Strange that people should dream of a prosperous and progressive church, with such a passage before them. Many forms of wickedness are here named as being characteristic of those who, in the last days, have the form of godliness; that is, of the professing church. The increasing display of the working of the mystery of lawlessness, the further development and spread of the leaven, is thus clearly seen.
Let us now pass on to @Revelation 2 and 3. Under figure of addresses to seven Asian assemblies, we have seven stages of the church's history in view. In the address to Ephesus, the church in the apostolic age is contemplated. There was much faithfulness, energy, and devotedness, which the Lord owns and commends. Nevertheless He speaks to them as a "fallen" assembly because they had forsaken their first love. Christ no longer *filled* their hearts. This is the state of which the apostle complained when he said, "All seek their own things, not the things of Jesus Christ" (@Philippians 2: 21).
Then in the address to Smyrna, we get the Lord's word of encouragement to the church in persecution and distress.
{295}
During the first three centuries the saints suffered much persecution which, for the time, cast them upon the Lord and stayed the progress of corruption within.
Afterwards the church became worldly, and is viewed in the address to Pergamos as dwelling where Satan's throne was. Satan is the prince of this world. About the beginning of the fourth century the church became a great power in the world. The emperor Constantine assumed the profession of christianity, and promulgated his new religion by imperial edict through every part of the vast empire. For the first time, also, we first find the doctrine of Balaam in the church, and the running greedily after error *for reward* has been the blight and bane of the church ever since. Thenceforward the church entirely departed from the place of strangership and pilgrimage here, and became a *dweller* on the earth.
Then in Thyatira, popery is in view. Read verse 20; "the woman Jezebel". It was a woman who hid the leaven; here we meet with her again, and shall see more of her presently. She is carrying on her corrupting work, as in @Matthew 13, teaching the servants of God to commit fornication, and to eat things offered to idols. The leaven spread until that which bore the name of Christ became a corrupt and idolatrous system. It is a matter of common notoriety that for hundreds of years the public church was the foulest blot of moral pollution that could be found on earth. Under the cloak of religion every conceivable iniquity was practised. In saying this, it must not be forgotten that God had His chosen ones all along -- "the rest who are in Thyatira" -- but the church as a whole was the home of gross iniquity, and, as a rule, as men advanced in ecclesiastical position, they became more and more unscrupulous.
Passing on to Sardis (@Revelation 3: 1 - 6), I have no doubt we see the Lord's mind as to Protestantism. The Reformation was, in many respects, a great work of God. By its means the Scriptures were spread abroad, and along with the opening up of Scripture came light from God as to the sinful condition of man, and the necessity for *justification by faith*. This broke
{296}
the power of priestcraft and superstition by exposing the worthlessness of masses, penances, indulgences, and all the cunning devices by which the church held the consciences of men in bondage, and secured their money and lands for herself. But Protestantism soon degenerated into little more than a great political movement. Its principles and faith were widely professed by people and nations who for personal or political reasons desired to escape from the thraldom of Rome. Consequently, though much divine light had been vouchsafed and "received and heard", the works of Protestantism were not found "complete before my God". "I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead". These words too truly describe the vast majority of Protestants today, though "thou hast a few names in Sardis which have not defiled their garments, and they shall walk with me in white, because they are worthy".
In Philadelphia we see a company of saints for whom the Lord has no word of censure. They have kept His word, and have not denied His name; they have kept the word of His patience. The fact that they thus stand true to what is of Christ shows that they have a "little power". It may be little, nothing to make any show, or to be of any account in the religious world, but there is power to maintain what is of God. Thus amid the deepening shades of the mystery of iniquity, we find a remnant identified with the testimony of God.
The Son of God has brought a most blessed testimony into this world: the revelation of God in supreme grace and love -- the Father. His "word" is the revelation of Himself and of the Father. Blessed, indeed, is the portion of those who keep that word! The obligation to be true to His name comes in in a special way because of His rejection. God would have His saints to maintain, by the Holy Spirit, what is due to the One who is holy and true.
It is well that we should bear in mind the character of holiness which pertains to Christ as the risen and glorified One. He has laid down the life which He had as a Man upon
{297}
earth, closing up in death before God the life of flesh and blood, to which in us sin attached. Personally He "knew not sin", but sacrificially He was made sin for us. Now He has taken His life again in a condition to which sin never did, or could, attach. He is now "separated from sinners", and entirely apart from the life of flesh and blood. Risen and glorified, He is the Holy One, the Sanctifier, and the Firstborn of a company of holy brethren, who derive from Him and are "all of one" with Him, in new creation. He has sanctified Himself for us, that we may also be sanctified by truth (@John 17: 19).
He is "the holy, the true". There is in Him the complete setting forth of God. He is the "image of the invisible God", and "in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily" (@Colossians 1: 15; @Colossians 2: 9). We do not need to go outside that blessed Person for anything. It is He who has accomplished all that was needed that we might lift up our hearts in righteousness and joy before the Father's face. If we would learn the measure of our sanctification and acceptance we can only learn it in Him, and if we would know God, it is in the face of Jesus Christ that all His glory shines. The whole testimony of what God has brought to pass for His own pleasure in the blessing of His chosen saints is set forth in that risen and glorified One. And the complete revelation of God in His blessed nature and attributes is also set forth in Him. So that to keep His word, and not deny His name, is really to stand in the full grace and blessing of christianity.
The Lord says also to Philadelphia, "Thou hast kept the word of my patience". I think this comes in by way of contrast to that which has been characteristic of both popery and Protestantism. Both the latter have striven to have a place and name on earth. They have sought to connect themselves with the world powers; either, on the one hand, to control those powers, or, on the other, to be supported by them. But the christian company approved by the Lord, in contrast to this, keeps the word of His patience. I understand this to be the recognition of the fact that Christ is rejected
{298}
from the earth, and has no place here except in the hearts of His saints. He has right to everything, but possession of nothing. He sits in patience at God's right hand until the hour when His foes will be made His footstool. The Christian cannot be asserting his rights, or making himself prominent, or seeking place and honour in the scene of Christ's rejection. He must be consistent with "the patience of the Christ" (@2 Thessalonians 3: 5).
For such, and these are the characteristics of the whole company of saints on earth, viewed according to God, deliverance is promised "out of the hour of trial, which is about to come upon the whole habitable world, to try them that dwell upon the earth". Before the seals are broken, the trumpets sounded, or the vials poured out, the Lord will remove His own from the earth. No infliction of wrath from God can come upon those composing the assembly. "Having been now justified in the power of his blood, we shall be saved by him from wrath" (@Romans 5: 9). Before any infliction of wrath from heaven, the assembly will be translated to heaven. See @1 Thessalonians 4: 13 - 18. There is no prophetic event, no long or short interval of prophetic time, to come before the rapture of the assembly. It is immediately in view; and hence the Lord says, "I come quickly: hold fast what thou hast, that no one take thy crown".
Are we conscious of having received from God the light and joy of what He has established in Christ? Have we received of the fulness, and contemplated the glory, of that blessed One? Have we seen in His face the glory of God? Have we known what it was to be taken in spirit out of the world, and away from self, and from the influences which emanate from man here, by the attractiveness and blessedness of that One in glory? Have we tasted and known "the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge" (@Ephesians 3: 19)? If so, then, "hold fast what thou hast, that no one take thy crown".
God would have every saint on earth to be a Philadelphian. He would have all His children separate from the world, and
{299}
in the intelligence of His mind and pleasure. He would make Christ everything to us, so that we might be delivered from every kind of evil, and from every variety of religious flesh. And His love is good to the *feeblest* heart. If we desire to know His mind, and to stand perfect and complete in all His will, He will not fail to strengthen us, and make us divinely competent to receive what is of Himself. In Christendom there is much strength for display on earth, and for religious activity, but where do we see the knowledge and maintenance of God's purpose and grace as set forth in Christ risen and glorified? Indeed, in Christendom, man in the flesh is more important and prominent than anywhere else. How good it is, that by divine grace we may have "a little power", and thus be enabled to keep the word, and not deny the name of the One who is "the holy, the true"! May God grant this grace to each one of us!
Laodicea presents the final aspect of things before the Lord spues the whole corrupted profession of Christianity out of His mouth. Boastfulness and self-satisfaction characterise this church, of which the Lord says, "Thou art the wretched and the miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked". It is full of man's pretension and assumption, and *Christ is outside*. We cannot look abroad today without seeing the marks of Laodicea on every hand. Everything divine reduced to man's level, or to a level where man supposes he can reach it. Higher criticism (to its own satisfaction) has pretty well disposed of the miraculous element in Scripture. Men are encouraged to think for themselves. Anything in Scripture which the natural man can adopt, or adapt to himself in any way, may be allowed to claim a certain kind of inspiration. But everything outside this -- that is, everything distinctively of God -- is swept aside as purely mythical or figurative, or as only attributable to the ignorance of an unenlightened age.
But where is Christ in all this man-exalting system? Where is the cross? Where the recognition that man in the flesh in his best form, educated, cultivated, moral, or religious, is offensive to God? Where is it proclaimed that Christ alone,
{300}
the second Man, out of heaven, fills the eye and heart of God with pleasure, and that all other men present before God the utter moral ruin of fallen and lost creatures? These divine thoughts and realities are totally unknown in Laodicea, or only known as subjects of derision. *Man* is everything in Laodicea; Christ, the Christ of God, is nothing.
Yet still He stands at the door and knocks. There may be an aching and unsatisfied heart somewhere in that circle where self-complacency and pride predominate. So He will knock at the door which excludes Him, and He will speak in grace even to Laodicea. "If any one hear my voice and open the door, I will come in unto him and sup with him, and he with me".
It is instructive to observe that the course of apostasy divides itself into two great streams. Thyatira represents one of those streams, and Laodicea the other. One is the vast current of superstition, idolatry, and fleshly religion which we see full-blown in popery, and which is known in this country as ritualism. The other is rationalism, which assumes the competency of the human mind to investigate, and to pronounce upon, the things of God. Both agree to exclude Christ. Ritualism makes much of man in the flesh as a religious being. Rationalism makes much of him as an intellectual being. The truth of christianity is that man in both aspects is under death and judgment as offensive to God, and that nothing avails before God but a new creation in Christ Jesus.
Every professed Christian is either on the line that man in the flesh can be something for God, or on the line that Christ is everything, and that man in the flesh is nothing. That is, every professed Christian is either identified with Thyatira or Laodicea on the one hand, or with Philadelphia on the other.
Sardis may be regarded as an intermediate state, but practically Protestantism as we see it today partakes of the character of either Thyatira or Laodicea. Protestantism was produced by the introduction of a measure of divine light, and also by the revolt of natural conscience against the errors
{301}
and enormities of Rome. But in Protestantism generally there was no recognition of the fact that man in the flesh was entirely set aside for God in the death of Christ, and that saints were before God for His pleasure only as being "in Christ Jesus", in new creation. Hence in the reformed churches generally the sacramental system was retained, the distinction between clergy and laity was still recognised, and provision was made for the mass of the people, whether converted or not, to take part in the worship. Man in the flesh was still recognised as having status before God, and the result of this has been that Protestantism generally has either fallen back in the direction of ritual and popery, or it has moved forward into rationalism. It has become assimilated in character either to Thyatira or to Laodicea.
What gives peculiar and distinctive character to Philadelphia is that God's mind is known there. It is composed of those who stand in the true grace and blessing of christianity. According to the divine mind, every true saint belongs to Philadelphia. Alas! as a matter of fact, many converted persons are still entangled with that in which God finds no pleasure. They have not reached, in the apprehension of their souls, a circle where "Christ is everything, and in all" (@Colossians 3: 11). God cares for such and feeds them, but they are babes having need of milk. They have not reached christian maturity. Their knowledge of the grace of God is imperfect, and they are not at all acquainted with His purposes as established and set forth in Christ risen and glorified. Every full-grown Christian is a Philadelphian. Of course, one who had touched it might be diverted from it. Hence the warning, "Hold fast what thou hast, that no one take thy crown".
As to the course of the apostasy after the rapture of the church my remarks must necessarily be brief. Deprived of every true member of the body of Christ, and spued out of His mouth as nauseous to Him, the history and doom of the apostate church is seen in @Revelation 17 and 18. Here we see the woman again. She has at last brought her corrupting
{302}
influence to a successful climax. She rides upon a scarlet-coloured beast which represents the temporal and imperial power; see verses 12, 13. "And upon her forehead a name written, Mystery". Here we see the full result of the working of the hidden leaven, the mystery of lawlessness. The woman, typical of the seductive power of evil in connection with spiritual things, has succeeded in so corrupting christianity that it retains no trace of its divine origin, but becomes the masterpiece of abomination. Then in consummated apostasy she exclaims, "I sit a queen, and I am not a widow, and I shall in no wise see grief" (@Revelation 18: 7). Brief will be the hour of her triumph, and terrible her overthrow. God has decreed that as she loved to lord it over the temporal powers, those powers shall be the means of her destruction. "The ten horns which thou sawest, and the beast, these shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her with fire". "For this reason in one day shall her plagues come, death and grief and famine, and she shall be burnt with fire; for strong is the Lord God who has judged her" (@Revelation 18: 8).
So far as real Christians are concerned, the effect of seeing this should be to separate us more distinctly from the course of things which tends to apostasy. And we shall only be preserved from the influences which tend in that direction as we stand in the grace and power of christianity according to the mind of God. May we be found keeping the word of Christ, and not denying His name, and keeping the word of His patience! Thus shall we be preserved from the influences which tend in the direction of apostasy.
{303}
THE NAME OF JESUS
@Acts 3: 1 - 26
C.A.C. The first thing the name of Jesus does is to put a man right on his feet. This man was born lame, he had never walked. It was his state that was in question; he had always sat outside the temple at the gate. He had never been in, he could not approach God. It was against the law that anything deformed should enter the temple. You can never enter into privilege until you are right in responsibility. Until this man could walk he could not enter the temple, he could only sit at the gate. The name of Jesus gives him power to walk, "His feet and ankle bones were made strong". He is set up in a new way in the Spirit, the power of the name of Jesus does it. Then he leaps as well as walks; that is, exuberance of life. And he praises God; that is, he traces it all to God. He did not think, What a fine fellow I am! He had only looked in at the beautiful gate before, now he can enter in (verse 8).
Silver and gold are the power of this world, but the name of Jesus is in contrast. We want the power of His name to enable us to walk: His name is all that He is. It is not what you say but how you walk that is a testimony. It is your life that affects others, not your talk: if you are still hobbling along on lame feet it is no good at all.
Ques. Is it a walk with God that is needed?
C.A.C. Walking with God is privilege, it is communion. Walking before God is responsibility; if you do that you are perfect. It was said to Abram, "Walk before my face, and be perfect". If you have God before you, you will walk perfectly; if you get out of His presence you fall, and you have to judge it and return to walk before God. Then you will be a testimony to the power of the name of Jesus: the power of the name of Jesus is the point in this part of the chapter.
{304}
This man had never walked; he was crippled from his birth. It is like, "We have turned every one to his own way". By nature we cannot walk, but the power of the name of Jesus gives us complete soundness (verse 16). You may say, Christians do not walk right, but that is because they are not under the power of the name of Jesus.
Ques. What is it to be under the power of the Name?
C.A.C. I think the Name implies His absence. You may not think of a person when he is with you, but if he is absent his name recalls all that he is to you: it suggests the person. So the Lord's name brings to us all the power that is in the Person; the Spirit brings it to us. There is a glorified Man in heaven and there is power in Him for everything. We could not be in any circumstances -- persecution or anything else -- where His power was not enough for us.
The Lord was rejected first, and in this chapter His name is rejected. In chapter 7 the Spirit is rejected: "Ye do always resist the Holy Spirit".
Notice in verse 11 that the man held Peter and John; he would not let them go. If you get spiritual blessing, hold on to the one whom you get it from; that is, seek the company of those who help you; it is very important. But then Peter had to make it plain that the blessing had nothing to do with him, but that it was in the power of the Name. So we have to recognise that all that comes to us in the way of help is of God and comes from Him. There is no man holy in himself, or who can help us of himself.
How amazing it is to consider the grace of God! What a wonderful verse verse 17 is! What grace after the most atrocious act that ever was done in this world, that it was put down to ignorance! Then in verse 20 the Jews are offered to have the Lord back ("he may send Jesus Christ"). Even then the Lord would have come back if they would have received Him, but they reject the offer. His name is rejected. We see Him standing until then, waiting to see if they will receive Him. Stephen saw Him standing, but they rejected the Spirit
{305}
then, and the Lord has sat down and will sit until His enemies are made the footstool of His feet. He sits until He rises up and shuts the door. He will rise too to receive His saints.
Verse 21 is taken by the universalists as their great text; they cut the head off the verse and leave the body! They take the restitution of all things and leave out the end (verse 23) following on not hearing what the prophet spoke of: "Whatsoever soul shall not hear that prophet shall be destroyed from among the people". That is the end of those who do not hear. If Jesus had been received the millennium would have been there, and the restitution of all things, but they would not receive God's wonderful offer of grace. Jesus was actually offered to them again after all their wickedness. Then in verse 26, "To you first God, having raised up his servant, has sent him, blessing you in turning each one of you from your wickedness". The worst possible people in the world had the first opportunity of blessing. Just think of the grace of God! We should have said, 'Let the Gentiles have it, not these horrible people'! Instead of that, Jesus is sent first to bless them, and not in their sins but in turning them away from their wickedness. That is the only way of blessing. Even then Jesus would have come if they would have received Him. We cannot conceive of or realise fully the amazing grace of God.
There is a great deal about the prophets in this chapter; God thinks great things of His prophets: we read of them in verses 18, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25.
{306}
EVIDENCE OF THE SPIRIT'S PRESENCE
@Acts 4: 8 - 12; @Acts 5: 3 - 6; @Acts 6: 1 - 5
Rem. The last time we were together we were taken up with the testimony of the Holy Spirit and the idea of the house.
Ques. They spoke in the power of the Spirit in chapter 2: 4. Peter's address was by spiritual power. In chapter 2: 33 it speaks of the Holy Spirit being poured out, which "ye behold and hear". What did they see? Would it be the effects of the Spirit on the one hundred and twenty?
C.A.C. Yes, I thought so. It says, "each one heard them speaking in his own dialect" and yet they recognised that they were Galileans; they were in the presence of power that was divine.
Ques. Peter refers to the Old Testament Scriptures; is it the evidence of the Spirit in Peter?
C.A.C. Yes, I think so. His course is marked by wisdom.
Evidences of the Spirit are marked by wisdom; it is the Spirit of wisdom. It is a great thing that the presence of the Spirit should come into evidence. We may assert a great many true things about the Spirit and His presence and power, but what marked Pentecost was that things were not there in doctrine but in power.
Rem. "Which ye now see" (chapter 2:33, Authorised Version).
C.A.C. Yes, there was evidence. Nothing is more noticeable than the fact that the presence of the Spirit was a thing that was manifested. There was no question in those days as to who had the Spirit and who had not, but it is a very important question in these days.
Ques. Is the power of the Holy Spirit available to be known today?
{307}
C.A.C. Yes; God says that His Spirit remains among you. This is a day of weakness and smallness but there is the abiding presence of the Spirit. It is remarkable that the evidence of the Spirit was largely in the way people spoke.
Ques. Should that be marked today?
C.A.C. One great advantage is that the power of the Spirit cannot be imitated.
Ques. Would it be a help to any soul to take account of where the activities of the Spirit are? Is it possible to trace them in a day like this?
C.A.C. I should think so. That is what we should all look for -- the evidence of the presence of the Spirit. This is a notable prayer in chapter 4; it is the only assembly prayer on record. The place was shaken following on the prayer. Apparently it was not a long prayer or a long meeting either. There was a state there that knew how to count on God in absolute power as Creator. We forget to pray to the Creator very often.
Ques. Would you do it in the assembly?
C.A.C. Certainly; this was in the assembly and is the only assembly prayer we have in Scripture.
Rem. We are accustomed to connect the blessing at table with the Creator, but I fear we have overlooked it in the assembly.
C.A.C. The assembly is the spot where God gets His place as Creator. They address Him in this prayer by a remarkable word, as Despot, One who has despotic power (verse 24). His power is witnessed in creation; they had a sense of the immensity of the power in God. This prayer meeting seemed only to last two and a half minutes, and yet they had such a sense of the greatness of God that all that was hostile was as nothing! If we remembered that in our prayer meetings it would give a great lift to the occasion.
Ques. They were filled with the Spirit as a result; if there was more of this kind of prayer with us would there be more receptiveness to the Spirit?
{308}
C.A.C. Quite so. The question is, are we prepared to be filled with the Spirit? We are often not prepared and there is not sufficient sense of the *greatness* of God, the mighty power that is vested in God. Nothing can resist His will. Being filled with the Spirit implies that there was nothing to obstruct it.
Rem. The state of being filled with the Spirit is not continuous, is it? It was after prayer that they were filled.
C.A.C. It is presented in the Acts as a special state, but in Ephesians you get the exhortation to be filled with the Spirit, which suggests the possibility of it being continuous.
Rem. In the Acts it is presented from the divine side.
C.A.C. I thought so. With us it raises a question whether we are prepared to be vessels filled with the Holy Spirit so that there is nothing of desire, motive or feeling except what has its origin in the Spirit. What a difference it would make to us! Think of the feelings that have place with us that are not of the Spirit! If we were filled with the Spirit nothing else would be in evidence. It has in view the testimony going forth so that it might be made manifest that God was there in the vessel. The shaking of the place was the outward evidence that God was there.
Ques. Would you connect that with God being in you of a truth?
C.A.C. It is the same kind of thing, God is there, and in @1 Corinthians 14 it is astonishing the number of references there are to speaking. I counted them once and the number astonished me. Here it says that they all were filled with the Holy Spirit and *spoke* the word of God. A great sign of the presence of the Spirit is the ability to speak. If one cannot speak there is no evidence of the presence of the Spirit of God. In the assembly you get speaking, and it is worth while to wait for that character of speaking. The fact that the Spirit came down as cloven tongues of fire shows how the Spirit is connected with the power to speak. We are able to speak of God and of His Christ in the right way. That is the most powerful evidence of the presence of the Spirit; it is more powerful than the working of a miracle.
{309}
Rem. Paul desired utterance to be given him.
C.A.C. Yes. Every Christian has something inside, but the divine thought is that what is inside is to come out. The way we speak is chief evidence now of the presence of the Spirit. I do not know that any other evidence is to be relied on. If a person showed me a miracle I would regard it with suspicion, for I should wonder if the power that wrought it came from above or below. But if a brother or a sister can speak of Christ and of the Father's love in power, that is indisputable evidence of the presence of the Spirit. One would like to have a power of speaking that is altogether different from the way men are taught to speak at college. A divine way of speaking is divine things said in a supernatural way. We should all covet to be supernatural, the trouble is that we are so much on the natural. If you bring in the Spirit you have got what is above the natural altogether. When the Lord spoke, every utterance was in the power of the Holy Spirit. You will find in the Lord's references to the Spirit that He speaks of the Spirit as the power of utterance. I cannot say that I know much about it but it is a thing I covet.
Rem. In John's first epistle it speaks of every spirit that confesses Jesus Christ come in flesh.
C.A.C. Yes. One would like to say a few words that brought into evidence the presence of the Spirit whether in public or private. It would be better to speak five words that showed the presence of the Spirit than a thousand words not in the Spirit. The presence of God in the assembly is a solemn reality when we think of @Acts 5. Ananias came in and laid the money down and did not say a word; it was a silent lie to the Holy Spirit. We may do the same thing. I remember a man asking me once, Was there any proof in Scripture that the Holy Spirit was God? I replied, Yes, and quoted @Acts 5: 4, "Thou hast not lied to men, but to God". The Spirit there was objectively present. The Spirit was there as a divine Person in @Acts 5, though He is not looked at exactly as indwelling the saints but as having His dwelling amongst
{310}
the saints. When we come to the meeting we come to the presence of God; that is a necessary thing to remember. When a man goes into a church he takes his hat off because he thinks it is the house of God. In the assembly God is there; the way we come in and the way we sit down and the way we behave should be reverential as realising that God is there.
Rem. There is a verse in the Psalms which says that God is to be feared in the assembly.
C.A.C. Neither Ananias nor Sapphira thought of that. We often do not think that God is in the assembly, and there may be something about us that has an element of falsehood and we bring it in to the assembly. It is a very exercising and solemn thing, so that holy fear was produced as the result of this solemn judgment. A sense of seriousness is produced of having to do with God *here*, not in heaven but God down here in the assembly.
Ques. Why is it called the Spirit of the Lord later on in chapter 5?
C.A.C. It is the Spirit of Jehovah; he is thinking of the Spirit as a divine Person as known in the Old Testament. We get the Spirit of Jehovah there, and I think it is the thought carried on. It is not so much the indwelling Spirit, it is important to distinguish between the indwelling Spirit and God being amongst His people assemblywise.
Ques. Is the indwelling Spirit peculiar to the present time and the other peculiar to Israel's time?
C.A.C. Yes. The Spirit retains both characters. He not only retains a subordinate place as indwelling the saints -- there are limitations connected with that -- but He retains His sovereign place in Deity. In the glory of His place in Deity He dwells among the saints; God dwells there Spiritwise.
Rem. It is important to distinguish the character in which God dwells.
C.A.C. Yes, and it is important to distinguish the greatness and holiness that belong to God; He is to be held in
{311}
reverence. If we lose a sense of reverence we shall lose the gain of the presence of the Spirit.
Rem. Expressions that are wanting in reverence are often wanting in guarding His deity.
C.A.C. He can only be addressed as Lord in the power of the Holy Spirit. I am afraid we are slack in regard of these things. We think we can kneel down and say 'Lord Jesus', without the Spirit, but we cannot. If I cannot say Lord Jesus by the Spirit, I do not address Him at all. It is easy to say, 'Lord Jesus', but to say it by the power of the Spirit is to link you with a living Person. It is better to wait half an hour on your knees than to miss it altogether. We need to be impressed with the greatness of these things. We may have known them all our lives but it is the Spirit who brings us into the reality of them.
In chapter 6 we see that even the poor cannot be cared for except in the power of the Spirit. It needed seven men full of the Spirit to carry on deacon service among the poor. What is needed is simplicity of heart that knows how to renounce what is of the flesh and nature and is therefore free to use the power of the Spirit.
We want to get to the reality of the Spirit, to exercise one another as to the spiritual reality of it.
Ques. Would you say a word as to chapter 5: 32, the Spirit being given to those who obey?
C.A.C. Two things are distinguished for us, the witness of the apostles and the witness of the Spirit; they are looked at as two distinguishable things. It says in chapter 15, "It has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us". What a wonderful statement that is!
Ques. In what way does being filled with the Spirit lead in the administration of natural things?
C.A.C. Nothing needs more wisdom than the care for temporal needs. Natural hardness or natural sympathy can easily come in. There had been defect here in @Acts 6 and these widows had been neglected. The thing was to remedy
{312}
the defect. If there is anything defective among us we want to get it right. All defects are remedied by bringing in the presence of the Spirit. It delivers us from natural hardness of heart or from natural kindness and generosity. Natural generosity is as objectionable to God as natural stinginess. We want to get rid of both elements so that there would be in giving neither too little nor too much. All these things show the practical effects of the presence of the Spirit, and the practical application is as necessary for us today as it was then. Any power in the gospel or ministry in the assembly must be in the power of the Spirit. We are in the midst of christendom which has set up all kinds of devices to be independent of the Spirit. That character of things is all around us, but we should desire to be in the midst of that as those seeking to be able to evidence the power of the Spirit; so that if anyone was wishing to know where to go we could say, "Come and see". All the vessels in which the Spirit dwells should be in liberty and able to speak in the power of the Holy Spirit. One would go a long way to see a little company where that was verified!
{313}
NOTES OF A READING
@Acts 5: 1 - 16
Ques. What would this teach us, following on what is set out in the chapter before, where we see unity perfectly expressed?
C.A.C. The early part of this chapter brings out in a very solemn way that God is present in His assembly. In the previous chapter God was known to be in His assembly by the fruits of grace and love and unity that came out in His people. The great thing to be noted is that God was there.
Rem. I suppose the danger of mere imitation comes out in view of that.
C.A.C. I thought so. The great outstanding fact that marks the assembly is that God is there; so that all that goes on in our meetings should be the evidence that God is amongst us.
Ques. Would the thought of lying to the Holy Spirit stand connected with that?
C.A.C. I thought it served to bring out that God was there. We should all think of the assembly as the place where God dwells. The youngest should think of it in that way. So that in coming to the meetings we have the thought of coming to the spot where God dwells.
Rem. The previous chapter would be the evidence that God was there.
C.A.C. There was never seen anything like it on earth before -- a company of thousands of people of whom not one said that anything he possessed was his own. There was the action of unselfish love; those who had possessions sold them and they distributed to all who had need; there was most blessed evidence that God was amongst His people. God's blessed nature was coming out. We who belong to the assembly of God have to consider this, that God's blessed character is to come out in us, it is to come out in me.
{314}
Rem. In the last verse of Ezekiel we read, "The name of the city from that day, Jehovah is there": evidently there will be evidence that God is there.
C.A.C. Yes; a most blessed side to that comes out in @Acts 4. There was power for service: they were all filled with the Holy Spirit; that is, they were filled with God. Those who served were filled with God. Now we cannot rightly entertain anything less than that. No one is entitled to take part in a meeting if he is not filled with God. That is the true conception of the assembly in function.
Rem. "And the heart and soul of the multitude of those that had believed were one" (chapter 4: 32).
C.A.C. Nothing could bring that about but the presence of God. Spiritual unity is the result of the presence of God; it will never be brought about in any other way.
Rem. And if that is maintained it is immovable: "God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved" (@Psalm 46: 5).
C.A.C. Quite so; and so for the last days we read, "The firm foundation of God stands" (@2 Timothy 2: 19). It is the foundation of God: that is the point. So that amidst all the shifting sand of these last days we have to look for the firm foundation of God. That is the source of stability in the last days.
The source of power, stability, peace and unity all lies in the presence of God; the meetings are good just in proportion as room is made for the presence of God, and as each one brings in some evidence of it. Of all these thousands of people every one brought in some evidence that God was there.
Ques. Is that the reason why there was such a quick exposure?
C.A.C. I thought so. Ananias and Sapphira do not seem to have had any part or lot in what was going on, but they wanted to have part in the reputation and honour: they were imitators. Outwardly they appeared to do the same as others were doing, but the others were filled with God, and Ananias was filled with Satan. Peter says, "Why has Satan filled thy
{315}
heart?" What a terrible thing to see that at a moment when many hearts were filled with God there was one amongst the believing company, whose heart was filled with Satan! It is very solemn!
Ques. In the previous chapter there are no reserves, are there?
C.A.C. Quite so.
Rem. Then there were conditions there to detect that; I suppose there are not always such conditions with us.
C.A.C. Perhaps not publicly, but God does not suffer any evil to pass unjudged.
Rem. Peter is in evidence in the detection of the thing.
C.A.C. Yes; there was special power present to discern what was going on, but God never passes over what is evil. He will always judge what is evil in His assembly.
Ques. And will bring it to light?
C.A.C. Well, if need be; it does not always please God to bring things to light; He often gives time for things to be judged in secret. I believe that many things that have to be publicly judged are matters that might have been privately judged. God gives space for repentance.
Rem. This was the outcome of an agreement.
C.A.C. Yes, that made it much worse; and I think we have to notice Peter's questions. He says in verse 3, "Ananias, why has Satan filled thy heart?" and in verse 4, "Why is it that thou hast purposed this thing in thine heart?"; and in verse 9 he says to the wife, "Why is it that ye have agreed together?" That is something to think about, because it suggests there was a reason for their action. This thing did not come about accidentally: Peter asks, Why is it?
Rem. It seems to indicate that there might have been a course leading to it.
C.A.C. It suggests that there had been a secret history behind this, and Peter directs their attention to it when he says. Why is it? And when there is anything wrong with us there is a reason for it. None of us falls into sin without there
{316}
being a reason for it, and the reason often is what it was with Ananias and Sapphira; that is, the heart is empty.
Rem. Your thought is that otherwise Satan could not have filled it.
C.A.C. That is what I thought. An empty heart is a workshop for the devil.
Rem. Like the spirit spoken of in the gospels which found the house empty, swept and garnished.
C.A.C. I was thinking of that scripture. An evil spirit has gone out of a man, but he wanders about and cannot find rest; so he says, "I will return to my house whence I came out; and having come, he finds it unoccupied, swept, and adorned" (@Matthew 12: 44). An empty house -- let us beware of that! Dear young people, see to it that your heart is not an empty house!
Rem. It says of Mary Magdalene, "From whom seven demons had gone out"; there was no room for them.
C.A.C. Yes, they went when Christ came in. You cannot have seven demons along with Christ.
Rem. So you suggest this is the contrast to verse 31 of the previous chapter, "They were all filled with the Holy Spirit".
C.A.C. Yes, that is fine. If you are filled, there is no room for anything else; that is the thought. We are commanded to be filled with the Spirit (@Ephesians 5: 18). If we are filled with the Spirit there is no room for workings of the flesh; there is no room for such things as came out in these two unhappy people. It was not that there was any lack of wonderful things to fill their heart. Wonderful things were present: Jesus had been made known as glorified in heaven, made Lord and Christ up there, and He had received the Holy Spirit and shed Him forth upon thousands of believers so that there was this great company of persons on earth filled with the Spirit. What wonderful things to fill anybody's heart! And yet these two poor creatures had empty hearts so that they were just ready for Satan to fill them.
Ques. Is that why the judgment was so severe?
{317}
C.A.C. I think it was a most extraordinary state of wickedness; it was a sin unto death. John tells us, "There is a sin to death", as much as to say to us that we are not to forget it; and this was a sin unto death.
Ques. Was the ability that Peter had to discern this state of things something sovereignly given to him as needed at the moment? When persons came, apparently giving the whole of the proceeds of the sale of land, it was quite supernatural to be able immediately to recognise that only part of the proceeds was being given. It is altogether outside the ability of the most acute of natural minds.
C.A.C. Quite so: I suppose it is an example of one of the gifts of the Spirit. One of the gifts is said to be the discerning of spirits. The Holy Spirit would give supernatural power to discern spirits. We have to bear that in mind. When an evil spirit was at work it would be discerned. God has furnished the assembly with ability to discern when an evil spirit is at work, and He has also given ability to discern when a sin is unto death; because John says, "There is a sin to death: I do not say of that that he should make a request" (@1 John 5: 16). There is a possibility of a sin of such a character that no spiritual person would pray for the one who committed it. That is very solemn. So Peter here does not pray for them. All this belongs to the very constitution of the assembly.
Rem. These various things allowed to happen at the beginning which were adverse in character only served to bring out what was there.
C.A.C. I thought so, and it is noticeable that the christian company is not spoken of as the assembly till the middle of this chapter. It is after this solemn judgment of evil thoughts; because it was a judgment of evil thoughts really.
Rem. It must be so, because, as you were saying, in the previous chapter there is the evidence of God being there: there had been nothing like it on earth before.
C.A.C. Satan had shown in the previous chapter that he could persecute and seek to crush the testimony; but now he
{318}
is taking another line of action and that is imitation. These two imitated what others were doing in the power of the Holy Spirit in pure unselfish love; they did the same thing, but self-interest was the only thing that governed them.
Rem. They wanted to get a name, and I suppose the spirit of emulation and rivalry came in.
C.A.C. Yes; we have to beware that we do not seek to have more honour in the assembly than we deserve. The Lord will see to it that we get all the honour we deserve either now or in that day; but if we want more honour than we deserve among the brethren we shall fall into the hands of Satan.
Rem. Like Diotrephes who wanted to have the first place among them.
C.A.C. Yes.
Ques. Would you say this is anything like the character of the sin committed by the Jews when they attributed the actions of the Lord to Beelzebub?
C.A.C. That was a terribly solemn thing to do because the works were the evidence that God was with Him; but in the wickedness of their hearts they said that He cast out demons by Beelzebub. It was not that they thought so, but they were wicked enough to say it although at bottom they did not think it.
Rem. There was an answer in @Acts 4 to what God desired in the law, that man should love God and his neighbour; and Ananias and Sapphira would give the appearance of doing it.
C.A.C. Yes; they wanted to pass off as quite as good as Barnabas who sold his estate and brought the money to the apostles. Outwardly they did the same thing but their inward motive was altogether different.
Ques. Would you say it was a right act with a wrong motive?
C.A.C. They were thinking of self: they wished to have the reputation among the brethren of being as devoted as anybody else; and at the same time they wanted to keep
{319}
something back. It was imitation.
Rem. This is an agreement on the part of two persons.
C.A.C. That is a dreadful thing. Jacob said, "Simeon and Levi are brethren", but he prays that he may not come into their council or be joined with their assembly (@Genesis 49: 6). If two people agree in evil, it is like the devil's counterpart to God's assembly where people are agreed in good.
Rem. It is striking that this is God's judgment, not Peter's; he spoke the truth in regard to them but God judged them, and they fell down and expired. That was not Peter's doing.
C.A.C. No, God was there.
Ques. Is there the ability to deal with matters like this today? Because it was the apostle Peter there.
C.A.C. In our case we have to judge things by testimony. The great principle is set up of judging things by testimony, so that the principle of two or three witnesses enters into every matter that we have to judge publicly. If we discerned that there was an evil spirit at work in a person we could not judge it merely because we discerned it; we have to wait until some evidence of it comes to light which can be the subject of testimony.
Rem. Jehovah of old said, "I Jehovah search the heart" (@Jeremiah 17: 10), and the heart-searching is going on.
C.A.C. Yes, what is brought out here is that God is in His assembly and that God will not allow evil to pass unjudged; and when evil takes a particularly glaring form it becomes a sin unto death, as it was here.
Ques. Would you say that Ananias and Sapphira had been spoken to by God previous to this?
C.A.C. They had been spoken to by what was going on amongst the brethren, this beautiful unselfish spirit of love that was in activity among the brethren; and though with them there was nothing but selfishness working in an empty heart, they tried to imitate the conduct of those whose hearts were filled with God, and so they fell into the hands of Satan.
{320}
Satan saw what was working with them, and he came in and filled their hearts and led them into this dreadful sin of lying to the Holy Spirit.
Ques. The fact that Satan is said to have filled the heart of Ananias does not take away from his responsibility, because Peter said, "Why is it that thou hast purposed this thing in thine heart?" The two things can be thought of as working together; Ananias is held fully responsible for what he did, although it is looked upon as the fruit of Satan filling his heart. How do you put those two things together?
C.A.C. There was a condition there that Satan could work upon. There was a purpose in his heart first, and Satan took advantage of this deliberate purpose. It was a thought-out scheme: they had talked it over, and agreed together to work the thing this way. Then Satan comes in and fills Ananias¬ heart so that he is not afraid to lie to the Holy Spirit. I think it was Satan who prompted him to that.
Ques. Was not the case of Judas somewhat similar? Satan put it into his heart to betray the Lord and then entered into him and took possession.
C.A.C. That is it. There was a purpose, and evil becomes very serious when it is the outcome of purpose. Evil is very deliberate when it becomes a subject of taking counsel together. That is evil in an organised and systematised form, and God judges it.
Rem. It is quite different from an ordinary slip, so to speak.
C.A.C. Quite so; this is presented to us as illustrating evil in the assembly in the most solemn light possible.
Ques. Do you think Achan's case was a slip?
C.A.C. No, I do not think so; I think it was very much like the sin of Ananias. He saw a goodly Babylonish garment. That was what Ananias and Sapphira wanted; they wanted to be adorned in the estimation of the brethren with a reputation for devotion; and then there was the silver and gold -- what appeals to man's selfishness. I think this sin corresponds very much to that of Achan.
{321}
Ques. Do you not think there is a great danger of our desiring a spiritual reputation we are not equal to? Is that not a very serious thing?
C.A.C. I think it is. I may speak and pray and take part in a meeting as wishing to give the impression that I am more spiritual than I am. We ought all of us to shrink from anything like that, from trying to appear of greater spiritual stature than we are. It is much better to be simple, because nothing really goes to God but what is real. The devil is always working to make us more or less counterfeit. Satan does not like us to be genuine. We should be concerned to be genuine right down to the roots and not to allow the smallest trace of anything that is not genuine.
Rem. "Pride goeth before destruction", whether spiritual or otherwise.
C.A.C. Quite so, and of course, if there is anything artificial it hinders the presence of God from being enjoyed. As we all know, in @1 Corinthians 14 when the assembly comes together for edification, what goes on is to be the evidence that God is there. It is not to be man's ability or knowledge or gift that is in evidence, but the presence of God. The unbeliever or simple person who comes in does not go away saying, They have some fine speakers there! He falls on his face and says, "God is indeed amongst you". That is what is to be in evidence in all our meetings, and if that were secured my impression is that if anyone like Ananias or Sapphira were there, they would want to get out. They would not want to stop there.
Rem. They would not be able to stand the light.
Rem. We cannot deceive the Lord as to our stature; it is impossible. The Lord knows every thought of our heart. He knows whether I am jealous of another brother, and would raise exercise with us as together.
C.A.C. And do you not think our happiness largely depends on spiritual reality? The moment you come down to your true level you find an increase of happiness, because you are now on ground where God can help you.
{322}
Rem. If you get out of your depth you easily drown; it says in relation to passing through the Red Sea, "of which the Egyptians having made trial were swallowed up" (@Hebrews 11: 29).
C.A.C. There is great instruction in all this; it would not be put into the scriptures if it were not of great value to us.
Rem. There is a side which is very encouraging in connection with it: in spite of a jealous God being there, the work of God proceeds.
C.A.C. Yes, and those who were real did not shrink from this manifestation of His presence. It says, "Of the rest durst no man join them" -- a very good thing, too!
Rem. Undoubtedly Peter had been with the Lord and had learned things. It says that the young men carried Ananias out.
C.A.C. It shows that there were those standing by who were available even for the most solemn service. We have sometimes to deal with matters we would naturally far rather leave alone; sometimes we have to be ready to carry out service of the most solemn nature and the young men were ready for this service, dreadfully solemn as it was.
Rem. It looks as though this occurrence stopped a course among the people: "Of the rest durst no man join them", as though others were coming along on the same lines.
C.A.C. That is important; but such an occurrence would not stop people getting converted and coming among them.
Rem. The "great fear" would be proper to the occasion.
C.A.C. Yes. It is remarkable that the assembly should be first formally spoken of in that character -- as a place of great fear. It says in the Psalms, "God is greatly to be feared in the council of the saints" (@Psalm 89: 7).
Rem. "Our God is a consuming fire" (@Hebrews 12:29).
Rem. John says to the young men: "I write to you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one" (@1 John 2: 13). I wondered if the young men would come in in that way.
{323}
C.A.C. Yes, it supposes there is energy in the assembly to deal with solemn matters. In the assembly it is not all a matter of privilege and blessing. At times the divine judgments have to be recorded in the assembly, and there should be spiritual energy to go through with even such solemn matters.
Rem. After the matter was concluded there was great movement, as if the good hand of God was free again.
C.A.C. It is very encouraging to see that when evil within was judged there was a wonderful revival outside and people were blessed in all directions.
Ques. Have you any thought as to why it was Solomon's porch (verse 12)?
C.A.C. It was where the Lord walked (@John 10: 23).
Ques. Would this in a way be like @1 Corinthians 11: 30, "On this account many among you are weak and infirm, and a good many are fallen asleep"?
C.A.C. Yes, it was the same thing. There was such disorder at Corinth that it was a sin unto death and "many" had died, not a natural death, but under the judgment of the Lord.
Ques. Would the thought of no man daring to join himself to them be over against what the Lord had done previously? It says in @Acts 2: 47, "The Lord added ... daily" -- it was not a matter of one joining himself.
C.A.C. Quite so; and there is a check put on that: they dared not do it.
Rem. It says, "They were all with one accord in Solomon's porch". It looks as if a state was brought about with them through the judgment.
C.A.C. Yes.
Rem. It makes one think of the fact that while Solomon was a great man of peace, he was a man of judgment. At the beginning of his career he shone as a man of judgment and discernment.
C.A.C. Yes, and it is said expressly that he made the
{324}
porch of judgment (@1 Kings 7: 7); and we ought to think of the assembly as the porch of judgment where things are judged. It is one important aspect of the assembly; and it is the condemnation of things today that in the religious world things are not judged. All kinds of evil are tolerated, covered up and allowed to pass; and that is why the Lord has had to withdraw Himself from the great religious bodies round about us: there is no ability to judge evil.
Ques. Would that account for the lack of ministry with them?
C.A.C. I think it would. One main thing that brought J.N.D. out from the Church of England was that he saw there was no power there to judge evil; and at the present time there is very little power to judge evil in the religious world. But as the truth of the assembly of God is restored to us the power to discern and judge what is evil will be found along with it. The apostle says, "Do not ye judge them that are within? But those without God judges" (@1 Corinthians 5: 12, 13). We have nothing to do with judging people in the world. God will judge them; but if there is evil in the assembly it must be judged by the saints, or otherwise they cease really and morally to be God's assembly. If evil is allowed to pass it is certainly not God's assembly.
Rem. That reference to the porch of judgment rather answers the question raised as to why they met in Solomon's porch after this occurrence. They met there under a sense of judgment.
C.A.C. Yes, it is most important. The idea of cherubim gives us that thought. There were cherubim in the temple and also in the tabernacle. It supposes judicial power.
Rem. I was thinking of the two pillars Jachin and Boaz, meaning "He will establish" and "In him is strength", standing as a testimony.
C.A.C. Yes, that is the testimony.
Ques. Might we have a word on the shadow of Peter?
C.A.C. The Lord had committed Himself in a wonderful way to Peter, using him to discern the evil and then making
{325}
such use of him that even his shadow would heal people. It is like the "greater works". The Lord spoke to His disciples of their doing the works He did, and greater works. We do not know that the shadow of the Lord ever healed anybody, but now He had gone to the Father and His power was great in His servant.
Ques. Does this wonderful way of blessing stand out in contrast to what had gone before? When the discipline of God had its way we see the blessing of God continuing, and through the same servant.
C.A.C. Yes. I believe when evil is judged in the assembly it always leads to an accession of power. Sometimes we shrink from dealing with evil because we are afraid as to what the results will be, fearing that things will be broken up and so on; but it does not work like that; it works the other way. When evil is judged it clears the way for the blessed actings of divine power and grace.
Ques. Is that why Levi comes into such blessing: he did not hesitate to execute judgment?
C.A.C. I thought so.
Ques. Is it not a very happy condition when healing is found in the assembly?
C.A.C. Yes; that is the normal state of things. The judgment of evil is abnormal, though necessary. We should not like to be always occupied in judging evil.
Rem. Peter would be quite unconscious of his shadow falling upon one and another. It shows how blessing can fall without our having any consciousness of it ourselves.
C.A.C. Yes.
Ques. Is there anything in regard of that which might be seen if we were what we were? It says the shadow of Peter fell upon people.
C.A.C. Yes, there was some substance there to cast a shadow. If there were no substance there would be no shadow.
Ques. Would that suggest an influence today?
C.A.C. I thought so -- the influence of reality, of what is
{326}
genuine. We do not need to be concerned about being big or important, but do let us all be concerned to be real, to be genuine. If we are genuine there is something substantial there that will cast a healing shadow on other people.
Rem. The shadow comes because we are in the light.
Rem. The conscience is clear.
C.A.C. Yes, and there is the virtue of positive good.
Rem. We shall be set in the local meeting for healing.
C.A.C. Yes, there is always a healing influence going out from a spiritual man or woman. There is an influence that tends to healing and we must not forget that, because that is the normal state of things: what is not in health is not to be crushed but to be healed. In the assembly there may be those who need healing, so there should be a healing influence.
Rem. Elisha carried that with him.
C.A.C. Yes, he did.
Rem. I suppose it is the public testimony that is in question in these verses 11 - 16.
C.A.C. Yes, quite so.
Rem. It is not so much the internal working of the assembly, but their influence in the way of testimony as amongst men.
C.A.C. I thought so. The testimony now is that God is dwelling amongst men in blessing. People sometimes ask what the testimony is: that is the testimony.
Rem. In chapter 4 we read that the apostles gave witness with great power to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, but now you have increase of testimony.
C.A.C. Yes.
Ques. We are reminded of the words in @Hebrews 2: 4. Speaking of those who continued the testimony after the Lord's ascension it says, "God bearing, besides, witness with them to it, both by signs and wonders, and various acts of power, and distributions of the Holy Spirit, according to his will". This would be an example of that, would it not?
C.A.C. Yes. What we want in each local assembly is those conditions that are the evidence of the presence of
{327}
God, so that people come to the meetings and get blessing. That is the normal state of things.
Rem. It all leads on from one thing to another. At the end of chapter 4 we see a beautiful state of things within, the complete unity that was referred to; then in chapter 5 we see the power to detect and to judge evil when it comes in from without; and then the moving out in testimony so that men generally get the benefit of God's presence in His house.
C.A.C. It is very beautiful. We ought to take it to heart that God is dwelling amongst His people with a view to the blessing of all men; so that the testimony does not exactly concern God in heaven, but God dwelling down here amongst His people so that He may be known as a God of blessing, One who is pleased to dwell with men.
{328}
NOTES OF A READING
@Acts 11: 1 - 18
Ques. What is the import of the great sheet?
C.A.C. It sets forth what God is doing at the present time, cleansing all sorts of unclean persons.
Rem. Peter sees them in the sheet.
C.A.C. There is a wonderful movement going on now which has its origin in heaven and its destiny in heaven. None will go into heaven but who are in the vessel.
Rem. I suppose Peter had a very limited idea of the gospel.
C.A.C. He needed to be brought into the present mind of heaven. He was no doubt aware that the grace of God would go out to the gentile world from such scriptures as @Isaiah 66: 18 - 21, and also that the Jews, the Israelites, would be brought to Jerusalem "as an oblation ..., as the children of Israel bring an oblation in a clean vessel into the house of Jehovah". This was another kind of vessel, "a certain vessel descending like a great sheet", coming from and going back to heaven. Peter had never heard of that before nor could he be expected to.
Rem. And it is universal, "letdown by four corners".
C.A.C. A vessel "like a great sheet". No one who knows God would think that He would be satisfied with anything small. In @Acts 2: 11 they hear "the great things of God", and in @Luke 14: 16 - 23 He makes "a great supper" and "many" are invited and the house is to be "filled". There are many creatures of all kinds in the vessel but they are all cleansed. There is nothing common or unclean in that vessel. It is a serious question whether we are in the vessel or not.
Rem. God had effected the cleansing.
C.A.C. God is very active in the cleansing of those who have been common or unclean. Nothing that is common
{329}
would do for God. "Nothing common ... shall at all enter into" the holy city (@Revelation 21: 27).
Rem. "But ye have been washed, but ye have been sanctified, but ye have been justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God" (@1 Corinthians 6: 11). They are dignified.
C.A.C. There are ten very unclean animals there: fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, those who make women of themselves, who abuse themselves with men, thieves, covetous, drunkards, abusive persons, rapacious (verses 9 and 10). And the apostle goes on to say, "And these things were some of you; but ye have been washed" etc. They had been unclean, but they had been washed and now had their places in this vessel.
Ques. As to "no difference", were all such once?
C.A.C. There is a difference, but all are unclean. There are four things: quadrupeds, four-footed beasts, which might be useful, such as the horse for instance; wild beasts, such as you would be afraid of; creeping things, grovelling in the dirt; birds of the air, having high notions.
But if all are unclean and shut out from God's presence, there is not much difference. Some men are "wild beasts", some are "loathsome", whilst some are respectable, but all are unclean and all must be cleansed by God. None have any place in this vessel but those whom God has cleansed. And there are millions in it now.
Ques. How did they get in?
C.A.C. They get in by the operation of God.
Rem. One by one. "It came even tome".
C.A.C. The reality of it comes home to each soul. Each of us has to do with God. We come in as Cornelius did. Cornelius began to pray; it does not say when he began, perhaps when he was a boy.
Ques. Was he born again then?
C.A.C. He was seeking God and His blessing. Look at @Acts 9, Ananias practically says of Saul, 'I dare not go to
{330}
him. He is a wild beast. He has been devouring the saints'. But what does the Lords say? "Behold, he is praying"! He is in the vessel, he is cleansed.
Rem. Like the tax-gatherer, "O God, have compassion on me, the sinner" (@Luke 18: 13).
C.A.C. Yes, and every one who really desires to have blessing from God, having an exercised conscience and fearing God.
Rem. And such are not only in the vessel, but will go up with it.
C.A.C. There is a movement from heaven when any sinner repents, from the creation of the world till now. God moves from heaven. That is why they are so happy in heaven "for one repenting sinner", because they know it came from heaven (@Luke 15: 7, 10). God has cleansed him. When anyone has owned that he is all wrong and desires blessing from God, then he is cleansed and in the vessel.
Ques. Why does it say it was "let down by four corners"?
C.A.C. God would teach Peter that He was going to work in all four corners of the earth, that He was not limited to the Jew or to Israel, and that He was going to cleanse all those He worked in and make them ready to hear the good news that He has to send to them about Christ.
Rem. Made ready for it by the work of God. "Now therefore *we* are all present before God to hear all things that are commanded thee of God" (@Acts 10: 33).
C.A.C. If God did not prepare souls for the gospel it would not be much good preaching it to them, but He does, and all is certain and secure; they are secured for heaven as having a place in that vessel.
Rem. Outside of it there is no security.
C.A.C. It should be a great exercise to all men to make sure and to be concerned as to having a place in that vessel. The Lord says to Paul in Corinth, "I have much people in this city" (@Acts 18: 10). These were the very people of
{331}
@1 Corinthians 6. God would secure from those unclean people something for Himself. He is visiting the nations to take out of them a people for His name. He is invoking His name among the Gentiles, "on whom my name is invoked, saith the Lord, who does these things known from eternity" (@Acts 15: 17, 18).
Rem. They are taken out and put in this one vessel.
C.A.C. They are taken out to be for God and for heaven at the present time.
Ques. Is it "one flock" now?
C.A.C. They all become sheep, clean animals, cleansed by God.
Rem. There is preparation in that way for the gospel.
C.A.C. A work of God. The Lord says in @John 10: 16, "And I have other sheep which are not of this fold: those also I must bring". He brings them by giving them exercises and convictions. God's cleansing work may begin very early in life. You are cleansed in your thoughts and are sorry about your sins and do not run greedily after the lusts of the world. We must not think that God does not work in a little child. It is the fruit of movement from heaven when anyone really says before God, 'I have sinned'. We look out for such, whom God has washed and cleansed. However bad a man may have been, God can wash him.
Rem. It has been said that the same word is used in the original in "the Holy Spirit fell upon them" (verse 15) and in "his father ... fell upon his neck" (@Luke 15: 20).
C.A.C. Yes, it is God's embrace. But before that they received these wonderful "words". "Peter, who shall speak words to thee whereby thou shalt be saved, thou and all thy house" (verse 14). We are saved by words. Those words all speak of God's actings in Christ. He sent the word to the sons of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ, who went about doing good and healing all oppressed of the devil, because God was with Him; and He is now Lord of all (@Acts 10: 3638). And the wonderful testimony was "that every one that
{332}
believes on him will receive through his name remission of sins" (verse 43). These are very precious words. We hear what God has done in Christ. Everybody who receives these words is saved by the words. As Paul says to the Corinthians in @1 Corinthians 15: 1 - 6 in regard of what he had delivered to them "according to the scriptures", "the glad tidings which I announced to you, ... by which also ye are saved, (if ye hold fast the word which I announced to you as the glad tidings)". God has put wonderful power into words because they are words that tell me about Christ. It is the light of God's salvation in Christ, true on the part of God and of Christ. When I believe it I am saved by believing, freed from all the dark and deluding influences of the world and from myself, and by faith directed to God and to Christ. If I receive the words, I am saved by them. The Holy Spirit falls on saved people and cleansed people. Saved people have the light of God's salvation in Christ.
Rem. The cleansing is of God and the gospel is of God.
C.A.C. The words speak of Christ. "To him all the prophets bear witness that every one that believes on him will receive through his name remission of sins". Those are the words. And they are just as true this minute as when Peter said them. These Gentiles were *cleansed*. Cornelius had prayed and he was one who feared God and wrought righteousness; that is, he sought to do what was right. They were *saved*: their hearts were purified (@Acts 15: 7 - 9) and the heart-knowing God bore witness to them in giving them the Spirit. We do not know each other's hearts, but God knows whether our hearts are really purified or not, whether we have repented and turned to Him and received Christ and our hearts have been purified from all the vain things in the world. I am sorry to say that I used to go to what are called 'innocent entertainments' and on one occasion I paid for my ticket to go in, but while waiting for the entertainment to begin I thought to myself, 'This is no place for me', and I got up and went out. I never regret losing that money!
{333}
You find you cannot go on with foolish and sinful things. Why? Because God has come into your view in Christ to purify you from all uncleanness and put you into the vessel. God sees where there is a heart purified. My heart once ran after the things in the world, ran greedily, but a time came when I could not because my heart was purified. The Holy Spirit is God's witness to a purified heart. God loves to give the Spirit to a purified heart. God's wonderful words concerning Himself and Christ are received, the heart is purified (the link with the world broken) and then you get the gift of the Spirit, which is God's embrace. The prodigal, coming to himself, said, "I will rise up and go to my father, and I will say to him, Father, I have sinned". The father saw him while he was yet a long way off, and he ran and fell on his neck and covered him with kisses. God throws His arms around the one who repents. "Yea, he loveth the peoples" (@Deuteronomy 33: 3). That word "loveth" means "to lie in the bosom". God takes the prodigal and he is enfolded into the bosom of God. What a God we have to deal with!
Rem. We heard of a case where a servant of the Lord was reading @Luke 15 to a lady who was very ill. When he came to verses 14 - 16 he heard her whisper. 'That's me'. He went on reading and when he had read verse 20 he said, 'And that's God'. God is waiting to hear "I have sinned".
C.A.C. I doubt whether there is one here in whom God has not worked from heaven. Perhaps we have never let it out. I would not have let anyone know of my exercises at the time for anything -- that is Satan's power. But what God works from heaven goes back to heaven. I never gave up praying every day that I might be saved 'sometime'. Those were movements of desire that were wrought from heaven. By and by the movements of heaven triumphed. There are the 'four ropes' going back to God's immutable counsel. God gets the victory. The movements of heaven leading souls to repentance have their result, and by and by all goes back to heaven.
{334}
PROPHETIC COMMUNICATIONS
@Acts 11: 5 - 7; @Acts 22: 17, 18, 21; @Revelation 1: 9, 10
One is thankful to be reminded, as we have been, of the importance of prophetic communications, for they are, I think we might say, communications of the mind of heaven at any particular moment. Nothing is more to be desired than to be recipients of communications that give us the present mind of heaven, and as being of the assembly we are in a position and in relationships which make it a delight to God to communicate His mind to us.
I ventured to read these three scriptures because Peter and Paul and John were men who were of great interest to heaven, and the Lord did not leave them without the communication of His mind. In each case they received communications: the first two of them receiving things relative to the beginning of things in the assembly period and John receiving what refers specially to the close of that period, which brings the experience of John in a definite way to our own time and to ourselves.
What I have specially in mind relates to what our brother referred to as the capacity to receive. We may be assured that heaven is ready to communicate; that is, divine Persons are ready to communicate; but the more special and exalted the communications are the more special is the condition of soul that is required to receive them. I feel as to meetings of this character (I may say this is the first of such a character at which I have been privileged to be present) that spiritual capacity to communicate will be found perhaps in two or three, but it is of immense importance that spiritual capacity to receive shall be found in all, otherwise these meetings will fail of the divine intent.
You will notice that in each case these great servants of God speak of special communications, but at the same time they call attention to special conditions on their part which
{335}
qualified them to receive divine communications. Peter speaks of it very simply to the brethren; he says, "I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in an ecstasy I saw a vision". Paul tells the crowd at Jerusalem that as he was praying -- notice again, as he was praying -- he became in ecstasy. And John, who is the vessel of the divine communications and prophetic word of the last days, uses corresponding language; he says that he "became in the Spirit on the Lord's day".
These statements are not to be regarded lightly, because I cannot suppose that ecstasy is limited in the divine mind to the apostles, nor that being, as John says, "in the Spirit" is restricted. What I understand by it is that, if we are to be spiritually capable of receiving communications from heaven, there must be a state and abstraction of mind which would somewhat correspond with what is referred to in Scripture as "ecstasy". I do not mean to suggest anything mystical or fanciful, but a sober spiritual reality; and we may notice, as helpful to us in this regard, that the prayers of Peter and of Paul tended to ecstasy. It is a fine suggestion for us, beloved brethren. It was private prayer, whether on the housetop or in the temple, but the prayers of these two great servants led to ecstasy.
I take it that ecstasy is a condition in which the mind is abstracted from the natural and human influences that would normally act upon our minds and our spirits. Ecstasy implies complete freedom from all that and indicates a state which makes room for the reception of the mind of heaven. I am sure we are all convinced that such a state is extremely desirable, indeed it is essential if we are to have prophetic communications in the assembly. Such communications are of such an exalted character that they require entire immunity from the influence of the conditions that normally act upon us here. It is encouraging to note that private prayer on the part of Peter and Paul tended to that condition; so that the importance of prayer in relation to such meetings as this is very great. We should come to them from intercourse with
{336}
God and with our minds free in a special way. There are special things and states in christianity as well as what is, I may say, ordinary in a spiritual sense; and we should cultivate that special condition of soul that is peculiarly free to receive divine communications. Paul, as we know, speaks in another scripture of being beside himself to God. One covets the realisation of such a state as that; it is very much the thought of "ecstasy"; the soul is free from self-consideration and thus prepared for the communication of God's mind.
With Peter and Paul it was the communication of the mind of heaven at the beginning; the Gentile was coming into view. The Gentile was being revealed as in the light of God's purposes, cleansed and fitted for a place in the spiritual house concerning which Peter afterwards ministered. They were to take up the holy service of God. It was a wonderful flood of heavenly light into the soul of Peter. Then, in relation to Paul the word of God was to be completed, the whole counsel of God was coming out, the full height of all that was in God's mind -- the truth of the mystery, the assembly as the body of Christ and as the habitation of God in the Spirit. It was all coming out, but the intimation of it came to a man in ecstasy. I cannot but think that God greatly values a condition of soul which is free from the normal influences that act upon us as living in this world. He would have us free so that we might come into the mind of heaven as receiving communications that come to us from God.
John's experience brings us to our own time, because, as we know, the Revelation of Jesus Christ refers to the end of the church period and to that which will follow. John tells us in chapter 1 that the things "must shortly take place" and "the time is near", so that the Revelation is to be read as specifically applying to the very time in which we find ourselves now. Here is a blessed servant of God suffering for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus, and that is the moral qualification to receive further light. I believe that at the present time those who have received light from God are
{337}
those who have been prepared to suffer for what they already know. I believe if any Christian is prepared to suffer for what he knows he will get communications from heaven. They come to people who value the things of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ so far as they may have understood it, and who are prepared to suffer for it. Such persons do not find it difficult to become "in the Spirit". John says, "I became in the Spirit". He is not referring to the christian state as described in @Romans 8 but to something special. I believe, dear brethren, we ought to lay ourselves out for what is special.
As being "in the Spirit" John gets wonderful communications; and those communications, so far as they relate to our period, relate to local assemblies, bringing out the special interest of the Lord in local assemblies. Chapter 1 and chapter 22, the beginning and the end of this book, make clear that the Lord has before Him the thought of local assemblies. It is not the truth in a general way, or abstractly, but it is the thought of the truth of the assembly as worked out in a concrete way in localities. I think we must accept that; and I take it, beloved brethren, that what is prophetic in any local company or companies must of necessity have a bearing on the local conditions of that company. The Lord is specially testifying things in the assemblies. "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies" (chapter 22: 16).
The Lord is contemplating that the church period shall end in character as it began. He tells us He is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. The end is to correspond with the beginning; that is the idea. We have been already reminded that the mind of God does not change. What was in the mind of God in the beginning, communicated through Peter to the Jews and through Paul towards the Gentiles, still remains true. Paul set the local assemblies in the light of the precious ministry which was committed to him; he set all the local assemblies in the light of the kingdom of God, and the
{338}
house of God and the body of Christ. That was his ministry, and he set the assemblies in that light at the beginning. It is to be noticed, too, that Peter addresses in his epistle the sojourners of the dispersion in the same area geographically as the seven assemblies of @Revelation 1. The truth of a spiritual house and a holy priesthood was to take form in the five provinces named. He clearly had local companies in view as found in a large area.
I believe we have very little idea of the importance to divine Persons of our coming together (no matter how few or how feebly outwardly) in the light and faith of the original and unchanging mind of God with regard to His people. As we come together thus, the prophetic word will confirm every exercise that is of God. I would say in this connection that ecstasy does not set aside personal exercise. We find in the case of Peter and Paul that personal exercise came into expression even when in ecstasy. We find these two great servants (just like the brethren of today) not at once prepared to receive divine communications. They both reasoned against the divine communications and entered good arguments against them. So you see the element of personal exercise goes on; but if we are really in a state which at all corresponds with ecstasy we shall not find it difficult to judge any action of our own minds and our own wills. These great servants were not disobedient to the heavenly visions; they accepted the light.
As we walk together in local assemblies we find that exercises come along and they test and humble us. The effect of divine communications in a day of departure must always be humbling. They will always have the effect they had upon John; when he saw one like the Son of man he fell at His feet as dead. If we have prophetic ministry, do not let us think we are going to enjoy it. Prophetic ministry is not a thing to be enjoyed; it comes to search us, to go down to the very roots of our moral being to find out our motives and feelings and thoughts; but if we are in the Spirit we shall accept adjustment.
{339}
One great mark of a person who has known what it is to withdraw into this peculiar abstraction of mind involved in being in the Spirit is that he, is amenable to adjustment; the mind of heaven carries his conscience and his affections.
My thought was to add a word in connection with what had already been said, as to the spiritual condition that would give us capacity to receive communications of the mind of heaven. It is an extraordinary moment, because one cannot think that the Lord will leave any part of the truth altogether ineffective before He translates the assembly to Himself. He will make every part of the truth effective, and He will make it effective in local companies; so that this has a very practical bearing on us as walking together in local fellowship. The Lord will help us as to His mind, even though we may have to fall at His feet as dead: I feel sure I am speaking to many who, like myself, have had to taste in some small measure an experience like that. But we have always found, and shall find, that the one who searches is the One who supports, and He teaches us that we can only follow righteousness, faith, love, peace, as calling upon Him out of a pure heart; that is, He alone is our resource and strength. If He gives us the mind of heaven it will search and expose a great deal that has been in ourselves, but He will make Himself adequate and sufficient for us, so that in the very last moment of the church's history there may be something very bright for Himself.
John gives the church a glorious finish -- "The Spirit and the bride say, Come". That will mark the local assemblies when the prophetic word has done its work. I take it that the Spirit and the bride being free to say 'Come' means that everything has been judged that came under the displeasure of heaven; the washing of the robes has been completed and there has been a going in to eat of the Tree-of Life in moral conditions that are suitable. The assembly's finish thus becomes similar to the assembly's beginning. I do not say in a large way publicly, but I believe God intends to realise these
{340}
things in a remnant. Perhaps in a very small remnant, but the size of the thing is not important with God. What is important is that His thought shall be secured in spiritual reality, and all that He is doing now is to this end.
{341}
NOTES OF A READING
@Acts-11: 19 - 30
C.A.C. We cannot do better than read this portion. We do not want to leave out the other vessel, do we?
Ques. What is that?
C.A.C. Well, there must be a place for those who are cleansed. We were looking at the vessel last Lord's Day which Peter saw come down from heaven with all manner of creatures in it, once unclean but now cleansed by God. The cleansing comes from heaven and the vessel is drawn up again to heaven to show that all the creatures that are cleansed are going back there. It is a broad and universal outlook on what God is doing at the present time. There are vast numbers of persons in that vessel. Where are they going to find their place in the meantime? Is there no place of protection, security and blessing on earth? The end of the chapter gives us the vessel down here.
Ques. In @Matthew 13: 48 "they gathered the good into vessels". Would that intimate a place for them here before they go to heaven?
C.A.C. There are vessels here for them to be put into. The first assembly in the gentile world was at Antioch. Antioch is a pattern assembly, a vessel where believers in the Lord find their place. It is wonderful to see that God in His sovereign power is cleansing all sorts of creatures. "What God has cleansed, do not thou make common". There are a vast number of people whom God has cleansed that they might appreciate the gospel and value "words" whereby they will be saved and receive remission of sins and the gift of the Holy Spirit. They have the Spirit eventually and thus are suitable to go to heaven. The Spirit came down from heaven and those who have the Spirit are suitable to go to heaven. The sheet is drawn up again. But the question is, is there any provision made for us down here? The vessel that Peter saw is
{342}
not exactly visible. He was "in an ecstasy" to see it and "saw a vision" and it is thus as to what God is doing at the present time.
Ques. Cornelius is a pattern, is he not, of one in that vessel?
C.A.C. Yes, he was unclean once but now cleansed; he is praying and doing things acceptable to God. He is interested in the gospel, delighted to hear "words" and accepted the message at once and received the remission of sins to which God bore witness in giving him the Holy Spirit.
Ques. The gift of the Spirit is a necessity in view of the assembly, would you say?
C.A.C. As having the Spirit, we get a wonderful sense of the lordship of Christ. The local assembly is formed in that way. Every person who comes under the lordship of Christ will find his or her place in the local assembly. Everything now turns on their knowing the Lord, not now God as in connection with the other vessel, where it is God cleansing, God sending, God anointing, God raising up, God giving testimony (chapter 10: 34 - 43; 11: 17, 18). Now, in connection with the other vessel, the assembly, it is the actings of the Lord, and it stands connected with what Stephen saw. "They then who had been scattered abroad through the tribulation that took place on the occasion of Stephen" (verse 19). What characterised Stephen was that "being full of the Holy Spirit, having fixed his eyes on heaven, he saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God, and said, Lo I behold the heavens opened and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God". He testified to a glorified Man at the right hand of God and he said "Lord Jesus" in the full sense of the lordship of Christ. Those who were scattered would have a good deal to say about Stephen and what he saw and said. His was a wonderful vision of and a wonderful witness to a glorified Man in heaven at the right hand of God.
Rem. As to "the heavens opened", it was a pleasure to God to have it announced. "Certain of them ... entering
{343}
into Antioch spoke to the Greeks also, announcing the glad tidings of the Lord Jesus".
C.A.C. That is the Person they announced. The glorified Man at the right hand of God. When these scattered disciples go forth announcing the Lord Jesus, the hand of the Lord was with them (verses 20, 21). He has a far-reaching arm. He is at the right hand of God but His hand was with them. It changes everything in the history of a soul to get a sense of the Lord Jesus at the right hand of God and His hand working down here. It ceases to think much of man, though much of the Lord, and is then material for the local assembly for His pleasure. Antioch is the pattern for each local assembly in every place: the pattern of all the local assemblies in the gentile world. There is a power that nothing can withstand. A scattered people spread the testimony. The Lord is supreme, He is at the right hand of God, and nothing can interfere with what He does. "A great number believed and turned to the Lord". I see here the kind of people who find their place in the local assembly, they believe and turn to the Lord.
Rem. His claims and lordship were owned.
C.A.C. They definitely turned away from everything else to the Lord. They found a new centre and finished with all their past worldly or religious life. I call that a good fish -- one who has turned to the Lord. Not simply resting on the finished work of Christ, but turned to a Person, the living, glorified Man at the right hand of God. All expectation from man down here is done with, and they turn to the Supreme One in the universe of God, like Joseph in Egypt from whom all that was needed could be obtained. The Lord is the source of supply, the glorious Administrator. What a wonderful thing to turn to the Lord!
The first thing was that they "turned to the Lord". The assembly in Jerusalem heard of it and sent out Barnabas and he has something to say next, he "exhorted all with purpose of heart to abide with the Lord", which is a second thing; that is, not allowing anything to move one away from what
{344}
Stephen saw. Worldly influences would tend to draw us away. Without purpose one is like a ship without a rudder.
There is not material for the local assembly if one is indefinite. The third thing was that they were "added to the Lord"; we are then suitable to the assembly. How many in P. have been "added to the Lord", suitable material to be put in the vessel?
Rem. We are responsible to recognise that vessel only.
C.A.C. God would put before us the local assembly, where there are those who believe in the Lord. I have to learn what goes on there. Have I found my place in a vessel where I am safe and happy and where I am for the pleasure of the Lord? If not, it is an exercise for us. "A large crowd ... were added to the Lord". One is so put into contact with the Lord that one becomes available for whatever the Lord would do with one. God has purified hearts through faith; that is the basis for it all. We have to see to it above all other things that we give the Lord His place. The Holy Spirit leads us to say 'Lord' to Jesus (@1 Corinthians 12: 3), that is the kind of speaking that the Spirit would lead us to, giving Him His place of supremacy. He is Lord to command every blessing for us. He first of all commands blessing for us and then commands us for the blessing. It is supreme happiness to be under His influence and control, it is supreme joy and blessing. First you turn to Him, then you abide with Him; purpose comes in. You are set for things, you do not let little things hinder you from reading the Word, or from prayer, or from getting to the meetings. If you do, you are hardly added, joined to Him, available to Him to be put where He would have you be. It is a lordship of blessing; all the wealth of God is in His hand to serve it out to us. We need to be safeguarded from many things so that we do not lose the joy of it.
Then, when Barnabas finds this company of persons really "added to the Lord", he realises that they wanted the kind of help that Saul, the vessel of help to the gentile assemblies, could give them (verse 25).
{345}
Rem. Peter prepared the way with his witness to the death and resurrection of Christ; Stephen goes further with his witness to a glorified Man at God's right hand; then Saul is introduced.
C.A.C. Saul comes into teach: "And so it was with them that for a whole year they were gathered together in the assembly and taught a large crowd" (verse 26). They are now "in the assembly", which is a fourth thing, in the local assembly, a divinely prepared vessel, a public thing that you could see. It is "in the Lord". It is worthwhile to go a long way to see something "in the Lord". This is how the local company of believers finds itself together for the Lord's pleasure. Barnabas "was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith"; such a man will bring in Paul's ministry, he is a real help locally. All Paul's teaching is needed that we may know how to walk together, etc., in the assembly. Barnabas seems from the first to have recognised the grace of the Lord in Saul. It is a great thing to see what is helpful.
Rem. It would be helpful to us to catch that spirit.
C.A.C. It is most helpful to understand what is needed and to give place to it. We can all be "good". It is of the Romans that the apostle says, "Yourselves also are full of goodness", not of the Colossians or the Ephesians! "Full of goodness", never saying an evil thing of a brother or a sister. If you are "full of goodness", evil is not there to come out. If "full of the Holy Spirit and of faith", there is no room for anything else!
"And so it was with them that for a whole year they were gathered together in the assembly"; there was full scope for Paul's ministry. There was with them preparedness for ministry that would carry them through a whole year. What a privilege it would have been to have spent that year with them. Our individual history is reckoned by days, the assembly's by weeks, the "whole year" would speak of the whole scope of God's ways in Christ. How they must have gone over the whole range of those ways! The thought of the whole year is set forth in the typical festive year of old which
{346}
was gone through with God with something fresh about Christ before the heart continuously. In the first month there was the passover, the beginning of God's year, which was followed by other feasts up to the feast of tabernacles, "In the assembly" you go through the whole year. The year is divided into months. Typically, each month, each new moon, marked a special festive time, and thus for us special times in our soul's history. The whole year is provided for in the holy city, "The tree of life, producing twelve fruits, in each month yielding its fruit" (@Revelation 22: 2). "Day by day" there are fresh supplies of grace for us, then we have our weekly benefit of eating the Lord's supper and participating in all the weekly recurrences, while months would tell of special times of new illuminations and of a renewed shining like the new moon, additions to our knowledge of Christ. And thus we pass "a whole year". We are set together locally to go through the whole year with God and with one another "in the assembly", really in the vessel where the Lord would put us.
Rem. Consciously available to the Lord and to one another.
C.A.C. "For a whole year". We are regarded as being always there, gathered together morally out of the idolatry, folly, worldliness and religion of the world around in the place in which we are locally. Now you are ready for Paul's ministry and to travel through the whole year of God's ways in Christ.
Rem.
<blockquote>'Fresh and ever new are yielded <br>Fruits of life on that blest Tree'. (`50:2)</blockquote>
C.A.C. That is what I look for and that is what I am to find in the local assembly. There I learn to be a Christian, which is a fifth thing. "And the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch". "In the assembly" I learn to be a Christian. If we walk together rightly, people will call us Christians. The effect is that Christ becomes impressed on everyone. They carried the mark of Christ, they were Christians. Those are the sort of people we want to see
{347}
walking about in our localities. "Christians" was the only name they could think of with regard to them. The assembly is looked at here as a vessel in which we find our places morally, the circle the Lord has appointed and where we live and enjoy things in common with our brethren. We are glad to come together.
It is a great thing to be called a Christian, one who has an impression of Christ about him. God is seeking to put an impression of Christ on our spirit, that we may come more practically under the power of the anointing so as to come out like Christ, not simply more intelligent, but more Christ-like. Am I getting an impression of Christ? The testimony resides in the local assembly as the expression of Christ. The world around is full of impure and corrupting influences, but we come under holy influences when we come together, and they have their effect upon us and we thus get impressions of Christ which are intended to become expressions of Him. It spreads.
Rem. The testimony is Christ.
C.A.C. Practically discipline comes in to help that. If there is going to be a testing, the Spirit gives a prophetic word, a sixth thing, so that we are prepared beforehand for the testing (verses 27, 28). If I am not truly valuing the ministry of the Spirit I shall not be ready for the test when it comes. We get a warning to prepare us for the test. An old saint once said to me, 'I knew I was to have a time of testing because I was getting such an extraordinary ministry of Christ to my soul'. The test came and he was preserved.
And now we come to the seventh and last feature in regard of these believers, the beautiful care that was found with them, the spirit of love in caring for needs far beyond their own bounds (verses 29, 30), their "free-hearted liberality" (@2 Corinthians 8: 2).
Rem. Barnabas exemplified that (@Acts 4: 36, 37).
C.A.C. Yes, he had been "surnamed Barnabas by the apostles (which is, being interpreted, Son of consolation)".
{348}
We ought to be able to surname all the brethren, not nickname them. We ought to be able to recognise some feature of Christ in each one and give each one a surname. One would covet to have a surname, one the saints had given one in holy affection. The Lord would bring out some feature of Christ in each brother and sister, and that would be the name by which he or she is known spiritually, the features that come to mind when one thinks of them. What I am spiritually is my true name.
"And they determined, according as any one of the disciples was well off, each of them to send to the brethren who dwelt in Judaea". What one may have of this world's goods becomes transfigured. Instead of being "the mammon of unrighteousness" it becomes an occasion of manifesting the "grace of Christ". The messengers who carry it are called "Christ's glory" (@2 Corinthians 8: 23). It is His glory to see the bountiful giving of His saints. In @2 Corinthians 8 and 9 the whole question of giving is elevated and all put alongside the giving of God and of Christ.
There is a vessel at the present time in which we can find our place. These features that we have been considering together will guide you in regard of it, and see to it that you have these features yourself.
{349}
THE LAW, THE PROMISES, AND THE GOSPEL
@Acts 13: 13 - 52
It was after the reading of the law and the prophets that Paul stood up to preach the gospel. The law and the prophets were excellent in their place, but they did not meet the need of a sinner. The law brought home to men the knowledge of sin, and the prophets contained promises of grace and blessing to come. But neither the law nor the prophets really met the condition of men.
"By law is knowledge of sin". The law is the probe which shows the depth of the wound; it is the plumb-line which shows the crookedness of the wall; it is the candle which reveals all the filth and corruption of a sinner's heart; it is the sharp eye which detects the disease; it is the judge who passes sentence of 'Guilty before God' upon every member of the human family.
Then the prophets took it for granted that it was all over with man on the ground of law-keeping, and they were full of promises of future blessing on the ground of grace. The law had nothing but judgment for a sinner; the prophets had a promise of salvation for him. But a promise of deliverance is a very different thing from being delivered. The English residents in Lucknow during the Indian Mutiny, surrounded by thousands of foes who thirsted for their blood, had a promise of deliverance which, no doubt, filled their hearts with hope painful by its intensity, but it was a very different thing when they beheld their foes fleeing before the impetuous onslaught of the 78th Highlanders. Deliverance promised is a great thing, but deliverance accomplished is vastly greater. The prophets brought a promise of salvation, but the gospel declares that the promise has been fulfilled.
This is of great importance. For lack of seeing it many are strangers to the joy and peace of the gospel. "Of this man's
{350}
seed according to promise has God brought to Israel a Saviour, Jesus". "And we declare unto you the glad tidings of the promise made to the fathers, that God has fulfilled this to us their children, having raised up Jesus" (verses 23, 32, 33). The Spirit of God insists upon the fact that the promise has been fulfilled. Many a one will say, 'I am trusting to the promises'. Well, it is good if their faith has laid hold of God's grace in any measure, but there is a more excellent way. Indeed, those who talk thus will generally confess to having doubts and fears, more or less. They are really hoping for salvation instead of enjoying it. It cannot be otherwise. If someone promises you a book that you want, you look forward with hope to the time when you will get it. You trust to the promise and hope for its fulfilment. But when the promise is fulfilled you cease to hope, and you enjoy that which was promised.
In the prophets we find many promises of salvation, such as, "I have even given thee for a light of the nations, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth" (@Isaiah 49: 6); and again, "All the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God" (@Isaiah 52: 10); and again, "It shall be said in that day, Behold this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is Jehovah, we have waited for him; we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation" (@Isaiah 25: 9). So in Old Testament times it was "good that one should both wait, and that in silence, for the salvation of Jehovah" (@Lamentations 3: 26). This was what Simeon and Anna were doing (@Luke 2); but when the aged saint received the infant Jesus into his arms he said, "Now thou lettest thy bondman go, according to thy word, in peace; for mine eyes have seen thy salvation". The promise was fulfilled: God had raised up a Saviour.
It is not now a question of promises but of a Person. "Whatever promises of God there are, in him is the yea, and in him the amen" (@2 Corinthians l: 20). Whatever promises of God there are, all are fulfilled in the Son of God. The value of a
{351}
promissory note does not lie in the bit of paper, but in the person who has engaged himself thereby, and so salvation does not lie in the promises but in the Person who is the fulfilment of them all.
God has raised up a Saviour -- Jesus -- and is now sending out glad tidings concerning Him. "Those who among you fear God, to you has the word of this salvation been sent". If you have no fear of God before your eyes, you will care little for His salvation. But to those who have entered into fellowship with the dying thief -- who addressed his railing comrade with the words, "Dost thou too not fear God, thou that art under the same judgment? and we indeed justly" -- the message of salvation is a joyful sound. Never was a lifeboat more valued by the drowning, or a fire-escape more welcomed by the inmates of a burning house than the message of salvation is valued and welcomed by the sinner who really fears God. If you want to know what it is to fear God read @Psalm 51.
The rulers of Judaea had no thought that they were fulfilling the Scriptures when they condemned the Son of God. So far as they were concerned, they were gratifying the envy and hatred of their own wicked hearts, but God made the stormy wind of their evil passions to fulfil His word. They numbered Jesus with the transgressors, and appointed Him to death, though they found no cause of death in Him. Pilate said, "I am guiltless of the blood of this righteous one" (@Matthew 27: 24); the dying thief bore witness, "This man has done nothing amiss"; the Spirit of God declared that he did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth; and even Judas had to confess, "I have sinned in having delivered up guiltless blood". But in thus condemning the guiltless they were fulfilling the Scriptures. It was the will and purpose of God that Christ should suffer all that was written of Him, otherwise men would have had no power against Him at all. As it was, they fulfilled the prophets in condemning Him, and "when they had fulfilled all things written concerning him, they
{352}
put him in a sepulchre".
"But God raised him from among the dead". His atoning work was done: He had suffered for sins and died for sinners, and now God raised Him to be a Saviour in resurrection. He is now beyond the reach of Satan, beyond the touch of sin, beyond the power of death, in resurrection triumph, and this is the essence of the gospel.
The promises could refer to no other than Christ. The "faithful mercies of David" were connected with One who was not to see corruption -- One who was to be "as the light of the morning, like the rising of the sun, A morning without clouds" (@2 Samuel 23: 4). And now the light of that cloudless resurrection morning has come. Death's dark night, which for a brief space enveloped the anointed One, has passed for ever, and He has risen as the Sun of an endless resurrection day. Death has won no spoil from Him; corruption -- the emblem of death's victory -- touched Him not. Blessed, victorious Saviour, well may sinners bow at Thy feet!
Now we get the proclamation of grace. "Be it known unto you, therefore, brethren, that through this man remission of sins is preached to you". The grace that is thus presented to men can only be measured by the Person in whom it is set forth. If we think of His glory, His greatness, all His perfections, the infinite value of His atoning death, and His resurrection triumph, we may find sufficient cause and ground in Him for this blessed proclamation. Merit or excuse we have none. The accumulated burden of our sins might justly sink us to the lowest hell. But in Him we find One who is a propitiation for the whole world. On the ground of what He is, the forgiveness of sins can be universally proclaimed.
"And from all things from which ye could not be justified in the law of Moses, in him every one that believes is justified". The law could not justify a sinner, but the grace of God justifies freely "through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus" (@Romans 3: 24). Will you not receive this forgiving and justifying grace? Will you not receive by faith the
{353}
blessed Person in whom it is presented? He is placed before you in His attractiveness, and in His divine suitability to meet your need, that you may believe on Him and be saved. God puts no barrier between you and Christ;
<blockquote>'All the fitness He requireth, <br>Is to feel your need of Him'. (`208:2)</blockquote>
Let none persuade you that God is reluctant to bless, or that He needs to be moved to be gracious by long repentance and many prayers. Nay, verily, it is He who by His blessed gospel, and by the gracious strivings of His Spirit, is ever seeking to move men to repentance and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. And when man's stubborn will yields to grace, and he confesses, "I have sinned", there is joy in the presence of the angels. God is a Justifier and a Saviour God, and He delights to be known as such by His poor fallen creatures. If it were not so there would have been no risen Saviour -- no proclamation of repentance and remission of sins among all nations beginning at Jerusalem (@Luke 24: 47).
"By him, all that believe are justified from all things" (A.V.). The divine clearance of the believer is perfect and unqualified. It leaves no unsettled questions behind, and therefore no element of unrest or uncertainty in the soul. "All things" covers the whole sinful history of the one who believes, with every particular detail of that history. Who can lay a charge against one of whom God declares that he is "justified from all things"? Of what avail are ten thousand accusing voices if God justifies? (@Romans 8: 33).
But bright lights cast dark shadows, and if this pardoning and justifying grace be slighted it leaves the soul under greater condemnation. Take heed, then, to this solemn warning, "See therefore that that which is spoken in the prophets do not come upon you, Behold, ye despisers, and wonder and perish; for I work a work in your days, a work which ye will in no wise believe if one declare it to you". God has wrought in the greatness of His grace, and has caused His
{354}
gracious work to be declared unto you for the acceptance and obedience of faith. Be not a despiser of that grace, I beseech you, for it is still true that "whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed" (@Proverbs 13: 13, Authorised Version).
{355}
THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL -- THE REPORT OF WHAT GOD HAS DONE
@Acts 13: 32 - 41
Ques. This is a lovely gospel here. Does it contrast with Stephen's preaching? There was conscience-work in his address. He was trying to reach the people's conscience.
C.A.C. Yes. That was not exactly the preaching of the gospel, was it? If was a kind of indication of the ways of God and a bringing home to the nation their guiltiness. I suppose we do not get many examples of the preaching of the gospel in the Scriptures.
Ques. In verse 33 does "raised up Jesus" mean brought Him in, not raised Him from death?
C.A.C. It is the raising up of Jesus in the midst of Israel after the flesh. It does not refer to His resurrection, but to the fulfilment of promise in bringing Him in, as is said in verse 23, "Of this man's seed according to promise has God brought to Israel a Saviour, Jesus; John having proclaimed before the face of his entry among the people the baptism of repentance". It refers to what was raised up in the Person of Jesus who "entered" among the people. That is a beautiful word -- "His entry among the people". It evidently refers to what we read in @Luke 4 of Him in the synagogue of Nazareth; He entered as the anointed Preacher. We know that all the power of it was in the Babe born, but His "entry" among the people was after His baptism.
Rem. There is the quotation from @Psalm 2.
C.A.C. That is, it was the Son of God begotten in time. What strikes one in connection with the preaching of the gospel in Acts is the way what God has done is made prominent. The emphasis is on God and His acting.
{356}
This chapter ought to be of the deepest interest to us; it is almost the only example of Paul's preaching that we have.
Ques. Why does he appeal twice to those who fear God (verses 16, 26)?
C.A.C. I suppose he referred to the Gentiles who had been attracted and were frequenting the synagogue as proselytes. The gospel is properly addressed to that class of persons.
Ques. Would you say that blessing is impossible apart from that?
C.A.C. Well, there would be nothing to work on. Those are the only people who will profit by the preaching of the gospel, but then you cannot tell at what moment the fear of God may come into a man's soul; it might come in as he listens to the preaching. That is the foundation of all the work of God in any soul. The fear of God can come as an instantaneous flash of light, and it is the result of the working of God in the new birth. As far as the natural man is concerned we are plainly told that "there is no fear of God before his eyes". All preaching should be in view of the work of God in souls: you look for evidence of it.
Ques. To go back, would you say why you think resurrection is not referred to in verse 33? In verse 30 we read, "God raised him from among the dead", and then "*we* declare unto you the glad tidings" and in verse 34, "But that he raised him from among the dead".
C.A.C. He speaks of the Lord's death and of God raising Him from the dead, and then of His appearing for many days, but in verse 32 he goes back and begins again and says, "*We* declare unto you the glad tidings of the promise made to the fathers, that God has fulfilled this to us their children, having raised up Jesus". That is the wonderful fact that Jesus has been raised up -- brought in -- the Son of God, begotten in time.
Ques. In the Old Testament it is said that God would raise up for the people a Deliverer. Is the term used in the same sense here?
{357}
C.A.C. Yes. The next verse, "But that he raised him from among the dead" is a further thing. First He was raised up as the living embodiment of the grace of God, and that is what we see all through the gospels, particularly in Luke, where He is the blessed Vessel and Preacher of the grace of God.
Ques. Why is prominence given in the gospel to what God has accomplished?
C.A.C. Because the whole object of the gospel is to win men for God. This chapter is of vital importance to us, because it is the gospel as Paul presents it and Paul is our apostle. There are three gospel preachings given to us: one on the day of Pentecost, that is Peter's address to the Jews; one, Peter's address in the house of Cornelius to Gentiles; and here we have the preaching of Paul, and gospel preaching now only has divine value as it conforms to these three preachings. I do not say nothing is to be added.
Ques. What would you say about Philip's preaching? He preached Christ.
C. A. C. But we have not got his sermon! These are the only three sermons we are given, and they are models for all preachers now. What Paul said in Jerusalem and what he said before the Roman rulers were more an apology -- his defence, as he calls it. These are the three outstanding gospel preachings to be considered carefully by all who preach. We may have got on a bit, but I doubt if we can manage the business of preaching any better than Peter and Paul.
Ques. What about the preaching on Mars Hill?
C.A.C. That was not the gospel. Paul was there declaring the unknown God, but not setting forth the gospel. Sometimes we have to address men according to the conditions in which they are, and cannot present the gospel to them, but then you always have the after meeting in view! It is an essential part of the preaching. Sometimes it may be necessary to warn people to flee from the wrath to come, and to tell them of One appointed to judge and of the day
{358}
approaching, but then you will find there will be an after meeting! Every preacher has that in view. You see it in Athens; Dionysius and Damaris and others came to Paul because they wanted to hear more. The preaching is only half the business; you expect that someone will come up and say, I am deeply impressed with what I have heard and would like to know more about it. You find it here in verse 43; "Many of the Jews and of the worshipping proselytes" wanted to see more of it; they "followed Paul and Barnabas". What do we preach for if we do not expect an after meeting?
Rem. If a preacher had that in view how it would affect his meeting!
C.A.C. All through the gospels we see the principle of the after meeting; and Peter's preaching produced it; and Paul's. These are the models.
What strikes one is that the emphasis is on what God is doing. Paul begins, "The God of this people Israel chose", and he brings God into prominence all through. That is the wonderful character of the message and the strength and power of it.
Someone said to Mr. Stanley, 'I suppose you feel it necessary to be very much in prayer?' His answer was, 'Well no, I have such confidence in the power of the word that I do not feel prayer is very necessary'. He was a man of prayer, but he was not going to advertise that. That is not what he would have prominent, but rather the power of the gospel. He never preached, I suppose, without souls being converted.
The word of the gospel is all connected with the place which belongs to Jesus the Mediator. God has appeared to men in a Man. First He raised up a blessed Man in whom He presented Himself to men; then there was the great necessity of His death to bring in propitiation and redemption; then God raised that One from the dead. It is all what God has done, and now certain things can be announced. The gospel is not exactly an invitation, but an announcement.
He has raised Him from the dead, never to see corruption. Now if there is no corruption it proves death has got no
{359}
victory; death is annulled. We see that only in Christ, and nowhere else. If I look around I see it stalking abroad; it is not annulled there, nor in myself. I may die at any moment and go to corruption, but if we want to see death annulled we look at Christ. It is annulled there!
Rem. God raised Him from the dead.
C.A.C. That is the gospel -- the actions of God in Jesus, and in relation to Jesus. It is stressed in the preaching that God did it. You do not get that in the gospels; there you find that He is risen; it is the inherent power that is in Himself by which He came out of death. The gospel record ends in each case by saying, He is risen, not, God raised Him; they magnify what He is in His own Person. But in the glad tidings we see Him on the mediatorial side, and that would bring home to people how interested God is in them. The object of the gospel is that men may turn to God and get into happy relations with Him through Jesus. That is what makes material for the assembly, for such people are ready to serve God and praise Him. You have "received the word of the report of God by us", Paul writes to the Thessalonians. That is the gospel. It is the reporting to men of what God has done. Everything we see in Jesus in the gospels, all the beautiful perfections of His grace -- that is God! Every act, every word -- that is God! He is the Object of God's heart, given up to die, and God raised Him from among the dead.
Rem. The gospel is really the glory of God in the face of Jesus.
C.A.C. That is it; so that the soul that receives the gospel gets a wonderful impression of what God is. The old style of preaching was that God is a righteous judge and man is a sinner under wrath, and Jesus came in to pacify God and make Him favourable to man, the result being that many souls felt happy to trust Jesus but were afraid of God. Such souls have not the gospel.
Ques. What is referred to in the expression "the faithful mercies of David"?
C.A.C. That is very fine. The word in @Isaiah 55 -- all
{360}
connected with David as a matter of promise -- could only stand on resurrection ground. In @Psalm 89 which speaks of God's faithfulness to David and his seed, you find repeated references to heaven, and what is "for ever", and what is "established for ever"; that clearly looked far beyond David to Christ in whom all could be established beyond death. "Sure mercies" have to do with what is eternal in character. Nothing "sure" could be connected with a man who is going to die. After David had "ministered to the will of God" -- a lovely expression! How could anyone do more than that? -- "he fell asleep ... . and saw corruption", although he had ministered to the will of God. It shows that all that is sure must be connected with the One typified in David. All that David typified was seen perfectly in Jesus, and all is established in Him beyond death. If man is to be blessed everything must be put on the ground of resurrection. @Isaiah 53 must come before @Isaiah 55. God has been glorified in righteousness in the blessed One whose soul has been made an offering for sin. Now everything is on that footing. The very One whose soul passed through all the sorrow and sufferings of death spoken of in chapter 53 will "prolong his days, and the pleasure of Jehovah shall prosper in his hand". That is in resurrection. Then follows what chapter 55 speaks of. Chapter 53 had all been fulfilled in the death of Jesus, as Paul tells them (verse 27). Now remission of sins is preached -- remission in the absolute sense, which means sins are sent away never to come back. We all know that there are two words translated by our English word 'forgive'; one means that you show grace to a person who does not deserve it. In @Luke 7 we have this word: "He forgave both of them" -- that is, He takes up the attitude of grace towards all men, Simon and the woman alike; but then you get a second word in what is said to the woman: He says, "Thy sins are forgiven"; that is remission in the absolute sense -- the thing is absolutely discharged, the question completely and finally settled and dismissed, never to be reopened. Simon did not get remission.
{361}
Remission is the portion only of those who accept the gospel. The preaching is to make known the proclamation of remission, and those who accept it receive remission. The thing is so righteously settled that there is complete absolution. You can set forth to men what is in the heart of God. That is where forgiveness is.
Ques. Would you say that receiving remission we learn relief, but in forgiveness we learn the Person?
C.A.C. Forgiveness is in the heart of God. God holds no grudge against me. It is a matter of the dispensation. There follows therefore a warning; it will not be always so. "Behold, ye despisers, and wonder and perish; for I work a work in your days, a work which ye will in no wise believe if one declare it to you" (verse 41). There is forgiveness for all in the heart of God. That is the thought of grace and willingness to forgive, and that notwithstanding all the rebellion and obduracy of His creatures; but what is preached is absolute remission in the name of Jesus.
Rem. And that is where justification comes in.
C.A.C. Remission and justification are pretty much the same. Justification from all things is that the whole matter is so divinely settled that we may say with all reverence God cannot open the question ever again; it would be unrighteousness -- what is impossible to Him. It is the mind of God that it should be so. When a believer believes the gospel he has the consciousness that he has done something that pleases God.
Ques. I suppose Paul was addressing mainly Jews here.
How would his remark about the law of Moses -- "from which ye could not be justified in the law of Moses" -- fit in now?
C.A.C. The law was a perfect standard of divine requirement from man. Every man, woman and child has some standard; now the point is, could any standard justify? The law of Moses is the perfect standard, but even by it man cannot be justified. What is there really applies to all men. It
{362}
could never be right for a Gentile to steal or kill or commit adultery.
Rem. We might say that the preaching of the gospel is to bring what is in the heart of God to man.
C.A.C. And also to bring to light the work of God in the heart of men, "and believed, as many as were ordained to eternal life".
Ques. Is it possible for a soul to have the light of what is in the heart of God without being blessed?
C.A.C. There is a certain knowledge of the terms of the gospel in very many in a country like this, but that does not involve that there is any action of faith. Faith is a personal link with God. There is the feeling, 'If it is not true to another person in the room, it is to me'. It singles out believers from everyone else in the audience even though they all know the terms of the gospel.
There are those who judge themselves unworthy of eternal life (verse 46) and God accepts their own assessment. There is then nothing for it but to turn away from them to those who will have it. You bring that in as a warning. It is always the way with God. If you will not have what is in His heart for you, He will find someone else who will.
{363}
THE CHRISTIAN HOUSEHOLD
@Acts 16: 13 - 15, 40
C.A.C. One was thinking that in the case of this dear sister, Lydia, she had a very definite thought of her house as well as herself being for the Lord. We are not told particularly what they said to her but that she "heard; whose heart the Lord opened to attend to the things spoken by Paul" (verse 14). The effect of it was that in taking the place of baptism she brought her house with her.
Rem. The apostle could then enter her house.
C.A.C. Evidently she thought of her house being a place for the Lord. There are three spheres of responsibility and privilege:
Firstly, our bodies. "Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your intelligent service" (@Romans 12: 1). This is personal and individual.
Secondly, the household. A place where faithfulness to the Lord is manifested. In the mind of God the household of a believer is a sphere that comes under the authority of the Lord and partakes of blessing from Christ, a sphere preserved from the corruption and lawlessness dominating the whole scene around. Mr. Stoney used to say that we could have the millennium in our households. I do not suppose he meant as to circumstances but as to *moral* conditions, subjection to the Lord and security from evil. The household is recognised by God. The household goes with its head. We are all privileged to put the death of Christ between us and the world. The blood on the lintel (@Exodus 12) puts the death of Christ between us and the judgment of God. The Red Sea (@Exodus 15) puts the death of Christ between us and the world. It is the measure of our separation from the world. Thirdly, the assembly.
{364}
Rem. The flood was between Noah and "the world of the ungodly".
C.A.C. That immense volume of water was the measure of the separation between the ark and the world. In taking the ground of baptism we put the death of Christ between us and the world. The Christian belongs to Christ, so do his children. In faith the children are put on that ground for blessing.
Ques. Why is the case of the woman given us first in @Acts 16? And in regard to Moses (@Exodus 2) it is the mother who acts.
C.A.C. The mother often takes the lead: it is very striking.
Ques. Is the subjective state set forth in her?
C.A.C. Yes, the mother is the great influence in the household after all. Children derive character from the mother. It is good to see that the woman can take up the exercise. There is the baptism of the household after which the Lord's servants come in (verse 15). "He that receives you receives me, and he that receives me receives him that sent me" (@Matthew 10: 40). Where the Lord's servants can go and find a suitable place, the Lord can go and the Father can go: there is a place for divine Persons. The assembly is made up of suitable households, suitable for the Lord to come into. If the Lord is to come in there must be nothing unsuitable in the household. Lydia became the support of the testimony in Philippi. They went back to Lydia (verse 40). Things were suitable there. It should be an exercise for christian parents not to take up baptism merely because it is customary, but with the desire that the Lord's claims and His grace be owned in the household and His sufficiency counted on.
Ques. "The name of the Lord" is connected with baptism in the Acts but not in @Matthew 28. Is it because the household is the sphere where the Lord is recognised?
C.A.C. It is a refuge in the midst of evil. What a comfort to come ourselves under the control of the Lord and to bring
{365}
our children there, to "bring them up in the discipline and admonition of the Lord" (@Ephesians 6: 4), that they may be preserved from all that would be injurious to them. A christian parent would not like to put his children in the fire as the nations in the land of Canaan did (@Deuteronomy 12: 31). If you bring up children for the world you are putting them in the fire. One would rather be on the line of "snatching them out of the fire" (@Jude 23). A world of idolatry and lawlessness is like fire. We are privileged to be safe under the Lord's control. If I allow Him to control me I shall be safe and thus able to nourish the child in the kind and blessed control of the Lord. They are not to be vexed (@Colossians 3: 21).
To do what is pleasing to the Lord is the only happy path. If He had not died we could not take up baptism but we want the children for the Lord. The world is like Moloch, full of corrupting and destructive influences. We are safe and happy if the rule of the Lord is accepted. After I was converted it was my greatest grief to have been so long not under His control. There is no need for a child of christian parents to live any time in self-will. Christ's rights to him have been owned in baptism and he can own it and find real happiness in so doing and be preserved thereby. There is wonderful safety under the control of the Lord! The christian parent puts the children there in faith. They belong to the Lord. The christian household is a place where the Lord can come in and find everything there as He would have it be. One feels it is a very great privilege.
Rem. The apostle does not go into the jailor's house when coming out of prison.
C.A.C. Lydia had shown such faithfulness that the testimony could go out from Lydia's house and return there.
Rem. "If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord". I suppose questions are settled for children by their parents and thus it is a question of obedience for them.
C.A.C. Yes. "Obey your parents" and "Honour thy father and thy mother" (@Ephesians 6: 1, 2). A christian parent
{366}
desires the best good for his or her children. There is everything to be gained on the line of obedience.
Rem. The letter to the Philippians shows what the establishment of these first two christian households in Europe led to.
C.A.C. The assembly takes its character from the households. The households are, as it were, the base of operations for the Lord. If the Lord has not His place in the households, He will not have His place in the assembly.
Rem. The three spheres you have pointed out are most important. There are no claims like the claims of the Lord for He has died for us. One sphere is dependent on the other.
C.A.C. If I have come under His control it prepares me to bring my household under His control. The Christian has been encouraged himself first before he can encourage his children. We prove the nurture and admonition of the Lord ourselves first. His instruction and admonition is known first ourselves. Then, as knowing His patience and grace with us, we can patiently and graciously seek to deal with those who come under our influence.
All christian privileges carry responsibilities.
The first suggestion of faith on the part of parents with regard to their children in the Scriptures is in the *names* they gave them. For instance, Enoch calls his son Methushelah (@Genesis 5: 21) meaning, "when he dies it comes". What comes? The flood. That was primary fulfilment of Enoch's prophecy, "Behold, the Lord has come amidst his holy myriads, to execute judgment against all" (@Jude 14, 15). Methushelah died the year the flood came. After his death, the flood came. Lemech called the name of his son Noah (repose) saying, "This one shall comfort us concerning our work and concerning the toil of our hands, because of the ground which Jehovah has cursed" (@Genesis 5: 29). The earth after the flood typifies "newness of life" for us.
{367}
THE PLACE WHERE THE LORD HAS SET HIS NAME
@Acts 20: 7
We see here that the saints assembled on the first day of the week to break bread. In doing so they left, for the time, what was merely individual, or of household character. To use the language of @Deuteronomy 12: 5, they came from their own gates to the place where the Lord had set His name. I have no doubt that each of them could have truly said, "The desire of our soul is to thy name, and to thy memorial" (@Isaiah 26: 8). Scripture assumes that all believers eat the Lord's supper, for Paul speaks in @1 Corinthians 10 of "The cup of blessing which we bless", and of "The bread which we break". The "we" is the universal christian "we", like the "we" of @1 Corinthians 13. The breaking of bread is the divinely ordained rallying-point in christianity. It is undoubtedly characteristic of the normal coming together of the assembly of God, as we may learn from Paul's epistle to "the assembly of God which is in Corinth". Anything that ignores this, or the assembly order that goes along with it, fails to answer to the place where God has set His name. It is for the Christians who break bread to see that they do it with pure heart, and with due regard to the honour of Christ, and in the holy separation from all that is contrary to the light and principles of God's assembly.
The Spirit of God would teach us in @1 Corinthians 10 that the communion or fellowship which is involved in breaking bread is universal in character. To break bread locally without regard to the universal fellowship would be like eating the hallowed things in our own gates instead of in the place where Jehovah's name is set. We must come spiritually to a "place" which speaks of the unity of all Israel in fellowship and in approach to God. As to the actual coming together to
{368}
eat the Lord's supper, it is in "every place" where His name is called upon, but fellowship and approach to God are universal in character. While our assembly relations are taken up locally, it is important to see that they are taken up in the light of what is universal, so that in taking them up we embrace, in mind and affection, all saints.
Viewing the saints according to what is of God would lead to our being exclusive of every principle or practice that is contrary to the universal truth of God's assembly. We should tolerate neither sectarianism nor independency. We are reconciled to God "in one body"; therefore assembly approach to God must be in the recognition of this. There could be no stronger expression of unity than "one body" formed by "one Spirit", and that the Holy Spirit of God. "In the power of one Spirit *we* have all been baptised into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bondmen or free, and have all been given to drink of one Spirit" (@1 Corinthians 12: 13). The consideration of this raises exercise that *we* should be careful to be in accord with the character and unity of God's assembly. It calls us to self-judgment, and to serious enquiry as to the existing state of things in the christian profession.
We cannot accept that there is no longer anything that answers to the place where Jehovah set His name.
{369}
THE ENJOYMENT OF GOD AND HIS LOVE
@Acts 20: 32, 33
The time was drawing near for Paul to depart -- the spiritual vessel of uncorrupted truth was about to go, and what concerned the name and interests of Christ and of God was to be transferred to the hands of the elders of Ephesus, representing the responsible element in the assembly. Paul had been, in the power of the Spirit, a faithful leader of the people of God into the inheritance; he had kept back nothing; he had declared all the counsel of God, and now, as he departs, he commends to God and to the word of His grace those he is leaving. If Paul was going to depart, Paul's *God* was not, and the only way anything of God is going to be maintained now is by the power of the living God. The only thing to be afraid of is "a wicked heart of unbelief, in turning away from the living God" (@Hebrews 3: 12). Whatever is spiritually wrought, *God* is the doer of it. We see in Paul what He could do. God preserved him in moral suitability to the inheritance to the end. It was the power of God that did it, and the same God and the same power are available for us.
"And to the word of his grace". God is not making demands, but giving expression to the immensity of His own grace. He brings it freshly before us every first day of the week -- a presentation to our hearts of all that He is in His love -- coming out to us through the death of Christ to bless us infinitely according to His own heart. That is what will secure responsive affections to God, and it is only as loving God that the spiritual inheritance can be enjoyed. It is impossible to enjoy it except as loving God. The trouble is that influences come in to steal our hearts away from Him. If I loved God with all my heart and soul and mind and strength, I should have the same happiness now as I shall
{370}
have in heaven; and that is God's proposal. It is the supreme blessedness of the creature. God is not proposing an impossibility; He is proposing what is a necessity to His own love and He has given His Holy Spirit to form in our hearts affections which have their spring and object in Himself.
How touching that Paul should speak to the Ephesian elders about the assembly as that which God had "purchased with the blood of his own". Think what it was to God to have the assembly. He was prepared to pay *that* price! "The blood of his own" -- what an appeal! What a claim it makes! It is a matter of *righteousness* that He should have our affections.
We are apt to overlook the importance of watching against any influence which dulls the sense in our souls of the love of God. Joshua's warning to Israel is as much for us at the present day as it was for Israel, for what things were written beforetime were written for our instruction. He says, "Take great heed ... unto your souls, that ye love Jehovah your God. For if ye in any wise go back, and cleave unto the residue of these nations, these that remain among you, and make marriages with them, ... know for a certainty that Jehovah your God will no more dispossess these nations from before you, and they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which Jehovah your God hath given you" (@Joshua 23: 11 - 13). The two sets of influences are always there; the influence of the love of God and the influences represented by the nations of Canaan, the effect of which is to counteract divine influence. What answers to "the residue of these nations" is the influence of persons who are not governed by love to God and by what is spiritual; therefore it is of the greatest importance that we should preserve purity in our associations. If we keep company with persons who are of the world and governed by what is natural and not spiritual, the subtle influence of what governs them will insidiously and unconsciously operate on us all the time. Joshua speaks about the danger of cleaving to them and
{371}
making marriages with them: it suggests that they are attractive persons. We are apt to forget that influences which rob us of the enjoyment of God's love often operate through nice, attractive people, not through drunkards, thieves, or immoral persons. Nothing will do for us but to be set in our affections for what is of God and to keep ourselves carefully from association with persons who are governed by other principles. However attractive they may be naturally, they can never help us in relation to God; they can only become a snare and a trap, and a scourge, and thorns in our eyes. Let us remember, too, that *books* emanate from persons. When I read a book I put myself under the influence of the person who wrote it. If he loves God, and the Lord Jesus Christ is supreme to him, if he is walking in the Spirit, that man will help me; but if he is of the world, however nice and interesting his book is, it will be a trap and a snare to me.
The last two chapters of Joshua are a solemn test to us. Are we living in the inheritance and enjoying it? Are we loving God and enjoying what His love gives? or have we some underground passage which keeps up a link with "the nations" -- that is, with the influences of the world which are contrary to God?
Then Joshua has to say, "Put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the river, and in Egypt" (@Joshua 24: 14). One might be surprised to find this injunction after the enemies had been overthrown, the cities possessed, the vineyards and oliveyards enjoyed, but it is manifest the elements of idolatry remained amongst them. It is a witness to us that whatever God may have done for us -- however great the extent of His love and power -- there are still remaining elements which have to be refused. John, at the end of that wonderful epistle speaking of the truth of God and eternal life, writes, "Keep yourselves from idols"! There are always in the human heart elements which tend to rob us of the enjoyment of God and then we *cannot* love Him or serve Him. The devil would like to occupy us with
{372}
something of the creature so as to obscure the thought of God and hinder our enjoyment of Him. We can test everything in a simple way: does it bring God in or shut Him out? If it shuts Him out it is idolatrous. A man may say, 'I have my business to attend to', but you need God in every detail of your business. If it shuts Him out it is idolatry. Then a woman has her household duties, not surely to shut God out! Every duty requires that I bring God in, and then it will not be idolatrous. The blessed God is, in His grace and love, the Source of all supply for me. An idol is a troublesome thing.
You have to carry it, minister to it, do everything for it, and it will never do a single thing for you. Idolatry among the people of God begins in a hidden way. Things come in surreptitiously and are kept out of sight.
It is a sobering question for every one of us: am I enjoying God as much as I might? Every one of us must admit that we might enjoy Him more than we do, but what hinders the enjoyment of God is more or less of idolatrous nature.
We have a witness before us every week in the Supper that God has committed Himself to us in love -- a love expressed in the death of Christ: that is what the cup of the new covenant means. When we bless the cup we commit ourselves to it. It is a blessed thing for me to commit myself to the fidelity of divine love to support me and carry me through in spite of all that is in the world and in my own heart. That is the committal God looks for. We commit ourselves in the sense that we undertake to go on on these terms. God says, 'I am the blessed God and I delight to make Myself known to you in all the power and reality of My love. I am committed to it and now you commit yourself to it and you will be all right'.
{373}
PAUL'S VOYAGE AS SUGGESTIVE OF CHURCH HISTORY
@Acts 27: 1 - 44
In verses 2 and 3 of this chapter we get a hint of the happy conditions which were found in the assembly when it was marked by the work of faith, the labour of love and the enduring constancy of hope. "Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us". What a comfort to Paul to have with him that kind of companionship -- the company of those who were his glory and joy! (See 1 Thessalonians.) In those days of first love the saints were characteristically Paul's friends, and there was much "consolation of love" amongst them and refreshment of heart.
Then in verses 4 - 7 "the winds were contrary". The prince of the power of the air raised every kind of opposition. "Satan has hindered us", Paul says. There was great persecution and many contrary elements. There was slow sailing and difficulty. It was for the Jewish believers a transitional stage from the old order to the new, and this rendered movement slow.
In verse 8 they came to Fair Havens. This was the place God intended for them, and where they should have stayed. It answers to "without the camp, bearing his reproach". This would have been a safe place, but it was "ill adapted"; the outside place and the reproach of Christ are never comfortable to flesh and blood. And verse 9 tells us that navigation was "already dangerous, because the fast was already past". I think there is moral import in that. There is always danger when self-restraint is given up and self-indulgence begins.
Paul counsels them in verse 10. This very much corresponds with what we have in @Acts 20: 17 - 35. That was a solemn moment; it was like the pilot leaving the ship, but giving a solemn warning as to the perils of the voyage before them.
{374}
But we find in verse 11 that the official class will not heed Paul. It is striking how soon an official class were found in the church who disregarded Paul's teaching -- a clerical order soon sprang up who would not listen to the apostles. The effect of their counsel was an effort to reach Phoenice, a place which looks north-east and south-east; that is, it faces in two different directions, which rather suggests trying to make the best of both worlds. This brings us along in the history to Constantine's time and after, when the church and the world came into unholy union. For a time the south wind blew softly (verse 13) and all seemed favourable. When we are going wrong Satan does not stand in our path as a roaring lion; he rather makes things easy for us.
But soon the storm broke, and there was no power to stand against it. The true state and position of the church having been departed from, and an official class being in authority who did not heed Paul, there was no power to stand against the evil influences which broke like a tempest upon her. The head of the ship could not be brought to the wind. There was no spiritual power to face or to resist the pressure of evil; the ship was caught and driven before it.
Certain efforts were made in verses 16 and 17 which had their correspondence in church councils and the formulation of creeds, which helped to preserve things a little as to outward forms. But spiritually there was great surrender; "the next day they threw cargo overboard". All heavenly truth was given up. How could the worldly church retain the truth of association with a risen and heavenly Christ, or what was connected with the presence and power of the Spirit down here? So her precious cargo had to go.
Then on the third day "with their own hands they cast away the ship furniture". I suppose that church order remained for some time after the church had practically given up the heavenly calling and her true affections and hopes. For example, we may conclude that all was in outward order at Ephesus (@Revelation 2) though first love had been
{375}
left. But presently all that rightly belonged to church order was thrown overboard.
Then for many days "neither sun nor stars" appeared. There was no heavenly light. People speak of those days as 'the Dark Ages'. No doubt God had His witnesses in many a hidden corner, but as to the public history of the church it was dark indeed. And there was no enjoyment of food; "they had been a long while without taking food". Light and food go together.
Then after "a long while" Paul speaks again. "Ye ought, O men, to have hearkened to me". If Paul's teaching had been heeded, the church would have been preserved. But in spite of all this he now comes in with the cheering word that there should be "no loss at all of life" -- everything vital would be preserved. I think "Paul" spoke again at the Reformation and since. Justification by faith brought in vitality; it became a question of believing God, not the church. "I believe God". The just lives by his faith.
In verse 27, "the sailors supposed that some land neared them", and they take soundings. It began to be realised that the voyage would end in shipwreck even as Paul had warned them long before. The attention drawn to dispensational and prophetic truth, and the application of these truths to the present circumstances of the church were very much like taking soundings. This led to the position being realised. Ruin and apostasy were the only future to be contemplated here, but this was learned in the light of all that the assembly was according to the divine thought, and the hope of the Lord's coming and the church's previous rapture came distinctly into the view and affections of saints. It began to be widely felt by all exercised persons that we were in the last days, and that the coming of the Lord drew nigh. And every sounding is less and less. Even thirty years ago people would have been shocked at the things which are widely preached today, and religious infidelity gets bolder every day.
Then in verse 30 there is another movement. The sailors
{376}
wish to flee out of the ship and to go off in a boat, but Paul will not suffer this to be done, though it was ostensibly to serve a good purpose. The "boat" seems to suggest the dissenting principle which recognises that the ship -- the public profession -- is in a bad state, but proposes to remedy matters by forming little churches on a narrower basis than that of the assembly of God. But this is not really the divine way; Paul's doctrine does not allow it. The sad plight of the ship must be faced and owned, but the divine preservation is in being with Paul. "God has granted to thee all those that sail with thee". If we are with Paul we shall hold to the truth of the assembly, of which he was minister, and we shall not admit any sectarian or 'little church' ideas. Without attempting to form anything we shall walk with fellow-saints on the principles Paul laid down in 2 Timothy.
To go off in a boat suggests to my mind a giving up of the truth of the assembly. Christians associate together on the basis of certain truths, but practically give up what is the distinctive truth of the present time -- the truth of the assembly. Many things have become a "boat" in which saints have gone off from assembly truth. At different times there have been movements amongst those professing to walk together in the truth which have involved the practical giving up of divine assembly principles, and those movements have led to divisions amongst saints. It is a real exercise not to go off in a boat where we shall not be in company with Paul! We have to hold to every divine principle and to every part of assembly truth, whatever the outward ruin may be.
In verse 33, "while it was drawing on to daylight, Paul exhorted them all to partake of food". The light of a coming day begins to break. Peter speaks of the day dawn and the morning star arising in the hearts of saints. This is pretty much what the Spirit has been giving to many hearts in recent years. And along with the light of the coming day, food has been provided for saints. Light and food always go together; if God gives light He also gives food to build up the constitution of His saints. Salvation is found in the food supply.
{377}
Then verse 35 is strikingly suggestive. In connection with Paul's voice being heard the breaking of bread comes in. It is one of the most distinctive features of these last days that the breaking of bread has been revived. It was lost in sacramentalism for many centuries, but it has been revived and it seems to indicate a special activity of the love of Christ just before, and in view of, the end. It is wonderful that such a precious and divine rallying-point should have been restored, and that the saints should be exercised to get away from all sacramental and formal ideas, and to enter into what the Supper was in the heart and mind of the Lord Jesus when He instituted it, and all that He intended it to be to them as the witness of His love, and the answer to that love -- so deeply valued by Him -- on their part.
"He gave thanks to God before all". How sweet to think of this! The breaking of bread and thanksgiving to God go together, and both are revived in the power of divine love just before the end.
Then "having satisfied themselves with food, they lightened the ship, casting out the wheat into the sea". I do not know whether we might take this as suggesting that a satisfied people have something to cast upon the waters -- there is a widespread testimony of grace in the glad tidings.
Verse 41 is close to the end. Two powerful forces of evil meet with destructive effect. Superstition and infidelity -- ritualism and the sacramental system on one side, and rationalism on the other, and between the two everything is breaking up. Nothing will get through but the energy of individual faith, and vitality comes out in this. This is what we see in 2 Timothy.
Chapter 28: 1 - 10 is suggestive of the time to come when those who show favour and kindness to the people of God will come into blessing (@Matthew 25: 31 - 46). Paul's character is seen in his readiness to gather sticks for the fire -- a ministry of warmth and comfort; and Satan's power, figured in the viper, is dispossessed and nullified. Then we see the powers of the world to come in the healing of the father of Publius
{378}
and others. The restlessness and bloodshed which now mark the nations will be healed when Christ lays His hand upon them. God will make the favour of the nations to be comfort for His people (@Isaiah 60: 9, 10, 16, etc.).
{379}
EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS
{380}
{381}
RESURRECTION: THE KEYSTONE OF THE ARCH
@Romans 1: 1 - 4
There is one great fact, beloved friends, that is of vital importance; it is the essential fact of christianity. If this fact of which I speak is not understood in its true bearing and significance, nothing is understood of the things of God. People talk about essentials and non-essentials. I do not care for the expression, but if you like it, that fact that I am now alluding to is one of the essentials. If it has not the right place in your mind, I believe the whole system of christian doctrine is a confused labyrinth to you. It has no solution. You cannot really know God or His Son Jesus Christ; you cannot enjoy christian blessings; you cannot have proper christian character formed in you; you cannot understand a single truth of the divine revelation that God has given at this present moment, if you do not understand this vital fact. Many of you know what it is, but I want you to think about it. It is what I may call the keystone of the arch of truth. Lift out the keystone and the arch tumbles to pieces. The whole truth of God becomes a ruin if that keystone has not its proper place. 'Well', you say, 'Come, you have said a lot about it, what is it?' It is resurrection. Resurrection is the central truth of christianity. I should like this evening, if the Lord will, just to bring before you a few fragmentary thoughts as to this important fact of resurrection; and I read this scripture in order to speak of resurrection in its relation to the Son of God; and I begin with this because the Person of the Son of God is the centre and key of christianity. If your clock is wrong at one
{382}
o'clock, it is pretty sure to be wrong all round the dial. The Son of God is the one o'clock of Scripture. If you do not start with the true thought of the Son of God, you miss the proper force of everything in Scripture. We read in the verse we have been looking at that He was "marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead". It was not that He was any more the Son of God in resurrection than He was in incarnation, but resurrection was the declaration of the fact of what He was. It was the manifest setting forth of the truth of His Person. You remember that the angel could say to Mary, "The holy thing also which shall be born shall be called Son of God" (@Luke 1: 35). And at the banks of Jordan the Father could salute Him as His beloved Son. You remember again that the truth of His Person was revealed to His disciples so that Peter could say on a memorable occasion, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God" (@Matthew 16: 16). But you remember on that very occasion Peter's words drew forth from the Lord, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona, for flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens" (verse 17). The very fact of the Lord using these words is the proof that the condition of the Son of God upon earth did not declare the glory of His Person. It was invisible except to anointed eyes. None but those to whom the Lord revealed the truth of His Person could discern it. There was nothing, as to His condition upon earth, that could be seen. People said, "Is not this the son of the carpenter? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brethren James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas? And his sisters, are they not all with us?" (@Matthew 13: 55, 56). Now you see at once that no one who had seen Him in resurrection could ever have said that. It would have been an impossibility. As long as He was in flesh and blood, living as a Man upon this earth, the glory of His Person was veiled. There came a moment, so to speak, when the veil was taken from the glory of His Person, so that in resurrection He is declared to be the Son of God in power. The
{383}
very condition in which He is in resurrection is the manifestation of the glory of His Person. This is of immense importance. You see One here superior to all the power of death. Now that is the grand test. One who is manifestly superior to everything that sin had brought upon man could be none other than the Son of God. This is the true argument with which to meet a unitarian. You can imagine a wonderful person upon this earth going about and doing a wonderful lot of good, and the unitarian would make us believe that Christ was such a person; but I say, find me the greatest and best man that ever trod this earth, and tell me, where is that man in the presence of the power of death? That is the way to meet a unitarian. A man superior to all the power of death must be the Son of God. And as we read here, He is marked out Son of God in power, by resurrection of the dead. Well, I do not dwell any more upon that, I am only setting it out for you, but you see how vital, how important is the truth of resurrection as to the very foundation of everything; for every bit of our blessing and every bit of the glory of the new creation rest upon the redemptive work of the Son of God, and every part of that work rests upon the glory of the One who did it. Resurrection is God's attestation of the Person who is centre of all His thoughts and purposes for eternity. I think at the very start we may say resurrection is the one vital truth of Scripture and christianity. Now I will pass over to speak of it in relation to another subject.
"But now Christ is raised from among the dead, firstfruits of those fallen asleep. For since by man came death, by man also resurrection of those that are dead. For as in the Adam all die, thus also in the Christ all shall be made alive" (@1 Corinthians 15: 20). The aspect of resurrection brought before us in this chapter is in its relation to the victory of God. The key word in @1 Corinthians 15 is the word "victory". I do not know whether you are able to follow what I am seeking to bring before you, but it is very simple in itself. God has set His heart upon man; you cannot read the Scripture without
{384}
coming to that conclusion. If it is a question of the first man, Adam, every thought that was in God's heart as to man has broken down, as we have been reading, "By man came death". What a terrible thing it is to think that man has given himself over to sin and death; he has involved himself and all his race in sin and death. What does it mean? It is a great victory for the devil. You fancy death reigning in this world for four thousand years; just think of it: the whole history of this world apparently a triumph of evil. That is a victory for the devil; and @1 Corinthians 15 is to show how the victory of Satan is to be transformed into a victory of God. The very place where Satan seems to have got the victory is the very place where the battle is to be turned, and God is victorious. Out of that black abyss of death there is a Man risen up in triumph, and God is at last victorious. There is a Man who has got a victory for God, a Man who has gone into all the power of death and has so overcome it all that He could come out in resurrection. The first man is of the earth, earthy, but here is the second Man, and by Him comes resurrection, and you will find, if you read this chapter, which is pretty familiar to people who go to funerals, that God has achieved a victory and He is going to share that victory with the believer, so that, "as in the Adam all die, thus also in the Christ all shall be made alive" (verse 22). Thus if you have got a vital link with the Victor, you will be made alive. "The dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must needs put on incorruptibility, and this mortal put on immortality. But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruptibility, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the word written: Death has been swallowed up in victory" (verses 52 - 54). It is complete victory. What a triumph it will be! It is all based on resurrection. Take away the truth and fact of resurrection, and the whole fabric collapses. What is our future? It is to be with incorruptible bodies, glorified spiritual bodies, in the company of the Victor, to share all the glories of the new creation,
{385}
as the expression of the complete victory of God over death. What a triumph! You see what vast and magnificent results are going to flow from it, for we are told in verses 24 - 26, "When he shall have annulled all rule and all authority and power. For he must reign until he put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that is annulled is death". Now just think of that! You see a Man by whom resurrection has come, that is the Man to whom God could entrust the putting right of the whole universe, and God puts the sceptre that fell from the hands of Adam in the garden of Eden back into the hands of the last Adam. Everything that sin has brought into the created universe (I am not speaking of the abode of the lost: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth") is going to be cleared by the last Adam. He is going to reign till He has put all enemies under His feet, and the last enemy that shall be annulled is death. It is not our enemies, but God's. What a marvellous thing it is! There is One who puts down every one of God's foes, and we share His victory. I cannot travel any farther over that, but I turn to another branch of the subject, that perhaps we may be a little more interested in.
It says, "Now it was not written on his account alone that it was reckoned to him, but on ours also, to whom, believing on him who has raised from among the dead Jesus our Lord, who has been delivered for our offences and has been raised for our justification, it will be reckoned. Therefore having been justified on the principle of faith, we have peace towards God through our Lord Jesus Christ" (@Romans 4: 23 - 25; @Romans 5: 1). I want just to say a little about resurrection in its relation to peace with God. We have seen a little of what it is to God, and now we may learn a little what it is for us, and I am more willing to take up a subject like this, because there are many people who have not peace, and the worst of it is, they think they have. If they were downright uneasy, it would be better. The doctor has a difficult case when the patient does not think there is anything the matter with him. A good many
{386}
people think it is peace, when they know their sins are put away. But it is not. I believe that there are lots of people who sit under the clearest and ablest exposition of the Scripture, who have not got peace with God, because in the faith of their souls they have never got beyond the cross. In the information of their heads, they have got far beyond it, but not in their souls. I do not think anyone can have peace with God until they come in faith to a risen Saviour. I do not think a person has peace until he consciously stands in divine righteousness; and there is many a person who has the negative, but who has not the positive. They know the bad has gone, but they do not know the good has come. The one is just as true as the other. Justification is that good has come. You say, 'What do you mean?' Well, when the Lord Jesus Christ was on the cross, delivered for our offences, all the bad was there. Your sins were there. Every question of guilt that could be raised between God and your conscience was raised and settled there. The whole thing was settled. There was a Man on that cross under guilt: my guilt, your guilt. Do you believe it? "Delivered for our offences". Did He remove it? Certainly He did. If you think of who He was, you cannot have a question. But what is left, I would like to know? Is it simply that 'settled' is written at the bottom of the bill? There is something far more than that. What is left? There is a Man left in the presence of God, and nothing could equal the standing of that Man with God. Who is He? Why, the Saviour risen from the dead. You just think of it; think of resurrection taking up that blessed Victim. He had died upon the cross, He was delivered for your offences. Think of the mighty power of God raising Him from the dead. Do you think anything could be better, anything equal the standing of that risen Saviour with God? -- an object of perfect satisfaction, and rest, and pleasure to God. So that not only has the bad been displaced at the cross, but there is all the good in the Person of the risen Christ. You say, 'But what has that to do with me?' It has a lot to do with you.
{387}
"Raised for our justification", He is there in resurrection, He has glorified God in death. The fact that He is there has a distinct relation to me. The standing of the believer is identical with the standing of that risen Saviour. That is the gospel. I believe there are many who have heard it thousands of times, and yet have never reached it in the faith of their hearts. If I am in the standing and acceptance of that risen Saviour, my place of favour with God is beyond all expression. I am not merely in the sense of relief, but I am in the favour of God; I know that I am in God's presence in divine acceptability. That is justification.
I should like to turn over to chapter 6: 4, 5, 9, 10: "We have been buried therefore with him by baptism unto death, in order that, even as Christ has been raised up from among the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we are become identified with him in the likeness of his death, so also we shall be of his resurrection". "Knowing that Christ having been raised up from among the dead dies no more: death has dominion over him no more. For in that he has died, he has died to sin once for all; but in that he lives, he lives to God". In this chapter, or rather in these verses, resurrection is brought before us in relation to the fact that there is a Man of a new order in the presence of God. I should dearly like to make the sense of this plain to the youngest believer here, but I do not know whether I shall be able to, for I do not think there is any truth that the majority of Christians are so slow to apprehend as the fact that there must be a Man of a new order, for God. I know how slow I am to learn it myself, and I can sympathise with anybody; but I do see this, that God has entirely done with man after the order of Adam, and must have a Man after a new order: that is the truth of @Romans 6. I know that Christ came into the old order, and the worst of it is, that because Christ came into the old order in the days of His flesh, people think He came into it to restore it, and bring it back to God, and fit it for God's presence. People think that
{388}
God came down to man, in some way or other to lift man up to God. Nothing of the kind. I grant you that Christ came into the old order; He was made of a woman made under the law; He was after the flesh, in the likeness of sinful flesh, and as to bodily condition in flesh and blood He was in the old order. He always was of the new order, but he was in the old order. He came here to make an end righteously before God of that old order, and that was accomplished in His death. There is nothing that is less understood than the death of Christ, though everyone thinks they know all about it. It is a wonderful thing to see the Son of God coming down into man's condition. He came here to bring man's condition to a close, to terminate the history of man after the order of Adam, to remove man of that order from the sight of God forever. Now why is this? There is a reason for everything in Scripture, and I believe we miss a great deal by not searching out the reason. This is the reason: from the moment of the fall, Adam, and every man who is of the order of Adam, has to do with sin; he has it in him, and he has it all around him, and God's desire is to have a Man with whom sin has nothing to do whatever. That is the desire of God's heart. That is why He must have a Man of an entirely new order. What you get in this chapter is that the Lord Jesus has died unto sin. "In that he has died, he has died to sin once for all; but in that he lives, he lives to God" (verse 10). When the Lord Jesus was here in the days of His flesh, He had to say to sin. There was none in Him, but He had to say to the sin around Him. It was all around Him to grieve His blessed heart, from step to step filling Him with inconceivable sorrow. So long as He was here, He had to say to sin, and He had to bear the judgment of sin upon the cross. Now He has died to sin, not here for sin. He has passed out of that order of life, into another order of life in resurrection, and He lives to God. There is no thought of sin now, He lives to God. That is the sort of Man God wanted; God wanted a Man with whom sin had nothing to do, and He has got Him. As we have been reading, "Raised up from among the dead by the glory of the Father"
{389}
(verse 4). Now He lives to God, and as God looks on the second Man, there is nothing about Him to remind God of the existence of sin. God can find His satisfaction in that Man, without any thought of sin. He lives to God, and He is in a condition where sin can never come; He is in a new order. Now, beloved brethren, I cannot go into the practical side of it, but it is brought before us in @Romans 6 with a very practical object. You find we are of that order. Every Christian is of the order that Christ is of in resurrection. I wonder if you have got hold of that yourself, that you are of the order of resurrection. It is a marvellous thing. Our identification with Him begins in death; not in incarnation. You never can be identified with Christ as a man after the flesh. It cannot be. It is in death. We have been identified with Him in His death, and this identification is going to be consummated in resurrection; and in @Romans 8, it is God's purpose that we are to be "conformed to the image of his Son, so that he should be the firstborn among many brethren" (verse 29) -- a company completely outside sin, a company of the order of the risen Christ. That is the truth of God. In @Romans 1: 4, He was declared to be the "Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness". Remember that, "According to the Spirit of holiness". The fact is that nothing would suit the holiness of God, but having a Man completely outside sin and death. He has achieved it in Christ, and He is going to achieve it in us. What a wonderful thing; God has taken us up to be clean outside sin and death. I do not think anything is more wonderful than that, and nothing is so little known.
I pass over to another part of the subject.
It says in @2 Corinthians 5: 14 - 18, "For the love of the Christ constrains us, having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died; and he died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised. So that we henceforth know no one according to flesh; but if even we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we know him thus no longer. So if any one be in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things
{390}
have passed away; behold all things have become new: and all things are of ... God". I want very briefly to say a word or two about resurrection in its relation to new creation; and I think if what I have just been saying from @Romans 6 were understood, it would not be very difficult for us to understand this part of the subject. We are to live to One who has risen again. It sounds very simple, but I wonder what sort of idea you have of it. It is a grand thing to try to put down on a piece of paper, in black and white, the idea you have of some very familiar scripture. I try sometimes and I am amazed at my ignorance. This is simple christianity; we do not know any man after the flesh. What, not Christ? No. If we had known Christ after the flesh, we do not know Him in that order any more. He says, 'If I had been one of the disciples that went about with Him, yet I know Him thus no more'. "Now we know him thus no longer". He has passed out of that order. It is impossible to know Him in the order of the flesh now; He has passed out of it, but you may remember what He was when He was there. He is not there now. The Holy Spirit says, we are to live to Him. That is in the new order. We are to live to Him that died for us, and rose again. How are we to do it? How can you have a link with a Person who is risen again? You will not live to Him unless you are linked to Him; there must be a link. I know I have got a lot of links with man in the flesh; and my links, as a responsible man living in this world, are with things here, with my family, my business, with men. Anybody can see that. Now how may I come to be linked with One that is in resurrection? It would not be possible if it were not for new creation in our souls. He says, "If any one be in Christ, there is a new creation". What a wonderful thing! The important thing about you and me, and the only thing that can count with God, is something that no one can see. It is the mighty work wrought in our souls by the Holy Spirit, and every particle of that work is purely of God, as the new heavens and the new earth will be by and by. There is a bit of something in every believer in
{391}
Christ that is purely and entirely of God; and remember this, all the links of that new creation are with a risen Christ. It has not a link with anything here -- friends, family, business etc. -- it has not a link with your wife unless she is a Christian, and then it has a link with the new creation in her. Every jot of my being that is not of the new creation is going. Now just ask yourself how big you would be if everything were taken away except what God has wrought in your soul. I should be very small. Well, that is all that counts. There is nothing else that is going into the glory, but what God has wrought in us by His Spirit. Do you not see, this is very important, because it behoves every one of us to be laying ourselves out to cultivate that new creation. If you have no links with the risen Christ, it shows you have very little there. It is a wonderful thing that God has begun this work of new creation in our souls, and it is being furthered day by day as the work of the Spirit progresses in our hearts. This work of new creation is growing and extending, and by and by in glory it will come out in its full fruition, and be displayed in its divine beauty for ever. Now that is connected with a risen Christ. I will only just refer to one more branch of my subject before I close, and that is in @Colossians 3: 1 - 4, "If therefore ye have been raised with the Christ, seek the things which are above, where the Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God: have your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth; for ye have died, and your life is hid with the Christ in God. When the Christ is manifested, who is our life, then shall ye also be manifested with him in glory".
Here we get resurrection in its relation to christian life. People say, 'Oh, all that dreamy stuff about resurrection; if you would only talk about something practical, it would be better'. You may be quite sure when people talk like that, that they are as blind as bats in the things of God. I do not say they are not converted; but they are blind, they are like puppies that have not opened their eyes. The moment a man gets his eyes open, he sees there is no practical christianity
{392}
apart from resurrection. If a person has not apprehended the significance of resurrection, he is simply leading a good and moral life as a man on the earth. I know that cuts down a good deal, but not a single bit too much. It may count with man, but nothing else counts with God but what is on the line of resurrection. "If therefore ye have been raised with the Christ, seek the things which are above, where the Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God: have your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth". Now what is christian life? People say it is paying 100 pence in the pound, and doing to others as you would be done by, and carrying out all the practical precepts of christianity. I beg your pardon, that is not christian life: it is the practical outcome of christian life. All that comes out of me is not my life, it is the outcome of my life. My life is what is inward. No one knows what my true life is, but myself. You may judge what I am by my fruit, but it is not my life; it is the outcome of my life. Now where is the christian life? It is at the right hand of God. The Scripture says plainly, "When the Christ ... who is our life". It is very simple. Practically, what you are seeking is your life. I could tell what your life is practically, if I knew what you were seeking. If you are seeking money, and to get on in this world, you are not living a christian life at all. Christian life is not here, it is at the right hand of God; and if you are risen with Christ, you are to seek the things that are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God. You say, 'We have our duties here, and we have to go through them'. Yes, but then we are only here as servants; we are to do the Lord's will in the circumstances in which we are placed, but our life is not here. Supposing a man is working in a cutting in a mine seventeen inches high, lying on his back, is that the man's life? No, not a bit of it. His life is on the top, with his wife and family. He does not delight in being down in the pit. He has to be there, but his life is not there; and while he is down there at the bottom, his heart and mind are at the top. That is just what a Christian is; his
{393}
life is up there. He is risen with Christ, and the practical side is that he sets his mind on things that are above. "He that seeks finds" (@Matthew 7: 8), and if we were to seek those things which are above, where Christ sits on the right hand of God, we should get them; and we should be enjoying things which will be our life through all eternity. God does not want us to put off the enjoyment of our life till we get into the brighter sphere, but we must seek them now, and the Christian only enjoys his life in proportion as he seeks the things that properly constitute it; and they are found at the right hand of God; and we can measure ourselves by asking our hearts how far we are familiar with the things that are there.
{394}
THE GOSPEL OF GOD CONCERNING HIS SON
@Romans 1: 1 - 5
The persons who are outstanding as types of Christ in the Old Testament are Isaac, Joseph, Moses, Aaron, Joshua, Boaz, David and Solomon, but promises largely centre in Isaac and David. Isaac is Christ as the Heir-the fulfilment of all promise, but who inherits all as having died and risen. All that was promised in holy writings has been fulfilled in Christ, but Christ is the Heir -- the only One entitled to the promises -- "The seed came to whom the promise was made" (@Galatians 3: 19). "But if ye are of Christ, then ye are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise" (verse 29). We are of Christ as having the faith of Him (see @Galatians 3: 22). God's promise is the setting forth of what He would bring to pass as glad tidings for men, but it is all "concerning his Son".
But then He must "come of David's seed according to flesh". David is the man after God's heart who is to do all God's will. He represents Christ anointed to do God's will in kingly power. The power of evil being here, it has to be met by the kingdom of God coming in. The horn of salvation in the house of David His servant shows that what was seen in David typically came out fully in his Seed. He was marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead.
When He walked on the water those in the ship did Him homage and said, "Truly thou art God's Son" (@Matthew 14: 33). Peter confessed Him as such, also the centurion and those with him after Jesus died. There was in Him a holy power in a scene of sin and death, culminating in resurrection which marked Him as Son of God. It is plural because His resurrection could not be limited; its power extended to all saints fallen asleep. The Son of God was just as holy -- just as
{395}
much apart from sin -- in the days of His flesh as He was and is in resurrection. It is essential to the gospel that we should apprehend the absolute holiness of the Son of God. It was holiness which was the manifestation that His humanity was permeated in every detail by the power of the Holy Spirit. He was the fine flour of the oblation mingled with oil and anointed with oil. The holiness of God has been seen in a Man in this world; the very Spirit of holiness was there, for every part of His humanity was imbued with the Holy Spirit. It was not possible that He could be holden of death, and God has loosed the pains of death. He was held in those pains on behalf of others so that if He was loosed from them they were loosed also. And I believe that is why it says resurrection of dead (plural). His coming out of death means that through the glad tidings myriads will come out of death (see @Acts 26: 23). Christ through resurrection of dead announces light to the people and to the nations. There is no real light for men now but what Christ announces through resurrection.
Now this is the One who gave Paul grace and apostleship on behalf of His name for obedience among all the nations. The gospel tests whether men have any disposition to obey God. The law was once the test of obedience, but the test is now the gospel. Will men obey that which brings untold blessing? Will they submit to be saved and justified and reconciled and set eternally in God's favour? Now it comes to light that it is only faith that obeys -- a new principle introduced by God Himself into the heart of man. Those called by Jesus Christ have it. Faith is a divine principle used by God in the soul in the working out of His own election.
Faith is mentioned nearly thirty times in the first four chapters (of Romans).
{396}
NOTES OF A READING
@Romans 1: 1 - 15
Ques. What is the great feature of this epistle?
C.A.C. God.
Rem. I am not surprised to hear you say so; there are so many things predicated of God in these chapters, are there not?
C.A.C. Yes.
Rem. It is a great matter that the first thing mentioned in relation to God is the glad tidings.
C.A.C. I suppose in a certain sense this is the greatest of all the epistles, and perhaps the least known among the people of God. I say the greatest because it is the presentation of divine Persons and how God reaches His end in relation to His fallen creature man. It shows the blessed God in His own thoughts and His own movements altogether unaffected by what has happened to man. He pursues His own way and reaches His own end without any contribution from man whatever. That man is depicted in such a dreadful state is just to enhance the presentation of God. The glad tidings are concerning His Son; all hinges on Christ for the recovery of man.
Rem. Many think that the gospel is about themselves.
C.A.C. That is a great hindrance. The gospel is so great, and so entirely divine, that nothing but faith could take it in, and faith is just as much of God as the glad tidings.
This epistle was written to a company of believers. It is the greatest possible advantage to us that we should have the glad tidings of God presented as they were known to Paul -- "My glad tidings", as he says -- and he links it on with the Old Testament, showing that the gospel had been the subject of promise. Peter has told us that all the prophets since time began have spoken of these things.
Ques. Why does he mention the gentile company?
{397}
C.A.C. I suppose it is to show that this was what God had in mind from the very beginning, that whatever was spoken to men had reference to it. The Old Testament was full of prophetic announcements of what God would bring in, and it was largely the history of men who were types of Christ; the Old Testament Scriptures were in content largely typical of Christ.
Rem. The gospel is so great that it has to wait for God to bring it out.
C.A.C. So that God Himself had to be here in the Person of His Son before any of it could be realised, and Christ is seen not only as the fulfilment of all the promises, but as the One who is heir to all the promises. As has often been said, the promises all centre in Christ both as to their fulfilment and as to the One who is possessed of them. He is the One to whom the promises are made; there are no promises to the fallen man.
The glad tidings are not a kind of remedy, a patching up, but something that is entirely new -- the bringing in of what is wholly of God. Scripture speaks of Christ as the Seed to whom the promises were made. The promises were all made to Christ.
Ques. I thought the promises were made to the Jew?
C.A.C. Give a sample of one of those promises.
Rem. "Who are Israelites; whose is ... the promises" (@Romans 9: 4).
C.A.C. If you think of the promises made to the Jew, what has become of them? They crucified the One in whom all the promises were substantiated, and Christ has all the promises in resurrection; He holds them in the power of redemption. We only get them in Christ. No promises are made to me, they are all made to Christ.
Rem. So the Jews said after Peter's preaching in @Acts 2, "What shall we do, brethren?"
C.A.C. And he said, 'The only thing you can do is to be buried! Let me bury you out of sight'.
{398}
So that faith is the great principle of the first four chapters of Romans; and faith takes hold of divine Persons. Faith takes hold of God and takes hold of Christ; it does not think anything about itself. We are not called upon to believe anything about ourselves; we are only called on to believe what God is, and what Christ is, in the glad tidings, and man's case is hopeless outside God. It is wonderful to think the blessed God has brought in One who can take up everything, so that there can be unlimited blessing, but it is all in Christ; it is Christ who is exalted and made wonderful, not the first man. When God said prophetically that David was a man after His own heart who should do all His will, He was not thinking of David, He was thinking of Christ. David was not a man after God's own heart and he did not do all God's will, we know it was the reverse, but as a type of Christ he represented the beloved One who was after God's own heart and who did all His will; and that is made known in the glad tidings.
Rem. The worst possible view of man is brought out here in these chapters.
C.A.C. And God has brought in His kingdom. There would be no need for the kingdom if there were no evil here, but its presence made it necessary, and He brought it in in His beloved Son. He was untouchable by evil, Satan could not touch Him when here. Then He went to the cross to suffer for sins, and then He was loosed from the pains of death, so that men might be loosed from the pains of death and brought into life and blessing.
Rem. The fall really only magnified God.
C.A.C. The wonderful thing is that Adam in innocence did not need God as we do, he should have been perfectly satisfied in the surroundings in which he was placed. We need Him in a far deeper way, and our knowledge of God and the resulting blessing is infinitely greater than Adam's. 'O happy fault', Augustine truly said in speaking of the fall. It opened the door for God to make Himself known to His wretched fallen creature in marvellous blessing. It is a
{399}
wonderful thing to get the conception of a wonderful Person coming in on behalf of man, One who was untouchable by sin, who was "according to the Spirit of holiness"; and everything I am and everything I have is bound up in that Person. The only thing that has any value in man is faith, and he would not have any if God had not given it. So that if God sees it in a human heart, He knows He has put it there.
Ques. Would you say something about "marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead"?
C.A.C. Well, is not resurrection the great manifestation that He is the Son of God? There was evidence of it when He was here on earth, when He walked on the water. Afterwards when He entered the ship, the disciples said, "Truly thou art God's Son" (@Matthew 14: 33). They saw something of the power of resurrection in Him; a Man who could walk on the water is superior to everything here. And it is very remarkable that at the cross the centurion and those with him said, "Truly this man was Son of God" (@Matthew 27: 54).
Ques. Are we to arrive at that in heart?
C.A.C. I think we have not really got the gospel until we arrive at a true thought of His holy Person, and His relationship with God as Son. It is marvellous that the Gentiles should see the evidence of that when He died, and it is seen in His resurrection. It pleases me to think that the ones to be converted first after His death were a little company of Gentiles. It intimates that when the veil was rent from the top to the bottom God was ready to come out to Gentiles who had no claim on the promises at all. It says, "The centurion, and they who were with him" (@Matthew 27: 54). I see something very special in it. I do not think the Holy Spirit would have recorded it if it had not been genuine. Think of those rough Roman soldiers being brought into the light of the Son of God having gone into death -- how wonderful! It just shows how the heart of God was overflowing according to its own bent -- and of course, they had not the light of resurrection.
{400}
Now, the great testimony to His Person is resurrection. He is marked out "Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead". I think that has reference to His own resurrection. The word (i.e. the dead) is plural but I think His own resurrection is in view. I am confirmed in that thought by @Acts 26: 23 where Paul says that nothing else was the subject of his testimony but those things which the prophets and Moses said should happen, "namely, whether Christ should suffer; whether he first, through resurrection of the dead, should announce light both to the people and to the nations". The very same expression is used there, and it is evidently limited to His own resurrection. There is no true light for men now except through resurrection. The plural being used, I think, shows that His resurrection in another sense cannot be limited to His own resurrection. I see no difficulty in it, I see a beauty in it; His resurrection cannot be limited, it will extend to all saints. It is the place that all that believe in Christ will be raised to. If the pains of death were loosed for Him, then the pains of death will be loosed for them. And that is really the gospel; it is God saying, 'All that is made good in Christ is for you'. It is as if God would immediately give a testimony that the resurrection of Christ would reach to the saints. It was actually participated in by the saints who rose after His resurrection. I am certain they did not go back to their graves. With those who were raised in His lifetime it was not truly resurrection but resuscitation. The truth of resurrection was never manifested until it was manifested in the Son of God Himself; and in the gospel the preachers continually stress the resurrection of Christ as the testimony to who He is. If people see who He is they will on believe on Him. The great point here is, He is risen. Romans does not bring before us His ascension of His being seated in heaven, except for a reference to His intercession in chapter S. What we want souls to see is this wonderful Person. If they get a sight of Him they are believers, they cannot help it. Seeing is believing. Even if the
{401}
preacher says nothing about them or their state, they will go out of the room happy, because they know a Person they never knew before. We should like so to present that Person that there was no fault on our side. No one will see Him without faith, and God gives that. No amount of persuading will ever give anybody faith. If man is fallen and lost, how do you think that man is going to believe God? He never will. Faith follows new birth. New birth precedes faith, and faith is the result of that. Faith comes by a report, and the report by God's word. There is nothing which can value God's word unless God has produced faith in the soul by His work. Man is tested now as to whether he is at all disposed to obey God. If he is not he must perish eternally, there is nothing else for him. The law tested whether men would obey God, but the law was not nearly so great a test as the gospel. The gospel proposes the most wonderful things -- that men should be saved, justified, reconciled and set in God's favour eternally. Would he like to obey God? No, he will not! If God does not effect a very great change in man it could never come to pass. If the natural man could come into obedience, it would prove man was not lost. Those in whom there is a work of God value the gospel; those who are not born anew do not value it, they see nothing in it. It is important to see that faith is not of the natural man at all, it is of God. We believe to live. New birth is never presented in Scripture as life. It gives capacity for faith, and faith is the means of our coming into life. "The just shall live by faith", we live on that principle. Faith brings the very ingredients of life into the soul, it brings the knowledge of God. It is as God has His place and Christ has His place in the soul that I live, and that comes about as the result of faith. It is a new beginning; it is what puzzled Nicodemus, "Except any one be born anew he cannot see the kingdom of God" (@John 3: 3). That is, he cannot see anything that is written in the epistle to the Romans unless he is born again. It is impossible that the natural man could see one single thing in this epistle!
{402}
The natural man is responsible, and is so in regard of every single ray of light that comes to him. He is not blessed on that line, but on the line of what God has brought in and done. Faith is the mighty operation of God in the soul giving light as to what He is and as to the salvation in Christ. So that the light of Christ is the very life of the soul.
Rem. God would be ready to give faith to anyone. He gives repentance; it says, "To give repentance to Israel" (@Acts 5: 31).
C.A.C. It is man's responsibility to repent -- the only thing that God calls on men to do. Apart from God's work, preaching will not have any effect. "Ye will not come to me", the Lord said (@John 5: 40). No man becomes a child of God by an act of his own will. All are under sin, it says here; where is there any free-will there? It is the goodness of God that leads to repentance; it is well designed to do it, but not apart from the work of God in the soul. There is no genuine repentance apart from the work of God. And if God makes Himself available as a Saviour God, and His Son available, and the death and resurrection of Christ available for blessing, well, if a man despises that, what a terrible thing it is.
Repentance is that I judge myself in the light of all I know of God and of Christ through the glad tidings. The natural man does not desire it. "Depart from us, for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways!" (@Job 21: 14). The whole secret of blessing lies in the purpose of God to bless, and He is not going to be thwarted in His purpose to bless His own elect.
{403}
RIGHTEOUSNESS AND LIFE
@Romans 1: 1 - 32; @Romans 3: 1 - 31
The gospel of God is "concerning his Son", and "it is God's power to salvation, to every one that believes". God sends glad tidings to make known what is in His heart in regard to men. The Son of God was God, and He became Man that the depth of God's interest in men might be known, and this, not when men were innocent, but after they had listened to the serpent and come under the sentence of death. The sinless Son of God died that the true condition of the sinful man before God might be set forth in Him. As it is written, if "one died for all, then all have died" (@2 Corinthians 5: 14). But if the sinless One has died for the whole race under sin, His love has established a claim upon all. Not only has their true state been set forth in His having died for them, but divine love to men has been manifested in a most wondrous way.
We only get a true thought of what the sinful creature has come under by seeing what the sinless Son of God came under for us. But we learn by God's glad tidings not only that He came under it but that He has come out of it by resurrection.
God is greater than all the evil that is in man, and He has acted by His Son that we may be saved from the power of evil by a greater power coming into our hearts in the knowledge of our Saviour God. We need God in a far deeper way than Adam and Eve needed Him as innocent creatures. They experienced His providential goodness, but we need Him to bring us out of a state of estrangement from Him that He may have joy in us as those whom He has saved, and that we may joy in Him as the God of our salvation.
The gospel is the telling out of what God is, and of what He has done by His Son, for His sinful creature. It is to be known by faith, for the gospel is the power of God to
{404}
salvation to every one that believes. God uses the knowledge of Himself as revealed in grace in His beloved Son as His power to salvation. As this comes into the heart of men by faith they are saved from what came in by distrust of God and disobedience. They become pleasurable to Him as knowing and honouring His grace.
"The natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him" (@1 Corinthians 2: 14). Therefore faith will never be found in the natural man. Until persons are born again they cannot see the kingdom of God, however clearly it may be set before them. That God has come in to secure His pleasure in men is of very small account to the natural man; he prefers the world and his own gratification so far as he can get it. But when one is born again the true state of things begins to be felt, and the gospel which tells how God has come out to meet it in grace becomes a joyful sound. Faith is a divinely wrought assurance in the soul that God is a Saviour God -- that He is in that relation to men through the glad tidings -- and that He is to be known thus, as a personal matter, so that each believer has the light in his heart of God as made known in His Son. There is the power of salvation in this, for it brings us to what God is as revealed in grace. One cannot be happy with God in the truth of His grace, and under the power of evil at the same time. Every believer can prove this for himself.
Then the righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel on the principle of faith. It is "righteousness of God by faith of Jesus Christ towards all, and upon all those who believe" (@Romans 3: 22). This righteousness is purely of God, and the believer is clothed with it just as Adam and Eve were clothed with the coats of skin. God's righteousness is revealed in the glad tidings on the principle of faith. Neither the law nor human works of any kind have anything to do with it. Not all the learning in the world would show me how the righteousness of God is favourable to His sinful creatures. It can only be known by the glad tidings being received on the principle
{405}
of faith. There are three statements as to faith in @Romans 3 which are to be carefully noted: "The faith of God" (verse 3); "Faith of Jesus Christ" (verse 22); "Him that is of the faith of Jesus" (verse 26).
There cannot be any faith except as men come in contact with "the oracles of God" (verse 2). Hence we read, "So faith then is by a report, but the report by God's word" (@Romans 10: 17). If God did not make known something of Himself there would be no possibility of faith. But He has given "oracles" so that there might be something for faith to take hold of. And though some do not believe, that does not in the least degree take away from the present gain and blessedness of those who have "the faith of God". Indeed, nothing could be more stable, or more worthy of attention, than what God has made known of Himself, and particularly in His glad tidings concerning His Son. Faith has God Himself as its Object, and to have the faith of God now there must be "faith of Jesus Christ". It is through that Man that God is known as acting in infinite grace for His creature who has come under sin and death. He has come in perfect, holy manhood to do God's will, and to become through His death and blood-shedding a Mercy-seat. God's righteousness is now shown forth in justifying freely by His grace all those who believe the glad tidings. Redemption is the ground on which God can justify every believer, and His righteousness is shown forth in His doing it.
The blood of Christ shows that the sentence of death has been carried out; the sins that called for judgment have been judged; the whole state of man as under sin has received its righteous condemnation. But it has all come about in a wondrous way of grace, for the sinless Son of God has come under all that was upon us so that God might righteously hold us free from every charge. Justification means that God does not account that believers have any sins. They have committed many sins, but they are justified from them all in pure grace, and in the value of the blood of Christ. Faith sets
{406}
its seal upon the justifying efficacy of that blood, upon its value Godward. It has met everything that the divine glory demanded for sin and sins, and the believer has the faith of this. He does not believe anything about himself, but he believes the testimony that God has given to the value of the blood of Christ. In having "the faith of Jesus" we think of Him, and of the value of His death and blood as God has made it known to us. And every one who has the faith of Him is justified. The righteousness of God is upon every believer as the coats of skin were upon Adam and Eve.
It must not be thought that faith can be found in the natural man. It comes about through a divine operation which gives the word of God living power in the soul. In a word, it is the result of new birth. The fear of God enters into the heart and conscience by new birth, and a desire is awakened for light from God. For "The fear of Jehovah is clean" (@Psalm 19: 9), and its cravings can only be met by what is clean; that is, by what is purely of God. So that the one born anew must needs also be "born of water and of Spirit" (@John 3: 5) if he is to enter into the kingdom of God. Moral cleansing is effected as divine testimony is received, and there is the actual begetting of what has "spirit" character in contrast to "flesh". By faith I receive light from God, and I know it is purely of God, and I am perfectly conscious that if He has not begotten me anew I never should have received it. I know that the whole bent of my nature runs the other way.
Living is on the principle of faith in the early chapters of Romans. It is not until chapter 6: 11 that we are told to reckon ourselves alive to God in Christ Jesus, and in chapter 8: 10 we read that the Spirit is life on account of righteousness. Living on the principle of faith means that I live by what I know of God through the glad tidings, of which faith is the vital principle in my soul. What is of God comes into the soul vitally by His word and Spirit, and this becomes faith. Initially this is small; the measure of growth in this sense is
{407}
the measure of faith. I do not really live beyond the measure in which my faith knows God and Jesus Christ His Son. The gospel is the power of God to salvation to every one that believes (@Romans 1: 16), because it makes God known as a Saviour God. If there were no evil in the world or in our hearts we should not need salvation. But we know it is there, and if God were not a Saviour God there would be no hope for us. But He is a Saviour God, and He has sent us glad tidings that we may know it and get the benefit of it, faith becoming a personal link between the creature under sin and his Saviour God. Sin means that we have turned from God, and have lived on the principle of doing our own will. But the gospel makes known to us that God is ready to befriend and save us in spite of all the evil under which we have fallen. He is ready to set us in a far better place with Him than Adam had as an innocent creature. When we believe this our hearts are won back to God, and we see that it is our greatest possible gain to know Him, and to worship Him as the God of our salvation.
This all turns on the coming in of the Son of God, and on His death and resurrection. What was due to the creature under sin has come upon the sinless Son of God who bore it in love, but who has come out of it as risen to be the salvation; the righteousness and the life of every one who believes the good news. This gospel of God concerning His Son is His power to salvation. It brings Him, through faith, into the heart of His creature in most blessed grace, and when He is thus there the power of a divine salvation is there.
Then the gospel reveals the righteousness of God in setting the believer before Him without spot or stain. God undertakes to place every believer before Him free from every charge, and He glorifies His own righteousness in doing it. The righteousness of God is upon all those that believe; they are clothed with it so that before God no sin is seen; nothing is seen but divine righteousness. The believer has no fear nor uncertainty as to how he stands with God. Without God he
{408}
was lost and overwhelmed with sins. But as having faith in God known through the gospel he is saved and justified, and God has brought it all to pass, for none would ever have had faith thus to know Him, if He had not begotten them anew, and made them His called ones.
Faith is ever accompanied by subjection to God, for the glad tidings are "for obedience of faith" (@Romans 1: 5).
{409}
THE CALLING
It is helpful for the youngest believer who has an appreciation of Christ to know that the calling of God brought this about. The calling is entirely from God's side, and an apprehension of this imparts stability to the soul.
In addressing even an unspiritual people like the Corinthians the apostle laid emphasis on the calling. They, like those in Rome, were "*called* saints". It is "to those that are called" that Christ becomes "God's power and God's wisdom". He counsels the Corinthians to consider their calling, and to see that it included "not many wise according to flesh, not many powerful, not many high-born" (@1 Corinthians 1: 2, 24, 26). The divine calling itself dignifies the saints.
God calls men by the gospel. Paul said to the Thessalonians, "He has called you by our glad tidings, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ" (@2 Thessalonians 2: 14). Whatever the instrument used, it is God who calls; it is not the preacher, but God. Paul also speaks of saints as "the called of Jesus Christ" (@Romans 1: 6). It is very sweet to think that if I have an appreciation in my heart of Jesus Christ it is because I am one of His called ones. There has been a personal activity on His part in relation to me that has singled me out from amongst men to be for Him and for God. It was not the preacher -- not the one who spoke to me about my soul -- but Jesus Christ Himself. He has spoken in a direct and personal way to me, and the sense of that moves my affections.
The effect of His call is that the Lord Jesus becomes a personal reality. The most wonderful preaching in the world could not of itself bring that about. The Lord may use it, but it is His own personal and powerful voice that makes Him a reality to the soul. A person called does not always come to light in a moment, but he has a secret in his heart that is powerful enough to break through every hindrance eventually.
{410}
It has been known that a seed dropped into a crevice in a rock has had such power that even a huge rock has been rent by its growth. The call of Jesus Christ brings about in the soul something that must work its way out. We have examples in Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathaea. They were called ones of Jesus Christ, and the effect was that they came into view eventually as having an appreciation of Him in spite of every natural hindrance.
The calling is a divine one, and all the exercises and experiences of the soul stand connected with it. The effect of the call is that Jesus Christ is known in the soul as God's salvation. The greatest good has been brought in by God for men by the "one man, Jesus Christ". That Man "borne witness to by God ... by works of power and wonders and signs, which God wrought by him" (@Acts 2: 22) is now made Lord and Christ in heaven. The message of the glad tidings on the day of Pentecost was, "Repent, and be baptised, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" (@Acts 2: 38). How blessed to think of the saints as being "the called of Jesus Christ"! To such He has become a great and precious reality -- One to whom there could not possibly be a rival, for none but He could deal with sin and death so as to be God's salvation to the ends of the earth. He is the One in whom God has met the whole situation that has been brought about by sin and Satan's power, and the One by whom the blessing of God for men has come in. Every one who believes on Him thus, and knows Him, has been called by Jesus Christ.
That call separates one from all the schemes, devices and methods that men have for putting things right. Every sober person would admit that this is a world where there are many wrongs, and most would admit that they are wrong themselves, but the world is full of schemes to put everything right. When Paul wrote the epistle to the Romans there was much in the world, as there is now, which was thought to be of some value. There were moralists and philosophers, and
{411}
an ancient religion that had been originally of God. But Paul stands out as a man separated from all these things, separated to God's glad tidings. He has a theme, but it admits of no mixture. God's glad tidings stand alone, and cannot be linked up with any other plan for the supposed good of man.
As subjects of the divine call we realise that everything centres in that one Man. The one called of Jesus Christ may have to learn many things, but he is assured that everything hangs on Him. The apostles, in spite of much dullness and ignorance, had the sense that all depended on Him; they said, "To whom shall we go?" The saints -- called such by God -- have the conviction in their souls that His Son, Jesus Christ, is the one Man who can bring in everything on God's part for men. He can deal with everything that men are under by reason of sin. It is proved because He can bring people out of death, and if He can do that He can do anything.
Paul says to the Corinthians, "Jesus Christ is in you"; also, "Prove your own selves: ... that Jesus Christ is in you" (@2 Corinthians 13: 5). They could not deny it. One called of Jesus Christ cannot deny that Jesus Christ is in him. This is not a thing that can be blown away by a gust of wind; the calling is a substantial, divine reality which all the power of Satan cannot disannul.
It is a call from heaven; nothing could be more effective than that. Every young believer should get a sense of the reality of it. If we have an appreciation of Jesus Christ, we have it as a result of His call which establishes a personal link with Him. The initial thing is the divine call.
{412}
INCORRUPTIBILITY
@Romans 1: 21 - 23; @2 Timothy 1: 8 - 11; @Romans 2: 5 - 7
It helps in the understanding of incorruptibility to see that it is characteristic of God -- He is the incorruptible God. That shows clearly that a great spiritual thought is suggested to us in incorruptibility. It has been too often limited in our thoughts to bodily condition, but incorruptibility is a spiritual thought; we see that when we recognise that God is the incorruptible God. That is the key to the subject. Indeed what God is must be the key to the whole system of divine truth; in the universe which is for the pleasure of God everything must correspond with Him.
It is impossible that there could be any change or decay with God. Whatever there may be on the side of the creature, whatever God may have to say to in the creature, and He has had to say to the creature as innocent and fallen, as sinful without law and as a transgressor under law, and as a hater and rejector of Christ, but whatever there may be on the side of the creature, God remains the incorruptible God; there is no change in Him; nothing can by any possibility make God to be other than what He is. The secret of all blessing and spiritual stability, and of our confidence in God, lies in our knowing Him as the incorruptible God. But if God is the incorruptible God everything that is for His pleasure must be brought into correspondence with Himself, and therefore He is going to put the impress of incorruptibility on the whole reconciled universe.
The object of the enemy in setting up the vast system of idolatry was to destroy the thought of the incorruptibility of God. We read in @Romans 1 that they "changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of an image of corruptible man and of birds and quadrupeds and reptiles".
{413}
Satan would have men to think of God as being like what man is, or some other inferior creature. A false thought of God must be destructive. "They glorified him not as God". The root principle of stability for our souls is that we should glorify God as God. The whole population of the world stood round Noah's altar; they all knew God; but they did not continue to glorify Him as God. The two things which mark the ruin of the creature are that he does not glorify God as God, and he is not thankful.
Man is corruptible; there is no correspondence between God as incorruptible and man as corruptible. Man as made out of dust is corruptible, and at every phase of his history he has been manifested to be so. In innocence, the moment temptation came he lost the character which attached to him by God's creation, and we see all through Scripture that whatever glory or distinction God was pleased to put upon man only served to make manifest that man was corruptible.
Incorruptibility was not brought to light until the gospel came. There was a long period in which it was being manifested that man the creature was not in correspondence with God. But it was that state of things which gave God occasion to work to bring about that man should be brought into correspondence with Himself by our Saviour Jesus Christ. God has now secured an incorruptible Man. It is of all importance for us to see that we have to do with an incorruptible God whose nature does not change, whose attributes do not change, whose thoughts and purposes do not change. And it is equally important to see also that God has secured an incorruptible Man, and if men are to be blessed at all it must be by and in that Man.
Life and incorruptibility have come to light and subsist; there is a blessed Man with God now in life and incorruptibility. The man made out of dust has fallen under sin and Satan's power; he is marked by weakness and death; he is lost. But the power of God has come in by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, and by His annulling death, to save
{414}
us from everything that was connected with the corruptible man. Death had to be annulled, for it was the judgment of God upon man as having sinned. It was met by our Saviour Jesus Christ going into it, and tasting all its dread reality and power. But the fact that He entered into death has annulled death. So far as Christ is concerned death is absolutely void and of none effect, for it has not been able to hold Him. He lives as a risen Man for God's pleasure eternally. Life and incorruptibility have come to light, and are available for men.
Man in the Person of our Saviour Jesus Christ is in blessed relation to God outside the power and shadow of death, and in an incorruptible state and condition. And He is the subject of God's glad tidings to sinful men. There is a necessity that man as under the power of sin and death should be saved. Paul writes to Timothy of "the power of God; who has saved us". Paul and Timothy were saved men, and if these two -- and many others -- were saved, it shows what the power of God is doing for men. It has come to light as acting in the way of salvation, and bringing in life and incorruptibility.
Paul says, "I have been appointed a herald and apostle and teacher of the nations". He heralded forth in the glad tidings salvation and life and incorruptibility, and he taught the character of the glad tidings that men might learn to seek after glory and honour and incorruptibility. We see in @Romans 2 that these things become objects of pursuit to men. They are substantial realities set forth in Christ, and presented in the glad tidings so as to become a goal of pursuit. The effect of the gospel is to put people in movement in the direction of glory, honour and incorruptibility. The measure in which the gospel has come in power to our souls is the measure in which we are in movement in that direction.
I believe the thought of "glory" is that everything will be made to correspond with God. He is the God of glory and the Father of glory -- the Originator of the whole system of
{415}
glory. He will eventually bring the whole moral universe into correspondence with Himself so that ultimately He will be all in all. It is a wonderful conception of glory. I am sure that God would awaken desires in men's souls for glory, honour and incorruptibility. One great secret of spiritual weakness is that we are not intensely interested in these things. If God presents a goal we may be sure that it is an intensely attractive one.
In the world, if a great prize is offered it awakens interest and there are many competitors. But God sets before us the most wonderful goal that could be presented to intelligent creatures. Paul says, They do it "that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible" (@1 Corinthians 9: 25). In view of winning such a wonderful prize he kept his body under. If we have incorruptibility in view we must keep ourselves in training; it can only be reached in a spiritual way. The practical line on which it is sought is "patient continuance of good work". The soul moves on with good. We are in a scene of unspeakable disorder; the will of the flesh and all that we are naturally is on the line of evil; but if we come under the powerful influence and attraction of glory, honour and incorruptibility as set forth to our faith and affections in our Lord Jesus Christ it will put us on the line of patient continuance of good work. It is work in the singular -- the life looked at as a continuance in good.
There is a necessity for a divine beginning in the saints. Peter says, "All flesh is as grass, and all its glory as the flower of grass". That is the corruptible man which decays, but in contrast with that he says, "Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the living and abiding word of God". He adds that "the word of the Lord abides for eternity", and that "this is the word which in the glad tidings is preached to you". The believer has been born again by that which expresses God, and is therefore incorruptible. His word is incorruptible seed, and we are born again by it. One desires to look at one's brethren in the light of the
{416}
incorruptible element that is there -- something that is in contrast to the flesh which is as grass, and the flower of grass. If our souls were brought more into the reality of these things we should be marked by incorruptible affections. We read of love in incorruption at the end of Ephesians. If we love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptibility we are marked by affections that are of an unchanging and imperishable order. One covets this, for one has had a little experience of the changeableness which one finds in one's own nature. A servant of the Lord has said,
<blockquote>'No infant's changing pleasure <br>Is like my wandering mind'. (`51:2)</blockquote>
If we have realised that, it awakens longing for an incorruptible and unchanging character of things, where
<blockquote>'Filled with Thee, the constant mind <br>Eternally is blest'. (`178:3)</blockquote>
As we are filled with God made known to us in Jesus His beloved Son, an element of incorruptibility is brought in. It is well for us to desire to get morally apart from the fickle changeability which marks us naturally, and to reach the incorruptibility which marks the divine nature. Peter shows the beautiful way in which the incorruptible element will develop in the saints. He speaks about the "hidden man of the heart" and "the incorruptible ornament of a meek and quiet spirit".
Being made partakers of the divine nature is the result of learning God. It is by "the greatest and precious promises" (@2 Peter l: 4). Indeed God Himself becomes to His people the great Promise of everything
<blockquote>'In the desert God will teach thee <br>What the God that thou hast found'. (`76:6)</blockquote>
Every trial and testing casts us upon God, and we find God pledged to us in love, and as we learn Him thus we are
{417}
formed in the divine nature, and we come into correspondence with Him. "Be ye holy, for I am holy", and then, "Love one another out of a pure heart fervently". Holiness and love pertain to the divine nature.
Then the thought of incorruptibility is connected with teaching in @Titus 2: 7. A wrong thought of God or Christ is an element which may develop into any amount of error. If what is taught is the truth it is marked by incorruptibility. We should not in teaching go beyond what we are assured to be of God. "If any one speak -- as oracles of God". However little a man knows, if he does not go beyond his depth he will not teach error. We blunder by going beyond our depth, but there is divine support if we keep within our measure. If I only said to others what I could truly say I had learned from God I should say nothing wrong. In true ministry there is no place for crude or undigested thoughts, or for things being said in self-confidence through the activity of the human mind. Teaching should be according to the measure in which we are taught. The Lord Himself taught that way. "The Lord Jehovah hath given me the tongue of the instructed" (@Isaiah 50: 4). If we only taught others what God had taught us the teaching would be incorruptible.
Resurrection will be an appropriate finish to what we have considered. If the saints move on the line of these characteristics and affections the appropriate conclusion of such a course will be to put on incorruptibility even as to bodily condition. "For this corruptible must needs put on incorruptibility, and this mortal put on immortality" (@1 Corinthians 15: 53). "Pious men buried Stephen". I have no doubt they were deeply sensible that they were sowing a suitable seed for the resurrection unto life. The body of a saint has been indwelt by the Holy Spirit, and it has been devoted as a living sacrifice to God. If he puts off his tabernacle it will be sown in corruption but "raised in incorruptibility". God will find His pleasure eternally in an order of things brought into perfect correspondence with Himself. Neither inwardly nor
{418}
outwardly will there be any element of change or decay. The stability of the whole system will be secured by the place God has in it, and by everything being brought into perfect correspondence with Him. It is a conception which is in every way worthy of God.
{419}
NOTES OF A READING
@Romans 2: 1 - 29
C.A.C. We see the pains God has taken to give testimony to Himself to man in the creation in chapter 1: 19, 20, which shows God has given man power in his mind to apprehend the testimony of creation. It is the most universal testimony that God has ever rendered. And all this is to render them inexcusable. There is a testimony to God's eternal power and divinity to every human being in the things that are made.
Rem. There is nothing said of His heart and feelings.
C.A.C. No, we wait for the gospel for that, but the testimony is there.
Rem. It would appeal to the most ordinary thinking man -- the trees and bushes he sees. A man of ordinary intelligence should apprehend it.
C.A.C. Do you not think that man would really know enough, but he is not prepared to be governed even by what he knows? Most in this country know a good deal, but they are not prepared to be governed by what they know. God has given the knowledge of good and evil, and men apply that to the conscience, and they know whether they are doing evil.
It is remarkable how Paul speaks to the people in @Acts 14: 15 - 17 after the healing of the impotent man at Lystra. He does not say a word about the gospel. He takes it for granted that it was a very substantial ground on which to appeal to them, that they had all had experience of God's goodness. "He did not leave himself without witness, doing good, and giving to you from heaven rain and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness".
Verses 21 and onward of chapter 1 refer really to the world after the flood. We do not know that there was any idolatry before the flood; there was violence and corruption. Very soon indeed after the flood they became idolaters, and
{420}
Abraham's father was an idolater. Everybody knew about the flood, but of Terah it says he served other gods; it is very solemn.
Ques. How far does the thought of God as Creator enter into our own exercises?
C.A.C. It is important that we should glorify God in this way. The only assembly prayer we have recorded is addressed to the Creator (@Acts 4: 24 - 30). There is only one hymn in our book in praise of God in creation, and it is there because there is no other. We must not leave out this very great thought of God as Creator.
There is a remarkable title of God in verse 23. "They ... changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of an image of corruptible man". "The incorruptible God" does not occur in the Old Testament, but has a very definite place in the New. That is, God intended that man should look up to Him as the incorruptible God in presence of all the corruption that had come in through sin. In the presence of that state of things Noah walked with God, and he was preserved. He was the only man to do so at that time. Man ought to find the natural object of his heart in the midst of what he is as corrupt in the God that is incorruptible. We ought not to leave this out of the gospel. Have you ever heard Him presented thus in the preaching, Mr. B?
Rem. No, I do not think I have.
C.A.C. Well, we better make a move on! It is important because the whole character of christian blessing takes form from that fact. Nothing will suit God as the incorruptible God but that man should be brought into an incorruptible order of things, into incorruptibility. That is the great truth of christianity, and the thing has been accomplished already in Christ. An incorruptible order of things is begun with saints now as born of incorruptible seed. The old man corrupts itself according to the deceitful lusts, but the new man is created in righteousness and holiness of the truth. The new man takes on the new character of man morally, and the
{421}
saints will put on incorruptibility when raised. Meanwhile incorruptibility is brought to light through the gospel. So that life and incorruptibility are to be announced to man in the glad tidings. What a contrast to the corruption that is in the world!
See what immense thoughts come out of this, all wrapped up in a few words. There are certain persons looking "for glory and honour and incorruptibility" in the chapter we read. Well, they will only find it in Christ. The angels are holy, they are not said to be incorruptible. When you get hold of this, you get an order of things before you that is essentially outside the range of man. God never had any thought that incorruptibility should attach to Adam; incorruptibility for man, seeing sin and death came in, can only be in resurrection. It is an order of things entirely of God, and it has the same character as the righteousness of God; a whole state of things is brought in characterised by incorruptibility and honour and glory. And God is saying, so to speak, 'If you seek that I shall be very pleased with you, so pleased with you that I will give you eternal life'.
It is in Christ risen that glory and honour and incorruptibility are found livingly. He is the One presented in the gospel, and men believe on Him to get these wondrous things. Idolatry is most degrading. What is there to look up to in the image of a bird or reptile? But if we look up to the incorruptible God and to Christ as the One in whom these things are found, these are elevating thoughts. Man cannot rise above what he worships, can he? In naming Eve, Adam saw life was coming in from God. He might have called her 'The mother of all dying'.
We need to let God have that place and character that belongs to Him. Looking up to God, He becomes the measure of our expectation and our hope. I suppose every truly repentant soul has a sense of the utter impossibility of God being touched by any power of sin. God is entirely outside it all. He is entirely incorruptible and the soul links itself on
{422}
with Him. The greatest miracle in the universe is a conversion -- that a poor creature oppressed with sin should link himself on with the incorruptible God -- it is fine!
This would do away with all idolatry; it is not worthwhile! Among the last words of John to the assembly is, "Children, keep yourselves from idols". How foolish we are to shut out such blessedness by a trifle not worth anything! This epistle (Romans) is written that our souls should come into the blessedness of God as known in the gospel and in sonship.
To know right and wrong and to be able to put anyone else right is of no advantage to the natural man, as we see in the second chapter. To have light is no advantage unless we come personally into line with it. Those who give God a place and Christ a place are marked by "patient continuance of good works". They are steadily on the line of good, they are born anew.
Rem. They are on God's line, and the issue for God is good.
Rem. The judgment is according to the way man responds to the light received from God; it is according to his works. It is very salutary for us.
C.A.C. And it is rather important to note that it is not 'good works' but "work" (@Romans 2: 15); that is, the whole character of the life is continuing in what is good.
The fourth verse is not exactly His gospel goodness. He is always acting towards His creature man in the riches of His long-suffering, and His goodness is intended to lead men to repentance. Every human being has some experience of the goodness of God.
It is not "to Jew first" now (verse 10). The last chapter of the Acts brings us to the definite point where the Jew is given up. "Be it known to you therefore, that this salvation of God has been sent to the nations; *they* also will hear it" (@Acts 28: 28). The Gentiles have priority now, and the Jew must come in on the same footing -- as a poor bankrupt sinner with no claim on God at all. If he were to come as a child of Abraham, he
{423}
would be rejected absolutely. It is moral character and conduct that count with God now; on the line of what is good -- on the line of what God is, and Christ is.
Ques. Would the day of wrath belong to the great white throne?
C.A.C. There is wrath to come before the great white throne; it is a day of wrath in contrast to the day of salvation which is now present. Men ought to beware; the next thing is a day of wrath. Things are not going to be improved as men think; the kingdom of God will be introduced by a day of wrath -- God is going to have His way. The wrath of God will prepare the way for the kingdom, not the gospel. Naturally the Jew is under wrath, having rejected the testimony of Christ and of the Spirit. Possibly in a very short time, within the lifetime of many living now, the wrath of God will be revealed. The saints will be delivered from the wrath to come by the rapture; that is the very next event to happen. The wrath to come is after that.
{424}
NOTES OF A READING
@Romans 3: 1 - 20
Ques. What is the superiority of the Jew when all are under sin? How do you reconcile the two?
C.A.C. Paul tells us that the superiority and profit they had lay in the fact that they had communications from God; no other nation had the oracles of God. God had been graciously pleased to put the means of faith amongst them. Everything that faith required as foundation was there in the oracles of God whether man believed them or not. If there were those that did not believe, it did not lessen the value of the oracles for those that did, and I suppose it is so today. The greatest advantage of the christian profession lies in this, that the oracles of God are there; they are not in the heathen world. "The faith of God" is the faith that has God as its object. God had furnished His people with everything, so that His people might have the faith of what God was.
Rem. Stephen says in @Acts 7: 38, "This is he who was in the assembly in the wilderness, with the angel who spoke to him in the mount Sinai, and with our fathers; who received living oracles to give to us".
Rem. Paul says they were entrusted with them. Is that true today in christendom as to the revealed mind of God?
C.A.C. Yes, it is. People do not pay much regard to the oracles of God, because they do not think much of God. Faith would have nothing to go upon if there were no communications from God.
Rem. "Salvation is of the Jews" (@John 4: 22).
C.A.C. So that if they had not faith there was no excuse whatever. There is no excuse whatever if people have the Bible, or if they have only the sun, moon and stars, or only the knowledge of good and evil. But if they have in addition to that the oracles of God, they are indeed without excuse.
{425}
Ques. How do men come into touch with the oracles of God?
C.A.C. I suppose by a sense of their need. The oracles are the communication of the mind of God. I suppose primarily among the Jews it was the Scriptures -- "Ye search the scriptures", the Lord said (@John 5: 39).
Rem. I suppose the point is that whether men believe it or not, or accept it or not, it makes no difference.
C.A.C. Yes, "Let God be true, and every man false", Paul says.
Rem. The reference to @Psalm 51: 4 would show the effect on man when light was there.
C.A.C. David had to learn by experience what he was, that God might be justified. A way was opened up in repentance. These chapters are to shut us up to God. They make very plain that there is no righteousness in man for God, and if God had not righteousness for man, the case would be hopeless, would it not?
The "faith of God" is the faith that leaves man out of account and thinks only of God. The whole Old Testament could be summed up in that; it was only to show that nothing was of any value but what was of God. What the gospel reveals is that there is such a thing as righteousness of God. You get in this chapter the three expressions, "the faith of God", "the faith of Jesus Christ" and the "faith of Jesus". We cannot now have the faith of God without having the faith of Jesus Christ.
Ques. Did the thief on the cross submit to the righteousness of God?
C.A.C. I believe he had a sense that all the value of the One who had done nothing amiss was for him. He felt, what is in this Man is for my benefit. It is not what is in heaven but what comes into this world that is a test -- the presentation of Himself. It is not only the test, but the way of all blessing.
Rem. This epistle brings out what God is in relation to man and His glory.
{426}
C.A.C. That is the great point in it, and that there should be faith in God and in Christ.
Ques. What is the force of "the truth of God" (verse 7)?
C.A.C. Well, I suppose the truth of God was made to appear in man being a sinner. God had borne witness to man that he was a sinner, and God's truth bore witness to it. We have to come to it in our souls that we have not a scrap of righteousness for God. Man's condition as a sinner justified God.
Rem. The end of verse 7 is not very clear to follow, "Why yet am I also judged as a sinner?"
C.A.C. You are to answer the question; he leaves it to every reader to answer. There is only one answer possible, 'Well, because you deserve to be, Paul'! A sinner will be judged because he deserves to be judged. It is made very apparent that what God has been saying for thousands of years is absolutely true, every word of it is true.
Rem. The note says, 'he remained true in spite of my failure (my being a sinner)'. God was misrepresented in the sinner.
C.A.C. If he does not acquire righteousness in some way he will most certainly be judged for he deserves to be judged. Man being such a sinner only proves God has been perfectly right from the beginning in what He said of him.
Rem. The men in @John 8 only considered themselves in accusing the woman. They went out.
C.A.C. They were actually rather a fine set of men because their consciences were active, but it would have been better if instead of going out they had all knelt down and said, 'We are just as bad as she is, if not worse'. It is important to recognise that we belong to this bad stock. It is not what I am personally, personally I have not done some of these things stated here. It is the description of a stock. These things have all come out in Adam's race. In @Mark 7 there is a terrible list of things given which come out of the heart of men. Every human being belongs to the stock that
{427}
has committed these things. All this is to bring out the necessity for the introduction of another kind of Man. It is here the state of man, and when we read it we feel ashamed that we are human beings.
Rem. David felt this.
C.A.C. There was something in David that was the result of new birth; his sin brought to light something that was of God in him. And God is working to bring to light what is in certain men because He has put it there -- something that is quite different from the moral evil and wickedness that belong to this fallen stock.
This righteousness is available for men on the principle of faith in Jesus Christ; it is in another kind of Man altogether from the man that sinned; a Man came in who did no sin, who knew no sin and in whom sin was not. Well, He is the object of faith, man can believe on One that is altogether lovely and perfect, and righteousness of God comes in as connected with another Man and with His death. Not an atom of worthiness is required from man in the flesh, he is utterly unworthy, and the sentence of death has been passed upon him.
Rem. There are five quotations here from the Psalms and one from Isaiah. It is not a mere question of doctrine but of experience.
C.A.C. All these passages come from scriptures where you find God does work in man. There is something alongside of this dreadful nature that is the work of God. These things have never been true of the saints viewed as such; they all have to acknowledge that they were true of them as natural men belonging to Adam.
"But now without law righteousness of God is manifested". It was quite clear in the Scriptures that righteousness did not come in on the line of law, but afterwards. Adam and Eve got righteousness in type and they did nothing at all to merit it; and Abel too, God testifying of his gifts. There was no law to keep; here was an ancient saint
{428}
that was righteous without doing anything for it. So Noah was "heir of the righteousness which is by faith". There is plenty of testimony in the Old Testament that there is such a thing as righteousness provided for man by God, to which the law making nothing perfect could have nothing to say; law gives the knowledge of sin.
You see, righteousness must be a righteousness that comes up to God's estimate of righteousness. If left to men what a poor righteousness it would be! We are all ready to say we fast twice in the week and give tithes of all we possess; it is enough to set us up as men in business for righteousness. The righteousness of God is on the ground of the death of Christ and is a flawless righteousness; it will stand the searching light of the great white throne if necessary. "By faith of Jesus Christ" (verse 22). It is very important that Jesus Christ should be preached -- "The preaching of Jesus Christ", Paul says -- so that men might see what a perfect contrast He is to the children of Adam, so perfectly for God's pleasure. Jesus Christ is that kind of Man, a different order of man entirely from Adam and his race. So that this deals not only with man's sins, but with his state. And he comes down to "the faith of Jesus" (verse 27), which is very beautiful, Jesus Christ being somewhat in His official character as displacing every other man. It is as if to say, Is anyone attracted to the beautiful character of Jesus, to 'Gentle Jesus, meek and mild'? If anyone is attracted to Him so as to believe on Him, God justifies him, God gives him a perfect righteousness.
{429}
THE GOSPEL AS BRINGING TO US THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD
@Romans 3: 21 - 26; @Romans 5: 1 - 11
Ques. Do you suggest that joying in God is the result of the gospel received in the soul?
C.A.C. The more one thinks of the gospel the more wonderful does it become; it confers everything.
The ministry of the gospel is the greatest of all truth. There is ever a need for us to be enlarged and confirmed in the knowledge of God that the gospel brings us. The gospel really brings God to us, and our real stature and stability depend upon our knowledge of God. The gospel includes everything; all the truth of the assembly is included in the gospel. The gospel is a beautiful casket and when you open it you find the truth of the assembly inside -- "This mystery ... as to the assembly". All that Christ is, all that the Spirit is, is bound up with and in the gospel. I have no sympathy with those who say, 'It is only the gospel'. The elements of the gospel, the foundations, are so magnificent, wonderful big stones like those in the temple! Think of it, that God Himself should become the creature's joy; that man should come to find his joy in God, because God has found His joy in man. It is wonderful to think of the good news that has come to us -- God has made every provision for filling us up with divine joy. If we are not filled with joy we are not in the good of the gospel. There is often a lack of joy with believers. One feels that it shows that the gospel is not really in the power of the Spirit in the soul.
Rem. "We are making our boast in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ" (@Romans 5: 11).
Ques. Is the first foundation righteousness?
{430}
C.A.C. God has put His own righteousness in the forefront of the gospel. It is the shining out of what God is, shining out in righteousness. God says, 'You have been unrighteous, you have departed from Me, you are no longer innocent, and you are not righteous, but I am going to show you My righteousness, and give you a perfect absolution from all that presses on your conscience. I am going to lift every burden from you, and show My righteousness in doing it'.
Ques. In chapter 1: 17 we read with regard to the gospel that "Righteousness of God is revealed therein". How?
C.A.C. It is a question of His own movements. God has moved in a wonderful way.
He has provided a suitable Object for the faith of man, "By the faith of Jesus Christ" (@Galatians 2: 16). It does make you love God when you see the kind of Person He has brought in! He has brought in a Man without a flaw; One whom He could anoint. Every poor sinner could say, 'Thank God for that', because it is "towards all". Oh! if people would only read the gospels, they would be obliged to come to the conclusion that "this man has done nothing amiss". God in His own rights has brought Him in -- can anyone give a reason why they could not have faith in Jesus Christ? What a wonderful way God has taken of shutting man's mouth; is He not trustworthy? Is there anything in that Person for which you cannot commit yourself to Him? Nothing.
"The faith of Jesus Christ" is a life-long study! It is not once for all: you begin small in "the faith of Jesus Christ"; as we go on, we are learning more and more the confidence that can be reposed in that blessed Man, and in doing so you are drawing near to God. Would that not make anybody happy? It makes one's heart bound. The enemy would darken all the light that God has brought in. Adam is a complete ruin and is untrustworthy. God's righteousness is made known in the bringing in of the Man of His pleasure. God is teaching us to believe in Jesus Christ. You can throw the whole weight of
{431}
your soul and your affections on that Person, and when you do, you are happy and getting the good of the gospel.
It is not God who has told us that He is love; God has left us to work out for ourselves that He is love. It is John who says, "God is love" (@1 John 4: 16). It is left to us to say it. Faith arrives at that conclusion. The way that He has brought in His righteousness is so convincing that you cannot get away from the conclusion that "God is love". You are convinced of it -- God's love is the only thing in which God is not sufficient for Himself -- love must have objects. The love of God comes to light in this: we find there is that in God that, for His own satisfaction, He must be possessed of me; we are a necessity to God. It is not only that I need God (which is the first thing I learn) for perfect absolution -- a Saviour God, a Justifier, a Deliverer -- but behind that, God needs man; that is why redemption has come in. God's first thoughts will be His ultimate thoughts; what He begins with He will finish with; He is "the Alpha and the Omega".
Firstly, there is "the faith of Jesus Christ" -- the faith of a Man so delightful to God that He can anoint Him -- and secondly, we are "justified freely by his grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus". That gives us a wonderful idea of the kind of recovery that God has brought about. Redemption involves the recovery of what is lost; redemption brought about by a glorified Man, and in a glorified Man, "in Christ Jesus". We do not understand the death of Christ or the blood of Christ except in the light of the glorified Christ.
What is redemption? The redemption that God has brought in is in a glorified Man. He was once in death, under judgment, made sin, delivered for offences, but now He is out of it all, completely clear of death and Satan's power, and radiant in glory. He is there as a Man, the anointed Man in heaven. Redemption is in a glorified Man and if God puts the value of that on a person, that one would be justified. As believers, God has actually invested us with the worth of the
{432}
glorified Man. "Freely", the same word as that translated "without a cause" in "They hated me without a cause" (@John 15: 25). It is the uncaused, undesired action of a Saviour God. Can any question be raised? The sunshine of this would settle all the fears and misgivings that some believers have.
Thirdly, it is, "Whom God has set forth a mercy-seat, through faith in his blood" (@Romans 3: 25). You can think about the blood now, if you like; we see the character of redemption, God's way of bringing man into His presence in conditions of glory, set before us in Christ Jesus. It is there -- that is, the measure and character of it -- and when we have understood that, we can learn the value of the blood, learn it in the light of the glory. No other light is great enough to show you the value of the blood. There are many types of the blood in the Old Testament, the blood on the door-posts and lintel which is very blessed, and the blood in the other types, all most precious and efficacious, but on the mercy-seat the Shekinah glory, God's presence, shone on the gold and on the blood. It is a wonderful thing to have faith in the blood on the mercy-seat. It is before God's eye as that which sets Him perfectly free to come out, (it is not shelter for the poor sinner) and to set forth the glorified Man. God comes out in all the value of the death of that glorified Person who is now in heaven. It is the light of that that shines upon the death of Jesus. The fulness of the Godhead dwelt in Jesus on earth. You pity a person who has not the light and joy of it -- God has cleared us for the satisfaction of His own heart and given us to see the death of Christ in the light of the glory.
How delightful it is to God when He sees a soul seeing Him setting forth Jesus as a mercy-seat. The Shekinah glory shining on that and the blood on it. There is nothing so wonderful as that, if I have taken in the fact that Jesus has been down into death for me. It is the way that God has set Himself free so that we know Him in the blessed movements of His love, the motive nature of His love. His moral nature
{433}
is righteousness, holiness, etc.; His motive nature is love. God has acted that we should know Him in His motive nature. It is His love that moves Him; He moves at the dictates of His love, consistently with His moral nature. The gospel is worthy of God, and when you have said that, you have said everything.
Rem. In chapter 1, it is spoken of as, "God's glad tidings", and in @1 Thessalonians 2: 13, "The word of the report of God".
C.A.C. What God is! And it is all available for the vilest sinner because "there is no difference". I address everybody on a common platform in preaching the gospel for no one knows the gospel fully, not even the preacher. Divine joy in the heart, the light of the blessedness of God, is ours by the gospel. God's great object in the new covenant, the conditions He establishes from His own side, is to be God to us. He says, "I will be to them God". God is known in all the movings of His heart so that thus He may get His desire, "They shall be to me a people" (@2 Corinthians 6: 16). The gospel is universal; it finds everybody in the same state and brings everybody into the same blessedness. @Romans 3 is one of the most comforting chapters in the Bible -- God knew the worst about me before He started. Redemption is in Christ Jesus, and He is the mercy-seat; all stands on that footing, it is Christ.
Ques. What is meant in @1 John 4: 17 -- "As he is, we also are in this world"?
C.A.C. If we really receive the gospel, we are brought on to the ground that what is true of Christ is true of us. Is Jesus Christ the righteous? Then believers are righteous. He is the holy One, believers are holy -- the believer takes character from Him.
Chapter 5 is our side, what we have. God has raised up Jesus our Lord for our justification, that is how we know God. He Himself is our righteousness. J.N.D. said a short time before he died, 'Christ is my righteousness and that
{434}
settles everything'. There is cloudless peace then! We come into God's favour, we have access into it.
We have "peace", "access", "boast in hope of the glory of God" and "boast in tribulations", because in them we are getting the experience of God. The gospel gives you light but not experience. Light is greater than experience; you can learn more by light than by ten thousand years of experience. God has left us here in conditions of tribulation, and in every tribulation there is an opportunity for experience of God. In the tribulations you get the experience of God, and you can boast in them because you experience what God can be in such circumstances.
You know what to expect from God because His love (the same as that expressed in the death of Christ) is diffused in your heart by the Spirit. You will never experience anything of God inconsistent with the light of the gospel.
Finally, "being enemies, we have been reconciled to God through the death of his Son" (verse 10). It is when we were enemies -- reconciliation touches a deeper question than guilt. A man might have sinned without being at enmity. A disobedient child does not naturally hate his parents, but with man there is a rebellious will, and reconciliation comes in in connection with that. God has dealt with it in His love in the death of His Son. The One who loved God perfectly has borne the judgment of that. Every person who has the faith of that is reconciled. It is then that we begin true self-judgment. God has retained us for His own pleasure, apart from all that at such a cost; then how can I go on with it? One learns to judge one's own will in the light of being retained for God's complacency, for His pleasure.
The gospel is a fine thing; I do not feel ashamed of it.
{435}
FROM C.A.C.¬S NOTES
@Romans 3: 21
Paul must have thought of what he was himself in writing @Romans 2: 17 - 20. But he had to find that he was transgressing the law all the time. Here it is not quite a question of the spirituality of the law but of its actual precepts: he does show here that the outward is not sufficient. One must be right inwardly. The law required what was inward in the last commandment. It is only as having Christ and the Spirit that we can be circumcised in heart and spirit. The natural man can follow the letter of things but he cannot touch the spirit. God is occupied with the inward. Outwardly we may take on the colour of our surroundings. A woman broke bread for years but said she had never been in fellowship. Are we inwardly in what we profess? This requires faith in exercise all the time and walking in the Spirit.
The Jew has a great advantage outwardly and first indeed in having the oracles of God. They put us in direct contact with the source of faith. All that faith requires for its foundation is there. The faith of God is the faith that has God as Object and it is ever the result of new birth. God's righteousness in chapter 3: 5 is that He has said what was true about man.
Righteousness of God is by faith of Jesus Christ. It is by the coming in of One wholly of God and without sin so that by faith in Him we may acquire the gain of what is in another Man. It is not setting up the man of the previous verses but the heart giving place by faith to God's Man. So that righteousness of God is towards all but it is towards all by faith of Jesus Christ. A perfect righteousness and wholly of God, it comes in to be upon all those who believe. All may have it, but only by faith of Jesus Christ. This is the way in which righteousness of God becomes available for all men. It is by
{436}
one Man. The whole race of mankind has been shown to have no righteousness, but righteousness of God comes in by the faith of another Man. Every other has sinned and come short of the glory of God. But this Man did not come short. It is in connection with the perfection of Christ that righteousness of God comes in. What is put upon the believer is according to God's estimate of righteousness -- what is wholly of Himself. Faith gets it.
Being justified freely by His grace: the believer can be divinely cleared of all charge without the slightest worthiness on his part -- freely by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus. The whole power and value of what brings it about is redemption, and this wholly of God in Christ Jesus. Redemption is in the Man of God's purpose.
God has set Him forth on His own part as a Mercy-seat in His blood. The value of it extended back to all the Old Testament believers. And it extends to all New Testament believers also in a fuller way for they are justified and know it. And the righteousness they have is solely of God. It is entirely in the value of Christ and His death so that it can be said that they are justified in Christ (@Galatians 2: 17).
The whole state of man as under sin is brought out in @Romans 1 - 3. It is evident that it is no use to make a demand on him for righteousness or to answer to the glory of God. If the state of things is to be met God must undertake everything Himself. Sin having come in it must be displaced by righteousness, and this brought in by God Himself. The whole of Scripture shows that God was the only One who could act in the presence of sin and death so that His own glory might be met and His creature set up in a way that was suitable to Himself. What God would be for His creature came out in promise before, but now it has come out in a wonderful way in Jesus Christ. If men have the faith of Jesus Christ the Son of God they see how God has undertaken everything. A divine Person in manhood who shows what was in God for man. And it is for everybody; God is great
{437}
enough to be known as supplying all that is needed by every human being. The provision of righteousness means the undoing of the works of the devil. All are alike in sinning and coming short; all may be alike in being invested with divine righteousness. This provision of divine righteousness means that those who get it are justified. They are righteously cleared before God of all that attached to them as members of a sinful race. God is set before us in the glad tidings as One who blots out fully and in perfect grace the whole dark history set forth in @Romans 1 - 3. To be justified means that God has absolutely nothing against the believer. It is in God's mind that things shall be on this footing through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus. Such is the saving grace of God and such is the value of redemption that every believer is as free from every charge of sin as if he had never been a sinful creature. Christ Jesus is a dignified title of our precious Saviour! It speaks of Him as anointed to do a greater work than creation. The Creator has become the Redeemer and redemption is in all the infinite value and glory of His person. He is set forth on God's part as a Mercy-seat in the value of His blood. God is willing to justify at His own cost and to provide for His own glory at the same time (see @Leviticus 16). There has been consuming judgment outside the camp. At what a cost God has secured to Himself the right to justify! The mercy-seat has the blood upon it -- the witness of death. God has been glorified by the sentence of death coming upon One who came under it in grace and obedience. God's glory in grace to the sinful creature has been brought out in a superlative way. And it is for faith to lay hold of it. And that shows how God was acting in righteousness when He passed by the sins of Old Testament believers. We see His righteousness in the present time also. But justification is not the setting up of the sinful man again, but the putting the believer in the presence of God entirely on the ground of Christ and His death. To put one spot back upon the believer would be to rob God of His glory as the
{438}
Justifier, and to rob Christ of the glory of redemption. The whole matter is covered by the law of faith. We see by faith that it is the pleasure of God to justify. It is the putting of His creature before Him completely free from the stain and reproach of sin and really in Christ (@Galatians 2: 17). The righteousness of God is seen in putting believers before Himself absolutely free from all charge, as invested with all that He has brought in in Christ. God has done it all. The righteousness of God is a greater thing than any human righteousness could be, however perfect. Christ raised again for our justification shows that justification gives us the status with God of Christ risen. Indeed He is our righteousness -- we are set up quite apart from any righteousness that could be ours as living in this world. Faith is rightly prominent as being a divine principle in the soul of man.
God reckons righteousness to the one who has faith (@Romans 4: 6, 11). It is free grace acting on the ground of redemption: Christ in the value of His blood is the sacrificial basis of it, but faith is the principle on which it comes to the soul. A divine principle is brought into the soul of man -- the man becomes marked by receiving a report that comes from God. There is a moral foundation in the man which is of God. Now God provides that where there is this foundation righteousness shall be, so to speak, attached to it, and that this shall be made known so as to be the known principle on which we are with God. The whole state of the fallen man has been dealt with in the death of Christ as well as the sins that accrue out of that state. Death was upon man and this could only be set aside by resurrection power. That power has acted for man in the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. So that resurrection enters into our justification. We are just as helpless in this matter of justification as if we were actually dead but God has raised our Lord Jesus Christ from among the dead.
A question was raised as to the difference between forgiveness and justification. "God was in Christ, reconciling ..., not reckoning to them their offences". Now forgiveness is
{439}
preached so that man may be encouraged to turn to God. He is in the attitude of forgiveness and peace known through Christ and through His death. Peter calls upon the men at Jerusalem to be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins. But we must go to Paul to learn about justification and having faith reckoned as righteousness. Justification and having faith reckoned as righteousness belong to Paul's gospel. It was through faith, not through works, that Abraham was righteous. Now God justifies the ungodly, and He is to be believed on in that character, and the one who does has his faith reckoned to him as righteousness. David declares the blessedness of the man to whom God reckons righteousness without works, and we learn from this that the forgiven man has his faith reckoned to him as righteousness. Righteousness is reckoned to all them that believe. If it is faith the matter is altogether of God; He sets us up in a subsisting righteousness according to grace; He would make sure that all that He has in mind -- the promise -- shall be brought to pass. We find a seed here who is to be brought into all that God has before Him for men. He then brings into view God's quickening power and His giving a name to what had not existed before. Now the heavenly seed has come in on the principle of resurrection power. Now we believe on God as the One who has raised our Lord Jesus from among the dead. Our justification is connected with resurrection and it is therefore not for this world but for God's world.
If God reckons righteousness to a man in virtue of faith it is for evermore (@Psalm 106: 31). The righteousness that is reckoned must be according to what the man believes. If God reckons righteousness to a man it is according to His own thought of righteousness. That is, it is in perfect contrast to the whole state of man as under sin. There is substance in it. For God is known as having adjusted the whole matter perfectly. And this even for the ungodly. What is God's grace? What is redemption's worth? What is the free gift of
{440}
righteousness? 'The state of accomplished subsisting righteousness before God, in which justification places us' (see note k to @Romans 5: 16).
Five times the promise is referred to in the latter part of @Romans 4. The promise is what God has set before faith, for us, that we should come into all the wealth of the new Head, leading up to eternal life.
Righteousness means that all the disorder brought in by sin has been adjusted to God's satisfaction. Is it not mainly the righteousness of God in chapter 3 and the righteousness of faith in chapter 4? Down to the end of chapter 4 the truth of the glad tidings is stated in a general way. There is no personal appropriation. But when God is believed on as the Raiser up of the Lord Jesus, that faith is reckoned as righteousness and there is appropriation. Having been justified on the principle of faith clearly shows that there has been appropriation, for it is said, "We have peace towards God". So that there is no known justification until God is known and believed on as the Raiser up of Jesus our Lord. Many are attracted to the blessed Person presented in the gospels and have joy in thinking of Him in His wondrous grace, and many value His death as the only ground of forgiveness and blessing, but they can hardly be said to be justified by faith. They are not set by faith in a state of accomplished subsisting righteousness before God. So that it has been said that we do not believe on His death apart from His resurrection. Until God comes before the soul as the Object of confidence as raising up the Lord Jesus there can hardly be said to be justification by faith. A man may be justified in the sight of God long before he can appropriate chapter 5: 1. It may sound strange, but it is true, that generally we have to learn the gospel after we are converted. There was no one in the state of a risen man for the eternal pleasure of God until Jesus our Lord was raised, but He was put in that position for our justification. Our sins were upon Him vicariously on the cross, but that they are all gone does not quite give the divine
{441}
measure of the justification. We must see God putting His blessed Son in a position where no sins or sin could ever be imputed to Him again for all eternity. Now we confide in God as the One who has raised Him because His mind was to have us as clear before Him as the risen Christ. We have to learn all this from Paul. Peter will not tell us, nor even John. We must come to the apostle of the Gentiles.
Then our Lord Jesus Christ is seen as the great Administrator in the kingdom of God. He brings to us all that God is in blessing for us, and it comes through the risen and glorified Man. It is God's favour into which the justified enter, and they obtain and possess it. This enters into all our relations with God. We stand in it; it is a fixed position. And it is by faith and we boast in hope of the glory of God. The more the glory shines out the happier it is for us. The time is drawing near when there will not be one bit of the glory of man to be seen.
But then it brings in what might seem to be a strange thing. We boast in tribulations also. Tribulations compel us to bring God in in a proved way, and that tests as to what value we really put upon God. Moses persevered as seeing Him who is invisible. The more we prove God the more hopeful we are, because we know that what He has been in the past He will be in the future. And hope in God will never let us down, for the Holy Spirit has been given to us to shed abroad the love of God in our hearts. If we take the steps up to this point we shall not fail to prove this. But if we try to follow a crooked path we shall find there is an obstruction. The Holy Spirit will not take the crook out. We must do that. How He sheds the love of God abroad is by bringing the death of Christ before us. This is not for sinners to hear but for saints.
It is well that we should understand the difference between justification and reconciliation and particularly in the way in which they work out in our souls. Justification leaves me clear in conscience so that I have peace towards God through our Lord Jesus Christ. But the effect of reconciliation is to
{442}
bring me near. Justification is how I stand righteously before God in a state of accomplished subsisting righteousness of which Christ is the expression. But it does not in itself suggest nearness. Nearness comes in in relation to moral distance. Enemies are persons in moral distance. If two persons need to be reconciled it shows that distance has come in between them. How great was the distance that sin brought in between man and God! It is not only that I have committed sins but my whole state is one of distance from God.
Indeed it is the distance of death. Now God has removed the distance in the death of His Son. We get the thought of a divine righteousness brought in in the coats of skin but not that of nearness to God. But in Abel, I think we may say there is a certain hint of nearness, followed up by Enoch and Noah walking with God. Now it seems to me that reconciliation underlies this. I do not say it was brought out then but we can look at it now in the light of what has come out since.
The death of His Son seems to bring out in a remarkable way how God's affections enter into this. At all cost to His own love He would remove the distance and it was really by removing the man who was the enemy. We were naturally enemies. What hard thoughts of God; what rebellion; what infidelity! The prodigal illustrates distance, but the moment he returned to God in mind he found that the father removed the distance. The Son of God came into the distance that we are in and removed it so that when the prodigal wanted nearness he found no obstacle in the way. The same gospel that tells us we are justified tells us that we are reconciled. But we have to receive it by our Lord Jesus Christ.
Now we can understand why the saints boast in God. He has undertaken to remove the distance to His own satisfaction that we might be near to Him in the joy of what He has brought to pass. The Lord Jesus Christ is the Administrator of all that is in the heart of God for us. He brings it all out in the fullest possible way. The Lord's table and His supper are in His administration of love. They present His death in view
{443}
of nearness. If we are in the fellowship of His death we will part from the man of distance. And the Lord Jesus Christ comes before us as ministering to us all that is in Himself of what God is in His wondrous thoughts to usward. So that the Supper and what follows it ministers to the thought of nearness. We move with Christ into the great thoughts of God which are set forth in Him. In a word, we come to Christ as Head. All the teaching of Romans from chapter 3 to chapter 5: 11 is leading us to the apprehension of an order of things which all flows out of the relation in which Christ stands as Head. His place is emphasised in contrast with the first man.
The Spirit of God is leading us in @Romans 5: 12, etc., to see how much can come in by one man. The whole history of the world sets it forth. God has given everybody the opportunity to see it for themselves. Adam is thus one of the greatest types of Christ in the Old Testament; a figure of Him to come. Death reigned from Adam to Moses, even when there was no law to break. Now if so much resulted from the act of one man it ought to touch us to think of how much came by another one Man. If God is pleased to perform a great act of favour will it not be suitable that the results shall correspond with the results of the offence? The act of favour is the bringing in of a new Head. No one can deny that he has been affected by headship. Every man has come under sin and death by having a false head. The most important question that can be raised is, is there another head? If there is it is by an act of favour on God's part. The grace of God and the free gift in grace is by the one Man, Jesus Christ. Now it is for everyone to enquire what has come by that one Man. The grace of God will never be understood until it is seen as coming by the one Man. He was full of grace and truth. Mercy is great in the need that it meets, but grace is great in the thought of the One who exercises it. Those who were conscious that they were under sin and death met with nothing but grace in Jesus. He declared God from the bosom of the Father. The Father is the name of grace; He judges no
{444}
man. Then the free gift in grace is, as I see it, His righteousness. As justified we are set up in righteousness before God. Any man can be justified by coming to the knowledge of God in grace. God's great act of favour is that if we have many offences there is justification for us through Christ (see note k to chapter 5: 16). The abundance of grace and of the free gift of righteousness -- everyone who really sees the abundance of grace in Christ receives it. The god of this world blinds men's eyes so that the light should not shine forth for them. Those who do receive reign in life by the One, Jesus Christ. That involves deliverance. The one righteousness comes in here as towards all men. That is the great act of righteousness upon the cross; sins were judged there; sin in the flesh was condemned; the penalty of death borne. God was glorified in the highest possible way. This is for the benefit of all men, but those who come into the benefit have justification of life. They live soberly, righteously and piously in the present course of things.
As to verse 19, it does not say by one obedience, but by the obedience of the One, thus leaving room for the whole precious obedience of Christ to have its part and place. That is, our link with Christ is surely to be as real as our link with Adam. We were naturally linked with Adam but we are spiritually linked with Christ. And such are constituted righteous. It is utterly foreign to a believer to steal or defraud or tell a lie. Indeed he is marked by love which fulfils the law. Grace has overabounded so that it might reign through righteousness to eternal life. It is really the blessing of the gospel enjoyed under the reign of grace. As we know, it is in Christ Jesus our Lord. It is in that Person.
One offence had its bearing towards all men to condemnation, but now there is one righteousness which has its bearing towards all men to justification of life. God would call the attention of all men to that one act of righteousness. It is the precious work of Christ looked at in its universal bearing; the one righteousness -- the dealing with all that the first man
{445}
brought in, in a perfectly righteous way to the glory of God, so that men may come into the value of it and may begin to live as completely detached from their former life of sin. Those who take in the meaning of the one righteousness do not go on with what was condemned in it. They take sides with God in accepting the rightness of what was done at the cross. They come into line with it and they do not go on sinning. The following chapters open this out. They bring out what justification of life really is. The one righteousness was accomplished altogether outside of us but it was accomplished that a certain effect might be produced in us. It is a fact that those who are affected by the one righteousness do not go on as sinning. There is justification in a practical sense -- that is of life. This is the result seen as it is worked out; the thing in view. The effect of the one righteousness is to lead men to judge what has been judged there. And if I judge a thing I do not go on with it. We begin to measure everything by the standard of the cross. If I judge everything that was judged at the cross I shall be in justification of life.
Then the obedience of One is the converse to this. That is, we see in the obedience of Christ the perfect answer to the will of God in a positive way. It takes in His whole life from the manger to the cross. That element of obedience enters into the whole fibre of the believer's life. He is constituted righteous. And grace reigns through righteousness to eternal life. The elements that hindered entrance into eternal life are eliminated.
Now we can see how it is assumed that believers have died to sin. It is that principle which has come into the world by one man, an all-pervading principle. We have only got out of it through the death of Christ. It is not only to Christ that we have been baptised but to His death. As to the whole character of our old life we are buried by baptism unto death. Something of the radiance of the Father's glory is to be seen as the believer walks in newness of life. Jesus is seen here as the Pattern; in chapter 5 He is the last Adam. A baptised
{446}
man is inconsistent if he walks in the life of the old man. We are justified from sin as having died with Christ. We are coming out in the likeness of His resurrection; now that is to be so morally at the present time. If we are not identified with Christ in death we have no blessing at all.
Christ was great enough to bring everything that had come in by Adam before God for judgment, but this is the way of grace to men that men might be morally adjusted and recovered for God. And this through the acceptance of a divinely appointed Head.
We have seen what a glorious Head has been divinely provided by God's act of favour and that the faith of Him and of what has accrued through Him results in believers reigning in life and having justification of life and being constituted righteous. It is easy to see that this involves complete severance from the evil principle that came in by Adam; a severance so complete that death is the only adequate expression of it. So that the relation of the believer to sin is that he is dead to it; and this was brought before us in a striking way in our baptism. We were baptised to death, even to the death of Christ. Those who baptised us knew that the only right ground for the children of Adam to be on is that of identification with Christ in death. The man identified with the principle of evil must come under death, but the wonderful thing is that that is now set forth in the way of grace, for Christ has been into death. The judgment of the disobedient man has been borne by the obedient Man that the disobedient man might disappear, and that we might walk in newness of life so that our practical life might be of a new order morally. "Knowing ... that our old man has been crucified with him" (@Romans 6: 6), so that all that expresses the will of the fallen man might be ended "that we should no longer serve sin. For he that has died is justified from sin"; he can no longer be charged with sin when he is dead.
We are only baptised once. We come on to the ground of Christ and His death and there is no going back, any more
{447}
than the Israelites could go back over the Red Sea. We are buried with Him and we do not come back again in the old character of life at all. What a precious thing to know this -- to obey it from the heart! If we obey from the heart it is evident that we have come under the new Head in our affections. So that the newness of life is that we now walk in relation to Christ; the word 'with' occurs five times in @Romans 6: 4 - 8. His death was necessary to sever our link with the old life; we should have no title to break away from our old head if Christ had not died, so that our identification with His death is our liberation from that link. Our old man was the man linked with Adam, and he was crucified with Christ. This is so that the whole body of sin might be annulled, not merely certain members annulled, but the whole body, that is the whole man displaced by another Man. It is not correcting details but the whole body annulled so that we do not serve that principle any more. It is only as having died with Christ that we are justified from sin. I have to obey this from the heart. This is not experience but divine instruction. As having died with Christ we shall also live with Him; this reaches on to all the future. Christ does not go back to His life in flesh, holy as it was. He is now for ever beyond death. From chapter 6: 12 it is the believer practically.
Believers as having obeyed from the heart the form of teaching into which they were instructed have obtained freedom from sin. As having come under the new Head they have received abundance of grace and of the free gift of righteousness; they are under grace; they have changed their headship. They are free and they have power; not exactly here the power of the Spirit but the power of the new system of grace as brought in in the new Head. So that now the believer is in control of his mortal body. It is not exactly here what the Spirit does but what the believer does. He is not to let sin reign. There are lusts connected with the mortal body but if we obey them we are not reigning in life. Our members are viewed here as instruments of which we have charge.
{448}
They were formerly instruments of unrighteousness for, indeed, we were free from righteousness. Our whole life was a doing of our own will; it was bondage to the principle that came in by Adam. But we are entitled to be free from that principle as being dead with Christ so that we may yield ourselves to God as alive out of death. We are to understand that we have come out of death as under the grace of our new Head. As knowing the grace of God in the new Head I may live out of my previous state of death and as having been instructed in the form of teaching. We are now to live as in relation to the new Head and we yield ourselves to God as living in a way that He can take account of as being alive. Now the members are to be instruments of righteousness to God. It is most blessed to think of God having a people really alive to Him and whose members are actively serviceable to righteousness for His pleasure. It shows the power of the new economy.
But then this must be a practical thing. We are bondmen either of sin or of obedience, but through God's grace we have moved in our affections into obedience. This act of yielding is a definite act on the part of the believer. He is now found as superior to the power of sin; he has come out of the surrounding death as alive and is now to be yielded to God as free from sin. The prodigal was alive when he came to the father's house. It is not exactly the power of the Spirit here but what the believer is constitutionally as under grace in the new Head. It is possible to yield our members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but this is never to be done by the believer. We are to yield ourselves as a once accomplished act to God. It is due to His grace that He should have us, and not only are our members to be instruments of righteousness, but they are to be so to God. We are now bondmen to the principle of obedience, and nothing is right that is not the outcome of obedience. We have become bondmen to righteousness as in contrast with sin. It is bondage as being a condition from which there is no escape, and it is entered
{449}
upon by a conscious act of yielding. Being bondmen to God is a great privilege. We have our fruit unto holiness and the end eternal life. Yielding to God is a movement of life -- it is a great delight to God. We live on the principle of faith in chapter 1; that is how we live objectively by what we know of God in His revealed grace, but now we live out of death for God's pleasure. There is life there with great potentialities, for it is evidenced by yielding ourselves to God. There is a sense of His pleasure in us morally for our members are instruments of righteousness to God. It is His own work coming to light in a practical way. The first use of our members to please God is an indispensable thing in conversion. "Behold, he is praying" (@Acts 9: 11).
We are under the domination of grace. Believers are a new race morally, marked by obedience. One act of lawlessness leads to another, but every act of righteousness leads in the direction of holiness. That is a state of heart that repels what is evil by its own purity.
{450}
NOTES OF A READING
@Romans 3: 21 - 31
C.A.C. I suppose it is the state of all men as "being all under sin" that makes it necessary for righteousness to come in on God's part. I suppose coming under righteousness is the contrast to being under sin.
Ques. In chapter 1: 17 we get that righteousness revealed; here it is manifested. Is there any distinction?
C.A.C. "Manifested" seems to be rather a stronger word, calling our attention particularly to what is consequent upon the coming in of Christ.
Ques. Is it a different kind of righteousness from what would suggest itself to the human mind?
C.A.C. I suppose it is a kind of righteousness that would commend itself to any right-feeling, right-minded man. It is obvious that nothing would be gained by making a demand on the man described in chapters 1 and 3; by no means could he be brought to correspond with God's thought; the case is hopeless.
Rem. It is "borne witness to by the law and the prophets", it says. It is remarkable at this juncture.
C.A.C. I think the whole of Scripture made it appear that if there was to be anything brought in that was good, it must come in entirely from God's side, and as coming in from God, as entirely of Himself, entirely perfect. The whole testimony of Scripture is in that direction.
Rem. In @Psalm 51: 14, David says, "My tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness".
C.A.C. It is good for us all to be reminded that we start with absolute perfection. We begin with a righteousness that is absolute perfection. So that the righteousness with which the believer is invested, which we are told is "upon all those who believe", cannot be improved upon.
{451}
Rem. It is a righteousness for man provided by God, not exactly characteristic of God's acting.
Rem. The "showing forth" of this righteousness, which we get a little lower down, would be a little different thought.
C.A.C. Yes, I think he moves on to show how in its application to us divine righteousness involves justification.
Rem. Righteousness is provided without any violation of God's holy attributes.
C.A.C. It is the foundation really of our relations with God. Many believers go through life in uncertainty as to their relations with Him, but if God is known as providing righteousness and as justifying, well, the soul is set in perfect peace.
God is showing the value of what came in in Christ and the value of redemption as in Him and through His death. It extended backward as the ground by which God was righteous in passing by the sins of Old Testament believers because He had in mind all that would be brought about through the coming in of Christ and by His death; all was present to the mind of God, and He has been pleased to justify Himself in showing us He passed by the sins of Old Testament saints because of it.
Rem. This is the antitype of @Leviticus 16.
Ques. Is justification regarded in reference to God as righteousness is, "That he should be just, and justify him that is of the faith of Jesus"?
C.A.C. God has in view not only the sins and transgressions of man, but his whole state before Him. It is important that God is showing us that what is in His mind will take us completely off the ground of what we were as of the race of Adam and put us on the ground of Christ and His death; so in result Christ becomes our righteousness. God's glory and His rights in respect of His creature are involved in it and He will establish them, whatever Satan or His creatures may do, by bringing in in the way of grace a perfect divine righteousness.
{452}
Ques. Why is forgiveness only mentioned in a quotation in Romans?
C.A.C. I suppose the thought is to show us the kind of status we have with God. Forgiveness is on a different line; it is in the heart of the One offended against.
Rem. So that "upon all those who believe" is status.
C.A.C. Yes, we have this entirely new status, and it is a fixed matter, it does not depend on our fluctuating emotions or experiences. We know God as the Justifier. It is His pleasure to be known in that character and to bring it out through Christ; to relieve us of our past sinful history and to set us for ever before Him in the blessedness of Christ. God has taken on that character. It is not that there is a moment in my history when I am justified, but a moment in my history when I come into the light of God as Justifier; but that is what He is for all men.
God has lost His creature through the fall, of whom He said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness", and He might have left it at that, but He would not. So at first He produced faith in the hearts of Adam and Eve and then clothed them. He brought in what was entirely of Himself; He set them up in an unquestionable status with Him; they could no longer feel naked with Him. So there was nothing left to do but to give thanks and to praise.
It is "by faith of Jesus Christ" that we see how wonderfully God has undertaken for His creature. To see in a divine Person coming in manhood, showing in every step He took how He was prepared to undertake everything for poor man on God's part -- a sense of that sets us up in a wonderful way.
Every human being has a sense of God being the Source of good, and when he prays he testifies to it. And God says, 'It is so, and I will provide you with righteousness at My own cost, it is the first thing you need'. The mercy-seat shows how God has considered for His glory in the question of sin. The testimony to Israel is the sin-offering consumed outside the camp, and the blood on the golden mercy-seat, and now it is
{453}
not shut up in the holiest but "set forth" on God's part. It is God's matter, so when we preach, it is a setting forth of how things are in God's mind; He is the Justifier of every human being. The cherubim's faces turned inwards and downwards, they looked on the blood. What a vindication of the glory of God! The great vindication of God is the death of Christ and His forsaking and what answers to the burning outside the camp. God's glory is in the matter, in His being known in this character. "Whom God has set forth", and it is on His own behalf. He wants to be known in the exceeding freedom of His grace, and His thoughts to be known in regard to His fallen creature, that he should be freed from every charge and stain and covered with divine righteousness, so that there is nothing left but what speaks of Christ and His death. I think it is fine.
Christ Jesus is set forth in the gospel. It is meant to set forth Christ Jesus. It is a title of great dignity; first what He is in reference to the work of creation and now in redemption; and its stands in all the value of His wondrous work and His Person -- and that is how redemption is known and, we might say, experienced.
We begin with faith and it matures into confidence. In learning how God has provided this is a powerful incentive to confidence in God. Confidence is a thing that grows. A righteousness has been established that is more than adequate to clothe the whole human family in a way suitable to God. What seems to shine out in this is the cost at which God has secured before the universe His title to be Justifier. So now for a believer to have any question as to status is robbing God of glory as Justifier and Christ of glory as Redeemer. If there is a spot against him it is a terrible dishonour to God who has done everything that he might be set in the blessedness of Christ before Him.
Christ is the mercy-seat in the power of His blood, and faith apprehends it. Mr. Raven said it probably should read, a mercy-seat in His blood through faith. That is, the mercy-
{454}
seat is in His blood -- it stands in all the value of His blood, and faith gets the light of it and gives God the glory.
Rem. Faith in the Person gives the value to the blood.
C.A.C. That is just it. It is that wonderful Person coming in on God's part and undertaking everything on man's part, so that everything is secured for God. God has rights over His creature to be exercised in redemption. It is in this way we get the knowledge of God. It is not that I believe that I am justified, as some think, but I come to the knowledge of God as Justifier. So this righteousness is "towards all", you cannot possibly limit it; but "upon all those who believe", they are invested with it. "The faith of Jesus" -- it is brought down to the lowest capacity -- a child of two years may have the faith of Jesus.
Rem. In @Acts 13: 39, "in him every one that believes is justified" -- justified in Christ.
C.A.C. It does not mean that the broken-down sinner is merely set up again, but set up again in another Man. So we get in @Galatians 2: 17, "justified in Christ", and in our next chapter, "who ... has been raised for our justification"; that is, it is that blessed One raised from the dead who is the measure of and sets forth the character of it. It is in One risen from the dead, so that we could not be justified as on the earth. The death of Christ cleared the ground, it was the end in God's eye of man after the flesh. "One died for all, then all have died", but Christ risen is the beginning of a new order of things which sin and death can never touch. It is made very clear that faith is what gives us a link with it. God is very pleased with those that have faith in Him and in Christ Jesus and in Jesus.
Ques. Would you explain why justification is not attached to us as living in this world?
C.A.C. In Corinthians it says, "Of him are *ye* in Christ Jesus, who has been made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and holiness, and redemption; that according as it is written, He that boasts, let him boast in the Lord". That is,
{455}
you glory in God, He has done it all. The only ground I can take before men is as a repentant sinner. I have no thought of any other person but Christ, or of any other work but His death, He has covered the throne of God with redemption glory.
Every word of grace He uttered and every miracle He did when here was based on His death. He was going into death, He could not have done one thing otherwise. Now He is living. I have often thought the evangelists as they wrote the gospels would say at the end of every verse, 'And now He is glorified in heaven'.
Wherever there is appreciation of Christ, God is free to take up this character. It may only be a handful of meal. If I come to God to say anything about Jesus, how pleased He is. Not many of us here present have much appreciation, have we? I know I have not, but I pray I may have more appreciation of Him. Being on our side, it comes to us on the principle of faith.
Ques. The thief on the cross would be an example?
C.A.C. I have thought so. He had perfect confidence in asking to be remembered in the kingdom. He was not afraid to. He learnt so much, with nothing but the smallest opportunity. He was as suitable to be in paradise as Jesus; he could not be with Him without it, but his suitability was all provided by God.
These things are progressive with us. We do not arrive at the faith of Jesus at once or of Jesus Christ the anointed One. I hope we are more characterised by the faith of Jesus Christ today than we were ten years ago. The apostle strikingly illustrates it when he says, "that I may be found in him, not having my righteousness, which would be on the principle of law, but that which is by faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God through faith" (@Philippians 3: 9). He is looking for a fuller and deeper knowledge of what we are speaking of tonight at the end of his course. You know very well when you are on this course that you are very pleasing to God, you
{456}
do not belong to that race morally, spoken of in chapters 1 and 3, but have an appreciation of God's anointed Man. You are not of Adam's race now, but of that race of which Christ is the Firstborn.
Rem. The name of Jesus stands alone.
C.A.C. It is the nearest approach to His personal name; in other titles He wears an official glory. In @Ephesians 4: 21 it is, 'as the truth is in *the* Jesus' (see note b, Darby Trans.), as if the Spirit of God would concentrate our thoughts on that Man.
Rem. It says of the eunuch, Philip "announced the glad tidings of Jesus to him".
C.A.C. That is very fine.
{457}
THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD
The gospel comes to man to extricate him from the power of evil, and to invest him with moral beauty in place of his natural uncomeliness, but it also reveals the righteousness of God. None of us has any righteousness of his own, but "righteousness of God is revealed" in the glad tidings. It is well for us to understand thoroughly what this means.
God is righteous in all His ways. He is righteous in punishing the wicked, and in so ordering that men reap as they sow. He is righteous in taking account of all that pleases Him in His people, and in compensating them for what they suffer from the ungodly. The righteousness of God as referred to in the Old Testament has very largely this character.
But there are scriptures in the Old Testament which refer to God's righteousness in another connection. For example, we read in @Psalm 22: 31, "They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done it". What a marvellous character the righteousness of God has in that psalm!
It gives us the utterance of Christ as the forsaken One, passing through the unfathomable sufferings of that dark hour when atonement was made. He has so glorified God in bearing sins, and suffering the judgment due to sin, that we find that those who fear God, and who seek God, are able to praise and glorify Him. "All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto Jehovah, and all the families of the nations shall worship before thee". He has provided One who could bear the judgment due to sin and to sinners, so that He might become the praise of all those who seek Him. The psalm does not speak in so many words of their being *justified*, but the fact that they praise and are satisfied and worship implies that they are. Here we see plainly the sufferings of Christ in atonement as the ground of blessing
{458}
to the ends of the earth, and this declared to be God's righteousness.
Another Old Testament scripture helps us to see the character of God's righteousness in this way of grace. "My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him, ... that ye may know the righteousness of Jehovah" (@Micah 6: 5). Balak would have had God's people cursed, but the answer given to him was, "Behold, I have received mission to bless; and he hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it. He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen wrong in Israel" (@Numbers 23: 20, 21). That was, as Micah tells us, "the righteousness of Jehovah". It was really on the ground of the death of Christ -- though that death was yet future -- that God could in righteousness thus regard His people. The wondrous work of Christ upon the cross has so glorified God, so vindicated Him, that He can justify -- or hold as righteous -- every one who believes the glad tidings, and His righteousness is revealed in His so doing. It was "borne witness to by the law and the prophets" (@Romans 3: 21), but it is now "revealed" and "manifested".
Is it not wonderful "glad tidings", that the righteousness of God should be known to us in the way of mercy and grace, and in absolving us from every charge? Thus sinful and ungodly men can be justified from all things that stand against them, without any works of their own. It is entirely *of God* that this should be; His righteousness is revealed thereby.
The Jews were "ignorant of God's righteousness" (@Romans 10: 3). That does not mean that they did not know that God was righteous, but they were ignorant of that which was revealed in the glad tidings; namely, that in infinite grace God is the Justifier of every one that believes. Hence they sought to establish their own righteousness -- as so many are doing today -- and did not submit to the righteousness of God. God has revealed His righteousness in the way of perfect
{459}
grace; it is for man, the guilty creature, to submit to it, and consequently to find the knowledge of God. Without it nothing can be built up, in a divine way, in the soul. It is a question of the light of God into which we come through faith.
No natural process of reasoning could ever bring us to know the righteousness of God in justifying the ungodly. It is brought in "on the principle of faith", and God was entitled to reveal His righteousness in that way. In no other way could it have been revealed to a fallen and guilty creature in the way of blessing. The sin of man has not deprived God of the right to take His own course, and His sinful creatures can rejoice that this is the case, for it constitutes their only outlet from ruin and condemnation. How we can glory in the righteousness of God as thus revealed! How we can boast in the blessed God as thus known to us! Like the convicted and repentant man of @Psalm 51, delivered from blood-guiltiness, we can sing aloud of His righteousness.
"How can man be just with God?" was asked by Job about two thousand years before Christ appeared. The question is answered now; the whole secret and way of it is out; God has His own blessed way of bringing it about. His righteousness is "by faith of Jesus Christ towards all". It is brought in "on the principle of faith", in contrast with any works or merit on man's part; and no subsequent works or service of the believer can make God one whit more righteous in justifying him. The ground of it was laid in the death of Christ, and nothing can be added to it by man; it is "righteousness *of God*" (@Romans 1: 17).
In a coming day the righteousness of God will be known publicly, for He will have judged all evil, and fulfilled all His promises of blessing. "Jehovah hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the nations. He hath remembered his loving-kindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God" (@Psalm 98: 2, 3). But
{460}
at the present time God's righteousness is not in public display; it is revealed "on the principle of faith, to faith". On the ground of the death of Christ God can exonerate from every charge the creature who has sinned and come short of His glory, and reveal His righteousness in doing it. No claim of His throne has been set aside at all; His glory has been fully met; and now His righteousness is favourable to sinful men.
But no reasoning on man's part, no influence of natural religion, no exercise of conscience in itself, could ever arrive at this knowledge. But being revealed it is known to faith, and to faith only. Our works or our conduct have nothing to do with it; it is purely and altogether a question of how God has revealed Himself, and of the character in which faith knows Him. Hence it is written, "But the just shall live by faith". It is rather striking that Paul should bring in this scripture, which suggests that the faith principle is something to live by. It is not simply that one is justified by faith at some particular moment, when one believes the glad tidings, but the one who is in the place of a just man with God lives on that principle. He has continuously before him the righteousness of God, and the way in which God has dealt with sin in the death of Christ. He is thus maintained in self-judgment with an abiding sense of the ground on which he is with God. It is the foundation and secret of true piety, and of a holy, happy life. If we do not know the righteousness of God thus, there can be no solid peace, and no true enjoyment of His love.
There is not the slightest toleration of unrighteousness with God. On the contrary, "There is revealed wrath of God from heaven upon all impiety, and unrighteousness of men". That wrath was revealed at Calvary, when the holy Sin-bearer was forsaken by God. The unrighteousness of men came before God there in its totality, as taken up in grace by Him who was personally the righteous One, and the wrath of God was upon it. What men deserved has come upon One
{461}
who took it up as sent by God for that very purpose, and in His bearing it, it has been revealed that unrighteousness must come under the wrath of God. The wrath of God upon all unrighteousness in the vicarious judgment-bearing of Christ on the cross is the foundation on which God's righteousness can be known in the way of grace, but it is also the solemn witness of what will come upon men if they continue in unrighteousness and do not obey the glad tidings. We need to have the truth of this deeply laid in our souls in these days when men have such loose and human thoughts of mercy, grace and love.
The thought of mercy and grace has been gathered from Scripture, but in men's minds these things are divorced from what happened at Calvary, and the truth is really held in unrighteousness. The heathen, the moralist and the Jew all have some measure of truth; the Christian as having the Scriptures has the whole truth; but all, apart from divine calling, hold it in unrighteousness. If men speak or think of the love of God in such a way as to lose sight of the reality of His wrath, they hold the truth in unrighteousness. The fact is that His love is known through His beloved Son having come as Man to drink the awful cup of atoning sorrows, and to bear the wrath due to unrighteousness. It is on this ground that righteousness comes in for guilty men. "But to those that are contentious, and are disobedient to the truth, but obey unrighteousness, there shall be wrath and indignation, tribulation and distress, on every soul of man that works evil, both of Jew first, and of Greek" (@Romans 2: 8, 9).
At the cross we see heaven's estimate of unrighteousness. If men do not avail themselves of the righteousness of God for blessing, on the ground of Christ's judgment-bearing, they will most assuredly have to undergo for themselves "wrath, in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, who shall render to each according to his works" (@Romans 2: 5, 6).
{462}
NOTES OF A READING
@Romans 4: 1 - 25
C.A.C. Would you say that the difference between this chapter and the one we read last week is mainly that in the third chapter we have the righteousness of God, and in this the righteousness of faith?
Rem. I was thinking that chapter 3 seems to bring forward the righteousness of God, while this shows how we come practically into the good of it. Is that in line with what you are saying?
C.A.C. Yes, I think so. I suppose "righteousness of God" came in because man has none.
Ques. Is the one the resource and the other the way we come into the good of it?
C.A.C. Yes; chapter 3 makes it plain God is the resource, it is "righteousness of God by faith of Jesus Christ"; but here God accounts the faith of the believer righteousness. It is that the believer becomes possessed of the righteousness which is of faith. It is what the believer gets.
What we find in these two chapters is what comes in in contrast to the whole state of sin in which man is found. It is not only that he has done wrong things, but God has moved to bring things into adjustment. If God justifies a man there is a moral adjustment.
Ques. Is faith the first element of righteousness in a man?
C.A.C. Surely, it is the first right movement Godward.
Rem. Scripture does not say Abraham obtained righteousness on account of his faith, but it says faith is reckoned to him as righteousness.
C.A.C. Well, it is in virtue of having faith that he has righteousness reckoned to him.
{463}
Rem. Speaking of adjustment, faith gives God His right place in a man's soul.
C.A.C. And it enables God to count the one righteous who has it.
Rem. "Righteousness of God by faith of Jesus Christ towards all, and upon all those who believe". Could you sum it up in another word other than righteousness? It is not that faith is the righteousness, but the righteousness is there by faith. "Of him are *ye* in Christ Jesus, who has been made to us ... righteousness" (@1 Corinthians 1: 30).
C.A.C. That gives the completeness of it, that Christ is made unto us righteousness. That must be a righteousness entirely of God, but brought in for man, but particularly for faith.
Ques. Why is this chapter worked out in relation to Abraham?
C.A.C. It is one of the most striking things in the Old Testament. In @Genesis 15 it came out that righteousness was reckoned to him without works and without law; that is, apart from them altogether. It was the outstanding example.
Ques. Does it involve our thoughts being set aside and our coming into God's thoughts?
Rem. The thought of promise seems connected with the righteousness in verse 13.
C.A.C. Yes, so that righteousness is the necessary basis of the introduction of all God has in His mind for man. How could He bring in any of His great thoughts for man apart from righteousness? It is essential that man should have a righteousness that is of faith and therefore altogether of God.
Rem. There could be no righteousness of faith if no basis had been laid in the death of Christ.
Rem. It is the way God can meet the question of sin, but we come in simply, by faith, blessing God.
C.A.C. And that glorifies God.
Ques. In @James 2: 23, 24 it says, "Abraham believed
{464}
God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness", and "a man is justified on the principle of works, and not on the principle of faith only". How does that fit in?
C.A.C. Well, it indicates that if I am righteous on the principle of faith, it is bound to work out in a practical way. The reason why Christians are so slack in their walk and ways is that they have not apprehended the grace of God as setting them up in righteousness before Him. I should be very careful not to let a spot come, contrary to the righteousness with which I am invested. All this is in view of putting us right practically. But the first thing is I have a righteousness that cannot be improved upon to all eternity; so that I do not let a spot come in where God has removed them all. So I suppose that while the seal of Abraham's faith was circumcision, which is a distinct refusal of the flesh, the seal for us is the Holy Spirit as the power to set the flesh aside completely. I believe that anyone who understood how God had set him up in righteousness would be most prayerful and careful, most particular not to have a spot or stain. I think it is wonderful to see that if God accounts faith as righteousness, it is a righteousness that meets the whole question of sin and meets it perfectly. Well, if I am set up with that, I am a wonderful person, and I must keep myself without a stain. The Spirit is the seal of the righteousness of faith for us.
Ques. Am I justified because God has reckoned righteousness to me?
C.A.C. Yes. Righteousness reckoned is only found in Paul's writings; it is part of Paul's doctrine, and it clears the ground for all God has for us to come into connected with Christ as Head.
There is a little difference between forgiveness and justification. Forgiveness of sins is presented in the gospel for men to be encouraged to turn to God. When Christ was here, "God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their offences" (@2 Corinthians 5: 19). God was in that attitude, He was not raising any questions that would
{465}
keep them at a distance, but came near to them. His approach to men in Christ was that they might turn to Him. God is in the attitude of forgiveness towards His guilty creatures; so that they should turn to Him and learn Paul's doctrine of righteousness.
Rem. @Psalm 32 refers to both points.
C.A.C. It is very wonderful there is a testimony to it that God would take this ground of not reckoning sin, but reckoning righteousness, and the one who has received the forgiveness of sins is also justified. There is no repentance without faith. Faith comes first, or more accurately new birth comes first, then the activity of faith. Repentance and remission of sins are preached to all nations to encourage men to turn to God.
Rem. "Through this man remission of sins is preached to you, ... in him every one that believes is justified" (@Acts 13: 38, 39).
C.A.C. Yes, and where there is this faith, God justifies.
Rem. What I find a practical difficulty among many is that forgiveness is known by them, but not justification.
C.A.C. It is your business to *make them know it*!
Ques. How do you do that?
C.A.C. Tell them God is the Justifier.
Rem. They do not understand it.
C.A.C. That is for the preacher to look after.
Rem. Justification means you stand up as cleared as a man who has never sinned.
C.A.C. God has not only forgiveness with Him that He may be feared, but God is the Justifier. If a man is exercised about his state he is born anew, and has some sense in his soul that all good and blessing must come in from God. He may turn to Him without much intelligence; many of us know how unintelligently we do turn to Him.
Rem. I wondered if Naaman the Syrian would illustrate the justified person. He did not come out of the Jordan a leper, he came out cleared of leprosy.
{466}
C.A.C. Yes, he came up in an entirely new state, his flesh was as a little child's.
Rem. In @Acts 2 they said, "What shall we do, brethren?" Peter did not tell them to believe.
C.A.C. Because they *had* believed Peter's word, and say, "What shall we do?" They had crucified the Messiah; all the promises were gone.
Ques. Does repentance come before faith?
C.A.C. You would have repentance without faith then.
Rem. No, No.
C.A.C. Some light from God must come into give a man any movement of repentance. Light coming in makes him feel what a wretched, sinful creature he is, and he must look to God for help to come in. And behind all is new birth. Man naturally is dead in offences and sins; it is not possible that there is any movement Godward from the natural man. With conviction there is always attraction; a man who feels himself a sinner turns to God, he knows there is no help anywhere else. Like Peter who said, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord", and yet he goes and falls at His knees.
Rem. Faith comes by hearing.
C.A.C. There would be no faith apart from some communication from God; it is God's *word* in every case that originates faith.
Rem. People labour to work up faith in persons, or in themselves; it does not come that way.
C.A.C. We have to tell them what there is to believe. Sometimes you hear a preaching full of exhortations to believe; it is much better to tell people what to believe.
Rem. It has been said that faith is light in the soul.
Ques. Why is righteousness brought in in connection with Abraham being heir of the world?
C.A.C. It suggests what is in the mind of God, that Abraham should be heir of the world, and all nations blessed in him on the faith principle. He was heir of the world on the principle of having the righteousness of faith. The fact
{467}
that it is a matter of promise shows it is altogether on God's side. A whole system of things is brought in in connection with the headship of Christ and all that is before the mind of God for man; but it can only be brought in on the principle of the righteousness of faith. It was "of faith, that it might be according to grace".. It would do us good to sit down and think, What *are* the thoughts of God in relation to me? What has He in mind, what kind of righteousness? It is something wrought by the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. It is called "the free gift of righteousness". It is a free gift. If a king bestows a gift, what a great thing it is, but if God bestows a gift, what a magnificent thing it must be! It is something worthy of Himself.
Ques. Is that where the blessedness comes in?
C.A.C. Yes, it is a most blessed thing. Blessedness is that which is in relation to God. How precious to know He has set us up before Him in a way that is perfectly satisfactory to Himself, it cannot be improved. The youngest and feeblest believer has it as much as the apostle Paul.
As to the matter of righteousness the believer is divinely adjusted. The only link with it is faith; so God is before the believer, and Christ is before him, and the righteousness reckoned to him is absolutely perfect. And it works out morally in great exercise that we should not let anything come in contrary to the righteousness with which we are invested. The knowledge of it is a very sanctifying thing. We may get away from this blessedness, but that does not alter God's mind.
Rem. I suppose it first comes in when God says, I am going to bring Christ in. So that for God He is everything and for us He is everything.
C.A.C. And we find at the end of this chapter justification is connected with resurrection. "Who ... has been raised for our justification". That gives a wonderful thought of the righteousness that is reckoned to us; it is Christ risen, so really we are justified in a risen Christ. God has raised
{468}
from among the dead Jesus our Lord for our justification; so that makes it quite clear we are not justified for this world, but for God's world. If the righteousness of faith is according to Christ risen, how perfect it is; there is a Man completely outside the region of sin and death, having borne the judgment of it. He is out of the whole state connected with the state of sin, and as justified in Him, we are as clear as He is.
Rem. "In order to the promise being sure to all the seed" (verse 16) is important.
C.A.C. The heavenly seed has now come into view, and they are all righteous. Abraham saw the stars.
Rem. The God in whom he believed "calls the things which be not as being"; that is important.
C.A.C. It shows God is acting in a scene of death and where there is nothing; death is upon all men. There is nothing for God until He brings something in. That is the scene He is operating in; it requires His quickening power, and requires Him to speak of things and to propose things that have no existence.
Ques. Why is Abraham "heir of the world"?
C.A.C. I suppose because God having introduced the principle of faith, that is brought in as the ground on which the world could be held for God. It had in view all that God will bring in actually for the world, and for us all that God has in mind to bring us under the headship of Christ, the whole realm from peace with God right up to eternal life. The ground is cleared, and there is nothing left to hinder us coming into all the wealth connected with Christ as Head, all the wealth that is in Him as Head.
{469}
NOTES OF A READING
@Romans 5: 1 - 11
C.A.C. It is good to see that in receiving what comes to us from God through our Lord Jesus Christ, we have in every case what cannot be improved upon.
The Son of God is the great subject of the gospel, and what comes in by Him and through His death cannot possibly be improved upon. If God brings in righteousness, which He has brought in on the ground of redemption, it cannot be improved upon. We may have to add other things that have their part in the economy of blessing.
Rem. So that finality is reached, would you say, and the soul comes into peace.
C.A.C. And it leads up to that wonderful statement that being justified by faith we have peace with God; that the state of the believer through grace is divinely perfect, it cannot be improved upon. You cannot improve upon peace with God in that sense.
Ques. Is there a difference between believing on God and believing on the Lord Jesus Christ?
C.A.C. I think that now these things go necessarily together; you cannot have such a thing as a person merely believing on God; because faith must take its character and derive its substance from the revelation of God. It must be a complete revelation. In the Old Testament we read very little about faith. I believe it is only mentioned in @Habakkuk 2: 4, "The just shall live by his faith", and that was a prophetic statement. It is not till God comes into view in the fulness of His grace and in the light of redemption that you have adequate conditions for the development of faith in the human heart.
Rem. We see the great advantage of being brought into the faith period.
{470}
C.A.C. I should think so! It is quite certain the revelation of God cannot be improved upon, nor can what has come in by Christ and His death. If you lived a thousand years you would never advance on what you began with, though your apprehension of it may increase; the thing itself is as great at the beginning as at the end; and God has been pleased to act in such a way that wherever faith is He associates with it this blessed reality of divine righteousness.
Rem. The great point really is the light of God in revelation.
C.A.C. Perhaps there are some just waking up to beginning at the right end; that is with God. All that has come in by way of sin and death leaves room for the blessed God to bring out what is in His heart for man. The epistle leads up to reconciliation and the saints brought into the children's place and sonship. It would help us greatly if we saw that we started with the best. The youngest babe in Christ starts with it, he is invested with a perfect divine righteousness that meets every divine requirement of God on the line of righteousness.
Rem. It leads to God being absolutely glorified.
C.A.C. That is it. So that God should be the spring and source and ground of our joy at the very outset. So with regard to justification it requires not only *the death* of Christ. Christ is the Mercy-seat as risen; He never had that place before He was risen. The thought of death was there, but there was not exactly the thought of resurrection in the Mosaic mercy-seat. You would not get the complete thought without resurrection; that is why the Old Testament comes short, you could not have the thought of resurrection with any sacrifice.
Rem. In the offering for the cleansing of the leper, the bird set free alive seems to suggest resurrection (@Leviticus 14).
C.A.C. One bird had to be, and it comes back typically from death, but not actually. So with Isaac: "Whence also he received him in a figure" (@Hebrews 11: 19). This question of justification
{471}
could not be settled apart from resurrection, for man is under death as the judgment of God, therefore death needs to be set aside.
Rem. It involves the truth of another Man.
C.A.C. I think this truth of justification and divine righteousness touches the state of man as well as his guilt.
Rem. The *person* needs justifying. The death of Christ deals with offences and clears them, would you say?
C.A.C. The death of Christ deals with the whole state of man. So that in the blood on the mercy-seat the whole matter of the state of fallen man is met, and God glorified in it all; and the justification is on that footing.
Rem. It must be effected in another Man or it would be removal simply and nothing brought in for God.
C.A.C. There are different aspects of this justification. "Justification freely by his grace", "Justified in the power of his blood", "Justified by faith": all are different aspects of this wondrous favour of God to man.
Ques. Why is Abraham brought in (chapter 4)?
C.A.C. Abraham leads on to this thought of resurrection. He had to learn he was dead and nothing could be brought in according to the mind of God, except in the power of resurrection.
Ques. Is resurrection a revelation?
C.A.C. Yes. It has been said that God is revealed in these early chapters in righteousness, in power and in love, and His power is revealed in the resurrection of Christ and becomes available to every poor sinner that realises he is as good as dead. In regard to justification we are as helpless as if we were actually dead!
Ques. It is said sometimes Christ raised for our justification is a proof that God is entirely satisfied as to sin; is that right?
C.A.C. I doubt whether it is so presented in Scripture. If divine Persons take a thing in hand, nothing can be required to assure us of the satisfactoriness of the work. They must
{472}
operate successfully for God to be God. It does not require the evidence of resurrection that the work was done. The rending of the veil was the most striking intimation that God was entirely free to come out in the revelation of Himself to His poor creatures, but that was not in evidence. It is "raised again for our justification", so that we should get a most exalted thought of our justification. It places us in the place and perfection of Christ. He is entirely suitable for God and for His world, and we stand in that. So in Galatians he speaks of being justified in Christ, that is, in another Man. We are placed with God in suitability to all that God is. "Righteousness of *God*" means that everything is according to God's thought; it is His estimate of righteousness.
Ques. Would you say something as to divine reckoning?
C.A.C. That is very important. God has away of reckoning and we have to come into line with it. He reckons on the principle of what has been effected by the death of the Lord Jesus; what God does has always to be based on that. On the other hand God is pleased to put a foundation in the soul of man which is this principle of faith, which is as purely of God as the work of Christ on the cross. It was not likely that God would move to no effect, and however wonderfully He moved, it would have no effect if there were no principle in the heart of man to link His grace with. New birth is at the back. So that man becomes receptive, and where faith is He is pleased to bring in righteousness -- His own righteousness -- and identify the soul with it. This is the first element in the divine adjustment that God effects for men.
Ques. It is along way to "this favour in which we stand". What would be the difference between what we receive by faith and what we have by the Spirit?
C.A.C. It is striking to see that in the first four chapters there is no reference to the Spirit, except in chapter 1 in reference to the Lord's resurrection -- it is all faith. And whatever light comes to us from God becomes the substance to us in our souls; and there must be something there for the
{473}
Holy Spirit to connect Himself with. Faith brings the light of God and of redemption -- all that we preach in the gospel -- until there is something there in the soul for the Holy Spirit to link Himself on to. Where there is new birth there is. A newborn soul must thirst for God, and any ray of light from God is exceedingly precious. In this system of blessing, of faith, there is something for the Holy Spirit to link on to.
There is no mention of the Spirit until now, and it does not say when the Spirit is received. I used to think Paul ought to have put in a chapter here to say how the Spirit is received, but what he is doing is building up the soul of man, so that there should be something built up there for the Spirit to recognise, and he drops on us all at once by saying, "The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us". What I have to take care about is that I have to be very exercised that I am marked by such features that the Spirit can put His seal upon. It all comes to us through the gospel. There is no such thing as finding faith in the fallen man.
Ques. All in christianity is on the principle of giving, would you say?
C.A.C. And our great business is to learn it -- that we may learn God. There is one thing I want as born anew -- I must have God. Very often we start from our own side, and very likely we shall finish there. We want to start with God. Nicodemus had the idea. I do not know why he should be run down; he was a very fine character. He said, "We know that thou art come a teacher from *God*" (@John 3: 2). He was not content with what was outward as a ruler of the Jews or judaism, but he saw before him in Christ One who could unfold God to him.
God means to gratify His own heart. He might have left Adam alone. I think Adam never expected He would come into the garden. He came seeking man, that is why He came. He set His heart on that creature, and said, I am not going to be robbed of him, I am going to have him for My pleasure
{474}
and My glory. It has been said, God is sufficient for Himself in everything, excepting His love. God's love would not let Him rest.
In every soul born anew there is some impression of Christ and some appreciation of Christ, from Abel downwards.
Rem. The psalmist said, "As the hart panteth after the water-brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God" (@Psalm 42: 1).
C.A.C. People are not satisfied because they do not thirst. "If any one thirst, let him come to me and drink". However much you try, you cannot make people thirst.
Rem. Cornelius said, "*We* are all present before God to hear all things that are commanded thee of God" (@Acts 10: 33). And it says the Holy Spirit fell on them.
C.A.C. It is very fine. There was faith there undoubtedly, and it was while Peter was yet speaking that the Holy Spirit fell on them. It would be nice to have people converted the first sentence of your preaching! I do not see that anybody will drink until they thirst.
Ques. Would not thirst be accumulative, each impression creating further thirst?
C.A.C. Yes, on the line of thirst we should increase; we want to cultivate intense appreciation of every bit of light we get -- elementary or advanced. The elementary is perfect, So it brings a delight and satisfaction. It leads up to peace with God; there is serenity and peace, the outcome of what has been learned of God. If we just gave ourselves up to seek the knowledge of God all the time, what a happy people we should be.
Rem. We need things in order.
C.A.C. It would help us to apprehend this epistle to see that everything is set out in divine order. We do not begin rightly unless we begin in @Romans 3. God's glad tidings -- what is in His heart for men -- is fully provided and supplied in absolute perfection, so that you cannot improve on it. So this fifth chapter is a most wonderful unfolding of the structure of grace in a man. It is not a matter of doctrine, as we
{475}
may sometimes think, but there is the consciousness that God is pleased with us. The soul is filled with the consciousness that God is delighted with me. I do not know the gospel unless I know that.
Rem. It can only be in Christ.
C.A.C. Well, does not God put you in Christ? And every part of the gospel is primarily for His own satisfaction and glory. What a wonderful moment it is for the soul when it wakes up to the fact that the glory of the blessed God is bound up with my blessing!
I suppose we have all noticed that there is no appropriation until we come to this chapter. The truth of the glad tidings is presented down to the end of the fourth chapter in a general way. Things are stated from God's side, but there is no evidence of their being taken up till the fifth chapter. I was wondering whether it did not suggest to us the importance of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus as being necessary before there could be appropriation by the saints of what is in the mind of God, particularly of course in regard of justification.
Ques. You would say we could not come into the good of these things apart from the resurrection of Christ?
C.A.C. Is it not true that the thing was never defined till then? It could not be defined or appropriated before, as it did not exist. There are many souls who are blessedly attracted by the perfection of the Lord Jesus as presented in the gospels, who rightly find comfort in His grace and find Him precious, but He was not then risen from among the dead.
Rem. It is a retrospection with us, justification by faith and by blood, we look back.
C.A.C. I think it is good for us to remember that we all have to learn the gospel after we are converted. Often the beginning is vague and uncertain, and therefore souls are not immune to doubts and misgivings, and even those who may be putting their trust alone in the death and the blood of Christ may not really have divine peace. They are converted,
{476}
they have definitely turned to God. And many people are justified in the sight of God who have not apprehended it for themselves. As we have been seeing, if one has the faith of Jesus, God justifies him, and if one has the faith of Jesus Christ, God justifies him; but he may not have the consciousness of being justified so as to have peace with God. I do not see how one could have that without the truth of resurrection. The style and manner of our justification are defined in a risen Christ, so you could hardly get it at the cross. I think God could pronounce many a person justified who does not at all apprehend it, or the character of the justification, because he has not come to the faith of God as the raiser of our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead for our justification.
They have not reached God's starting point, for that is resurrection. We must start there -- it is important to get hold of that in our relations with God. The saints in early days had to wait for Paul till they knew this. The disciples on the day of Pentecost did not know it. Resurrection is a thing that is impossible for the human mind to entertain. It can only be known to faith. It is as impossible to conceive of by the human mind as creation is.
Rem. "In him everyone that believes is justified" (@Acts 13: 39). It is the truth of an ascended Man.
C.A.C. Does not that bring in something very positive? Not only are sins gone, they have been borne and put away on the cross, but it does not quite give the full thought of being justified. God has put Him in a position where it is absolutely impossible for sin or sins or death to have anything to do with Him. And He is put there for our justification, because God's mind is that we should be as clear before Him as Christ.
Ques. The being justified on the principle of faith and in the power of His blood -- are they two parts of the same thing?
C.A.C. Well, the efficacious ground of it is the blood which meets the glory of God. It meets the question of sin and sins and settles everything *for God*; but does not give us
{477}
what J.N.D. calls a subsisting righteousness. It is a clearance, but hardly gives a new status.
Rem. That is found in a living Person.
C.A.C. Yes. All the bad has gone in the value of the blood, but there is something left -- Christ risen from the dead, after the value of the blood had been fully secured. So there is a risen Man in God's presence who is perfectly suitable to God, now and for all eternity; and He is the believer's righteousness.
Rem. It says, He has entered in once for all into the holy of holies "by his own blood", in Hebrews.
C.A.C. He has gone in on the same ground on which we can go in.
Ques. "But ye have been justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God" (@1 Corinthians 6: 11). How does that come in?
C.A.C. Is he not bringing in there the full value of what he had developed ("Ye have been washed", etc.), into which the Corinthians little entered? It all stood in the value of that Name and in the power of the Spirit. He looks at it in its completeness.
"Our Lord Jesus Christ" is the risen and glorified Man, and we (those who have) have appropriated Him thus, and *we have peace towards God* -- there is appropriation.
Rem. The appropriation of that blessed Person as He now is must be a complete justification.
C.A.C. Indeed it is. It is the fixed position in which believers are set who have the faith of resurrection; that is, confidence in God who has raised Christ from the dead. So all our intercourse with God is based on that fact, that He is the raiser up of our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead. How perfectly free that makes us with God. We have a consciousness of having a fixed favour with God.
Ques. Why is it so many have not peace?
C.A.C. Because in most cases the risen Christ has never been set before them as the expression of God's thought for them, or it has not been taken in. I know I was breaking
{478}
bread a long time, and preaching the gospel too, before I took it in.
In the religious world there is very little said about the resurrection and its bearing on the position the believer is in with God. Justification by faith is the doctrine of Protestantism, but the real value of it is not widely known.
Rem. It is the knowledge of how God has taken up the sin question and settled it for His pleasure.
C.A.C. That brings the sense of divine favour into the soul.
Ques. Why does it say here, "We boast in hope of the glory of God"?
C.A.C. Because there is the assured conviction in the heart that the more the glory of God shines out the better it is for us. We should like that every trace of the glory of man should disappear and only the glory of God shine out; that would be the supreme blessedness of every saint of God. It has been the glory of God particularly to raise His Son from the dead; it is the glory of God in a special way as we know it.
"Did I not say to thee, that if thou shouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?" (@John 11: 40). The death of Lazarus was an opportunity for the Son of God and for God to be glorified. God is really glorified in resurrection.
Rem. It is all working out for everything to be as God wishes, and that is reconciliation.
C.A.C. The apostle is bringing out all this that we may be qualified to be in the assembly properly. Those who know God in the power of resurrection are sure that in His own time He will set aside everything that is not in correspondence with His glory, whether death, sin or Satan's power.
He is going to clear the whole scene of everything but His own glory, and the saints delight to think of it.
Rem. And we can live in the enjoyment of it *now*.
Rem. It says, "Who has raised him from among the dead and given him glory, that your faith and hope should be in God" (@1 Peter 1: 21).
Rem. "Preaching by Jesus the resurrection" (@Acts 4: 2).
{479}
C.A.C. I doubt if we apprehend the Lord's death or His life in a divine way apart from His resurrection. His resurrection throws divine light on both. All must be seen in the light of resurrection.
Ques. It says "we shall be saved in the power of his life" -- not by His death, emphasising the fact that everything is in a risen Man, would you say? Does it not bring in the priesthood of Christ?
C.A.C. Well, you see that raises the question whether we are near enough to get it. I think all the grace that is in Him is available for saints, but it is only acquired in personal nearness to Him. And it is not exactly His life in heaven, but His life is available for us. It is like the woman who touched the hem of His garment, it needed contact. I think it is His life in contrast with His death. The One who died is the living One, living in nearness to be made use of. We need to be preserved from every form of the power of evil; we do not need to be saved from God, do we?
Rem. If the death, so the life. If something is brought about by the death, then something is brought about by the life, the argument is.
C.A.C. And He is available. When here on earth it was so, the woman drew virtue out of Him. It is Christ *near* (that is why I said not in heaven) so that He is available. Should any of us be preserved from evil at a distance from Him? So the real power of deliverance is not in doctrine, it lies in appropriating what is in the living One. There is no distance, we have no journey of any kind to take. He is *near*.
Rem. He was raised "by the glory of the Father". Are we to appropriate the Father like that?
C.A.C. Well, that glory is now to throw its lustre over our everyday practical life. The glory of the Father wrapped itself round the Lord and brought Him out of Joseph's tomb. The glory of the Father would operate in the saints to enable them to walk in a different kind of life from what they ever did before.
First we get boasting in the hope of glory and now it is
{480}
boasting "in tribulations" -- what a contrast! It is exceedingly practical; tribulations test the value that we put upon God, things that are trying and testing, and a very little thing may upset a saint, something that is contrary to our thoughts. It just shows we are practically infidels, we do not set any value on God! We drift along asleep sometimes and the tribulations compel us to make practical use of God, they are a help to us in that way. We find a rude shock was not to be deplored but to boast in, it found an avenue that the blessed God could be known as a reality -- as He had not been known before.
If we bring God in it effects us profoundly. Many are having severe tribulation at the present time; those who bring God in find they develop the quality of endurance, a precious feature of Christ which is so pleasing to God. Endurance is the ability to go on when things are most trying to you, which do not suit you at all, because you are finding the value of God.
Ques. "And endurance, experience", what does that mean?
C.A.C. It is really a wonderful thing, because it means the practical *proving* of what God can be to His people in tribulation -- not believing it, but *proving* it. The more we prove God, the more hopeful we are because we are fully satisfied that He will not change. The word experience means proving it. An old lady used to put T &amp; P against texts in her Bible -- 'Tried and Proved'. We should covet experience; what is the good of a lot of doctrine and no proving of God?
Rem. Paul said, "I believe God".
C.A.C. That brightens all the future, because hope grows out of experience. We may say reverently, God loves to be proved. He will never let you down. And that leads Paul to bring in the fact that the Holy Spirit has been given to us.
We have noticed that there is no reference to the Spirit before this chapter, but it is rather important in this connection,
{481}
because the eighth chapter is the chapter of the Spirit -- it is not really his subject here. The point is that we should be established in faith. We should bear in mind that the Spirit will never carry us one inch beyond our faith.
In the first four chapters the apostle is occupied in building upon faith. The Spirit will support us in everything of faith, but we must not expect He will help us beyond our faith.
It is essential that Christ should be known as risen, for there is nothing for the Spirit to link on with till Christ is known as the righteousness of the believer. He must link Himself on to what is perfect, He cannot link on to what is imperfect. In @Ephesians 1 they had received a full gospel, so there was something in them He could identify Himself with. He could never identify Himself with doubts and fears. "Filled with the Spirit" is the normal condition for a believer. I should not like to say I was, I should like to be. If I gave no place to the flesh I should be filled with the Spirit. Believers are often like a bottle with a cork in, there is an obstruction. The Spirit will not remove the cork, it is for me to do that.
"The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us". It brings before us the delight of the Spirit of God to make us conscious of the love of God by bringing before us the death of Christ. And the Spirit of God would occupy us more with the death of Christ. We do not yield ourselves to the Spirit in occupying us with the death of Christ, that He might develop precious thoughts of it with us. We cannot help being occupied with it one day a week, but there are six days when the death of Christ perhaps has not very much place with us. We need to ponder it every day.
Rem. "Through the death of his Son" is a touching expression.
C.A.C. Yes, it is. We cannot think that the blessed God ever forgets -- it is the death of His Son; and if we are moving in fellowship with God the death of Christ has an increasing
{482}
place with us, and the Spirit of God would use it to give us a profound sense of the love of God. The death of Christ does not leave anything behind.
Rem. It is not so much the thought of sacrifice here as an expression of the perfection of divine love.
C.A.C. That is what it is here. So that it is in spite of what we were as sinners -- that we might know the heart of God. It is not so much the efficacy side, but more the witness of it.
{483}
NOTES OF A READING
@Romans 5: 1 - 21
Rem. It is a good way on in the epistle that we have "peace with God". I suppose a knowledge of divine Persons is necessary for peace.
Ques. Did these Roman Christians know it?
C.A.C. The epistle is written that believers might know the great wealth they have in the knowledge of God. It is most important to know divine Persons.
Rem. Paul says of these believers in chapter 1: 8 that their "faith is proclaimed in the whole world", but I suppose they needed educating in these things.
C.A.C. The gospel is so wonderful that none of us have compassed it completely.
Rem. The question is, do we know and feel that we are wealthy in the knowledge of God?
C.A.C. You could not think that you were poor in the light of this chapter! It is very wonderful how the apostle brings in one thing after another. It is an orderly unfolding of the gospel. The different elements of it are opened out one after another. It is a question of knowing God. God has come out to make Himself known to us. God is seen as Justifier: so that we are entirely clear for His world. God's world is soon to be made manifest. He has justified us in view of His own world. We believe on God: "Believing on him who has raised from among the dead Jesus our Lord, who ... has been raised for our justification". We are justified for that resurrection world where Christ is. Faith has the present gain and joy of it. We are clear of every charge for that world where Jesus our Lord is, and we sit here tonight in that happy consciousness. There is a world of God's pleasure, where everything is suited to God. Jesus our Lord has passed into that scene. He is a risen Man. He is in perfect
{484}
suitability to the scene where God has brought Him and He is there in spotless suitability. A risen Man is our justification.
Rem. And that world is beyond death.
C.A.C. We are not justified for a world full of sin where the power of death is. It means something to be justified for God's world. Godward we have the most absolute peace. In regard of all our past history we have peace toward God, cloudless peace. Just as when the Israelites after crossing the Red Sea saw the Egyptians "dead on the sea-shore": they had no more trouble about them. The justifying grace of God is first known in the mercy-seat. God has set Him forth a mercy-seat (chapter 3: 25) in all the power and value of His blood that we might trust in Him. But it is not only His death, but that He is raised. There is no stain and no reproach on Him. He is raised again for our justification.
Rem. The believer is as clear as He is in resurrection.
C.A.C. Yes, and He is not only "raised for our justification" but He is the glorious Administrator of God's wealth in grace "through our Lord Jesus Christ". It is served out by Him. There is not only the value of His death and the complete clearance of His resurrection, but peace is served out to us (just as Joseph served out the corn in Egypt) "through our Lord Jesus Christ". Chapter 3 is His death, chapter 4 is Him risen, but in chapter 5 we get His full title for the first time in the doctrine of the epistle, "our Lord Jesus Christ". He is the glorified One; nothing less is suitable to the grace of God. No one but a glorified Christ could serve it out, the Son of man glorified.
Ques. What as to @Ephesians 4: 8, "Wherefore he says, Having ascended up on high, he ... has given gifts to men"?
C.A.C. That is in it, as @Psalm 68: 18 says, "Thou hast received gifts in Man, and even for the rebellious, for the dwelling there of Jah Elohim"; that is, that we might know God, the Source of all. Godward there is absolute repose of soul. So many are harassed and perplexed, but it is all inconsistent with the gospel.
{485}
Rem. The "therefore" of chapter 5: 1 seems to connect this with what has gone before in chapters 3 and 4.
C.A.C. We need to have peace with God and to know His great favourableness towards us before the Spirit is free to shed abroad in our hearts the love of God (verse 5). The heart is ready for it then. We need to be justified and brought into peace and to understand the great favourableness of God toward us first before we can have His love shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit.
Rem. The foundation is laid first.
C.A.C. We often try to go on with the building before the foundation is attended to.
Ques. Are these steps? "And not only that" (verse 3), "and not only that" (verse 11).
C.A.C. The knowledge of God in grace is being built up in the soul. The object of the epistle is to "establish" us (chapter 1: 11; 16: 25).
Ques. Would you connect "this favour" (verse 2) with the burnt-offering (@Leviticus 1)?
C.A.C. This favour is on the divine side. The burnt-offering is the ground of acceptance on our side; the man comes with it to be in the acceptance of it. This is the extreme favourableness of how God regards us. Acceptance is how I stand with God, but how God stands with me is greater. He is so favourable to me that His favour to me is set forth in a glorified Man. It is God's favourableness to us.
Rem. "He has taken us into favour in the Beloved" (@Ephesians 1: 6).
C.A.C. @Ephesians 1 is how we stand with God. This is the great favourableness of God toward us. In @Luke 15 the prodigal is in disgrace and the question is, How favourable is the father to him before he gets the robe, the ring and the sandals? That is how he is accepted. But the extreme favourableness of the father to him was made known when he saw the father running and falling on his neck and kissing him. God is so favourable to us that He would empty the wealth of heaven upon us and lavish it upon us. Have we come into it?
{486}
"By whom we have also access by faith into this favour in which we stand". It is set forth "through our Lord Jesus Christ". Our side follows. It is so important for souls to know the great favourableness of God towards them. It can never be greater and it will never be less. And it is all set forth in a glorified Man. That is the measure of it. It is greater than my place with God. What God is towards me is greater. I have acceptance before God through the same Person.
Rem. We are so slow to give God credit for what He is.
C.A.C. We have to come into it, into the access. All this supposes the presence of the Spirit. The Holy Spirit is not mentioned till verse 5, but He is given earlier. In Abraham's case, circumcision was "seal of the righteousness of faith" (chapter 4: 11), but now the "seal" is the Spirit. If Abraham is our father, what kind of a father is he? If we are brought into blessing with God we cannot go on with the flesh. The Spirit comes in as the power to set aside the flesh. We cannot have the blessing of God and go on with the flesh. The Spirit is suggested in chapter 4, under the surface. God justifies us that He might give us the Spirit, so that we might set aside the flesh and have the love of God shed abroad in our hearts. Chapter 8 unfolds as teaching what we have suggested in chapter 4. In chapter 8 the soul has recognised the Spirit and is learning how to use the Spirit. In chapter 5 the soul has received the Spirit; he has, as it were, a gold-mine on his estate. But what benefit is that to a man if he does not know it and work it? In chapter 8 the soul knows it possesses the gold-mine and it is worked out and used. The particular point at which we receive the Spirit is not told us. But in chapter 5: 5 the Spirit is doing His delightful work, shedding the love of God abroad in our hearts. God would not occupy us with the moment when we received the Spirit, with an experimental point in our own history. The truth is set forth, and where it is received in faith the Spirit is given. God's desire is to give the Spirit. He has it before Him in the gospel. Each gospel introduces the Lord to us as He who "baptises with
{487}
the Holy Spirit". It was His great mission from God firstly to effect redemption and secondly to baptise with the Holy Spirit. God gives the Spirit as soon as ever He can, as soon as the soul turns from self to God, although he may not recognise the Spirit at the time. In @Exodus 15 the people are singing; typically they had the Spirit but there is no definite type of the Spirit until chapter 17, the smitten rock and the water. Think of a divine Person come into my heart to pour out in my heart what was moving God in sending His Son! What moved Him? Love. The Spirit is the spring in the soul, a new spring in the soul to bring us into the region of satisfied desire, "springing up into eternal life" (@John 4: 14).
Ques. As to "eternal life" in @John 3 and 4, how do you look at it?
C.A.C. In chapter 3 it is what is before the heart of God. God loved men in view of eternal life, outside of sin and death and Satan's power. It was in God's heart to give it. In chapter 4 it is a spring in you, to set your heart in the direction of eternal life. As having done with lusts and pleasures and unsatisfied longings as in the flesh, we can leave our waterpots and taste the blessedness of eternal life. If the heart of God is moving that way, the Spirit is given to move us that way too.
Ques. How are we to deal with souls in regard of their having the Spirit?
C.A.C. In dealing with souls, I should like to make sure that they have the faith of the gospel; if so, God has been faithful and has given the Spirit. Now, the question is, are you using the Spirit, recognising Him and working the goldmine?
Rem. His presence would occupy you with God: "The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us".
Ques. Would you say something as to "justification of life" (verse 18)?
C.A.C. This chapter is the gateway of life. We really live
{488}
in relation to God as justified. The just (or the justified man) lives by faith. It is the first aspect of life. He lives as justified, consciously lives to God as a justified person.
Rem. Joseph in making himself known to his brethren first sets them at rest. Jacob had sent them to Egypt to buy corn "in order that we might live, and not die". Life was in front of them.
Rem. It says, "We also boast in tribulations" (verse 3). I do not know that I do!
C.A.C. It is in connection with boasting "in hope of the glory of God" (verse 2). The glory of God is soon going to come into the world. Look around, and on every hand you see God rejected and lawlessness abounding. But the glory of God is going to come into this world where the glory of man has been and, till that comes in, there must be tribulations. "Knowing that tribulation works endurance" is conscious knowledge. We are conscious of the value of it; we could never boast in it previously. It is far better to be under pressure and to be before God and to watch and pray than to be without pressure and get careless. It is a natural tendency with us all to get careless. Endurance is a beautiful quality of Christ. If you cannot endure, what are you worth for God? What good are you if you cannot bear what tries your spirit? People speak crossly to you, you have a pressure, you are insulted and made to suffer; all this works endurance. You can bear it if you turn to God. The Lord endured: "Consider well him who endured so great contradiction from sinners against himself" (@Hebrews 12: 3). Moses endured "as seeing him who is invisible" (@Hebrews 11: 27). Until the glory of God comes in there will be tribulation and pressure. When you are under pressure you have to turn to God and you find you can bear the very thing you thought you could not bear. "In pressure thou hast enlarged me". "Tribulation works endurance; and endurance, experience". Experience is the proving of things. There was an old woman once who had 'T. &amp; P.' written against many passages in her Bible. When asked what it
{489}
meant she said, 'Tried and Proved'! Experience is the proving of it.
Rem. "Before was afflicted, I went astray" (@Psalm 119: 67).
C.A.C. That is corrective. "It is good for me that I have been afflicted" (@Psalm 119: 71). Christians as such find out that some kind of pressure is very good for them. I have found it out.
{490}
THE INDWELLING OF THE SPIRIT
It is a little remarkable that in Romans the reception of the Spirit is not described. He comes in at a certain point, but there is nothing explained as to how He came. I thought the intention of God was that we should know the presence of the Spirit experimentally. If the love of God is shed abroad in your heart, that is good experience; it is something brought about that is very blessed, it is a heart experience. I have an impression that God gives the Spirit as soon as He can; the Spirit appears in the heart of the believer doing a blessed work for the believer and for God. We want to give the Spirit His place with us. How many of us go from morning until night without appealing to Him? How are we treating that holy, heavenly Guest? We often have to admit we ignore His presence. It is like shutting a visitor up in a room and having nothing to say to him. The flesh may be too much for us, but not for the Spirit.
{491}
NOTES OF A READING
@Romans 5: 10, 11
C.A.C. I think it is important that we should understand the difference between justification and reconciliation, and particularly with reference to how these great truths would affect us personally.
Ques. "Reconciled to God through the death of his Son" -- how does it work?
C.A.C. It is evident that the death of His Son is what brings it about. I was thinking that many believers as to their relations with God know something of what it is to be justified by faith, and it is professedly the faith of the Protestant part of Christendom, but I doubt whether many have entered into the truth of reconciliation.
Ques. What does the word reconciliation convey to you?
C.A.C. Well, the word obviously suggests that estrangement and distance have come in. If two persons need to be reconciled it is evident that estrangement has existed.
Rem. A person may be justified and yet not happy or at home with God.
C.A.C. To put it quite simply, it seems tome that justification makes me *clear*, but does not necessarily bring me *near*; whereas you cannot conceive of reconciliation except as having the effect of bringing us near. To take a familiar illustration, when God clothed Adam and Eve with coats of skins, they were invested in type with a divine righteousness that could not be improved, but we do not know that it led to nearness.
We have been seeing in the third and fourth chapters and the beginning of the fifth that it is in the mind of God in grace to justify men, so that no sin whatever is or can be imputed to them. It is impossible to lay any charge against a justified man. The challenge is to the universe, "Who shall bring an accusation against God's elect?" (@Romans 8: 33).
{492}
Ques. God had reconciliation in mind for man, but before that he must be justified, would you say?
C.A.C. I think that is right. Justifying in itself does not suggest the thought of nearness. There was no thought of nearness in Adam -- no thought of approach to God. If you might use what follows illustratively, you get in Abel at least a hint of nearness. He brings his offering; there is a proffered movement to God. Cain entirely ignored reconciliation.
Ques. Would the younger son in @Luke 15 illustrate reconciliation?
C.A.C. I think the younger son is the best illustration of it in Scripture. Not only is he self-willed and has he taken his own course, but it has landed him in the place of distance. Not only have I sinned, but my whole state is that of distance from God. And I believe many a person has a sense of distance between him and God; it is a right feeling and there if men's consciences are alive and awake. It seems to me reconciliation meets that.
Rem. The father removes the distance from his own side.
C.A.C. As soon as there was the desire and he returns in mind to his father, he finds there is not an obstacle in the way; it is wonderful! Reconciliation has to be received. None of us are in the good of justification or reconciliation until we are in the faith of it. All the distance between us (which is on our side) God has removed, because He would have us near. God felt the distance with Adam, and God feels it if we are not happy and in nearness. If nearness to God is not my chief joy, God feels it. The same gospel that tells me I am justified, tells me I am reconciled; it is there for me, for faith, if I take it in.
I think it is a dreadful thing when we discover we are enemies, what hard thoughts we have about God and what unwillingness to trust Him -- it is a very serious matter. And reconciliation stands in relation to that. I am in moral distance from God and I have bad thoughts of God, and if so I am an enemy. We have all to find it out.
{493}
Rem. "For we being still without strength, in the due time Christ has died for the ungodly". The whole history of man confirms it.
C.A.C. That is exactly it, and the gospel comes in on that footing. We only know God by the way He has considered for His sinful creature. Mr. Darby has said that the knowledge of God depends upon sin; that is, His moral character is displayed. Reconciliation brings us into the appreciation of God, so that we delight in nearness to Him; that is how I understand it.
Ques. The love of God comes first, then reconciliation; is that the order?
C.A.C. I think so. This epistle lays down the permanent way over which souls have to travel. We may get things in a disjointed way, but sooner or later we have to fall in with God's permanent way.
Rem. The shedding abroad of the love of God in our hearts gives us desires Godward.
C.A.C. And in a sense we could hardly bear the exposure of what we are, unless we had some sense of what God is. "Reconciled to God through the death of his Son" shows how divine love enters into the matter; that is, the love of God did not stop short of any cost, that He might have His creature near to Himself. This all sheds light on how we come to want God.
Ques. Would justification be a step towards this end?
C.A.C. You could hardly say that justification was the divine end; we learn the condition of enmity marking us -- it is not learnt all at once -- and we come to it after a certain preparatory process or we could not bear to recognise what the flesh is. When we discover the enmity, we discover that the condition of things which is characterised by enmity to God *must* be brought to an end. We have the conviction of it, and we see that God has brought it to pass in the death of His Son. It is not an enemy turned into a friend, but he is entirely dismissed.
{494}
Rem. In Colossians the saints seem reconciled.
C.A.C. Colossians shows how the fulness of the Godhead enters into it; every part of the Godhead, we might say, is engaged in this. It is to the fulness of the Godhead -- to nothing less than that.
Ques. Would you explain your remark about an enemy not being made a friend?
C.A.C. It is not that the fallen nature is improved or changed, it is absolutely set aside in the death of God's Son, so that we might understand how we are with God: entirely apart from the whole state of the fallen creature. The point is reached where we are thankful for it, and there is no liberty with God without it; no one can come into the assembly apart from this. Mr. Stoney used to say that many come to the Lord's supper to see for themselves that Goliath's head is really cut off. If we come to express by a public act our identification with His body given and His blood shed, it is His death in view of *nearness*, not justification, that we have before us; so that there is the blessedness of fresh enjoyment of nearness when together.
When we have arrived at the conviction of enmity to God, we are deeply thankful that God has closed it up in the death of His Son, and we do not want to go on one step with the man at enmity. If I sin after I am justified, I am going back to what I have left.
The robe, the ring and the sandals are for nearness -- not for the far country! And as we find we are wholly identified with Christ -- if His death has become a great reality to us, so that the enmity is gone and we are invested in Christ -- we learn more and more of the One we are identified with. We do not learn His preciousness at a distance. In the assembly we speak of Christ and of the Father's love. If we are there in reconciliation, we are blessedly unconscious of anything else.
Ques. What is the reason for the delay in getting into the good of reconciliation?
C.A.C. Well, I think the principal reason is that we are
{495}
slow to accept the lessons that God is teaching us. He has taken us in hand in grace to teach us the most blessed things that are in the thoughts of God. I do not think anything could be more precious to God than the thought of reconciliation.
Rem. The old man has to go for God and for us. Many go on for years in concern over it.
C.A.C. And do you not think always with a certain secret desire to retain something of the flesh? Then we see the cost at which God has effected the complete removal -- it has been costly to God, it cost His Son. "God, having sent his own Son" (@Romans 8: 3) -- it is the cost it has been to God because He wanted us near and in perfect suitability to that nearness.
Rem. Our supreme relation is to be with God.
C.A.C. We have to learn that. There is often a sense in souls that they can trust the Son, but they are not sure about God. Such people have not received the gospel; they may have taken in part of it. It suits us for relations to Christ as Head; all this is preparatory to the headship of Christ being brought out in the latter part of the chapter, and we do not really know our suitability to Christ apart from this.
Ques. What is the force of "making our boast"?
C.A.C. Well, it is a strong word. I think God delights in the exhilaration of heart that His saints find in nearness to Him. It is most exhilarating -- not to the flesh, of course, because the flesh is not there. We begin to see that the Lord Jesus Christ is the peculiar divine avenue through whom all the pure divine grace and thoughts of love have come, that have flowed out to us; He is the blessed Administrator of it. So we see Him glorious, as the One making God known in the full measure of all His thoughts of love for us. It is the exhilaration of soul when the soul comes near to Him and realises it is a positive happiness for God to have us near Him. I think the cup is presented in the Supper in view of nearness. The Lord's death is the ground of nearness and we actually eat and drink it in eating the Supper. My impression
{496}
is that the truth of reconciliation underlies every happy coming together. There may be a measure of relief, but we want a sense of the delight of divine Persons to have us near Them.
Rem. It would help us in our relations as together.
C.A.C. Thank God, the saints do find pleasure in being together; there might be much more of it. In blessing the cup our whole souls delightedly respond to it. It is that the Lord might have a company in nearness to Himself, because He does not want to come in among us at a distance, does He? So the apprehension of this would affect us very much in our relations with divine Persons; it would give us liberty and profound joy, and we should know God better. We always carry with us a humbling sense of what we were and are, but we like to leave that outside when we come together. I cannot imagine the younger son talking about the far country when he was inside, can you? I imagine he was engrossed with his father, his whole boast was in his father. If you had got hold of him that is all you would have got out of him. Well, you do not find too many on that line.
We need to take in this beautiful ministry. Justification and reconciliation are distinctive to Paul. He had the ministry of reconciliation, so he was an ambassador, his business in it was to beseech men to come into this. Saints need continually beseeching to come into the good of it.
Rem. If these things were made attractive to us much earlier, we should enter upon them sooner.
C.A.C. We may get relief in such a way as to stupefy our own exercises. Persons get so much of the gospel as will satisfy them on the relief side and stupefy them for any further exercises. Very often very little is received of what is presented to souls, just enough for the sense of relief, more or less setting aside the moral exercises the Spirit would raise in their souls.
Rem. Reconciliation is the presentation of God's side of things.
C.A.C. Yes.
{497}
Ques. Do Joseph and his brethren illustrate it?
C.A.C. He had said to his brethren, "Come near tome" (@Genesis 45: 4), but they were not in the good of it, because seventeen years afterwards they have to tell lies to be sure they will not be hanged!
Rem. "Through whom now we have received the reconciliation". It is what has been made available, though many of us have not received it.
C.A.C. Well, practically and experimentally we have not, but it is there for us. These things are stated in their absolute perfection; we are so slow to take them in, and all our lives we are learning. Mr. Raven said that the love of God is the last thing we learn; well, I am glad to be in a spot where I can learn it.
Ques. Where is that?
C.A.C. Well, in the presence of the epistle to the Romans. It is *through Him*, the Lord Jesus Christ, and having to do with that wonderful Person -- a risen and glorified Man -- He is the Administrator of it all. If I get near to Him, He will administer it to me. We must be *near* to Him. As we were saying last week, we must be near enough to touch Him to get the value that is in Himself. It is a very practical question, this question of being near to divine Persons. It has been said that we understand the words by the thing -- we have the things. He comes first to us to minister to us, not for us to worship Him. When He says, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you" (@John 14: 18), He is coming to comfort them, to minister, to express all that He is, all that is in His heart, and as the Mediator of what is in the heart of God. He comes near to us to make it a *reality* to us.
Rem. It is good to have the breaking of bread soon in the morning meeting.
C.A.C. It is a very great help if we are led in liberty into the reality of the Lord's body given and His blood poured out, if affection brings us into it, but the great point is nearness. Remembering Him is not nearness.
{498}
NOTES OF A READING
@Romans 5: 12 - 21
C.A.C. God has given all men to know how much can come in by one man, and that should prepare men to understand the gospel.
Ques. You mean how God came in to meet the situation?
C.A.C. Well, it is by introducing another Man, but the very experience of men should prepare them to understand what an immensity of moral results flow from one man.
Ques. Does that apply to both lines?
C.A.C. To the Adam line.
Ques. Does it not apply to the other?
C.A.C. Yes, but we do not begin with the other. Paul does not begin with Christ, but Adam. The first should prepare us for the other. That which is natural comes first, and all mankind has had experience of that. It is a matter of experience by every human being; we have all experienced what has come in by one man.
Rem. Through one man came a scene of lawlessness; through one Man a scene of righteousness can be brought to pass.
Ques. Why is there a break in the epistle just here?
C.A.C. Because he has brought us to the highest point in the eleventh verse -- boasting in God. But then the Spirit of God takes up this great question of headship, and it is most important for all men. Every man, woman and child is involved in the matter. All have come under sin and death, and how have they come under it? By means of the headship of Adam.
Ques. How would you apply it to an unbeliever?
C.A.C. I should like him to realise first of all what the headship of Adam resulted in. If he refused it, I should have
{499}
nothing more to say to him. He *cannot* refuse it -- that he has come under sin and under death; and it is all traceable to Adam who was fallen before he took up his headship. He is perhaps the most remarkable type of Christ in the Scriptures, "the figure of him to come"; that is, in the very fact that he was head of a race and transmitted certain consequences to every member of his race, he is a figure of Christ.
Ques. This is working out things on the principle of headship?
C.A.C. Is it possible for *anyone* to understand the gospel unless they understand headship?
Ques. What does the acknowledgment of the headship of Christ involve?
C.A.C. Any human being realising what he has come into as under the headship of Adam would be extremely concerned as to the raising of the question whether there is any possibility for him to come under any other headship. Headship should be presented to men. It is by both Peter and Paul. Peter preached, "God has made him ... both Lord and Christ" (@Acts 2: 36) -- Lord and Head. Paul too. The great act of favour on God's part is that He has brought in another Head, and we ought to tell that to men very plainly in the gospel.
Rem. John the Baptist said, "The axe is applied to the root of the trees" (@Luke 3: 9).
C.A.C. And he spoke of a coming One for whom he was preparing. The One he heralded would cause men to be vitally linked up to Himself; He baptised with the Holy Spirit.
It is most important to see that God's great act of favour shall be "as the offence" (verse 15). That is, the act of favour has as wide a bearing as the offence on all the thousands of millions of the human race, on the whole human race, and no one can get out of it, or deny it, if he is in his senses. God, being what He is, is not content to let things rest there, with His creatures under sin and death. It is all reconciled under
{500}
another Head. It is another one Man, and God would concentrate our thoughts on that one Man -- a new Head in place of Adam.
Ques. "The act of favour" -- does it involve the death of Christ?
C.A.C. I think it does, and the accomplishment of righteousness, all that was brought to pass in the death of Christ. The presence of the Lord on earth without His dying -- He might have gone back to glory -- would have been the condemnation of everybody, because it would be manifest that all men were utterly unlike Him.
So that "one righteousness" which we get lower down (verse 18) is most important. There is "one man" and "one righteousness". It no doubt refers to His death and all that was accomplished there for the glory of God.
Rem. "The offence of one" referred to Adam's sin, all were tainted by the same sinful condition.
C.A.C. Yes, clearly. In contrast to that we get the grace of God and the free gift in grace, and it has abounded to the many. God made Himself known through grace, despite the very conditions that man was in, and showed His grace was greater than man's sin.
Rem. "Where sin abounded grace has overabounded".
C.A.C. Yes, that is a lovely word. If God has been defeated, He is not God at all! God has done something more wonderful than stopping all the evil of men: He has brought in this new Head, in whom His grace is perfectly set forth. Mr. Raven said you could speak to any man in the street and ask whether he had answered to his Head, because it is by divine appointment. God has brought in a Head for man in place of Adam who lost his title to it, and Christ has it. Men turn away from the favour of God and all God has in His heart to give, if they refuse Him. It is all there, it cannot be denied! Why should I refuse to believe what is so blessed -- that God is favourable to me? O! it is wonderful; the more I think of the gospel, the more wonderful it is to me. There is
{501}
the perfect favour of God shining out in Jesus Christ -- it is *there*.
Ques. Is the reason why we are so slow to enjoy our privileges, that we do not see this truth?
C.A.C. Our hearts are most averse to taking in what God really is; we are very slow to do so, but it is there to be taken in! God has brought in this new Head and provided the gift of righteousness.
Rem. It all has the setting of a gift.
C.A.C. That is how God is presenting Himself, and all that is needed for man and to make him happy, He is willing to provide on the principle of gift. And God works in certain souls to make them appreciative of it.
Rem. "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water" (@John 4: 10).
Rem. The woman in @Luke 7 gladly takes up the new position under Christ.
C.A.C. She greatly appreciated the creditor. The element of self-righteousness is in our flesh and it stands in the light of all God is in His light, in our souls. He is dealing with His creature on the principle of gift. "The free gift of righteousness", it says. Every man's heart ought to be touched that God has provided this free righteousness, when he had none of his own.
Rem. We are more inclined to think of Christ than of being brought to God; it is to bring us to God.
C.A.C. It is so, and *must* be so; there would be no Christ at all but for the free giving of God. His presence here and death on the cross are all entirely of God. When we see the favourableness of God towards us it is astonishing to a sinner, and very hard to take in.
Rem. The chapter brings in the thought of sin. God has lost man and is recovering him.
C.A.C. He has undertaken to do everything, to remove
{502}
everything in the way of His creature's blessing, and He has the free gift of righteousness, so that he may be set up in righteousness perfectly before God.
As unbelievers we practically exhibited we were under the headship of Adam, because at that time we ignored the new headship. It is for men to understand this, whether they believe or not. God has introduced this new Head. If their eyes are open to the gain of it they receive it; you cannot think of anyone seeing it without receiving it. See all that has come in by Him! Men close their eyes to it. God is doing all He can to open men's eyes to see it. Satan blinds their eyes. "In whom the god of this world has blinded the thoughts of the unbelieving" (@2 Corinthians 4: 4). Christ is there in His headship for every human being. His headship is on the line of blessing, what is available to His creature on that line. His headship here is entirely on the line of blessing, the fulness of grace and blessing that is in Him as the divinely appointed Head.
Ques. Is this to demonstrate the attitude of God to men at the present time?
C.A.C. You can preach Christ, that all grace and blessing come through Him and are found in Him, whether men are interested or not. You would like to make them interested, would you not? The gospel brings out the state of man as nothing else does; for if God is revealed in grace and truth, and declared from the bosom of the Father, and men are unmoved, it shows the terrible state of the fallen creature. Verse 16 shows the act of favour is of many offences unto justification -- that though men on their part have many offences, the act of favour provides justification for them. God is the Justifier, He is that for all men. There is a beautiful note to justification: 'It is the state of accomplished subsisting righteousness before God, in which justification places us'. That is very fine. Justification places us in a position of accomplished subsisting righteousness, the fruit of the death of Christ. It can never be changed or
{503}
modified; and that is the status in which the believer is placed before God. The righteousness of the believer is not a changeable thing at all.
Ques. "Justification" and "justification of life" -- what is the distinction between the two?
C.A.C. One is the fruit of God's justifying grace, and the other is the result of deliverance. That is, he speaks of reigning in life -- you are no longer under bondage to sin, Satan's power or the law. The believer reigns in life through Jesus Christ; he is set in the supremacy of life. He receives the abundance of grace, and of the free gift of righteousness, he is set up in all the wealth of grace, and the result of that is there is a reigning in life by Jesus Christ. But in order to get that practically there must be the working out of the next three chapters.
Ques. Why is there the absence of the Spirit still? It is not said to be in the power of the Spirit, I mean.
C.A.C. He has spoken of the Spirit earlier in the chapter; what he is dwelling upon is what is administered through the Lord Jesus Christ; and if we see the wealth of the supremacy of grace, we are in the enjoyment. A man in the sense of God's supremacy of grace would never lose his temper. If he does, it is because he has got out of it, and that is more serious than losing his temper. When we are in the gain of the grace administered by the one Man, we do not sin. Such a man is lifted into a region far above the level where sin moves -- he has justification of life. It is a life that cannot be changed with sin; and that is the life of the believer. "For we all often offend", as James says -- we all know it. It is a shame for a believer to sin. In order to be in the supremacy of life you need deliverance from sin and the law and the flesh. The power of it all is the joy of grace. If we lost it we should be in bondage. If in the joy of grace we shall not give place to the flesh; it is a thing we are ashamed of, we do not want to gratify it in any way. Reigning in life is a position of supremacy, and justification of life is that there is nothing seen in a
{504}
believer that is not suitable to a justified man. If I sin I am contradicting the whole position. I am saying I am without a spot with God, and bringing in many spots. Justification of life is a life unchangeable with sin. "Which of you convinces me of sin?", the Lord said (@John 8: 46). We do not want to say we do not walk as He did. The natural result of being justified by faith and by blood etc. is justification of life; it is a practical thing showing what justification brings about. Paul was good outwardly but had to learn what was in his flesh; we all have to learn, however nice we are outwardly, that we belong to Adam -- that miserable stock! We need to *keep* our souls in the sense of grace, and all that is unfolded in these chapters, because if we get away from it we have no power to stand against our own flesh or the world. And this is God's thought for all men -- not only believers -- that they should be delivered from the power of sin and move on the line of righteousness; and He has brought in His own righteousness that we might be practically righteous.
Then the last verse, "So also grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord". That is, it brings us into the spiritual joy of the believer, because eternal life is looked at here as the blessing of the gospel. So the kingdom of God is "righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit" -- all this now. And as we move on these lines in righteousness in a practical sense, there is the enjoyment of blessing outside the reign of sin and death, and we enjoy it particularly when together.
{505}
NOTES OF A READING
@Romans 5: 18 - 21; @Romans 6: 1 - 14
C.A.C. I think it would be good if the brethren said a little more about the "one righteousness" and the "obedience of the one", and particularly as it would appear that these things are the basis of what follows in the epistle.
Ques. What is involved in "one righteousness"?
C.A.C. Well, I thought it related to all that had come in by the first "one man" It is clearly in contrast to the "one offence". The one offence had its bearing towards all and resulted in condemnation, but the one great act of righteousness has been accomplished.
Ques. Would that be the death of Christ?
C.A.C. I thought it referred to what was accomplished on the cross. It does not say, one obedience, it is "the obedience of the one" which leaves room for the introduction of the whole obedience of Christ.
Ques. Would "becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of the cross" (@Philippians 2: 8) be the whole obedience?
C.A.C. Yes. It seems to me the "one righteousness" clears everything that came in by the first man to the perfect satisfaction of God and to His glory; but "the obedience of the one" brings in all that is perfect and positively delightful to God.
Rem. The whole principle of sin will be eradicated from God's universe, leaving righteousness as the foundation of blessing.
C.A.C. Yes. God would call our attention and the attention of all men to the "one righteousness", because it is towards all men. God would have all men to be interested in it.
Rem. Death came in as the penalty of offences, and so life came in as the answer to righteousness.
{506}
C.A.C. It is remarkable that is in view, showing what the effect will be if we take right account of the "one righteousness", so that we have changed our headship. I suppose all present have changed their headship, and if so we come in for all the value of what is connected with the new Head.
Ques. Is there any distinction between this righteousness and that in the third chapter -- "righteousness of God"?
C.A.C. It is not quite the same thing, as far as I understand. "Righteousness of God" stands in contrast to any righteousness of men. It is a righteousness that is revealed, purely of God, and made available through infinite grace for men who had none. God provides a righteousness altogether of Himself. But this righteousness is one definite act, standing alone, and it is our great lesson-book in regard to everything that came in by Adam.
Ques. Is it by this one righteousness that the righteousness of God has become available to those that believe?
C.A.C. Well, I think the matter is looked at here in its practical moral effect; that is, those who learn the import of the one righteousness see that all that came in by the first man has been fully judged to the satisfaction and glory of God. Sins are judged, sin condemned, the penalty borne, and God intends we should come into line with that; and so we arrive at this great terminus, "justification of life". That is, we do not go on with one single thing that God has judged by that one act of righteousness. We have to judge everything in the light of it; there is no moral recovery to God until we do. It is a stupendous thing morally to be set in the light of that one act of righteousness so that we come into line with that one act of righteousness accomplished by our one Head. We see that everything that is distasteful and abhorrent to us has been judged by that one righteousness; and the practical result is that those who come into the light of it cannot go on with what they have judged. None of us does. Justification of life is the end in view.
{507}
Rem. "Leading captive every thought into the obedience of the Christ" (@2 Corinthians 10: 5).
C.A.C. Yes, that goes on to the positive side, "the obedience of the one". All that Adam brought in has been dealt with by "one righteousness" to God's perfect satisfaction and therefore to ours.
Ques. Would you explain being "constituted righteous"?
C.A.C. That is most important, because the negative side alone would not set us up, the consciousness of being divinely cleared of what Adam brought in. Our Head has not only dealt with that, but every element pleasing to God has been brought in by Him. He has filled it up in perfection, and as having a vital link with Him we are constituted righteous. Our link with Adam constituted us sinners -- a very real thing -- but by the obedience of the One many are constituted righteous. The believer as having changed his head receives impressions from Christ, and this obedience brought in by Him enters into every fibre of his being and constitutes him righteous.
Rem. "If any one be in Christ, there is a new creation" (@2 Corinthians 5: 17).
C.A.C. Yes, surely. This is a positive principle which is delightful to God and a perfect contrast to Adam; and as we look up with reverence and affection to Christ as Head we derive from Him. So no believer thus is happy except as moving on the line of obedience. What makes us miserable is doing our own will.
In the new creation all things are of God. The old things have passed away and all things are of God. It is an order of things viewed abstractly where everything is of God, and we are privileged to view such a condition of things. But here it is a moral reality. Our link with Christ is according to grace, and it is more real than our link with Adam.
Rem. The thief on the cross had 'changed his man'.
C.A.C. The thief morally parted with himself, for he
{508}
says, "*We* indeed justly, ... but this man has done nothing amiss" -- he changed over. So he became the solitary witness at Calvary that stood out in clear distinct testimony to Christ; there was no one else at that moment.
Ques. Do we take a definite stand here that we have changed our man?
C.A.C. Well, there is no other way of being constituted righteous but by coming under the headship of Christ so that we become affected by it, and we take character from Him as the obedient One. It is a moral change, not merely that the believer is counted righteous. So the obedience of the One covers His whole life from the manger to the cross. The new principle of obedience was carried through to perfection, and there was no way in which it could shine in which it did not shine -- of course it includes His death.
Rem. It has been said that Adam was greater after the fall than in innocence.
C.A.C. That is so, because Adam was invested in what could not be spoiled, nothing could spoil the coats of skin. These great matters lie at the foundation of all that follows in these chapters. They are worked out in detail in the next three chapters. I think chapter 5 presents things from the divine side, and shows the divine intent -- justification of life and our being practically righteous; that is, man is recovered to God in the place where he was so dishonouring to God. It is not taking him to heaven.
Ques. Would you explain "justification of life"?
C.A.C. I think it is that the life of the believer as having come under the headship of Christ takes on such a character that no charge can be brought against him. It is a moral result reached, and not perhaps reached in five minutes (in the actual working out of the thing he requires to go through chapters 6, 7 and 8), but it is the divine end.
Ques. Is it a right to live?
C.A.C. Yes, I think so; no charge can be brought against him. Of course it is the work of God, like Balaam's answer to
{509}
the charge against Israel, "What hath God wrought!" -- not "thought"; and what He will effect in Israel, and in His saints *now* as far as they have come under the reign of grace, is the result of the kingdom of God. It is possible for it to be reached in the assembly now. Fancy the grace of God bringing us under a Head in whom obedience has been worked out in perfection! You can see how believers are viewed as having died to sin. They have seen it exemplified in obedience in Christ, and they have passed over to that side of things; morally they have parted with sin. If a believer sins he knows he has got away altogether from the true place where grace has set him; and he goes down into the dust and breaks his heart over it. It is only as this is brought to fruition that we are really recovered to God in the place where we dishonoured Him. It is the end in view. We want to see that it is *now* that we are to be in the justification of life; nobody should be able to lay a finger on a spot. It means I am judging everything that God has judged in that one act of righteousness. When we come to the actual working out of it we all feel rather small. Grace teaches us to live "soberly, and justly, and piously in the present course of things" (@Titus 2: 12), and there is no room there for sin! And God is working for His own standard, to secure His pleasure; and it is a greater thing that He should secure it now than that He should secure it in heaven where there is no world or sin or flesh to oppose. After being in it all in Adam, we get clear of it all by our link with Christ.
In this way all the hindrances are eliminated that prevent us from enjoying eternal life.
Rem. Perhaps some of us are perplexed as to eternal life, what it is!
C.A.C. I dare say we are: we had better go in for it!
Ques. Is it the conscious enjoyment of the knowledge of God?
C.A.C. Yes, and undisturbed by sin. We are living in the enjoyment of what came in by Christ.
{510}
Rem. "This is the eternal life, that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent" (@John 17: 3).
C.A.C. And there is no room for sin there. The believer, brought outside the sphere of sin by the link with Christ and giving his new Head His right place, is unhampered. Eternal life is the crowning thing in the kingdom.
Ques. Can it be touched individually?
C.A.C. I think we might touch it on an occasion like this; we might touch it in abstraction for a minute or two outside the sphere of sin and death. John is rather particular to use the singular number in speaking of eternal life; it is always 'he' (he does not say 'they'), showing it can be enjoyed individually and enjoyed as the divinely given portion of a number. It is the same thing with sonship.
All this underlies being "dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus". So the question is raised, Are we to continue in sin? Paul will not hear of such a thing. No saint on earth would hear of such a thing! How could he, having got clear of the whole sphere of sin by the death of Christ? It is not anything in ourselves. If I have part in the death of Christ I am saved from the whole sphere in which sin operates. He was in that sphere, though He knew not sin and in Him sin was not; He died to it, and I believe in that sense His death was a relief to Him. "For he that has died is justified from sin". You cannot charge with sin a man who is dead.
Rem. We can do the same.
C.A.C. Is that not the thought? Christ has died to sin; all His links with the sphere of sin are gone. "In that he has died, he has died to sin once for all; but in that he lives, he lives to God" -- so we are to the pleasure of God in the life of another Man. He simply defines the christian position without any explanation. We often have so many explanations that we darken counsel by words without knowledge (@Job 38: 2). It is good to see that we have been baptised to Christ and to His death, so as to have part in Christ and in His
{511}
death; and outside of that we have nothing at all, so we had better come into it!
Rem. To be baptised to Moses in the cloud and in the sea would mean we accept it.
C.A.C. Yes, and to accept it as the blessed truth of God. So as to the life we formerly lived we are buried, we are as finished with it as if we were actually buried, and all we have to think of is the will of God -- you cannot have any mixed position. I suppose nearly all of us have to learn the truth of it long after our baptism. It is burial with Him unto death so that as Christ was raised up from among the dead by the glory of the Father, we also should walk in newness of life. So there is something of the glory of the Father about every believer walking in newness of life.
Ques. Why is it "the Father" -- not 'God'?
C.A.C. All the actings of grace are on the line of the enjoyment and satisfaction of God and His saints. It is like a little bit of John dropped down into Paul. It sets forth the extreme pleasure of the Father to take Him out of the place where He had gone in obedience. The Father's love embraces Him and takes Him out. And that is the pattern for the believer. In chapter 6 He is the pattern for us, the divine pattern for men. I am to walk in newness of life patterned by His resurrection.
Ques. Is that why it is "Jesus Christ" in chapter 5 and "Christ Jesus" in chapter 6?
C.A.C. Yes, the fifth chapter is evidently the last Adam -- the new Head; in the sixth it is the second Man -- it is the pattern.
{512}
NOTES OF A READING
@Romans 6: 1 - 14
C.A.C. We have had before us the thought of the glorious Head that has been provided for man by God's great act of favour, and we have seen that those who believe on Him come into the gain of what is administered by Him and are brought to reign in life and have justification of life, and to be constituted righteous. All that is the truth on the positive side -- the positive gain and result of the headship of Christ. Then these great actings of grace necessarily involve a complete severance from the principle of evil brought in by Adam; so we learn now that the relation of the believer to sin is that he is dead to it.
Ques. What would be the thought of "dead to sin"?
C.A.C. Well, it certainly indicates a complete severance from it, so complete that it could only be adequately set forth by death.
Rem. It says, "identified with him". Verse 10 says, "He has died to sin once for all", after it has said we have died to sin. The fact that He has died to it makes it possible for us.
C.A.C. If Christ had not died we should have had no title to separate ourselves from what came in by our former head. The death of Christ is our title to take this ground, and Christians under the reign of grace do take this ground, that they have died to sin. The ground of it was brought before us in a striking way in our baptism.
We come to it under divine instruction, rather than by the exercise of our souls. We take it up as divinely instructed in our affections. People think it is a matter of exercise. Exercise for a thousand years would not bring us to it, whereas instructed affection can come to it at once. People exercise themselves for years instead of understanding the economy of grace which brings everything to them by grace, and that now they have to obey from the heart what they have been instructed in. It all turns on verse 17 -- "Thanks
{513}
be to God, that ye were bondmen of sin, but have obeyed from the heart the form of teaching into which ye were instructed". That is one of the greatest things God could bring us into, so that our affections could be instructed so as to learn our relation to Christ and to sin -- *there is no exercise in it*. What I see in the early chapters of Romans is nothing else but divine light and instruction brought into the human soul, so that God may be known -- no exercise but all divine light. It is the economy of grace unfolded in divine power, unfolded not only for justification, but deliverance. We know many souls are hung up for years, they are not obedient. Heart-obedience to divine instruction is worth all the experience in the world put together.
Ques. Otherwise it depends on oneself, you mean?
C.A.C. Exactly. I well remember the laborious and puzzling exercises I went through before I was prepared for heart-obedience to divine instruction. "Ye ... have obeyed from the heart". It is a heart matter. This is not a mass of doctrine as some people think, all this truth about the Head and the wonderful things that come in by Him in divine completeness; nothing is lacking in it -- it cannot be improved or added to. It is all a matter of obedience to divine instruction, so as to bring deliverance from sin and freedom from the law and the flesh. When it comes in, all exercises are at an end.
The apostle Paul is a good illustration. He got the greatest possible light, nothing could be more glorious than the light that shone on him. He learnt all the truth of the gospel and the assembly in one blaze of light, and he learned in light in one minute more than he could have learned in a thousand years of experience.
Romans shows you the structure of grace in the soul of the believer that qualifies him for the assembly; that is why he indicates later on that he has much more to say. It is very evident to us all that if we have obeyed from the heart the divine instruction, we have come in our affections under the new Head; and the great point is that we should come in our affections under the personal influence of the new Head.
{514}
Ques. Why is it we are so slow to receive divine light?
C.A.C. To put it simply we have preferred to circle round ourselves rather than attend to objective thoughts of God in Christ. You will not make any progress that way. You go on circling round till one day a blaze of light brings God before you in Christ and you see the lines on which the Spirit is moving and it commands your affections, and that is how you come into deliverance. I know no better way.
This whole matter is really determined in relation to our baptism. The man who baptised us understood the relation; we did not. That is, the only ground that is right for a child of Adam to be on according to grace is identification with Christ in His death. On account of the terrible conditions that had come in, it was a necessity for men to be put on another ground, that of Christ and His death, and baptism is the expression of it. The disobedient man cannot be retained in God's system of grace, he *must* be buried. This death upon man as a sinner has been taken up by the blessed God in grace: Christ has been in it, and it is our title to sever ourselves entirely from the fallen and disobedient man. We are not fit for the assembly otherwise. The privilege of the assembly is identification with Christ in life; well, we could not know that if we are not dead with Him. As Lord He administers all that there is in Him as Head.
Ques. They were baptised to Moses in the cloud and in the sea, is that as head?
C.A.C. Yes, the fifth chapter is the cloud and the sixth chapter is the sea. We can only be baptised once, there is no going back to Egypt; they could not go back through the Red Sea for it is one-way traffic there! There is no need to repeat baptism; it puts you on a certain ground and that permanently. It is most important for us to see that according to grace our links with the fallen and disobedient man are *severed* for ever and never to be resumed -- it is a matter of divine instruction, it is very much greater than experience.
Rem. "Buried" would mean forever finished.
C.A.C. The man really which is buried does not come up
{515}
again. The man who comes up is a new man who walks in relation to Christ, in newness of life. He is the divinely appointed Head. It is God's will made known and I come into it by my affections being carried by it. We do not need more light, but our hearts touched. There are many things you can only learn by divine light coming into the soul and liberating the affections. With believers who have come under the headship of Christ there is the Spirit as well as faith. The instruction is received on the principle of faith in the power of the Spirit. Faith is the light of God in the soul of man. What could be greater than to have the light of God and of Christ as Head, and deliverance from sin and from law, and to be in the supremacy of life in regard to the flesh; can you think of anything better for the creature? I can go to God as having His light for our blessing in my soul carrying my affections, so that I am in the mind of God in my own soul, seeing as He does, and that delights Him. There is often a mixed condition actually, as we sometimes say, a dissolving view, the new coming, but the old not quite gone.
"With" occurs five times in verses 4 - 8, the word of identification. Grace entitles every one of us brought to the faith of Christ to take up our identification with Him and live in the secret of our hearts with God -- it is deliverance from the sphere of sin. The real secret of it is the new birth that has been effected in every soul that believes in Christ -- a divine operation in the soul that manifested itself in faith that brought divine light into the soul. All that is done in me has the light of the new Head in view, that I should come into it. God's thought is that the fallen man, all that is morally connected with fallen Adam, shall disappear. The person that baptised you put you on the ground of the death of Christ; you have to come to it afterwards. I was baptised because I saw it in Scripture and that it was the right thing to be done. And so it is with many, but it is not entering into the import of it! The eunuch apprehended in a spiritual manner the import of the death of Jesus.
Ques. Is it a different man as well as a different ground?
{516}
C.A.C. Of course it is. It means that the disobedient man is to disappear morally with every one of us. It would not be worthy of God -- it would not be like God to leave him in evidence. Therefore the judgment of the disobedient man has been borne by the obedient Man, so that all the features of the disobedient man disappear.
"Our old man" is the man connected with Adam. It is the whole body of sin -- not members not correcting this detail or that. The whole man must go, and be replaced by the features of the obedient Man.
Ques. Is that why it says, "And ... was buried" (@1 Corinthians 15: 4)?
C.A.C. Yes. It was the fulfilment of the original sentence, "Dust thou art; and unto dust shalt thou return" (@Genesis 3: 19), and that thought is in burial, man going back to earth whence he was taken. The Lord went into the heart of the earth; it was for our sakes. That means if we are buried with Him by baptism unto death it is that that man who needed to be put out of sight disappears. What is to be seen in this marvellous newness of life which stands in relation to Christ. We let ourselves off by talking about our failures and shortcomings and say we often break down -- well, that will not get us anywhere!
Ques. Is it connected with putting on the new man?
C.A.C. I think it involves the putting off of the old man and the putting on of the new man, because it is a matter of instruction there (in Ephesians), the truth as it is in Jesus; "If ye have heard him and been instructed in him according as the truth is in Jesus; namely your having put off ... the old man ... and your having put on the new man" (@Ephesians 4: 21 - 24). It is the instruction Christ gives me and will tell me -- not in my head, but in my heart.
So that this newness of life is all in relation to Christ, and everyone who knows anything about it is delighted it is so. You will be filled with the blessedness of it all the time! It is for lack of this that we are full of our miserable failures.
{517}
Rem. "Even as Christ has been raised up from among the dead by the glory of the Father, so *we* also should walk in newness of life".
C.A.C. Is it not perfectly beautiful? And newness of life is magnified in glory because it is like Christ. What a satisfaction to the Father to have Him outside the range of sin and death for ever! So he says, "Raised up ... by the glory of the Father". Well, that is the pattern of your walking in newness of life, "so *we* also should walk in newness of life", so that in the end nothing might be seen but God and the glory of God; it is the portion of faith.
Rem. Burial does not come in till after resurrection is brought in. Sarah is buried in @Genesis 23.
C.A.C. You could not have such a chapter as @Romans 6 in the Old Testament. It had to wait till Christ had died, was buried, had risen and ascended to the right hand of God before it could be written.
Ques. Why is it "if" in verse 5?
C.A.C. To show the moral connection; that is, it is a necessity that we should be identified with Him in the likeness of His death, if we are to be in the likeness of His resurrection. You cannot have the one without the other, it is on that ground. If we have not died with Him, we cannot live with Him. So if we have not died with Christ we have no right to talk of christian blessing at all. Living with Him stretches out right on through the assembly and to eternity.
Rem. What has taken place in Christ becomes our lesson book for our instruction.
Ques. Does verse 11 bring in the thought of obedience?
C.A.C. Yes, I think it is taken up in heart-obedience; all these things are taken up in our affections. We might know this chapter by heart, but that does not give it to us. So the reckoning is taken up. I think it is illustrated by what Ittai said to David when the royal city was in rebellion, "Surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be" (@2 Samuel 15: 21). He took
{518}
up his relations with David in affection, and we have to. Then Mephibosheth paid no attention to himself, his heart had gone over with David. We have not done so literally, the only way we can go over is in our affections.
Ques. Would you say something about Christ living to God?
C.A.C. Well, I do not know enough about it to say much. What I see in it is this, that He had entirely ceased to have any contact with the scene of sin and death, for they were abhorrent to God. He laid down His life. He lives to God, the Pattern of that mighty host that will live to God under His headship. He is not only Head but Pattern; the whole heavenly company will be patterned by Him. God has His thought in fruition in a glorified Man in heaven this minute, it is all in substance in Him. To think that we are able to say we are alive to God in Him -- it is enough to take your breath away!
Think of all this being brought in as divine instruction in order to regulate us in our everyday life and regulate our members. It is the inward secret not talked about by the believer, but his everyday practical life is governed by all these precious things he has in secret with God. All is to be regulated in the believer's life by divine instruction, and if so, what sort of a man should a Christian be? Every detail would be regulated practically in his life at home or in his business. So you do not let sin reign in your mortal flesh, nor let your members be instruments to sin. The believer is a self-controlled person, so that not one of his members becomes an instrument to sin.
Some people think this chapter is all about the flesh. We must not confound it with the eighth chapter. It is not about the flesh. We come to the flesh in the eighth chapter. This is a greater, a universal question, that principle of evil that came into the world by one man, for which Christ died. It is looked at in a certain sense as external to the believer, and he does not admit its power at all.
{519}
NOTES OF A READING
@Romans 6: 11 - 23
C.A.C. I suppose we have all noticed that from this point in the epistle believers are viewed as capable of taking charge of themselves. It is important to the understanding of this section of the epistle, really beginning at verse 12. It is surely consequent upon the reckoning, and upon all the previous instruction of the epistle, but the point is reached when the believer is viewed as taking charge of himself, of his mortal body and of his members.
Rem. I feel I have not reached it!
C.A.C. Well, you had better go back to chapter 3. You cannot *begin* the christian life at all unless you are competent to take charge of yourself.
Ques. What is the power for it?
C.A.C. The whole economy of grace is the power; it is the presentation of the whole economy of grace in the previous chapters which ensures liberty to all who come into it, and they become competent. We have seen a large ship tugged out into the main stream, and the cables are thrown off and she goes off under her own steam. The tugs have been at work here; the ministry of the glad tidings with justification, reconciliation and all the wealth of the new Head; it is like being tugged out into the main stream. Now you must go on under your own steam. The Spirit is there no doubt, but He is in the background, it is not consistent that He should be prominent here. The whole economy of grace is in view and the whole effect on those who come under it. You are no longer under law, but under grace.
Rem. I still have some difficulty on the competency, what our resource is.
C.A.C. Well, we have not read the three previous chapters; there we are brought to all the blessedness of God
{520}
in Christ. What is the good of being a Christian if not set up in divine resources? We get it in chapters 3 - 5. The Lord is very pleased when He can trust us with our bodies and our members. No man had more honour from the Lord than the man out of whom He cast the legion of demons. When he asked to be with Him, He told him to go to his own house and show how great things God had done to him. He looked at him as perfectly competent to go single-handed into that district of ten cities. The Lord loves to trust us so that we can take charge of our bodies. So that our members are to be instruments of righteousness. We are never to use them to do anything in which they are not instruments of righteousness. It is quite certain that no one could come under the reign of grace and be incompetent.
Rem. Of Christ it says He died to sin once for all, and of us that "sin shall not have dominion over you". It is a new sphere, where you are under grace and not law.
C.A.C. As we have been seeing, Christ is the pattern in this chapter. It is like the second Man, and the Christian is identified with Him. And there is no other way to have blessing at all but by identification with Christ and His death. What would you think of a man who said he was a Christian, and could not hold his body for God; what would you think of him? Not much! The key, as we were saying last week, to all the teaching here is, "Ye ... have obeyed from the heart the form of teaching into which ye were instructed". The man is secured in his inward being, his affections are secured for it.
Ques. Is the difficulty our slowness to take in the "in Christ" position?
C.A.C. It lies at the back of much of our weakness. You must have your own secret with Him. All about being dead with Christ -- it is your secret, it is inside, nobody knows about it. And living with Him -- it is your secret. All that it is in its moral import is faith's secret.
{521}
But when you come to holding your mortal body it is not secret, it is a public thing. "Your mortal body", he says, to make us sure that he has spoken of present conditions. The secret of it is that it is "to God"; that is, it is God's part in the matter.
Ques. That allows the thought of practical experience?
C.A.C. Christians mix divine instruction with experience, and it does not enter into divine teaching. Instruction is what is true of God, what is brought to us through Christ, and what is true of the new Head. We are able to produce in these mortal bodies what is pleasurable to God -- a most wonderful thing. We are here set up in the wealth of grace and placed under the influence of the divinely appointed Head so that there should be a result for God in our members: our eyes, our ears, our hands, etc.
Rem. "How ye ought to walk and please God ... that ye would abound still more" (@1 Thessalonians 4: 1).
C.A.C. It is a kind of thing in which there is a possibility of increase, but it is a primary thing that the mortal body should not come under the reign of sin. And that is *my* business, it is not God's business. We often expect God to do things that He expects us to do for Him. That hangs us up, for He is waiting for us to make a move. My body and my members are to be recovered for God; if it does not begin there, it does not begin at all. It is a question as to how far we are alive. Am I alive? is the point for each one of us to face, so that God can take account of me as a living person. We are to present ourselves to God alive from among the dead. There is a mass of death in this world and out of that comes up a living person. It was a great delight to the father when he said, "Was dead and has come to life again".
Ques. In baptism are there the two thoughts -- death and leadership?
C.A.C. That is very blessed. It is important to note that when he says, "Yield yourselves to God as alive [an important
{522}
word] from among the dead", it is not a continuous process at all. The note in the Darby Translation to verse 3 says, 'Let it have been done as a once accomplished act'.
Ques. Is that particularly where our weakness lies -- the lack of definiteness on our part?
C.A.C. Arising from not understanding what a pleasure it is to God that we should be here for His pleasure.
Ques. Is there a definite point when we come to it?
C.A.C. Yes, there is a point when this yielding takes place. It is something the soul does; it is what *we* have to do; and do do if we understand the grace of the two previous chapters. It is a very beautiful thought, this thought of yielding. As Mr. Darby said long ago, God sets you absolutely free; now, what are you going to do?
Ques. Is Lydia an illustration?
C.A.C. Yes, there was a yielding of her house to God for His service. How soon the Philippian jailor learnt to take charge of his own body -- he did it right away, and used it in the service of God. He washed the apostles¬ stripes and laid a table for them. You cannot add to the immensity of the grace unfolded in chapters 3 - 5. You cannot add to any of it, you cannot possibly add to the wealth that has come to us through the new Head. It is bound to produce some practical result in the way we hold our bodies.
Ques. Why is the word "bondmen" used (verses 18, 19)?
C.A.C. The apostle shrinks from saying bondage. He says practically, I only say this because you are so dull. In one sense there is no getting out of it -- out of the obligation. He talks of the new sort of bondage -- you cannot get out of it.
Rem. It is the bondage of love.
C.A.C. It is what is due to God -- not entirely voluntary. Yielding is out of voluntary affection, it is due to God, and the sense of obligation under grace is very important. I think it is preparatory to chapter 12. These chapters 6 - 8 are the unfolding of what it is to reign in life. The believer is set up
{523}
in the very place of sin and death in the supremacy of life, and the first evidence of it is that he yields his body to God and his members as instruments of righteousness to God. "Instruments" is an active idea; he does not say "vessels", which is rather a passive idea.
Rem. It is what Paul speaks of in @1 Corinthians 9.
C.A.C. Paul was not gratifying or pampering his body, but bringing it under. It is as if he would say, 'If I was living like you I should expect to go to hell'; that is the truth of it. All that came in in chapter 3 is the result of all that came in in the first man; the effect of being connected with Christ comes out here. The gospel is the great power by which God secures it, because he tells us he preached it for the obedience of faith. There is no such thing as having faith without obedience, and if obedience is there, a man is recovered for God and the features of Christ have begun in him.
Rem. It is a triumph for God to have it in testimony now.
C.A.C. He notes every feature. He took particular notice of a man praying for the first time -- there was a bit of Christ there. Ananias might safely go to such a man as that. And so it is with the first movement of what is right; every little bit of surrender under the influence of grace is very pleasing to God -- a person turning away from some gratification he pursued. There is nothing right apart from the principle of obedience, that is, coming under the influence of the obedience of the One; and those who do are constituted righteous. Those connected with Adam were constituted sinners, and it is just as real in the one case as it was in the other.
Ques. Why does it say, "unto holiness"?
C.A.C. It is a very attractive little touch, to assure us that as we move on the line of righteousness we shall make progress towards holiness. There is nothing more attractive. It is very attractive to the inward man. Holiness means that one should have the same kind of intuitive abhorrence of evil that God has. One act of lawlessness leads to another act of
{524}
lawlessness, but righteousness leads to holiness and the end eternal life. Holiness is very attractive to saints. Satan knows this and so he works on that intuitive desire, that is in all those born anew, and would direct them from the real thing to something that is only the imitation.
In @Hebrews 12 we are said to be not only holy, but "partaking of his holiness". We could not think of God having sons who were not partakers of that feature; holiness is an essential feature of sonship.
As we lay hold of the promises (@2 Peter 1: 4) they bring us into the practical knowledge of God, and that results in our being partakers of the divine nature. Holiness is a deeper thing than righteousness. There is one righteousness, and in that one righteousness everything has been judged that is contrary to God. Holiness is more connected with God's nature, righteousness is connected with His attributes.
Ques. Why does he raise these questions so frequently in these sections; is it a challenge to us?
C.A.C. Yes, he has come to our side now, and the question has to be raised. God's side is all absolutely perfect, but then we have to take things up, and God has confidence that we shall take them up. It goes on in this chapter to all God has before Him relative to the scene of sin and death; He has before Him to bring in eternal life.
Ques. Would you say a word on "freedom from sin" (verses 18, 22)? Is it the ground we are entitled to occupy? It is not the idea of sinlessness some people talk of?
C.A.C. It does not mean that there is not sin in us. "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves" (@1 John 1: 8). But then no saint in the good of the gospel is under the power of sin. It is freedom from it in the sense that it has no longer any claim on us. There is absolute moral severance from that principle brought in by the first man. The death of Christ is our title to take that ground.
Rem. Hence I reckon.
{525}
C.A.C. Yes, He died to sin once for all, and we are to reckon ourselves "dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus". There is no other kind of christianity that I know of.
Rem. So the Lord takes up a new position in resurrection, and so we do in a moral way and are pleasing to God.
C.A.C. So that newness of life is linked on with His being raised by the glory of the Father.
Ques. Why "the end"?
C.A.C. It does not mean that the end -- eternal life -- is to go to heaven. It is the spiritual end of this course; we shall become qualified to enjoy eternal life. It is something to be enjoyed now, but in that moral connection, following righteousness unto holiness. When the saints are together, we touch an order of things entirely outside the sphere of sin and death, in the knowledge of God and of Christ and of how He has set us together in Christ. Perhaps we might enjoy it more.
It is all there in Himself; that is, it is in no way connected with the first man, it is connected with the second Man.

CHRIST -- A PRIEST FOR THE LIVING
@John 6:53 - 58; @Romans 7: 4; @Romans 8:31 - 39; @Galatians 2: 19, 20
My desire in reading these scriptures is that our hearts may be directed to the consideration of Christ as Priest. It may be as well to say at the outset that Christ as Priest is for the living, not for the dead. There are those of whom it may be said, "Ye have no life in yourselves", and such can know nothing of Christ as Priest. They must be first brought to know Him as Saviour, to know the wonderful and blessed place which He holds as the Head of every man.
"Christ is the head of every man" (@1 Corinthians 11: 3) and that on two grounds: He holds the first place by His personal title, and also by His redemption title. As to His personal title, He was "God ... manifested in flesh" (@1 Timothy 3: 16), and it is incontrovertible that if He "who is over all, God blessed for ever" (@Romans 9: 5) was pleased to become Man He necessarily holds the first place in relation to every man. It has often been said that the Creator could not possibly come into creation without taking the first place in it. The He has also redemption rights. There are two great questions which closely affect every man, woman and child in this world: sin and death. Who can deal with these terrible and world-wide realities? There is no man who is competent to deal with the question of sin, and not all the power in the world can cope for an instant with death. But Christ has dealt with the whole question of sin at the cross; He has glorified God and removed every barrier that stood in the way of man's blessing. He has also annulled the power of death by coming into it in grace. He -- the holy One of God -- was totally exempt from any liability to death as to His own Person, but in blessed grace He came into it on our behalf. He has annulled
{527}
death and brought life and incorruptibility to light by the gospel.
Christ is absolutely without a rival. There are many religions in the world, but there is only one Person who has ever taken the place of glorifying God about sin so as to bring in righteousness for men; and there is only one Person who has ever gone into death in such a way as to break its power, and has given many proofs of His victory in resurrection. The moment anyone begins to think seriously of these things he must see that Christ holds the first place; He has accomplished for man that which none other could even attempt; so that by personal title and by redemption title Christ is the Head of every man.
It is written that "repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations" (@Luke 24: 47). "All the prophets bear witness that every one that believes on him will receive through his name remission of sins" (@Acts 10: 43). "Through this man remission of sins is preached to you, and from all things ... in him every one that believes is justified" (@Acts 13: 38, 39). I trust that all here have believed on that blessed One, and have recognised the wonderful place which He holds as the Head of every man.
When we believe in Christ as the One in whom righteousness and life are brought in we receive the Holy Spirit. He gives the Spirit and in @John 4 this is contrasted with what the world has to give, "Every one who drinks of this water shall thirst again; but whosoever drinks of the water which I shall give him shall never thirst for ever, but the water which I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life" (@John 4: 13, 14). Every one who comes to Christ and believes in Him as the blessed Person who has brought in righteousness and life receives from Him the gift of the Spirit. The great gain of having the Spirit is that we are energised in our affections towards Christ. There is a divine power resident in the believer that is able to maintain him in freshness of affection towards Christ
{528}
in spite of all the influences of the world.
As energised by the Holy Spirit in the inner man we learn three things which are brought before us in @John 6. Firstly, we learn that the flesh profits nothing (@John 6: 63). I do not think that anyone could really discern the utter unprofitableness of the flesh until he had the Spirit. The conscience of man takes account of sins but when one is born anew and has received the Spirit there is divine capability to discern the utter worthlessness of the flesh. As in the flesh we are under death and condemnation .
Then, in the second place we learn that there is a way of escape from this state. No one could really be happy with God so long as he was identified in his spirit and conscience with the flesh. Not that there is actual deliverance from the presence of the flesh. This will not be until death, or the coming of the Lord. But there is a way of deliverance in spirit by the appropriation of Christ's death. No one knows much about life until he knows what it is to be free in spirit from the flesh that "profits nothing". "Unless ye shall have eaten the flesh of the Son of man, and drunk his blood, ye have no life in yourselves" (verse 53).
It is by appropriating the death of Christ that we find ourselves detached in spirit from all that we are as in the flesh. We have to appropriate the death of Christ as that in which our history as in the flesh has closed under divine judgment. He came here in likeness of flesh of sin and went to the cross to be there made sacrificially what we were actually, so that all that we were morally as in the flesh might be condemned and removed in judgment from before God's eye. The end of all flesh has come before God in the death of Christ. Now we have to feed on that death -- to appropriate the value and meaning of it -- as that by which we are freed in spirit from our worthless selves.
Then, thirdly, we learn that the death of Christ is not only our way out of all that we are morally as in the flesh, but it is our way into the love of God. Christ has come into death that
{529}
He might open an eternal well-spring of divine love for our hearts, so that we might live in that love. He came from Godhead's fullest glory down to the dust of death that He might give expression to all the depths of God's nature, and place the love of God within reach of the appropriation of our hearts. The Spirit energises us in the inward man for the appropriation of that love. The well of water in the believer is the Spirit giving energy of affection to enter thus into eternal life. It is by the Spirit we have life in us -- that capacity to know divine love, so as to live in it. "He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has life eternal" (verse 54).
Then we get the appropriation of Christ Himself. "As the living Father has sent me and I live on account of the Father, *he* also who eats me shall live also on account of me" (verse 57). The Christian lives on account of Christ; he lives because he is energised in his affections by the Spirit to appropriate what Christ is at the right hand of God. The One who came down out of heaven to give His flesh for the life of the world has ascended up where He was before, and He is there as Priest to sustain His saints in life.
In @Romans 7: 4 we get two thoughts which may be looked at in connection with what has come before us. "*Ye* also have been made dead to the law by the body of the Christ, to be to another, who has been raised up from among the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God". Here we get the death of Christ as that by which we are freed from the law, and then the thought of coming into such relation to Christ as the risen, living One that we bring forth fruit to God. Fruit is the evidence of life, and it is the result of being married to Christ. He came into death in order to set us free from the law, the claim of which being brought home to us as in the flesh could only produce the sense of utter weakness and condemnation. But, on the other hand, Christ is raised from the dead, and lives for evermore, that we may come into contact with Him, and be strengthened and succoured by Him so as to bring forth fruit to God.
{530}
If we, by the Spirit, know what it is to be to Another we find that He is a wonderful Husband. He nourishes and cherishes the assembly, and what He does for the whole company He does for each one of those who compose it. The idea of nourishing is that He meets every need. He furnishes a supply of all the grace and strength that is needed to sustain the soul and carry it along according to the pleasure of God. Then He also cherishes; that is, He cultivates and brings into activity the spiritual affections of His saints. When Ruth came to Boaz he first nourished her. She came in a necessitous state, and he loaded her with his bounty. Then he took her as his wife; he brought her into the circle of his affections and cherished her.
There is another thing of great importance in connection with bringing forth fruit to God. The assembly is not only nourished and cherished by Christ, but she is subjected to Him. We are married to Christ in order to come under His blessed control, and the one who has known what it is to be nourished and cherished by Him delights to be subjected to Him. It is when we are nourished and cherished by Christ, and subjected to Him, that we bring forth fruit to God. Our own will is set aside. We are controlled and commanded by Christ. He becomes "to all them that obey him, author of eternal salvation; addressed by God as high priest according to the order of Melchisedec" (@Hebrews 5: 9, 10).
In @Romans 8 we are looked at as being in Christ Jesus, and as having received the Spirit, so that we may walk after the Spirit, and know the love of God so as to love Him in response. Then in verse 34 is introduced the fact that Christ at the right hand of God makes intercession for us. When Paul says, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?", it is clearly the love of Christ as Priest that is before him. How blessed to know that not all the power of evil without can separate us from the love of the Priest! In presence of all the power of the enemy, "we more than conquer through him that has loved us". Instead of pressure here coming in
{531}
between our hearts and the love of Christ it only furnishes an opportunity for that love to be more active on our behalf. It is not only that the tried Christian believes this; he finds it to be a reality.
The object of Christ's priestly intercession is that our hearts may be kept in the knowledge and joy of the love of God. The effect of His intercession is that we are persuaded that nothing "shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord". Christ came down from the top to the bottom to open for us, in His own precious death, the springs of divine love. He has now gone back from the bottom to the top as a risen and glorified Man to intercede for us that we may not be moved away from those springs of divine love.
Then in @Galatians 2: 19, 20 we see that the law had said its last word to Paul in the death of Christ, and now, as having Christ living in his affections, he lived to God. If anyone could have looked into Paul's heart he would have found that Paul was nothing there, but that Christ was everything. It is possible to be trying to live Christ externally while self is large in the heart, but the great thing is that Christ should live in our affections. Then the apostle could say as to his practical life as a man in this world, "In that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me". He lived on account of that blessed Person at the right hand of God. The Son of God was a greater reality to Paul than anything that existed in the sphere of sight. Every step that he took in his life in flesh down here he took in the light of the Son of God in glory. Human influences and motives did not rule him; circumstances did not control him; he lived in the light of the Son of God, as bound to Him by the love in which that blessed One had given Himself for him. And from the Son of God he drew support and succour for all the needs of his path and service.
{532}
CONSCIOUSLY IN CHRIST JESUS
All christian consciousness is in the Spirit. Faith consists in having light with regard to God and Jesus Christ. The gospel brings the light, but faith alone gets the benefit of it. Faith lays hold of what divine Persons are in grace to men, and there is ability to appreciate it because all who have faith have been born anew. Then we learn further that by the work of God we are not only born anew and have faith, but we are in Christ Jesus ... under a new headship according to which we have administered to us the full blessing of God ... . An act of sovereign love has put us in Him, and in order that we may have the consciousness of this God has given us the Spirit. The "in Christ Jesus" of @Romans 8: 1 is that we are there consciously so that we are no longer under condemnation as in chapter 7. The Spirit is the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus. We have life in Christ Jesus and the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of that life, and He is given to bring in a new dominating principle -- the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free: it is all consciously known. The dominating principle of sin and of death is dispossessed. We do not now walk according to flesh but according to Spirit. The Christian as such is according to Spirit -- consciously so -- and he minds the things of the Spirit. By the Spirit we put to death the deeds of the body; we are led by the Spirit; we have the Spirit of sonship and the Spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God. It is all consciousness.
{533}
ROMANS AND COLOSSIANS
I am thankful that you have been occupied with Jordan and the land. In speaking of such things one fears to go beyond what one has at least tasted, but I think I can say the greatness and blessedness of what it is to be in association with Christ in *life*, and in the sphere of His life, enlarges before one's soul. This is Colossians, and it is, so to speak, the counterpart to @Romans 6. In @Romans 6 we break morally with the whole circle of things where Christ is not. We refuse to live where He died. It is evident that the secret spring of this is in *affection*. Knowledge of doctrine, and even faith in the doctrine, will never make a man dead to sin. It is as we are drawn to Him in affection that we break in heart with everything that is going on in the place where He died. We accept death here because He died here. This is Marah, and it is the lack of accepting this experimentally which is the source of almost every failure in the wilderness, and it is also for lack of it that we oftentimes wander so much and journey so little.
I do not think it is the mind of God that there should be a long gap between Marah at the beginning of the wilderness, and the brazen serpent and Jordan at the end. I am sure, if the first were fully and truly accepted, we should quickly reach the other. @Romans 6, @Romans 8 and Colossians are distinct steps, but they naturally follow each other, and there is no divine reason why there should be a long halt between them. If we accepted death to everything that is morally characteristic of the world and of our old man, we should really want death in the Jordan aspect as our way into association with Him in life and love. Romans shows how we are *brought out* of the circle of darkness and lust and death; but Colossians opens up the way in which we are *brought in* to a wondrous circle of light and love as quickened together with Christ and risen with Him. This latter is Jordan, and
{534}
introduces us to a sphere where Christ is everything and in all -- the assembly as the home on earth of divine affections.
I think the fact that the pot of manna and the budding rod were in the ark is full of significance. These types suggest to us how the blessed Lord wins our hearts so as to attract us into the sphere of life. We must know Him as the Source for our hearts of heavenly grace suited to wilderness need. There is not a trial or pressure in the pathway here, or in the service, for which He cannot supply the suited grace. "My grace suffices thee" is manna. I believe the Lord desires to become indispensable to us, and all-sufficient for us, in the pathway here, that thus He may become supremely attractive to our hearts, and that we may be mightily drawn after Him to the sphere of His life.
Then the budding rod of priesthood speaks of His infinite capability to lead us in. We are not left to make our own way in. It is as sustained and upborne by Him that we pass in to join Him in that holy scene of divine glory of which He is Minister. For Colossians and Hebrews go together, and the sanctuary is morally the land.
It is a blessed comfort and joy to my heart to know that it is such a delight to His heart to lead us in. All that is needed on our side is hearts responsive to Him and to the Father's love.
{535}
CHRIST IN THE SAINTS
@Romans 8: 9, 10; @Galatians 2: 20; @Galatians 4: 19; @Colossians 1: 24 - 29
C.A.C. It is important to keep before us the thought of Christ being in the saints. It brings out one of the greatest thoughts of God. Paul could speak of it as a mystery which had riches of glory; as though to stimulate the interest of our hearts in it. There are riches of glory resident in the fact that Christ is in the saints and particularly in Gentiles. "The riches of the glory" seems to suggest to one's mind a certain radiancy; and I believe that God would invest His saints with radiance. We are in a dark world and in a dark christian profession, but God would invest us with radiance. I suggested the verses in @Romans 8 because they give us the foundational thought of Christ being in the saints. I do not think it could have been said of the Old Testament saints that Christ was in them. The Spirit of Christ was in them as a prophetic Spirit, but that is rather a different thought. Scripture does not say that Christ was in them, and I do not know that Christ will ever be in any other company than the assembly. Certainly not in the same way. So that we should consider this as a unique glory that attaches to the saints now.
The Spirit of God dwells in us, who is also the Spirit of Christ, and that is how it comes about that Christ is in us. We do well to remember that the great witness to Christ risen and exalted on the day of Pentecost was that there were a hundred and twenty persons who had received the Holy Spirit. And before the close of the day three thousand were added to that company. And, as we all remember, within a few days the number of the men was about five thousand. What a testimony to Christ! God's testimony to Christ is a company of persons here on earth indwelt by God's Spirit, of
{536}
whom it can be said that they are not in the flesh. That could not have been said of Abraham or David, it could not even have been said of Peter or John, while the Lord was on earth. But it is wonderful to think that there are a number of persons now on earth of whom it can be definitely said "Ye are not in flesh but in Spirit, if indeed God's Spirit dwell in you".
It is a question of a state in which we can please God. Those who are in flesh cannot please God. Now Christ has come in as God's Anointed, and has died and been raised and exalted, and the benefit of receiving Christ and believing on Christ is that we get the Holy Spirit. And the very presence of the Spirit in us puts us into an entirely new state, in which we can please God. Now it is good for the youngest believer to recognise that divine fact. We are spiritually strengthened and helped as we recognise the great spiritual facts which are subsisting realities. Christ is so great, that He is able to do what no other Man could do; He can give His Spirit to thousands of persons. There are thousands of people in this world who have the Spirit of Christ. They are of Christ; that is, they do not take account of themselves as having anything that is of value save what they have received from Christ. Christ has become the fountain from which they have drawn every supply as the great treasury and reservoir of divine blessing. Everyone of that company has the Spirit of Christ, and that is how Christ comes to be in us. He is in us in virtue of His Spirit being in us. It would help all young believers to recognise that spiritual fact.
Ques. Would you say that if that is enjoyed it brings about a universal outlook?
C.A.C. Well, it lays the foundation for the truth of the mystery, and that brings in what is universal. If the Spirit of Christ dwells in all the saints, there is a wonderful basis for spiritual unity. There is, indeed, a new spring of life morally. There is actually in the believer a new spring of life, in virtue of the Spirit's presence. This is illustrated in Elisha and
{537}
Elijah. Elijah asked Elisha what he should do for him, and Elisha asked for a double portion of Elijah's spirit; and he was told that if he saw Elijah when he was taken, it would come to pass. And it did come to pass. Now Christ has gone up to the right hand of God -- and those who see Him go up receive a double portion of His Spirit, such as no other saints will ever get. It belongs to the saints of this period to have the double portion -- that is the portion of the firstborn. The assembly is the first-fruits of Christ's vigour, and the saints of the assembly have the double portion of His Spirit. Therefore Christ is in the saints, you might say, potentially. That is, there is power connected with it, and therefore great possibilities.
Ques. Why do so many believers seem to remain units?
C.A.C. Well, I doubt whether very many have really taken in the divine thought of the Spirit being here. If I understood that I have received the Spirit through faith in Christ and in the value of redemption, I should have an instinctive sense that thousands of other people had received the same Spirit. So that one would come, in that way, to the truth of the assembly; that is, we should recognise the saints as a company indwelt by the Spirit. Many Christians do not recognise that in any practical way.
We read here (@Romans 8: 10) that "if Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin". The presence of Christ in the believer brings to an end the life that naturally attaches to the body. A certain life was connected naturally with the body; the body is the vessel or vehicle by which we do everything; a man could not sin without his body. If the body were actually dead the life of sin would be at an end. Now if the body acts in the life that naturally belongs to it, it is the vehicle of sin. But the coming in of Christ makes a wonderful change -- "If Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin". As regards that particular thing the body is dead now. A new source and spring of life has come in altogether different from the life that naturally attaches to the body, and
{538}
the Spirit is now life in the sense of power to move on the line of righteousness. The body is looked at here as having a certain life in which it acts. We read (verse 13) of "the deeds of the body" as if the body were the actor. Now if the body is the actor it produces nothing but sin. But now a new life and power have been brought in. I remember hearing of Mr. Darby having a debate with a Jesuit who contended that the Christian's body should be like a corpse moved by a stick.
The Jesuit's idea was that the Christian ought to do nothing but what the priest told him, he was to be like a corpse entirely controlled by the priest; Mr. Darby said, I accept your figure, but the 'stick' must be the Spirit of God.
Ques. What connection has this with the word in chapter 6, "Reckon yourselves dead to sin" etc?
C.A.C. That is a question of reckoning, of how you take account of things, but when you come to chapter 8 there is a new power, a new spring of life in the believer, Christ is in him. Now that is what every believer, young or old, ought to recognise.
Ques. Does not this suggest the immensity of the gift?
C.A.C. Yes, I am sure if we recognised the presence of the Spirit and Christ as living in us, there would be power to terminate the life -- of course I am speaking morally -- that is naturally connected with the body. It is a wonderful thought that Christ should be in the saints, is it not? It is not a modification of what we were, or an improvement on it; it is not that we are reformed and leading a different life in that sense. It is an entirely new thing which is illustrated by what was said to Saul; "Thou ... shalt be turned into another man" (@1 Samuel 10: 6). If Christ is in us, that is the life of another Man.
Ques. "The Spirit life on account of righteousness", would you say a word about that?
C.A.C. If the Spirit is life we shall move on the line of righteousness; what is right will have place. This chapter speaks of the righteous requirement of the law being fulfilled in us; the Christian fulfils what is right because he walks in
{539}
love, love is the whole law (chapter 13: 10). The law is brought down to one word.
If we pass on to Galatians we find that in the assemblies in Galatia the people of God had got away from any true thought of Christ being in them.
Ques. I should like to ask, is there not a sense in which there is nothing beyond @Romans 8? Would you agree that everything beyond is really a development of that?
C.A.C. Well, yes, the great thoughts of God are there, just as you might say there is nothing beyond chapter 5. Chapter 5 leads up to the point of boasting in God and having life eternal. A kind of terminus is reached, and chapter 8 brings out what we have in the Spirit, and, in one sense, we cannot get beyond that.
Ques. Is this new source of life in every believer?
C.A.C. It is in every believer who has the Spirit.
Ques. I wonder if we are all clear as to the Spirit being life on account of righteousness?
C.A.C. It is quite certain that if the Spirit is life there will not be activities that have the character of sin. The activities which result from the Spirit being life will have the character of righteousness. If the body acts in virtue of the life that attaches to it naturally its activities will have the nature of sin, but if the Spirit is life instead of the life that naturally attaches to the body, all the resulting activities will have the character of righteousness. This comes about in virtue of the fact that the Spirit has become life. So that now the body can be presented to God as a living sacrifice. What new activities are brought out in chapter 12! It is a wonderful thing to speak what is right, and to do what is right, and no one but the Christian does; because for a thing to be right, it must be done in relation to God, and to the position and relationships in which God has set us.
Rem. The apostle says, "I buffet my body, and lead it captive" (@1 Corinthians 9: 27).
C.A.C. Yes, he kept it under; and so in this chapter, "If, by the Spirit, ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall
{540}
live". The Christian now has power to put to death the deeds of the body; that is, all those deeds which are naturally the outcome of the life of the body, and in which it was the vehicle of sin. There is power by the Spirit to put that to death. You are never told to be dead to the flesh. Some of us have tried it, and it is a hard job. We are to be superior to it in the power of life. Another kind of life morally has come in in virtue of the presence of the Spirit, and Christ is in the saints. That is the life we have to make provision for; Christ is in us. What a difference it would make! And it would lead us to walk in harmony with those who have the Spirit of Christ, because what is of Christ in one will never conflict with what is of Christ in another. And thus the elements are brought in that really constitute the body.
Rem. The apostle could exhort Timothy to follow righteousness, faith, love, peace, etc.
C.A.C. That has in view practical righteousness as in contrast to everything that is unrighteous in the christian profession. What is not according to God is unrighteous and it is no evidence of Christ being in the saints if we are going on with something that is not right; it is really a practical denial of Christ being in us.
Ques. Would you say that when the Lord breathed into the disciples this was the kind of life they received?
C.A.C. Yes, I think it would include this.
Ques. A moral link with that Man?
C.A.C. It is even more than that. If Christ is in us it is more than having a link, is it not? It is a positive fact, and God would send every one of us away with a deeper sense of it, that Christ is in us. He is in us in a very powerful way, for He is in us in virtue of the indwelling of a divine Person. Could you think of anything morally greater than that? That the Holy Spirit is in you, and in virtue of that divine Person being there Christ is in you.
Rem. A sense of that in the soul would do away with individualism.
{541}
C.A.C. Yes, the gospel always has in view the mystery. Now you can understand how busily the devil would work to get people away from this, and we find that the assemblies in Galatia had got right away from the thought of Christ being in them. And that leads Paul to travail in birth again until Christ was formed in them. He was set to repair the damage by bringing Christ into their souls in a more definite and substantial way than they had at the beginning.
Ques. What do you mean by something more substantial?
C.A.C. I was thinking that Christ being formed suggests spiritual substance. In Romans, Christ is in the saints, there is life and power, just as you might have in a babe -- a potentiality which may develop to any extent afterwards, but there is hardly the thought of formation. I think perhaps that is what many believers lack, Christ being formed in them.
Ques. The features of Christ?
C.A.C. Well, I was not thinking of that exactly, though if Christ were found in us that would work out all right. But the Galatians had got away from the thought of Christ being in them. They were occupied with circumcision and observance of days and months and years, and going back to the law. They had been diverted from Christ by occupation with these things; they had turned from what was of true value to what was worthless. How small all these things look in comparison with Christ -- law-keeping and circumcision and observance of days! Paul says they are weak and beggarly elements. He has in mind a majestic thought, for it is a majestic thought that Christ should be formed in us. Paul is in an agony, he travails in birth, showing us the important place prayer would have in connection with the formation of Christ. One may contribute greatly to the formation of Christ in another by prayer, by travail of soul. And I think the Spirit of God would suggest the thought of that to us all. The thought of being deeply concerned that there should be a formation of Christ in the brethren.
Ques. You spoke of potentialities -- do we understand
{542}
that the Galatians had these potentialities but went no further?
C.A.C. That is so. We know that they had received Christ, and they had received the Spirit, but they had turned away from that line altogether, and on to the line of the flesh; religious flesh, flesh that would keep the law and be circumcised. Now the apostle was intensely concerned that Christ should be formed in them.
Rem. It is easier to improve the flesh than to be exercised about Christ being formed.
C.A.C. Well, it is easier for the flesh, but it is opposite to all that is of God. If we want any help as to what Christ being formed in us means, I think this epistle would show us. Paul would show us that every thought of God in regard to man's blessing has reached its ultimate point in Christ. He even goes so far as to say that the promises were made to Christ; that is, God has committed Himself to Christ, not to any other man. To have that formed in the soul seems to suggest something wrought by God that will not be easily overturned. We can understand Paul, looking at the potentiality that is in the saints, desiring that Christ should be formed in them. It is a great thing to see that as regards the blessing of God there is nothing to be added; things have reached fruition and finality in Christ. And our blessing in a practical sense, our spiritual liberty, is bound up with Christ being formed in us by the Spirit. In having Christ formed in us we have spiritually in our souls the full thought of blessing that is in the heart of God towards man. The fulness of it has been reached in Christ, and God would form Christ as the very substance of the gospel in us to give us stability in the knowledge of Himself. So that, not only are all the promises brought to fruition in Christ, but God's great thought of sonship has been secured in Him. To have Him formed in us would free us from all legality. We should have a deep sense that no addition to Christ is needed or is possible. He is formed in us in the greatness of what He is as the treasury of every divine thought of blessing. Paul shows that as far as he
{543}
was concerned he was on this line; "I am crucified with Christ" etc. Peter had been maintaining his reputation as a Jew by not eating with the Gentiles, but Paul saw that that was a falsification of the whole position. It was not having the sense of being crucified with Christ and Christ living in him. Paul had the sense of being crucified with Christ. "And no longer live, I, but Christ lives in me". It was really like a new individuality.
Rem. There is not much room for that order of man in this world.
C.A.C. Well, we do not expect it, do we? But there is another world where the great thoughts of God are known, and those thoughts lead on to the mystery. God had things in His mind about which He kept silent. It is a wonderful thing. God kept silence for four thousand years about the mystery; this wonderful thought of God was hid from ages and from generations but it is now made known to His saints. I wonder if we are all intensely interested in it? Paul speaks of the Gentiles being made acquainted with this precious thought of God. "The riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you the hope of glory". The glory has not come yet; it is yet a matter of hope; but the wonderful thing is that Christ is here without the glory; He is in His saints, and particularly in Gentiles. Christ in the saints is not merely a question of what God sees; it is a reality; it is the greatest reality on this earth at the present moment. There is nothing in this world at all comparable to that great reality -- Christ in the saints.
"The riches of the glory of this mystery" shows that while glory is not yet manifested publicly, as it will be, there is at the present time a glory that has the character of mystery; it is only known to those initiated. The wonderful thing is that Christ is not only at the right hand of God, but He is here, though the glory has not come publicly; it is yet a matter of hope. But Christ is here in the saints and particularly in a gentile company.
Rem. Christ in the saints is the hope of glory.
{544}
C.A.C. The fact of Christ being in the saints brings the whole system of glory into view as a matter of hope. Paul speaks to the Ephesians about ministering as glad tidings "the unsearchable riches of the Christ". Christ is the great treasury of divine thoughts. But in Colossians the assembly is the treasury, for the riches are in the mystery, and the mystery is that Christ is in the saints; so that the assembly becomes the treasury of all divine thoughts.
Rem. That would keep the saints from the world.
C.A.C. Yes, it frees us from the world and sets us together, spiritually and vitally, as those in whom Christ is, and who have Christ as their life. It puts us outside the range of things that belong to man after the flesh. What a wonderful thing to be in a circle where Christ is everything and in all. "Christ ... everything" is objective, so that when you come into the meetings you do not find anybody exalted but Christ; every brother that takes part, whether he prays or praises or gives a word, exalts Christ. And then "in all"; He is in the saints as the power of life.
Ques. Do you look upon formation as bringing into the soul the feelings and motives of Christ?
C.A.C. Well, I think that would be the result. The apostle in writing to the Galatians was concerned that they should realise the character of the blessing into which they were brought. They had got away from the true character of their blessing and all sorts of fleshly activity had come in. To have Christ formed in them, as the One in whom all divine thoughts were set forth, would bring in new motives and a new power. There is power in connection with the system of blessing in Christ, power to walk in the Spirit, and to bring forth the fruit of the Spirit. But that is all rather the consequence of having Christ formed in us. As Christ is formed in us, we are freed from legal entanglements and self-consideration and are free to move in spiritual liberty, and the fruit of the Spirit comes out in the saints.
{545}
Rem. David could say in @Psalm 139, "How precious are thy thoughts unto me, O God!"
C.A.C. Yes: "When I awake, I am still with thee". You wake up in a region where you are with God in His great thoughts. God has been pleased to indicate to us that the mystery is greater to Him than anything else. Now what is it to us? Is it just a word that we hear the brothers use in their addresses and prayers, or is it a spiritual reality that is greater than anything else in the universe? Outside divine Persons themselves there is nothing so great as the mystery, and the Colossian aspect of it is "Christ in you". Let us pray about it.
{546}
WHAT IS IN THE HEART OF CHRIST
@Romans 8: 31 - 39
C.A.C. My thought in suggesting this scripture was that we might get Christ in a very definite way before us. I feel it would be a great help to us all if we could apprehend what is in the heart of Christ at the present moment. The only way in which we can get to know Him, or know Him better, is by getting to know what is in His heart Godward and manward. The two thoughts particularly before me are the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord, and the love of Christ in which He intercedes for us. The first of these statements brings Him before us as the Ark of the covenant, the second as the Priest. The first is what He is in relation to God, and the second, what He is in relation to us.
In Christ as the Ark of the covenant, the love of God is now in the Man who delighted to do His will; it is, at the present moment, in the heart of a risen and glorified Man who has accomplished everything that was in the will of God. There is nothing to interfere with the love of God resting on Christ. We begin by thinking of the love of God in relation to us, but it is "in Christ Jesus our Lord". He came into this world in order to give expression to the love of God in death. He is now, personally, in the full enjoyment of what He revealed. He is the first one to enter into the full blessedness of the love of God; it rests in His heart; it is secured there. The love of God is treasured, enshrined, in a Person, an Object, perfectly suited to it. The love of God is in the heart of a Man and we are bound up with it eternally. We learn God's love towards us first. "But God commends his love to us, in that, we being still sinners, Christ has died for us" (@Romans 5: 8). There it is the marvellous self-sacrifice at which God has sent His love to us. On God's part, He has
{547}
made the supreme sacrifice. His own Son has died for us, "we being still sinners". It is the love that surrendered all for sinners.
Christ as the Priest brings before us the place that the saints have in His heart. Two things are in His heart: firstly, the supreme enjoyment of the love of God; that is the love that no creature power can ever separate us from; and, secondly, His saints.
The Ark of the covenant would lose its glory if the saints were not in the blessedness of it. What are the relations between God and man? But the question is, Which man? Man after the flesh or the Man at God's right hand? The relations between God and man are set forth in Christ. The love of God is flowing out on a Man perfectly suitable to Him and there is nothing to hinder Him enjoying it in the greatest possible way: that is the Ark of the covenant. We are bound up with that eternally, nothing can separate us from it. It is a fine thought. It is magnificent but very simple. You learn what is in the heart of Christ now, supreme joy in the love of God. As Man He is in the love of God. It rests there "in Christ Jesus our Lord". It gives perfect liberty when I see that the relations -- the present relations -- of God and man are set forth in Christ, that we may come into the blessedness and joy of them now. When He was here, He was saluted as the beloved Son. He was the Object of the love of God when here and He enjoyed it perfectly all through His course here, but He was absolutely alone. But He went into death and is now risen and glorified, and has as Man come into the love of God, and the love of God is in His heart so that it can be shared. No creature power can separate us from it, the love of God is treasured there.
Ques. "Our Lord". What is involved in that?
C.A.C. He has really become Lord to us as we have learned Him in the grace of the previous chapters of the epistle. As "delivered for our offences and ... raised for our justification" (@Romans 4: 25), He has become Lord to us. We
{548}
are with God in all the blessed clearance that He is in as the risen Man. We give Him the place of supremacy. He is the true Joseph. He administrates to us all the wealth of divine grace (@Romans 5). He must get that place with us before we can appreciate His place as Man in the love of God.
Ques. Would you say some more about Christ as the Ark of the covenant and the Priest?
C.A.C. I think that knowing what is in the heart of the Priest comes first. We have to learn what is in the heart of Christ. What does He think of me and of all saints? How does He think of us? He expresses in His intercession the thoughts of His heart toward us. We have to learn the wonderful way in which divine love has set us up. It is an immense thing to learn that. It is of the greatest help to us to know Christ's thoughts of us. "It is Christ who has died, but rather has been also raised up; who is also at the right hand of God; who also intercedes for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?" (@Romans 8: 34, 35). It is the love of the One who intercedes for us, who has died, has been raised and is at the right hand of God. He cannot regard His saints in any other light than being in the good of His death, resurrection and exaltation, and on the ground of that, He intercedes for us.
I could say to a doubting believer, 'Do you think that Christ intercedes for you in your sins when He knows that He has put them all away?' Let us think of things as Christ thinks of them. Would He ever pray for His saints as if they were living in the world, in vain pleasing, etc.? Impossible. He has died and believers have been buried with Him in baptism. A Christian living in the world has put himself outside the intercession of Christ. How could He pray for such a man?
Ques. Would @John 17 show how He prays for us?
C.A.C. @John 17 is the Priest at the golden altar. Is there any reference to any worldliness on the part of the disciples? Impossible. He speaks of them in the light of divine love and purpose and views them entirely from that standpoint. Did Christ refer to their failings? Never. @John 17 is a little sample
{549}
of His intercession. But you say, 'Did not He pray for failing Simon?' Yes, but as a man of faith. He took account of what was there that was of God. "I have besought for thee that thy faith fail not". He takes account of what has been divinely wrought in our souls, He never comes down to our level but intercedes for us according to the value we have in His own heart. We have a wonderful place in His heart. I heard of a brother once who asked another who was ill, 'How are you?' The answer was, 'I am in the 17th of John'. That is where you learn the love of Christ, by knowing how He regards us, in the light of His own thoughts and according to the pleasure of God. But you may say, 'Is He not our advocate?' (@1 John 2: 2). Yes. But that is not priestly intercession; it is a separate part of His service but it does not come in with the breastplate or the shoulder-pieces (@Exodus 28: 9, 10, 21). That seems to me to suggest the way that the saints are in the heart of Christ before God. Firstly, on the stones for the shoulderpieces the names are engraved "according to their birth" -- how they were born as children of Jacob. Secondly, on the stones for the breastplate they are engraven "according to his name shall they be for the twelve tribes", a different setting of names.
The Lord carries us before God, as typified in the shoulder-pieces, according to divine generation. We are all alike in that. It was the two onyx stones that were used for this. It is like @Romans 8, that which is true of all saints. But as in the breastplate, we are not all alike but have our different places in the body. Twelve different stones are used. "As God has dealt to each a measure of faith ... but having different gifts, according to the grace which has been given to us" (@Romans 12: 3, 6).
It is of the greatest possible value to us as believers to know how to think of ourselves as Christ looks at us. I can only learn my true place and my true value as learning it in the heart of Christ. The question is, What is true of me in the heart of Christ? We show where we are ourselves by the thoughts we have of our brethren. If I know my place in the
{550}
heart of Christ, I know the place of every other saint as in @Romans 8. In the heart of Christ there can be no other thought. He never thinks of me as in the flesh. He bore the judgment of man in the flesh that I might be transferred from that. The truth is that we are in Christ Jesus. How? God put us there through redemption and the gift of the Spirit. "Of him are *ye* in Christ Jesus" (@1 Corinthians 1: 30). God put us there. It is a great thing to learn things from the top. In the heart of Christ His saints are always viewed as "in Christ Jesus", heirs, brethren of the Firstborn, etc. (@Romans 8). We can understand how He values us. We are all alike according to divine calling and generation in the shoulder-pieces. In the breastplate we all differ. It is our place in relation to the testimony. There are twelve different stones. In @Romans 8 we are all alike, the onyx stone. In @Romans 12 we differ, twelve different stones. Each stone has its separate place (twelve is the perfect number administratively). Each apostle was different. Each had his own impression of Christ and ministered that. "As God has dealt to each a measure of faith" (@Romans 12: 3). The bit He has given me is not the bit He has given you. The question is, What is the thing that God would have me to do? There is something in the heart of Christ that tells me what to do. The Urim and the Thummim were in the breastplate. God has dealt to each a measure of faith. You may be saying, 'But I have not anything at all'. But you have. There is something you have faith to do -- faith to take a certain place in the testimony here -- and if you do not do it you are not in accord with the breastplate. You are set among the people of God with a specific gift of faith and the intercession of Christ supports you in that service. By any brother or sister not filling the place God has given them, all suffer. The body suffers. "If one member suffer, all the members suffer with it". It needs all as put together in the unity of the testimony. If all are working properly there is beautiful harmony, all fitting together. @Romans 8 gives us our general place of sons, children, heirs, brethren of the Firstborn; @Romans 12 our speciality.
{551}
Each one of us has a place in the heart of Christ as Priest. We need to get near enough to Him to know it so as to answer down here to the place I have up there in the breastplate. I want to be learning what is in the heart of Christ, learning divine thoughts all the time. The calling of God is maintained at its full height in the heart of the Priest. When I know that, then I want to learn what is in His heart -- "in Christ Jesus", "in Spirit", "sons", "children", etc. Learning it in the heart of Christ touches you more than learning it in the Scriptures. All hangs on the fact that He has died, has been raised up and is at the right hand of God. He never loses sight of what all that means -- death, what is ended; resurrection, what is introduced or established; the right hand of God, the new place, what we are in the heart of Christ.
Ques. What do the Urim and the Thummim mean for us?
C.A.C. They signify direction, spiritual direction, the intimation of God's mind. We are directed in our exercises. There is divine light for us on every difficulty. What the saints are in the heart of Christ is the answer to every question. And, individually, what is my place? It is not merely that I take a place, but if I take the place I have in His heart, His intercession helps me. You think "soberly" as to what the grace of God and the love of Christ would make you. To take the place allotted to me is the secret of happiness. There are far more saints who stop short of their divine measure than there are those who go beyond it. Most do not come up to it.
Rem. "To every man his work".
C.A.C. He intercedes for us; difficulties come in but they do not separate but become helpful discipline. Discipline that God permits never damages the new man. It is humbling and reducing to the natural but it increases the spiritual. It strips us of all that hinders.
{552}
HEARTS TUNED BY THE PRIEST
Nothing separates us from the love of Christ, and it is His love *as Priest* that is contemplated in this statement (@Romans 8: 34, 35). The failure to realise our dependence upon the *living* Priest in relation to the heavenly calling is a very common one, and accounts for the fact that many who have a large measure of light as to things have not really much experimental access into them. They see what is established in Christ, but they do not see how blessed an office He fills as High Priest of "good things to come" -- things that *have* come spiritually in christianity. All that He brings to us as Mediator He has to bring us into as Priest. We only come up from the wilderness into the sphere of spiritual blessing according as we lean upon our Beloved (@Song of Songs 8: 5). Indeed, it is *this* that makes Christ so precious to the heart -- so personally indispensable.
It is not merely that we are introduced to a most wonderful system of grace and glory, but the very One who has inaugurated it all and in whom it is all established puts out His hand, as it were, to take hold individually of each feeble saint that He may conduct us into it. Tenderness and power are exquisitely blended in the touch of that hand. He does not deal with us 'en masse', but with perfect consideration of the personal needs and exercises of *each one*.
The resurrection day with its varied and blessed activities illustrates this in a very perfect way. Mary Magdalene, the two going to Emmaus, Peter, etc. were all taken in hand by that wondrous Priest. Each had the special support which the exercises or weaknesses of each required.
It is in this way that the Living One puts *every* string in tune of that wondrous instrument on which He loves to sound God's praises.
Each string must have the touch of the "chief Musician. On stringed instruments" to put it in tune; and then He delights
{553}
to bring His own together in assembly tuned to sound the melody of God's praise with varied but accordant notes, under the further touches of His own hand.
<blockquote>'And a song is sweetly thrilling <br>Every heart within the shrine: <br>Music which God's ear is filling, <br>Notes which could be only Thine'. (`161:7)</blockquote>
{554}
THE ISRAEL OF GOD
@Romans 9: 1 - 5
None of the things mentioned here as the distinction and privilege of Israel have ceased to be; they all subsist in a spiritual way in the church, which is spoken of by Paul in @Galatians 6: 16 as "the Israel of God".
First we get "the adoption" -- sonship. This pertained to Israel as we see in @Exodus 4: 22, 23: "Thus saith Jehovah: Israel is my son, my firstborn. And I say to thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me". But sonship at the present time pertains to the church. Adoption is man in liberty and the joy of known relationship with God. Wherever we find God delighting in His people, and His people delighting in Him, that is, in principle, adoption. It is a mutuality of affection and delight between God and His saints. "If Jehovah delight in us, he will bring us into this land, and give it us" (@Numbers 14: 8), shows adoption known by Joshua and Caleb. God would have His delight in man to be known, and this comes out in adoption.
We are brought into sonship by the Son of God being preached to us as glad tidings. God revealed His Son *in* the apostle Paul; He made that blessed One known in the affections of a man here on earth that that man might preach Him as glad tidings. God's thought for man in wondrous grace is to give him the place, relationship, and Spirit of the risen, glorified Man -- His beloved Son. In this we see how God's heart is set upon man. The shining of it forth in manifest glory will be the blessing of the universe in another day.
The full thought of God concerning us is sonship, and He has set it forth in His beloved Son. When we believe the glad tidings we get the Spirit of God's Son -- the Spirit of sonship -- so that we may delight in God with responsive affections. The ministry of the new covenant sets forth what God is for man, but sonship is what man is for God. It is more than
{555}
reconciliation; I should connect reconciliation with priesthood -- it is moral suitability for service in connection with holy things -- but sonship is relationship and responsive affections. Sonship is involved in "I ascend to my Father and your Father", but reconciliation and priesthood would come in rather with "My God and your God" (@John 20: 17).
Sonship pertained to Israel, but we have it now in a higher way; it was their place as an earthly people, but now sonship is in connection with a heavenly order of things. Israel will come into sonship by and by, but not in the same way as the church. I could not say that the revelation of God will ever be less than it is, but the capacity to receive and respond to it differs in various families. Sonship, as known by us, is the place of the risen glorified Son of God; it has a distinctively *heavenly* character; and we have the Spirit of the One who has ascended to His Father and ours. The apprehension of that gives a blessed sense of liberty. Sonship gives character to the whole structure of grace in the souls of the saints, and we need to be evangelised so as to know it better. We have not the full gospel without sonship. How blessed to see that Man is in the presence of the Father for His delight; God has satisfaction in a perfect Man who answers to Him in full responsive affection. That is His thought for us, and He makes it good *in us* by giving us the Spirit of that Man.
So far as we are concerned the cross has to come in; *we* have to go in judgment, and we have to learn experimentally the necessity for this. But in the gospel, God gives us the truth as divine light; the cross shows me what I am, and how God has removed me from His own eye, and in the Son of God I see the full blessedness of God's thought for me. Romans shows how the gospel is perfectly adapted to meet all the need of man; Galatians shows how it is exclusive of man after the flesh; but in both epistles it is *the Son of God* who is the substance of the glad tidings. @Romans 8 goes on to the consummation of God's purpose -- the saints "conformed to the image of his Son, so that he should be the firstborn among many brethren" (verse 29).
{556}
Then "the glory" pertained to Israel. The glory of Israel was God's presence in their midst. "Thy God thy glory" (@Isaiah 60: 19) will be true of them in the world to come. Simeon, when he took the child Jesus in his arms, spoke of Him as "the glory of thy people Israel" (@Luke 2: 32). The presence of God is today the glory of His people. The church is "built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit". Pentecost was like the glory filling the house. The apostle pressed the truth of the temple upon the Corinthians because if God's glory is in the assembly, man's glory can have no place there. God's presence was to be so really in evidence that an unconverted man coming in to the meetings could take cognisance of it. We are "the living God's temple; according as God has said, I will dwell among them, and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be to me a people" (@2 Corinthians 6: 16). This is "the glory" which pertains to the Israel of God, and it demands separation from everything that is unsuited to the presence of God. He dwells in His assembly, and His activities are there -- it is "the assembly of the living God" (@1 Timothy 3: 15). In the assembly all must be suitable to Him; a vessel to dishonour is one who gives a wrong impression of God. It was when Christians lost the sense of the presence of God that human activities came in. That was the "Ichabod" of the church -- if one may say so -- the glory had departed. All the gifts are in the dispensation of *the Spirit*, under the administration of *the Lord*, but *God* is the One who "operates all things in all" (@1 Corinthians 12: 6). It is a wonderful awakening when souls come to see that God's presence and activities are the glory of His people. After that you do not desire, but dread man's activities.
The next thing is "the covenants". There are two thoughts in connection with covenant. One comes out in @Hebrews 9 where covenant is used very much in the sense of a will which makes known the disposition of the testator. Then there is also in covenant the thought of a bond of agreement according to which two parties go on together. God has brought the
{557}
disposition of His heart into evidence in the death of His Son; He has written that wonderful testament in the blood of His own Son . God has brought to light His perfect grace and love towards His poor fallen creature; His compassion and mercy and goodness are made known in the covenant.
But the very grace which the covenant declares as existing on God's part becomes the bond of agreement between God and those with whom He consummates the covenant. If God engages and binds Himself to man by the covenant it is that man may be bound to Him according to the terms of that covenant. God works in man by His own quickening power, so that there may be an appreciation of the covenant in man's heart. As to Israel, this quickening is seen in the valley of dry bones (@Ezekiel 37). The people will be made to live in the knowledge of God -- to live in that which He has made Himself known to be in grace -- and what God is will be the bond of agreement between Him and His people. "All shall know me in themselves, from the little one among them unto the great among them" (@Hebrews 8: 11), and the knowledge of God will form an unbreakable bond between Him and His people; they will be bound to Him in the knowledge of what He is. "My people shall be satisfied with my goodness" (@Jeremiah 31: 14). What God is becomes the security of the whole universe of bliss.
Closely connected with the covenant is "the lawgiving". God will put His laws into the mind, and write them in the heart of Israel. That is, He will so operate in quickening power in man's intelligence and affections that man will be in accord with all that He is. The Lord is the Spirit of the covenant, but on the other hand Christ is the Spirit of the law. All the will of God in regard to man has come to light in Him; all that is pleasurable to God in man is seen in Christ. In having the Spirit of Christ, and being formed thereby, the "lawgiving" is made good in the saints. God will bring to pass in another day that the law will be set forth in Israel, and His will will find expression in a people here on earth. But
{558}
this has place now in the "Israel of God". In Balaam's prophecy we see a people in the wilderness according to God's mind.
The next thing is "the service". This is in relation to holy things, and is priestly or Levitical. "The service" was all connected with the tabernacle, but we have to do with the spiritual realities which were typified in the tabernacle. It is very important that priestly and Levitical service should be maintained. A priest is marked by intelligence of God's mind. "The priest's lips should keep knowledge, and at his mouth they seek the law" (@Malachi 2: 7). One part of the service is sacrificial; there is the offering up of spiritual sacrifices. Then there is the intercessory part -- the offering of incense on the golden altar. It is a great and holy service to pray for the testimony. Another part of the priest's service has to do with the maintenance of light and administration as set forth in the candlestick and the table of shewbread. Then the Levite is under the direction of the priest, and his service is more of an outward character. We are priests within, but Levites without. We have to carry all that is of God in testimony here. "The service" is maintained today in the Israel of God as saints are exercised and in spiritual power. If we better understood our place in sonship with the Father, we should better understand our position in relation to the testimony. All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge were set forth in figure in the tabernacle; it was a pattern of things in the heavens. The priests and Levites had charge of the tabernacle when it was set up and when it was in movement. We ought to be exercised about being in priestly fitness for "the service". The apostle Paul was concerned as to the Corinthians because they were not in priestly garments. The thought of bearing God's testimony is blessed, but at the same time serious, for it necessitates separation and moral suitability to God. In Nehemiah's day the wall was built before the priests and Levites took up their service.
{559}
Now we come to "the promises". The promises were all occasioned by the development of the power and fruits of evil in the world. And promises come in because in the wisdom of God it was not His way to meet the evil by bringing in *good* manifestly at once, but to leave it to work itself out in full result, and at the same time to be a test and discipline to faith. Evil was manifested here in every possible way, but *good* was known in the blessed promises of God, which faith laid hold of. The promises are wonderful if you look at them as setting forth what is *good* in the midst of a world of evil. God will not merely remove what is evil, but He will remove it by bringing in the corresponding good. He has a triumphant answer of good to every form of evil that sin and Satan's power have brought in . Now the Israel of God is a people here on earth boasting in all the good that is of God. We embrace all that is still future so far as manifestation goes, and stand consciously in all the good of God. He has firmly attached His saints to the One in whom all the good is established; all the promises are Yea and Amen in the Son of God; and all are to the glory of God by us. The church's true dignity and blessedness are to stand consciously in the knowledge and joy of all that is good, and outside the church *good* cannot be found, for it has not yet been brought in publicly.
Then we have "the fathers". We have Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the rest, in a much more real way than Israel after the flesh had them. Every feature of God's ways came out in connection with "the fathers", and nothing is more important than that we should have knowledge of the ways of God. Hence the great value of the Old Testament, and saints lose much who neglect it.
Then the crown of all is "the Christ, who is over all, God blessed for ever". We have Him not according to flesh, but according to Spirit. That wondrous Person of whom we were speaking this afternoon -- the Head. Great glory and privilege attach to the saints as "the Israel of God". Sonship
{560}
is the basis of everything, and the crown and topstone is "the Christ". Paul was in intense exercise because those to whom such blessed things pertained were missing all the good of them. Israel after the flesh missed everything. Now it is an exercise for us whether we are really in the good of what pertains to us as "the Israel of God". May God give us eyes to see, and hearts to value these things, for in them eternal life subsists. These things constitute spiritually Mount Zion where God commands "the blessing, life for evermore" (@Psalm 133: 3).
{561}
"VESSELS TO HONOUR"
@Romans 9: 21 - 26; @2 Timothy 2: 20, 21
C.A.C. My thought was that we might look at the difference between what the saints are as vessels to honour by the purpose and call of God, which nothing can possibly invalidate, and that which it is the privilege of saints to be as vessels to honour in spiritual condition and associations.
In @Romans 9 it is purely a question of God's sovereignty, and every one who is the subject of His blessed call is constituted thereby a vessel to honour. God is going to bring out the riches of His glory in every one of His called ones. There is no difference between men naturally; they are all of the same lump of clay, but the Potter has power over it. The teaching of the epistle is that there is no difference, for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God. Therefore if any difference comes about it is through the sovereign call of God which constitutes His saints vessels of mercy. Mercy is sovereign. There is no intrinsic value in clay; if any form of beauty or any honour is bestowed on it, it is by the will of the Potter. But the vessels to honour in 2 Timothy have intrinsic value; they are vessels of gold and silver.
Ques. Is it like the potter in @Jeremiah 18?
C.A.C. I think that is very suggestive of the gracious work of God when ruin has come in. @Romans 3 describes the marred vessel. Man as fallen is a marred vessel, but then God works in grace to bring about repentance that He may secure, after all, vessels to honour. The kind of honour is that He is going to make known upon them the riches of His glory. We have done nothing to deserve it; we are of the same clay as the most ungodly sinners on the face of the earth; but God in His sovereign mercy has chosen to work in order to constitute us vessels to honour. We all have to admit that naturally there is no difference between us and those
{562}
who find their pleasure in going on without God and without Christ, and who have no true honour.
One of the first features in the riches of God's glory is redemption. It has been thoroughly proved what man is, and now God says, 'I am going to make what man is the opportunity to show what I am. I will make known the riches of My glory on that fallen creature, and make him a vessel of mercy'. All God's operations with the clay are on the ground of the redemption which is in Christ Jesus. God has a blessed and righteous ground on which He can constitute His called ones the vessels of His praise. Man has been alienated from.
God by falling under the power of evil and has incurred great liabilities, but the redemption that is in Christ Jesus meets the whole condition. Redemption is in a risen and glorified Man. God's beloved Son has been set forth a Mercy-seat in the power of His blood, but He has gone back to God as a risen and glorified Man, and redemption is in Him. Redemption secures that we shall be brought back to God ultimately in the condition of the risen and glorified Man. God clothes His called ones with this honour. Vessels of honour suggest the result that is in view; vessels of mercy bring out the character of divine acting through which we are brought into the honour. It is purely on the principle of mercy because we are of the same lump of clay as every one of Adam's race. No angel has ever been called to the honour of expressing the riches of God's glory; it could not be shown in angels, but it is going to be exhibited throughout eternity in man.
The riches of God's glory cover the whole wealth of what has come out from God through our Lord Jesus Christ; not all the powers of earth and hell are able to hinder or invalidate it; it stands in the sovereign power of God. What stability the sense of this gives to the souls of His called ones!
Ques. Is it put on the saints now?
C.A.C. I think it is. It comes out now in three characters which are mentioned here in the quotation from Hosea. "I will call not-my-people My people; and the-not-beloved
{563}
Beloved. And it shall be, in the place where it was said to them, *Ye* are not my people, there shall they be called Sons of the living God". These three thoughts put together describe the vessels to honour, that is, vessels to the honour of God. How wonderful that we, who have been such a dishonour to Him in our natural history, should become vessels to honour to the blessed God as His people, as beloved, and as sons of the living God! And it is "in the place where it was said to them, *Ye* are not my people". It is in the place where we were so contrary to God that we have now become objects of delight to His heart. First as "my people", then "beloved" in covenant relations, and finally "Sons of the living God" in family relationships and affections. If we put the three thoughts together we shall get some apprehension of what the saints are as vessels to honour, and this purely as being vessels of mercy. Believers generally dwell on the past and the future, but do not think enough of the present. But we have the peculiar distinction of being vessels to honour at the present time. The calling of God has dignified and glorified us. We see in redemption the riches of His glory, and on that ground He is the Justifier and the Reconciler. We have to rise up to the wealth of it; it makes us rich in the knowledge of God, and of the love which is the spring of all in His heart.
Ques. How do we rise up to it?
C.A.C. By the call of God. He called us by the glad tidings out of the dark abyss in which we were found naturally "to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ" (@2 Thessalonians 2: 14). He calls us into the greatness of that, and does it sovereignly; on our side we were part of the same lump of clay as others.
There are vessels indeed to dishonour, and it pleases God to endure them with much long-suffering, with a view eventually to making known in them His power and His wrath. Every creature of God must eventually honour God, though it may be in a terrible way of judgment. Even the lost will
{564}
honour God, and God will show in them His power and His wrath. But God does not fit them for destruction; they fit themselves for it by their wickedness, their disobedience, lawlessness and rebellion. Mark the words, "endured with much long-suffering". God is patiently waiting, that sinful persons may repent and turn to Him, and become vessels of mercy. God's sovereignty does not shut anybody out, but it brings many in who would never come in on any other ground. People think that the sovereignty of God is a narrowing up and restricting of blessing, but Paul is carefully showing that it widens out blessing. Elijah said, "I am left, I alone". No! God says, "Yet I have left myself seven thousand" (@1 Kings 19: 10, 18). God's sovereignty was seven thousand times wider in its scope than Elijah thought. In divine sovereignty God widens out His blessed thoughts to bring many in who would otherwise have no blessing at all. That is why we Gentiles are sitting here in the enjoyment of divine favour; it is because the sovereignty of God has widened out to let us in. The sovereignty of God is so large that He will have His house full, and the Jew was not big enough to fill it, so God says, 'I must have the Gentile too'! None of us here would have had blessing if it were not for the sovereign mercy of God. The moment a sinner repents he has become, by the fact of his repentance, a vessel of mercy. There could not possibly be such a thing as a repentant sinner wanting the blessing of God, and being unable to get it. The sovereignty of God makes blessing certain for every repentant sinner. The gospel reveals to us that God gave His only-begotten Son to go to the cross and be made sin, and that He is now operating in myriads of hearts by His Spirit in order that He may make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy. My next-door neighbour has not a thought for his soul, goes his own way, does his own will, with no reference to God! How is it that I am different? Only mercy, just sovereign mercy.
The apostle's object is to intensify in our souls the sense of sovereign mercy; he would have us preserved from being
{565}
high-minded; we are just of the same lump of clay as the most dreadful enemy of God there ever was. God's sovereign call has made the great difference; we have been called to be vessels upon whom God will make known the riches of His glory.
We are His people as redeemed. In @Exodus 15, Israel referred to themselves as "Thy people". God had taken them for Himself on the ground of redemption; He had put His wing over them in the passover, and brought them through the Red Sea. He had now a people who knew Him as their strength, their song and their salvation, and it was a pleasure to Him to have such a people. Then in @Exodus 19 He introduced the thought of a covenant; it was as much as to say, 'I want a definite bond to subsist between Myself and you'. The figure of marriage relationship is often used in connection with the covenant; it is a relationship of affection in which as knowing God and committed to Him in love we are in the place of being beloved of God. Those who have received Christ are beloved of God. Israel rejected Him, but we are beloved of God as having had our hearts opened to receive Him. Every first day of the week when we eat the Supper we are reminded that we are in the bond of the covenant -- "This cup is the new covenant in my blood". Then, finally, we are sons of the living God. God is glorifying Himself in the place which He gives His people before Him. They were, according to nature, of the same lump of clay as others, but as vessels to honour and vessels of mercy God glorifies Himself in them.
In 2 Timothy we read of vessels of gold and silver as coming into evidence in the last days. It is at the present time available to us to have this precious character. In this case the suggestion is that the vessels have intrinsic value. The thought is introduced of being vessels to honour in a distinctive way in the christian profession. Vessels to honour in @Romans 9 would take in all saints, but we could not say that every called one was a vessel to honour in the sense of 2 Timothy. I think the Lord would exercise us about being
{566}
vessels of gold and silver. As vessels of clay we learn what God is for us, and what Christ is for us, and in a sense what the Spirit is for us, but the vessels of gold and silver refer to what we may be as approved of God and as serviceable to the Master. It is not what divine Persons are for us, but what we are for divine Persons. It now becomes our exercise to be characterised by what is divine and spiritual. This is a great exercise. It has to be reached from our side, because it says, "If therefore one shall have purified himself from these, in separating himself from them, he shall be a vessel to honour, sanctified, serviceable to the Master, prepared for every good work" (verse 21). It works from the exercises of the individual; it is not exactly what God does for him, but what he does for himself. Most of us here are in a position of outward separation, but are we really vessels of gold and silver?
I think a gold vessel would be one who recognised the presence of the Spirit of God dwelling in him. No one could come to the recognition of that without a profound effect being produced in his whole moral constitution; he is no longer merely clay but gold. There comes a moment when a saint recognises that his body is the temple of the Holy Spirit.
In @Zechariah 4 we read of a lamp-stand all of gold, and golden tubes that empty the gold out of themselves, and when the prophet asks what is the meaning, the answer is, "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit". Gold in Scripture is figurative of what is divine, of what is of God.
The candlestick at the present time is a golden one; there is divine material there, otherwise there would be no divine light. If a saint recognises that he is indwelt by the Spirit of God there is something there altogether different from clay.
The assemblies in Revelation are seen as the lamp-stand; it is golden; nothing else could yield divine light. I think the recognition of the Spirit would constitute one a golden vessel. The true recognition of the Spirit must have far-reaching effects: it has liberated thousands of saints from human order.
Where the Spirit is recognised it brings in the truth of the
{567}
body, of the house, and of the anointing; it gives everything that is of God a place in the soul. There is something there which has intrinsic value, something which is of God made good in the soul of the believer.
There is a thought definitely connected in Scripture with silver which is not so prominent in connection with gold, and that is the thought of refining. There is not much in Scripture about the refining of gold; one scripture speaks of the altar of incense being made of refined gold; but the refining of silver is more often mentioned. Therefore silver vessels might suggest the result of a process of exercise of refining character. In @Proverbs 25: 4 we read, "Take away the dross from the silver, and there cometh forth a vessel for the refiner".
Vessels of gold and silver are in contrast with vessels of wood and earth, which would represent what persons are naturally. Vessels of wood and earth may be attractive in a natural way, but vessels to honour are of gold and silver -- gold as deriving character from the presence of the Spirit, and silver as having been refined by a process of exercise which has gone on under the eye of God which has had the effect of eliminating dross and bringing out vessels for the refiner.
Vessels to honour are for service; they are "vessels of service" (@Hebrews 9: 21). The end is not reached until they become "serviceable to the Master, prepared for every good work". To be separated from vessels to dishonour, and to meet together in a scriptural way and have enjoyable times, is not to be regarded as the end to which vessels to honour are to be devoted. The divine thought is that we come through spiritual exercises into separation that we may serve the Lord according to His pleasure -- that we may be absolutely at His disposal for service. This should ever be before us.
The Lord is sitting "as a refiner and purifier of silver; and he will purify the children of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver; and they shall offer unto Jehovah an oblation in
{568}
righteousness" (@Malachi 3: 3). We cannot be near the Lord without being refined, and the refining has in view our being purified so as to be acceptable in service. The spiritual condition set forth in vessels of gold and silver would qualify us to serve the Lord in purity, power and zeal more acceptable than anything that could be found apart from separation.
The prudent virgins are marked by having oil in their vessels; they are not content with having oil in their lamps only, representing their public witness, but they have also oil in their vessels. Themselves as vessels become characterised by the presence of the Spirit of God. Then as near the Lord the dross will be taken away; He will refine us so that we shall come forth a vessel, for the Refiner; we shall be sanctified and made in every way suitable for the service of the Lord. The true principle of separation is not merely that we stand apart from what is iniquitous and of human order, but that we do so that we may absolutely and devotedly serve the Lord. As gold and silver vessels we are to be absolutely for the pleasure of the Master, and nothing that is low or mean -- that has the character of wood or earth -- should be seen in us. We often, like the Corinthians, "walk according to man" (@1 Corinthians 3: 3), but that is wooden or earthen, not gold or silver. Paul wrote the first epistle to them so that through self-judgment they might acquire a truly precious character. In speaking of building he says, 'You who minister among the saints, mind what you are doing; do not build wood, grass and straw; that will not abide the fire. Rather build gold, silver, precious stones -- things that have divine and spiritual value -- so that the saints may acquire intrinsic value'.
While we may be thankful to know that we have received the Spirit on the ground of the value of the death of Christ, it is quite another thing so to recognise the Spirit that we take character from His presence. The Corinthians had received the Spirit, but they had not recognised the Spirit so as to be characterised by His presence; they were not spiritual. Paul was labouring that they might become vessels of gold and
{569}
silver; and I believe the Spirit is giving exercise at the present time that we may be found truly vessels to honour.
If we love God we shall desire to be found agreeable to Him. "Strive diligently to present thyself approved to God". If one loves the Lord one would like to be acceptable to Him for service, to be at His disposal, to be ready for every good work. We have probably not thought enough of service. What must it be to the Lord in the midst of such a corrupt state of things as exists in the christian profession now, in which even true believers are ensnared and hampered by human thoughts and arrangements, to have vessels to honour that are at His disposal for service, to serve His loved assembly in communion with Him, and also to be holy vessels of service in praise Godward. To be "vessels of service" is a distinction to be much coveted.
{570}
OUR RESPONSE TO GOD
@Romans 12: 1, 2
We may learn from @Romans 12: 1 that God looks for definite movement on the part of His saints toward Himself.
We are too apt generally to think of how God has moved in regard of us, and to rest in that which meets our need without considering what is due to God, and what a heart that loves Him would delight to do in movement towards Him. It is the *compassion* of God that moves the heart, not merely the grace presented in the gospel towards all, but the sense in the soul of sovereign mercy, so that each individual saint has the deep consciousness, 'God has had compassion on me'. It gives one a profound sense of distinguishing and electing mercy to which the heart loves to respond. But the response is most practical, for it is the *body* which is presented as a living sacrifice. It is not merely what is inward, but the *body* is given to God -- a free-will offering. When this presentation has once taken place God holds the saint to it. He holds us in love to our vow of dedication and we become subjects of discipline accordingly. Much of God's discipline is simply God holding His saints to their bond, if one may so say, and this is most blessed. God regards every one of His saints in the light of their best and most devoted day. The day of absolute dedication to God is ever cherished, we may say, in His memory as the true characteristic of His saint, and He affords all the help of His wisdom and love to make good in a practical way the desires of His saint's heart. In view of @Romans 12 the saint's body is "holy". It is no longer the vessel of the flesh, but of the Spirit, and is held for God's will. We never know how good and perfect and acceptable God's will is until we *prove* it, and the proving comes as we practically *do* it. All works from within; it is the renewing of *the mind* that leads to transformation. The outward flows from the inward.
{571}
THE MORAL BASIS FOR THE BODY OF CHRIST
@Romans 12: 1 - 8
C.A.C. As the truth of the place that the saints have as the body of Christ is a most distinctive truth, we thought it would be helpful to look at it together. We do not get the thought of the body of Christ in Romans; we get the moral basis for it.
Ques. What is that?
C.A.C. What stands in relation to the truth of the body, as the foundation does to a house. The foundation must correspond with the structure, otherwise the plan would be thwarted. At the close of this epistle the apostle speaks of God as One "able to establish you, according to my glad tidings and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery". The glad tidings preached by Paul correspond with the mystery, so the gospel if rightly presented would prepare us for the truth of the mystery -- what the church is as the body of Christ. The truth of the mystery was involved in the word said to Saul of Tarsus, "Why dost thou persecute me?" (@Acts 9: 4). I was thinking of the greatness of the thought in the mind of God; He kept it secret for many centuries, He kept it hid -- there was something of value that God could treasure. We all should be concerned to know this peculiar secret in the heart of God which was never known until the present period. The fact that Jesus would sit at God's right hand was not a mystery, that He would ascend and lead captivity captive was not a mystery, but the fact that His body was to be on the earth was hidden. We ought to be concerned that we understand it, and that we are in it in spiritual reality. I thought that Romans giving us the glad tidings, and securing to us the good of the Spirit was the moral basis for the body. The Spirit in the saints as life -- that is the moral basis of the truth of the body.
{572}
Rem. What is brought into evidence in the preaching of Paul's gospel is that it is a gospel very different from the relief of man. We get the Spirit indwelling and are able to say, "Abba, Father". As saints we should take to heart the immensity God has in view. Think what a testimony is going forth!
Ques. Speaking of what is distinctive as to the body, is it beyond the assembly?
C.A.C. The assembly is the body, but there is an aspect of the assembly as the congregation of God which does not go so far as the truth of the body. Is not the basis of it very much the preaching of Jesus Christ? That is the gospel. The first thing is that we are brought into line with God, and the means that God uses to bring us into line with Himself is the preaching of Jesus Christ. We all have noticed how prominent that title is in this epistle. He is the one Man for God.
God is causing that one Man to be preached so that He should become the one Man for us. He is before us as the one Man through whom grace, righteousness and life are available. Everything in the nature of blessing is stored in that one Man, in contrast with one man who brought in sin and death. We all know experimentally what was brought in by Adam; now God has brought in another Man, Jesus Christ. He is the Man God is presenting, showing the wonderful things that are secured in and through that Man. Those who believe the preaching of Jesus Christ come into line with God, and what is most wonderful of all is that if we come into line with God in that way, the Spirit of God can dwell in us; that is not the seal, or the earnest or the adoption; it is the Spirit of God dwelling in you, at home with you, for that is what dwelling means. If I believe the preaching of Jesus Christ, if I believe those glad tidings, I can understand all that is there in Jesus Christ, and I come into line with God; I appreciate the one Man as an Object of faith. Then the Spirit says, 'I can come and be at home with you'. Think of a company of persons on
{573}
this earth with whom the Spirit of God can be on such terms that He can come and dwell with them; it is fine! This is preparing us individually so that we can come to be one body *in* Christ. It is not the body of Christ in Romans, but one body *in* Christ.
Ques. It would be helpful if you would open that up to us. What is it to be one body in Christ?
C.A.C. There is a unity brought about in Christ that is altogether apart from Adam, the man after the flesh. A wonderful unity is brought about in Christ; that is the extent that we get in Romans. If we do not know what it is to be one body in Christ, we do know anything of the body. One body in Christ is moral unity.
Ques. Is the thought of the body to take me apart from Adam?
C.A.C. The point of harmony is one Man, Jesus Christ. I see more and more that we are not defective in top storeys but in foundation. There is nothing in the way of blessing outside one Man Jesus Christ. When we believe these glad tidings we are in such harmony with God that the Spirit can be at *home* with us; that is the idea of dwelling. If I believe in that one Man Jesus Christ, the Spirit can be at home with me. If you think of a company of persons on earth with whom the Spirit is at home, is not that wonderful? A company in harmony with Jesus Christ! We must distinguish between this and sealing; this is more than sealing. God may put His seal on me, or give me the earnest of what is coming, but the Spirit of God *dwelling* in us is something beyond; we do not think enough of it.
Ques. Is this a further thought than believing on Him as Saviour?
C.A.C. It is a more comprehensive thought. This is a wonderful basis of unity; we see a number of persons in whom the Spirit is complacent. Do we understand it? Can we each say, The Spirit of God is complacent with me? The
{574}
indwelling of the Spirit is the evidence of the complacency of God with those who come into harmony with Him. Every believer is a miniature of the whole.
Ques. Are individual exercises in view of the body?
C.A.C. This aspect we are speaking of comes out in the house, the habitation of God. Each individual's body is a little miniature of the universal idea of the temple; what is secured universally is seen in each believer. This is Paul's gospel; if he came here he would say, 'I have nothing better to tell you than that God has one Man Jesus Christ. He is risen from the dead; if you believe on Him all is yours. You come into the complacency of God, and His Spirit will be at home with you'. That is a good gospel; it is the gospel for the man in the street. There is no different gospel for the believer than for the sinner. When I preached I did not think of the company as some being believers and some sinners, I thought of them as men and women and I had got glorious news for them. I wanted them to understand it better than they did. If you preach the gospel and there are only believers there, you will find that they enjoy it immensely; their faces will shine. The gospel is something for men, women and children to believe. This is all of one piece with the mystery; it is fatal to think that the gospel is one thing and the assembly another; they are two departments of the same blessed grace, only, the gospel is for all men, and the truth of the assembly does not go beyond the saints. Then Paul goes on to say in @Romans 8, "If any one has not the Spirit of Christ *he* is not of him". Having the Spirit of Christ is a matter of consciousness; we are all conscious here tonight if we have the Spirit of Christ or not. There is no uncertainty about it. You *know* if you have the Spirit of Christ. Suppose you find yourself hard, unforgiving, discontented with your circumstances, grumbling and murmuring, you have no difficulty in judging that that is not the Spirit of Christ. Anybody with any christian life knows the marks of the Spirit of Christ. Suppose I have not the marks and am distressed about it, it drives me to
{575}
God. I tell God that I am grieved that there is so much about me that is not the Spirit of Christ. The very fact that I feel the contrariety is the proof I *have* the Spirit. If I go to God He will help me. If I have a spirit that is not of Christ and I go to Him, He will help me to get apart from it. The result of such exercises as these is that Christ is in the saints. All this is working towards the truth of the body. It is a wonderful moment when Christ gets a footing in us -- "Christ in you".
Ques. Would you distinguish between having the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of Him that raised Jesus from the dead?
C.A.C. That carries you to when the mortal body is quickened on account of the Spirit that dwells in us; it looks on to the complete result. Suppose I lose my temper, I feel very grieved and I go to God and confess it; that is the Spirit of Christ, I have the feelings of Christ inwardly. It is the Spirit of Christ that leads me to go to God about that ugly feeling. This is the moral basis in the soul of the individual believer. Christ has a footing in every believer; there was a time when Christ had no footing in us. We may not be well-developed Christians yet but Christ has a *footing* in us. The Spirit of God dwelling in you shows how God regards you, He can be on familiar terms with you. I remember someone saying to us when I was a boy, 'Boys, keep on good terms with the Spirit'. If we are in our true place with God the world will not trouble us, the gospel is to deliver us from the world, the flesh and the devil.
Ques. Christ gets a footing in @Romans 8; when does God get a footing?
C.A.C. He gets a footing when we believe the glad tidings of Jesus Christ. If Christ gets a footing He alters everything. He will not leave things as they were, but will revolutionise the whole moral being. The body is dead because of sin; we do not understand how greatly we are controlled by our bodies as natural men and women. What we eat, what we drink, what we wear -- all the pleasures of
{576}
the world centre round the gratification of the body, but if Christ gets a link what becomes of all that? The Spirit is life now.
Rem. Another Person is dominating now.
C.A.C. J.N.D. got into an argument once with a Jesuit priest; the priest argued that the Christian was to be a corpse moved by a stick, and the father confessor was the stick. J.N.D. said, I accept your figure but the stick must be the Spirit of God. The body is dead on account of sin; my body moving naturally must lead me to sin, but the Spirit is life on account of righteousness. This mortal body is now to be energised by the Spirit. This shows us the indispensability of the Spirit every day and every moment. The Christian has to work as everyone else, but how differently he does it. He does all on the principle of obedience and dependence and with reference to God. What maintains that vitally in the believer? The Spirit of God, so the Spirit is life on account of righteousness.
Ques. Is that the force of chapter 13?
C.A.C. That is the idea. The deeds of the body naturally can only be sin, but now a new power has come in to enable us to put to death the deeds of the body; the Christian thus becomes superior to the flesh. Some of us have tried to be dead to the flesh -- I did, so I can sympathise -- but Scripture proposes that we should be superior to the flesh. All this is so important because we cannot touch chapter 12 without it.
In chapter 12 we get the practical working of it out on sacrificial lines. Every bit of movement practically in reference to the service of God must be sacrificial, must cost something; there is no move on this line apart from sacrifice.
Rem. We are to be constantly facing things.
C.A.C. The principal secret of discontent among the people of God is that we have not found our place in relation to being one body in Christ; therefore we are trying to take a place that has not been given to us and that brings friction and discomfort. When we learn our allotted place we can
{577}
move on quietly, according to the measure of faith God has given to us, on the line of sacrifice and we can be supremely happy. Having learned experimentally chapter 8 we have this wonderful privilege of offering what God values more than anything else -- our body.
Rem. It shows that our body is worth something to God.
C.A.C. I should like to make clear for old and young the way the Spirit becomes life in the body; that is, the Spirit maintains obedience, subjection, etc. That is life. When the body is under the control of the Spirit everything is done on the line of obedience. If we keep shop, or go to the office, or whatever we have to do, we do it on the line of obedience. The Spirit maintains that; it is not an effort but the Spirit maintains it in the soul. We all know when we are in vitality Godward; our secret exercises make us fully assured whether we are going on with God and bringing Him into things or not. On this line we find the truest happiness; the thing is to keep our bodies on the altar. Now it is to be the will of God. Naturally we dread the will of God; we have a lurking feeling that we would not like to commit ourselves to God's will lest He might do something we did not like! That springs from the fangs of the serpent. But your body presented as a living sacrifice, the will of God is good, acceptable and perfect; you prove it so. You do not want any improvement, for your circumstances could not be improved. You have only to adapt yourself to the environment where God has set you and serve the brethren there. This truth as to the body is not an abstract thing; people talk of high truth, but in one sense it is the lowest truth, because it will search you to the roots of your moral being. When we get on to this line we find a measure of faith, and we have to work it out. There is something we have to do that is of service to the whole company as one body in Christ. It says in this chapter, "Each one members one of the other". God would give *me* a sense that I need you and cannot do without you, and He would give you a sense that you need *me*. This works out particularly
{578}
locally; if I am not supplying what other saints need what a gap there is! If I have a bit of value I want the brethren to get the good of it, and I want to get the good of what value is in the brethren. That is the one body in Christ, not exactly the body of Christ; it is the moral basis of all. We cannot go on to Ephesian truth if we have not got this.
{579}
THE RENEWAL OF THE MIND
@Romans 12: 2
On an earlier occasion we were considering the renewal of the Spirit: we were seeing that it is the most important part of that action of mercy by which we are saved. The renewal of the Holy Spirit would perhaps give one the greatest conception of renewal that is possible; one could not conceive anything greater. Indeed it is very comforting and blessed to see that the things the gospel brings to us as divine gifts are the greatest things of all. All the wonderful things which God has bestowed on us -- the gift of the Spirit, salvation, eternal life, the children's place, sonship, the inheritance -- these are the greatest things in Scripture: and yet they are all the gift of the love of God, given because God would give them and nothing else would suit His mind. So the greatest things are, in a sense, common to all saints, by the gift of divine love. The renewal of the Holy Spirit is poured on us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour, and it is by that we are saved.
I thought it would be helpful if we looked now at the subject of the renewal of the mind. It seems to me that the renewal of the mind is something subsequent to the gift of the Spirit: it is the result of moral exercises that are consequent on the gospel being known and the Spirit received. In the epistle to the Romans the mind is spoken of in three distinct ways. The first is in chapter 1: 28, "According as they did not think good to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind to practise unseemly things". There we see the reprobate mind; it is the judicial consequence of men having determined that it was not well to have God in their knowledge. This was universal in the heathen world; men did not consider it well to have God in their knowledge, and so God judicially gave them up to a
{580}
reprobate mind, a mind void of moral discernment, and the result was they did all kinds of unseemly things. The doing of these things was the result of the state of their minds. I want you to note this, because our doing right depends on the condition of our minds, it is the result of the renewing. Their conduct was the result of the reprobate mind. I trust none of us are in that state; I assume that no one here has a reprobate mind.
In chapter 7: 22 we find another sort of mind, "I delight in the law of God according to the inward man: but I see another law in my members, warring in opposition to the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which exists in my members". We might speak of that as the 'exercised mind'. It is a mind that is exercised towards God and towards what is good. The law that is in that mind, the fixed principle that works there, is the desire to do what is right and pleasing to God; so we can speak of it as the exercised mind. But we find there is another law in that person besides the law of the mind, and that is the law in his members, the law of sin; and practically the law of sin always gets the upper hand. He wants to do right, but there is a power too strong for him. It is an exercised mind but we could not speak of it scripturally as a renewed mind. It is a man who does not know the grace of the gospel, he is not in the good of deliverance and liberty. There may be some here with exercised minds; they would like to do what is right and to please God, but there is another power working, and to their grief and sorrow it generally gets the upper hand.
In chapter 12 we come to the 'renewed mind', we find there is a transforming power connected with it. "Be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God" (verse 2). Instead of proving your own weakness and failure you prove what is good and acceptable and perfect, and that is the will of God. It is in doing it that you prove it, you never prove anything until you do it.
{581}
Many people read their bibles, and see blessed things in Scripture, but they never prove anything because they do not step out on the path of doing them: it is then we prove them. I am speaking of elementary things because I have come to the conclusion that most of our defects lie at the foundation, we are weak there. Certain great principles have never been laid in our souls, and the result is we are spiritually weak and defective all through. We have to get in contact with these great spiritual realities which belong to us, our true portion, the things in which all our blessing consists. They are not things which do not belong to us; we are not trespassers when we take them up: we are taking up our divinely given property, our birthright.
The epistle to the Romans unfolds things that would bring about the renewing of the mind; it is the result of moral exercises brought about under the influence of grace. The character of divine grace is unfolded to us in this epistle: we do not get it so blessedly anywhere else. God would bring our minds under the influence of this blessed grace in which He has dealt and is dealing with us; and the result of that influence operating in our minds would be -- a complete renewal of our thoughts, discernments and judgments about everything we might have to do with. It is a mind that is not weak like the man's mind in chapter 7 which did not transform him. The renewed mind is an effective mind which is able to bring about that the man is transformed.
We might speak of an immense number of things in this epistle, but I want to call attention to five words which seem to me to concentrate the moral influences which God would bring to bear on us to renew our minds. They are: grace, support, power, purpose and compassion. A great many other words could be found to have an important place in the teaching of this epistle, but I should like to keep to these five words. They embody divine influence by which God would renew our minds; He would give us an entirely new ability to think, discern and estimate things.
{582}
The first word is grace. God says, "we are ... under grace"; it is a definite statement. "We are not under law but under grace" (chapter 6: 15). It is an immense influence. The grace of God is something we did not deserve at all, we did nothing for it. Everything that grace bestows -- and the epistle speaks of abundance of grace -- is, all the favour of God, bestowed by God without any claim, or merit, or reason on our side. We are justified freely by His grace, cleared from every charge, He has dismissed from His mind every accusation. He holds us clear, not a spot or stain, every accusing voice is silenced. What a blessed influence to be brought to bear on our minds, an entirely new impression of God, that He is dealing with us in grace because of what He is. We have peace with God because every question is settled; Christ is risen and He is our righteousness. None of us who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ could be improved as to righteousness, because a risen Christ is our righteousness. Grace did it. Grace has given us that risen glorious Man in all His suitability to God, and to that resurrection world in which He has entered: He is our righteousness. How has it come to pass? Grace did it, and we have received abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness. God would influence us by it.
Then the second word is support. I connect this with chapter 7, where we are told that we have "been made dead to the law by the body of the Christ, to be to another, who has been raised up from among the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God" (verse 4). The idea there is that instead of being linked up with law, which made continual demands and gave no support, we are put in relation to Christ, who is a perpetual source of support; and by His support He can make us fruitful to God. Instead of demand we have always a source of supply. Have we all got that sense? Many believers have a continual sense of demand, as if God required what they could not render, a sense of deficiency, that they cannot keep up to the mark. God would encourage us in the sense of
{583}
having a divine Person, One who has been raised from the dead, who can give us every conceivable support that we require; One we can count on who will never fail us. Instead of law making demands we have a Person who supplies everything, who is a continual source of enrichment and supply. And we can have His companionship too. God would bring us under the influence of all this: it is by these things He renews the mind. God gives us a new outlook, a new estimate, the discernment of mind in accordance with what He has presented to us in His grace. What a renewal of thoughts and discernments of the mind!
The third word I spoke of was power. The Spirit indwells, and that we get in chapter 8. It is wonderful that the Spirit should be indwelling the saints, and that He should be there in the way of power. He is there to shed the love of God abroad in our hearts (chapter 5), and He is there to lead us into sonship, "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, *these* are sons of God" (chapter 8: 14). But He has come in as power, so if "ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live" (chapter 8: 13). There is power to do it by the Spirit; the Spirit is life with a view to righteousness. I should like my own heart to be more engaged with the blessed realities of what grace has conferred.
Then in chapter 8 we get another word, purpose. We are brought under the influence of all God has for us in purpose. He is going to have us conformed to the image of His Son; we are going to be like Christ. A young soul just converted is entitled to go out of the room where he was brought to Christ, with the joy of this filling his heart. What an impression it would make on a young soul -- I am going to be like Christ! Nothing can hinder it because it is the purpose of God that He may be the "firstborn among many brethren" (verse 29). God wants us to have that before our hearts. All these things put us quite outside this present age: we could not imagine a greater contrast than between these things and all we could find in this age. To be conformed to this age is to
{584}
lose every divine feature, but God seeks that we should be transformed by the renewing of our minds; and if our minds are under the influence that we are going to be like Christ it would have a wonderfully transforming power. Everything works from within. It is not imposing rules and regulations on one another, and setting up standards of what we ought to be, but God works by bringing the influence of the whole system of grace to bear on our minds so that they might be renewed.
The last word I spoke of was compassion. The epistle does not end at chapter 8: we are brought there to touch purpose, glory and conformity to Christ, God's Son; and then the apostle turns aside, as we know, and speaks from chapters 9 to 11 on the line of sovereignty, God's absolute sovereignty; and he brings out the fact that all blessing for man must be the result of divine compassion. I do not think anything could so affect the mind as that. All the grace of God presented in Christ would be nothing to me as to true value if God had not had compassion on me. Every one of us is the subject of divine compassion or we should never have come into blessing at all. This gives one such a sense of absolute indebtedness to God, of being shut up to Him in His sovereign compassion: nothing else subdues the mind and heart. I have often said that the only one spoken of in @Hebrews 11 as a worshipper is Jacob, and he was the man of all others who had to learn true divine sovereignty; it made him a worshipper. The end of @Romans 11 is very like worship: the apostle after speaking of divine sovereign compassion breaks out in worship to God.
These are the things that have an intense application to every believer: God brings them to bear on us in order to renew our minds, and we begin to discern and judge of things in the light of these realities. It is brought about through exercise, and the result is we are brought into entire separation in mind from this present age.
The secret of all the trouble with man is he did not want to retain God in his knowledge. Now through grace and mercy
{585}
we do want Him to have a place, and He has a place, and as we allow these blessed things to affect our minds they become renewed. We have a new way of looking at everything in relation to God and to the way God has blessed us in His sovereignty; we are subdued and humbled, and our hearts lifted up in praise to God. One in that condition is ready to be transformed. A person is affected inwardly first and then transformed -- "Be not conformed to this world, but be transformed" -- transformed or transfigured: it means an outward change fitting us for earth. A people who once carried the features of lawless men are now to carry the features of creatures subject to God, qualified to prove what a blessed thing the will of God is. The devil has been telling us for six thousand years what a terrible thing the will of God is, but the Christian proves how good, and acceptable, and perfect it is.
Presenting our bodies a living sacrifice is done once for all, but no doubt it has a continuous consequence and result. It is on the line of divine entreaty, "I beseech you ... by the compassions of God". It is not His grace, a deeper note is touched here, it is by the compassions of God. That is the sovereignty which has singled you out and left your neighbour, left people out far more fit for blessing than you. "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the compassions of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your intelligent service". It is done once and never recalled; but I think the exhortations are always of force: for instance I may need practically to be exhorted today to present my body because I may have got away from the principle of it, but it is supposed to have been done once for all. Transformation goes on continually: the mind is not renewed once for all.
Perhaps we have known something of the things we have been speaking of, but every time we dwell on them they take a new character and greatness. Paul said, "To write the same things to you, to me is not irksome, and for you safe" (@Philippians 3: 1). There is nothing lost in going over and over the same
{586}
things: it is not vain repetition. Take an illustration. If you see a man driving a screw it goes round and round, and a person who does not understand might say, You are doing the same thing over and over again. Yes, says the man, but it goes deeper every time. So it is in divine things: they go deeper, they get more hold on our spirits. We go home after a meeting to thank the Lord for what He has brought before us, and to pray that it may go deeper. None of us are renewed in an absolute sense; if absolutely renewed we should be absolutely transfigured, and nothing would be seen in us but the will of God. Our countenances do not shine as the sun; none of us are like that yet. Nothing is absolute on our side; on the divine side everything is absolute. On our side we have to learn everything partially -- here a little and there a little -- "We know in part, and we prophesy in part: ... we see now through a dim window obscurely" (@1 Corinthians 13: 9, 12). There is no arriving at finality while we are here, so practically renewing goes on, and transforming too. If I get an impression of God it gives me a new outlook, and that has to work out practically in transformation. People excuse a thing by saying everybody does it. I should say, if everybody does it that is enough to condemn it! That is like the course of this age, an age that does not consider God at all, does not admit that God has a right to have any personal influence at all. But the saint loves that his mind should be under the influence of the blessed realities in which grace has blessed him, and the light into which he is brought gives him a new outlook on everything. Then transformation has begun; he takes a different course in his business, and in his family: there is a transfiguring power. Transformed is the same word as is used of the Lord, "He was transfigured before them" (@Matthew 17: 2; @Mark 9: 2). We all know what it was with Him, a complete change in His outward appearance. The Christian is to come out in something of the true glory of the place in which he has been set by divine grace: it is the result of the renewing. Grace is the spring of all this.
{587}
There are many other things -- the love of God, the love of Christ -- many different powerful influences brought to bear. The disciples saw the kingdom of God in power. The epistle to the Romans is the epistle of the kingdom of God, and I think the kingdom of God is to be seen in the saints. It was once seen in the Lord Jesus, a blessed Man in absolute dependence, who was here only for the will of God, supported from heaven, directed from heaven, knowing His place in the love of God and living in it -- the kingdom of God was seen there. We have been brought under the influence of all these things we have been speaking of; they are all known in the kingdom of God. Divine power, divine support are known there; the purpose of God, His compassions are known there; and the result is the saints are to come out as subjects of the kingdom, marked by righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit -- that is transformation. The will of God is good, and acceptable, and perfect; it is just the contrast to everything in this present age; it brings the soul under the influence of what belongs to the age to come. Salvation can be spoken of absolutely on the divine side -- according to His mercy He has saved us -- but on our side it has to be entered into through moral exercise, and coming under the influence of the things which are presented to us in this epistle. The result is the renewing of the mind and the transforming; we are not conformed to this age. Our bodies can be regarded as acceptable, they become such as God finds acceptable. We prove "what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God".

NOTES OF A READING
@Romans 15: 18 - 33
C.A.C. It is noticeable how the apostle brings everything into this epistle, we get everything suggested in it.
Rem. The foundations are great and comprehensive enough for the superstructure.
C.A.C. Well, they involve the superstructure. So in this epistle the kingdom of God really secures everything, and I suppose the truth of the kingdom of God is the great truth of the epistle. Thus one of the last things spoken of is the testimony of the glad tidings.
Ques. Why the last?
C.A.C. Well, it is noticeable that it is so. The kingdom of God results in that, in universal evangelising. It is good to get the general setting of the epistle before us.
Chapters 3, 4 and 5 are seeing the kingdom of God; they involve new birth.
Chapters 6, 7 and 8 are entering into the kingdom of God; that requires being born of water and of the Spirit, and the presence of the Spirit.
In chapters 12 - 15, it is how it all works out in every sphere of life; that is, in how the saints behave as one body in Christ, in relation to the powers that be, in regard to the weak believer, one weak in the faith and having scruples, and it does not stop short of the service of God, God being praised with one mouth and one voice; and Christ singing praise in the midst of the Gentiles, and the Levites being offered up to God, that great wave-offering of the Gentiles -- it seems to widen out, and then finally the glad tidings going out universally.
Rem. I suppose the more we grow in the knowledge of God the more universal our outlook is, and the more intense our desire that men should know God.
{589}
C.A.C. Yes. The apostle does not tell *them* to evangelise everybody, but he tells them what he does himself, he leads the way. It is helpful to notice that he secures God's portion first, the saints being unified in the praise of God.
Ques. Would you say the service of God comes before the gospel?
C.A.C. Some of us when we were young had an idea that if we had a good morning meeting the preaching would be all right, and it was a good idea. What you find in this epistle is that everything is secured because the assembly is secured and its service; because, though not formally there, it is there in substance. It is beautiful to think of the apostle going out with this great service to secure the Gentiles and offering them, as Aaron waved the Levites before God -- because he is the great Aaron of this dispensation, waving the Levites before God. It has in view that God should be known in the hearts of men so that they cannot help breaking forth in united praise and glory to God.
Rem. If the preacher has not the service of God primarily in view, the gospel will fall short of the purpose of God.
C.A.C. Those who do not consider for the service of God cannot present the fulness of the gospel of Christ. The confidence of Paul is delightful. "I know ... I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of Christ". He has absolute confidence. What God is going to get is what governs him.
Ques. Would "the fulness of the blessing of Christ" be greater than 'the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of the Christ'?
C.A.C. It seems to centre things more in the Person of Christ.
Rem. Would this not be what Paul did at Philippi in the prison? He was concerned that God should get His portion, and then men came into blessing.
Ques. Are these signs and wonders initial?
C.A.C. I think it is the remarkable testimony that God gave at the beginning, so manifest in signs and wonders there
{590}
was no getting over it. That is, it was evident there was a power there for the deliverance of man, it was seen outwardly. It was for the obedience of the nations -- with that in view. So in @Acts 4 they prayed that God would stretch forth His hand to heal, and so forth.
Rem. This was a very big circuit.
C.A.C. Yes, and he now has the ends of the earth before him, for Spain was the limit of the Roman world.
Ques. Would you think that he refrained from building on another's foundation because he recognised his service had a peculiar touch and character about it?
C.A.C. Yes, I thought so. He preferred to start at the beginning. It is extraordinary that he can take the place of having fully preached the gospel in this small area; it shows what a small part of Paul's service has been recorded. We know in our day how difficult it is to help souls that have had a bad start. There are those men going about preaching the gospel who have not been sent. Paul says, "As a wise architect, I have laid the foundation". He knew then it had been properly laid; he could not have spoken in confidence of the work of others.
Ques. Many have been wrongly instructed in the gospel, would you say?
C.A.C. Most of the difficulties believers have today arise from their ignorance of the gospel!
Ques. Was it preached right in the first place?
C.A.C. Yes -- by the apostles. But if souls have been damaged by a defective gospel it is not at all easy to get them into line for the service of God. Normally the glad tidings secure a company of persons so full of joy in God in the power of the Spirit that they must break forth in praise to Him, and the substance of their praise is Christ and all that God is bringing in through Christ. How can anyone take part in the service of God if he does not know that he is in Christ? A vast majority of believers have no notion of what it means to be in Christ.
{591}
Rem. You could go on building on that, it would not be a defective gospel.
C.A.C. You might have to go on clearing away a good deal of rubbish, before building on that. Souls need to be instructed in Christ, in the truth of His Person. "Aiming to announce the glad tidings, not where -- Christ has been named". I suppose that an evangelist would instinctively seek to work on this line, he would try to find people who did not know the gospel at all.
Rem. Virgin soil would produce a better crop.
C.A.C. No one is in the good of the gospel till he knows in the power of the Spirit that he is in Christ and that Christ is in him; and until he knows that, he could not possibly have liberty Godward.
Ques. What do we understand ourselves by being in Christ?
C.A.C. I think we learn first through the glad tidings that we are in Christ for righteousness, that we have a righteousness that could not possibly be improved upon. All centres in a living Person now glorified in heaven; it could not possibly be improved upon. It was a good day for us when we learnt that.
Rem. So that faith is in the Person rather than the work.
C.A.C. 'I am trusting in the finished work of Christ' is a very common answer, but trusting in the finished work of Christ will not give you the consciousness of being in Christ, and I would not like to say such have the Spirit.
Rem. "In whom we have redemption through his blood" (@Ephesians 1: 7).
C.A.C. And, "In whom" we are sealed. Paul's gospel was a wonderful gospel; it concerned a risen and glorified Man.
Rem. Otherwise I should fall into the grievous error of bettering myself.
C.A.C. It is quite a different thing to be set up in a different Man altogether. I am not set up in myself, but in
{592}
a Man that never *did* sin! All is in the value of the work of Christ, but in Scripture faith is usually connected with Persons: with God or with Christ. It is not believing statements or things, but coming into contact with divine Persons, so that these Persons are the object of faith. The result of the death of Christ is, we can be in Christ and we can have the Holy Spirit. It is the death of Christ that is the foundation for both. Trusting in the finished work of Christ might take us as far as thanksgiving. And God has provided perfectly for His own satisfaction, and those that believe and receive the Spirit He brings into His own satisfaction.
Rem. "Who by him do believe on God, who has raised him from among the dead and given him glory, that your faith and hope should be in God" (@1 Peter 1: 21). That takes the soul completely outside itself and places it with God.
C.A.C. Then he speaks of the contribution made for the saints at Jerusalem. That was an active result of the kingdom of God being set up, the natural selfishness of the natural mind displaced and believers made willing to contribute to those in need in far-off lands. It is remarkable that he does not say to the Romans that they should have a collection for them; he leaves it entirely to them. I dare say at the first care meeting after, they said to one another, Those Greeks have been sending to Jerusalem and we had better do a bit! In the New Testament, giving is left entirely to their own option.
Rem. It is really the principle of the heart offering, according as every man's heart prompted him.
C.A.C. It is contemptible the way christendom is after people to get money out of them.
Rem. It is remarkable that the Gentile contributed to the Jew, thus the other way round; it shows the fruit of the gospel.
Rem. It speaks of participation in, there is a sort of mutuality in it.
Rem. There is a sharing of what belonged to all.
C.A.C. There is the principle of equality, which is a great principle with God. There will probably be more room
{593}
for that if the Lord does not come soon. This is the fruit of Paul's ministry taking form practically, it is the one body tangibly. It was a test to the Gentiles to give, and it was a great test to the poor Jews to receive the gift. There was every possibility that they would spurn it, and the apostle felt that (verses 30, 31).
Ques. "The love of the Spirit" (verse 30) -- does it refer to it in the saints, or as a divine Person?
C.A.C. My own impression is it refers to the love that the Spirit produced in the hearts of the saints. He brings in our Lord Jesus Christ and then "by the love of the Spirit". It is what these divine Persons would bring about in the hearts of the saints. It was a great binding together of saints, and we have seen something of it in our times; the affection of our brethren in other lands has gone beyond our needs.
Ques. Would you say it was never comely to refuse any ministration offered to us?
C.A.C. It is difficult sometimes to know what to do even on that line.
Rem. If divine love prompts to give, divine love would prompt to receive.
C.A.C. Yes, that is just as it ought to be. Sometimes there is a reason not to receive. The apostle said once he would rather die than receive a gift from some. It needs grace on both sides, but on both sides the glory of God is the great end in view. God is to be glorified in the receiving as well as in the giving.
Rem. In the first epistle of John it is found in its setting.
{594}
NOTES OF A READING
@Romans 16: 1 - 27
Rem. I should like to refer to the question again as to "the love of the Spirit", whether it has reference to Him as a divine Person, or as a feature of the Spirit in the saints?
C.A.C. Perhaps we might bring both thoughts into it. The Spirit does love, because the Spirit is God, and God is love, and we need not leave out that thought surely; but I should suppose that Paul was thinking of the love that the Spirit produces. A divine Person who is here and dwelling in the saints is a Person who loves and therefore is producing an animating cause for love in those in whom He dwells, and this chapter reminds us very definitely that christianity is a matter of persons, not a system of teaching as people think. All that has come to pass in divine working in the kingdom of God comes out in persons, and I have no doubt this chapter is to bring that out, for about forty persons are named here. Is it not very affecting that each saint is an extraordinary person? We used to hear a while ago about 'common people', but God does not have that kind of thing, every saint is of an extraordinary nature, he is part of the greater things that have come in through the death and ascension of Christ and the descent of the Spirit. The Lord said the Father would show Him greater things than these, and He is doing it at the present time -- much greater things than anything on earth yet known. He is showing them to the Son and the Son is showing them to us by the Spirit. Sometimes it is said the saints speak too much of themselves, but I have always found they do not think enough of themselves. The great object of Scripture is to show us how great we are as in Christ, and as indwelt by the Spirit. So no saint is lost in a crowd.
Rem. It speaks of the stars and that He calls them by name. In a certain sense the apostle views the saints as stars.
{595}
C.A.C. Yes, and the sisters are not left out -- nine sisters are mentioned.
Rem. I suppose this is the scriptural example of a letter of commendation.
C.A.C. I think it would be so.
Ques. Have you any thought as to why the reference is to the assembly so much in this chapter?
C.A.C. Well, I thought it was to show that though the epistle generally deals with what is individual, it supposes the saints are walking together in assembly conditions, and so we get the five references in the last chapter to indicate that they are so regarded.
Rem. I think that is important, that the result of the epistle would be to leave us with that; because the assembly is the great end in view.
C.A.C. If all are one body (chapter 12) and indwelt by the Spirit, well, you have the assembly.
Ques. What is the spiritual force of "Amen"?
C.A.C. I suppose it is really, "So be it". It is the word the Lord uses many times when He says, "Verily".
Ques. Does it suggest fulfilment?
C.A.C. Yes. When we say 'Amen' do we not commit ourselves to what has been said?
Rem. Every divine thought for men is verified in Christ.
C.A.C. Yes.
Ques. What do we understand by a salutation, it is very frequent in this chapter?
C.A.C. I suppose it is an expression of spiritual affection. It says of the Lord as Priest that He was saluted of God. It reads in the margin, Saluted of God as high priest according to the order of Melchisedec (@Hebrews 5: 10). It is the recognition by God of Him in that office. I suppose if we salute the saints, we accord them the place due to them in the divine thought. They saluted the saints at Rome as called of God and set up in Christ and in the Lord. And all are not alike; I think it implies that the grace of God is all-varied and
{596}
comes out in different ways, and it is our privilege to recognise it where we see it.
Ques. Would you say a word about "worthily of saints" in verse 2?
C.A.C. Well, saints should surely be very ready to recognise the grace of God and the work of God as it comes before them in saints. And they were to help Phoebe in any way she needed.
Ques. How would you distinguish between this and Gaius setting forward the brethren on their journey "worthily of God" (@3 John 6)?
C.A.C. Well, they were brethren engaged in the Lord's work, but Diotrephes opposed them; *he* was not acting worthily of God. They were to be duly recognised as the Lord's servants and therefore honoured and helped.
Ques. Do you think this is a kind of pattern of a letter of commendation?
C.A.C. You mean he said nothing but what was true? A sister who had served the assembly and been a helper of many and even of Paul -- she deserved a good letter! It shows what a position a sister may have.
Rem. He ranks Priscilla and Aquila almost on the same level.
C.A.C. Yes.
Rem. I suppose it is well that the letter should be really a testimony to the bearer and not to the writer; sometimes it is a tribute to a fluent writer.
C.A.C. That is so.
Rem. The point is the assembly; namely the assembly's service.
C.A.C. In Aquila and Priscilla there was a personal devotion to Paul who was minister of the assemblies. They had understood what he had said at the end of the chapter, no doubt, that he linked the mystery with the gospel; that is, I suppose Paul's gospel includes the mystery.
Rem. He had had dealings some time or other outside Rome with those mentioned in this chapter.
{597}
C.A.C. I suppose so. He speaks of one brother, Epaenetus, who is the first-fruits of Asia. He must have come into touch with him at some time or other there and he was converted, and now this beautiful touch is brought in that he is the first-fruits of Asia *for Christ*. So the assembly is not only of Christ and in Christ, but *for Christ*- something in a practical and blessed way *for* Christ. (He was, I suppose, writing this from Corinth -- at the close of the epistle he was just about to go up with the offering of the saints from Macedonia and Achaia to Jerusalem.) "For Christ", that is the first feature that should mark the assembly as convened. Its first feature is not that it is for God, but for Christ. I was thinking that when we come together it is to eat *the Lord's supper*, and the emblems suggest the Lord to us, and if we rightly eat the Supper we should realise the assembly is for Christ. It leads on to His taking it up for the service of God, but we should not take that up rightly unless we realise first it is for Christ. We sometimes go on to what it is for God, when we have not reached what it is for Christ, and it does not prosper, it is not pleasing to divine Persons. And He is going to present the assembly *to* Himself.
Rem. We can understand the assemblies being thankful that Paul's life was saved.
C.A.C. We have all reason to be thankful that Paul's life was not cut short before Colossians and Ephesians and Philippians were written. It would have been a bad job for us if he had been killed then!
I think the Lord has been helping us for many years as to this, that it is so that Christ is for the assembly and the assembly for Christ. The Supper presents to us Christ for the assembly, and the spiritual answer to that is that the assembly is for Christ, and if the conditions are there He comes to us, and we ought to recognise Him as coming to us. The saints are unified by their thoughts of Christ. If we took the Supper spiritually there would not be a divergent thought, we should be unified, and if so we should be for Christ. We really come to the wonderful new place we have
{598}
on the ground of the death of Christ, which no saint ever had before and never will have after we are gone. It is not a question of what has been removed by His death -- atonement or propitiation; if that is in our mind we do not understand the Supper one bit! It is the Lord in death, the loaf and the cup both present that, but He was in death that an entirely new order of things should be brought in, and as we apprehend that, we apprehend we are of Christ. We shall never apprehend 'for Christ' unless we apprehend we are 'of Christ'. The life which we have is the result of His death. Andronicus and Junias had the advantage over Paul; they had come to the truth of what it was to be in Christ before him. It is the result of His death, a new position no one ever had before.
Ques. Do we come together to be 'for Him', having no preconceived thoughts, but simply that before us?
C.A.C. Yes.
Rem. We are quite clear and in a known relationship, everything having been cleared up; our love goes out to Him and we desire to be for Him.
C.A.C. Yes, so that there might be a company to which He can come, which is what characterises this time in the heart and mind of Christ, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you". In the activity of His love He comes to His own; and what happens when He comes to them must be realised.
Rem. Should this not be so *before* we come? We do not want to think of ourselves at all.
C.A.C. And we should understand that we are together entirely on the ground of His death, not on the ground of what it has removed, but on the ground of what has come in entirely new; that is, we are the fruit of His death, as it says, "Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, it abides alone; but if it die, it bears much fruit" (@John 12: 24) -- so not one thought of what we are as children of Adam remains in our mind. It is a great pleasure to the Lord to see
{599}
us enter into that, and that we should take on the character of the assembly, because the assembly lives of Him, it has His life.
Rem. The passover comes first, so that we are free to be for Christ; our side has been settled and we are free to be for Him.
C.A.C. You would say, the passover settles all the old? I think that is true.
Rem. He takes away the first that He may establish the second (@Hebrews 10: 9).
