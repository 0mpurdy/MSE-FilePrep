{#Volume 29 - An Outline of John's Gospel}
{1}
"THE WORD"
@John 1: 1
Our Lord's precious designation, "the Word", brings out how the mind of God has been fully and intelligibly communicated in Him. "God having spoken in many parts and in many ways formerly to the fathers in the prophets, at the end of these days has spoken to us in the person of the Son", @Hebrews 1: 1, 2. All was truly there in the divine mind from eternity but the wonder and glory of the present time is that it has come into expression. The Greek, 'Logos' (Word) signifies this. J.N.D. has defined its meaning thus, 'Whatever is the expression of a thought formed in the mind, and otherwise unknown; hence used for the thing expressed, or the expression of it ... . It is the matter and form of thought and expression, as well as the utterance of it ... . Whatever expresses the mind is 'logos''. 'Nous' is the intelligent faculty; whatever expresses the thought formed in it is 'logos'. (See the note to @1 Corinthians 1:5 in the Darby translation; see the whole note). What should arrest attention is that God, and all that is in His mind relative to men, has come into expression so as to be intelligently apprehended. Nothing could be more wondrous.
The title, "the Word", conveys to us what Christ the Son is as the glorious Person in whom is expressed the mind and heart of God. It is thus a very distinctive and comprehensive appellation, as perhaps covering a wider and more profound apprehension of Him than any other title that attached to Him. It is not a name of relationship like 'Son', not an official title like 'the Christ', but it is a designation which indicates the greatness of what is
{2}
expressed in Him. The blessedness of God was in perfect expression in Him, and this is greater than anything else. It involves His full Deity in perhaps a more absolute way than any other of His titles. Who could be the full expression of God, and of God's mind, save One who was Himself an eternal divine Person? Hence John, writing by inspiration of the Spirit, selects this appellation to designate Him as existing from eternity. Some title must be used, and we may be sure that "the Word" was more suitable to be used in that connection than any other. But John writes, as Luke does also, from the standpoint that the Word had been known as having become flesh, and dwelling among men. Men had been privileged to be "eyewitnesses of and attendants on the Word", @Luke 1: 2.
If Luke and John had not thus known "the Word", neither of them would ever have written gospels. Christ has become known as "the Word" to these two blessed men of God -- doubtless to thousands of others, but these two witnesses will suffice to prove that He was known to men, and spoken of by men, as "the Word". Now John has told us, by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, that the Person thus known, and thus spoken of, was an eternal Person, and was God. He was in the beginning, and was with God and was God. But it was One known to John, and many others, as "the Word" who was in the beginning, and who was with God and was God. This is the whole point of what is stated. It is the assertion in unmistakable terms of the eternal pre-existence and Deity of Him who is now known to us as "the Word". To say that He was "the Word" in eternity only raises questions as to what was expressed in Him in eternity, and to whom was it expressed; questions impossible to answer, for Scripture is silent on the matter. But the certainty that the One now known as "the Word" was eternally God is of the greatest and most vital importance. It bows the soul
{3}
before Him in most profound reverence and intensifies the desire that the vast import of His title, "the Word", shall be known now in spiritual reality and power in our hearts. There is immense gain in this and I am sure that the enemy would, if possible, divert us from it by any and every means.

THE MINISTRY OF JOHN AS CONNECTED WITH "BEGINNINGS"
@John 1:1 - 3; @1 John 1:1 - 4; @1 John 2:24,25
It is with the thought of having before us something of the precious ministry of the apostle John that I have suggested reading these portions of Scripture. I am sure we have all noticed how much John had before him the thought of "the beginning"; his whole ministry stands connected with certain beginnings. He commences his gospel by speaking of a beginning which is previous to time, previous to creation, and which goes back to the uncreated and eternally divine. Before anything was made God was; and "in the beginning" of @John 1:1 takes us back to what was antecedent to all creative acts of God.
In speaking of the Lord as "the Word" John was using a well-known designation; he was not introducing it for the first time; it was a designation which Luke had applied to Christ probably at least thirty years before John wrote (see @Luke 1:2). Every reader of Luke's gospel -- and by the time that John wrote his gospel this probably included saints in every assembly -- was familiar with the title "the Word". It is perhaps the most comprehensive title of the Lord that can be used apart from saying that He is God. For it conveys the wondrous thought that God is in expression so as to be known by intelligent creatures. There is thus a range and depth of meaning in this title which has a fulness beyond what is conveyed by any other. Indeed this is directly affirmed by the scripture which says, "Thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name", @Psalm 138:2. "Word", as used in that verse, does not answer exactly to the Greek word 'logos', but as it fixes the mind
{5}
more especially on what is expressed (see note on the same word as used in @Psalm 119:11 in the Darby Translation); it does bring out the exceeding greatness of what expresses God. So that we can understand how great is the thought conveyed when Luke speaks of some as having been "eyewitnesses of and attendants on the Word", @Luke 1:2. It was a glorious designation, and was used because it was so. The marvel of all marvels was that a divine Person should be here as Man, and should be known to men as the Word.
God has been expressed here in the fullest possible way in His nature and character, and in His thoughts of love towards men. Jesus as the Word was the intelligible expression of all that was in the mind and heart of God to make known of Himself to men. Creation shows God's skill and wisdom, His eternal power and divinity, but it does not express Him morally, any more than a beautiful watch expresses the character and nature of the watchmaker. But a divine Person has become Man in order to express God to men. John was full of this, as well he might be. He was writing of a Person known to him and many others as One in whom had been expressed all that in which God could be known by men. And it seemed good to John, and to the Holy Spirit, to use this known title of the Lord (attaching to Him as here on earth, according to @Luke 1:2) when he referred to Him as in the past eternity. "The Word" was identified with His Person in the mind of John; it was of that known Person he was writing. He would have us to know the infinite divine greatness and majesty of the One concerning whom he was going to write. It had been reserved to him to bring out what that Person was as the Word much more fully than it had been brought out before. If we want to appreciate that wondrous title in its greatness and glory we must study John's gospel. We must see how Jesus expressed
{6}
God in His nature and in all His thoughts manward, and we need to read the whole gospel in the light of the opening verses.
The Word is, and was eternally, a divine Person. @John 1:1 - 3 is intended to make us take our shoes off, and prostrate our souls in worship, as we see His eternal place in Deity. Seeing this we should read the whole gospel in the spirit of adoration, connecting every word and act of our Lord with His eternal Person. It is essential that we should do so. The names and titles by which we know Him in Manhood -- the Word, Jesus Christ, the Son, and many others -- do not cover all that is true of His eternal Person. But the intelligent affections of the saints, as taught by the Spirit, never disconnect His present names or titles from His eternal Person. Every Name which He bears attaches to One who is eternally divine, and now that they are known we can identify them with Him even when referring to Him before He actually bore them. It is the manner of Scripture to do so.
For example, John tells us that "every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ come in flesh is of God; and every spirit which does not confess Jesus Christ come in flesh is not of God; and this is that power of the anti-christ, of which ye have heard that it comes, and now it is already in the world", @1 John 4:2,3. The whole point of this lies in the fact that a divine Person has come in flesh. He did not actually bear the name "Jesus Christ" until He was here in manhood. But after He had "come in flesh" the name which He bore as incarnate was used by John to designate Him as having "come"; that is, as One who had pre-existed as a divine Person. This shows in a very distinct way that His eternal Person is identified with His present names and titles.
Paul uses the name "Christ Jesus" in exactly the same
{7}
way. He speaks of Christ Jesus as "subsisting in the form of God" before He took His place in the likeness of men (@Philippians 2:5 - 7). This was a present known name of our Lord; it did not actually apply to Him as in Deity in the past eternity, though, of course, it was in divine purpose that He should take it up. But Paul used it when speaking of Him before incarnation; the One who is now known by that name is an eternal divine Person. It would be true to say, 'Jesus existed from eternity', but in so saying we should identify the name with the Person who bears it, though we well know that Jesus was His name as born into this world.
We have the Lord's own authority for identifying His eternal Person with a title which clearly only applies strictly to Him as Man. He said, "If then ye see the Son of man ascending up where he was before?" @John 6:62. And He spoke of the Son of man coming down out of heaven (@John 3:13). This is of the highest importance as instructing us in the precious truth that none of His present titles as Man are to be detached in our minds from what He was eternally before He became Man. The names and titles now attach to His Person, but His Person is eternal. Jesus spoke of Himself in @John 8:40 as "a man who has spoken the truth to you" -- I believe the only time that He spoke of Himself as "a man" -- but He said in the same chapter, "Before Abraham was, I am". That man was the eternal God, but any intelligent child would understand that He was not a Man before Abraham's time.
This leads us to recognise, too, that His names and titles as Man do not cover the whole truth of His Person. He is Himself greater than them all. The first three verses of John's gospel assure us of this. He is "the Word", and as "the Word" He is the intelligible expression of God to us. This is a title which corresponds with @Hebrews 1:1,2:
{8}
"God having spoken in many parts and in many ways formerly to the fathers in the prophets, at the end of these days has spoken to us in the person of the Son". It is soberly reverent to believe that whatever He has spoken to us He intends us to hear and understand. The speaking of God to us in the Son, who is also the Word, has to do with what He is pleased to express of Himself to men for their intelligent apprehension, and their infinite blessing and joy. When we perceive this we become concerned to understand what He has expressed and spoken to men.
"The Word" -- signifying what is intelligible -- does not cover all that attaches to the great and glorious Person who is known by that designation. @Hebrews 1 tells us how God has spoken to men "in Son", but it also says of that glorious One, "by whom also he made the worlds". This is inscrutable, for the act of creation is beyond the compass of the creature mind, though understood by faith. The next sentence also refers to what is inscrutable: "Who being the effulgence of his glory, and the expression of his substance" (Clearly 'substance', 'essential being', not 'person'. Note in the Darby Translation). This is beyond us, for the Being of God is beyond our finite capacity, though we can own adoringly that the Son is the expression of it. But what He is as "the Word" does come within our apprehension. Indeed the great object of John in writing is to show that it has done so. "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us ... full of grace and truth; ... for of his fulness we all have received, and grace upon grace", @John 1:14 - 16. The fulness of grace and truth in "the Word" is there to be received by men; the declaration of God by the only-begotten Son is not inscrutable; it makes God known to us most fully in grace and truth; the speaking of God in Son is not to be refused, but heard and understood. The Lord's precious title, "the Word", relates to
{9}
what is expressed in Him so as to be received and understood by us. There had been previous communications from God in prophets, but in the Son as Man here God Himself spoke to men in fulness of grace and truth.
The glory which belongs to Christ as "the Word" is infinitely great, and such as could only attach to a divine Person, but it is a glory which is apprehensible by the creature -- a fulness of grace and truth of which we all have received. But, while rejoicing in this, we remember with deep reverence that there is a greatness in Him which in inscrutable. John speaks of this inscrutable greatness when he tells us that "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. *He* was in the beginning with God". The expressions 'eternal Word', 'everlasting Word', have been used with pious intent to assert the eternal character of the Person, but they tend to obscure the difference between what He is as "the Word", expressing God to men in fulness of grace and truth, and what He was, and is, in the inscrutableness of eternal Deity. To distinguish between these two things takes nothing from the Lord. It is no derogation from His Person or glory. It gives full place to all that He is as "the Word", and enhances it by connecting it in our minds and hearts with His eternal Person. It is due to Him that both aspects of His glory should be before us, and intelligently distinguished. The Incarnation was necessary for the intelligible expression of God, and this is obscured if we think that Jesus was actually "the Word" in the past eternity. God would have our minds and hearts filled with what we know of Him as having come now into full expression. This important matter is that Jesus, God's beloved Son, should be to us "the Word".
It has been said that God suffices for Himself in everything but His love, but because of His love -- what He is
{10}
in His nature -- He must express Himself so that His intelligent creatures may know and love Him. So a divine Person came in Manhood, and John writes to tell us of Him, and of what He was before He became Man. He had distinct Personality, but was in the unity of the Godhead, was God, before there was any creation.
We read in @Genesis 1:1,"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth". It is of that beginning that John speaks when he tells us that "All things received being through him, and without him not one thing received being which has received being". The One who is the theme of John's gospel is the Creator-God of @Genesis 1, the eternal supreme Being. His Personality, as distinct from the other Persons in the Godhead, was not declared in @Genesis 1, but it is now made clearly known in @John 1. We bear it in mind all the time as we read the gospel of John. It gives a profound sense of the greatness of the Person in whom, as Man on earth, God has been expressed.
The Lord refers to another wondrous "beginning" when He says, "But I did not say these things unto you from the beginning, because I was with you. But now I go to him that has sent me", @John 16:4,5. God would have us to attach great importance to the point of time which the Lord here referred to as "the beginning". It clearly refers to the commencement of His public ministry. Peter speaks of "all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day in which he was taken up from us", @Acts 1:21,22. The first two chapters of Matthew and of Luke give us an account of what preceded His baptism and public service, but Luke tells us that he composed his discourse "concerning all things which Jesus began both to do and to teach". The Lord's public ministry was his theme; he spoke of matters "as those who from the beginning
{11}
were eye-witnesses of and attendants on the Word have delivered them to us", @Luke 1:2. This is important as giving us the point of time from which the Lord is regarded in Scripture as the Sent One. Indeed He Himself defined it when He read in the synagogue at Nazareth the precious words, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach glad tidings to the poor; he has sent me to preach to captives deliverance", @Luke 4:18.
"Anointed" and "sent" -- this is the order; and it is in keeping with the "sanctified and sent into the world" of @John 10:36. So the Lord speaks of Himself as having been "sent forth" to announce the glad tidings (@Luke 4:43).
His coming into the world in John is not exactly His birth, but what He was born for. He distinguishes the two things in @John 18:37, "1 have been born for this, and for this I have come into the world, that I might bear witness to the truth". As coming into the world He comes after John the baptist, and He lightens every man. His full mission and ministry are in view. So that as long as He was in the world He was the light of the world, and the Object of faith. There is a moral force in it, only to be known as taking account of what His position was after the Spirit descended and abode upon Him. "For judgment am I come into this world" clearly refers to His coming publicly as Light; it would hardly apply to the thirty years before He was manifested to Israel. "Because ye are with me from the beginning" (@John 15:27) makes evident that the great subject of witness *begins* with the descent of the Spirit upon Him. In the light of this we can see that His coming out from God and from the Father (@John 16:27,28) was when He was manifested as coming after John. It refers to His coming as the manifested Light of men rather than to His birth into this world. "I came forth from God and am come from him; for neither am I
{12}
come of myself, but he has sent me" (@John 8:42) indicates His moral origin, so that if God had been their Father they would have loved Him. It is, as J.N.D. said, 'a mission from the divine Person, not from a place at all'. As "in the world" He manifested the Father's name to the men given Him; He gave them the words which the Father gave Him, and they received them and knew truly that He came out from the Father; they believed that the Father had sent Him. "As thou hast sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the world" (@John 17:18) shows what a distinct mission is, in each case, in view; the statement does not refer only to the presence on earth of the Son of God or of His disciples, but to the fact that from a certain definite moment He was sent by the Father into the world, and, in like manner, from a definite point they were sent by Him. I believe the apprehension of this is essential to the spiritual understanding of how the Son of God is presented in the gospel of John.
In John's epistle he speaks of another "beginning". "That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes; that which we contemplated, and our hands handled, concerning the word of life; (and the life has been manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father, and has been manifested to us:)", @1 John 1:1,2. This "beginning" clearly refers to what was manifested to the apostles in Jesus Christ the Son of the Father. Not exactly His Person, but what was manifested in Him -- "the word of life", "the life", "the eternal life". For the first time in the history of the world there was a true and full expression of "life", and it was expressed in One who could be heard, seen and handled. This is another wonderful result of God's Son being here; "life" has come into view, or, as we read here, has been manifested. John
{13}
had spoken in the gospel of the declaration of God by the only-begotten Son; but now he speaks of the manifestation of "life" in Him; that is, life in man relative to God, and God known as the Father. "Life" has been manifested in the same Person who has so blessedly declared God; it has come into the view of men and it has been reported to us. It came into expression in what the Son said and did as found in the condition of flesh in which He was heard and seen here.
Death and darkness were in the world but "in him was life", and it was there in the way of illumination for men -- "the light of life", as He said in @John 8:12. It is wondrous to consider that "life" in the true and full sense has shone as light for men in Christ the Son. The darkness did not apprehend it, but it was shining for every man and it was manifested to those whose eyes were divinely opened to see it. "Life" in which sin was not and in which there was nothing for the ruler of the world, nothing that gave death any claim upon Him, nothing that the fallen man could take pleasure in, but everything that answered in full perfection to the will and pleasure of God. The "life" was in broad and full contrast with the death that was here. Men would not have known what "life" really was if God had not been pleased that it should be manifested in His Son. We are accustomed to a death scene, and we are naturally part of it, but "life" has been manifested here in Him who was "the Son of the Father". We have not personally seen it, but the apostles did, and they have reported it to us that we might have fellowship with them.
But there was also a specific character of life which had been spoken of in Scripture as "the blessing, life for evermore", @Psalm 133:3. The Old Testament had spoken of it as being in God's mind for men, and the Jews clearly had it before them as something to be greatly desired; it was
{14}
to them the life of blessing which could be inherited by God's favour in the world to come. The Lord spoke much of "life eternal" in the gospel of John as the blessing into which men would enter by believing on Him. It is a blessing "which God, who cannot lie, promised before the ages of time", @Titus 1:2. Now John reports "the eternal life" to us as being "with the Father", and as having been manifested to the apostles. The promised blessing for men has taken form in the Son of God, and it has been known in Him as being "with the Father". Eternal life is thus seen to stand in relation to God known as the Father; that is, God as fully made known in grace by the Son. And "the eternal life" has been manifested to men, and became their delight and the subject of their witness.
There was that in the Son of God of which men, chosen of Him for that high favour, could take knowledge as being "with the Father". The Father had with Him, in the Person of His beloved Son as Man upon earth, what He had before Him, and promised as blessing for man, before the ages of time. And it was manifested to the apostles, not to the world. It was not exactly the public life of the Lord such as natural men could take account of, but that which was "with the Father", and which to His chosen ones was in manifestation in His words and ways. All that He said and did was the expression to those who had ears to hear and eyes to see of an inward life which was "with the Father". Not here His relationship as Son with the Father -- though He was at the same time the Son of the Father -- but the blessed fact that "the eternal life" was "with the Father" in Him. This was a profound delight to John; he and other apostles perceived in Jesus a life which was "with the Father", but in which men could participate by believing on Him. It filled John with joy and he would have us to share that joy.
{15}
In being able to apprehend the eternal life as manifested in the Son of God the apostles had fellowship with the Father and the Son. The Father had with Him, in the Person of the Son, as Man, all that was covered by the words, "the eternal life". And the Son had the joy of being "with the Father" as setting forth in Himself this great blessing for men. Eternal life was one of the great thoughts of God in regard to men. But it has now been brought into actual being and into manifestation in the Person of the Son of God so as to be the subject of witness, and it has been reported to us. In apprehending it the apostles had fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ, and they have reported what they saw and heard that we may have fellowship with them and have our joy full.
The Father's Son in Manhood manifested "the eternal life" to His loved disciples. The eternal life period began in Him, but it came in that men might participate in it by believing on Him. It was there in Him, as a living Source and Fountain of life for men. What a wondrous "beginning"! The eternal life period has begun, and John writes that we may know it and have the joy of it as those who have life in the Son of God. The Son of God as a glorified Man is "the true God and eternal life", @1 John 5:20.
In conclusion we may consider briefly that John refers in various places to another "beginning", (see @1 John 2:7, 24; @1 John 3:11; @2 John 6). These scriptures show that there has been a "beginning" on our side. That is, we, as christians and believers, have had a wonderful beginning. We have all begun, according to God, by hearing the divine testimony which has been brought to us by the apostles. No other beginning than this would be of any account in God's reckoning. This was the "beginning" of the knowledge of divine Persons on the part of men, consequent upon the
{16}
glorification of Jesus, the coming of the Holy Spirit, and the reception of the apostles¬ testimony. The "beginning" of christianity was the coming to man of the blessed truth concerning the Son and the Father. It is clear from John's writing that the "little children" in the family of God began with the knowledge of the Son and the Father, and had the Unction from the Holy One. These are most wonderful divine realities. Now we are to let these things abide in us. They are what we began with, and we are not to be led astray from them. If that which we heard from the beginning abides in us, we shall abide in the Son and in the Father, and we shall find that this is life eternal. Life eternal is bound up with what we heard from the beginning, so that it is of the utmost importance for us to know what we did hear from the beginning. That is, what have we really heard from the apostles, or learned from their inspired writings? God would have us to regard this as what we heard from the beginning, and not what men have said since, even with the most pious intentions. If we are preserved through grace from that which leads astray we shall know the blessedness of life eternal. If our joy is not full it is because we have not allowed what we heard from the beginning to abide in us.
Paul presents eternal life as an end to be reached by moving on certain lines, but John's ministry gives us to know that this is the eternal life period, and that eternal life is bound up with the abiding in us of what we heard from the beginning. The "promise" becomes a present reality to those who, by the teaching of the Unction, abide in the Son and in the Father. Before eternal life is brought in publicly believers on the Son of God have it in Him; the Unction which we have received teaches us to abide in Him.

NOTES OF A READING
@John 1: 1 - 5
C.A.C. The writings of John have a very peculiar place and value particularly as having been written, as we might say, late in the day. I suppose every form of evil that has come into the assemblies was present and had manifested itself before John wrote any of his writings. I have no doubt that if John's writings got their place in our affections they would make us overcomers. We should come out in the full bloom of life, notwithstanding all that has happened and that exists. There is a certain completeness about things in John that we do not get anywhere else. For instance, we do not get in John any parable of the sower with varying results; we do not get any net let down and breaking, or any such parables as that of the talents in Matthew and the pounds in Luke where there are varying results. John has in view a complete result; he has in view the holy city coming down from God out of heaven, all its features divine and spiritual and coming up to full measurement. There is a complete result for the glory of God; that is the line of John.
We are not on the line of responsibility in John's gospel; we are on the line of divine sovereignty and of what God does. It is a question of the work of God, and John would help us to look at it in its essential character, in its perfection. The more we are occupied with what is of God and perfect, the stronger we shall be to overcome what is of the flesh and of the world.
The responsible side is in the background in John's gospel, and things are brought before us in which there is no defect. A Person is introduced in whom it is impossible
{18}
there should be any defect, and what that Person says, and what He does, and what He gives are all like Himself; all is divinely complete and perfect. Therefore it is of the greatest importance for us to start with a right thought of the greatness of the Person, and this is presented to us in the opening verses of the gospel.
The great thing before the mind of the Spirit in this book is that we should understand the mediatorial glory of the Son of God, and therefore the gospel opens with a statement that introduces Him in His mediatorial glory -- that is, "the Word". "The Word" is a mediatorial title. It is a most precious title of the Lord because it sets Him forth as the One who has expressed God to us. And those for whom this gospel is written are persons who have apprehended Him in that character.
Ques. Could we say He expressed God "in the beginning"?
C.A.C. No, but the Person whom we know as having expressed God to us was "in the beginning". This gives us the ineffable divine greatness of the One who has expressed God to us. If He had not been so great as He is He could not have expressed God to us. If He had not been Himself God He would not have been equal to expressing God to us. His mediatorial glory as "the Word" is dependent on His personal glory: it is dependent on the truth of His Person. As to His Person He was from eternity and He was God. He had no mediatorial place in eternity. I suppose we can all see that in the past eternity before there was any creation, He was not expressing God to creatures capable of hearing what He had to say. His mediatorial glory as "the Word" is connected with the way that God has made Himself known to men. God has spoken in Son -- that is mediatorial. God could not put Himself into communication with men apart from a Mediator. God is infinitely great, and man as a creature is small; it is
{19}
impossible that God could put Himself in communication with men, His creatures, without a Mediator. Scripture is full of that wonderful idea.
Ques. What is "the beginning"?
C.A.C. It is an expression which carries us as far back as our finite minds are able to travel. There are different beginnings in Scripture: John speaks in his epistle of "Him that is from the beginning" -- that clearly refers to the beginning of Christianity in the incarnation of the Son of God and its blessed results. Then John speaks of the devil sinning from the beginning; that is the beginning of sin. Then in @Genesis 1 we read, "In the beginning God created" -- that is the beginning of creation. But in @John 1 it says, "In the beginning was the Word" -- that carries us right back before these other beginnings; it carries us back to God's eternity; our minds are not able to compass that, but it is made known to us that from the most remote point which we can conceive in relation to the eternal God, the Word was. When we think of Deity in eternity we cannot explain it. Our attitude of mind and heart relative to it is reverence and adoration. It is only what has come into the mediatorial sphere that is accessible to us; it would help us greatly to see that. There are certain things which are inaccessible to us, and we must accept that, "No man has seen God at any time"; as such He is inaccessible. He dwells in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see, but everything that God has brought into the mediatorial sphere is accessible, that we may apprehend it and live in it. In the sphere of absolute Deity everything is inaccessible to men as creatures.
Ques. Is "that they may behold my glory" (@John 17:24) in the mediatorial sphere?
C.A.C. It is a given glory which will come within the range of the apprehensions of the glorified saints. It is not within the range of our apprehensions now but it will be in
{20}
the glorified state when we shall be with Him and like Him. We shall then behold the glory that the Father has given Him, for He loved Him before the foundation of the world. Who can tell what it is? I do not think anyone can, but we are going to see it in our glorified state. It is a given glory and it is given to the Son of God as One loved before the foundation of the world but now known as having come into the mediatorial position.
Rem. Jacob said he saw God face to face (@Genesis 32:30). C.A.C. Yes; he got a sense, as others did, that he had seen God. There were certain occasions in Old Testament times when God manifested Himself in angelic form or in the form of a man. It was "a man" that wrestled with Jacob; one could not think of God as such, wrestling with a man; the man would be consumed in a moment. A man wrestled with Jacob, but Jacob realised that God was there, though He was hidden, if we may so say, behind the form of "a man". It says in Exodus, "They saw the God of Israel", @Exodus 24:10. God was pleased to manifest Himself in certain forms in Old Testament times, generally in angelic form. The law and all that was known of God in connection with the law and the appearance of the glory of God then was, we are told, "by the ministry of angels", @Acts 7:53. It was angelic glory. All the appearances of God in the Old Testament were a foreshadowing of the incarnation; we must not think of them as being any full outshining of the invisible God. The words of this chapter make it clear that "No one has seen God at any time" (verse 18). Indeed, I do not know that even in the New Testament *God* is ever said to be "revealed". The Father is revealed by the Son (@Matthew 11:27) but *God* is said to be "declared", and this is in keeping with @Hebrews 1 where we are told that God has spoken in the Son. The Mediator has come out and declared the God that no man has seen nor can see
{21}
Ques. Why is there a change in verse 18, "No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared him"?
C.A.C. That is to bring out the wonderful place the Mediator has in the affections of the Father, so He is competent to declare God. None of us knows God at all, morally or in His nature, save as His beloved Son has declared Him. There is no other knowledge of God but as He is declared mediatorially.
Ques. Is there anything more to make known? The Lord said in @John 17, "I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known".
C.A.C. Those last words refer to what the Lord would make known in resurrection. He had made the Father's name known in His life before the cross but He had never then said, "My Father and your Father ... . my God and your God". There is no more to be made known. What we have to do is to seek to enter into what has come out.
Ques. What is the force of declaring?
C.A.C. All that God is morally and in His nature is made known. Creation never made that known; it did make certain invisible things known, which are apprehend ed by the mind through the things that are made (@Romans 1). These things are God's eternal power and divinity; these are invisible things, but they are apprehended by the mind of man through the things that are made. Man cannot get farther than that through creation. I see God's eternal power and divinity in the star-spangled sky and all the beauty and order of nature, but that gives me no conception of what God is morally or of what He is in His nature. I cannot learn that from the things that are made, I have to learn it through the Mediator.
Ques. What is the thought of "in him was life"? C.A.C. In verse 4 we come to man's sphere. In the first three verses we are in the sphere of Deity, in which
{22}
man does not appear; verse 4 brings men into view. "In him was life, and the life was the light of men". So verse 4 is the mediatorial aspect of things; something becomes available as light for man.
Ques. Why do you say there is no revelation of God?
C.A.C. The Father has been revealed by the Son, for He could say, "He that has seen me has seen the Father;", @John 14:9. God is known to us as the Father, not simply as the Creator or Elohim, or as the most High, or as Jehovah, but as the Father. But *God* is "declared"; He is told out; it is not a question of what we can see but of what we hear. Revelation properly is what we may see; the Father was seen in the Son. But the way we know *God* is through declaration; He has been declared. Everything depends on what can be heard; it is heard from the Son. This is peculiar to Christianity: it is obvious that we cannot carry the name 'Father' back into the Old Testament; no one knew Him as Father in the Old Testament; He was known by other titles. Of course there could not be any change in God, but it is a question of how God is pleased to be known by men. He was pleased to be known by the patriarchs as the Almighty and Most High, and to Israel as Jehovah; we cannot carry the name 'Father' back into the Old Testament; it does not belong to that period. No people of God could go beyond what was made known to them. The Psalms do not go beyond the name of Jehovah; there is no address to God as the Father in the Psalms and there is no trace in all the 150 Psalms of conscious sonship. If people now live in the Psalms they live below their privileges, though of course we can profit by all that they contain.
Rem. Paul said, "Whom therefore ye reverence, not knowing him, him I announce to you", @Acts 17:23. C.A.C. Yes, Paul was a chosen vessel taken up so that God, who was unknown by the heathen, might be
{23}
announced to them by one who knew Him through the Mediator. Paul knew Him through the Mediator so he was qualified to announce Him to those to whom He was the unknown God.
The present period is distinctly contrasted in this chapter with what went before. "For the law was given by Moses: grace and truth subsists through Jesus Christ". The declaration of God has made a complete change in the whole position of things: they are not at all what they were before the incarnation. Scripture speaks of the incarnation as an entirely new beginning; it must be so if a divine Person has become Man. Such a stupendous intervention of God could not do otherwise than change everything. It changes everything for God and for man, and I do not think we have any right conception of the greatness of the incarnation; it is stupendous!
It would help us greatly to see more fully the import of this wonderful designation of our Lord, "the Word". That is how He is known to those who believe on Him; He is known as "the Word". There is no statement in Scripture that He was "the Word" in eternity, but the One whom we know now as "the Word", the One who has become "the Word" to us, was "in the beginning". That Person was from eternity, and in eternity He "was God".
Ques. What does that verse mean, "I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord God, he who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty", @Revelation 1: 8?
C.A.C. God is "the Alpha and the Omega ... the Lord God, he who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty". These are Old Testament titles. But the Alpha and the Omega is that God presents Himself as the great starting point of everything and the great end of everything. He is the A and Z, the first letter of the alphabet and the last. Everything begins with God and everything will end with Him. It is what belongs to God
{24}
as such; but then the Lord Jesus is God, so He has part in it all.
Ques. Does this explain the title, "Father of eternity", @Isaiah 9:6?
C.A.C. Yes, I think so. That is the name of the Child born and the Son given, "His name is called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace". All that is proper to God belongs to Christ because He was God and He is God. He is co-equal personally with the other Persons in Deity. All the titles by which God is known in the Old Testament belong to Christ -- Almighty, Elohim, Jehovah. All these titles belong to Christ because He is God; that is the greatness of His Person.
Ques. Why is verse 2 brought in in addition to verse 1? C.A.C. It is brought in to make clear the distinct personality of "the Word" from eternity. It is not that He came into existence at some point far back -- there have been some who held that -- but "He was in the beginning with God" -- a distinct personality from eternity, co-equal and co-eternal with God. The common ideas current in christendom do not take account of that. The commonly held thought in christendom is that there was a point in eternity when He was begotten, when He derived His being from the Father. But the term "begotten" is only applied in Scripture to the Lord as begotten in time. @Psalm 2, verse 7, says, "I will declare the decree: Jehovah hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; I this day have begotten thee". That scripture is quoted several times in the New Testament. It is as born in time that the Lord was "begotten", not before all worlds. From eternity He was God, but He became incarnate through the power of the Highest overshadowing the virgin so that she conceived in the womb and bore a Son. He was "begotten" on a particular day as born in time.
It is altogether wrong to apply the term "begotten"
{25}
to our Lord in eternity. In eternity He was God, and there could be no thought of origin or generation in connection with an eternal divine Person. But the thought of generation did have place in connection with Him as born in time; He was conceived in the womb of the virgin by the Holy Spirit, and as "that holy thing" born He was called the Son of God. He came into manhood in that way. The word "begotten" applies to Him as born into the world, and not as in eternal Deity.
Ques. Is the "word of life" in @1 John 1:1 different from "the Word" in this gospel?
C.A.C. "The word of life" is that He has become the expression of life to us. In the gospel there is the expression of God to us, and that becomes life in our souls. But then our Lord is not only the expression of God to us but He is the expression of life to us. If we want to know what life is, what eternal life is, we may find the expression of it in Him.

NOTES OF A READING
@John 1:1 - 12
C.A.C. It is of the utmost importance that we should know the greatness of the One who has expressed God to us. None of the prophets could have been spoken of as "the Word"; they were channels of communication by which God made known certain things according to His pleasure, and none of them expressed God. In knowing the Lord Jesus Christ as "the Word" we regard Him as the One in whom God has been perfectly expressed. All that God is morally and in His nature has been expressed and express ed to men. If we think of that rightly we must be conscious that no one was competent to do it but One who was Himself God.
In the first three verses we see divine Persons in Their own sphere. We learn the eternal Deity of the Lord Jesus, and His distinct Personality in the Godhead, and we see Him as the universal Creator: everything received being through Him. These are great realities which are intended to be the subject of reverent contemplation and adoration. The Spirit of God would, in the first place, engage us with the greatness of the Person in whom God has been expressed; that gives infinite value to all that He said and to all He did and, we might add, to all that He gives; His greatness covers all with divine glory.
In verse 4 men come into view. "In him was life and the life was the light of men". As light He is the object for faith (verse 7). All the light of God has come into a scene of utter darkness and death, for verse 4 is evidently relative to death and darkness.
"All things received being through him". As Creator
{27}
He acted "in the form of God"; we are told He subsisted "in the form of God" (@Philippians 2:6), and as in that form He was the universal Creator. But now in the same Person as Man God has introduced life, and has introduced it as light for men.
It is rather remarkable that the condition in which the Lord came is not mentioned until verse 14. I think the Spirit of God would, in the first place, call our attention to what was there morally, and to the greatness of the Person Himself before He dwelt upon the condition into which the Person came. It is most important for us to get a right thought about the greatness of the Person, otherwise the condition into which He came might belittle Him, for He became flesh; He was here in man's lowly guise and dwelt among men. We need to have a most exalted thought of the Person before we think of the condition into which He came, "The Word became flesh". But the Spirit dwells first on what was there morally in Him before He speaks precisely of the condition in which it was expressed. A divine Person came into a new condition, as becoming Man, but His Person remained unchanged and unchangeable.
The life would not have become the light of men if He had not become a Man, but it is striking that John does not begin by saying He became flesh. It is helpful to see how the Spirit enlarges upon the glory of the Person before He speaks of the condition into which that Person came. We see all through this gospel the essential glory of the Person brought into view; we get it in such a word as "Before Abraham was, I AM". There His essential Personality comes out, what He ever was, however lowly the condition into which He came. This gospel was written to give us great thoughts of the Lord viewed mediatorially, but in order to do that we must have great thoughts of Him personally. What He was personally gave character, fulness and blessedness to everything He became
{28}
mediatorially. I believe the present exercises which the Spirit of God is promoting among the saints are to that end. The Spirit is ever faithful to His mission; the Lord said of Him, "He shall glorify me". The Spirit could never detract from Him, or give Him any place that is less than His proper place.
Ques. Why are we so ignorant of all this?
C.A.C. I suppose on account of the presence of darkness. Every one of us began in absolute darkness, without a single ray of light in our souls as to God. But now, while the Son of God has become light to us, that does not mean that all the darkness has gone on our side. John says in his epistle "the darkness is passing" -- not passed but passing -- "and the true light already shines". It is very much like a dissolving view, one picture going and another coming. The light is coming in and the darkness going; every ray of the light which comes in means more of the darkness going out. All our imperfections as to knowledge and as to apprehension and as to adoration arise from the presence still in our souls of elements of darkness. The great value of this gospel is that it brings before us absolute light in the Person of the Son of God, and in contemplating Him we get outside every shade of darkness. He could say, "I am come into the world as light" (chapter 12:46), and "As long as I am in the world I am the light of the world" (chapter 9:5). There was in Him the absolute shining of divine light without a single obscuring element. The only place that the greatest servant can have is to bear witness concerning the light. According to the measure in which we have apprehended the light we can bear witness to it. Darkness is ignorance of God; God unknown by an intelligent creature is terrible darkness. Men's minds have become enshrouded in more than Egyptian darkness that shuts out from them the true knowledge of God. Now God has brought in light so that all darkness might be
{29}
dispelled from our hearts and that we might live in the light of what God is. The natural man is so completely dark that he cannot apprehend the light. "The light appears in darkness, and the darkness apprehended it not". The darkness spoken of here is so positive in its character that if the brightest light is brought in it makes no difference. There is nothing like that in nature; however dark a place is, if a light is brought in the darkness goes; but this moral darkness is so intense that not even the brightest light affects it one bit, so there must be a work of God in man if he is to appreciate the light.
Ques. Would you explain "In him was life"?
C.A.C. Life was there in that Person and it was in Him as light for men. It is helpful as giving the clue to the way John speaks of life; he first speaks of it objectively. It is life in a sense in which it can be light for men; it can shine on men.
The opening chapters of Genesis help us as to the great primary thoughts of God. We can see there that God's thought was to have a world characterised by the presence of light and instinct with life. In the first two chapters living and life are mentioned seven times, indicating that God, being Himself a living God, must have a living universe. "Living souls" are mentioned six times in the first two chapters of Genesis. And then when God created Adam and Eve He said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth". That introduced the family idea as being capable of vast expansion. God's primary thoughts are His greatest thoughts; He is not like man. Man begins with immature thoughts which gradually develop, but God begins with the greatest and most complete thoughts. @Genesis 1 gives the thought of a scene where there is light, and which is full of the evidence of life. And then in relation to man the first thought God gives expression to is a family thought; He enjoins on
{30}
Adam and Eve to be fruitful and multiply. They were to fill the earth with a human family. These thoughts come out very distinctly in John's gospel -- light, life and a family of children for God.
It has pleased God from eternity to think of men; and Scripture shows us that though God has mighty hosts of intelligent beings in heavenly regions, beings of exalted character, and who have never fallen, yet no creatures that God ever brought into being have the place with Him that men have. Wisdom's delights were with the sons of men. God has never given us a thought that His delights were with angels. Think of the greatness of God, and that He should bind up the delights of His heart with creatures like you and me! Does it not bow the soul in adoration? We are filled with reverential appreciation of the blessedness of God in His nature!
God would bring in life for men in the glorious Person spoken of in @John 1:1 - 3, and it is in the knowledge of God made known in love that we have life. If we entered into the thought that God in love had found delight in us, and has eternally planned that we should find most wonderful blessing in the knowledge of Himself as love, that would be life in our souls. "The life was the light of men"; it gives one a living thought of light. J.N.D. expressed in one of his hymns: 'And who that glorious blaze of living light can tell?' (`79:7). It is the light of God Himself known as love; everything that He could express of Himself was expressed in His beloved Son and it was expressed in a living way. "In him was life", and it was expressed so as to become light for men. Life is light, as J.N.D.¬s note to his Translation says, as equivalent, one equal to the other; you could turn it round and say the light was life.
Ques. How is life objective?
C.A.C. Life consists in certain conditions that can be enjoyed; if you could take away from me all happy
{31}
conditions there would not be much left that could be spoken of as "life". I might still exist, but that is not life. Our human life consists in surroundings and associations and the system of affections in which we move; our life is in these things. Now life is brought in here in that way; it is brought in as being the expression to us of what God is in His nature and His character so that it may be life to us; not merely light but that we may live in it. "He that hath the Son hath life". The great controversy about eternal life in 1890 turned on that. Some wanted to think they had eternal life in themselves, and they were not pleased to have their attention called to the fact that eternal life was in a blessed divine Person, the Son of God. It was to be known and enjoyed there.
Ques. Does the thought of God and men come into view here before the thought of relationship?
C.A.C. Yes, and it leads to relationship, the family thought, as in verse 13. But, before the family thought is introduced we have the basis of it in the knowledge of God in love. If we do not know God in love, we shall not touch the family thought. Knowing God in love is the start, and the light of the love of God has come to us in His Son. As receiving Him by believing on His name we have right to take the place of children of God; thus the family thought is brought to pass.
What is brought to us in the Son of God is eternal in its character; it is unassailable by the power of evil or death. "In him was life" suggests that something is brought in which the power of death cannot touch. God has introduced a new Head and in that new Head is life. We do not connect the thought of life with ourselves or our experience, but with a living Person in whom it is.
Rem. "That we might live through him", @1 John 4:9. C.A.C. Yes, that is it exactly. The wonderful consideration of God comes out in the fact that the light
{32}
becomes the subject of witness -- verses 6, 7 and 8 refer to that. It brings out the consideration of God for men. Why should God give witness to the light? It is in pure consideration for men. He would not send the light into the world without heralding it; He would not let it break, as it were, unexpectedly on man. He would make it a subject of witness. So "There was a man sent from God, his name John. He came for witness, that he might witness concerning the light, that all might believe through him". Think of the consideration of it! God specially sending a man to bear witness of the light. The light was to be the object of faith and God in His consideration was pleased to call attention to it by witness being borne to it, even a human witness, specially sent for that purpose. Chapter 5 in this gospel brings out very fully the thought of the Son of God being the subject of witness. John, the Father, the works and the Scriptures are all brought in as witness. The thought of witness is very affecting because it shows how the blessed God would consider for us in our condition, and would actually take pains to draw our attention to the light in a definite systematic way. John came to be witness in a peculiar way; it was not given to any other prophet to bear witness to Christ here on earth; it was reserved for John to point Him out; he was allowed that wonderful place of honour. People who received John's testimony could say afterwards that all that John spoke of Him was true. What a blessed testimony! There was a unique character about John's testimony; it was different from anything that had gone before; it stood in immediate relation to Christ the Son of God as actually present on earth.
Rem. The thought of sending is very prominent in this gospel.
C.A.C. Yes, sent is a very characteristic word of this gospel; I think it occurs about forty times. It is a mediatorial word; wherever you find the word "sent" you may
{33}
conclude at once that it is in a mediatorial connection. The relations that subsist between the Sender and the sent One are not relations of absolute equality; they imply authority on the part of the Sender and subjection and obedience on the part of the sent One; so the word "sent" is mediatorial. You could not connect the word "sent" with the essential and eternal glory of the Son of God; it belongs to His mediatorial glory. The Lord's own words make it clear; He says in this gospel, "the bondman is not greater than his lord, nor the sent greater than he who has sent him", @John 13:16. There is a similar relationship between the sender and the sent as there is between the lord and the bondman. There is subordination to the will of another in the idea of the word "sent". Now the Lord as in that place is in the mediatorial place; it is not the place of His proper personal and eternal glory, but the place of His mediatorship as the sent One. I take that to be of vital importance to apprehend. "Whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world"; such statements bring out the mediatorial glory of the Lord in a wonderful way. They bring out the place into which He has come, not to do His own will, but to declare God -- the place of service and obedience. Whenever you read the word "sent", think of the Lord's words in chapter 13 that the sent One is not greater than He who sent Him. As the sent One He could say, "My Father is greater than I", @John 14:28. He would not say that in regard to His eternal personality; He was co-equal in glory and majesty with the other Persons in the Godhead. This lies at the root of a great deal that is in controversy at the present time. We need to be exercised to understand the difference between His Personal glory which never changes, and never can change; "who is over all, God blessed for ever" (@Romans 9:5), and His mediatorial glory as the sent One; the subject One who came to do the will of the One who sent Him.
{34}
Rem. Before He was sent was there a movement on His part as a divine Person?
C.A.C. Yes; we find that in @Philippians 2: 5 - 7. "Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus; who, subsisting in the form of God, did not esteem it an object of rapine to be on an equality with God; but emptied himself, taking a bondman's form, taking his place in the likeness of men". That is what He did Himself; taking a bondman's form was His own act as a divine Person. But having taken that form He ever acted according to the truth of the place He had taken. He never acted from His own will, He was the obedient One. His coming down from heaven was His own act, but He came down to be here in the subject place, not to do His own will but the will of the One who sent Him. The two things are ever distinguished, though in John's gospel His personal glory and His mediatorial glory are interwoven and blended; so that we find them, as it were, side by side, yet they are perfectly distinguishable. When He says, "I am come down" (@John 6:38), that is His own sovereign act; but what did He come down for? "Not that I should do *my* will but the will of him that has sent me" -- that is the servant position. You see how closely the two run together, but they are clearly distinguishable.
By His own act He emptied Himself and took a bondman's form. We think of Him now as the glorious and glorified Man. There was no more humiliation after He had completed the work which was given Him to do. He was raised triumphant by the glory of the Father, and after displaying the power of resurrection during forty days, He ascended and was, as Paul tells us, "received up in glory", @1 Timothy 3:16. There He is at God's right hand, glorified at the right hand of the greatness on high; His humiliation is for ever past. He will be the subject One eternally. It will be His eternal glory to be placed in
{35}
subjection. Our Lord having taken up mediatorial glory will never divest Himself of it. He will wear it through God's eternity. But every creature who knows Him in that subject place will worship Him as God over all, blessed for ever! His personal glory and His mediatorial glory will blend throughout eternal ages. What a Person to know and love and serve! May the Lord help us to see more of His glory!

THE ACTIVITY AND PURPOSE OF GRACE
@John 1:1 - 51
I have no thought of attempting to unfold all that is contained in this chapter, but I should like to bring before you some of the great truths which are here presented to us. The first thing I wish to speak of is the condition of the world and the way in which it has been exposed. In the opening verses of this chapter the condition of the world is completely disclosed in a few simple words. Everything has been brought to light. We do not need to try experiments to find out what the world is. Nothing can be added to the exposure of @John 1:1 - 11.
Men can never by wisdom or philosophy get to the bottom of things because they leave God out. We must bring God in to get the true light -- to get a right estimate of anything. And here we see that all the light of God has come into the world. The true light has come. The mind and nature of God have been most perfectly expressed in the Word made flesh, and in the light of this revelation the world has been exposed. "The light appears in darkness, and the darkness apprehended it not". "He was in the world, and the world had its being through him, and the world knew him not. He came to his own, and his own received him not". The light shone for every man, but it shone upon stone-blind eyes. There was every testimony to the conscience of man. For privileged Israel there was the witness of John; the appointed herald went before Jehovah, and everybody in Israel whose conscience was not hardened recognised him as sent of God. But all was in vain. There is no capacity in man to take in divine light.
{37}
People say they want more light, but the truth is that all the light has come and been refused. The world is a scene of moral darkness in which there is no response to God. If you accept this you will be assured that the grace of God is man's only hope.
It is certain that the Son of God would never have come into the world merely to expose the darkness that was in it. He has done that by the way; but the great thought of God was to declare Himself (verse 18) and to have a company capable of appreciating that declaration. The world does not appreciate God, it will not receive a ray of light from Him. But He means to have a company with capacity to appreciate Him. This is the great design of grace. How could we be supremely happy in God's presence if we did not know and appreciate Him?
"As many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God, to those that believe on his name; who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor of man's will, but of God". There is no capacity in the natural man to receive light from God. There must be a company born "of God" to receive light from Him. To Nicodemus it was said, "Except any one be born anew he cannot see the kingdom of God", @John 3:3. It is "not of blood", that is by natural descent; nor is it of "flesh's will, nor of man's will" in any way. It is of God in the activity and sovereignty of His grace. There is nothing in man that would originate any movement towards God, but He has purposed to have a company for Himself, and He will accomplish His purpose in spite of all the opposition and darkness that is in man. Every converted person knows that unless the grace of God had wrought in him he would never have received Christ. Nay, we did our utmost to resist the grace which sought our blessing. But God wrought in us, our self-sufficiency broke down, and a great void was produced in our hearts -- a thirst for the
{38}
knowledge of God -- and thus we were prepared to receive the light.
"As many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God, to those that believe on his name". It is thus that the work of God in souls is brought to light. As Christ is preached, and the light of God shines forth, there is a response in hearts where God has wrought. Thus the light of grace, presented in the gospel, makes manifest those in whom there is a work of the Spirit of God. And those who receive the light -- who receive Christ by believing on His name -- have the right to take the place of children of God. That is, they are entitled to take the place of having a kindred nature with God. They appreciate His light and believe on the name of Him in whom it has all come.
Now I should like to say a few words about the privileges of the children as they are brought before us in the next few verses of the chapter. In looking at them we must remember that we are not in the marvellous position occupied by the apostles. We enter into these things through their writings. The apostles could say, "Our fellowship is indeed with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ"; and as to our part in it, John says, "That which we have seen and heard we report to you, that ye also may have fellowship with us", @1 John 1:3.
"The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us". The Son of the Father could not be at home in this world but there was a little company among whom He could tabernacle. His heart could have no links with the darkness of the world, but amongst those born "of God" He could make Himself known and speak of what was in His heart. He could say to the Father, "I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest me out of the world. They were thine, and thou gavest them me, and they have kept thy word. Now they have known that all things that thou
{39}
hast given me are of thee; for the words which thou hast given me I have given them, and they have received them, and have known truly that I came out from thee, and have believed that thou sentest me", @John 17: 6 - 8. Is it not a priceless privilege to be of the company to whom the Son can thus make Himself and the Father known?
"We have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father". What a new world for their hearts! What a contrast to all the scene of oppression, self-seeking and religious corruption around! Many have enough light to make them dissatisfied with things here but do not appear to have tasted the immeasurable satisfaction of contemplating the glory of the Word become flesh. The world cannot satisfy. If you had all the opportunities of Solomon you would find in the end that the world was too little for your heart. But there is an Object in whom the heart may find its absorbing and abiding satisfaction. "We have contemplated his glory".
"Full of grace and truth". In the Word become flesh our hearts find the perfect revelation of all that the Father is in the activity of His matchless grace and of all that He is in the blessedness of His own being and nature. And all subsists through Jesus Christ. There is no more to come, or to be known; it is all out. "The only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared him".
"Of his fulness we all have received, and grace upon grace". We may have taken in very little of it, but it is "of his fulness" that we have received, and every taste of it awakens the desire for more. It is not only "grace" to begin with when the heart makes its first acquaintance with that glorious Person, but it is "grace upon grace" in deepening knowledge of Him.
<blockquote>'Yet sure, if in Thy presence <br>My soul still constant were, <br>Mine eye would, more familiar', </blockquote>
{40}
<blockquote>'Its brighter glories bear, <br>And thus Thy deep perfections <br>Much better should I know, <br>And with adoring fervour <br>In this Thy nature grow'. (`51:4)</blockquote>
Then as we pass on through the chapter we learn how the gracious purposes and the glory of God have an eternal basis in righteousness, and have been secured by redemption. "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world" (verse 29). Here was a Person capable of taking up the whole question of sin, and of bearing its judgment so as to glorify God fully. The purposes of God rest upon this secure foundation, and in virtue of an accomplished redemption not only can they all be carried out but the Holy Spirit can be given to bring the light and joy of those purposes into the hearts of the children of God. "He who sent me to baptise with water, *he* said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit". It is only in the power and unction of the Holy Spirit that we can enter into the wondrous thoughts and purposes of God. Baptism by water introduces us into a new position on earth, but the baptism of the Holy Spirit introduced the believer to a circle of things connected with heaven, and gives him capacity to enter into heavenly things. The Spirit carries our affections into the region of eternal life. He is "a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life", @John 4:14. He brings us into the circle of heavenly things and is the present power by which we can appropriate and enjoy our privileges.
But if this be so, it is of immense importance that our hearts should be under the sway of the Spirit, and we are sure to be tested as to this. Christ is everything to hearts that are under the sway of the Spirit, and a lovely picture of this is presented to our view in the chapter before us.
{41}
"Again, on the morrow, there stood John and two of his disciples. And, looking at Jesus as he walked, he says, Behold the Lamb of God. And the two disciples heard him speaking and followed Jesus. But Jesus, having turned, and seeing them following, says to them, What seek ye? And *they* said to him, Rabbi (which, being interpreted, signifies Teacher), where abidest thou? He says to them, Come and see. They went therefore, and saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day. It was about the tenth hour".
John's involuntary exclamation arrested the hearts of his two disciples and brought them under the divine attraction of a new Object. They followed Jesus. He had become their absorbing Object and His company their supreme desire.
A third was soon added to their number and the three together present a beautiful pattern of the christian company, John (for I do not doubt he was one of the three, though unnamed) representing the affection of the company, Andrew its testimony and service and Peter expressive of the fact that it is a structure of living stones, an imperishable edifice in which divine grace and glory will be displayed for ever. Such is the company which is now being gathered out of the world by the grace of God, a company which finds its centre and object in the Son of God. How completely this carries us outside the range of everything that is of man! Men have set up great church systems and sectarian parties, but here we see the character of what God is doing. All the activity of His grace tends to this result, that there should be a company on earth in the unity of the divine nature and under the sway of the Holy Spirit, a company here for Christ.
May the light of God's gracious purpose shine brightly in each of our hearts, and may we be true to the character of the company to which we belong! Thus may we
{42}
learn, in a deeper and fuller way, our privileges as being of the wondrous company of which Christ speaks as "my assembly".
{43}
A TRUE SERVANT
A letter by C. A. Coates
After reading your letter this morning, I opened my Bible on these words. "There was a man sent from God, his name John. He came for witness, that he might witness concerning the light, that all might believe through him", @John 1: 6,7. This set me thinking of some of the marks of a true servant, as we see them in John -- marks, which I trust, may be more and more imprinted on our lives and service.
First, *he comes from God*. In order to do this, we must first be *with God*. Alas! this is the weak point with so many. The excitement of *service* has an attraction for the natural tastes which the holy calm of the *sanctuary* does not possess. In one way service makes something of us, but in the presence of God we find that we are nothing. Men are needed who are really *with God*. There is no real freshness or power if we are not with God. Our hearts lose their divine sensibilities, we drop down to the level of things around us, and service becomes more or less formal.
The most glorious and soul-stirring realities are soon held as mere doctrines, and of course are preached as they are held. Then very soon the servant begins to feel a complacent self-satisfaction as to his service, which is not disturbed even by the lack of any manifest blessing, and this is the mark, I think, of an awfully backslidden state.
On the other hand, if we are *with God*, we are in spiritual reality as to our own experience. We do not deceive ourselves as to the measure of our progress, gift or faith. We think soberly as we ought to think. Then it is *with God* that we learn His *love*, His unmeasured *grace*,
{44}
His glorious *purposes* His great thoughts concerning Christ and the assembly, the reality of the Spirit's power, and many other things which are accepted in theory by many but known as realities by few. Then having been *with God* in the secret of His presence, we can come *from God* in the power of what we have learnt within, to serve in a world like this. We do not then measure the enemy's power against our own weakness, but against God. We do not put on the armour which others have worn, or follow in the beaten track where other servants have trodden. We do not confer with flesh and blood as to the scope or character of our service. There is an *originality* about every servant who comes from God. God does not fashion two servants in the same mould -- that is man's work -- and just in proportion as we are formed in the sanctuary, each will have his own peculiar fitness for his own service, and such stamp will be upon it that faith will recognise that it comes *from God*.
The second mark of a true servant is that he is *consciously nothing*. John could speak of himself as only a "voice", and a greater than John was consciously "less than the least of all saints". The moment we think ourselves to be anything, we are out of the servant's true position and spirit. There is a beautiful contrast between John's account of himself, and the Lord's description of him (compare @John 1: 22 - 27, with @Luke 7: 20 - 28). The more worthy we are of the Lord's commendation, the less do we think of ourselves.
The third mark of a true servant is that he is a *witness*. He speaks of that which he has seen and known for himself. It was said to Paul that he was to be "a witness both of what thou hast seen, and of what I shall appear to thee in". We may *minister* things which we have never entered into ourselves, but we cannot be *witnesses* of them. Hence the deep importance of cultivating communion with God,
{45}
and increased intimacy with Christ. Instead of this weakening our gospel testimony, I believe it would make it fuller, richer and more simple. We would be in touch with the grace that can stoop to the lowest point to win a sinner's heart. Our preaching often lacks weight because we have so little realised the things of which we speak. Whether it be the terror of the Lord, the love of God, the value of Christ's work, or the blessings which faith enjoys, we must ourselves have entered into that which we press upon others or we became *lecturers* rather than *witnesses*.
Another mark of the true servant is *self-forgetful devotedness to Christ*. John was ready to *decrease* if so be that Christ might *increase*. He was willing to be displaced, to pass into the shade, to be forsaken even by his own disciples. The effect of his witnessing was the proof of its divine reality -- men left John and followed Jesus. This gave him real joy (@John 3:29), for morally he had *left himself* and found his object in that blessed Lamb of God. The result of his testimony was to accomplish in others what had first been effected in himself, and this is the end of true service. We may, through grace, bring others to where we are ourselves, we cannot lift them above our own level. How deeply important it is, then, that we should be vigilant, prayerful, sober, and that we should habitually walk in the Spirit! Christ will then be the object and motive of our whole life and service, and it may be ours to say, in some feeble sense of the greatness and blessedness of it, "For me to live is Christ".
Then the reality of these different characteristics is sure to be tested. Satan will not miss an opportunity of sifting the servant of Christ, and on the other hand, God allows the sifting in order to humble us by the discovery that we are not so spiritual or so devoted as we thought we were; while, in result, the reality of what grace has wrought in us comes out more plainly than ever. The
{46}
servant must not always expect to be in one set of circumstances. The Baptist was, for a time, the most popular man of the day. Tens of thousands attended his ministry, and honoured him as a prophet of God. For a time he was unopposed by the religious leaders and even heard by the king with respect and attention. He was the lion of the hour -- the dictator of morals to every rank in the nation. How many servants have been lifted up with pride in circumstances similar to this in kind, if not in degree! A crowded audience, the approbation of the world, or of the brethren, the esteem rightly due, and cheerfully rendered to a servant honoured of God, and even success in spiritual labours, will act upon these wretched hearts of ours, and lift us up with a carnal elation, if we are not, through grace, in the continual exercise of self-judgment. If John's eye had not been steadily fixed on the glorious Person of whom he was the herald, he might soon have thought himself worthy of some higher station than that of the slave who stoops to loose his master's sandal, but with the divine glory of that One before him, he would not assume to be worthy to render Him even the meanest service. But John was to be tested, like most other servants, in a different way from that of which I have spoken. He must know the north wind of adversity, as well as the south wind of prosperity. He must be transferred from the great congregation of the wilderness, to the solitude and apparent uselessness of the prison, and that, too, at a time when it must have seemed more than ever necessary for all true servants to be spreading with divine energy the gospel of the coming kingdom.
Fancy him like a caged lion, immured in a lonely castle on the dismal shore of the Dead Sea, and hearing there the glorious things that were being spoken of "... in all Judea and in all the surrounding country", @Luke 7:17, 18. Can you wonder that when such reports were
{47}
brought to his ears, his spirit chafed at the confinement which hindered him from having a share in all this? In the day of his prosperity he had said, in effect, that he was *nothing*, but now he was made to enter into it in an experimental way. The kingdom was being preached *without him*: marvellous things were being done in which he had personally no share: God's work was going on *without John*. Let every servant who knows his own heart describe the feelings that are natural to us in such an hour!
I believe every servant of Christ has to pass through this experience sooner or later. He may have it in a modified form all his life through, or he may pass through it in special seasons of deep exercise, or he may learn it on his death-bed, but he *must* learn that he is *nothing but the servant of God's purposes* (@1 Corinthians 3:5 - 7), and that God can dispense with him at any moment and transfer the service to some different vessel of grace. I am aware that we all accept this in theory, but it is another thing to learn it in one's own experience with God. It was when learning this that John was "offended" in the One whose shoe latchet he had professed himself unworthy to bear or unloose. The question which his disciples carried to Jesus (@Luke 7: 19) was a scarcely veiled censure of the Master, for allowing the servant to be detained in circumstances which made nothing of him. It has often been remarked that a saint fails in the very thing by which he is most characterised, and this was the case with John.
It is often in the hour when the servant is brought low in his own eyes, and, it may be, in the eyes of others also, that the pride of his heart discovers itself; and it is well, if in such an hour he bows in submission and does not "kick against the goads" of the Lord's sovereignty. I trust that the marks of a true servant may ever characterise you, that you may be proof against the elevation of the day of success; and that in the day of
{48}
adversity you may not faint, but that you may taste the sweetness of that special beatitude for a tried servant -- "Blessed is whosoever shall not be offended in me".
{49}
NOTES OF A READING
@John 1:6 - 14
C.A.C. It is important that we should think much of the Lord as coming into the world as light. John does not occupy us with what we have been or done but he regards us as being naturally in a condition of darkness. Whether we have been good or bad, as men might judge, we have all been in complete darkness as to God. "Ye were once darkness" (@Ephesians 5:8), Paul says to the gentile Ephesians. This is a deep matter for it brings out the real state of man as away from God through the fall. Whether a man may be good or bad, judged by human standards, makes very little difference if he does not know God. We do need the forgiveness of sins, and to have our burdens lifted, but a deeper question is that we were darkness and we needed light.
Ques. Is it like, "God who spoke that out of darkness light should shine who has shone in our hearts for the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ", @2 Corinthians 4:6?
C.A.C. Yes, that is light, giving the knowledge of God. What we see in @John 1 is that light has come to men in the way of grace, and it shines for every man. That is the force of verse 9, "The true light was that which, coming into the world, lightens every man". It shone for every man; it was not restricted or limited to the Jew. The Lord says, "I am come into the world as light". Our knowledge of God depends on receiving light; we have no knowledge of Him in any other way. God has not only sent light, but in His grace and consideration for men He has provided witness to the light. John came for witness,
{50}
and God has given many witnesses to the light, every witness in Scripture is to Christ, and all the light of God is in Him.
Ques. Is there any difference between light and revelation?
C.A.C. Light is that there is illumination for men so that they may know the true character of God. It is a public shining, whereas revelation would seem to be rather what is communicated individually. See @Matthew 11:25, 27; @Matthew 16:17. God has shone out as made known in love, and there is no need now for any man to be in darkness.
Ques. Does that explain the difference between "God is light" and God "is in the light"?
C.A.C. "God is light" is a marvellous message heard from Him; "In Him is no darkness at all". And now He "is in the light"; that is, He is not hidden behind clouds and in thick darkness. He is made known in love through His beloved Son. That is the light in which christians walk. We walk in the light of God made known in love. There is no other light in which to walk, and it has come to us mediatorially in the Person of the Lord Jesus.
Ques. What is the meaning of "out of darkness light should shine", @2 Corinthians 4:6?
C.A.C. That is a reference to @Genesis 1. The first speaking of God in creation was that there should be light, and there was light. When all was universal darkness God spoke; He commanded that light should be, and light was. Saul of Tarsus was in complete darkness without a ray of light as to God; but the same God, who commanded light to be at the beginning of creation, shone in Saul's heart for the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. It shone in Paul's heart that it might shine forth through the gospel to the nations. The great thing that men need is light as to God, but what men call light is often the grossest darkness. When God
{51}
commanded that out of darkness light should shine, it did shine without the darkness contributing anything to it. It is like that in the souls of men. There is darkness and then suddenly light as to God comes. Though the light is there all the time yet it needs an operation of God in the soul to enable men to perceive it. The state of the world was darkness and light came into it, but the darkness was so dense and impenetrable that it did not apprehend the light. That shows that no amount of light that God can give will meet the case. If God sends the greatest light possible, men do not apprehend it. The darkness cannot and will not apprehend it.
Rem. I suppose we have no idea of the tremendous darkness in which we once were.
C.A.C. I am sure we have a very feeble sense of the terrible character of the fall, and therefore we have a feeble sense of the intervention of God in reference to it. We see here, "He was in the world and the world had its being through him and the world knew him not". The world did not know its Creator. There is nothing in man to build on; he is lost and dead; there is not a pulsation in the natural man that answers to God. We have to face that; it is a solemn reality. Man is lost and dead in darkness. Even if God gives man religious privileges, as He did to the Jews, we read in verse 11 that "He came to his own, and his own received him not". That identifies the Lord Jesus with Jehovah. In Him Jehovah came to "his own", to a people He had been educating, teaching, dealing with in His discipline and government for two thousand years! He came to them and they would not receive Him. Jehovah came into the world, and the people He had nurtured and cared for would not receive Him. They were men with all the religious advantages that God could give them; and man is not a bit better today than he was then. So if we had not the next verse the thing would be altogether
{52}
hopeless, but the next verse brings in the thought of an operation of God whereby men are born of God and that is the only thing that will meet the case.
At the present time God is working in sovereign love so that there may be persons who will receive the light. If this mighty secret working of God did not take place all would be hopeless, notwithstanding light being given to men. But if the world does not know Him and His own will not receive Him, there are those who do receive Him because they are born of God. No one receives the light but those who are born of God.
In John everything is seen from the divine side. Those who receive Christ as the great Light as to God are entitled to take the place of being children of God. All those who know God as made known by His Son are His children. His family thought is realised. Such are born into the family of God by His own sovereign act so as to have a nature which is of God. Such a nature welcomes every ray of light as to God, and finds the effulgence of God in His Son. It is a question here not of doing but of receiving -- a question of taking in what is expressed in Christ. Men are born of God that they may take it in. The Lord constantly recognised that there was nothing to be trusted in man except what was wrought of God. He said, "No one can come to me except the Father who has sent me draw him".
Ques. Then how would you preach the gospel?
C.A.C. What John presents is not exactly the gospel as you would preach it to sinners. You would go rather to Luke for that, and to the Acts of the Apostles to see how they preached, while the doctrine of it is in @Romans 1 - 5, John presents things from the side of divine sovereignty and the work of God in men.
Ques. Would it not be right in preaching the gospel to announce that man is lost?
{53}
C.A.C. The preaching of Christ exposes the whole state and need of man as nothing else does. I do not think we have a better idea of how to preach the gospel than the apostles had!
Ques. What about new birth?
C.A.C. It is God's sovereign act, and it is thus in keeping with what is said here of those who receive Christ, that they are born of God. It is not that we are born of God by receiving Christ, but we are born of God in order that we may receive Christ; no one will receive Christ unless he is born of God. But to make that known is not quite the gospel. It might be right under certain circumstances to press on people that they must be born again, because we preach to people who profess to be christians, but to state that is not the gospel. The gospel is the preaching of Christ. The Acts of the Apostles is the finest college for any preacher to go to! We need to study the preaching in the Acts and see what the apostles preached. They preached Christ; they did not talk much about their hearers, but they announced the grace that was for them, and a solemn warning in case of rejecting it. The whole substance of their preaching was Christ, and we cannot improve on it. The gospel is the presentation of Christ as God's salvation, and if we had more power to preach Christ we should see more conversions. If I have received Christ as the light of God made known in love I am entitled to take the place of one of the children of God. I have an entirely new nature by actual birth into the family of God; we come into the family of God by being born of God. It is a generative act on God's part.
Ques. Does the gospel bring that to light?
C.A.C. Yes. When we preach Christ we find certain people deeply interested. A crowd may come to the preaching and go away like a door turning on its hinges, but among them there may be one soul intent on receiving
{54}
light from God in Christ. Now that one is born of God, and those born of God ever retain an intense interest in divine light; they want more of the light of God. That is what brings believers together week after week, and year after year. They come together to consider the Scriptures and to hear ministry. They want more of the light of God, and it is all to be found mediatorially in His beloved Son. The ability to perceive and receive it comes through a marvellous act on God's part -- such are born of God; "not of blood" -- it is not a question of natural descent. It is not because my father was a believer that I am one, and it is not of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man in any shape or form. It is of God.
This Scripture looks at the thing in its completeness; the operation that brings us into the family of God is entirely of God, and the effect is that the light becomes precious; every ray of light seen in Christ is valued; we find certain persons who never lose their interest in Christ. It may be said that they are a poor lot, and it may be possible to point out many defects in them, but it is a wonderful thing to see persons in this world who never lose their interest in Christ and are always glad to get one more ray of light in Christ. This is not a question of what we do but of how we appreciate the light of God in Christ; that is far more to God than anything we can do. It is far more to God that I should appreciate His precious light in His beloved Son than that I should go as a missionary or do any other great thing. We come together on Lord's day morning because of the intensity of our appreciation of God's blessed Son, and because we love to respond to Him. God's great design is that Christ shall be the Centre and Sun of a universe of bliss. He is educating us for that. People may say we are lazy and do not do what we might. No doubt that is true, and we would not excuse slothfulness in service, but it is of very great importance to get a
{55}
right sense of relative values, and to see that our reception and appreciation of divine light in the Son of God is more to divine Persons than any service could be. If it were merely a question of work God could send twelve legions of angels who could do more in one minute than the church has done in two thousand years! But that is not what God is after; His great work is to bring light as to Himself into the hearts of men.
Ques. Are the operations of God limited? Or are they for all men?
C.A.C. Nothing is clearer in Scripture than that God's salvation in Christ is for all men, and His Spirit strives with men in the preachings and in other ways also. But neither the salvation that is in Christ, nor the Spirit's strivings with men will in themselves produce a result for God. We must face the fact that unless there is a work of God in man all the striving of the Spirit with men will be resisted. Stephen said, "Ye do always resist the Holy Spirit". And man, as such, will always neglect the great salvation. But when God comes in and breaks down a man, that is divine working in the man. In @Acts 2 they were pricked in their hearts and say, "What must we do?" -- that was the result of a work by the Spirit in their consciences and hearts. The most wonderful preaching that ever was will effect nothing unless God works by His Spirit in men's hearts. We are not on the side of man's responsibility here, but a scripture like this gives us to see that if things were left to man's responsibility alone every child of Adam's race would be lost eternally.
To love darkness rather than light is worse than to be a murderer, thief or drunkard; it is far worse than any immoral conduct because it indicates hatred of God. It proves what Scripture says, that "the mind of the flesh is enmity against God". The light comes in love now, and to love darkness rather than light is terrible. "This is the
{56}
judgment, that light is come into the world, and men have loved darkness rather than light; for their works were evil", @John 3:19. The light is the light of God in love, for those words immediately follow "God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal". That is light, and if men love darkness rather than light it is because their works are evil and they will be judged. At the great white throne men will be judged according to their works. God will have men to be brought to repentance and saved, and He gives light to that end, but men hate it. They do not love the light because they want to go on in sin; the secret is that their works are evil; that is they are not wrought in God. See @John 3: 20,21. Nothing in man is of any value in God's sight that is not the fruit of His own working. The gospel is a commandment, for it is God's command that we should repent and believe on His Son Jesus Christ (@Acts 17:30; @1 John 3:23). The gospel is made known according to commandment of the eternal God (@Romans 16:26). If men do not believe the gospel they rebel against the authority of God. Every one who comes under the sound of the gospel, and does not believe it, is not only despising the grace and love of God, but is setting himself in defiance of the authority of God. Men would rather believe any nonsense, such as evolution, than have light from God. God has done everything to make blessing possible to men. He gives men light as to the provision He has made for their blessing. Christ is God's salvation to the ends of the earth. He is light and salvation shining for every man, but such is the state of man's heart relative to God that he does not care to have God's blessing, though knowing that without it he must perish. Man hates the gospel more than he hates the law, because the law seems to give man the place of doing something, but the gospel is wholly of God. It is sad to
{57}
think that the more God is made known to a lost creature the more is demonstrated the terrible state of alienation from Him in which that creature is found.
In verse 14 we come to the marvellous statement that the Word became flesh. It is the first mention in this gospel of the condition into which Christ came. Previously He is spoken of as the light; that is, what was there morally in Him. But now we have the condition into which He came; He has become flesh. The One who was God according to verse 1 became flesh. It is not He was made it but He became it; it was His own act as a divine Person. Becoming flesh brings before us how tangible it was. He actually came into that condition in which man lives; man lives in the flesh but He became flesh. That is essential to His mediatorship. He became flesh and dwelt among us. John presses very much the thought of His coming in flesh; he makes it the test of the antichrist. "Every spirit which does not confess Jesus Christ come in flesh is not of God: and this is that power of the antichrist", @1 John 4:3. There were many in the early days of the church who believed that the Lord was only in appearance a man. The first attack of the enemy on the truth was to assert that the Lord was only in the appearance of a man just like the Old Testament appearances of God. John meets that by saying 'He became flesh'.
The verse now before us brings out the unique character of His flesh. He has come into man's condition in very deed and truth. He became flesh, but it was flesh altogether different from any other flesh. It must be so if the blessed God became flesh; and His flesh must be of its own order; no other kind of flesh or humanity could be like it.

THE BRIGHT AND MORNING STAR
@John 1: 29 - 39; @Matthew 25: 1 - 10; @Revelation 22: 16, 17, 20
It would hardly be questioned, I suppose, that for a number of years there has been considerable interest amongst believers generally in truths connected with the second coming of the Lord. Nor could it be denied that those truths have been very widely accepted by the children of God. It is a very striking feature of God's ways with His saints that so much attention has been called to these truths during the present century. The significance of this has been often pointed out. There can be no doubt that the moment of the Lord's return draws nigh, and "it is high time to awake out of sleep". In view of this I desire to bring before you the scriptures I have read, and I trust they may come to our hearts in freshness and power as a present ministry from the Lord.
I want to press the importance of *personal acquaintance with the One who is coming*. There cannot be much desire for His coming on the part of those who are not personally acquainted with Him. And I think the great mark of personal acquaintance is that we seek His company. I cannot believe there is much true desire for His coming in any heart that does not seek His company *now*.
The passage I read from @John 1 shows us how two disciples became personally acquainted with Christ. He was so presented to their hearts, and they were so attracted to Him that their one desire was to be in His company. Now, beloved brethren, I bring this before you because I am convinced that it is this alone which will make us "ready" in our affections for the return of the Bridegroom
{59}
and enable us to say "Come" in concert with "the Spirit and the bride". It is all very well to read books and hear addresses on the second coming of the Lord, and to search the Scriptures on the subject, but something more than this is needed to make us "ready" to meet Him.
I take for granted that I am addressing believers on the Lord Jesus Christ. You know that your sins are forgiven; you rejoice in the assurance that by the one offering of Christ you are "perfected for ever". As to any imputation of sin you are clear through your Saviour's blood. You are justified. We must begin with this. A purged conscience and the Spirit as a divine link with Christ in glory, are needed before Christ can really be the object of the heart. He is presented to us here, first as the Lamb of God, then as the Baptiser with the Holy Spirit, and thirdly as the attractive and satisfying object of the hearts of His own.
God could not come out in the way of blessing to man until He had been glorified about sin. But the Lamb of God went into the place of sin that He might put it away by the sacrifice of Himself, and the first consequence of His death was that the "veil of the temple was rent in two, from the top to the bottom". The way was open for God to come out in the fullest blessing, and in the glory of unmingled grace. God is a Saviour God. If there is one here who feels that death and judgment are his due, I can say to you that the Lamb of God has been under judgment and in death that He might remove every barrier that stood between your soul and the blessing of God. I can say to every repentant sinner -- to every believer in Jesus -- that not only is every barrier righteously removed, but the way in which they have been removed is the most wonderful and blessed testimony to *the love of God*. "God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us", @Romans 5:8 A.V.
{60}
And now the Lamb of God is seated in all the light and glory of the Father's throne. A shining track has been made from the depths of death and judgment to the heights of glory. We follow that shining track through the opened heavens to the right hand of God. We can go in. No device of hell can separate the redeemed from the Redeemer, or hinder Him from bringing the "many sons to glory". By His one offering we are perfected for ever; our consciences purged; we have peace with God. Every believer in Jesus is before God in the infinite efficacy of the blood of the Lamb, and is in God's sight "whiter than snow".
Then, further, the Son of God as risen and glorified is the Baptiser with the Holy Spirit. By His death we are cleared of everything that attached to us as children of Adam, and now by the gift of the Holy Spirit we have a link with Him in the place where He is. All that the grace of God has effected for us by the work of Christ was in view of our having a link with Him. It is inconceivable blessing. We are cleared that we might have a link with the One who has cleared us. Alas! it is to be feared that, with many, the Holy Spirit is grieved and hindered, and is not at liberty to make good this link with Christ in the hearts of believers. But where this is the case the believer reaps but little benefit from the Spirit. The normal action of the Spirit would be to form a link of affection between the believer and Christ. And this would naturally result in His becoming the object of our hearts, and His company the supreme desire of our souls.
The great gain of having the Spirit is that He makes the glory of Christ shine in the believer's heart, and this we see in figure in the two disciples who heard John speak. The glory of Christ shone into their hearts, and separated them from everything here. They were ready for His company, for He had thrown everything else into the shade, and made Himself supreme in their affections.
{61}
They had previously been disciples of the greatest servant of God upon earth at the moment, but when the *Son of God* came into the vision of their hearts they left John. The glory of Christ eclipsed everything for them, and captivated their hearts. "One thing" they desired and sought after -- His company. And this shows that they must have had a sense of His love. They might not have been able to explain it, but His love had established itself in their hearts. It is love that desires the company of its object. The Father was drawing them to Christ by giving them a sense of the blessedness of the love of Christ. And, beloved brethren, it is not otherwise today. Would that all our hearts had a sense of this. The Father is working by the Spirit to bring about the same result today. I trust many here know something experimentally of the reality of this; and if not, that we may be thoroughly awakened in heart, and exercised in conscience about our condition.
We are here as professed followers of Christ, and He challenges all our hearts at this moment with the searching question, "What seek ye?" Ah, *He knows* what we are after, but He challenges our hearts that we may be obliged, as it were, to declare ourselves. It is good sometimes to be obliged to give account of ourselves. Now are we prepared to be thus challenged? Are we so clear of the world, and so free from the tastes and motives of the flesh, that we can meet the challenge without confusion of face? Do our secret hours bear witness to the fact that we long after Himself? Or do they find us occupied with the ledger, the newspaper or with a thousand things that pertain to this life and to the world, so that -- though we may sometimes sigh in the weariness of our way, and the Spirit of God may occasionally turn our souls heavenward with desire to breathe the atmosphere of divine love in the company of Christ -- it cannot be said that we really "seek" His company at all?
{62}
The two whose course we are following were prepared for the challenge. Nay, it must have fallen on their ears as a most welcome sound, assuring and encouraging them. Such a challenge was just what their hearts desired. It gave them an opportunity to declare themselves, and to put themselves in touch with Him. Now, beloved, is it so with ourselves? Do our souls make us like "the chariots of my willing people" to run after Him? He will cause those that love Him to "inherit substance" and He will "fill their treasuries"; and He says, "They that seek me early shall find me". May it be so that, going after Him with purpose of heart, we may be able to answer His challenge in the spirit of earnest inquiry, "Rabbi, where abidest thou?"
The great blessedness of the Lord's gracious response, "Come and see", has often, I am sure, been food for our hearts. They are wonderful words if we consider all that is implied in them. It is the place "where he abode" that they were invited to "come and see". I suppose the youngest babe in Christ would instinctively understand that the Spirit of God intended to convey in these words something far deeper than the thought of a material dwelling-place. The glory that attracted the hearts of the two disciples to that Blessed One was a *moral* glory -- a glory of divine perfections and love which only anointed eyes could discern or appreciate -- and the place "where he abode" speaks to our hearts of a moral dwelling-place suited to Himself. In a word, the two disciples wanted to know Him *in His own circle*, and His love conferred upon them the freedom of that circle.
I should like to bring another scripture into your minds in connection with this subject: @John 20: 11 - 20. Here we find another captivated heart -- another follower -- another *seeker*. What were the best things of the earth to Mary's heart? Religion was keeping its high day in Jerusalem, but not for her. The excitement of the political
{63}
circle was engrossing thousands, but its burning questions had no place in her heart. No doubt the cares of this life were known by her as by any of us, but they reigned not in her spirit. She had but one *grief*, as the disciples in chapter 1 had but one *Object*. His *presence* created a new world for their hearts, and His *absence* desolated the old world for Mary's heart. It cannot be said that she was strong in *faith* or *hope*, but she stands conspicuous for LOVE to His blessed Person. "They have taken away my Lord". It may be she had little thought of where He dwelt, but it was the same affection which led the two disciples to ask, "Rabbi, where abidest thou?" that prompted her to say, "Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away". And the same voice that had said, "Come and see", opened up to her a new world of everlasting love, and brought her consciously into a new association with Himself outside all the desolation of this scene of death, as by the one word "Mary" He called her into the presence of His unchanged and living love.
He revealed Himself to Mary, as He in figure to the two disciples, *in His own circle*, and He made her the bearer of the wondrous message which was, we might say, the complete unfolding of all that was involved in the words, "Come and see". He was no longer to be touched and known in the old associations "after the flesh" but by the Spirit He might be touched in His new place as ascended to the Father. He takes a new place, but He will have His brethren in the most complete association with Himself in that new place. "I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". In this way He invites us to "come and see" His dwelling-place, and to share it with Him.
But let none of us think lightly of this wondrous privilege, for He could only secure it for us by *His death*.
{64}
As in the flesh we could never be in association with Christ, and if He had not died this holy privilege could never have been ours. Blessed be His name, He has removed in death, to the glory of God, all that we were as children of Adam. His death has ended our history before God as in the flesh, and divested us in the presence of infinite love of every trace of unsuitability to that love. How could we be free in His company if we did not know this? How could He claim us as His brethren on any other ground? Well may we adore Him for the triumphs of His love.
<blockquote>'From the triumph and the glory <br>Of Thy rest in love divine, <br>Comes to us the wondrous story, <br>How God's purpose made us Thine; </blockquote><p><blockquote>How by dying Thou hast freed us <br>From the man of sin and shame, <br>That, unhindered, Thou mightst lead us <br>Now to know Thy Father's name'. (`61:3)</blockquote>
It is as we enter into this that our hearts are drawn to Him, and we find ourselves in spirit outside everything that is of the world and of the flesh. And until we know something of the reality of this we cannot be said to be in heart "ready" for His return.
The effect of Mary's message was to gather the disciples together outside everything that was of man. They were outside everything because of what Christ was to their hearts. Their hearts were illuminated by His love. With the doors shut to exclude the religious man after the flesh, they had the company of Christ and were glad. The world was only to them the scene of His rejection and death. And thus they were fitted to be sent by Him into the world of His interests. This was the beginning of christianity. Can you imagine what the church would
{65}
have been if she had maintained her first love? A company of hearts espoused to Christ, and satisfied with His company and love, and walking in strangership and rejection here in loyalty to Him. Surely if we got a true thought of it we should be ready to weep over the condition of the church today.
I now pass on to the second scripture which we read at the beginning (@Matthew 25 ). This scripture is of great importance because it brings together in one view (1) the first love of the church, (2) the decline of that love, and (3) the awakening and revival thereof so as to make the wise virgins "ready" for the return of the bridegroom.
1. The virgins "took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom". I do not intend to occupy you at this time with the foolish virgins, who set forth the lament able condition of those who have the profession of christianity without the reality of its blessings. The wise virgins represent the company of true saints who have "oil in their vessels"; that is, they have received the Spirit. All such at the beginning went forth to meet the Bridegroom. Their hearts were engaged with Himself, and they left every earthly association to have the joy of His company. This is what marked them -- they sought His company. This is the great characteristic of first love.
2. "Now the bridegroom tarrying, they all grew heavy and slept". Here we see in picture the state of things which rapidly succeeded the pentecostal brightness. How soon the Lord had to say, "But I have against thee, that thou hast left thy first love", @Revelation 2:4. He had lost His place in their hearts, and if that is the case the christian slumbers and sleeps. It may sound like a paradox, but I have no doubt there may be works, and labour, and endurance, and much fidelity in respect of many things, while the heart slumbers and sleeps. (See @Revelation 2:2 - 5). What is the value of scripture knowledge, or of correct
{66}
views on prophecy and ecclesiastical principles, if our *hearts* are sound asleep? You may ask, What is it to grow heavy and sleep? Well, I think it is to lose the consciousness of our association with Christ, so that the believer settles down into things here. If our hearts lose the consciousness of our association with Christ we are sure to become earthly-minded. And this is what has happened to the church. "All seek their own things, not the things of Jesus Christ", says Paul to the Philippians; and again, "For many walk, of whom I have told you often, ... even weeping, ... who mind earthly things". It is this which has brought the church into the state of spiritual weakness and ruin in which it is found today. The virgins have grown heavy and slept.
3. "But in the middle of the night there was a cry, Behold, the bridegroom; go forth to meet him". Here we see the intervention of God to bring about the result that there should be a company "ready" to meet the Bridegroom. And I think none would deny that there has been a very remarkable intervention of God in the actual history of the church. Every one of us here has benefited by that intervention, some, it may be, to a very great degree. We have only to go back some four hundred years to find the almost universal sway of priestcraft and superstition in the church. No doubt God maintained His elect all through, but so far as any public light or testimony was concerned there was a long period of appalling and almost unbroken darkness. The Reformation was a loud cry which echoed far and wide amid the darkness, and it was followed by other movements which, though not attracting the same amount of public attention, produced probably a far deeper spiritual result amongst many who had been delivered as a consequence of the first movement from the thraldom of Rome. The present century has witnessed the recovery of much precious truth unknown to the church
{67}
since apostolic days; and within the last few years the Person of Christ, and the blessedness of the saints¬ association with Him in new creation, have been presented in a remarkable way to the hearts of believers. It is impossible to doubt that in this way the awakening cry, "Behold, the bridegroom", has gone forth in a very distinct manner. Nor has it been without effect. Many have left the religious associations and human systems in which they were found. There has been, to some extent at any rate, a going out and a trimming of lamps.
I believe it is of immense importance for us to recognise the true nature of the present testimony of the Holy Spirit. It is the presentation of Christ Himself to the hearts of His own -- "Behold the bridegroom". We have often heard that the point of departure is the point of recovery. The point of departure in the church was when CHRIST lost His supreme place in the hearts of His own; and there is no recovery until He regains it. Some have thought that the cry, "Behold the bridegroom", was figurative of the revival of prophetic truth. No doubt God has graciously given much light on prophecy during the present century, but it has been only the necessary accompaniment of truths "as to Christ, and as to the assembly". I do not believe the Spirit of God would occupy us with a series of prophetic facts; His mission is to present a Person. And I cannot help warning my younger brethren against much literature that is abroad on prophetic subjects. Books and pamphlets which occupy you with events and dates, and especially those which connect events occurring at the present time with prophecy, are to be shunned. The effect of them is to occupy souls very much with what is going on in the world, and I am sure the Spirit of God is not seeking to do this. He would present to our hearts the One who is in glory, and separate us even now to His company outside everything that is going on here.
{68}
"Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their torches". Here we see the effect of the midnight cry. The presentation of the Person who is coming immediately awakens exercise. It raises the question in the soul, 'Am I suitable to Him?' If there is no exercise of this kind, it is a sure indication that the soul is asleep. The exercise of every awakened heart leads to the discovery that the lamp needs trimming -- that there is that which needs to be judged and removed, so that we may be in conscious suitability to the One who is coming. When our hearts are illuminated by His love we are in conscious suitability to Him. It is not here a question of being perfected for ever by His one offering, of being cleansed by His blood, but of conscious suitability to Him by the Spirit. Many a believer who has no doubt as to the efficacy of His work is far from being in conscious suitability to Him, and where this is the case the lamp needs trimming. We do not reach this suitability without exercise, and may God enable each one of us to trim our lamps.
There are three steps by which the Spirit of God would lead us, if unhindered, into conscious suitability to Christ.
1. "I am crucified with Christ, and no longer live, I, but Christ lives in me; but in that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me", @Galatians 2:20. Paul was conscious of a love which had divested him at its own cost of everything that was unsuited to itself. All that he was as a child of Adam had gone in the death of Christ from before God's eye, and he was so in accord with this -- he had so reached it experimentally -- that he could say, "I am crucified with Christ". He recognised nothing as life to God but Christ living in him; and the One who had thus set him free in the presence of divine love from all that attached to him as a man in the flesh was now the object of his heart.
{69}
If you are saying, 'Oh that I could be in suitability to Christ! but I cannot improve my wretched self, and I cannot get rid of it', I should like you to consider the infinite love that is here brought before us. The Son of God has undertaken in love to remove all my unsuitability, and to accomplish this He has given Himself. He has gone into death that He might free me from myself, and have me for Himself. And by His death I am entitled to be with God and with His Son as one set free from all that was attached to me as a child of Adam. I think we could not help being drawn to the Lord if we realised this. As another has said, 'He has cleared the ground that He might occupy it'. It is a wonderful moment in the soul's history when it gets the consciousness of being *loved by the Son of God*. It is a most blessed thing to know Him in His greatness and glory, and to know that there is an eternal link of love between Him and me -- love, which has removed, for its own satisfaction and at its own cost, everything that I am morally as of the race of Adam, so that I might be free in the presence of that love. The Holy Spirit would illuminate our hearts with the light of this love. And with the light and warmth of this love pervading our hearts, the dim and worthless, though often cherished, idols of the earth, would retire into the shade to which they properly belong, and heaven would become supremely attractive because of the One who is there. We have not merely deliverance, but the personal love of a Deliverer.
2. "For both he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren", @Hebrews 2: 11. Here we see a further un folding of what His love has effected. It is not only that all our unsuitability as belonging to Adam's race has been removed in His death, but we are now in association with the One who has removed it. We are of Him; we derive from Him; we are "all of one" with Him. This is not the
{70}
flesh sanctified; it is not Christ made "all of one" with our flesh, as modern theology so falsely teaches; it is not our flesh made "all of one" with Him; it is a new creation in which we are altogether apart from the flesh, associated in life and relationship with Christ risen, so that His Father is our Father, and His God our God. He is not ashamed to call us brethren, because in this new creation order there is no disparity between Himself and those whom He has sanctified. We are all "of one" with Him. The Holy Spirit would light up our hearts with the glory and love of this wondrous association with Christ.
3. "Unless I wash thee, thou hast not part with me", @John 13:8. Such is the love of Christ that He cannot be satisfied without our company. It is to secure this that His priesthood is exercised to lift us above every pressure here, that we may join Him in the sanctuary. For this He washes our feet to free us from the influences of this present scene, so that we may have part with Him. To this end He is presented to our hearts by the Holy Spirit in the Scriptures, and in all true ministry, that our hearts may be drawn away from earth, where He is not, to the scene of His exaltation and glory. He wants our company. His love delights to share with us the joys of that blessed world where He has gone and make us familiar with the Father's presence -- in a word, to have us near Himself.
Now, beloved brethren, is the light of all this love shining brightly in our hearts? I know that these precious things are true *for* all believers, but they are not made good *to* us until we appropriate them. They are things which have to be experimentally reached through exercise of soul. Every bit of Canaan from Dan to Beersheba belonged to the children of Israel by divine gift, but they had to take possession, and they did not *possess* any more than what their feet trod upon. Many of us are familiar with these scriptures but I put it first to myself and then
{71}
to everyone here. Is *the love of Christ* the present illumination and joy of your heart? *If not, the lamp needs trimming*. It is the blessed work of the Holy Spirit to maintain the light of Christ's love in our hearts -- He would feed the flame of love in our souls -- but this will not be the case if we are wrapped up in the slumber of earthly-mindedness. Nor will it be realised apart from exercise on our part. It is of necessity that the lamp should be trimmed. I venture to say that with each one of us there are things which are a hindrance to the Spirit of God; but if our hearts are truly awakened it will be our joy to disallow and set aside everything that obstructs and grieves that Holy One. It may be with some of us there are links with the world that have never been broken. Many believers are like two men who got into a boat to row across a river one very dark night. They pulled away some time without reaching the opposite side, and eventually discovered they had forgotten to loosen the rope that fastened the boat to the bank of the river. Beloved brethren, have we no links that need to be severed, links with the world that hinder our spiritual progress, and grieve the Holy Spirit, and cause the light of divine love to burn dim in our hearts? "Wake up, thou that sleepest, and arise up from among the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee".
It may cost us something to trim our lamps, but who can measure the gain? A single eye will inevitably lead to a trimmed lamp. That is, the heart in which Christ is supreme is sure to be diligent in the judgment and renunciation of what is not Christ. Then the lamp will be trimmed, and the whole body be "full of light". This is first love. Christ is everything, and the soul is in conscious suitability to Him. The awakened virgins with trimmed lamps got back to the point of departure. Then they were "ready" for the return of the Bridegroom.
{72}
Enoch in his day was "ready". It is not at all surprising that God translated him. He had walked apart from earth's din and noise in moral suitability to God for three hundred years, and his translation was, if one might so say, the appropriate termination of such a course. Translation was not a great moral change for him. His circumstances were changed in a very wonderful way, I admit, but morally he had been "with God" for centuries. He was in moral suitability for translation. He was "ready". I do not think his departure created a gap in the political or social circles of the day. He had been outside all that for hundreds of years.
Elijah, too, had been apart from the idolatrous nation before he was translated. He was taking no part in the course of things around him. He was morally "ready" to go out of the world altogether. God grant that in this sense we may be "ready" for the return of the Bridegroom. I believe the special ministry of the Lord at the present time is to bring about this result, and all the activities of the Holy Spirit are to this end. God grant that we may know how to profit by it all. Christ becoming so really our treasure that our hearts may be *with Him*; and in result that our loins may be girded about, and our lights burning, and we ourselves like unto men that wait for their Lord.
I turn now, for a few moments, to @Revelation 22:16, 17,20. There is something inexpressibly sweet and precious -- something which lays hold of the heart with singular power -- in this last presentation of the Lord Jesus to the hearts of His own. Such a comprehensive view of His blessed Person in varied characters -- such a combination of suggestive titles -- is rarely to be found in such brief compass.
First the sweet personal name by which He made Himself known to us in our deep need as sinners -- the
{73}
sacred and saving name -- "*I* Jesus". In thus presenting Himself to our hearts does He not recall the untold grace in which He stooped so low that He might bring divine love into contact with all our sin and woe? Bethlehem, Nazareth, the shores of Galilee, come afresh before our hearts as we think of that name, and the wondrous story of Calvary is woven into its precious syllables. "*I* Jesus". How it carries us back to the moment when our leprous souls first felt His cleansing touch -- when first His hand of tenderness and might was laid upon our restless and fevered spirits -- when first the healing virtue flowed forth from Him, responsive to faith's feeble touch -- when first the music of His voice filled our hearts with gladness as we heard Him say, "Thy sins are forgiven ... ; go in peace", and a great calm overspread our consciences, storm-tossed with doubt and fear.
But this book reveals Him in other scenes -- His eyes as a flame of fire; His voice as the sound of many waters; the glory-throne His rightful seat; the many crowns upon His brow; the Kingly name on vesture and on thigh; yet still to His own He speaks as "*I* Jesus". For them He still wears -- and delights to wear -- His name of saving love. What could appeal more sweetly to our hearts?
"*I* Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies". Here we see Him as the Prophet making known the mind and ways of God, not indeed in the intimacy of affections, as when He declares the Father's name to His brethren, but in that administrative way in which He makes known the truth of God from time to time as it is needed in the assemblies of His saints. For this there is a medium of communication -- "*I* ... have sent mine angel". It cannot be doubted that the Lord still acts in a way similar to this. He sends a ministry by some chosen vessel or vessels suited to the condition of His saints and the present ways of God in the actual history
{74}
of the church. Who can doubt that there was such a special ministry in the days of Luther and J.N.D., not to mention others less distinctly known? Truth from God suited to His present ways was declared in the days of these men "in the assemblies". Of course no new revelation was communicated, but special prominence was given to the truth needed at the time. We may look for, and count upon, this to the end. May we ever have an ear to hear the present testimony of the Lord in the assemblies.
"I am the root and the offspring of David". Jehovah's choice and promises in sovereign grace made David great. All that David was in a divine sense he derived from Jehovah -- it was to Jehovah that he owed all the glory and power of his kingdom. Jehovah was the source of all those promises of kingly glory which, throughout the word of God, connect themselves with David and his seed. It is this that I understand to be conveyed in the expression, "I am the root ... of David". All that pertained to Jehovah is thus assumed in the most distinct way by Jesus. The Deity of the Messiah -- so plainly asserted by @Hebrews 1 -- thus shines fully and clearly forth.
As the Root of David He bestowed the promises, but as David's Offspring He will inherit them all in manhood. He is coming soon to bring all the glory in -- to bind Messiah's honours upon His brow and reign before His ancients gloriously -- to present in His own Person, and to secure by His power, all that is promised in the prophecies of the Old Testament. In coming into manhood He inherited the titles and honours of the Messiah, and He will yet manifestly assume and display them. "The Lord God shall give him the throne of David his father; and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for the ages, and of his kingdom there shall not be an end", @Luke 1: 32,33.
"I Jesus" carries our hearts back to the days of His humiliation, and fills them with thoughts of the love which
{75}
stooped so low to win and secure us for Himself. The "offspring of David" makes our hearts glow with anticipation of that coming day of glory which will soon shed its brightness from pole to pole, and from the river to the ends of the earth. But what have we in the interval between the day of His humiliation and the day of His supremacy? While the dark night of His rejection casts its shade on everything here, while the church mourns her absent Bridegroom, while men claim His inheritance as their own, and while declension and apostasy are written large upon that which bears His name, what is faith's resource and joy? It is Himself, who, hidden from the eyes of a sleeping world, shines upon our hearts in heavenly lustre and beauty as "the bright and morning star".
Then "do not let us sleep, as the rest do" for the waking and watchful eye alone is refreshed by the Star in the sky. If we miss the blessed opportunity, which is ours now, of knowing our Saviour and Lord in this character, we shall never have it again. In the days of glory He will be known in other characters, but as the Bright and Morning Star He can only be known during the *night* of His rejection. Many peculiar privileges belong to those who are called by infinite grace to know Him in the times of His rejection, and not the least of these privileges is the blessed intimacy of a personal knowledge of Himself as the bright and morning Star. The empty glory of the world, and the self-aggrandisement and self-complacency of an unfaithful church become grief and sorrow to a heart that thus knows the Lord. For such a heart the shadow of His rejection rests on everything *here*, while every ray that shines from that Star is bright with divine love that attracts to its own circle everyone who truly knows it. If I have lost the world and its things, what have I gained? I have a Person, and the love of that Person for my heart. And when I think who that Person is, and how He has brought
{76}
divine love to me, and how He draws my heart to Himself in an ineffable scene of divine affections, I begin to taste divine satisfaction.
Then I can say, "Come". The soul must be satisfied before it can say, "Come". I say, "Come", because I know the blessedness of the Person, and of all that He will bring.
I am so enjoying it all in my heart -- so living in it in the knowledge of Himself -- that I cannot help saying, "Come". It is the spontaneous expression of a satisfied heart that feels the immeasurable need and loss of the scene where He is not; the expression, too, of bridal affection which desires to see Him honoured and supreme in the place where He died.
The effect of really knowing Him as the Bright and Morning Star is that, in concert with the Spirit and the bride, we say, "Come". Our lamps are trimmed: we are "*ready*". We are in spiritual suitability to the One who is coming. May it be so with us.
{77}
THE DIVINE EFFECT OF THE TRUTH
@John 1: 35 - 39; @John 20: 17 - 20
Just one thought is upon my mind in connection with these scriptures -- the great importance of being divinely affected by the truth. If the truth does not form and move us it shows that we are only taking it up in the letter. There is not much advantage in this, for a man who has the letter of truth without its spirit is offensive to God. I admit that this is a solemn assertion, but it is nevertheless a true one. The Pharisee and the lawyer are more repugnant to God than the publican and the sinner. The Pharisee and the lawyer are men well up in the externals and shell of the truth, but entirely unaffected by its kernel and spirit. The divine effect of truth is to mould and to move men.
In @John 1 the blessed Lord is presented as the Lamb of God to the two disciples. The Lamb of God is a sacrificial title; it presents One to our hearts who comes from God to go into death, to bring the blessed testimony of what God is into the very place of sin and death. I have a strong impression that when Satan introduced sin into the world his object was not so much to destroy man as to introduce a state of things which should render it impossible for God to be known save as a righteous Judge. Satan's object is to keep the knowledge of God out of the heart of man, and thus to perpetuate that state of sin which was brought about in the first place by man giving ear to his slanderous insinuations. But what an answer God has given to all this! The very thing that seemed to make it impossible for Him to be known by man has furnished Him with an opportunity to make Himself
{78}
known in all the blessedness of His nature. He has come out to reveal Himself in supreme and sovereign love in the very place of sin and death. Hence the "only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father" -- the One who declares God perfectly -- must needs be "the Lamb of God". There is necessity for Him to wear that sacrificial title, for He came to bring the testimony of divine love into DEATH.
In the very fact that the Son of God is invested with such a title is the pledge of the entire removal of sin, and thus of the total destruction of the works of the devil in the heart of man. Everyone who is in the light of this blessed fact, that the Son of God has assumed the title of Lamb of God, must be conscious that by His doing so a divine solution of the whole question of sin was absolutely ensured, and this in the way of divine love. The very fact that He was manifested here in that character rendered the whole thing absolutely secure because of the greatness of the One who was thus manifested.
Beloved brethren, how much have we been affected by the presentation to our hearts of the Lamb of God? We are in the light of the blessed revelation of Himself; divine love has been presented to us in its supremacy and sovereignty in the fact that He has gone into death. To what extent has the truth had its divine effect upon us?
The two disciples were greatly affected by the presentation to them of the Lamb of God. They left everything to follow Him. John the Baptist was a great servant of God, but his ministry was in connection with the present order of things where sin was. There was no solution of the question of sin, and therefore no full revelation of God presented in connection with John the Baptist. But the "Lamb of God" was One who could solve the whole question of sin, and remove that question out of the way altogether, so as to be able to lead men into an
{79}
entirely new order of things, where everything should be characterised by the knowledge of God according to the blessedness of the revelation in which He has come out in His only begotten Son.
I do not say that the two disciples entered intelligently into all this at the time, but it is surely this which the Spirit of God would have us to gather from the lovely picture which He presents to us here. They followed Him to know where He dwelt, and it was everything to them to abide with Him. In figure they had left the circle of things where sin was, and they were in a new circle, where the perfect revelation of God was found, and where they could be in association with the One who was "with the Father". This is the divine effect of truth. It moved these disciples entirely out of the circle where sin was into all the blessed light of God, and into the company of Him who dwelt in the bosom of the Father.
If the Lamb of God is really before our hearts we shall be drawn away from all the pride and glory of this world, for we shall recognise it as the place of sin. But at the same time we shall be in the presence of divine love that could go even unto death to remove sin, and to reveal itself to our hearts. The divine effect of this would be to move our hearts entirely out of the present order of things. We should follow the Lamb of God through death into His own circle, where there is no trace of sin, where there is nothing to dim the shining of 'love supreme and bright'. The Lamb of God has passed into a scene where divine affections are in cloudless repose; He dwells in these affections, and He has accomplished in death the removal of sin so that we might enter that scene in association with Him for ever. He says, "Come and see"; He would have us to know the place of His abode, and if we miss this we miss the very kernel of christianity -- the crowning privilege and blessing of divine love. The whole work of
{80}
grace in our souls, the Father's activity in sovereign love, the drawings of His grace and power, are all with a view to our introduction to this blessed association with His Son.
In @John 20 everything that was involved in the title "Lamb of God" had been accomplished, and we find a company outside everything here -- a company affected and brought together by the truth. The Risen One had said, "Go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". The whole question of sin was disposed of, and consequent upon this the truth should be fully declared. And if, on the one hand, God and Father were perfectly revealed, on the other hand there was a company secured to be in the blessed light of that revelation in association with the Son of God. The divine effect of this = and this is the truth -- must be to put souls outside everything that is of man, and of the present order of things. In the upper room, with the doors shut to exclude the religious man after the flesh, the disciples had the company of Christ. The truth had had its divine effect upon them, and had brought them into a position where He could manifest Himself to them.
This is the great test for our hearts. If the truth affects us in a divine way, it must put us outside what is of man. And the truth is presented to us in a Person; it is not a mere collection of doctrines; it is presented in a Person, and that Person is the Son of God. If we are moved and affected by it -- if we are attracted by its blessedness -- we shall most surely be delivered from the influence of what obtains down here, and we shall be led into conscious association with the Son of God. This is the great privilege of the assembly. To sever us thus in spirit and affection from the present order of things, and to lead us into conscious association with the Son of God, is the divine effect of the truth.

CHRIST AS LIFTED UP AND BURIED
@John 3:14 - 16; @John 8:28; @John 12:32, 33; @John 19:38 - 42 @Colossians 2:12; @Deuteronomy 21:22,23
There is great spiritual gain in the consideration of our Lord Jesus Christ in every aspect in which Scripture presents Him to the view of faith; and the above scriptures call our attention to Him as being lifted up and being buried. The Spirit of God has linked the two thoughts together in @Deuteronomy 21:22, 23. Being hanged on a tree refers to one as "lifted up", and the thought of burial is closely connected with this.
When the Son of man spoke of being lifted up He referred to the particular manner in which He was about to die. Death by crucifixion involved being held up to view as one worthy of death, and, indeed, seen publicly as having become a curse, "for he that is hanged is a curse of God". Two of the most profound statements in Scripture are found in @Galatians 3:13 and @2 Corinthians 5:21: "Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse for us, for it is written, Cursed is every one hanged upon a tree" and "Him who knew not sin he has made sin for us". One is the great redeeming act of Christ in love to those under curse; He became a curse; the other is the wondrous act of God having in view His purpose that we should become His righteousness in Christ. The Son of man as lifted up was publicly seen to be in the place of sin and curse, but it is our peace and joy to know that He was not there on His own account at all, but in divine love on behalf of those who were under sin and death. His lifting up, as referred to in @John 3:14, was on God's part as given in love, that eternal life might be brought in and become the portion of those who were under sin and death.
{82}
The "serpent" being lifted up shows that God had in mind the original source of evil. In the lifting up of the Son of man the principle of evil which originated in the serpent was judged. It was judged in man in such a way that its judgment has become favourable towards men as a righteous ground of blessing. The serpent does not benefit by the lifting up of the Son of man, but it has become the way of infinite good to those whom he deceived and brought into transgression.
The state in which man was before God was publicly set forth in the Son of man lifted up. But this testimony comes to men in the way of grace, for the One who has been lifted up in the place of sin was there as the great manifestation of divine love. This is brought into the view of all; it comes within sight for the whole creation under heaven. Attention is called, in the lifting up, to the publicity of it; it is a great universal testimony. The object of gospel preaching is to make men see that they are concerned in this great matter.
In @John 8:28 it is "When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man, then ye shall know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself, but as the Father has taught me I speak these things". The lifting up in chapter 3 is on God's part in love; but in chapter 8 it is what men do, "When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man". Men fully exposed their own state when they put that blessed One to an open shame. He had done nothing but good. We are told that they "sought false witness against Jesus, so that they might put him to death". If they had wanted true witnesses they would have had no difficulty in finding them. They might have called Lazarus and Bartimaeus and Mary Magdalene and many cleansed lepers and once-blind men who could now see; they might have called many who had heard from His lips mighty words of healing and forgiveness. There was, indeed, the fullest testimony available that the blessed light of God revealed in
{83}
supreme grace was there, but in lifting Him up men rejected it all in a shameful way; they put Him to public dishonour. In this great and solemn act the whole state of the world, and of man's heart, has come out. But every one who took part in that act will be made to know that all He said was of the Father, and that the Father was with Him. It is most certainly true that those who put Jesus, or even His feeble representatives, in the place of shame and reproach, will be made to know what they have done.
In @John 12:32 we pass over to another side of this matter, and we see God's great design in it, and that He brings it to pass notwithstanding what is true of man. "And I, if I be lifted up out of the earth, will draw all to me". He becomes, as lifted up out of the earth, a divine centre of attraction. His death has given Him a prominence, a place of advantage in relation to men universally, which He did not have before He was lifted up. As on the earth He said, "I have not been sent save to the lost sheep of Israel's house", @Matthew 15:24, but as lifted up out of the earth He draws all to Him. The particular kind of death that He should die was designed by infinite wisdom, so that He should not die on the earth, but as lifted up out of it. It is important that, when speaking of the death of Christ, we should lay stress on the kind of death that He died. It was the death of crucifixion, so that He died as lifted up out of the earth. As in that position He was outside all limitations; He can draw all to Him. He has died in a way that was designed of God to set forth that it was the divine intent that He should come within the view of all. His death, in this sense, has given Him a wonderful elevation, so that all the ends of the earth can look unto Him and be saved, He can draw all to Him. The divine gathering centre to which all must come for blessing is not any place or person on earth, but One lifted up out of the earth. This is the blessed way which divine love has taken to draw men away from a world fully exposed as having nothing in
{84}
common with God. All the work of grace during the last two thousand years has been the drawing of men to Christ as the One lifted up. This is still the public position, and the testimony of God as announced to men.
In the light of this we can see how important the cross is as the universal testimony of God to men. Paul and John are in perfect harmony as to this. Paul came to the Corinthians announcing the testimony of God, and he said, "I did not judge it well to know anything among you save Jesus Christ, and him crucified", @1 Corinthians 2:2. The great thing in preaching is "that the cross of the Christ may not be made vain"; that is, emptied of its true meaning. There is wonderful meaning in the lifting up of Christ on the cross, and its real force is to be brought home to men. "The word of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but to us that are saved it is God's power". Christ crucified is "to Jews an offence, and to nations foolishness; but to those that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ God's power and God's wisdom", @1 Corinthians 1:23, 24. When this testimony comes to men "in demonstration of the Spirit and of power" it brings them clean out of the world. It is a testimony that can only be truly presented in spiritual power; hence Paul came to Corinth in weakness and in fear and in much trembling, not that he was afraid of the Corinthians, but he feared lest some element of human wisdom should come in to mar his service.
We gather, further, from @Deuteronomy 21:23, that one who has been publicly exposed, as become a curse, is viewed as a defilement to the land. Hence it is written, "thou shalt in any wise bury him that day ... thou shalt not defile thy land". No doubt it was as having this scripture in mind that the Jews were anxious that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath, @John 19:31. But there is divine instruction in the ordinance, and it gives the burial of the Lord an important place. As having been identified with sin and curse -- as bearing it vicariously -- the burial of the
{85}
Lord was necessary that the very condition in which He was made sin might pass completely out of sight. So long as He was exposed upon the cross what was in public evidence was One in the place of sin and curse. His death did not remove Him from that position publicly, but His burial did, and He never reappeared in the condition in which He was made sin. The condition which He had taken up as coming into holy manhood, in which He could bear sin and die, went out of sight when He was buried, and as raised from the dead He is in a new condition to which neither sin nor death could ever be attached. Viewing this matter in the light of @Deuteronomy 21:23 we can understand why the burial of Christ is included in the glad tidings which Paul preached, @1 Corinthians 15:4. The condition in which Christ was made sin went out of God's sight in His burial, and this is of immense importance when we consider all its consequences in their bearing on those who love Him. Burial is viewed in @Deuteronomy 21:23 as removing defilement from the land. When seven of Saul's descendants were hanged before Jehovah for his sin against the Gibeonites, it was when they had been buried we are told, "afterwards God was propitious to the land", @2 Samuel 21:14. The sentence having been executed, and the condition in which it was executed having been removed from God's sight in burial, the matter was righteously ended. The Christ on whom we have believed is One who has not only died, but who was also buried.
It is well to bear in mind that when the Spirit of God by Paul draws attention to Christ as descending, He does not stop short of burial. For His burial is clearly the full depth of His descent according to @Ephesians 4:9, 10. "But that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth? He that descended is the same who has also ascended up above all the heavens, that he might fill all things". Paul is led to speak of this by thinking of Him as ascended on high according to @Psalm 68:18. His having
{86}
ascended implied that He had descended, and the depth of His descent was "into the lower parts of the earth". This is in keeping with the Lord's own words, "For even as Jonas was in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights, thus shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights", @Matthew 12:40. He descended from the place that was ever His in eternal Deity not only to the cross but to the grave. He descended in the strength of His love to the lower parts of the earth; we get the full measure of His descent as we take in the thought of His burial. Mary of Bethany seems to have been the only one of His disciples who had His burial definitely in view. She was in concert with His mind in this. In anointing His body for burial she showed that the full depth of His descent in love was before her heart. But in doing it "beforehand" she made manifest that she had no thought of His remaining in the tomb. Her pound of costly ointment was put upon Him in view of His burial, but it was done "beforehand" because her heart understood that He would not be available for anointing after His death. The greatness of His divine Person was before her: if such a Person descended to burial it was impossible that He should remain there; He must, as He Himself had said, ascend up where He was before, @John 6:62. The descending and the ascending are equal, for it is the same Person who does both. In ascending up above all the heavens He went to "where he was before". But He went in a new condition, for He ascended as Man "that he might fill all things". No scripture could more clearly establish His Deity. No wonder that Mary's heart was filled as in the spirit of adoration she anointed the feet of Jesus! As regarded in the light of @Ephesians 4:9, 10, we could not think of any creature anointing His head. Adoration at the feet of such a Person is the only right attitude.
In Mark's gospel the setting of the incident is different. The woman is not named, and we are told that she had "an
{87}
alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard, very costly; and having broken the alabaster flask, she poured it out upon his head", @Mark 14:3. Our attention is called in this scripture to the vessel in which the ointment was, and to the fact that it was broken. As seen in Simon the leper's house the Lord would be viewed as known in the midst of Israel. *He* was the blessed Person in whom everything that was precious to God was found, and the woman, as divinely taught, understood that His path of service was to lead Him into death. It was what her affections had gathered up as a result of what she had seen and heard. He was God's Anointed to carry out all His will, the One in whom every promise would be fulfilled. He is viewed in Mark as the great Servant of divine pleasure, and, in keeping with a view of Him in the greatness that attached to Him officially by God's appointment, the woman poured out her ointment upon His head.
In John the vessel is not mentioned, but we are told that "Mary therefore, having taken a pound of ointment of pure nard of great price, anointed the feet of Jesus". I believe that in the setting of this gospel the Spirit of God would lead us to regard Mary herself as the vessel. She had stored up in affectionate appreciation, a wealthy knowledge of One who was so great personally that He had descended from Godhead's fullest glory that He might go down to the lower parts of the earth. He was descending to burial, and He took account of her as having kept her ointment for the day of His preparation for burial. One who could so descend must necessarily ascend up where He was before, and regarded thus in His personal greatness it is fitting that His feet should be anointed and not His head.
It is important to notice that the reference to the Lord descending into the lower parts of the earth is in the epistle to the Ephesians, for that epistle gives us the full height of things, and also the full depth. Indeed, we have the "depth and height" particularly mentioned in it, chapter 3:18. "The
{88}
lower parts of the earth" must be understood as indicating where the might of God's strength wrought in the Christ, as we read in @Ephesians 1:19, 20. The apostle prays that we may know "the surpassing greatness of his power towards us who believe, according to the working of the might of his strength, in which he wrought in the Christ in raising him from among the dead". The mighty power of God acted in those "lower parts of the earth" into which Christ had descended in love, so that His burial really took Him to the point which would witness to the fullest expression of the might of God's strength. I do not know that we have anywhere else in Scripture such an accumulation of words descriptive of divine power, and they impress upon us the greatness of the power that operated in the raising of Christ from among the dead. They give a very solemn impression of the tremendous power that is necessary to effect resurrection. The Lord being found, in infinite grace, among the dead gave occasion for that power to be exercised. His burial brought Him to that low point where the surpassing greatness of God's power could be known, and known in a way that is "towards us who believe". As buried, the Lord is viewed as having come under the whole weight of what rested on us, and the surpassing greatness of God's power came in and raised Him from that point. Love descended to that point, but the might of God's strength came in to raise Him. The love in which He descended was towards us, and the power that raised Him is towards us also. The whole matter had in view God's wondrous purposes of love in regard to us.
The resurrection of Christ is a far greater expression of divine power than creation. In creation God spake and it was done. There is no suggestion of any extraordinary exertion of divine power in creation, but the words used in @Ephesians 1:19 do suggest the exercise of extraordinary power on God's part. God would have us to ponder this. It
{89}
is necessary that He should give us the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him so that we may know this power, and understand that it is "towards us who believe". But the fact that Paul prayed for it for the saints is evidence that God is willing to give us this enlightenment.
A further result of the burial of Christ is its bearing on those who love Him. We are never to forget that He has been buried here, and that His burial was a matter that brought into activity the affections of His lovers. The world that lifted Him up was not allowed to make provision for His burial. Men did indeed appoint His grave with the wicked, but God would not allow that appointment to stand. In retaining the Lord's burial in the hands of lovers it seems as though God would say to every lover of Christ, This is a matter for you to be concerned about; how do your affections move in regard to it? We have seen how Mary's affections moved in relation to His burial, and in Joseph of Arimathaea we see one who took up publicly and wholeheartedly the position of identification with Christ in burial. This was his great privilege, but it is the privilege of all lovers of Christ, and therefore he may be regarded as representative of them all in this character. And there is special instruction in the experience of Joseph, for, though a disciple, he had not been publicly identified with the Lord before. What hindered him is the very thing that hinders us, and God would show us how he got free from his hindrance so that we might get free in the same way.
He had been "a disciple of Jesus, but secretly through fear of the Jews". There had been with him, as with us all, a shrinking from reproach and suffering, and a desire for the easy path. He had not known what it was to see the body of the flesh cut off, but I believe he had been circumcised in a spiritual sense between the time when he was a secret disciple and the time when he "demanded of Pilate that he might take the body of Jesus". In the meantime "the circumcision
{90}
of the Christ" (@Colossians 2:11), had taken place. Christ after the flesh had been cut off, and if *He* had been cut off, how could any lover of His desire to retain status as in the flesh? In the solemn hour of the death of Christ Joseph was "circumcised with circumcision not done by hand, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of the Christ", @Colossians 2:11, and he put off, in a spiritual sense, the whole body of the flesh, and with it his unbelieving fears, and his desire to retain a religious place here. He was prepared now for identification with Christ in burial. *Demanding* the body of Jesus was claiming a right to it. His love demanded the privilege of identification with Christ in connection with His burial. The tomb was Joseph's "new tomb which he had hewn in the rock" and when he put the body of Jesus in it, I think we may say that, in a spiritual sense, he put himself there, as represented in the Person of the One who had died for him. I cannot think that he was ever seen in the council again, nor that he was ever again identified with the religious doings of the priests and others who had consulted and accomplished the death of Christ. He was henceforth a buried man to all that. His going down to burial was a movement of love on his part, and it is a movement which we all have to make if we are to know the true meaning of being "buried with him in baptism".
It is evident that Joseph had had the thought of burial before him, for he had hewn out for himself a sepulchre in the rock. God had led his thoughts that way in view of the burial of Christ. His tomb was one of the things -- like the colt and the guest-chamber -- specially provided and reserved for the Lord. The sepulchre being in "the rock" suggested that the idea of burial was to have a permanent place in christianity. The Lord Himself was to be there only for three days and three nights, but the thought of burial was to be permanent, for it is an abiding truth in christianity that His lovers are buried with Him (@Romans 6:4; @Colossians 2:12). The
{91}
Ethiopian eunuch was prepared for burial with Christ, when he said, "what hinders my being baptised?" It was the demand of a good conscience (@1 Peter 3:21), in keeping with Joseph's demand to have the body of Jesus for burial. The Lord went finally out of this world by burial, and His grave is left "hewn in the rock" as a permanent spot for love to occupy, in a spiritual sense, as soon as there is a readiness to do so. Ruth said to Naomi, "where thou diest will I die, and there will I be buried". How this tests us as to whether we are really prepared to go down out of the life of this world! Paul asks the Colossians, "Why as if alive in the world do ye subject yourselves to ordinances?" They were in danger of following the injunctions and teachings of men, and entertaining religious and philosophic thoughts which all belong to this world. We descend altogether out of that area when we go down in affection to burial with Christ.
It is helpful to see the steps by which believers are led to correspondence with Christ, as "complete (or filled full) in him". Those who are filled full in Christ certainly have no need to retain, as of value, anything connected with "the body of the flesh". So that, as a second step, they can afford to accept circumcision. Then, third, they come to the truth of burial with Christ in baptism. All this being on the way to a fourth step in apprehension that "ye have been also raised with him through faith of the working of God who raised him from among the dead", @Colossians 2:9 - 12.
In the interval between the lifting up of Christ on the cross and His resurrection by the mighty power of God on the third day, it seems to me that Joseph of Arimathaea was acting spiritually in accord with the mind of God at the moment. The women, we are told in Mark's gospel, "bought aromatic spices that they might come and embalm him". Nothing could have been more unnecessary under the circumstances, or less in keeping with the great spiritual truth of the moment. The Scriptures might have assured
{92}
them that He would not see corruption, and He had spoken again and again of rising the third day. Persons are embalmed because it is expected that they will long remain in death! The great and important truth of the moment was that He was about to be seen as the Risen One. With regard to Nicodemus and his hundred pounds of myrrh and aloes, the Spirit of God is careful to tell us that it was "as it is the custom with the Jews to prepare for burial". *Their* doings, particularly as referred to in John's gospel, are not marked by spirituality. We are perhaps much more influenced than we think by customs current, or that have been current, in the religious world. But spirituality is needed for the apprehension of what is suitable to the Lord at any particular moment; affection and devotion are not sufficient. Human sentiment, even of the choicest kind, tends to obscure what is spiritual. One would desire that there might be much more devotion to the Lord with all of us who believe on Him, but also that there might be more ability to honour Him in a truly spiritual way.
Joseph brought no spices, but he "bought fine linen, and having taken him down, he swathed him in the fine linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was cut out of rock". @Mark 15:46. I have no doubt the "fine linen" represented his apprehension of the Lord Jesus as having been here in holy flesh for the accomplishment of the will of God. But the very condition in which He had been here, and in which He had accomplished all for the glory of God, was now to disappear from view in the tomb. Christ according to flesh not only died, but was buried. And when He reappeared to His own in resurrection it was in a new condition. How much we need to ponder those words of Paul: "So that we henceforth know no one according to flesh; but if even we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we know him thus no longer". @2 Corinthians 5:16. This great truth lies at the root of Christianity. The Christ in whom we are is One who, according to flesh, has died and been buried. He has been
{93}
raised in a new condition which never had, and never can have, any link with the life of the world. "So if any one be in Christ, there is a new creation". Nothing is more important for Christians to understand.
In the wisdom of God the fine linen which Joseph bought held an important place, for it became the evidence of Christ's resurrection. When John saw the linen cloths lying in the tomb we are told that "he saw and believed", @John 20:8. The very way in which the linen cloths were lying was the proof of resurrection. What he saw convinced him that the Lord would not return to the condition in which they had known Him, and in which He had been made sin and had died and been buried. The "fine linen" represented that condition -- a condition absolutely holy and perfect in every way, and divinely suitable to all that was accomplished in it, but "according" to flesh, and therefore a condition in which Christ would be known no longer. They must now look to see Him in a new condition, the First-fruits of the resurrection harvest. His burial was a necessary step on the way to this, and hence its importance in the unfolding of God's ways in Christ.

THE PURPOSE AND LOVE OF GOD
@John 3:14 - 16
Some scriptures seem to shine with such a brilliancy of grace that they arrest the attention even of the indifferent reader, delight the soul of the anxious one, and are a joy for ever to the believer's heart. Such is the scripture we have read. These verses have been called "The Bible in miniature", as long as the day of grace continues, and the Spirit of God enables evangelists of Christ to preach the gospel, these will be words whereby men shall be saved.
I wish to speak briefly of three things which are here presented very distinctly, the *purpose* of God for man's blessing, the great *necessity* which came across the divine purpose and had to be met before that purpose could be carried out and the *love* which was behind all -- which formed the purpose and met the necessity.
God has formed a purpose to have men in infinite blessing before Him. It is His purpose and pleasure that whosoever believes on His Son should not perish, but have everlasting life. Everything under the sun is of a perishable order. Death is stamped upon everything in the world, and on man himself. But it is God's pleasure to make Himself known to men in the blessedness of His nature, and thus to bring them into the knowledge and joy of that which lies altogether outside the power of death. If our hearts find their object and their joy in things under the sun we shall prove in the end, like Solomon, that all is vanity. Those things will perish from us, or we shall perish from them; all will end in perdition and death. God is not in those things, and death must come in on all the things in which God is not. But by sending His Son into the world God has placed the
{95}
knowledge of Himself within the reach of men, and this in pure grace and blessing. He has given His only begotten Son; He has not come as a creditor to claim what was due to Him, but as a giving God. All that God is in the blessedness of His nature is set forth in His Son, and all is brought near to men as a gift. Philosophers of many ages have spent long and fruitless years in the endeavour by searching to find out God. Religious men have sought to remove the distance between themselves and God by prayers, penances, and innumerable ceremonies and sacraments. But the thought that God should present Himself in all His infinite perfections to men, and that all should be a gift, confounds the human mind, while it is an endless joy and wonder to faith.
As the Son of God becomes our object and joy we pass outside the range of death. Death cannot touch or mar the blessedness of that which is set forth in Him. The revelation of God that subsists in Him is perfect and eternal, and in entering into it we enter into that which in its very nature is imperishable and eternal. We have everlasting life. And this is the great blessing which God has purposed for man. In the accomplishment of this great result divine love finds its satisfaction and rest.
But between this blessed purpose of God and its accomplishment there was a great divine necessity occasioned by the sinful state of men. Men were fallen, and lost, and under death and judgment. All this had to be taken into account. God's purpose for man's blessing could only be carried out on the ground that God undertook the settlement of every question in connection with man's sinful state. Hence the "must ... be" of @John 3:14, "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus must the Son of man be lifted up". He who "came down out of heaven" and ever was even here "in heaven" as the home and atmosphere to which His moral perfections properly belonged, must be "lifted up". God made the Son of man strong for Himself
{96}
(@Psalm 80:17) -- strong to come into the place of sin and to discharge in death the penalties which were the consequence of sin and strong to bring to an end in holy judgment the very state of man to which sin attached.
The serpent of Moses had no poison in it, but it was made like the creatures who had, and so God has sent His own Son -- holy, undefiled, and without sin -- in the likeness of sinful flesh. That Holy One has been "lifted up" as a sacrifice for sin, and thus sin in the flesh has been condemned (@Romans 8:3). He "must" be lifted up! The universe must know that God is glorious in holiness -- that He will maintain his own righteousness, and vindicate at His own cost every attribute of His Being, while He acts according to His blessed nature that He may accomplish the purpose of His love.
Thus God stands revealed. It is not only blessings that are presented, but all the blessedness of God Himself. "*He* is in the light". No clouds and thick darkness are round about Him now; His attributes are fully displayed, in all their perfection; His nature has disclosed itself. "God is love". To know Him, and Jesus Christ His sent One, is life eternal.
{97}
THE FOOD OF LIFE
@John 6:1 - 71
The Lord used the simplest figures to express the greatest and most profound thoughts of God in relation to men. "Bread" is universally known as human food, but when we think of it as given by the Father out of heaven to be life for the world it assumes a spiritual character of the deepest interest. The Father has brought into this scene of death something that is altogether new as being out of heaven, and He has brought it in that His creatures here on earth might live on it in a spiritual way.
It is quite certain that the fallen creature, if left to itself, would never desire this heavenly Bread. It is those whom the Father gives Him who come to Him; He says, "no one can come to me except the Father who has sent me draw him" (verse 44). It is not that the Father hinders anyone from coming, but the state of the fallen creature is such that he cannot come because of his own perversity. But the Father would not provide heavenly Bread without securing that there should be some who would feed upon it. He gives some to the Son and they come; He draws and He teaches; otherwise there would be none to value what is so precious in His sight.
Jesus says that the one who comes to Him will never hunger, and the one who believes on Him will never thirst (verse 35). Coming to Him implies that He is seen in His own distinctiveness as having no possible rival. No other ever came down from heaven; no other was ever the Object to whom the Father drew, and concerning whom the Father spoke; no other ever ascended up to the Father in his own personal right. We come to Him as appreciating the all-surpassing
{98}
glory which is found in Him alone. In our hearts we leave all others: we say with Peter, "Lord, to whom shall we go?" In this attitude of heart it is impossible to hunger; we are feeding upon One who infinitely surpasses every other kind of satisfaction. Believing on Him means that, as having come to Him, He is the abiding Object of our faith; we live, as Paul says, by the faith of Him. On that line we do not thirst.
If one eats of the Bread which comes down out of heaven he will not die (verse 50); he will live for ever. But with a view to this being opened to us the Lord said further, "But the bread withal which I shall give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world" (verse 51). His flesh must be given; that is, He must go into death. Those whom He would bring into life eternal were in death as to their state Godward. So He must needs give His flesh to furnish the food of life for us.
"He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has life eternal, and I will raise him up at the last day" (verse 54). He adds, "for my flesh is truly food and my blood is truly drink". We may gather from this something of the divine value of that holy flesh and blood which can now be fed upon to life eternal. It is not here the Lord's death as making atonement or propitiation to meet the holy claims of God so that we might be justified and accepted. This is the flesh and blood of the Son of man as the food of life eternal, that by which we enter into what is wholly new, and outside the whole range of sin and death. It is the result of a divine Person coming down out of heaven and entering into the condition of death so that we might feed upon Him as having come into that condition, and by so doing acquire a life which is far more blessed than any creature had before. All believers think thankfully and adoringly of what the death of Christ has removed, but we should also open our hearts to take in what it is for us as the food of life. The Son of man being found in
{99}
death is the most marvellous thing that has ever been in the universe of God.
In verse 51 the Lord speaks of giving His flesh, and in verse 53 He adds the thought of drinking His blood, and the two actions of eating His flesh and drinking His blood are spoken of three times in the following three verses. The One who came down out of heaven took part in blood and flesh. It was a sinless condition, for in it He was the Holy One of God, as Peter confessed Him in this chapter (verse 69). Indeed, the Fulness of Godhead dwelt in Him in that condition. So that there is an infinitude of meaning in His being able to say, "my flesh", "my blood". Yet it was that which He could give, so that His flesh can be eaten and His blood drunk by those given to Him by His Father. His flesh and His blood were most intimately together in the days of His flesh, and while they were together they could not be eaten or drunk by anyone. But the time came when they were separated, and the wonderful spiritual reality of the present time is that they are truly food and drink for us now, and we only have eternal life as we eat and drink them.
This connects spiritually with @1 John 4:9. "Herein as to us has been manifested the love of God, that God has sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him". The love of God would have us to live for His pleasure through the death of His Son, but for this His flesh must be eaten, His blood drunk. His flesh and His blood must be assimilated into our moral being if we are to have life in ourselves. If the Son of man gives His flesh to be eaten and His blood to be drunk it speaks of death in an entirely new way of which I believe there is no type in Scripture. It is a new starting point in the ways of God with men, intended to bring in life according to the full thought of God. It is death as the starting point of a blessedness which is wholly of God. This takes the form of food and drink for us so that we may be nourished and invigorated and caused to live in an
{100}
entirely new way. The flesh and blood of the Son of man show the length to which the love of God would go in order that we might have our part in the life in which Christ now lives as risen from among the dead, and ascended up where He was before. The eating and drinking emphasises the intensely personal nature of the appropriation -- the inwardness of it. It is Christ as in death that we feed upon, but as we feed upon Him He becomes ours in a most intimate and personal way; His death becomes ours as the God-provided way for us into participation in His life. We could only participate in His life through His death and we take this into our most inward being as before God.
On this ground we dwell in Him and He in us. But for this we must be characteristically eaters and drinkers; we must take this on as a characterising feature, and the dwelling in Him and He in us correspond. We have reached what it is to be in Christ, as Paul would say, and He is in us; we are all of one with Him. It is from Christ in that condition of death that the "much fruit" is brought forth of which He speaks in @John 12:24. The reality of this is to be assimilated into our spiritual being. We derive all from His having been in that state of death, and this is maintained in us spiritually as we eat His flesh and drink His blood; we are to continue to do so.
But if we derive life from the Son of man having been in death it is obvious that this life is altogether new and different from any life we could have naturally. It is life according to the blessed thought of the love of God. It is the life which the Son of man has as risen from among the dead. Hence we read, "He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood dwells in me and I in him" (verse 56). If we dwell in Him His place is our place; we are brought to live in the blessedness of what He is as having gone to the Father. His saints are in Him, and He is in them, the Holy Spirit giving the knowledge of this, as we read in @John 14:20. Indeed, we may be assured that it is by
{101}
the Spirit that any are able to eat the flesh or drink the blood of the Son of man. For the Lord says, "It is the Spirit which quickens, the flesh profits nothing: the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life" (verse 63).
The flesh of the Son of man and His blood are now to become, by our eating and drinking, the source of our true life. They are divine love in manifestation, but now appropriated and assimilated as the way by which that love reaches its own end. We are thus brought truly to live through and in Him. This is our abiding place; we dwell in Him; but this is only maintained as a spiritual reality as we eat and drink. His flesh and His blood must be as much our regular sustenance spiritually as our ordinary food is naturally.
{102}
SATISFACTION IN CHRIST
@John 6
(From C.A.C.¬s jottings)
The crowd in @John 6 did not see enough in the Lord to secure their faith; they wanted signs and, what was more selfish, bread to eat. But He Himself was the great sign; had they really thought of Him they would have wanted no other. I believe the craving for supernatural gifts, tongues, gifts of healing and the like, shows that the heart is not satisfied with Christ. If one is unduly occupied with the desire even for spiritual gifts or the consciousness of spiritual power in oneself which may take the form of wanting to have the consciousness of things -- in itself most desirable -- there is real danger that a subtle self may enter into this, and we may be diverted from what is infinitely precious in Christ, and occupied with what we regard as more tangible in ourselves.
{103}
DIVINE TEACHING
@John 6:44 - 46; @Ephesians 4:20 - 24; @1 John 2:26, 27
C.A.C. What led me to suggest these scriptures was the thought that we are in a time when the ministry of the truth is, by the grace of the Lord very abundant, and one has been impressed by the conviction that the great need of the saints is not that there should be an increase of spiritual wealth conveyed to us in ministry of the word, but that we should be more characterised by divine teaching; that is, by hearing the living voice of divine Persons. I cannot conceive of anything of more supreme importance and value than that. I suppose nothing would give greater stability than to come under divine teaching, because it is not an impression, however right or true, that man could make on us but the direct communication to our souls of something from divine Persons.
I suggested these scriptures because the first speaks of the Father's teaching, the second of Christ's teaching and instruction, and the third of the anointing or unction, that is, the Spirit. It is assumed in these scriptures that we know what it is to be under direct divine teaching. It is referred to in the Old Testament as a singular mark of divine favour that "all thy children shall be taught of Jehovah".
Ques. What would be the difference between this and being taught by revelation as Peter was in @Matthew 16? C.A.C. That was a blessed favour shown to Peter and it was of the same character as what we are speaking of; but there was a speciality about that as it was a distinct revelation made to Peter which was not made to anyone else. It does illustrate that the Father can speak directly to the soul. I believe that our true quality and position as in the testimony depends upon our having heard the voice of divine
{104}
Persons, so it is a matter that should appeal to and have the interest and attention of all our hearts.
In @John 6 we see that the Father gives certain persons to the Son, and the Son does not cast out any who come to Him. He received them from the Father with a view to the Father's will being carried out in the fullest extent right through to resurrection; it says several times over, "I will raise him up at the last day". The last day is not a mere dispensational reference but the thought of finality is in it. The Son receives all those the Father gives Him, He does not lose a single particle of what the Father gives Him. He carries through the Father's pleasure and sets it up in resurrection in finality. That, so to speak, is a matter between the Father and the Son. Then something else is needed; that is, those who are given by the Father to the Son need to come under divine teaching; they need to be taught of God, so that on their side they come affectionately and intelligently to the Son. The Father draws and teaches with a view to that; it is a direct action of the Father on each individual soul. This chapter indicates that the Father is the prime mover; He is the sender of the Son; He gives certain ones to the Son, and then He draws and teaches; everything has its origin in the Father. If you think of saints from this point of view there is no uncertainty, no weakness or instability about their movements. The movements of the soul in coming to Christ have nothing weak or uncertain about them. There are many instances recorded in the gospels of persons coming to Christ, and it is interesting to see the definiteness with which they come. One might wonder how they arrived at such an appreciation of Christ, such confidence in Him. They saw there was that in Him that surpassed everything that was found in the religious world. One might wonder at the definiteness of their movements if one did not know it was the Father drawing and teaching. They were drawn by irresistible force, more powerful than the force that keeps
{105}
the sun, moon and stars moving round in their orbit. There is a stability about divine drawing, and we do well to familiarise our hearts with the certainty and blessed character of it. We can see that the Father had moved in the soul of the woman of Samaria before the Lord had anything to say to her at the well. The Father was actively moving, He was seeking worshippers. He had begun, and one can marvel at the definiteness of the position the woman took up. As soon as she discerned that the Lord was a Prophet she raised the question of worship, and then she fell back on Christ as the true resource of her soul. "I know that Messias is coming, who is called Christ; when *he* comes he will tell us all things". That illustrates what I mean. If we look at that woman naturally, we see a woman outside of moral propriety; if we look at her spiritually we see a wonderful and singular example of the Father's teaching and drawing.
Ques. What about Nicodemus?
C.A.C. There is nothing more remarkable than the precision and stability of the ground that Nicodemus takes up. He says, "Thou art come a teacher from God": we know it, he says, "for none can do these signs that thou doest unless God be with him". There is a man in an impregnable position; what put him there? The Father's teaching and drawing. He got an impression from the Father before the Son had anything to say to him directly.
It is most blessed for us fully to recognize that God has introduced One into the world who is absolutely of Himself; He describes Himself here as He who is of God. We are in a world which is at a great distance from God and where there is not a trace of anything which carries divine impressions outside the circle of divine working. Into such a world God has brought a Person absolutely of Himself, a blessed Person who can look without a veil upon the face of the Father. Such is the intimacy and nearness and glory of His Person and now the Father draws to Him. The Father is putting
{106}
forth the most powerful divine action upon souls; it is put forth upon each of us individually or we should never have come to Christ.
Ques. In chapter 5 we get the voice of the Son of God; but how does that come in?
C.A.C. The Father draws to the One who is great enough to quicken out of death, so those who hear the voice of the Son of God are made to live. But before we hear the voice of the Son of God we hear the Father's voice. The Lord said, "Every one that has heard from the Father himself, and has learned of him, comes to me". There is not only drawing but teaching, learning what the Father has to say about the Son.
Ques. Would it be a joy to the Father to give any of us to know more of Christ?
C.A.C. Yes. It seems to me it is what the Father does characteristically. He would speak to us of the profound delight He has in His beloved Son. If we hear it, if the Father tells us that, the inevitable result is that we come to the One in whom the Father has such profound delight. We can afford to part company with every other man because the Father has introduced to us One -- His beloved Son -- in whom He has found His delight. Now Peter in writing his second epistle illustrates what we are speaking about; he says, "This voice *we* heard". What voice? the Father's voice. They were with the Lord on the holy mount, and they heard the voice that came from the excellent glory. It is right that we should have a spiritual conception of ourselves; what an elevation it would give to our conception if we realised that the Father's voice "uttered to him by the excellent glory" has been heard directly by us to give us instruction and teaching about His beloved Son in whom He found His delight. It is not a question of ministry, of what we can hear or read, but of the Father's voice in our souls.
Everything is seen in this gospel as the fruit of divine
{107}
operations; there is nothing whatever for God in man as fallen and lost save what is the fruit of divine operations. The greatest men of God are put in the shade in John's gospel, and every former system set up by God is put in the background. One glorious Person is supreme and surpassing, and stands out before the soul. The Father's teaching is to give us such an impression of that Person that we discard all the influences of the religious world. The religious world is the point in John's gospel; it is all discarded as, the soul comes under the teaching of the gospel.
The truth of this is presented so that we may be exercised, and also that we may understand our spiritual history; this throws a flood of light on it. We may think of our spiritual history as being affected by influences which we come under, such as preaching, teaching, the company of the brethren; but there is something far greater in our history than all these influences put together; that is the fact that we have been drawn by the Father to the Son, and directly and personally taught to know what the Son is in the estimation of His heart. We have that by divine teaching directly from the Father. That is greater than subordinate influences, however precious they may be.
Ques. Does the Father's voice come to us in the form of light?
C.A.C. I do not think that it is quite light. I cannot find a better word for it than the scriptural word "taught of God". I do not think any man could explain how it came. Paul says to the Thessalonians, "Ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another". I cannot explain how, but what is taught of God is certainly a blessed reality above everything else.
Rem. The Lord takes a quotation from the Old Testament in regard to the world to come, "They shall be all taught of God".
C.A.C. Yes. In @Isaiah 54 it refers to the world to come and what will be effected in the children of Zion. But the
{108}
Lord here brings it to the present time. We see the Father as the source of all the drawing and teaching, and then we come to the Son and do not hunger. The proof whether we have come to the Son is, Do we hunger? Have we got unsatisfied hearts? If we have, we have not come to the Son, because He says, "He that cometh to me shall never hunger". There is no unsatisfied craving and we shall have eternal life; there is to be all the preciousness of eternal life in the soul. See how great the Person is, He is great enough to do that. Some one might say, I do not know if I am satisfied like that. Well, you have an impression of that Person, that He is great enough to satisfy you; has the Father given you that impression? That is something. I can say the Father has given me the impression that Christ, His blessed Son, is great enough to satisfy me in time and through eternity. That is divine teaching as I understand it.
Now we must move on to the teaching of Christ in @Ephesians 4. "Ye have not thus learnt the Christ, if ye have heard him and been instructed in him according as the truth is in Jesus", verses 20, 21. One would call attention to the directness of it, "if ye have heard him and been instructed in him". This is addressed to the gentiles; this does not refer to hearing Him in the days of His flesh, but to hearing Him from heaven. The question might be raised with us, Do we know what it is to have heard Christ speaking directly and personally to us as the risen and heavenly One, so that under His teaching we have been instructed in Him and have learned the truth as it is in Jesus? If these things are not known to us they should be subjects of intense desire and prayer. The Lord was the Teacher when on earth; it was one of His precious titles which perhaps we do not give Him as much as we ought. He was the Teacher and Instructor and He is still; it is a precious designation of our Lord that He is the Teacher. That is not Lordship or Headship, but something a little different from either. He takes the place of
{109}
Instructor, He instructs us in the truth. None of us is instructed in the truth so as to walk practically in it until he comes under the parental instruction of Christ. Listening to lectures about the old man and the new will never help us to put off the old man and to put on the new; we learn how to do that under the instruction of Christ.
Ques. Why does He speak of Himself as the Teacher after washing their feet in @John 13?
C.A.C. I think the reason is that whatever the Lord teaches is perfectly exemplified in Himself; The service of feet washing had been exemplified in Himself. So here it is as the truth is in Jesus; how sweet a teaching that is! The Lord would teach us to see things as perfectly delineated in Himself. The truth of putting off the old man and putting on the new is perhaps the most important practical truth that the New Testament contains, and this is not learned by reading books, or even the Scriptures, but by coming under the personal instruction of Christ. I do not think any truth has power until we learn it in Jesus.
What about the old man, the character of the man who is so corrupt and abhorrent to God, and so distressing to us if we have any spiritual sensibilities at all? We learn the character of the old man in Jesus on the cross. He came under the condemnation of it all at the cross. I believe that in learning under divine instruction the lessons of the cross we get a deeper judgment of all connected with the old man than we could get in a thousand years of humiliating personal experiences.
Ques. What about Saul?
C.A.C. It must have been a revelation to him to find that this excellent and blameless man was the vilest wretch that ever trod the earth. Saul indeed learned the character of the old man that corrupts itself according to deceitful lusts. He has been rejected of God and must be discarded by us. How the truth as it is in Jesus appeals to us! If we sit down
{110}
and contemplate Jesus and see where He has been in His love and power we see the condemnation of the old man who corrupts himself. He must be rejected of God and discarded; he has been, as far as we are concerned, in the cross of Jesus. We see the truth as it is in Jesus in its absoluteness; it is not a dissolving view in Him. Practically it may be in us, the old going and the new coming -- a sort of mixed condition -- but when you think of the truth as it is in Jesus you see it in its absoluteness. The instruction of Christ would be to give us an impression of the truth as it is in Jesus. In Jesus we see every feature of the new man, truthful righteousness and holiness; we see it nowhere but in Jesus. If I want to see what is according to God I shall see it there in Jesus. It is a precious reality to hear Him and be instructed in Him, "If ye have heard him and been instructed in him according as the truth is in Jesus". He teaches it to us; there may be a thousand complications in my own experience but no complications in Jesus.
Ques. Is it similar to @Matthew 11, "Learn from me"?
C.A.C. In @Matthew 11 the Lord says, "Come to me"; that is 'Come and stand where I am in absolute subjection to the Father's sovereignty'. If you stand where He is and learn from Him who is meek and lowly in heart, you will get disentangled from all unrestful conditions, and you will find the Lord's proposal holds as good today as when He first uttered the words. We want this personal instruction of Christ. We come to the meetings and hear the brethren talk and subscribe to what they say, but in many of us the practical result is not seen. The practical result is that we see there is nothing else for it but to discard the old man and put him off. We find that the coat we once wore and were so proud of is a disgrace, a mass of filthy rags. We want a new garment altogether, the new man, all the truth of the new man as seen in Jesus. We can look around and see all the universe, we can see the heavens declaring the glory of God
{111}
and the earth the power of God. But there is a creation far greater than the physical creation, and that is the new man; he is the creation of God, he corresponds morally with God. You are to put that on. How will you do it? Who will do it? Only the man or woman who has heard Christ and been instructed in Christ and has learned the truth as it is in Jesus. Doctrine will not help us, it is divine teaching that will help us. It means that our ears are alert to the voice of divine Persons. When Christ speaks, we should say like Samuel of old, "Speak, for thy servant heareth". May we cherish such an experience as that. I have read the Bible a good deal and many books in my 50 or 60 years, but I long exceedingly to know the personal instruction of Christ and to hear His voice, which is far better than the voice of any other teacher, however great and honoured he may be. John gives us the true measure of christianity, which thing is true in Him and in you. It is only under the personal influence of Christ that any of us will be prepared to discard the old suit of clothes and put on that new and finer attire that causes us to appear according to God, and to be renewed not only outwardly but inwardly -- being renewed in the spirit of your mind. In Romans we get the mind renewed; in Ephesians we get the spirit of our minds renewed, and we need that. Many things are perfectly right in themselves but they would not do for us if the spirit of our minds were renewed. The disciples said to the Lord, "Shall we call down fire from heaven?" Their thought was quite right that the village that had rejected Christ should be judged. Their mind was right but the spirit of their mind was wrong, not in accord with Christ. We are often standing for what we think is right when the spirit of our minds is far from being in accord with Christ. I may be very strong to judge what I believe to be wrong, but is the spirit of my mind in accord with Christ about it?
Ques. Why does it say the new man is created when it refers to what is in Christ Jesus?
{112}
C.A.C. It refers to the saints as in Christ Jesus. You cannot say that Christ personally is the new man, though every feature of the new man is there. Creation is so put to show the substantive, concrete character of it; it is not a mystical idea somewhere up in the air. We are so mystical that these great statements mean very little to us. It says it is a creation to show us it is a concrete, substantive, spiritual idea. It requires all the children of fallen Adam to set forth the features of the old man; they do not come out in one or in one million; it takes all to express him. It takes all the saints in Christ as under divine instruction to express what the new man is.
Now a word about the third Scripture. It is very important that the aged, beloved disciple John casts us upon the unction as security in presence of all the efforts of the many anti-christs. He does not cast us upon the Scriptures but upon the unction which is of vital importance. The unction is closely akin to the thought of anointing; it signifies that Christ not only teaches us personally as we have been saying, but He gives us a divine unction to abide in us and carry on this work of divine teaching. Even babes are addressed as having the unction, and if we are babes we are to recognise the character of the unction we have received which in itself is true and no lie. It ever teaches us to abide in Christ the Son.
Ques. Is there a thought that those who have the unction are thereby empowered to stand here for God? C.A.C. Yes, just as the king and priest were anointed of old and thus rendered competent to fill the position in which they were set. The proper designation of the king was 'Jehovah's anointed' which indicated his competence to stand in the position in which God had set him. As having the unction we are rendered independent of human teaching; we do not need any man's teaching. Think of the wonderful character of the Teacher! Remember it is a divine
{113}
Person, the Holy Spirit of God, and this unction abides in us; we ought to be conscious of it and conscious of the teaching of the unction. There is something in every saint that is absolutely true and no he because the Spirit is there and teaches us to abide in Christ.
I should be inclined to think that in moral order the teaching comes on the line we have pursued. First the Father's teaching to come to Christ the Son, then we come under the teaching of Christ, and finally we get the gain of the unction that Christ confers. We have to have our ears attentive to the voice of divine Persons. I think the Spirit has a teaching voice; the unction teaches us. We should be more exercised about these things. We are exercised about getting ministry, which is very good, but I should like to promote the greater exercise about hearing the voice of divine Persons. I believe it would have a very effective operation in us all and we should be more marked by spirituality. I think we should cultivate the habit of retirement so that we might hear the voice of the Father, the voice of the Christ and the voice of the Unction. These things though not easy to explain are very great spiritual realities.
Ques. Is Nathaniel under the fig tree something like this?
C.A.C. I thought so. The many instances of persons who came across the Lord's path with evidences of divine teaching illustrate this. I have been bold enough to say sometimes that the most interesting part of the gospels is the unwritten part. Do you not look forward to getting beside the widow of @Luke 21 who put her two mites in the treasury? There is the unwritten part that remains to be learnt in other scenes. We find persons coming to the Lord with evident appreciation of Him and with something of a divine estimate of His worth. We get no explanation of how they arrived at it; how they did is the most interesting part -- they arrived at it under divine teaching. Every one who came to the Lord
{114}
with any appreciation of Him came as a subject of divine teaching. Divine teaching is available; it is not like something that another has but which you cannot have. Isaiah says, "All thy children shall be taught of Jehovah". That is in reference to divine teaching in connection with the new covenant; it is from the little ones to the greatest. There is something remarkably inclusive about it; whatever impression of Christ a brother or sister has, I can have, if I am interested and want it. I go further, I do not believe there is any appreciation of Christ that any of the apostles, even Paul or John, had that is not open to you or me. I do not say we shall have the public place in the testimony that they had, but as to the appreciation of Christ could that be excluded from the little ones? Never! We can all have it.

THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SON OF GOD
@John 9:1 - 41
The knowledge of the Son of God must put a distinctive mark on everyone who has it. Indeed, to contemplate the possibility of having this knowledge brings before the awakened affections of the believer a prospect which throws into the shade, not only all the idols of the earth, but also the conceptions of blessing which are most commonly cherished and pursued by christians.
The question at once arises, How does the soul reach the knowledge of the Son of God? This inquiry has been anticipated, and a divine answer to it furnished, in the chapter before us. Here we see a wonderful picture of "the works of God" (verse 3) in man, preparing him for the reception of divine light, and leading him on in a path of growing light to that which is the crown and consummation of all blessing -- the knowledge of the Son of God.
The first thing that we find here in figure is the demonstration of man's state. I have no doubt the anointing of the man's eyes with clay was a figure of the effect of the Incarnation as demonstrating the true state of man. The effect of the Son of God coming into touch with man was to make man's condition all the more palpable. There might have been some question as to his blindness before; there could be none after. Man is entirely alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in him because of the hardness of his heart (@Ephesians 4:18).
It is evident that this is a far deeper thing than any question of *guilt*, or even of *incapacity* to carry out the will of God. The natural man cannot discern or appreciate what God is, even when God presents Himself in a fulness of
{116}
grace that would meet divinely every need of his conscience and heart. It is terrible to think of man rebelling against God's authority, but it is more awful still to see that he will not have God in grace and fulness of blessing. When the Son of the Father came into this world and brought all that God was in divine grace near to man without extracting anything from man's heart but hatred, it was demonstrated for ever that man has no capacity to appreciate light -- that is, to appreciate God -- he is blind.
This being the case, it is clear that if man is to be brought to know God there must be a work of God in him and it seems to me that the nature of that work is set before us in the significant action of washing in the pool of Siloam. I have no doubt this is a figure of man coming under the application of death in his own spirit so as to be morally cleansed from everything that is of himself. All christians admit that they can only be cleansed before the eye of God by death. I mean, of course, the death of Christ. But if all that we are morally has had to be judged and set aside before God in the death of Christ, in order that we might have infinite blessing from God on the ground of what Christ is, it is certain that we shall only really enter into that blessing after death has come into our spirits upon all that we are as in the flesh. God will not bring man as in the flesh into blessing, but will entirely set him aside in judgment. God will not link the blessings of christianity with such a moral ruin as man after the flesh. Nor will He leave the subject of His grace under any misapprehension on this point. He will bring in death upon what we are as in the flesh and this not only at the cross, but in our own spirits.
God has to put every soul that He will bless through the pool of Siloam before He can bring him into the light. "Except any one be born of water and of Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God", @John 3:5. Death must be applied to all that man is morally, if he is to have any access
{117}
into an order of things which is of God. Nicodemus ought to have known this though the explicit statement of it in terms seemed to startle him. The application of water (death) is the moral setting aside of all that previously existed in man. It is death brought into a man's spirit as to all that he is as a child of Adam. Job knew something of this, and so did David, Isaiah, Daniel and other Old Testament saints. Death is that state out of which nothing comes for God. If I have realised that there is nothing in me for God, and that nothing can come out of me for God, I have been down under the water of the pool. The water of death has flowed over my spirit. This has certainly been the case with everyone who can say, "I abhor myself" and "I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, good does not dwell". Death has come in on, has been applied by God to, all that flesh is morally.
This is the divine preparation for an entirely new order of things. For the one who has realised that there is no good in himself is prepared to understand that all good must come from God -- it must be SENT. The Holy Spirit expressly calls our attention to the interpretation of Siloam as "Sent", a characteristic word of John's gospel -- the gospel which more definitely than any other takes the ground of man's utter blindness and incapacity Godward, but which unfolds in the fullest way what has been sent from God into the world in the person of His beloved Son.
I do not think any man would realise that there was no good in himself without also having a sense in his soul of God as the sovereign source of all good and blessing. The one "born of water" is also born "of Spirit", and we are told that "that which is born of the Spirit is spirit". There is thus the introduction of that which is entirely diverse from flesh, of that in which there is capability of having to say to God. A man born of the Spirit is capable of receiving light from God, and the knowledge of God becomes a great necessity to him. He has got, by the work of God in him, a new faculty of
{118}
perception; he now appreciates what comes from God -- what is sent. In a word, he has received sight.
Then spiritual formation begins. We are formed spiritually in the light of God, that is, by the revelation of God, and every element of that revelation shines in the blessed person of the Son of God. The one who is prepared by the work of God in him to appreciate what is sent from God is thus introduced into an entirely new world. He is taken into a world of divine realities, of divine revelation.
First, he is made acquainted with a divine Saviour. The first confession of the man in @John 9 was, "A man called Jesus ... ." Jesus means Saviour. This is the first great acquisition of one who is brought into the light; he has a God-provided Saviour. I remember well the first thought I had of Jesus as a Saviour *from God* -- One sent to be my Saviour. I had had questions and difficulties of various kinds, but they all melted away in the presence of this fact, that Jesus was sent by God as Saviour. This presented Him as so supremely worthy of all the confidence of my poor heart, that to believe on Him seemed the most natural thing in the world. One lost sight of all one's difficulties and perplexities in the presence of such a Saviour. I believe that if preachers would set forth the greatness, glory, and grace of the Son of God as Saviour, instead of labouring so much to meet particular difficulties of souls, people would more quickly get clear of their difficulties, and, what is more, they would begin their christian life with a divine thought of that blessed Person. I have seen a good many souls get relief and a certain measure of blessing by having their particular difficulties met, but I never saw one really brought into peace with God by this process, or distinctly and personally linked with Christ. This can only be as we take in the thought of what He is. It is not this or that difficulty that I want meeting; I am altogether lost; I must have a divine Saviour. If there is no such Person, mine is a hopeless case. If there is such a
{119}
Person, the whole case is met, and every difficulty solved for those who believe on Him. If salvation comes in from God, that very fact ensures its completeness, and puts the believer in presence of infinite divine grace and love.
Then, in answer to further interrogation, our friend of @John 9 gives evidence of having travelled another stage of his wonderful journey of light. He says, "He is a prophet". This is the second step in the knowledge of Christ; He becomes known to the believer as the Communicator of the mind of God. We must remember that in saying this the man said a great deal. There was certainly no other "prophet" in Israel at the time. The scribes and Pharisees had taken, in a way, the prophet's place, and pretended to make known the mind of God. Would this man look to *them* for divine light? No, to him Jesus is the "Prophet".
We are first taken outside man for salvation, and then for divine revelation. The saved one comes under the influence of Christ as the One by whom is communicated all the mind of God. In @Luke 10 the Samaritan sets forth what He is as Saviour, and the following verses present Him in Martha's house as the Prophet. One who had known what it was to sit at His feet and hear His word would hardly care to return to the teaching of the scribes. Indeed, the mark of one who has known the blessedness of this is perfect liberty from the influence and teaching of men. He is prepared to be an Antipas against all, (@Revelation 2:13), and to take a course entirely independent of the countenance of man.
If we stop with the knowledge of Jesus as "Saviour" we may go on with the religious world, but the recognition of Him as "Prophet" involves a clean break with every kind of religious authority here. It was at this point the line was definitely drawn between the once blind man and the Pharisees. It is as we grow in the knowledge of God that we are delivered from the religious opinions of men, and it is the Son who reveals Him.
{120}
But it is evident that we shall not enter much into what Jesus reveals as Prophet, if we have not known what it is to come under His Lordship. We must be commanded and controlled by Him. When the once blind man asks, "Do ye also wish to become his disciples?" he plainly confesses his own discipleship -- he acknowledges Jesus as Lord to him whatever He might be to them. The thought of His Lordship is that He commands the blessing of God for us, and He commands us for the blessing. The man of @John 9 had proved the blessedness of the Lordship of Christ in his own experience. Christ had commanded the blessing for him, and had commanded him for the blessing. He was in the good of the Lordship of Christ, and it is this which makes a soul bold to confess Him.
The whole vast range of divine blessing, from forgiveness of sins right on to eternal life, is at the disposal of His hand; He is the Administrator and Dispenser of it all. It is a great thing to prove that He is Lord in blessing. Many have a legal thought of the Lordship of Christ as if it was merely authority exacting submission and obedience. They make Christ a greater Moses with a more exacting claim. But Christ, as Lord, exercises authority in the way of blessing. The reason why we are not filled to overflowing with divine blessing is that we have come so little really under the Lordship of Christ. If we were more simple in the sense of grace, and gave ourselves up to Him, if I may so say, we should find that He would bring us into infinite blessing. Mary was commanded by Him, and found "the good part"; Martha was devoted to His service, but not commanded by Himself. Hence, instead of being happy, she was only conscious of the deficiency of the service.
But another stage of the journey must be travelled before the soul is fully prepared for the question, "Thou, dost thou believe on the Son of God?" And this stage is reached when the man declares, "If this man were not of
{121}
God he would be able to do nothing" (that is, nothing of such a nature as the act which was in question.) In the apprehension of this man's soul Jesus was recognised as being altogether of a divine order. He stood quite alone; there was no other to compare with Him; He was "of God".
It is an immense thing when a soul comes to the apprehension of Christ in this way, because in doing so he gets the idea of an entirely new beginning of things. Many look at Christ as coming in on the line of promises and prophecy, taking up the Old Testament links. But in John's gospel this is not at all the way in which He is presented. It is an entirely new beginning in One who comes forth from God and from the Father, One who was altogether different from John the Baptist or any prophet, the thong of whose sandal the greatest of them was not worthy to unloose. Christ is here presented to us as coming from above, and out of heaven, as being One who had not His origin in the earth, neither was He of the earth. Such a One was necessarily "above all", (@John 3:31).
The man whose history we are following clearly got a sense in his soul of an entirely new beginning of things. "Since time was, it has not been heard that any one opened the eyes of one born blind. If this man were not of God he would be able to do nothing". The very nature of that which was wrought by Him had carried the consciousness into this man's soul that everything was beginning anew, that for God there was an entirely new beginning, and for him this new order of things was all taking its character from the Person in whom it was inaugurated. It is in the apprehension of this that we come into the knowledge of Christ as Head. Of course it is as risen from the dead that He definitely takes that place, for we read that He is "the head of the body, the assembly; who is the beginning, firstborn from among the dead, that *he* might have the first place in all things", (@Colossians 1:18). But here in @John 9 we get it in picture and principle.
{122}
To this man Christ was "the beginning" and Christ had the pre-eminence; he estimated everything by its relation to Christ. The rudiments of the world, and the commandments, doctrines, and traditions of men were in full force against him. The Pharisees and the synagogue represented everything that was traditional and venerable in Israel, but what was all this to a man who realised that God was beginning everything after a new order, of which Christ was the Head and source? Such a one was not moved by the rejection and scorn of the religious leaders, though he might marvel at the blindness of their hearts. *For him* it was all clear as a sunbeam; *for him* things had begun entirely anew; he was in the conscious enjoyment of the results of this new departure in the ways of God, and everything now dated for him, not from tradition or even from prophets of old, but from the One who had given him sight. I think he presents a fine illustration of one "holding fast the Head". Consciously in blessings of an entirely new order, he was fully prepared to accept reproach and rejection at the hands of those who would maintain what was now an empty shell -- a system of things entirely given up by God. We may be sure that these religious leaders after the flesh altogether discredited themselves in the estimation of this man when they said, "we know that this man is sinful", and again "We know not whence he is". No act of wickedness could have so discredited them as having any title to set forth the mind of God. After that I do not suppose he felt it any disgrace to be cast out of the synagogue. I rather fancy he must have been better pleased to be out than in. No doubt it was a fearful revelation to him of the state of man, but he must have felt something of what the apostle expresses when he says, "We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the wicked one" (@1 John 5:19). He was perfectly conscious that the One who had opened his eyes was "of God", and in having this consciousness he
{123}
evidenced that he was "of God" himself. Such is the divine effect of the works of God. The subject of those works is constituted of the same order morally as the One who does them. He derives morally from the One who is "of God". Hence we read, "which thing is true in him and in you", @John 2:8; and again, "As the heavenly one, such also the heavenly ones", @1 Corinthians 15:48. As we increase "with the increase of God" (@Colossians 2:19) we are formed in a wholly new state, in which everything is derived from Christ.
I think we cannot consider all this without seeing that the man to whom the question was propounded, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?" was ready for it. He was ready to be conducted into the full knowledge of the blessed Person in whom everything was beginning for God. He had been travelling the path of the just, and it had been shining more and more as he went along, and now he was about to reach the "perfect day". He was ready for the presentation to his heart of all that is expressed in the name "Son of God". "Who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?" The answer to this question brings us to the very core and centre of christianity in its divine completeness of blessing.
I cannot think of attempting to set forth anything like a full or perfect answer to this question, but it seems to me that three great and absorbing features of infinite perfection are presented in the Son of God for the contemplation, satisfaction and adoration of our hearts.
In the first place, He is the object of the Father's delight and love. This is a statement which falls so often on our ears that we may have come to regard it as a spiritual commonplace. But who can measure the blessedness of that which it conveys? None but those who have been withdrawn from the whole crowd of seen things into the secret place of God's rest -- who have been taken apart in spirit from the moral deformity which thrusts itself upon our notice in every sphere and at every moment of mans activity -- can have
{124}
any idea what it is to be in presence of a perfection in which the heart of the Father finds changeless and eternal complacency. All believers, indeed, accept that there is a glory and beauty beyond compare in the Son of God, but how few are filled with absorbing desire to behold that beauty, and with the energy of a holy decision that will "seek after" this "one thing", (@Psalm 27:4.) Indeed, it is lamentable how little our *hearts* are moved by the wondrous divine thoughts which are being continually presented in one way or another to our *minds*.
"This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight". I can conceive nothing more calculated to attract the heart than this. That the Father should place within the reach of our apprehension that in which He finds eternal complacency and satisfaction is an action of His love which calls forth, surely, the deepening wonder and adoration of our hearts. To contemplate the glory of such a Person -- a glory as of an only-begotten with a father -- is one of the choicest gifts that ineffable love could bestow upon its subjects. To trace out the moral perfections which necessarily attach to such a Person, to apprehend His divine greatness, to see the motive and the manner of His every action, to appreciate the fulness of grace and truth that subsisted livingly in Him and was expressed in all His words and ways, to learn the precious and divine affections that constituted the inner life of His spirit and out of which everything flowed in holy obedience and absolute devotedness to God -- in a word, to know Him -- is the present and inexhaustible joy and delightful occupation of everyone in whom "the works of God" are perfected: that is, of those who have eyes to appreciate what is so exceedingly fair to God. The perpetual wonder is that we are not more absorbed with such perfections, and in result abstracted and alienated from the vileness and imperfection of man after the flesh and his world. The second great thought which is prominent in connection
{125}
with the Son of God is that it is in Him the Father is revealed. We see in the Son of God the perfect revelation of God as the sovereign source of good and of infinite blessing for man. The One who dwelt in the intimacy of His love -- in the bosom of the Father -- alone was competent to reveal Him in all the activity of His nature of holy love. The knowledge of God must ever be the highest blessedness of His intelligent creatures. And how much it means to us in whom evil has had its place and way! All the proper links of man as having a spirit are with God, and his true blessedness is to be *with God*. But sin has so corrupted man that what is properly characteristic of him -- viz, his spirit -- is either brought, as in false religions, under the influence of demons, or it is quite thrown into the background, so that man is simply controlled by his own selfish lusts. Through infinite grace, by the renewing of the Holy Spirit and as formed in the divine nature, we are made competent to share the portion of the saints in light, to have the knowledge of God in a far more blessed way than would have been possible in a world of innocence. For moral questions of infinite depth have been raised in connection with which all the attributes of God have come into display, and in the solution of which His nature has disclosed itself, so that the full "glory of the blessed God" may now be known by those who were in the darkness and alienation of sin. And to whom do we turn for this wondrous revelation? To the Son of God, in whom it has all come out, the Light of men, the One in whose face now shines every ray of the divine glory.
God grant that the greatness of this revelation may more affect our hearts. May we, indeed, "turn aside and see this great sight"! May we know more of what it is to behold the glory of that unveiled face!
One more thought in connection with the Son of God, and then I must conclude. He is the One in whom everything is established for God. "For the Son of God, Jesus
{126}
Christ, he who has been preached by us among you ... . did not become yea and nay, but yea is in him. For whatever promises of God there are, in him is the yea, and in him the amen, for glory to God by us". (@2 Corinthians 1:19, 20). We are sufficiently familiar, I think, with the man in whom is the nay to appreciate the contrast which is thus suggested to our hearts. We have learned in scripture and in our own experience something of the utter moral ruin and worthlessness of a man who is the constant negation of God's will and pleasure. But in the Son of God we find One of whom it can be said, "Yea is in him", and this not only as to His personal perfection, but as to the whole circle of divine pleasure and purpose. Everything has broken down in connection with man according to the flesh, but everything is established in the Son of God. The most pious and conscientious believer is the one who will have the deepest sense of his own imperfection. He will have a profound consciousness that his house is "not so before God"; and this is the necessary and divine preparation for entering into an intelligent appreciation of "an everlasting covenant, Ordered in every way and sure", according to the terms of which everything is established in another Person, who becomes "all my salvation and every desire". (@2 Samuel 23:5.) Our hearts are thus disengaged from every kind of secret wish to connect the blessing of God with ourselves as in the flesh. We are set in the presence of One in whom all is established without a shade of imperfection. This is the line of ."the works of God". His great work is to establish us in Christ in the power of a holy anointing which is divinely effective to this end.
Christ thus becomes practically everything to our hearts, all our salvation and all our desire. We delight to forget the things which are behind -- things creditable to us as in the flesh, but in which everything carried the stamp of imperfection -- and to press on after Christ. "The excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord" shines in
{127}
such divine lustre before the awakened affections, that the heart esteems all other excellence and beauty as worthless filth. "That I may gain Christ, and that I may be found in him", "to know him", become the ardent breathings of the soul, and the *one* cherished desire of the heart. Such is christianity in its true moral power. Such is the divine Person who is presented to opened eyes. "Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he".
"And he said, I believe Lord: and he did him homage". In John's Gospel believing is a matter of the affections; it is that which attaches to the divine nature. It is in the divine nature that we have capacity to know the Son of God. He becomes the object of those new and divine affections which are wrought by "the works of God" in men. It is not that we trust Him to do this or that for us, but He becomes the engrossing object of the heart's interest and affection. That is, He has His own knit to Him in ties of bridal affection. (@John 3:29.)
That but few have reached this wondrous goal of the soul's history must be sorrowfully admitted, but not less on this account does it shine before our hearts as the only adequate consummation of the present purpose of God. It is certain that all "the works of God" in human souls are to secure this great end. The Father works for it in the drawings and teachings of His gracious power. The Holy Spirit ever moves in this direction. "The servant took Rebecca and went away" (@Genesis 24:61.) We may be sure that that way led to Isaac. Of Rebecca it is said that she "followed the man". May we with the same whole-hearted decision follow our Eliezer to the true Isaac -- the Son of the Father's love! All grace and gifts and ministries are to this end, "until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God". (@Ephesians 4:13.) May God awaken and maintain in our hearts, and in the hearts of all His beloved children, a profound interest and exercise as to this great purpose of His
{128}
love! May He graciously deliver us from mean and commonplace thoughts of the scope of christian blessing! May He deliver us from what is merely doctrinal and intellectual, and engage our hearts with increasing fervour of affection with His beloved Son!
{129}
THE WORK OF GOD
@John 9:1 - 38
C.A.C. This man is viewed simply and wholly as the subject of the works of God which were to enable him to apprehend Christ, so that when he came to the knowledge of the Son of God and worshipped Him the works of God were patent.
Ques. Is it not well to see that the eyes of the Lord were set upon this blind man in the first place? "As he passed on, he saw a man blind from birth".
C.A.C. It is a question of the greatness of what has come in by God -- by the Lord in His own greatness, "before Abraham was I am". In John's gospel it is not so much the thought of meeting the state of sin but the greatness of what has come in in the person of Christ and that man should be rendered capable of apprehending and appreciating this.
Ques. Would you say this will be the normal process in every one of us?
C.A.C. I am sure of that. This man does not ask to have his eyes opened. The Lord moves from the divine side. God is pleased to come in in the fight of revelation. On man's side there is total inability to see the character of the light that is shining. The Lord referred to Himself in chapter 8 as the Light of the world. The most glorious Light that could shine was shining there. But man's state is such that he does not appreciate the light. The light may be shining but the blind man has no capacity to see it. So the giver of Light of chapter 8 has to become the giver of Sight of chapter 9.
Rem. Man's condition is just what makes him the subject of the works of God.
C.A.C. There is obedience with the man. He is in subjection to the Lord. But everything moves from the
{130}
divine side. It is good to see God operating. Every man who is subject to the works of God gets into trouble because he moves contrary to the whole course of things in this world.
The Lord's action in leaving him was intended to bring out the work of God. The work of God can be trusted. In this gospel particularly the Lord is seen as having no confidence in anything else. It is the only thing in man that can be trusted. All the advantages that we may have in an external way do not enable us to be trusted. The work of God can be trusted.
Ques. Can we hinder the work of God in us?
C.A.C. A solemn responsibility rests with us in regard to it. The only scripture which speaks of the work of God is that which speaks of the possibility of it being destroyed, showing what a serious thing it is to undervalue the work of God. It is most precious and is the most valuable thing there is in this world; we should view the brethren as the subjects of the work of God, and it should make us very careful of the influence we bring to bear upon each other, lest it has the character of being destructive of the work of God. I do not mean that the work of God could be actually destroyed.
The work of God cannot be separated from the principle of obedience; it brings that principle into action and it is characterised by the principle of obedience and by the principle of purity which is involved in the washing. The principle of purity comes out in chapter 2 and light comes out in chapter 3.
There are certain persons in chapter 1: "The Word became flesh", "but as many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God"; all such are beloved of God. That is where the gospel begins, and it ends in chapter 17 with fully matured men. The work of God has reached its full development and maturity. In chapter 17 there is a company of men given by the Father to the Son, and they can be trusted with everything that is of God.
{131}
Ques. Would Nicodemus be an example of one who is at the beginning of the work of God?
C.A.C. Yes. There is more suggested here than the initial work. The complete result is a company of people who are not of the world even as Christ is not of the world. They are in complete separation from the world and they can be entrusted with all that is of God. The Lord could say, "I have made known to them thy name", the Father's name; they were trustworthy.
Everything was coming in as sent from God; it involved the whole mediatorial position and glory of the Son of God. It was all coming in in its blessedness from God. God was not working, as it were, on old material and the capacity to appreciate His work was as much of Himself as the revelation. It is the work of God to bring us to see the greatness of it. The proper correspondence with it is the attitude of worship.
Ques. The man seems to be presented as one who goes through his exercises and reaches a most desirable end. Does it suggest the necessity for obedience and subjection on our part?
C.A.C. This man became a confessor step by step; when challenged he confessed; he witnessed a good confession. He was helped by the opposition; and if we are true to what is brought in we shall grow in heavenly grace. It is significant that he says, "If this man were not of God he would be able to do nothing". Is not that a good test? It is the simplest possible test and the most complete test there could possibly be. If we come to that, to test everything by the one test, 'Is it of God?', it would bring us into complete separation from everything that is of man.
Rem. What is of God goes back to eternity, "before Abraham was, I am", it connects you with eternity.
C.A.C. The Lord is confessed by him first as "a man called Jesus made mud and anointed mine eyes"; He told
{132}
him what to do, and then in verse 17 he says "He is a prophet"; then he says He is of God, "If this man were not of God he would be able to do nothing"; finally he believes on Him as the Son of God. The Person has become known to him.
Rem. It must have been a remarkable experience to come into such brightness of light. Has the preaching of the gospel the same in view? Paul was sent to open blind eyes and so on. Is that how the work of God is being carried on in souls today?
C.A.C. Paul's mission was to do that, he opened their, eyes. That is not exactly a sovereign act of God, but the setting before them the truth of the situation so that they might turn from darkness to light. The turning would be the result of the work of God in them. But the mission of Paul was to open their eyes. Every brother who stands up to preach stands up to open the eyes of every person who is listening.
Rem. The sovereign movement of God and the work of God develops in the soul. He speaks for himself.
C.A.C. When you come to the exercise of gift, a certain moral process goes on; exercises go on and the light of God comes out; morally the two things coalesce. The object of all gift is, "Until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God", @Ephesians 4:13. The Lord operates with that in view.
Luke shows how Christ meets every kind of need and disability that exists. It is God's favourableness to man in his actual condition. If he is sinful there is forgiveness; if he is helpless power comes in for him. Actual conditions are met. It is our business to enlighten men. This is our responsibility. We cannot actually do the works of God, but we can enlighten, and we find out where the works of God are.
The work of God is seen here as moving on from one; stage to another without any complication, and without any, failure on the part of the subject.
{133}
Jesus heard they had cast him out. It seems there was a circle of sympathy that made it known to the Lord. You would not find the man in the synagogue -- you would find him cast out.
Ques. Would you say a word on verse 6 as to the particular way in which the Lord deals with the man?
C.A.C. The Lord seems to adopt, as we might say, a strange way to open a man's eyes. I thought it was a suggestion of the condition in which the Lord was found. He had come into manhood; but what He was in Himself was there.
Ques. Does it suggest the Lord's death as the only way in which blessing can come to man?
C.A.C. I think the washing certainly would be an allusion to His death. I think the spittle carried with it the essential virtue of the Person. Though the Lord was there personally there was nothing outwardly to distinguish Him from another man, but all the value of His own blessed Person was there.
It would make the man's condition more obvious, but everything depends on the recognition that he was sent. "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam", the recognition in it of what was sent. Chapter 17 refers to the Lord as the Sent One. The great characteristic of this gospel is 'sent'. They have to recognise the greatness of what is sent.
Ques. Do you mean that the washing would involve the soul of the man recognising the need of the death of Christ? C.A.C. The need for purification on his side, but with a view to the recognition of all the greatness of what was there in the Son of God. Here was One in manhood who was the Sent One. It is His mediatorial glory. It is bound up in it. "We know that the Son of God has come". I think the man who had been blind would have said that. He could have said, "We know that the Son of God has come". I think the point of that is not merely that the Son of God has come historically, but that He has come into the consciousness of those who have received understanding. He ... "has given us
{134}
an understanding that we should know him that is true; and we are in him that is true". I think that is John's commentary on the 9th chapter of his gospel. The Person comes into our lives, that is what it means. He has come into His proper place in our appreciation and affection. The opening of the eyes means that. I believe the rabbis believed that the opening of the eyes was a mark of the Messiah. It sets forth a process which is purely divine in its character. They should have known who was there.
Rem. Some of them are made blind in this chapter. That is a solemn side of the chapter.
C.A.C. Is there that in regard of the last verse but one of the first epistle of John? That those who have understanding are able to make a confession that "He is the true God and eternal life"? He stands out alone in all His greatness and glory to those who have this sight, and He is identified with God.
Ques. How does this knowledge of God help us as to separation from the world?
C.A.C. You come into the appreciation of that which has no place in the current religions of the day. It is astonishing how little place there is for the Person of Christ in this world. The present state of things publicly is very much like the position of the ark in the days of King Saul. It was disregarded. Saul represents what is fleshly as predominating. There is no place for what is spiritual. The work of God is of no account. They do not enquire at the ark. So it is as to the glorious Person of the Christ, the Son of God; He is disregarded.
Rem. The Son of God is outside. The man was cast out. It is far more testing to be cast out than to go out. Ultimately the world will know that "thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me".
C.A.C. There is something particularly precious about this manifestation of the Lord to the man. He is the Son of
{135}
God in all His greatness as on God's side, what He is in relation to God. We all begin by thinking of what He is in relation to us, the wonderful grace in which He came down to meet us in our need, but it is a wonderful thing to get over to the divine side. We should learn to think of Him in relation to God.
Ques. Is that salvation from a judged scene according to @John 3?
C.A.C. Yes. We learn to see the place that He has with God. It is really what separates the heart from the present world in every aspect. The true mark of believing is that he did homage. No other attitude could be taken in view of the greatness of this Person.
Rem. There was no need for him to go out. They had cast him out. The compensation that the man gets as having been cast out is that the Lord makes Himself known to him as the Son of God.
C.A.C. How delightful it is to the Lord to look down upon us this afternoon and take note of the work of God in each soul. We may deceive ourselves and we may deceive one another, but the Lord takes account of the actual progress of the work of God in our souls and He values it most intensely.
We may be quite sure that all opposition and conflict and ministry is in view of the work of God in our souls.
{136}
THE FATHER'S LOVE
@John 10:17; @John 16:27
There are affections between the Father and the Son into which it is impossible for us to enter. The Father loved the Son before the world's foundation, but we cannot enter into that love. The character of the love, as well as its degree, is altogether beyond us.
But here the Lord speaks of the Father's love to Him in a way which we can, in measure, enter into. If the Father loves Him because He laid down His life that He might take it again, I think we may say with all reverence that we love Him for the same reason. We have thoughts and affections in common with the Father as to that blessed One. That those affections are very feeble and straitened in us we are fully conscious, but as far as they go we have them in common with the Father. "I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine, as the Father knows me and I know the Father", @John 10:14, 15. There is the same character of knowledge and affection between the Shepherd and the sheep as there is between the Father and the Son!
He laid down his life that we might know the love of God. We perceive divine love in His death. He has made all the Father's glory to appear. "I have glorified *thee* on the earth". That does not mean that He has added anything to the Father, but that He has brought into view all that the Father is. The Father's love and glory have come out in the most blessed way, and thus He has been glorified by the Son. He has laid down His life that all this light of love and glory might shine forth for our hearts, and the Father loves Him because of it. Can we not say that we love Him too?
Then, also, it is "because I lay down my life that I may
{137}
take it again", @John 10:17. His death is viewed as the necessary antecedent to His taking His life in resurrection. He has taken His life again in a new condition. He is now the last Adam, able to quicken us so that we participate in His life and have His Spirit. He is "the beginning, firstborn from among the dead", and has the first place in all things. He is the Firstborn among many brethren. In that character He is the Object of the Father's love, and surely of ours also. He appears before our hearts as the supremely worthy One. We gladly give Him praise and adoration.
Thus we come under the Father's love. "The Father himself has affection for you, because ye have had affection for me, and have believed that I came out from God". In both scriptures a reason is given for the Father's love. *God's* love is sovereign; it flows out of its own fulness without regard to any reason outside itself. But these blessed reasons are given for *the Father's* love towards Christ and the saints.
If we have in any measure common thoughts with the Father about Christ, we come under the Father's affection; we are in the circle of His complacency. "Bring the fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and make merry", @Luke 15:23. How blessed to be brought into that circle!
{138}
THE LORD'S SUPPER
@John 12:1 - 8
C.A.C. It was before us on a previous occasion that the effect of calling the Lord to mind as the One who gave His body and poured out His blood would be that perfect unity of mind would be found marking the assembly -- the Lord Jesus filling the mind, we might say, of the assembly; so that not only is the Lord known, but also the assembly is known in her true character, a fact which I thought was important.
We have been reminded more than once that in @Luke 22, verses 19 and 20, the "me" has its counterpart in the "you". He says, "This do in remembrance of me". He also says, "This is my body which is given for you". Thus the "me" and the "you" are Christ and the assembly in principle. I was wondering whether we had considered quite sufficiently the bringing to light of the true character of the assembly involved in the act of calling Him to mind.
Rem. There is the necessity of having our minds in unison in regard to the Lord; it brings us together.
C.A.C. Is that not a most important side of the matter? Not only does the assembly call the Lord to mind, but also manifests itself thereby in its true character as entirely occupied with Him. Well, what a moment to have once a week when the assembly becomes attractive to the Lord, so that he moves towards it! We get here that He moves towards the little company at Bethany, which may be viewed as the assembly from this point of view.
I was thinking of the Song of Songs, chapter 5. The spouse is challenged in verse 9. "What is thy beloved more than another beloved, Thou fairest among women?" And the spouse answers from verses 10 - 16. It seems to me those
{139}
verses illustrate what it is to call Him to mind. That is, He is not actually present, but He is called to mind, and in calling Him to mind she can describe Him.
It is "me". The Lord does not say, 'Do this in remembrance that Christ died for thee'. That is not the thought at all. It is not what He has done, but what He *is* -- it is Himself.
I was thinking that as the spouse speaks of Him in this way in admiration and delight, she comes to view as the undefiled one of chapter 6 verse 9. "My dove, mine un defiled, is but one; She is the only one of her mother". I think that would answer to the assembly's calling the Lord to mind, and being unified in so doing. She comes under His eye as unique, which is very precious to think of. She comes to light as undefiled. Why is she undefiled? Because her whole heart and mind are filled with Him. It is precious to think of that being realised in the assembly, even if it is only for five minutes!
So that really the Lord's supper brings the assembly to light, and I believe it is the divine way of bringing the assembly to light in this world -- bringing to light a company of persons who are unified in their thoughts of Christ. The spouse can say further on in chapter 7 verse 10, "I am my beloved's, And his desire is toward me". My impression is that that links with @John 12, that is, He came on that principle, He was not sent for. He was sent for in @John 11, but in chapter 12, He came on the principle of desire, He came to a place where He was thoroughly appreciated. Is it not an important matter that the Lord should be attracted to come, because He knows the kind of reception He will have? That is the kind of company that will attract Him; He knows He will be welcome there.
Rem. "I am coming to you".
C.A.C. I was thinking of that. He comes on that principle, as being desired, not sent for. I do not think anything
{140}
could keep Him away from a company taking the Supper and being unified by being filled with Himself. I do not think he *could* keep away. The first effect of taking the Supper and calling Him to mind would be that He would be attracted to come. The presence of the Spirit in a way provides the Lord with opportunity to come.
I think sometimes the Lord *waits*; He waits for this. He waits to see the effect which the Supper has had upon us, whether we have really been unified and whether our minds are full of Himself as calling Him to mind. He waits for that. It is very important that room should be left in the assembly for the character of things we get in @John 12. It is not God or the Father here. There is no thought of God or the Father in the matter; it is the Lord who is the Object of the service. "They made *him* a supper", and it is all in relation to Him.
Ques. Would the previous chapters enter into it? C.A.C. I think so in a very marked way. They had learnt Him on previous occasions and particularly in chapter 11. They had learnt Him as the resurrection and the life. He was unrivalled in their thoughts. So this is a scene characterised by the power of resurrection, known in His own Person. When the Lord instituted the Supper He was anticipatively beyond suffering and death in His own spirit, so He gave thanks for the loaf and the cup, recognising the accomplishment of what is spoken of in the loaf and the cup. He places the disciples beyond it in giving it to them. So here the Lord is the resurrection and the life; resurrection was there in the power of His own Person even before He died. Lazarus is here too, though he is quiescent. He did not take any part in the service. That is, the service is carried on by the feminine part of the family.
Lazarus is not active in the service of the occasion; Mary and Martha are. He represents the thought of "part with Me". He "was one of those at table with him". Of
{141}
course that thought ought always to be present at the meeting; it is not always voiced. Lazarus is not brought in on the side of making a supper for Him; the feminine side is brought in -- the *state* of the assembly -- and it indicates that side of the service.
Rem. It is a matter of affection and of what is subjective; what has been brought out in that sense, rather than what is apparent or in testimony.
C.A.C. I thought that. This service is entirely a matter of ministering to *the Lord* -- not to God or the Father, but to the Lord -- and ministering to Him in the feminine affection of the assembly; that is the prominent thought.
I think we need locally a greater apprehension of this, for we often find, when we are just beginning to have liberty in the service, that a brother gives out a hymn addressed to God and the Father, and the service is sometimes intruded upon and hindered.
Rem. This was an occasion of great value to the Lord; He came to Bethany by His own selection.
C.A.C. Yes, I think that is right. The Lord loves the appreciation of the assembly. We must be exercised that this part of the service is maintained. It seems as if we hurried away from it, but the Lord would detain us, and He would intimate to us when the moment has come to turn to the Father. It is the lack of this element that weakens the service Godward, and exposes where we are in our affections; because, if really lovers of the Lord, we should like to dwell upon Himself. "They made *him* a supper". All the previous experience of the soul and its knowledge of Christ enter into this; so that when together in assembly we can easily take on the service, because the affections proper to the service are with us; we bring those affections with us.
Rem. It is good to see Martha's over-activity adjusted here.
C.A.C. It seems to me that Martha represents the
{142}
element that would secure what is suitable in the external service of the assembly; and the inwardness, the spiritual side, is secured by Mary. We must not think, of course, that the Father is losing anything by this service; it is of the utmost delight to the Father to see it rendered. This is not depriving the Father of anything; it is providing Him with positive delight. He says, "the Father himself has affection for you, because *ye* have had affection for me". The assembly comes under the Father's affectionate regard because of it. It was Abraham's delight for Isaac to have a wife.
How this carries us away from anything formal or religious! If this is right the outward would be right, so that the assembly, marked by this service, would be in perfect order. Mary sets forth in a unique way the inwardness of the assembly in her appreciation of Christ. There is nothing like it. This pound of ointment stands alone; there is nothing in Scripture you can put beside it. She was not acting on the impulse of the moment, but she had this store in possession and could bring it out at the right moment. In the Darby Translation note we are told a peculiar word is used in regard to it, difficult to interpret and never used on any other occasion. It seems to bring out the uniqueness of it: she had gathered up a precious store; she had entered into who He was, and where He was going, in a way no one else had. None of the apostles had this pound of ointment.
Rem. She was ready to take advantage of her opportunity.
C.A.C. That is a very helpful suggestion. It should make us very alert. We need to be alert at the Supper. We ought to be more lively then than at any other time.
Ques. In intelligent affection?
C.A.C. Yes, so that this extraordinary wealth of appreciation of the assembly should come into evidence. There were types in the Old Testament like the incense and the
{143}
anointing oil, of which the ingredients were all prescribed. But there was nothing like that about Mary's pound of ointment. It represented what developed in her own affections as she had been with Him. This wonderful, intense valuation of His Person developed, so that she had a sense of the infinite divine wealth in His Person. That went to make up this wealth -- incorruptible affections, you might say. Such are the affections of the assembly normally. The assembly is capable of taking up what is set forth in Mary's act.
Rem. It is good to know exactly when to come in.
C.A.C. That is very delightful in regard to any little part that we take in the meeting. It is important in the service that every part in it should fit in.
Rem. And the place is mentioned. It says it was there, where the dead man had been.
C.A.C. And it is in the place where *His* death has been. What it must be to the Lord in the midst of a world that actually despises and rejects Him, to see a company that thinks everything of Him! We can hardly conceive the delight it must be to Him.
Rem. It is the place where death has been overcome and set aside.
C.A.C. Yes, and do not you think that Mary is *there*? He has died, and all she has to think of is His burial, and in her mind the day has arrived for His burial. It is beautiful. It shews that in spirit she is beyond His death, and only looking at His relation to this world, to be prepared by her affection for His burial. He is to disappear from the world, from man, by being buried, so that He should be known in a new relation in which He stands to the Father and to the assembly. He has not a link with the world;; He is out of it! Burial is the disappearance of Christ after the flesh, but He appears in the Father's world. The next chapter shews this; and He lives in relation to the assembly. I think all that is set forth in her preparation for His burial. How the Lord would have us
{144}
understand that He has done with this world! He has not only died but was buried, so that we may live with Him in relation to the assembly and the Father. The Lord having been buried, could not be touched after the old order at all. He could be touched in the assembly. "Handle me and see". It is to be understood spiritually, He is to be handled in all the substantial character of His new condition.
Rem. Mary anoints His feet, which speak of His pathway down here.
C.A.C. His feet now move in the assembly in a new way. "I am coming to you" signifies a movement of His feet. It is very precious to see there is a distinction in John's gospel. In the other gospels His head is anointed; here it is His feet that are anointed, that is, the full thought of His Person has come out in this gospel, so you could not think of anointing His head if you think of Him as God. But the assembly can also anoint Him. "He is head over all things to the assembly". The assembly can do that, but when it is a question of His Person it must be His feet in adoration; there could be no rising up to His head in John's gospel.
One wishes these things might affect us and come out in the service of the assembly. We pass too quickly away from the service to the Lord, to the Father; we do not give sufficient place for His service. I believe it is most important.
{145}
SERVICE GODWARD
@John 13:1; @John 14:18
C.A.C. It is not easy to suggest Scriptures comprehensive enough to cover all that relates to what we are considering but I thought we could read these two verses to start with, and work from that.
I might just say that we have been looking at matters connected with the Lord's supper. We thought of what was connected with calling Him to mind in the reading before last, and last week we were saying what the effect is upon the Lord of our calling Him to mind, which we thought was an important matter.
We referred to the @Song of Songs 5:10 - 16, beginning with the spouse saying, "My beloved ... The chiefest among ten thousand", and ending with, "... Yea, he is altogether lovely". We thought that was calling Him to mind, because He was absent. He was in her mind in all His personal excellence and beauty, surpassing all others, and we thought that was properly bound up in the calling Him to mind.
The effect in chapter 6 verse 9 is that the attitude of her mind, in calling Him to mind, brings her into view in her unique beauty under His eye. As we have said, the assembly is unified in calling Him to mind, and she is seen in her true character, and so in chapter 7, she becomes the object of His desire; and it is on that line that He came to Bethany in @John 12. He came that they might make Him a supper. It is the converse of the Lord making us a supper. The service is set forth in a feminine character. Lazarus is not active, Martha serves and Mary worships in a way that surpasses anything in Scripture, as far as I know.
I thought we might see this afternoon what follows
{146}
upon that. That is not the end of the matter. There is something even greater than that, greater than any service that we can render to Him. That is, He serves us in a way of surpassing excellence. I thought it was the service following on the supper that we might consider this afternoon for mutual help.
Ques. Would you say how the Lord's service of feet-washing is connected with that?
C.A.C. That is necessary on account of something on our side, but I was not thinking of dwelling on that particularly, as I do not know that it should have been prominent, but it comes in incidentally, on account of the need of His own. It is always necessary in order that we should have part with Him. We cannot enter into what follows in chapters 13 to 16 without having our feet washed. The Lord takes account of the fact that we are affected by the scene through which we pass, and would have us liberated to have part with Him; really to share His thoughts, and His precious thoughts are unfolded in chapters 13 to 17. If we do not share His thoughts, it seems to me, we cannot share in His service of praise.
Rem. The assembly is the only vessel that can rightly interpret the heart of Christ.
C.A.C. What He communicates must be greater than anything we can say to Him. What He says to us in Headship is of the greatest importance. It must be so when the marriage tie is in view. Whether it is Moses with Zipporah, or Isaac with Rebecca, or Boaz with Ruth, or Joseph with Asnath, or David with Abigail, or Adam with Eve -- whichever way you look at it, the communication from the Head would be the important matter.
Ques. It follows on; it is the Lord's response to those at Bethany, would you say?
C.A.C. That is exactly what I was thinking! The Lord is so affected by the attitude taken by the assembly, there is
{147}
such reciprocity of affection between Christ and the assembly -- the "ME" and the "YOU" -- that there is liberty for Him to communicate all that is in His mind.
Unless we understand this we shall not enter into His singing in the assembly! It is most significant that these chapters in John follow what describes the institution of the Supper, though John does not give us the institution of the Supper. I believe the Lord would give us spiritual impressions in these chapters. He has something to say to us after the Supper, to draw us to His side, to enable us to join Him in the way He approaches the Father. This is the first part of the communications He gives. The Head is the source; it is as getting what is in His mind and His heart that we get the gain of Headship. It is very striking that after saying all this He turns to the Father in chapter 17. There is instruction in that, shewing He will go a long way in communicating to us, but there is something more, now He is going to speak to His Father.
In these chapters the Lord has very much to say about the Father, it really would answer to His declaring the Father's Name and He would bring us into His mind that we should get spiritual impressions of what is opened out in chapters 13 to 17.
We shall never understand the assembly unless we see how the Lord was with His own, as J.N.D. and J.B.S. said. In learning how the Lord was with His own in these chapters, we get an apprehension of the character of things that belongs to the assembly. I think it was a drawing of them to His side. The key to it all was having "part with me". Part with ME is entering into what is in His heart and mind -- what He would communicate.
Rem. "I will declare thy name to my brethren" comes first.
C.A.C. "I will declare thy name to my brethren" comes necessarily before His singing praise, and all that is before us
{148}
in John is connected with making known the Father's Name. These chapters are full of the Father and the Spirit; we can see the spiritual beauty of them.
It is important to see that when He says, "I am coming to you" it is a greater thing than chapter 12. There He came to them to be served -- Martha served and Mary anointed Him. But His coming in chapter 14 is greater than that, because He comes to serve -- to minister to them. "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you". And if He comes it is to serve a condition of heart, an orphaned condition, and supply the comfort needed by the affection of the assembly, a peculiar kind of comfort derived from His presence and the ministry of His own thoughts, all is for the attuning of the instruments to praise the Father.
The first thing after the Supper is that we should serve Him. There was the supper and Martha's service and Mary's pound of ointment, all that He should be served. When He says, "I am coming to you", He comes to serve us, and chapters 13 to 17 are a real, actual, living example of how He serves His own in love. It is the service of the head, of the husband to the wife, it is a marital service. We may say we do not know much about it; the Lord will help us; let us pray about it. The Lord would delight to lead us into it and give us the intelligence of it.
Rem. "Another Comforter".
C.A.C. It is the Spirit on the line of needed support. He takes His place in service and represents Him on the line of His service for us, just as the Lord served His own in these chapters. Chapters 13 to 17 are full of His service in love for His own. Now, He says, the Comforter is coming to continue the service. I can understand now, the great importance the great servants of the Lord saw of ministering in the assembly. J.N.D., J.B.S. and F.E.R. almost invariably ministered the word in the assembly. I remember J.B.S. express astonishment if there was no word from the Lord in
{149}
the morning meeting -- ministry on the line of the Lord's service as Head to the assembly. We think we can join the Lord automatically and sing with Him, but we cannot without being served by the Lord first. Do we look at it that way? We say, we go to remember the Lord. That is not all that *I* go for!
Rem. "The head, from whom all the body, ministered to and united together by the joints and bands, increases with the increase of God", @Colossians 2: 19.
C.A.C. That exactly puts in one verse all that I had in mind. The Head ministers, with the result that the body becomes intelligent. What follows is, the word of the Christ dwelling richly in it -- in the body, so that there is wisdom to admonish one another. "In all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another". This very service is going on still. The result is, "Singing with grace in your hearts to God". Now you get the service Godward -- "Giving thanks to God the Father by him". If the assembly is to function vitally we must understand these things. If the assembly is to go on intelligently we *must* understand these things.
Ques. You mean in the sense of the assembly as one whole, so that there is freedom?
C.A.C. I thought so. It is not given to us purely as doctrine; the service of the assembly is never laid down in doctrine. If it were, all christendom would have followed it. He says, I am going to put the teaching of it in such a spiritual way that it will not be understood unless there is reciprocity and love.
We need to pick up the spiritual hints dropped. We shall not be qualified to sing with Him unless the thoughts relating to God and the Father have the place with us that they had with Him. This moment becomes a turning point in the meeting when His service to us ends, and He turns round to praise God. We have to have sharp eyes to see Him turn round. If one thinks that He is serving us when He has
{150}
turned to praise God, and another thinks that He has turned to praise God when He is serving us, we bring discord into the meeting, like trying to sing two hymns at the same time. When He turns to praise God, if we do not turn too the service is spoilt.
Ques. Is it voluntary?
C.A.C. You can join a chapel on a voluntary basis, and some have joined the brethren on a voluntary basis, but how would you get into the body on a voluntary basis? Nobody does. What we have to do is to find our place in the body; you could never think of getting out of it. We cannot come in or go out of fellowship on a voluntary basis. If any one does he is a thoroughly lawless person.
Rem. The breaking of bread is not a matter of option. C.A.C. No christian is left at liberty as to whether he will break bread or not. It is never supported or contemplated in Scripture that a believer will not eat the Lord's supper. A good many unenlightened persons think it is the Lord's supper anywhere where they have bread and a cup, but, it is not! The Lord's supper is set in the assembly of God and nowhere else, though there is a kind of imitation. How could you have two Lord's suppers in one town, you could not have it! The Lord's supper is intended to unify all the saints. If you have two companies not in fellowship with one another, claiming it, one of them at any rate is deceived. Rem. Would you say a word as to sensitiveness to the Lord's movements, what promotes it?
C.A.C. Nothing will promote it but personal acquaintance with the Lord, to know Him well enough to know when He says, "Arise, let us go hence".
Rem. John who was so intimate with Him would know. C.A.C. A man like that would know whether the Lord was speaking to them or to the Father. All the apostles would know. When He lifted up His eyes to heaven, they all knew He was speaking to the Father. There could not
{151}
properly be praise in the assembly before the resurrection, but it illustrates it. It was an entirely different attitude, and we ought to understand that and that in His position as Man He can take that place as addressing "the Father". The Lord wants us to understand what He is doing. We see the Son has taken a place in Manhood in which He can say, "My God and your God", which is a relative position, though in His Person equal with God. In the service these things should be understood, otherwise they will not be in order. Any christian would be free as to the Son praying to the Father, but no christian would think of the Father praying to the Son; it is an evident impossibility. The Son prays to the Father, He takes a place of dependence, and it belongs to the place He has taken as Man.
The Lord would draw us to His side by speaking of the communications in chapters 13 to 16 in the assembly or whenever we come together, so that we might be so served by Him that we really come to His side. We are alongside of Him; He can turn to the Father, and we can turn in company with Him to the Father.
Ques. It would be mediatorial service would you say? C.A.C. Yes, surely. Well, one can only with imperfection say these things, and the Lord can help us and I hope will, because I think the side of the Lord's service to us is little understood. It is a time when the Lord would serve us by giving us spiritual impressions, and one should covet being used by Him for it. If it were so, we should not think of saying such and such a brother gave a word, but what a word the *Lord* gave us this morning!

THE SERVICE OF THE LOVE OF CHRIST
(Brief notes of a Reading) @John 13:1 - 5; @John 17:1 - 19
C.A.C. I suggested these scriptures in connection with the Lord's priesthood because they present the service of love that He undertakes on our side; not what He brings from God to us, but the service of love on our side, and that is priesthood.
We get in these scriptures the things that mark the priest, the girdle, the breastplate, the ephod, and so on. To learn about the priest we must go to @Exodus 28 where we get God's description in type. It is taken out of type in the New Testament and seen livingly in the person of Christ. It is a Person of whom we have to learn. There is nothing difficult in christianity, though it is most profound, because nothing is difficult to affection. There are insuperable difficulties to mental powers but none to affection. To have things presented in a Person whom you love makes the most profound things simple and the greatest things accessible.
I think you get the girdle of the priest in chapter 13. There is great emphasis laid on the girdle; there is skilful workmanship in it. The idea of the girdle is liberty in service. It is delightful to think He is always girded, always ready to serve us in a priestly way. You get a sense of His love, the love with which He is girded. There is great skilfulness in His service. @Psalm 78 speaks of the skilfulness of His hands.
We think a great deal more of His coming *from* God than of His going *to* God. The great idea of the Priest is in His going *to* God. The great point in John's gospel is that we should be for God's pleasure here. In chapter 13 His service is in view of our taking up the same kind of service. We are
{153}
to do as He did. It is a priestly company taking character from Him and having part with Him.
Ques. What is the difference between the Hebrew servant in @Exodus 21 and what we get here?
C.A.C. We get the spirit of the law in the Hebrew servant, but this is the other side. The priest is one in whose hand God can put the saints so that the pleasure of God can be effected in them. He has the names on the breastplate and shoulders so that all may be sustained for God's pleasure. I think everyone here would like to be for the pleasure of God, and Christ has come as Priest on our side so that we might be for the pleasure of God. We go in and come out, and so the feet must be washed. Of old they could not approach the altar or the tent of meeting without having their feet washed. God cannot bear to see the influences of the world about His people.
Ques. How is it that, if the Lord has undertaken this blessed service, we are so little in the good of it?
C.A.C. I suppose because we do not consider Him. We have to consider Him as Lord and Priest. There is wonderful power in the consideration of Christ. He is willing to do it if we are willing to be in His hands. We perhaps are not willing to put our feet into His hands. The washing of the feet involved Peter being freed from every religious influence which had been very powerful in him. I do not think we see how He takes account of us in the value which God sets upon us. If our hearts were more awake toward God we should feel a greater need of the service of Christ. The gift of the Spirit is the fruit of the service of Christ. He supports us so that we may have everything that we need. He has borne us before God that we might have the Spirit. He has taken a place on our side, so that as understanding what is needed He has prayed to the Father that He might give us the Spirit.
The saints are looked at as precious stones in the
{154}
breastplate, set there in the unity of the testimony. It is wonderful to see how the Lord has taken up our side; He knows what the circumstances are. It is the Son consecrated for evermore on our side. He has taken it up in the full intelligence of the Son. We can see that everything on our side must be removed, so the washing comes first.
Ques. Did you say the feet-washing is connected with the Supper?
C.A.C. There is a connection with the Supper for it was at the Supper that He washed their feet. He brings His own death before us and that displaces everything in us. It is Christ Himself and that He gave Himself for us. God brings it before us first as light so that our exercises may go on the right line. If you get the light of a thing you are never happy until you get the consciousness of it. The remedy is to pray and then light becomes life. God wants us to prove what Christ is on our side -- to be the source of everything in succour, support and so on so that we are free to serve God. That is the service in John. God has a certain pleasure in man and that was displayed in Christ, but He came here that that same service might be brought out in others -- "That my joy might be fulfilled in them".
I think priesthood is dependent on sonship. For example, the king's son as son with his father is a different thought from the Prince of Wales; the latter is an added dignity -- but he is the king's son first. Priesthood is an added dignity but He ever is the Son. Sonship must be known first. One must be free in one's affections. If one has tasted sonship one would become sensitive to what would hinder. If we want to know the power of anything we must lay hold of it in Christ. God has a moral universe and He is going to fill it with certain things, and if we are brought into it it is as filled with those things. God displaces everything in us by His own thoughts in Christ. The holiest is where we come into the intelligence of all that is in God's mind. What
{155}
a holy people God's people are! There is not a human thought left; it is all displaced by Christ. It is worked out very gradually in us, but it is all brought about by the service of love which the blessed Lord is rendering to us. God looks for holiness. I need to encourage my own heart in what is in Christ. To get the good of a thing we must first get the light of it. Many of us can remember when the first light dawned upon us of seeing Him in some new character. The service goes on and the Lord sustains His own, but the comfort and joy of it is dependent upon them being in the light of it. A person may have believed in Jesus but there is no enjoyment till that soul comes into the light. I do not think God's thought is that we should have things as light without the consciousness of them. All these things are made good in us by the Spirit. God teaches us everything by Christ; every impression made on the soul is by Christ and nothing affects us so profoundly. It is wonderful to think you have One in heaven who will not let you be separated from His love by circumstances or anything. He will not let circumstances separate you from the consciousness of His love. The Lord really sustains His people; their names are on the breastplate.
You get in chapters 14 and 15 of John's gospel how the Lord supplies everything. The bells and pomegranates are in chapter 15, testimony and fruit. The effect of the seed sowing is that there might be fruit and testimony. You have the sense of what we are taken up for and there is adequate resource; Christ is the Priest. The Spirit was typified in the oil which flows down to the skirts of the garments. How can we dwell in unity except by the anointing? The Priest has shared His anointing with us and that sets aside all else. I think the saints are the borders of the garments. The Head is in heaven and the saints are so linked up with Him that He sustains them in testimony and fruitfulness. How do we know Christ is living? Because we have His Spirit. The
{156}
saints down here in life are the testimony that Christ is living. The robe of the ephod is what sustains us; it is heavenly blue. It is nice to connect the Spirit with the Priest. I do not know anything we should be more exercised about than that we should be in a priestly state.
In @John 17 we see the breastplate. All the different jewels are set in the unity of the testimony, and it is in that character that the saints are on the heart of Christ. He sustains them on His shoulders in view of circumstances and weakness, but the breastplate shows the service of Christ in relation to the testimony. We think a great deal more of the shoulder pieces than of the breastplate. He represents us because we are in His affections. Who are on the heart of Christ? You find the saints on the heart of Christ in reference to the testimony. The bells are more the ministry, a sound heard in this world that is the evidence that Christ is living. The shoulder-pieces show how He sustains us. The Lord sustains us; our names are on His shoulder. But when you come to the breastplate it is what is on the heart of Christ -- that we should really be in the unity of the testimony. All the precious stones are put together. The idea in @John 17 is that they all may be one. You get the Lord providing everything. He makes Himself known as the source of fruitfulness and testimony. He sustains in every way. There is adequate resource for what we are called to. It is not as if we were called to something unattainable. "Without me ye can do nothing"; the resource for everything is in Him. The oil goes down to the borders of the garments; that is the only way that brethren can dwell together in unity. Otherwise it is so many men and so many minds in this room as anywhere else. When you come to the breastplate you come to the testimony. He is concerned about us in regard to the testimony. All the different precious stones are put together in the breastplate; they are together in testimony, "that they may be all one". The principles were established
{157}
in the disciples first but it widens out and takes in all the saints. You can never get a right thought of the testimony if you leave one saint out; every saint is on the heart of the Priest.
Another important point is that the Urim and the Thummim are in the breastplate, the lights and perfections. I hear saints say, 'We have got such a difficulty', or, 'We have a lot of things about which we do not know what to do'. That is the time for the Urim and Thummim. The solution of every difficulty, the light and perfection of God's mind in relation to every difficulty, lies in the apprehension of what the saints are in relation to the love of Christ as in the testimony. You have the light and perfection of God's mind in apprehending what the saints are in the thought of the love of Christ. It is the breastplate of judgment; the saints are seen in the estimation of Christ and everything not in accord with that must go out. Light as to the assembly involves what the whole company is to Christ, not what one or two are; in the spiritual apprehension of this there is divine light for the darkest moment and for the greatest difficulty. You have the divine standard. Difficulties often arise because we have not patience with one another.
Rem. But they had at Corinth to remove the wicked person from amongst themselves.
C.A.C. Yes; but it never says, 'Put away from among you that precious stone'. The man at Corinth was a wicked person and it had to be proved that he was a precious stone, and when the work in him proved that he was a precious stone he had to be brought back. The saints are precious to Christ, however naughty they may be.
You deal with your brethren according to what they are in your mind. If you know how the love of Christ estimates you, that is your estimate of your brother. If you know your own place in the love of Christ that is how you view your brother or sister, and that is power in all our relations with
{158}
one another. If I am in a bad state the man that can help me is the man who knows my true value to Christ. For example, see Paul and the Corinthians; what he said about them in the beginning of 1 Corinthians was not true in *their* minds, but it was true in his mind.
{159}
LOVED UNTO THE END
@John 13:1 - 17
I have read these verses with a desire that the Lord may awaken us to the reality and greatness of the thoughts of divine love. Nothing can be sweeter than to repose in that love when it is known, and the heart is free to rest in it. The soul may have a long journey to reach it experimentally; there may be many needs and exercises to be met and removed on the way; self and the world may have to be learned; but the great end of all our exercises -- and, I may add, of all our deliverances -- is that we rest in the thoughts of divine love, and that love becomes in a very real way the portion of our hearts. If our hearts are not in the circle of divine love they have really got *nothing*, for as christians we have no portion on earth or in the world; our portion is in divine love. Thank God! it is a blessed and a satisfying portion.
The disciples had left all and followed Jesus with the kingdom in prospect. They looked for righteousness to be established here, and were much occupied with the thought of how *they* would stand in the new order of things, disputing who should be the greatest, and so on. But instead of righteousness being established here, the Righteous One was rejected; the Lord was crucified. As to this world the disciples had lost everything and gained nothing, but to compensate for this they got divine love. Many are content to have assurance of pardon and eternal security, without forsaking all to follow a rejected Christ; that is, they have not in heart and spirit broken with the world, and they do not know what it is to have a portion in divine love.
I should like, in the first place, to bring before your
{160}
hearts the statement of verse 3, "Jesus, knowing ... that he came out from God and was going to God". How much is conveyed in these simple words! What infinite and amazing facts are involved in this brief and pregnant sentence! Jesus came *from God* into a world of sin, of man's ruin, of Satan's triumph, and of God's grief and dishonour; and He has secured everything *for God*, so that He could go back *to God* as the One who has removed every hindrance to the full display and triumph of divine love. We must not expect to find that the work of the Lord Jesus is looked at in this gospel from the sinner's standpoint. That which will meet the need of a sinner's conscience must be sought elsewhere. But, beloved brethren, let us not deprive our hearts of the deepest and richest spiritual joys by thinking only of the death of the Lord Jesus as that which meets the dire necessity of our souls. Let us seek to enter into what that death was for God, and into the wondrous blessings of divine love for which it opens the way according to the counsel and purpose of the heart of God. The work of Christ is infinitely great in moral grandeur as the everlasting basis on which the purposes of divine love are secured, and it is from this point of view that it is presented to us in John's gospel. Let us turn to five scriptures which bring before us some of the things that have been secured for the satisfaction of divine love.
1. "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world", @John 1:29. In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth for His own pleasure, and pronounced them very good; but sin came in and deprived God of satisfaction in His created universe, and no reparation was, or could be, made until Jesus came as the Lamb of God to take up the whole question of sin, and to maintain all that was due to divine majesty and holiness in connection therewith; so that God, being perfectly glorified as to it, might be free to set up a "new heaven and a new earth" -- a universe of perfect bliss where no trace of sin or its effects can ever
{161}
come. The created universe of @Genesis 1 will be cleared of sin, and brought into perfect suitability to God. The Fulness of the Godhead will reconcile all things to itself, "whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens", @Colossians 1:20. And all this will be established on the everlasting basis that God has been glorified in respect of sin, and that basis will ensure its eternal stability. Here, then, at the outset we obtain a view of things too vast to comprehend. The magnitude and scope of it are beyond us, but surely the feeblest heart will rejoice to know that a world of bliss has been secured for God -- a world where divine love will have eternal satisfaction and rest -- all secured by Jesus, who will be the Centre and Sun of that universe of bliss.
2. "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep ... My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me; and I give them life eternal; and they shall never perish, and no one shall seize them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me is greater than all, and no one can seize out of the hand of my Father. I and the Father are one", @John 10:11, 27 - 30. For some years I thought that @John 10 was written to make the believer sure that eternal blessing was secured *to him*. I rejoice to know that it does this, but there is far more in it than this. The Good Shepherd laid down His life for the sheep that He might have the joy of securing them *for Himself and for the Father*. The Father and the Son wanted the sheep for Themselves, and the death of Christ is the righteous title of divine love to take possession, and to keep possession, of them. The Father and the Son wanted a company whom They might introduce to the circle of divine love, with a nature suitable to that circle, and capable of appreciating and responding to it. The right to have such a company has been secured to God by Jesus, and none of those who compose it will ever be lost. God set up man in innocence on the ground of responsibility, and lost him. But the sheep are held on the ground
{162}
of redemption; they are partakers of the divine nature, and they are secured for the satisfaction of divine love. No one can question the right of the Father and the Son to have and to hold the sheep; and if we see what it has cost the Father and the Son to secure us, it cannot fail to give us the most blessed assurance. Much may yet have to be done for us. We shall need support, preservation and discipline. If we are left here a little longer we shall need the grace, mercy, and forbearance of God in a thousand ways, but all that will be needed in the future to keep us for the Father and the Son is small compared with the stupendous cost at which divine love secured us. "Hereby we have known love, because *he* has laid down his life for us", @1 John 3:16.
3. He "prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation; and not for the nation only, but that he should also gather together into one the children of God who were scattered abroad", @John 11: 51, 52. In the company secured by divine love there can be no fleshly distinctions. It is a company in the unity of the divine nature -- "one flock". Hence the Lord prays, "that they may be all one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us, that the world may believe that thou hast sent me". @John 17: 21. The present thought of God is to have a company in the unity of the divine nature. In that company "there is no Jew nor Greek" -- no religious distinctions "no bondman nor freeman" -- no social distinctions; "no male and female" -- no natural distinctions; "for ye are all one in Christ Jesus", @Galatians 3:28.
4. "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, it abides alone; but if it die, it bears much fruit", @John 12:24. The "flock" of chapter 10, and "the children of God" of chapter 11, are evidently the same company. Now we get the additional fact presented that those who compose this company are *of Christ's order*. He has gone into death that He might become the Parent
{163}
grain of this company. He bears fruit after His kind. His death is the end of all that we were as children of Adam, that we might be in association with Him, the Risen One -- His brethren -- "all of one" with Himself, and introduced by Him to His own position and relationship with His God and Father.
5. "The only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared him", @John 1:18. "He that has seen me has seen the Father", @John 14:9. Thus far I have spoken of His death, but it is important to remember that He did not go back to God without having first perfectly revealed the Father. By doing so He exposed the true character of the world, as we read, "Now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father", @John 15:24. On the other hand, He brought the perfect revelation of the Father to those who, by divine grace, could appreciate that revelation. But think what an infinite satisfaction it was for God to have One here who could fully reveal Him. The Father delights to be appreciated, and in order for this He must be revealed, and Jesus has revealed Him. He must have been equal with the Father to do so. Even in human things I could not give perfect expression to a person's mind and character if I was not equal to that person. Keeping this in mind, it is very blessed to see *how* He revealed the Father. It was by never speaking a word or doing an act of His own will. His words were the Father's words, and the Father that dwelt in Him, He did the works. In that lowly, obedient One the Father was perfectly revealed. Every thought of the Father's heart was perfectly expressed in Him.
Now in chapter 13 everything is looked at as secured. Jesus came *from God* alone, but He has gone *to God* as the Head of a new and blessed race, and as the One who has secured everything *for God*. He is the perfect contrast to Adam the first, who came from God, and lost everything, and went to the dust. The Last Adam came from God,
{164}
secured everything *for God*, and has gone *to God* as the glorified Head of a new race brought into divine love in association with Himself, and Head of a new creation in which all the thoughts of that love will be effected and displayed for ever. For the Father has "given all things into his hands". Think of the greatness of it. Jesus stepped into the midst of all the ruin and moral chaos which sin had caused, and so secured everything for God that the Father has given *all things* into His hands. He has acquired, may we say, the right to be Head of the new creation -- to be the Centre and Sun of that universe of bliss which He has secured for God, and which He will fill with divine glory. Those far-reaching realms of light and glory are fitly inherited by Him who has put them all in suitability to divine love. In such a circle our souls are lost, dazzled, bewildered. The expanse of divine glory is too great for us. We cannot comprehend *divine greatness*; thank God! the portion of our hearts is *divine love*.
Nothing can be of greater importance for our hearts than to apprehend the meaning of the words, "Jesus, knowing that his hour had come that he should depart out of this world to the Father", @John 13: 1. His coming into the world has secured everything for God, and has brought the perfect revelation of the Father into it, but it has also proved in the fullest way the true character of the world. It is a scene of darkness, hatred, and dishonour to God. The fact that the Son of the Father has been here has demonstrated that there is nothing in the world for the Father. So that He could say, "Now is the judgment of this world", @John 12:31, and again the Holy Spirit convicts the world "of judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged", @John 16: 11. The character of the prince of this world is fully revealed, and in that revelation the whole system of which he is the Head is fully exposed. The world is controlled by, and derives its character from, one who hates the Father and the Son. There is no place in the world for the Father or the Son. This has been
{165}
fully proved; so that the world is not at all in the experimental stage so far as God is concerned. It is so with men; they are trying to improve it, and to see what they can make of it. But for God the world is a judged thing; it has been tried, proved, and fully exposed. The whole truth as to it is out. Some people say the world is getting better, and others say it is getting worse. They are both wrong. It is no better than when the Son of God was here, and it could not possibly be worse. Jesus has left it because there was nothing in it for the Father; He has left it as a scene fully exposed and judged. Many believers have not accepted this; they think the world can be improved; their hearts have not apprehended the immense fact that Jesus has left this world as a judged thing and has gone to the Father. The result is they do not enter into the precious things revealed in @John 13 to 17. If the world is not a judged thing for our hearts I am sure we shall never understand these chapters.
But if the blessed Lord has no link with the world, He has a most intimate and precious link with a certain company in the world -- the "flock" of chapter 10; the "children of God" of chapter 11; the "much fruit" of chapter 12 -- now spoken of as "his own who were in the world". His heart is bound to that company in inconceivable love; it is His peculiar treasure -- the "pearl of great value" to obtain which "he ... sold all whatever he had", @Matthew 13:46. Indeed, the consideration of all that is involved in being "his own" would carry our hearts over the whole range of divine grace, and would lead us in a wonderful way into the thoughts of divine love. The saints are His own by the Father's gift. "They were thine", says the Son, "and thou gavest them me", @John 17:6. Before time began the Father took possession of us by making us the subjects of His gracious thought and counsel, and His purpose and object in thus taking possession of us was that He might give us to the Son. In the thoughts of divine love we are of such value as to
{166}
be a suitable gift from the Father to the Son -- a gift worthy of the Giver and the Receiver. We shall be for ever the expression to the Son of the Father's love to Him. This is beyond our comprehension, but is it not precious to think of?
*His own by His choice of us*. "I have chosen you out of the world", @John 15:19. When He was here He called to Him whom He would. It was no indiscriminate or haphazard company that gathered round Him, brought together by chance of circumstance or by the decision of human will. It was a called and chosen company, and it is just as true, beloved brethren, that He has chosen *us*. He wants us for Himself; He must have us; now He has got us; we are *His own*.
*His own by redemption*. "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep", @John 10: 11. He has an indisputable right to us, for He has redeemed us, and in doing so has proved that His love was "strong as death". He could only secure us for Himself at the cost of His life, and He has laid down "his life for the sheep". There can never be such an *expression* of His love again, but the *love* that thus expressed itself remains unchanged.
*His own by moral conformity to Himself*. "They are not of the world, as I am not of the world", @John 17:16. The world is made up of "the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life", @1 John 2:16. In perfect contrast to this there was divine love, divine light, and divine lowliness in Him. He was not of the world. And as we are formed in, and grow up in, the divine nature these same things will characterize us who are "his own".
*His own in the affection of our hearts*. "The two disciples heard him speaking, and followed Jesus", @John 1:37. He had not said a word to them yet, but the raptured gaze of the Baptist had rested upon Him, and the delight of his heart had expressed itself in the involuntary exclamation,
{167}
"Behold the Lamb of God". And in simple, spontaneous affection the two went after Him -- *His own* in their affections. Again, Peter as the spokesman of the twelve says in a moment of testing, "Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast words of life eternal", @John 6:68. He had made Himself indispensable to their hearts -- He was unrivalled in their affections. There was something about them which made them precious to the Father -- "The Father himself has affection for you, because ye have had affection for me", @John 16:27. May God give us hearts like theirs!
*His own to be loved by Him*. "As the Father has loved me, I also have loved you", @John 15:9. Could anything equal this? Does it not fill the heart with unspeakable satisfaction and joy? Nothing can measure this love; no sounding-line can fathom it. If we had, like Paul, "suffered the loss of all" things here, would not His love be a sufficient compensation? Rebecca lost her own country, but she got Isaac's love. The servant could speak of "sheep and cattle, and silver and gold, and bondmen and bondwomen, and camels and asses", @Genesis 24:35. But you may depend upon it that Isaac's love was the great thing to Rebecca. We are often occupied with our blessings, but the great thing is *the love of Christ*. And his love never fails. "Having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end".
We must understand the character of the company and the character of the world in order to apprehend the meaning of @John 13. It would be a natural thing for such a company to go out of the world, as Jesus was about to do, for "his own" are in the circle of divine love, and there is nothing in the world that answers to that love. "The world knows us not, because it knew him not", @1 John 3: 1. The world was so unsuited to Him that He must needs leave it and go to the Father, yet He leaves His own in it. So that there is a company suited to divine affections and brought into the circle of those affections, and yet left "in the world". This is the position
{168}
of "his own" at the present moment. Left in the world, and yet within the circle of divine love; that is, belonging to the very circle into which Jesus has gone. He has gone to the Father; He has returned to that blessed circle of divine affections where all is suited to Him; but He has not left His own outside the circle of those affections. That circle touches the earth and holds within itself "his own" which are in the world. As to divine affections, Jesus is not in one circle and His own in another. The circle of divine and heavenly affections where the Son is with the Father touches the earth, and includes His own which are in the world. It is a circle of heavenly love, but we come within it even here.
This peculiar and blessed fact must be apprehended if we wish to understand this chapter. That is, we are within the circle of divine affections, but not yet taken out of the place where there is nothing for the Father or the Son. If we were *altogether* in the circle of divine affections, divine love could *rest* in our undisturbed blessing. But we are still in a scene, and in a condition, where there are innumerable elements at work which are of a nature contrary to those affections. And therefore so long as we are in the world divine love cannot *rest*; that love must needs consider all these contrary and hindering elements, and must *serve* in its solicitude to maintain us in the enjoyment of, and in suitability to, that heavenly circle to which we belong. Hence the service of Jesus -- so beautifully and touchingly presented to us in figure in this chapter.
Divine love considers everything -- knows what the world is -- knows what we are -- and loves to the end. It is an out-and-out love -- love in spite of everything. You may say, 'I find so many things to hinder'. Do you think you have found something the Lord overlooked? No! the Lord sees all, and knows all, and *loves to the end*. Nothing can turn that love. It was the darkest moment for the blessed Lord; He was just about to suffer; the dark clouds of that dreaded
{169}
"hour" were closing in upon Him; and yet He rose from supper and girded Himself to wash their feet. He was thinking not of Himself but of them. On the other hand, it is as "knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that he came out from God and was going to God", that He rises and girds Himself for His service of love. The greatness and glory of which He was so perfectly conscious give an inexpressible depth of meaning to this unique act of divine love. Their condition, too, perfectly known by Him, did not stay that love. He knew that one would deny Him, and all forsake Him -- the treachery of Judas and the weakness of Peter were alike before Him -- but His love retired, if we may so say, into itself, and acted altogether from itself. He "rises from supper and lays aside his garments, and having taken a linen towel he girded himself: then he pours water into the washhand basin, and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them with the linen towel with which he was girded".
That it was a service with an unknown meaning at the time we may gather from the Lord's words to Peter, "What I do thou dost not know now, but thou shalt know hereafter". This shows it was much more than an object lesson in humility; for if that had been its chief intent the force of it was never so apparent as at the moment. We are constrained to look for a wider meaning and a deeper significance than this in the action of the Lord. And, indeed, He gives us the key to it when, in answer to Peter's objection, He says, "Unless I wash thee, thou hast not part with me". Solemn and impressive words. May their force and meaning come home to our hearts with divine power.
I must again remind you of the fact that, although we belong to the circle of divine love, we are still "in the world". The Lord is altogether in the circle of divine love -- He has gone to the Father -- and as our hearts enter into that circle we have part with Him. But here is another solemn disclosure
{170}
of the nature of the world, and of the true character of all its influences; a solemn warning, too, as to our susceptibility to those influences, and as to the condition in which we remain while "in the world". We are entitled to be in the circle of divine love; divine grace has called us into it; and as being partakers of the divine nature we are of that circle; we are of it as belonging to the Father and the Son; and yet it is not less true that the blessed Lord says to each one of us, "Unless I wash thee, thou hast not part with me". There is an absolute necessity for this service of love to maintain our hearts in freedom from the influences of the world, and in such superiority to all that is incidental to our present condition, that in heart and spirit we may really enter the circle of divine affections, and have part with Him who has gone to the Father. We are in a condition that renders this service necessary. There is that in us to which the dust of the world sticks, if I may be allowed to express it thus simply. In the case of our blessed Lord there was nothing to which the dust of the world could adhere. He was altogether the Holy One of God, and all the influences and tendencies of this world were repelled from Him by the absolute holiness and purity of His Person. There was no moral point of contact between Him and the world, though He passed through it in lowly and perfect grace. We are not only in the world as to our bodily condition, but there is that in us which affords a point of moral contact with the world. There is that in us to which the dust of the world can adhere. Our blessed Lord did not need to have His feet washed, but we do. Our condition renders us susceptible to the influences of the world. It is not that we sin, but we are affected by things here; they have a tendency to occupy our hearts, and to influence us in such a way that we are taken out of the enjoyment of that circle of divine affections into which Jesus has gone, and to which, through infinite grace, we belong. So far from the defilement of @John 13 being
{171}
actual failure or sin, I believe the most spiritual person is the one who will most appreciate this service of love -- he is the one who will have the deepest sense of the need of having his feet washed. It would be a sad thing to suppose -- and certainly Scripture does not assert -- that there is absolute necessity for a believer to commit sin. But there is absolute *necessity* for the feet-washing in order to have part with Christ, and hence the defilement which that washing removes is unavoidable so long as we are "in the world".
But let us follow the instruction of the chapter a little further. Peter, looking upon the scene in a natural way, had first of all refused to allow the Lord to wash his feet; but on hearing that the washing was with a view to having part with Him, he exclaims with his usual fervency of spirit, "Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head". This gives occasion to the Lord to make the important statement of verse 10, "He that is washed all over needs not to wash save his feet, but is wholly clean". It is evident that the figure used is that of a person who has bathed, and in walking from the bath has defiled his feet with the dust of the floor. He does not need to return to the bath; he only requires that his feet should be washed, to be "wholly clean".
Let us seek, in the first place, to understand what is meant by "he that is washed". It has sometimes been taken as the cleansing of the blood, but this has no warrant in the scripture. It is expressly cleansing *by water*, and where we find this in Scripture it seems to me to be a figure of passing into a wholly new order of things, and of being made suitable for it. The priests were washed in the day of their consecration (@Exodus 29:4.) It was a ceremony indicative of the fact that they were set apart for this special service; it was their introduction to a new order of life and was expressive of the fact that they were introduced to it in a way that rendered them suitable for it. Scripture speaks of the "washing of regeneration" (@Titus 3:5), where the thought is evidently
{172}
that of introduction to a totally new order of things; and Paul says to the Corinthians, "ye have been washed" -- enforcing thereby the fact that they had been brought out of everything that constituted their former life. Now, how had the disciples been "washed"? May we not learn something as to it from @John 15:3? "Ye are already clean by reason of the word which I have spoken to you". The word of Christ had wrought in power in their hearts, and they had been introduced by it to an entirely new order of things. No doubt the new birth is essential to this, and the "washing" involves the thought of the death of Christ; and is, so to speak, the application of His death as that which separates us from the world and from ourselves as in the flesh; but it evidently includes the knowledge of Christ by His word. "Ye are already clean by reason of the word which I have spoken to you". Christ had *made Himself known*, by His word, in the hearts of the disciples. His word expressed *Himself*, and the knowledge of Himself had freed their hearts from everything that was of the world. It was a great thing for a few fishermen to be found in complete superiority to all the political, social, and religious influences that were around them. They were delivered from the whole current of things and opinions that prevailed in the world. They were brought outside it all -- morally purified from it all -- by the knowledge of Christ. "To whom shall we go? thou hast words of life eternal" are words which express the heart-feelings of the company thus "washed" and "clean". They had, if I may so say, the moral cleansing of a new object. The knowledge of that blessed Person had delivered them from the thoughts of men, and from the motives and principles of the world. The 'expulsive power' of the knowledge of Christ had displaced other things, and by the knowledge of Him they entered into an entirely new world. They were "washed".
"He that is washed all over needs not to wash save his feet". The cleansing of the whole moral being, in the way of
{173}
which I have spoken, is a divine operation that is never repeated, but there is continual need for the feet to be washed. It is the point of contact with this present scene which is the point of danger, and we cannot avoid this so long as we are in the world. The very thought of this may well move our affections deeply when we consider that it necessitates the untiring and devoted service of the One who loves "unto the end". It furnishes Him with opportunity to give continual expression to His love. But for this ministry of divine love our contact with the world, and our susceptibility to the influences of this present scene, would have the effect of permanently withdrawing our hearts from *part with Christ* in the circle of divine affections. Little do we know how the blessed Lord longs to have our hearts in company with Himself in that wondrous circle. May He be graciously pleased to draw us near to Himself, and give our hearts a deeper sense of His love.
The question may be asked, '*How* does the Lord wash our feet?' I cannot say much about it, but it seems to me that the washing of the feet partakes of the same nature as the washing all over. It is of the same character, though with a more limited range according to the present need. I believe our feet are washed by a fresh presentation of Christ to our affections. He brings Himself and His love before our hearts, and thus He displaces the dust of the world. It is a distinct service -- the special service of His love while we are in the world. If our hearts are really touched by this I am sure we shall count more upon the Lord for His service, and we shall look more to Him for it. No doubt this service of love is for all "his own", but we ought to be exercised as to whether we have been in a condition to get the good of it. One must be consciously of "his own", and have the world as a judged thing, before he can realize the good of this precious service of divine love. There must also be a response -- a looking for the service. I am afraid we are
{174}
often like Peter; we will not allow the Lord to wash our feet. We give Him no opportunity of doing so. Do we not often read the Word and pray without turning *to the Lord* for His present and personal ministry of love?
Christ loves His own which are in the world, and He washes their feet. If we have part with Him we shall love His own, and we shall wash their feet. Those who taste the joys of that circle of divine affections cannot help longing that others should have their feet cleansed from the dust of the world, that they might enjoy their true portion according to the thoughts of divine love. It is as our own feet are washed that we become instrumental in washing the feet of our brethren. If my feet are not washed my heart is more or less under the power and influence of things here, and if I speak of these things I put a little more dust on my brother's feet. But if my feet have been washed the love of Christ and of the Father are known in my heart -- I am in the circle of divine affections -- and I naturally speak of the things that are in that circle. If I am enabled to bring these things before my brother's heart I wash his feet. It is not by telling him of his faults that I wash his feet. If he has sinned, or been overtaken in a fault, I must go to other scriptures to know how to treat him. This chapter does not suppose any actual sin or fault, though I am convinced that if our feet are not washed we are in the greatest danger of falling into sin; if the dust accumulates on our feet it will undoubtedly result in sin. We must know the thoughts of divine love to understand this precious service of Christ; and I shall be thankful if the Lord uses His word tonight to lead us a little more into those thoughts.
{175}
SPIRITUAL CONDITIONS MARKING THE TESTIMONY IN THE ABSENCE OF CHRIST
@John 13:3 - 5, 14, 15; @John 14:6 - 18
As we had before us on a previous occasion, Luke gives us the character of what presented itself to the Lord's mind immediately after the institution of the Supper, before going on to the Mount of Olives. The Lord evidently had before Him the actual conditions of difficulty through which His testimony would have to make its way before the kingdom of God was come. So we get in Luke's gospel the treachery of Judas, the desire to be greatest on the part of the disciples and Satan's desire to sift them as wheat. Conditions similar to these the Lord Himself had to meet in His own path of service, so He refers to "my temptations". He had known what it was to face *all* temptations, and so the disciples would see how He overcame. Hence the need for a sword.
John's gospel gives us another aspect of things altogether. Between the Supper and the Mount of Olives there is given the great unfolding of divine thoughts we get in chapters 13 to 17. The Lord indicates the spiritual conditions that He has set up and which were to mark the testimony during His absence. They would bring the saints out in a character that would provoke the hatred of the world.
We find that there is a clean company amongst whom the service of love is carried on. Then the knowledge of the Father, the presence of the Comforter, the Lord Himself coming to His own, manifesting Himself to faithful lovers, and everything necessary to sustain the testimony can be got by simply asking. These are great spiritual realities; they
{176}
take no account of the saints as having the flesh in them. There is no reference but to what is the product of the work of God. We have to learn to keep our thoughts on the spiritual line. It requires the competency to act as the Lord Himself acted; none but spiritual persons could do that. The Lord inaugurates a service of love in a clean company, which is to persist so long as the Lord is absent. We must understand that the saints are a clean company, and that the conditions in which they are are the result of the death of Christ and the work of God in them. So clean are they that they need only their feet washed. They must have their feet washed not because they are defiled, no thought of sin or moral defilement, but because they are so clean that by contact with the world, if they put their feet down ever so lightly in it, they pick up some of the dust. The very cleanness produces a sensitiveness so that every contact tends to remove something of the spiritual.
We are absolutely separate from it all in the power of the death of Christ; we are as clean as that. Yet we come into contact with that which tends to take us away from the blessed sense of the spiritual conditions that the washing has established. So it is that the Lord, conscious of His greatness, undertakes such a service amongst His saints so that they have part with Him. It is a spiritual condition attaching to the testimony; there could be no testimony without it. It is all exemplified in Himself as the Teacher; so He says "Learn from me".
The Supper stands in relation to all these spiritual conditions. We understand the necessity for this feet washing, and if *I* feel the need, *all* the brethren need it, and we lay ourselves out to promote it. All our intercourse with one another should tend to have that character and not be merely social or friendly. It is a spiritual condition that is to abide. The Lord says, "Love one another as I have loved you"; it is serving love. "First love" is to love one another as
{177}
Christ has loved us, and it was from this that they had got away at Ephesus. It is a perpetual service of love until we leave this world altogether.
Peter did not understand that he was clean, because he wanted his hands and head washed, but the Lord explains that he is clean. "He that is washed all over needs not to wash save his feet, but is wholly clean". We shall not understand what feet washing is unless we understand that we are clean through the word which Christ has spoken to us. The word brings in what is wholly of God. All through the gospel of John the saints are viewed as identified with what they believe. That is the nature of their cleanness -- "clean by reason of the word which I have spoken to you". The linen towel suggests that the operation is complete; the saint is left absolutely happy and undistracted in the presence of the spiritual.
The second great thought the Lord speaks of is the knowledge of the Father. This is a great spiritual condition that marks the testimony, that the saints have the knowledge of the Father. If we are set in movement by the service of love the traitor goes out and there are conditions established in which we can come to the Father. This really enters into our having part with Christ. Our place is with Christ but then He is with the Father. The Father's house will not be attractive to any who do not know the Father. Philip shows that the disciples had not entered into the real spiritual force of it. It is another thing to see the Father in Christ, greater than all the promises of God which they had believed. The Lord has all the springs of His being in the Father; He could say, "I am in the Father". The knowledge of the Father really comes out over against present conditions. This would give character not only to the testimony but to the worship; to know the Father is a wonderful spring of worship in the soul. God is pleased to be known as the Father. It is the name of revelation. Those who saw Jesus saw the Father. There was
{178}
a blessed Man in the world who was in the Father; the Father was the source of every thought, every affection, and the Father was in Him for revelation, so He spoke, "The words which *I* speak to you I do not speak from myself, but the Father who abides in me, *he* does the works".
We know God as the Father revealed in the Son and we come to the Father by Him. It is all mediatorial, not direct knowledge, but is revealed in Jesus, in the Son. So the works are to be pondered because they are the Father's works. Nothing was seen or heard from Him that was not of the Father. All was expressed in a divine Person become Man for the very purpose that the Father might be revealed. So now He could say, "They have both seen and hated both me and my Father", @John 15:24. They all saw the Father.
Now we get spiritual conditions in which the Father is known by the words and by the works. He says, "Believe me for the works¬ sake". What works these were! The turning the water into wine was the *Father's* work; the raising of the nobleman's son was the *Father's* work; the healing of the impotent man was the *Father's* work; the feeding of the multitude was the *Father's* work; the opening of the eyes of the blind was the *Father's* work; the raising of Lazarus was the *Father's* work. The revelation of the Father, how wonderful! It is the Father showing that none of these things, these conditions, have any part in His mind as to man. What marks men is disappointment, sorrow, death, and dearth. The Father says, 'Nothing of this will do for Me; I cannot have any of these things'. The Father revealed in the Son is the answer to what came in in Eden, as removing every condition contrary to Himself. That is the Father, in pure grace. Not only is He merciful and compassionate, but He comes out in His beloved Son to show that these things are entirely contrary to His mind; there is not a trace of them in His thought, We only know the Father in the conditions in which He has come in the greatness of His love.
{179}
"Emmanuel" is God coming in to fulfil all His promises, but there is something greater. It is Himself come to light as the Father revealed in the Son. The Father is greater than all He gives, and the wonderful works are the inlet for us into what He is, so there is no other way in which we can arrive at what He is. So when He describes the eternal conditions in @Revelation 21 He does not tell what is there, but what is not there. That is how we arrive at things from our side. The Revelation takes account of what exists on our side. The mediatorial system is this. If God as Jehovah had secured the affections of His people, how much more when He comes out as Father in the Son! So we get the impression that the Father has another system of things altogether before Him, where there is no trace of former things. It is the real knowledge of God revealed in these wonderful works and words. It is important to think of these works as the Father's works and the words as the Father's words; it is real spiritual knowledge.
Then the Lord says, "The works which I do shall he do also"; that is, that every believer is to do the Father's works. It is the revelation of what the Father is perpetuated in the saints. So He says, "He shall do greater works than these, because I go to the Father". What the Lord did which the people saw were material works; the greater works are spiritual works. The saints do in a spiritual way what He did in a material way. Things are to be done spiritually and are thus greater than the material things. It is bringing out the Father and so continues the revelation. The things are now done spiritually, and the Lord in doing them had a spiritual thought in His mind. So we ask what was in the Father's mind when He did these things.
There are the further spiritual conditions introduced by the Son of God in having gone to the Father. So we have the Comforter, a divine Person come in to take His place beside us, who identifies Himself with us.
{180}
The Lord also refers to asking. He says, "Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, this will I do". He makes everything available on the principle of asking; this is a further great spiritual condition. The asking here supposes that we are intelligent. We understand that we are a clean company engaged in washing one another's feet, we know the Father, we have the Comforter with us, and we realise the necessity of asking. It is all so simple!
These are the greatest realities in the universe, but they are spiritual realities. They lie outside the confines of the human mind and desires, but they are all available on the line of asking.
{181}
SERVING LOVE AND COMPLACENT LOVE
@John 13:34, 35; @John 15:9 - 21
These scriptures give us a true character and meaning of first love. We have often been told that the point of departure is the point of recovery, and it may be helpful, and an exercise to us, to look at these scriptures as giving the character of first love; that is the love which was set in motion by the Son of God in His own.
We have a very poor idea of christianity -- of the wonderful character of things set in motion in human hearts by the Son of God. There was never anything like it in the world before. The Lord says to the church in Ephesus, "Thou hast left thy first love. Remember therefore whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works", @Revelation 2:4, 5. He calls the church back to the point of departure. Now at the very end it is most important to be recalled to the point of departure.
Perfect love has been seen and known in a Man. I do not mean exactly the love of God, but divine love in a Man. Something quite new was brought into Manhood in the Person of the Son of God that it might become the vital spring in human hearts. Divine love was here livingly in a Man, the Son of God, and He came here in order to make it a living spring in human hearts so that there might be a living witness of Christ and of God in this world, and that is vital christianity. If we think of all that is connected with church order, the very kernel of 1 Corinthians is chapter 13. No part of that order was merely an arbitrary rule; it was all the expression of the wisdom of divine love for the safeguarding and development of holy affections in the saints. We are apt to overlook that 1 Corinthians was written by *two* men; "Paul, a called apostle ... and Sosthenes the
{182}
brother, to the assembly of God which is in Corinth". I think the "apostle" suggests the administrative side, but the "brother" suggests what is vital. Chapter 13 is what is vital; it is the "brother". We have been too much occupied with the shell of christianity, and have not got enough at the kernel. At Ephesus everything on the administrative line was in good order as yet, but the very kernel -- first love -- was gone. The point for us is, have we returned to it?
Is it love to each other or to Him? I think it refers to what had been set in motion by the Son of God. His love is the spring of all, and if we are conscious of that love we love Him and we love one another. But He never commands us to love Him; it is "Love one another". The Lord made His disciples conscious of His love, and we cannot think of our love as anything but the outcome of the consciousness of His love. It comes out in love one to another. That is Philadelphia. The point is that love one to another is set going. The coming of the Son of God and the subsequent coming of the Spirit were to the end that love might be set in movement and kept in movement in human hearts, and that is vital christianity. I feel very small in it.
In @John 13 the Lord thinks of His saints as those who need serving and His love will go down to the lowest point to, serve them. It is love that never fails. That is a character of love we need to apprehend; we are so expectant from others instead of being ready to serve them. It is in reference to His serving love that the Lord says, "A new commandment I give to you, that ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another". In chapter 13 it is the love that serves; in chapter 15 it is the love of complacency. There he says, "As the Father has loved me, I also have loved you: abide in my love". That is complacent love. There is a marked difference in that way between chapters 13 and 15. The company as viewed in chapter 15 is the fruit of divine working; it is morally the fruit of the service of love.
{183}
If this blessed love that serves lives anywhere now on earth it is in the saints. If I am not in it I am not in vital christianity. Its character comes out in @1 Corinthians 13, where we see what a 'brother' is. You have not complacent love, perhaps, towards all your brethren, for that demands certain conditions, but serving love can always be active. The apostle said, "*I* shall most gladly spend and be utterly spent for your souls, if even in abundantly loving you I should be less loved", @2 Corinthians 12:15. He was a man who had drunk into the spirit of @John 13.
The Lord went down to the lowest place to serve His own. He laid aside His garments. Does it not appeal to us to lay aside all thought of what is due to ourselves that we may by love serve one another? We have had what is outward too much in view; we have thought of gift, ability to speak and so on, but it is really greater to be a brother than to be an apostle. I have thought sometimes it was the highest thing I could say of a man, that he was a brother. It is the spirit in which gift is exercised that tells. If I want information I can buy books and get it, but no book will show you vital christianity. It has been seen livingly in a Man, and that Man accomplished redemption and went to heaven and sent down His Spirit to set in motion in men what had been so blessedly expressed in Him. Vital christianity cannot be seen in books; it is seen in people loving one another, serving one another, willing to lay aside all that is due to themselves to secure the good of others, and delighting in the brethren. In @John 13 love will *serve* to any extent: in @John 15 love will *suffer* to any extent. "No one has greater love than this, that one should lay down his life for his friends". That is not atonement, it is love suffering. Every one of us has a niche to fill in this service of love; we ought all to be exercised as to whether we are on this line. If not, something is wrong; we have not really come into contact with the Son of God, or He would have set it in motion in us.
{184}
Divine love would be ready for any opportunity. We are provided with a circle where love can be active; the Lord has provided us with brethren, and every one of them is an opportunity for the service of love.
"The only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared him". That is the revelation side, and it is most important, but we are not speaking of that now. We are looking at the blessed Son of God loving His own. "Having loved his own who were in the world, (he) loved them to the end". That is love in activity in a Man, a blessed Man, the Son of God, who loves His own to the end, and gives impulse to everything on our side so that everything that is according to God may be set in motion here in men.
Practically this results in our looking at the saints in a new light. We look at them as those whom Christ loves. That is the root of our interest in them; He loves them, and they need serving. Is that the account you take of your brethren? They are loved by Christ and they need your service. The Corinthians and the Galatians were in a bad state, but the apostle served them. Serving would oftentimes take the form of prayer. @John 13 gives an example of all service amongst saints. It tests us because it means laying aside *our* garments and girding ourselves. How often have we served a saint when it involved a going down on our part -- a laying aside of what was due to ourselves? One who can lay aside his garments and gird himself to serve is a wonderful help, and a rebuke, too, to self-importance in others. Every one knows the difference between the self-important man and one who is really serving. I have often felt rebuked by coming in contact with a man who was in the spirit of service to others in love. If we were all like that what a wonderful tone would be about the company! And babes may have part in it as well as fathers.
The object of all gift is that saints may arrive at a point when gift may be dispensed with. When we all arrive at the
{185}
unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ, gift will not be needed any more. As a matter of fact we shall not arrive at that down here. There will always be unruly ones to warn, feeble-minded ones to comfort, weak ones to support, and the need of patience towards all. We have to serve in patience; very often we get impatient because people do not answer to our expectations. We suffer long and get cross at the end, but love suffers long and is kind, kind at the end. We must not look for perfection in our brethren we must look at them as those who need serving.
In chapter 15 the disciples are looked at as those in whom the effect of the divine work has come out. They keep His commandments; they abide in His love; they are His friends, and they come out here in His moral character. It is a company in which He finds complacency; He loves them as the Father, has loved Him. He delights in them as "friends" and is on confidential terms with them. "All things which I have heard of my Father I have made known to you". They are capable of receiving His communications.
"Ye are my friends if ye practise whatever I command you". His commandment is that we should love one another, and if He sees us doing it He takes account of us as His friends. That is why love is the condition of increase of knowledge. If we want expansion in spiritual intelligence we shall get it by being united together in love. (See @Colossians 2:2; @Philippians 1: 9).
If what has been before us gets hold of us we shall think more of things in which a sister can have part as much as a brother. The service of love and intelligence in communion are as much for sisters as brothers.
To be a "friend" of Christ you must have a suited character. We should not make a friend of just any one who came along, and the Lord will not either. A friend is one you
{186}
can confide in. John and Diotrephes would not have been friends. It is a great thing for us that there have been those in our time whom the Lord could recognise as "friends" and to whom He could impart His mind -- those who have been in His confidence. The increase of light has been through those whose spiritual condition was such that the Lord could make communications to them; they were marked by the spirit of which we have been speaking. What makes you a friend is that you follow @John 13; you keep His commandments. If you answer to @John 13 you will find yourself in @John 15. Mary Magdalene got great light because she loved much, and so did Paul.
{187}
THE COMFORTER
@John 14, 15 and 16
It is a very blessed thing to know that there is a divine Person here to maintain us *for Christ*. In the first place to maintain us in affection for Christ; then to maintain us in testimony for Him in the scene of His rejection; and thirdly, to bring our hearts consciously into the knowledge and ineffable joy of the Father's counsels.
I am sure that if the question were put to the youngest believer here, do you desire to be in this world for Christ? a chord would be struck in his heart. I think the youngest believer would say, yes, by the grace of God I *do* desire to be here for Christ. Well, it is a great thing to have such a desire, because it shows that we love Him. We may feel that we are poor, weak things, and if we think of ourselves we are so indeed. But what a comfort to know that there is a divine Person here competent to maintain us for Christ in this world.
"If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever". This is the first mention, I believe, in the gospel, of the disciples¬ love for the Son of God. And He prays the Father for the gift of the Comforter in distinct connection with the fact that there is a company here of those who love Him. Now, I say to the youngest believer here, the very fact that you desire to be here for Christ shows that you belong to the company of those who love Him. You may be the smallest one in the company, but you belong to the company. If you know Him as the One who has brought every blessing to you, and secured it for you by His death, you cannot help loving Him. I believe the
{188}
first awakening of love to the Son of God is when He establishes a personal link between Himself and our hearts. I trust that most here tonight know something of it. If you want it in this gospel, I would suggest the words, "He calls his own sheep by name" (@John 10: 3). He establishes a personal link between Himself and hearts in this world. That is the great thing. It is not a question of how much doctrine we know, but how much are our hearts exult with great joy in the blessed fact that a divine Person, the Son of God, has made us conscious of His love! Think of Him coming into this world to bring to us all the favour, and blessing, and joy that divine love could offer, and securing it for us by an act that puts the seal of His love for ever on our hearts! He went into death that His love might be known by our hearts! "The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep". It is in the apprehension of this that we become conscious of His love. Not that we can compass the blessedness of it, but we are brought into it like tiny thimbles let down into an immeasurable ocean, and it becomes our distinction and glory -- the cherished satisfaction of our hearts -- that we are loved by Him. The effect of this is that we love Him; we cannot help it. When the Lord Jesus was here I have no doubt His disciples loved Him. They might not be very intelligent, as we should say. But I believe what marked them, and made them precious to the Father and to Him, was that they were conscious of His love, and they were bound to Him in affection. You may see it in Peter, when the Lord said, "Will ye also go away?" Peter answered, "Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of life eternal". He was indispensable to them; He comprised everything for their hearts; outside Him there was positively nothing. Beloved brethren, in what measure is it so with ourselves? Has He so put the seal of His love on our hearts -- so established His love there -- that He has become everything to us, and all outside Him is a blank? We may
{189}
see the same thing in Thomas. We speak sometimes of his unbelief, but let us not forget his devotedness. He said, "Let us also go, that we may die with him". Do you not think he was conscious of being loved? I am sure the disciples were conscious of being loved by the Person who was in their midst. He had brought divine love to them.
In @John 14 the Lord regards His disciples as a company in whom there is response to His love, and He says, "If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter". The gift of the Comforter is in distinct connection with the fact that we love Him, and it is the blessed mission of the Comforter to maintain our hearts in affection for the absent One.
At this point I should like to say that there are three things from the influence of which we need to be delivered, in order to be here for Christ. They are brought before us in chapters 12, 13, 14. That is the world, the flesh, and the whole sphere of sight. If we are not delivered from the influence of these things they will greatly hamper us, and hinder the response of our hearts to divine love. In @John 12 the world is judged, in @John 13 the flesh is exposed, and in @John 14 there is nothing left in the whole sphere of sight to command our hearts, because the Person who has made Himself everything to us has gone out of it. It is a very great thing for us to be in the good of this threefold deliverance -- to be in heart and spirit free from the influence of the world, and the flesh, and the whole sphere of sight. It is only as thus delivered that we can be in the power and current of the Spirit here for Christ.
The world is a great system with all kinds of ramifications, and behind it is all the power of Satan, who is its god and prince. It is the whole system of things which obtains here, in which there is nothing that is of the Father or that responds to Him. It is an immense thing to know that system as a judged thing. The Lord says in @John 12, "Now is the
{190}
judgment of this world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out". I understand that to mean that every element of the world has been brought to light and shown up in its true colours. All the perfection of the Son of the Father has been here, and there was nothing in the world that answered to it. On the contrary, its hatred of the Son and of the Father came out in full display. The world may seem very attractive with its vast political machinery, its great educational schemes, and its philanthropic institutions; but, beloved friends, it is exposed for those who love the Son of God in the very fact that it has rejected Him. For those who love Him the world is thoroughly exposed; we have no respect for its pretensions; our hearts have broken with it and are free from its influence, because the Person who has made Himself everything to us has not found a bit of response in it.
Then the flesh is thoroughly exposed in @John 13. It comes out in Judas in the most awful form, as being just material for Satan. Satan understands the flesh perfectly; he is master of all its intricacies and he can do anything he likes with it. And in Judas we see what the flesh is capable of when it is allowed to take its own course. For the sake of a paltry gain he would betray the Lord. Then in Peter we see the flesh in what might be called its best form. In Judas we see it in its worst form, but in Peter it is the flesh taking credit to itself for its constancy and its power to suffer for Christ. And what becomes of it? It completely breaks down. Beloved friends, we have to learn that the flesh is a thing that will break down. We cannot trust it for a minute. It is sure to break down. The flesh may set up to be energetic in service, to be profound in humility, to be intelligent in the things of God, to be devoted in affection to Christ, or to be eminent in spirituality. But, sooner or later, it will break thoroughly down. I trust that none of us would care to go on with something that is sure to break down in the end.
Then in @John 14 the Lord says, "Let not your heart be
{191}
troubled: ye believe on god, believe also on me". That is, He was going out of the sphere of sight, but as an unseen Person He would have His own to be linked with Him in faith and love. When He was with His disciples He so commanded their hearts that they were delivered from the power and influence of other things, and now as the unseen and absent One He would carry their hearts with Him entirely outside the range of seen things. If we are influenced and controlled by things which are seen, we come under the power of things in which Christ has no place. He has gone out of the sphere of sight, and the question is, How far has He carried our hearts out of it with Him? It is a great thing for us to be in some measure delivered from these things, for it is only as we are thus delivered that we really enter into the thoughts of divine love.
The Son of God has brought divine love here. As we read in @John 13:1, "Having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end". Everything that is not the outcome of divine love will break down sooner or later, and we do well to take this to heart. But there is something that cannot break down -- that cannot fail -- and that is divine love. I am sure the effect of knowing even a little of this love is greatly to draw us to the blessed Person who has brought it to us. A taste of it makes us long for more, and we are thus drawn to Himself.
I have no doubt that every young believer here knows what it is to pray. You pray about your pathway, about difficulties and changes in your circumstances, about your trials, and your service. But I should like to ask, Do you know what it is to get near to the Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God, that He may lead your heart into the blessedness of His own love? He may give us a taste of that love, as it were, at a distance, but it is in order to draw us to Himself, that we may learn it fully in His own company. Satan will do his best to divert us by all possible means from entering into this, but if
{192}
our hearts have really come under the power of divine love we shall not be diverted. John had come under the power of that blessed love, and responded to it, leaning on Jesus¬ bosom. It seems to me that @John 13 is the school of love The Master teaches divine love in perfection; the disciple learns with his head pillowed on that Master's bosom; and the result of the learning is that the disciples can be told to "Love one another; as I have loved you".
What a wonderful thing it is to get into His company to learn there how He loves; because His love does not ignore what the flesh is, nor does it forget our liability to be influenced and defiled by what is around us here. Yet He loves, and loves to the end. It is a blessed thing to know that His love has secured to itself the title to regard us apart from everything that is unworthy of that love. He has gone into death to remove from us divinely and for ever all traces of unsuitability to Himself. His death has set Him free, if we might say so, to love us, and as we appropriate His death it sets us free to be loved. On His side love is free, and as we appropriate His death we appropriate that which sets us free in spirit from all the sin and imperfection of the flesh, and we are *free to be loved*. The Lord Jesus looks upon us according to the thoughts of His love, and according to the perfect sanctification of His death, and thus apart from every trace of imperfection. When he "loved the assembly and delivered himself up for it", do you think He saw it in guilt and ruin? No, He saw it in its beauty, according to the thoughts of His own love. For us to enter into this there must be the appropriation of His death, and this sets us free to be loved. There can be nothing more blessed than to be free to enter into the love of divine Persons. It is eternal life, and the effect of it comes out in love one to another. Thus the saints are bound together in affection. It will be so perfectly and for ever in the Father's house. All hearts there will be full of divine love, and bound together in that love by the all-pervading
{193}
Spirit. What a wonderful thing that we may taste a little of it even here.
In @John 14 the Lord says, as it were, While I have been with you I made you conscious of My love, and made known to you the thoughts of My love. Now I am going away, but another divine Person will come to you to maintain in your hearts the link which I have formed. He will maintain in your remembrance the communications of love by which I attach you to Myself. He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. No doubt this applies in a special way to the apostles, but in principle it is true for the whole christian company. A young believer might say, If I could have been with the Lord I am sure He would have made me conscious of His love, and I should have known that love much better than I do now. Well, beloved friends, the Comforter has come to maintain in our affections those blessed communications by which the Son of God established the knowledge of His love in the hearts of His little company of disciples when He was here with them. Those communications included His "commandments" and His "word". We read in verse 21, "He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me". And in verse 23, "If any one love me, he will keep my word". As I understand it, His "commandments" are the expression of the pleasure of His love concerning *His own*, and His "word" is the expression of all that He is in *Himself*. He says, "This is my commandment, that we love one another". That is the pleasure of His love concerning us, and if we love Him we keep His commandments. They are attractive to our hearts; they win their way into our souls and are treasured, there; and they draw us in a very blessed way to Himself. Then his "word" expressed what He was in Himself; it established the knowledge of Himself in the hearts of the disciples; they knew Him in His own blessedness; they contemplated His glory. He says, "These things I have said
{194}
to you; but the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and will bring to your remembrance all the things which I have said to you". That is, the Comforter comes to maintain our hearts in those blessed affections which were formed by the communications of His love. Beloved friends, how far have we been in the good of the presence of the Comforter? He is here to maintain us thus in affection for Christ, and if we are set for Christ there is no doubt He will thus maintain us. May the thought of it be real encouragement and strength for our hearts!
Now a few words as to the Spirit being here to maintain us in testimony for Christ. We are left here for the testimony of Christ. When He came here, sent by the Father, He brought into this world everything that was perfectly suited to the Father. And He was hated, persecuted, and cast out, because the world did not know the One who sent Him. "Now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father". All the power of the world and Satan -- all the power of evil -- was put forth to get rid of Him, but, beloved friends, they did not get rid of the testimony which He brought here. And no power of evil can dislodge the testimony of God from this world. It was brought here by one divine Person, and set forth in Him in absolute perfection; it is maintained now in the saints by another divine Person -- by the Comforter. People may get occupied with the ruin and failure of things until they get completely discouraged in heart. There is immense power in getting to God's side of things, and in seeing that there are things which cannot break down, because they subsist in the power of divine love and by the Spirit of God. It is certain that everything else will break down; everything that has not its outcome from divine love, and that is not in the power of the Spirit, will break down. But the Comforter will maintain the testimony of Christ here, and it is surely the chief concern of our hearts to be in the line of that testimony. The Comforter did not
{195}
come to add to the testimony. When the Son of God was here the testimony was complete; nothing could be added to what He brought; He set forth all the blessed light and grace of the Father here, and everything that was perfectly suited to God and the Father in a man shone out in Him. And now another divine Person comes from the Father to maintain that same testimony in the assembly, the body of Christ.
The Comforter is here to maintain us in the power and grace of the wonderful testimony that came out in blessed perfection in the One sent from the Father. It came out in all its heavenly grace and beauty in Him. There may be correctness in life and doctrine, with very little display of the grace of Christ. Many believers have a line they would not care to step over; they would not like to do anything they had a conscience about; they are outwardly correct in life, and they are orthodox in doctrine. But there may be all this without much true testimony -- without much expression of the grace of Christ; there may be very little in it to give real satisfaction to the Father. In the blessed Son of God everything was divinely right -- it could not be otherwise -- but everything was in such exquisite grace that it was infinitely acceptable to the Father, and the Father's grace was perfectly expressed in it. This is true testimony. How small the consideration of it makes us feel.
I believe if we settle down with mere outward correctness the world will approve us. The world can get on very well with a Pharisee, for he is of the world; but I am sure the world will never appreciate the grace of the Father -- it will never appreciate the testimony. If we are here really in the grace of Christ, I am sure people will not understand us. They will say that we are fools and not fit for this world. The world can never understand the wonderful grace which was shown out here by the One who came from the Father, and it is the expression of that grace which constitutes true testimony now, and the Comforter is here to maintain us in it.
{196}
The subjects of @John 15 are fruit and testimony. Fruit is for the Father, and only that which is fruit for the Father is testimony in the world.
I come now to chapter 16, where the Comforter is promised as the One given to lead us into the knowledge and joy of the Father's counsels. "But when *he* is come, the Spirit of truth, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself; but whatsoever he shall hear he shall speak; and he will announce to you what is coming. He shall glorify me, for he shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you. All things that the Father has are mine; on account of this I have said that he receives of mine and shall announce it to you". The Son has an equal interest with the Father in the carrying out of the Father's counsels. It is the distinctive glory of the Father to originate those counsels, and it is the distinctive glory of the Son to give effect to them. And we, marvellous to say, are brought into a circle of things which could only be originated and carried out by divine Persons -- a circle of things where everything is the outcome of divine love. How could we enter into such things without the Comforter! It would be impossible. "I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now". But, thank God, what He could not say to the disciples He could say to the Father in the marvellous language of @John 17. He could lift up His eyes to heaven and say to the Father in their presence what He could not say to them. And we are privileged to stand by and hear one divine Person speaking to another, and occupied about us who are brought in infinite love within the circle of the Father's counsels. And not only so, but the Comforter has come to lead us into the knowledge of those counsels, and into the ineffable satisfaction and joy of the divine love which has originated them, and which will give effect to them in a universe of bliss for ever.
Beloved brethren, our great distinction is that we are
{197}
loved by divine Persons. One feels lost in the greatness of it. I feel that I have only begun to touch the verge of christianity, and nothing would please me better than for every one in this room to go away impressed by the fact that there is very much in it that our hearts have not yet been conducted into. It is an immense comfort that the Holy Spirit has come, and that it is His blessed mission to guide our hearts into the knowledge of the Father's counsels. I cannot attempt to unfold those counsels, or to do more than suggest one or two thoughts in connection with @John 17.
The ground on which all is effected is, "I have glorified *thee* on the earth. I have completed the work which thou gavest me to do". Then in verse 1 the Son asks to be glorified, that He may glorify the Father. And He brings about the Father's glory by giving eternal life to as many as the Father has given Him. It is the Father's glory to have a company of many sons capable of appreciating Himself. It is His glory to have a company of worshippers before Him. Worship is the appreciation of divine Persons, and the appreciation of divine Persons in creatures must be adoration. He would have us as sons before Him -- as those who have sprung out of the death of Christ, as those who are the "much fruit" of that precious "grain of wheat" in new creation suitability to the Father's presence. It is the very glory of the Father to have such a company. And the Son has glorified Him, and is glorifying Him, by securing that company -- by giving them eternal life. Then lower down in the chapter we find that the saints are also the glory of the Son. He says, "I am glorified in them". It is a marvellous thing that we should have been taken up, and enriched and blessed by divine love, so that the glory of the Father and the Son should be displayed in us. The assembly is the vessel of divine glory. "To him be glory in the assembly". We belong to the vessel in which divine glory will be displayed for ever. And the Comforter is come to lead our hearts into these
{198}
things, and to maintain the knowledge and the joy and the ecstasy of them in our hearts. If we enter into these things we must be beside ourselves. In the circle of divine love we are outside the range of the natural man altogether; we are in a region where nothing can sustain us but the Comforter, and He is here for that purpose.
Then the consummation of everything is that we are to be with the Son where He is, to behold His glory which the Father has given Him -- a glory connected with the love which the Father had for Him before the foundation of the world. We are to be introduced to a scene where we shall know what one divine Person can be to another, and how one divine Person appreciates another. We shall find the eternal joy and rapture of our hearts in knowing what the Son is to the Father, and in knowing the Father according to the blessed revelation of His name made known by the Son. "I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known: that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them". And the Comforter is given to show us things to come -- to give us now 'as heavenly light what soon shall be our part'.
I desire for my own heart, and for every saint of God in this company, that we should know the presence of the Comforter as a great reality. He is here to make these things real for our hearts. If we are really set for Christ, I am sure we may count upon the Comforter to maintain us in affection and in testimony for Him. And if we are responsive to divine love, He will guide us into the knowledge of those counsels in which the blessedness of that love reveals itself. May God bring the light and joy of these things a little more into our hearts!
{199}
POWER DEPENDENT ON LOVE
@John 14:15, 16
I would suggest that divine Persons commit Their power to love. We must all feel the great importance of having spiritual power, and we are reminded that it belongs to God. It is evident that power in us requires *faith*, because faith lays hold of God. He complained in a former age that there was "none ... that stirreth up himself to take hold of" Him, @Isaiah 64:7. The importance of faith cannot be exaggerated, for the Spirit of God will never carry us beyond the measure of our faith. The power of the Spirit is unlimited, but in its exercise it depends upon faith. We are apt to think of the Spirit as using us, but we ought not to lose sight of the fact that in a certain sense we may use the Spirit. For example, we put to death the deeds of the body, but we do it by the Spirit. We worship, but it is by the Spirit. It is *we* who act in the intelligent service of God, but we serve in the power of the Spirit. The Spirit is the great reservoir of power, but we have to learn to draw on it and utilise it.
Now there is a further thought: God commits His power to *love*. Only love can be trusted with power. If power were given to a man without love, it would only make him self-important; but love -- the divine nature -- can be trusted with power. When the Lord speaks of the other Comforter, He says, "If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever". How much do we love Him? I believe the blessed God delights to commit His power to those who are formed in love. Love would be prepared to sacrifice itself in every possible way to secure the spiritual profit of the assembly. God would not
{200}
be faithful to Himself if He did not support from heaven both collectively and individually those who are imbued with the spirit of love. The Spirit is here to serve as our resource, but it is *love* that takes advantage of His presence.
Let us think of that little company at Pentecost. Their souls had been steeped in the spirit of Christ, for many of them had been in His company for three-and-a-half years. The Lord is greatly concerned about this matter. I can easily account for the lack of power in my own soul; I know it well.
<blockquote>'Yet sure, if in Thy presence <br>My soul still constant were, <br>Mine eye would, more familiar, <br>Its brighter glories bear. </blockquote><p><blockquote>And thus Thy deep perfections <br>Much better should I know, <br>And with adoring fervour <br>In this Thy nature grow'. (`51:4)</blockquote>
In His company we cannot fail to be imbued with the spirit of love; *then* we can be trusted with power.
The believer is characteristically a lover of God and a lover of Christ. Let us not wander about to find reasons why power is lacking, but let us search our own souls. It has been said that His power is the servant of His love, and each one of us has spiritual power in proportion as we have love. Peter said, "Lord, if it be *thou*, command me to come to thee upon the waters". And Jesus said, "Come". Power became the servant of love, and power is commensurate with love. We are realising at the present time something of the hostile forces against the assembly, but the Lord presents Himself walking on the waters. He is supreme in presence of all the evil. Love says, "Lord, if it be *thou*, command me to come to thee upon the waters". He is superior to all the turmoil.
The word to Philadelphia was, "behold, I have set before thee an opened door, which no one can shut, because thou hast a little power, and hast kept my word, and hast not
{201}
denied my name". "A little power" is not reproach; it is commendation. In the last phase of the assembly's history it is something to Him to have a few hearts who are marked by a little power, and have not denied His name. We are in the fourth watch of the night, which is just before the dawn. The Lord had fed the multitude and gone on high to pray; He had put the little flock into the boat to go on before Him to the other side. "And when even was come, he was alone there, but the ship was already in the middle of the sea tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary", @Matthew 14:23, 24. "In the fourth watch of the night" He comes to them walking on the sea. All is suggestive of conditions at the close of the present dispensation, and of the way in which power is available to those who love Christ and are prepared to move towards Him.
{202}
THE GAIN OF HAVING THE SPIRIT
@John 14:15 - 20
There is immense gain in having the Spirit. I do not think we are sufficiently impressed with it. The disciples were wonderfully favoured to be in company with the Son of God when He was here. No doubt in His presence they anticipated, in some measure, the Spirit's day. He did much for them that was afterwards the province of the Spirit. But notwithstanding this, we cannot help seeing how little they entered into what was present with them in the Son of God, or into the communications of His love. He could say to the Father, "I have made known to them thy name", yet how little they knew the holy name that had been manifested to them by and in the Son! Fulness of grace and truth was in Him; every ray of divine glory shone out in Him; but how little was it apprehended! In this very chapter Thomas says, "Lord, we know not where thou goest ..." and Philip says, "Lord, shew us the Father and it suffices us". Again and again He spoke of His death and resurrection, but they did not understand; it was all a mystery to them.
For the understanding of all that came here in the Son of God everything depends on the presence of the Spirit. If we look at things from the Father's side everything was declared when the Son was here, but on our side everything hangs on the presence of the Spirit. Mental quickness or natural ability will not help us in these things. But the Spirit can, and does, make the Son of God and His words and works more of a reality to us than they were to those who were with Him in the days of His flesh. Saints understand now by the Spirit much that was a mystery to those who were in the very presence of the Son of God when He was here.
{203}
"He will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever". The Spirit brings in an abiding order of things in contrast to all that was broken up by the death of Christ. It was very blessed for the disciples to go about with the Messiah on earth, but it was an order of things that came to an end. Death broke in upon it. The Shepherd was smitten and the sheep were scattered. Paul said, "If even we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we know him thus no longer", @2 Corinthians 5:16. That order of things came to an end; it was not "for ever".
But when the Lord said, "Mary" to the one who sought Him in the grave that He had for ever left behind, He formed a link between Himself and her that was "for ever". When He made Himself known in breaking of bread to the two at Emmaus, and when He stood in the midst of His disciples at Jerusalem and said, "Peace be to you", He was attaching their hearts to Himself outside the scene and range of death's power altogether. It was a new order of things -- a resurrection and ascension order -- which goes on "for ever". It is from *that* side that the Spirit has come. What the personal presence and words of the risen One were to His own on the resurrection day the Spirit is to us today. He is the link with a risen and ascended Christ and an order of things which is "for ever". We have tasted deep joy in the Lord and in the thought of our association with the Son of God. Will death ever cast a shadow on that? No, it is "for ever". The Spirit is in relation to an eternally abiding order of things. Nothing can touch those things; nothing can break them up. What an immense gain it is to have a vital link with such blessed things! In the Spirit we become conscious of our association with Christ. It is a stainless and deathless joy.
"Ye know him for he abides with you, and shall be in you". Now do we know the Spirit? Is it not by what He brings before us, by His communications to us? It is in this way that we know the Spirit. No one but the Comforter
{204}
could make the Son of God a present reality to our hearts, or give us the joy of His love. If Christ is before us, and His blessed things engage our hearts, it is by the Spirit, and we know the Spirit by what He does for us in this way. He makes the Son of God a present reality to us, so that we are not bereaved of Him. The world has lost Him, but we have not. The word is fulfilled, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you".
It is as having the Comforter that we see the risen One who says, "Because I live ye also shall live". We live in association with the risen and glorified Son of God.
Then, "In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you". That verse conveys to my mind the thought of a wonderful system of divine affections.
I understand it to mean that the Son dwells in the Father's affections, the assembly dwells in the affections of Christ, and Christ dwells in the affections of the assembly. The whole of this blessed and divine system of love is pervaded by the Spirit and it is He who gives the intelligence of it for our souls¬ deep joy.
How great is the gain of having the Spirit! May we realise that gain more and more!
{205}
NOTES OF A READING
@John 15:1 - 27
V. Had the Lord Israel in view here?
C.A.C. I daresay there is a connection. The Lord Himself is the source of all fruit for the Father. It is wonderful that there should be that brought about in men that the Father can recognise as having its source in the Son. How blessed it is to think of this. It is the special interest of the Father to bring that to pass. It is that which marks the present moment.
Ques. Would you connect the chastening of @Hebrews 12 with this?
C.A.C. Yes. He purges here so that they may bring forth more fruit.
Ques. As to a branch being cut off?
C.A.C. Well, it would be removed from the place of privilege where the fruit is possible. It may have a reference to Judas. The great force of the Scripture is that nothing has any value unless it has its source in the Son and flows from Him. "Unless any one abide in me he is cast out as the branch, and is dried up". It brings before us the absolute worthlessness of anything for the Father if it does not spring from that source -- His Son; all else is worthless, only fit to be cast into the fire. We should covet to bear fruit so that the Father may see the fruit of His skill. The peculiar skill of the Father as the husbandman is brought to light by our bearing much fruit. In this chapter all fruit is made to hang on the one thing, "Abide in me". Here it is the *privilege* side but to take it up we need affection. In John believing always has in view the believing of *affection*. If we have heard from the Father we come to the Son of God. It is the effect of the
{206}
Father's work and drawing that we come to the Son of God, that is we come under His influence. "Every one that has heard from the Father himself, and has learned of him, comes to me". Well, *abide there*.
V. Pruning?
C.A.C. Well, it supposes the presence of something which is not productive of fruit. Take Peter being carried away by his Jewish prejudices so that he could not eat with the Gentiles. Well, that hindered Peter bearing fruit and Paul spoke sharply and withstood him. I think in that way the Father was purging. He was removing in that way what hindered Peter bearing fruit. If we come under the influence of the Son of God there is nothing you would desire more than that you should be fruitful -- "Ye shall ask what ye will and it shall come to pass to you". If you desire it and pray for it it shall come to pass to you. "My words abide in you" is the cleansing effect of being under the influence of Christ. Scripture never contemplated our reaching a state beyond which we do not need purging. The fruit? It is a great exercise as to how far one's thoughts and feelings and actions and words have their spring and source in the Son of God. Any single thought or feeling of that character is fruit to the Father -- it is a true grape. Perfection has come in in the Son of God so He says, "I am the true vine".
In @1 Corinthians 11 the Lord chastens. There it is in connection with the *sphere* where the Lord administers and so the Lord deals with us. Here it is the Father's hand. Here the dealing with what is positive evil is not supposed. It is help. It is not that the vine is naughty, but it is the nature of the thing that it needs care and help and the Father gives it. All this here supposes the soul under the influence of the Son of God. "As the Father has loved me, I also have loved you" -- that is love of complacency not the love of sovereignty just as the Father discerned in Him all that was suited to His love so that the Father loved Him -- it was the love of
{207}
complacency -- so it is here. The Son would love them with the love of complacency when He formed in them what was suited to His love as having come under His own blessed influence. "As the Father has loved me, I also have loved you: abide in *my* love". Everything that has its source in Him is fruit for the Father.
Ques. Fruit of the Spirit, @Galatians 4?
C.A.C. That is fruit regarded as having its source in the Spirit. It is a contrast between flesh and spirit. What has its source in the flesh and then what has its source in the Spirit. Morally it would have the same character of course but in @John 15 the fruit is looked at as having its source in the Son of God.
Rem. The whole object of the Lord was to leave a company here in which the Father would be glorified. C.A.C. Well nothing could be more wonderful, our having the Spirit of Christ, the motives and sensibilities of Christ would mark us. Do we take it in so that it might have a divine influence over one?
Ques. The Father's commandments?
C.A.C. Everything He did was in obedience. The laying down of His life was that He might take it again in obedience to the Father.
Ques. My commandments?
C.A.C. "Abide in me" -- "Believe in me", and "Love one another". These are His commandments. His commandments suppose a company loving Him. @John 14 introduces that. He had spoken of His love to a company in chapter 13 and then He suggests in chapter 14 a company loving Him, and then His commandments are not grievous. These things have I spoken unto you that your joy might be full. Well that is something to keep us bright, is it not? Joy is dependent upon the obedience of *love* -- not legal obedience. Every commandment of the Father was treasured in that blessed One and that was the true spring of His obedience.
{208}
That is to be the line on which we are to move. The Lord walked in the unbroken joy of the Father's love. Where we are so hindered is that we admit these things in the abstract and yet when we come to the practical working out of things we are humbled. The Lord says, "Love one another, as I have loved you". There is where the test comes. The way the Lord's love worked was that He laid down His life. He sacrificed Himself. At Pentecost there were 5,000 people all laying down their lives for one another. Christianity was introduced not by doctrine but *in fact*. There were those here who loved one another. It is on the wrong tack to be expecting from others; we are under the obligation to love one another. It is by coming under His personal influence that we are affected by it and we express the effect to others. It is after all only sap from the vine which is expressed in us, if we do love one another. "I am the vine, ye are the branches".
Rem. This is what the apostle John calls walking in the truth?
C.A.C. Yes. Abiding in Him is abiding in the truth of all that has come to light in that Person.
Ques. "Ye are already clean by reason of the word which I have spoken to you"?
C.A.C. That is Himself. Look at Peter -- "To whom shall we go?" That man was cleansed in his affections, for him there was nothing else. Then in connection with "friends" there is confidence and intelligence. He is on confidential terms with us.
Rem. Abraham was called the friend of God.
C.A.C. If we did but understand the pleasure of the Lord to acquaint us with His mind! We often think it is very difficult to get, but it is His pleasure to do so.
Ques. How does the Lord communicate the intelligence?
W. "The Lord will give thee understanding in all things".
{209}
C.A.C. *We* get them where the disciples got them, in nearness to Himself. It is a comfort to know that all has started from *His* side. It did not begin with you, it began with Me. "Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you", that ye should go and bring forth fruit. All the ministry of the apostles remains to this day. Then fruit remains and it is delightful to the Father and blessed for us. The end of the chapter goes on to testimony. The Comforter would come and bear witness and He goes on to say and "ye too bear witness" (verse 26). The idea of the fruit is that it is for the Husbandman -- the Father. When you come to testimony the Spirit of truth goes forth -- "... from with the Father". He goes forth in the full intelligence of the Father's thoughts as to the Son. The saints are put in company with the Spirit. They too are to go forth to witness in all. "And ye too bear witness, because ye are with me from the beginning". That is the apostles, of course, those to whom the Lord was speaking. In the light of this we can understand the apostles saying, "And our fellowship is indeed with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ".
Ques. Do you think if we were more concerned as to fruit for God we should be also as to testimony?
C.A.C. Yes, and the effect of testimony is your colour and character are so diverse to the world that they hate you. It is not our estimate of the world -- the crucial test is what does the world think of us. You discover that you are getting adrift by finding that you are approved by unspiritual people. It is a fine thing to be hated by the world. It is one of the best commendations a man could have. I mean on this line. The world's estimate of us would be that it would not want any contact with us at all. Paul could say not only am I a crucified man to the world but the world is crucified to me. It is separation from it in the best way.
{210}
THE JOY OF THE SON
@John 15:11;17:13
In venturing to suggest the consideration of the joy of the Son one is conscious of very limited capacity, and this creates a great sense of dependence. But there is something peculiarly attractive in the subject itself, and especially when we see how the Lord's words to His own, and even His words to the Father, were uttered for the purpose of making His joy known to us so that it might be in us. This applies particularly to what fell from His lips after the Supper, as recorded in @John 13 to 17. No doubt the company amongst whom He was were the assembly representatively. And what the Lord said in their midst He said as having the assembly in view, so that we see here the kind of spiritual impressions which would accompany the presence of the Lord in the assembly. An honoured servant of the Lord used habitually to read these chapters previous to being found with his brethren in assembly.
When we see that the Lord's intent in what He said was that His joy might be in the saints of the assembly it gives a distinctive character to all His utterances, and concentrates all the varied rays of divine light which shine in those utterances in one bright focus. They are all to make known to us the joy of the Son, and to put it in us -- that is, in those who compose the assembly. One wonders whether we have quite seen it all as centring in this?
This stands in very intimate relation to our knowledge of the Father. These chapters bring out clearly that the joy of the Son is to take a place with the Father outside the world in which His own can have part with Him. It is the joy of His love to have our companionship in that place. He 'came to
{211}
earth to make it known, that we might share His joys'. The true blessedness of our place with the Father is wonderfully enhanced as we see it to be the joy of the Son to go and prepare it for us. All is looked at in @John 14:2, 3 as the Son's doing -- the place prepared, the coming again, the reception to Himself, the being with Him -- all is done by the Son, suggesting that the Father's house and what is there, and the persons who are there, all is a matter of what is brought about by the Son, and He would have us to know that His joy consists in having brought it about. There would be no Father's house without the Son, and no revelation of God as Father without the Son. The Son's joy will be to have His own in the place in the Father's house which He has Himself prepared, and to which He Himself will receive them. If it is the Son's joy to do it all how great the Father's joy in it all! Everything in His house speaks to Him of the One whom He loves, and into whose hand He has given all things. In all this there will be full joy for the Father and the Son.
Then He speaks (@John 14:6 - 11) of the Father having been seen in Him. This, too, was His joy. He was in the Father, drawing all from Him, so that we might say He was filled with the Father who was in Him for revelation. He would have us to believe *Him* that this was so, but if not, to believe Him for the works¬ sake themselves. This would lead us to consider the works done by Jesus -- particularly in this gospel -- as the Father's works. The Father would bring in fulness of joy where it had to be admitted that there was no wine (chapter 2). The Father would answer a heart in sorrow by relieving it of its distress (chapter 4). The Father would relieve man of all his weakness (chapter 5), and satisfy his hunger (chapter 6), and give him sight (chapter 9), and bring him out of death's domain (chapter 11). The conditions here brought out what the Father was in a way it could not be known in heaven. All that was the Son's joy. We learn the
{212}
Father here in Jesus. We must not look at the varied conditions which He met in His blessed pathway here merely as the result of man's sin -- though that they surely were -- but as opportunities for the Son to have joy in expressing the Father. His purposes of love were not seen in the works, but in giving men a part and place with the Son in the Father's house.
But His revelation in grace as the Father was seen in Jesus here, so that the gospels stand alone in a peculiar glory which will never be seen in the same way again. There were three and a half years during which the Father was seen in Jesus, and did works which brought out His blessed nature and character in presence of all the evil conditions here. The Father was seen by mortal eyes. The immense character of the revelation may be gathered from the fact that if all the things Jesus did had been written one by one John supposed that not even the world itself would contain the books written. My impression is that it is all written in heaven in the hearts of those who saw the works done. We have only a very small part recorded of what Jesus did as having the Father abiding in Him to do the works. But not a bit of the mighty volume will be lost, and all went to make up the joy of the Son.
Then His doing whatsoever we shall ask in His name that the Father may be glorified in the Son (@John 14:13, 14) is another element in His joy. And it is part of His joy that His obedient lovers should have the Comforter. Then He has joy in coming to His saints so that they are not left orphans during the time of His absence from the world, and He has joy in manifesting Himself to faithful hearts. Then in chapter 15 His joy lies in the fact that He becomes the Source of fruit for the Father. The vine being used in this connection suggests that the fruit which the Father delights in is the joy of His saints; this is the new wine which cheers God and man (@Judges 9:13). That the fruit is on this line
{213}
would be confirmed by the Lord's words, "That my joy may be in you and your joy be full". As this comes about I believe the Father's portion is secured.
Another element in the Lord's joy is the delight He has in loving His own complacently. "As the Father has loved me, I also have loved you: abide in my love" (@John 15:9). This is clearly a complacent love, for it is *as* the Father has loved Him. It is therefore conditional; it was so even in His case. "If ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love, as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love" (verse 10). He has a peculiar joy in His saints as those who keep His commandments: obedient lovers are the only ones who afford Him this joy, or who really abide in His love. Nothing ought to affect our hearts more than to think we can minister to His joy, and, in so doing, have His joy in us. He looks that we shall be powerfully affected by the thought of His joy, and that it shall be in us as a mighty influence, bringing about that our joy is full. It must be admitted that very few saints know what it is habitually to have their joy full. Our feebleness in service and testimony largely results from our lack of this. All believers have *some* joy, but God's thought is that our joy should be *full*, and that it should be consequent on the joy of the Son being in us.
Then the Lord would have us to regard His wonderful words to the Father in chapter 17 as an utterance of joy, having for its object that His joy may be fulfilled in us. "And these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in them" (verse 13). One would not think of attempting to compass all that constitutes the joy of the Son as referred to here, but we may note some of its deep springs.
In the first place He asks to be glorified that He may glorify the Father. He speaks from the standpoint of having glorified the Father on the earth, and completed the work which the Father gave Him to do. He had brought to completion what could be done on earth, but He had before Him
{214}
a continuous glorifying of the Father which required that the Father should glorify Him in order that He should bring it about. It is now as glorified that He gives effect to every thought of divine love, and thus glorifies the Father. The Father has given Him authority over all flesh in view of full blessing being brought in for men. The divine position at the present time is that the Son has rights in grace over all flesh. And the bearing of Jesus being glorified is as wide for blessing as was the bearing of Adam's sin. The Father can be known in full blessing in spite of sin and death having come in. Looking at things as they are publicly here we might think that sin, or death, or Satan had authority over all flesh, but it is the Son who has it, and He is exercising it in giving life eternal to all that the Father has given Him. A sovereign act of the Father is needed to secure to the Son a company to whom He gives life eternal. This is the Son's joy, too, as we may see in @Luke 10: 21.
The Father is glorified as men are brought into the knowledge of Himself in the infinite grace which can set aside the power of sin and death, and bring in life eternal. At the very beginning God thought of something superior to a life of innocence amidst the good of the garden of Eden, for He put the tree of life in the midst of the garden. But the fulfilment of what was promised, if we may so say, in the tree of life awaited the coming of Jesus Christ as the Father's sent One. Then the Father was glorified on the earth in respect of all that had come in, so that He might be known in the supremacy of His grace. Not only is it atonement to cover sin, but all done to disclose the Father. Eternal life and sonship for men are the two great thoughts of divine love, and it is the joy of the son to secure them. They have been brought into manifestation in Christ, but were not available for men in their full blessedness until He was glorified, because neither could be the portion of men without the Spirit.
{215}
It is the joy of the son to be glorified as Man along with the Father with the glory which He had along with the Father before the world was (verse 5). That glory was not new to Him, for He had it before the world was, but it was new that He should have it as Man. It was the Father's prerogative to confer it upon Him as One who had become flesh, but who was now going to the Father. It was to add its ineffable lustre to Him as Man; it was now to be brought into conjunction with all that He *had* accomplished on behalf of the Father, and with all that He *would* accomplish as the Father's glorified One. That glory is now His as having had it accorded to Him by the Father, and it is a deeply essential element of His joy.
As regards the men given Him out of the world by the Father, it was His joy to have manifested to them the Father's Name. *Manifesting* refers to what He set before their eyes in His own blessed Person; the Father's Name was objectively presented to them in its fulness of grace in the Son, for it had been given to Him for revelation (verse 11). *Manifesting* would refer to what they saw. He said, "The Father who abides in me, he does the works" (chapter 14:10). What a manifestation there was in them! But *making known* the Father's name would refer, I think, to what they heard. He communicated to them the words which the Father had given Him (verse 8); as a result of those spiritual communications they kept the Father's word, and knew that all things that the Father had given Him were of the Father. They had received the communications, and knew truly that He came out from the Father, and they had believed that the Father sent Him.
The "men" saw in Jesus One who was in relationship with God as His Father, and they had a sense that the Father's love rested upon Him. The last verse of the chapter shows that the making known of the Father's Name brings the love with which He loved the Son into those to whom it is made known. And they are to have such a glory that the
{216}
world will know that the Father has loved them as He loved Christ.
It is clear that keeping the Father's word, and knowing as in verses 7 and 8, conveys the thought of great spiritual intelligence. I believe in saying these things the Lord is anticipating the Spirit's day, and the result of the Spirit's formation. The "men" were, in His eye, representatively, the assembly -- all that should believe through their word being linked up with them in the Lord's mind and heart. Had He been thinking of them as not having the Spirit one feels that there would have been some reference to the Spirit in the prayer.
The Lord would have all this known as His joy. All that is in the prayer with reference to the men given Him is covered by life eternal, sonship and glory. He would have our hearts penetrated and permeated by the knowledge that His joy is found in these things being secured to His own. But it is a joy that is not complete apart from these things having their full place with us. So He says, "that they may have my joy fulfilled in them". That is to say that His joy is brought to completion in His own as they take in the great thoughts of divine love.
{217}
THE COMFORTER HAS COME
@John 15:26,27; @John 16:7 - 15
C.A.C. It might be helpful if some brother who was present last time would give a brief outline of what came before the brethren.
J.E.B. We looked at the subject in a general way, reference being made to chapter 4 in connection with the water springing up, and to chapter 7 in connection with the Spirit not being yet come; then we went on to chapter 14 where the Lord spoke about the Comforter being sent. We dwelt on the importance of what the Lord said as to the Holy Spirit; reference was also made as to how the Spirit came in a bodily form identifying Himself with a holy Man on earth and showing the kind of Man the Spirit can identify Himself with.
L.M. It was said that He should baptise with the Holy Spirit, and there must be a suitable vessel for that. I would like to ask a question as to chapter 14; we read in verse 26, "the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, *he* shall teach you all things, and will bring to your remembrance all the things which I have said to you". Would the apostles or those He was speaking to, be capable of receiving all the sayings of Jesus and not lose one?
C.A.C. There is very much more than there is in Scripture.
L.M. How we should sit at the feet of such persons! Having the Spirit they received things by the Spirit and could impart to those who were listeners to them.
C.A.C. In chapter 14 it says, "whom the world cannot receive", which implies that the Lord had a company who were capable of receiving the Spirit. It is the reception side not the gift side, "whom the world cannot receive".
{218}
Ques. What made them capable to receive what the world could not receive?
C.A.C. In a certain sense you have begun the consideration of the subject from the top, and it is not a bad Way of considering divine things.
J.E.B. It is the right approach.
C.A.C. The divine way is to begin with the greatest and best, God has begun with the very best in bringing in His beloved Son; nothing can surpass or reach up to what God has begun with.
Ques. "Ye are already clean by reason of the word"; is that the capacity?
C.A.C. I thought the Lord had before Him a company of persons who were born of God; it is because they were born of God that they have received the Spirit. The Lord could say of them, "They are not of the world, as I am not of the world".
H.B. Is that the reason why John speaks so much more of the Spirit than do the other three gospels?
C.A.C. We have a company of persons who are capable of *knowing* the Spirit. The Lord speaks in chapter 14 of their knowing the Spirit. What a wonderful thing to know a divine Person, not in heaven but here on earth.
H.B. Is it not more the Spirit coming to be *with* the saints, not indwelling?
C.A.C. The Spirit is looked at as a divine Person with the saints collectively. You get certain light as to it in @Acts 15 where they write a letter and say, "It has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us"; the "us" was the apostles, but there was another Witness -- the Holy Spirit. The Spirit was here as witness and also the apostles. If we are to get a proper sense as to these Scriptures about the Comforter we must see it as realised in the apostles. They are not spoken of as apostles in John but as disciples, but they were with the Lord as apostles; it was those persons. They had been with
{219}
the Son from the beginning of His ministry. We have never been with the Son; the Spirit cannot bring to our remembrance in that sense.
H.J. Is that why when they were choosing another apostle in @Acts 1 they said, "It is necessary that ... one of these should be a witness with us"?
C.A.C. That is just what I mean. It was necessary that for a witness there must be one who had companied with the eleven from the beginning of the Lord's ministry. It is very important to take right measurements of these wonderful statements. The Lord had those who had been His companions and heard His words, thousands of times more than what is in the Bible. He had around Him those who were given Him of the Father -- His companions; they had heard all His words and seen all His works. The Holy Spirit brought it to their remembrance. The life of the Son of God here was cherished in their hearts, every bit of it. They heard from the lips of the Son of God Himself. There was no feebleness or failure or limited character about it; it was all spoken by the Son and brought back to their remembrance by the Spirit. They did not remember merely by their natural memory, but the Lord sent the Comforter that not a word might be lost. What a wonderful idea it gives of the assembly! Our getting the gain of it depends on our giving full place to the Comforter.
L.M. Paul would have heard some of it when he was with Peter.
C.A.C. Yes, it was a wonderful time for Paul; he spent 15 days with Peter and he would have heard what Peter could tell him of the Lord on earth.
L.M. They would probably have had sleepless nights too!
C.A.C. I do not doubt it. How they would go over it all with the sense that the One who did and said these things was now in heaven and glorified; they were the acts and
{220}
words of One who was now glorified. That is the only way to read the gospels. When Matthew, Mark, Luke and John wrote their gospels by the Spirit, it was long after Jesus was glorified. They must have thought as they wrote each sentence down, He is now in glory. We know what Jesus is *there* by learning what He was here; there is no other way of learning it.
H.B. Is it right to think that the Spirit brings to us things that are not in Scripture?
C.A.C. We are limited in a way to Scripture because God has been pleased to make a certain selection of the words and acts of His Son when here on earth; it is a divine selection so that there is enough to give us a sense of that Person and His glory. In our present condition we do not need to add to what is in Scripture. It is quite likely that Peter told Paul that the Lord had said, "It is more blessed to give than to receive". The four gospels are a pamphlet which is easily read in a day, but think of the amazing character of what came out, of the words and deeds of Jesus done in the presence of His disciples! Heaven is enriched by what the disciples saw and heard and it will never be forgotten; it will be told to their brethren in eternity. It is like the five loaves and two fishes; the Holy Spirit can magnify it. There are some verses in Scripture that have been preached and spoken of for over 1,900 years. Take @Luke 15: I have heard hundreds of sermons on it but I have never heard it spoken of but that there has been something I have never heard before! We have little idea of the resources that lie in the Spirit; all the unrecorded acts and words of Jesus are known to the Spirit.
H.B. Would you say a little of what is involved in the Spirit of truth?
C.A.C. The substance of truth is in Christ but the spirit of truth is in the Holy Spirit. The whole substance of truth is in a risen and glorified Man; He is the truth but the Comforter
{221}
is the Spirit of truth, the spirit of it all.
H.B. Is the truth a different thought from the Spirit of truth?
C.A.C. The full truth shines in Jesus glorified; the Holy Spirit is a divine Person who is equal to it all, but He takes a place of subjection and subordination in coming down to be in the saints. The Son took a subject place in becoming Man; the Spirit has taken a subject place without becoming incarnate. It is possible for us to get the gain of the Comforter.
L.M. Whatsoever Christ had said they were to have brought to their minds, and the Comforter was to take of His and show it to them. Would you limit that to them?
C.A.C. I think they were a representative company; they represented to the Lord the whole church company, but they had this immense privilege of being with Him in the days of His flesh, which we have not. The same Spirit who brought things to their remembrance is still with the assembly and dwelling in the saints, so there is an unlimited supply of truth; the whole truth is opened up. "All the truth" would include Paul's ministry and that was additional to what the twelve had: Paul's ministry is connected with Christ in glory and His body here.
L.M. Could you give Paul anything he did not know? C.A.C. Paul could give me a great deal I do not know! The teaching of John comes in to fill up Paul's ministry; it came in to enrich the assembly long after Paul had departed to be with Christ. The ministry of John is to fill with vital power the truth that came out through Paul. John brings in vitality when the church was in danger of slipping away from Paul's ministry. John brings in restoration in a vital way by bringing in what was true in the Son of God and maintained here in the power of the Comforter. He brings in the greatest things of all. Take the truth that comes out in John's gospel, i.e. eternal life. It is all connected for us now with
{222}
Paul's ministry, for it supposes that Jesus is glorified; the realisation of it depends on that.
Ques. All believers who have succeeded the twelve, are they not included in, "I do not demand for these only, but also for those who believe on me through their word"?
C.A.C. Yes; John has in view Paul's ministry. We read in chapter 10, "I have other sheep which are not of this fold: those also I must bring ... and there shall be one flock, one shepherd" -- that is Paul's line. Caiaphas¬ prophecy was John's way of putting Paul's ministry. John goes right through to the end.
H.B. The Lord always brings in the Spirit in connection with the Father, not in connection with God.
C.A.C. Yes, it is a striking thing. The Spirit is connected with the Father -- "*I* will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter". It is a great thing that John speaks of children who are born into the family and have a nature; they belong to that sphere in nature. He does not speak so much of sonship but of nature in which sonship can be enjoyed.
L.M. There are fathomless depths in the last verse of @John 17. We are brought to a marvellous place, loved as the Lord Jesus is loved and He in us. That would not be limited to the twelve.
C.A.C. The twelve in John's sense are not separated from the whole church company. Those around the Lord at the Supper table were representative under His eye of the whole church company. We come into that wonderful company as disciples; we can all come in there.
J.E.B. What is the idea of @John 14:26, "whom the Father will send in my name"?
C.A.C. The Comforter is sent on behalf of the Son; He is sent by the Father so that nothing shall be lost. The wonderful character of the Lord's words and acts is secured from being lost by sending the Comforter; it is all secured to
{223}
their remembrance. It is all treasured; nothing that came out in the Son shall be lost; it is too precious to the Father to allow a single word or act to be lost.
L.M. There is a sense in which the Spirit brings home the present activities and words of the Lord in glory.
C.A.C. Yes, I think so. The Spirit comes as having heard certain things from the Father. It is wonderful the place the Comforter has taken; He does not speak from Himself, but what He hears He speaks. He does not take the place of giving His own testimony in this verse (chapter 16:13) but of speaking of what the Father shall give to Him.
H.B. If He is the Spirit of truth and guides into all the truth, that involves what the Lord did on earth and His present position as glorified.
C.A.C. Yes. It is what the Father says to the Spirit; there are wonderful things coming.
L.M. When the truth of headship was given to J.N.D. was that the Spirit's voice from glory?
C.A.C. I think it was receiving of His and making it known. There are certain things that belong to the Father and Son in common. It is wonderful that we are brought to know of things that the Father and Son have in common that are going to be brought out in display shortly. The Comforter shows the saints all that character of things. All that is coming is known in the assembly so that the Father and Son are praised in the light of what is coming in shortly. There is a wonderful system of things connected with the Father and the Son; the Father is revealed in the Son and the Comforter is given to the saints. What a wonderful system of divine affections! It is soon going to be brought into display and the world will know that the Father sent the Son, and that He loves the saints as He loves the Son. The world and all who have rejected Christ will be made to know that He is the One whom the Father sent and that the Father was with Him in all He said and did. The more you think of the Father and
{224}
the Son, the more surprising it is to think that the saints should be brought into wonderful relation with divine Persons.

THE DESIRES OF THE SON OF GOD FOR HIS OWN
@John 17:11, 15, 21, 24
These verses bring before us what was in the heart of the Son of God as He went into death. These are some of His last words, they show what filled His heart as He went to the cross. It is impossible to say much on a scripture like this. There is something so great and sacred about the Son speaking to the Father at such a moment! But we are permitted to hear this outpouring of His desires with regard to His own, and He can make it speak to our hearts with divine power.
There are four great desires in the prayer. First, that His own might be kept in the Father's name: "Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be one as we". The Son was here to declare the Father's name. That name had been given to Him that He might make it known to men. This was the work which the Father had given Him to do. The thought of the Father's name was the last thing before Him ere He went to the cross (verse 26), and it was the first thing before Him as the risen One (@John 20:17). The Father gave His name to the Son that He might reveal it. The depths of infinite divine grace and love and holiness -- for it is "Holy Father" -- are in that name, and all was given to the Son that He might make it known. In going into death the Lord had before Him the unspeakable suffering of that hour when sin must be dealt with according to divine holiness, but it was from *the Father's hand* that He took the cup, and He took it that the glory of *the Father's name* might appear. His great thought was, "Father, glorify thy name" (@John 12:28). Sin was to be put away, reconciliation effected; but, above and beyond all, *the Father's name*
{226}
was to come out in its glory of grace. This was the supreme thought in the heart of the Son of God as He drew near to death. Do we think enough of this, beloved brethren?
The Son of God went into death that we might know the blessedness of the Father's name. The goodness, grace, love, and glory of that name are all told out, and the One who made it known is the One who can instruct our hearts in it. His desire is that we should be kept in the Father's name. How wonderful and blessed to think of being kept in that name! What rest, what peace, what joy! An Old Testament saint could speak of being hidden in Jehovah's pavilion, and in the secret of His tent (@Psalm 27:5), but our pavilion is the Father's name! The Son would have us enclosed in all the blessedness of the Father's name, kept in the grace of that name, kept in the love of which it speaks! That is our "secret place". The apostles were kept in the Father's name, and hence in perfect unity of testimony.
Then as to the world the desire of the Son of God is, "I do not demand that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them out of evil" (verse 15). How does the Father keep us out of evil? I am assured that it is by filling us with what is supremely good. "Sanctify them by the truth: thy word is truth". The truth is in a living Person and the Father would make that Person to our hearts the embodiment of everything worth knowing. The taint of evil is upon the best things in the world, but *good* in absolute perfection -- even the perfect setting forth of the blessed God -- is in Christ. There is preservative power in the knowledge of Him to keep us out of all the evil here.
"And I sanctify myself for them, that they also may be sanctified by truth". He was ever morally separate from the evil of the world, but now He has taken a place, as the risen and glorified One, entirely apart from it. His death, in that sense, was the moment of His entire separation from the scene and circumstances where sin was. He is wholly apart
{227}
from all that is evil, and He is in that holy sanctification at God's right hand that the knowledge of Himself *there* may keep us out of all the evil here.
Then in verse 21 there is a third desire: "That they may be all one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that *they* also may be one in us, that the world may believe that thou hast sent me". I trust that we may know more of that blessed unity in the divine nature in which the Son of God would have all His own to be. These are feeble days, and the practical realisation of unity is much hindered, but there *is* unity in the divine nature. In every bit of true knowledge of the Father and the Son there must be unity. It is "that they also may be one in us". If believers know the Father and the Son they come into this unity, for wherever the knowledge of the Father and the Son is there must be unity of a profoundly real nature. It is the knowledge of divine Persons that brings about unity, for it gives saints a common portion of joy and blessedness in which there is no element of discord.
"Father, as to those whom thou hast given me, I desire that where I am they also may be with me, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me, for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world" (verse 24). In the first desire of the Son of God the prominent thing is *the Father's name*, in the second it is preservation from the evil of the *world*, in the third it is unity amongst *saints*, but in the fourth it is *the Son of God Himself*. He desires His own to be with Him where He is, that they may behold His glory. Think of the glory that has been given to the Son by the Father! It has been given to Him to bring to pass every purpose of love and blessing that was in the Father's heart from eternity. This is His peculiar and distinctive glory. He will give effect to all the Father's purpose. In the midst of a universe of bliss where every thought of "the Father of glory" will be accomplished we shall behold the glory of the Son. If not one trace of evil is to be found in that blessed and holy universe it is
{228}
because *the Son* has removed it all in redemption. If every element of divine perfection and joy pervades the whole of that vast scene of glory it is because *the Son* has brought it in and established it on an immutable basis. The Father of glory will be known as the source of all, but the Son will be known as the accomplisher of all. This place the Father's eternal love has given Him; it will be His distinctive glory for ever.
He will have His saints with Him where He is to behold His glory. As we behold it eternal rapture and praise will surely fill our hearts.
I cannot say more. How infinitely great are these blessed things! May the Son of God give us understanding of these desires of His heart as He went into death! It is good for us to have before our hearts what was before His. May we cherish these great and holy thoughts, that they may be expanded in our souls, and take more effective possession of our hearts!
{229}
THE ACTIVE GRACE OF CHRIST RISEN
@John 20:1 - 23; @Luke 24:13 - 36
I am bringing before you some very familiar scriptures; indeed, they are so familiar that it is well if our very familiarity with them has not hindered us from realising the importance and blessedness of that of which they speak. We have often been reminded that the first day of the week -- the resurrection day -- imparts its own peculiar character to Christianity; nor does it close without presenting in pattern the assembly -- the saints gathered, the Spirit given, and the Lord in the midst.
My object in adverting now to this day is to bring briefly before you the activities of the Lord in resurrection. Does it not awaken at once a lively interest in our hearts when we ask how was the blessed Lord engaged on that memorable day? We have often, it may be, meditated with profound delight on His activities in the days of His flesh. We have followed Him through the day of His activity as Jehovah's Servant on earth, from its sunrise at the baptismal waters of Jordan to its sunset in that awful hour of the power of darkness, when the night came of which He spake when he could no longer work. Blessed, indeed for us to know that the night did not overtake that peerless Servant until His work was done! I speak not -- for the moment -- of atonement, but of all those ceaseless activities of grace, in which He was the Servant of Jehovah's pleasure, and the Son of His Father's love as a Man upon the earth.
Then I trust every heart in this company has lingered with adoring thoughts of faith and love in presence of the work accomplished on the cross. There we see the One of whom we can say, through grace, that He is all our salvation, accomplishing the work which gives Him title to be
{230}
thus known by our poor hearts. There we see our sins and our whole state as children of Adam brought before God, and we see a divine Saviour under judgment and in death, that He might settle every question that sin had raised between God and our souls, and that He might so deliver us as to make Himself the object of our faith and the One in whom our hearts should find their every blessing and joy for ever.
But "the first day of the week" finds Him in a new condition. The "days of his flesh" ended; all His earthly associations with Israel and with men in the flesh entirely broken. He now comes forth in resurrection to be the Source and the Giver, and to present in His own Person the character of blessings altogether new. I am increasingly persuaded, my brethren, that the Holy Spirit would lead our heart's affections to that Risen One: and in order to do this my present object is to bring before you His gracious activities as the Risen One. Have you thought of the round of service that occupied Him on that eventful day? We may truly say that it was a busy day for our blessed Lord.
His first action -- and surely love would have it so -- was to meet and satisfy the longings of a heart that had no object but Himself. A heart like Mary's had the first claim, we may say, on the attention of the Lord. And, beloved, to such a service as this His heart would joyously turn. His own precious words were -- oh! that we may treasure them in our hearts -- "He that loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will manifest myself to him" (@John 14:21). With what delight did his eyes rest upon that early visitor to His empty tomb! She loved Him, and her love called forth the expression of His. She *wept* for Him; she *sought* Him; she *loved* Him; and He loved her and manifested Himself unto her.
Now, beloved Christians, are *our* hearts turning from everything that is here because of the treasure we have in
{231}
Himself? There is such a thing as turning from the world as philosophers and monks turn from it, in disgust, when it has disappointed and vexed us, or when our power to enjoy its things is gone, or in a religious way to build up a religious character for ourselves. But the Lord looks for something different from this. He looks -- yes, He is looking now -- for the heart that longs after Himself. Has the treasure we have found in His love really separated our hearts from everything here?
I do not ask whether you understand church truth, or dispensational truth, or resurrection truth. You might know a great deal about these things and yet be like the disciples of whom we read in @John 20:5 - 10. They saw. Yes! it was as clear as noonday that the Lord was risen. They believed, too, that He was risen. But though the intelligence was right and the faith was right, there was something else which was singularly wanting -- perhaps I ought to say dormant. Can you understand the lack of that wanting element? Have you no key to it in your own experience, which compels you now to own in your conscience that their condition is but a picture of your own? Indeed, my brethren, we *see* many things clearly enough; we can perhaps define them with mathematical accuracy; in a certain way we believe them; and yet our practical everyday life is but little affected thereby. We still live in the narrow, selfish circle of our own things and our own interests. "The disciples ... went away again to their own home".
It was far different with Mary. Hers was a widowed heart. The sunshine of her life had gone. As someone has said, all the world was a blank to her because He was gone. Neither apostles nor angels could fill the void in that bereaved heart. Christ had made Himself *everything* to her; with Him she had all, without Him she had nothing. It is easy to speak with cold criticism of her lack of intelligence; but, my brethren, it might be well for some of us if we could
{232}
part with some of our intelligence, and receive in exchange a little more of that whole-hearted and self-forgetting affection for Christ, which made her homeless and without an object in the world where He was not.
It was to a heart like hers that the Lord delighted to manifest Himself. A single word sufficed to dispel the sorrow of that broken heart, and to fill it with immeasurable satisfaction and delight. It was that one word "*Mary*". It was not any communication made. It was nothing but Himself, and the consciousness of His presence and love borne into her heart, as the well-known Shepherd's voice called His sheep by name. Divine communications of the most wonderful nature followed, but there must be a suited condition of heart to receive divine communications, and that condition of heart was found in Mary. That one word from His lips filled and satisfied her heart. She had reached Himself, and that was everything. It was to a heart like that that the blessed Lord could make communications which surpass all human thought -- to such a heart He could unfold what divine love would do for its own delight in the blessing of its objects.
*Her love* would have kept Him here, and been content to follow Him still as the Messiah upon earth; rejected and dishonoured indeed, but still to her the chiefest among ten thousand and altogether lovely. But *His love* had its own secrets, and He tenderly set aside her thoughts that He might replace them by His own. "Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father". His death had, proved there was nothing for Him here, but it had also proved that there was nothing for Mary here. Now He leads her heart to a new world by telling her that He is going there. She had known Him here and lost Him; now He reveals Himself to her in connection with a scene where nothing can ever break the link with Himself. He is going to His Father, but He is going as the Leader of a chosen race. He has those in this world
{233}
whom he owns as His brethren -- His Father is their Father, and His God is their God, and His love would have them to know this new place of association with Himself as the Risen One. What a revelation to the sorrowing heart that yearned after Himself! She had found Him in resurrection, in a new condition where the links could never be broken, and she had learned that she was one of a company whom He owned as His brethren -- all of one with Himself. Every longing in her heart was more than satisfied. Beloved brethren, is it so with ourselves? If not, depend upon it we have not really taken in the thoughts of His love, and it may be the Lord has not found in us that freshness of affection for Himself that would set Him free to communicate those thoughts to us.
But it is not with all as it was with Mary. Alas! how few there are whose hearts are wholly absorbed by Christ! There are many whose hearts are not free because their consciences are burdened. They are not right with the Lord. They are under a cloud. They can say --
<blockquote>'What happy hours I once enjoyed, <br>How sweet their memory still!'</blockquote>
But their spiritual joy has fled. Instead of holy thirstings after Christ, and the joy of His love, there is nothing in their soul's secret history but sadness and reproach. How is it? In some way the flesh has been allowed, the Spirit has been grieved, and the Lord dishonoured. *The conscience is soiled*, and the matter has never been bottomed with the Lord. On that resurrection day, while Mary's heart was being made glad as we have seen, there was another disciple who was under a cloud. Poor Peter! Who can tell the agony of that fervent spirit since the hour when the Lord turned and looked upon him, and he went out and wept bitterly?
I may here remark that there are two things to which almost every fall can be traced. One is spiritual indolence, and the other self-confidence. David is an example of one,
{234}
and Peter of the other. It was "at the time when kings go forth"; why then was David tarrying at Jerusalem? A pernicious indolence clogged his footsteps, and you know the consequences. No doubt the palace royal was more congenial to flesh and blood than the battle-field, but tarrying there threw David into temptation he would never have had if with purpose of heart he had been acting as a king. If the Lord has called you to any service and you neglect it, you are sure to get into trouble. Lot is another example of spiritual indolence. The mountain life, with its daily exercises and its constant demand for the energy of faith, was too laborious for him. His eye rested upon well-watered plains. The dwellings of Sodom seemed more secure than the mountain tent, and he went down to the city whose sin was "pride, fulness of bread, and careless ease". You may shrink from the troubles of faith, but if you shirk them you will have the troubles of sin, which are much worse to bear. If you look back to see where you have dishonoured the Lord, I think you will see that it was when you had been neglecting the Word of God and private prayer, and your heart was not going diligently after the things of the Lord.
In Peter we see self-confidence. He loved the Lord, and he was confident in the strength of his love, and he needed to learn what a bruised reed he was. He did learn it, as we know, in a most humiliating way, and bitter was the lesson to his soul. Who can tell what scalding tears coursed down his cheeks! and what bitter self-reproaches he heaped upon himself! But was he forgotten by the Lord? Nay! @Mark 16:7 reveals a precious touch of grace: "tell his disciples and Peter". Why should Peter be specially mentioned? Would it not have been enough to have said "his disciples"? Ah! Peter might have said, I cannot call myself a disciple any longer. I have denied Him. Such a name is not for me. So it must needs be that Peter has special mention. Then, furthermore, @Luke 24:34 tells us of
{235}
the Lord's second appearance in resurrection, "The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to Simon". We know not what passed at that private interview, but I will venture to say that there was so much confession on Simon's part, and so much tender and gracious love on the Lord's part, that when the Lord and Simon met again, within the closed doors in the evening, no uneasiness or shyness remained to hinder Simon from enjoying the presence of his Lord.
If there is a Peter here tonight -- one who has failed, and dishonoured the Lord -- I can tell you that that dishonoured Lord loves you still, and it would give His heart great joy to remove the soil from your conscience and to make you happy in His love. Is there a shadow between your heart and Himself? Has something been allowed to get in, so that, instead of being happy with the Lord, you are ill at ease? You feel that there is a reserve, and you are reluctant to go straight to Him and to have it all out. The Lord would have that reserve to be banished from your heart, and this is the great object of His present dealings with you. He makes you conscious of your sin, but He does not fail to assure your heart of the constancy of His love. Look at all those links in the chain of His gracious dealings with Peter: (1) the prayer, @Luke 22:32; (2) the warning, verse 34; (3) the counsel, verse 46; (4) the look, verse 61; (5) the message, @Mark 16:7; (6) the private interview, @Luke 24:34; (7) the full restoration, @John 21:15 - 17. Every link bears the stamp of divine and changeless love. The Lord would not rest until He had His poor disciple alone with Himself to have it all out. It is to this end that He is speaking to *you*. Satan would keep you away from Him, and use the failure to create and widen a breach between you and the Lord. The active grace of the Lord comes after you now, as it went after Peter, that the breach may be completely healed. Get alone with Him and have it all out. Make a clean breast of the whole matter; go to the very bottom of it with Him; and you will find that
{236}
He will remove the shade from your heart and the stain from your conscience, and give you a deeper sense of His love than you ever had before.
But the Risen One has now before Him another service. He first satisfies a sorrowing heart; then relieves a soiled conscience; and then He has to think of straying feet.
Mark how the Holy Spirit introduces the subject! "And behold, two of them were going on the same day to a village distant sixty stadia from Jerusalem, called Emmaus". It is as though the Holy Spirit marvelled at such a thing. They were true disciples; they loved the Lord and they were not happy in going away; they had heard that He was alive -- and yet they went! While He was with them He kept them, as He said; but now that He was gone and nothing remained for sight, they sorrowfully decided that the best thing they could do was to go back, as I suppose, to their own home.
We may be under influences of a natural kind which keep us outwardly right, without being at all in the faith of God's purpose. Then when the influences are removed we drift back to our own things. How often we see saints whose feet are kept right so long as certain influences are acting on them, who turn into a wrong path as soon as those influences are removed. I do not mean going into sin, as men speak, but going back to think only of their own things. It was so with Paul's converts. When he was put in prison he had to say that all in Asia had turned away from him, and that all were seeking their own things and not the things which were Jesus Christ's.
The fact was that the two whose course we are now considering were disappointed. Things had not turned out as they expected. Disappointment is a fruitful source of backsliding. Then let us be quite sure that our expectations are according to God's purposes. If we expect on the line of God's purpose we shall never be disappointed. These two had been looking for earthly blessing in connection with a
{237}
living Messiah, and when all hope of this had been withered by His death they were sad and disheartened. Their expectations were on a wrong line but the blessed Lord goes after them and speaks to their hearts that He might lead them on to the line of God's purposes in resurrection. Think of Him, just risen from the dead, walking eight miles with those two wanderers that He might conduct their hearts into the wonderful secret that God was going to establish everything in resurrection! In short, He was leading their hearts to Himself in that new and "out of the world" condition into which He had entered as the Risen One. With that surprised burnings of the heart did they hear of the wonderful change in God's programme, which the Old Testament scriptures had announced beforehand. As their feet paced the road to Emmaus their hearts and minds were being conducted by the wondrous Stranger along a moral road which ended in the revelation of Himself in resurrection.
Do not let us suppose that the journey is one which only *they* needed to take. It is equally necessary and important for ourselves. It is so easy and natural for our hearts to connect the blessings of God with ourselves as men in the flesh, instead of seeing that the blight of death is upon everything that is of that order. We have to learn that all the blessings of God's present grace are wrapped up in One who is risen from the dead, and in order to reach them and have the joy of them we must reach Him who is no longer to be known after the flesh. If all expectation of blessings of a natural order is blighted by His death, He reveals Himself in resurrection as the Source of infinite blessings of a spiritual order. When at length He made Himself known as the Risen One to the two disciples, it dawned upon their hearts that there was a new order of blessing infinitely surpassing all the earthly blessings for which they had been looking. Instinctively they turned at once to seek the company of their brethren. His death had broken all the earthly links that had
{238}
held them together, and had put them outside everything that was recognized by men; but now His resurrection had put a new complexion upon everything, and they hastened to be found with the company which had been gathered, as someone has beautifully said, by the message sent by the Risen One to His brethren. His gracious service had accomplished its end.
Thus, at the close of that memorable day, were the brethren gathered together upon the new ground that Christ was risen, and that as the "brethren" of the Risen One. He could have His own joy in being in their midst. I do not enter now into the wonderful character of that gathered company. You may perhaps feebly conceive what it was to Mary, to Peter, and to the two disciples of Emmaus to know the Lord in His new condition as the Risen One, and found in a company to whom He could manifest Himself! But what was it for Him to gather *His own company* thus for the first time around Himself as the Risen One! In the midst of that company His heart could let itself freely out. He was in the peace of accomplished redemption, for all the judgment of sin was fully borne; God was glorified; His work was finished; the storm that had bowed His blessed head was hushed for ever. He was now in cloudless peace, but it was peace which He could share with this gathered company. He could impart to them the same peace that He was in as the Risen One. Then if *He* had been quickened out of death by the Spirit, He would associate this gathered company with Himself in life, breathing upon them the Spirit of Life. To that company He could declare the Father's Name; in their midst He could sing praise to God; and He could entrust to them the maintenance of His interests and glory, as the Father's interest and glory had been entrusted to Him. It was a company gathered by and for Himself; His own company, or, as He says in @Matthew 16:18, "My assembly".
May we better understand that it is the purpose of His
{239}
love to have us here for Himself, and that all the wonderful grace that meets us in our need -- whether it be that of the sorrowing heart, the soiled conscience or the straying feet -- is bent upon dealing with us in such a way as to free us for Himself and for His own company! May we know truly what it is to be gathered together to His name!
{240}
CHRIST ASCENDED
@John 20:16 - 18; @John 7:39
We have been looking on previous occasions at the Lord's death and at His resurrection. We remember Him in the place where He has died and we have the privilege to apprehend Him as risen and our association with Him is as risen; but we do not get the full height of the place and blessing of the assembly until we know Him as ascended. So it is noticeable in this Gospel the Lord does not detain His lovers with the resurrection scene. He is risen, but He tells Mary not to touch Him; He is not to be touched even as a Risen One. The Lord would impress upon us in that way, blessed as it is to know Him in resurrection, that resurrection is a transitional thought -- it is not a permanent one. Resurrection is a point of transition from the days of His flesh to His condition as ascended and glorified. So if we want to know the full and permanent thoughts of God in regard to the assembly we have to know Christ in ascension, and I think it is of great importance to see that we get the Spirit from an ascended Christ. We do not get the Spirit from Christ after the flesh or from Christ risen, but the Spirit comes from Him as ascended.
In the beginning of this gospel John the Baptist says, "*He* it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit", as much as to say that *that* is the great service. All that the Lord did in the days of His flesh was not to be compared with the baptising with the Holy Spirit, and He did not do this until He was glorified. Every one who has the Spirit has a wonderful link with Christ in ascension. It is of the greatest importance to see that in John -- especially in this chapter (20) -- the Lord would not have us linger in the resurrection scene because He was going to ascend to the Father, and He brings this
{241}
before us again and again. He is going to the Father and that is the terminus.
Resurrection is relative to what lies behind; ascension is relative to what lies before. Resurrection is relative to death, so it is the bringing out from the domain of death into life and is in contrast to death, but ascension leads to an entirely new scene where death never was, nor where there is any background of sin. Ascension is relative to all that lies ahead, so it brings into view the whole position of the blessing which divine love has purposed and has brought to us by the ascension of Christ. In chapter 20:17 "Father" comes before "God" and that, I think, is the right order in relation to what the Lord had before Him. It is this wondrous place with His *Father* that the Lord Jesus had before Him. It is the name of grace; it is the name that the blessed God has been pleased to take in His limitless grace -- how He can be known in superlative grace by man, and He is Christ's Father and Christ was going to Him. There is a certain limitation about the name "Father", but there is no limitation about "God", so He says "Father" first.
He was ascending, which takes us at once out of a scene where death has been; He was going up. It was a much more marvellous moment than when Jesus walked on the water which more represents the resurrection condition -- but He is going up which is a far more extraordinary thing than walking on the water. For Him to ascend is wonderful. We ought to think of the greatness of it that He ascended in His own power. He was not carried up in this scripture; He ascends and goes up in the liberty and power of His own Person. Have we thought enough about this? There is moral elevation about it. He "lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, Father". What elevation there is in the contemplation of this!
It is wonderful to think of His going up, and wonderful, too, to think of what it was to the Father -- what a meeting;
{242}
what a greeting when he ascended to the Father! We think of @Luke 15 and the greeting there, but the Lord would show us something greater than that; He would show us how He was received as the ascending One. He was ascending to the Father as One who had brethren, and He has brethren in a heavenly order of things. Now to get the proper worship of the assembly we must understand this. It is good to see it is a new place never before occupied by man, and therefore has never been forfeited and never can be forfeited. It is occupied by One who can ascend to the elevation where the Father is and from that elevation he claims His own as His brethren, and as associated with Him in that nearness of position and condition.
John does not stress the thought of relationship. What he stresses is the character and condition in which we take our place before the Father as brethren of the ascended One. But we are in Him now as having ascended and as claiming us for an order of association with Himself which is heavenly and glorious. It began with Jesus glorified and has no defect. There is a link with @Ephesians 1:3, 4, but this is the way John presents the truth of it. One is outside all the rack and ruin of this world and out of the feebleness of earth.
It is wonderful to think of the delight of the Father in receiving Jesus. At the end of Luke's gospel the Lord is *carried* up to heaven which relates more to the side of leaving His disciples behind. He *ascends* in the sense of taking them with Him. In Luke He led them out as far as Bethany, a place where resurrection is known, and they are to preach repentance and remission of sins beginning at Jerusalem -- the commencement being from the platform of resurrection and intending to impress the disciples that they had a link with an ascended One. Resurrection is only a step and not a terminus. Christ is raised and the saints are to be raised. "And such as the heavenly one, such also the heavenly ones". Resurrection leaves us on the earth, so that
{243}
when the Lord comes for us there will be for a brief moment saints standing upon the earth, and it is at that moment that death will be swallowed up in victory. No saint will be left in his grave from Abel onwards. What a wonderful moment!
Then there is the *heavenly* One, not only the *risen* One. It is that heavenly One whose image we shall bear. Resurrection is for a moment but we shall not remain there, for we are to bear the image of the heavenly One -- not the risen One, and I think there is a difference of conditions. There is a difference in knowing Jesus as in resurrection and knowing Him as glorified. I wonder if it is really in our souls that we come to His Father in that condition spiritually now. What an elevation it would give to the worship of the assembly if we had in our souls that we go to the Father in the light and in the power of the eternal condition which is substantiated in Christ ascended.
There is no type in Scripture of Christ ascended to the Father, and if we do not learn it in Christ we shall not know it at all. He refers again and again to His going to the Father -- an entirely new thing to Him and to the Father. It was something quite new that He should go to the Father; there had never been anything in heaven like that: a new condition of manhood even with Christ, and He is the model. What an education for us in the morning meeting! We have not the condition but we have the Spirit which has come from an ascended Christ. He has come from that place with the Father where Christ is. We have something better than the condition; a divine Person is greater than any condition and the saints are to be in the power of the Spirit. It connects persons here with Jesus glorified and with the Father.
"Whatsoever he shall hear he shall speak". What does the Holy Spirit hear? "All things that the Father has are mine", and those things are connected with ascension. In chapter 14 it says the Spirit "will bring to your remembrance", but when we come to chapter 15 it is a question of witness-bearing
{244}
and the Spirit is the witness with the apostles. Chapter 16 is connected with the whole realm of the Father's things and the Holy Spirit is given as One who has received these things. The Comforter has become the Vessel to bring them to us, and He brings things from that realm where Jesus is the ascended One. The Spirit is conversant with things. It is wonderful to think of a divine Person in heaven getting communications from the Father and coming down here to announce them.
Resurrection has to do with the condition where sin and death have been, but when we come to the thought of the Father and the Father's realm, we are outside the thought of sin and death altogether. There never was a man in heaven until Jesus ascended but now there is a Man there and He has brethren, and the Spirit comes from there to make us acquainted with things in that realm. Every day I wonder at the marvellous character of Christianity!
It is for us to come into line with the Comforter who will make things real to us, and if we gave more place to the Comforter we should get enlargement as to what to speak to the Father. "Abby Father" is through the Spirit of Christ ascended, not only as risen. It is the Spirit of His Son as glorified and now in our hearts crying, "Abba Father", the Spirit of God's Son giving us the impulse in that direction. Think of a spiritual brother in the morning meeting; there are young believers present, and that brother gets up and speaks to the Father as understanding the Father's realm and the Father's things: this gives an impulse and prompts in that direction. The *Spirit* cries "Abba Father"; it is not, to begin with, that we cry "Abba Father"; we have the Spirit of sonship which leads us to this.
The Holy Spirit has taken a place of service, "Whatsoever he shall hear he shall speak". Christ after the flesh in His beautiful life here, marvellous to the heart and to the eye of God, and charming us, is no more. Paul says, "Yet now
{245}
we know him thus" (according to flesh) "no longer", @2 Corinthians 5:16. The resurrection scene is brought to an end, but in ascension Christ is in the eternal condition and nothing is ever going to change His condition again, and the Spirit would link us, in a special way, with the sphere of ascension. Elijah, just before his departure, says to Elisha, "Ask what I shall do for thee", and Elisha asks that a double portion of Elijah's spirit be upon him. He wanted the portion of the firstborn, and if Elisha saw him taken it was to be granted to him. This is a beautiful type of ascension and the double portion was linked with that. The Spirit is specially linked with Christ in ascension.
Jesus did not ascend in the condition of flesh and bone but in a body of glory, and that is the body He has as having ascended to the Father. It goes beyond the resurrection condition. In connection with @1 Corinthians 15, "It is raised a spiritual body", the body in which the Lord was seen in resurrection was a spiritual body. We read that He came through closed doors. The Spirit of God uses different terms and we, too, must differentiate. Christ after the flesh did not end at the cross: it was in the grave that Christ after the flesh ended. But He came out of the grave into a new order and He was seen for forty days in that resurrection condition, and yet this did not represent the full thought of God. But now He has gone to the Father, reaching the terminus, and we are His brethren and soon we shall be actually like the ascended One. In His going to the Father there is a Man in heavenly conditions and in a heavenly relationship superlatively great. No other family of saints will ever have this; they will not be conformed to the image of the heavenly One. This should enter into our worship.
In @1 Corinthians 12 Paul speaks of the presence and activity of the Holy Spirit amongst the saints in the place where Christ died. Then in the fifteenth chapter we get the resurrection order followed by the heavenly order. That is
{246}
the line indicated as to the progress in our morning meeting. It is like Solomon's ascent; and if we want to please the Father we must be occupied with the Son ascended to Him in this new condition of manhood. The Father was never so delighted and He will be delighted with us too.
{247}
THE LORD'S THREE APPEARINGS
@John 20:19 - 31; @John 21: 1 - 14
These scriptures give three appearings of the Lord: the first (chapter 20:10 to 23) is in answer to affection and to qualify for privilege and testimony; the second (chapter 20:24 to 29) is to bring a backward disciple into line with the testimony and the third (chapter 21:1 to 14) is to qualify His own for service. All three conditions in the disciples find their answers in the Lord in resurrection.
Mary had been sent with the light of the new relationship and position to the disciples, and they are found together as His "brethren", which means that they loved Him; for everything in John, from chapter 14 especially, depends upon this. Faith does not take us into privilege but affection does. The Lord comes to them, to give them the consciousness of association with Him, in relationship to His Father and His God. This is proper assembly ground. The Lord has given us the Supper, suggested in verse 20, "He showed unto them his hands and his side". We are reminded of His own love in that He gave Himself for the assembly, and of God's love as witnessed by the blood and water from the riven side. Then the Lord comes to take His place in the midst of His own. He sings praises in the assembly. All this is on the line of privilege, and we need to be impressed with the fact that the Lord is the One who leads into this great blessedness. The words of the Lord "Peace be to you" were uttered with a view to their, and our, entering upon privilege.
The second part of this first appearing was the qualifying of His own for testimony; His repetition of "Peace" (verse 26) was with reference to this. Then He breathed into them saying, "Receive the Holy Spirit". What a wonderful thing this is. The very life-breath of the risen Son of God,
{248}
breathed into His own. This would work out in our being here in His Spirit. All this is in view of the testimony of grace. "Whosesoever sins yet remit, they are remitted unto them". This is the abiding testimony of grace which is to mark us continually, not simply for an hour on Lord's Day evening. It is to be our spirit and bearing at all times.
Then the Lord appears to Thomas. Thomas was one who had loved and was devoted to a dead Christ, but he refused the truth of a living Christ in resurrection -- he would in no wise believe. He represents a large class today -- they expect Christ to do great things in the world, but the truth of a living Person outside the world altogether will not be received. However, the Lord had a personal interest in Thomas, in spite of his unbelief, and this is very affecting. The Lord on the second Lord's Day after His resurrection spends time in order to bring Thomas into line with the testimony. The testimony was "My brethren", a circle of those who loved a living Lord and a new relationship, "My Father and your Father, and ... my God and your God". What Thomas, in his foolish unbelief had said, "Unless I see ..." (verse 25) was just the very thing that he needed in order to deliver him and many others like him. What did the nail prints in His hands mean? -- That as to this world the Son of God was a crucified man. What then was the use of wasting energy affection and so on in seeking to improve such a world which had Satan as its god and prince. How we need the lesson of the nail prints. Then what about the riven side? Ah! that was the witness of all the love of God. If the one cuts us off from the world, the other introduces to a new world filled with divine love. Now can it be wondered at that Thomas, having this given him by the Lord, is ready to own, "My Lord and my God".
Chapter 21 is the chapter of service. The Lord comes to the disciples to qualify them for service: "fishing" and "feeding" make up true service. But the disciples had first of
{249}
all to learn their own weakness and nothingness. They had no fish and they had no meat. They had made a great mistake. The Lord had said to them. "I will go before you into Galilee" (@Mark 14:28) and that they should see Him there (@Mark 16:7), there shall ye see me. You would have thought that a man like Peter or John, or any of them would have been there expecting such a blessed sight. But no, "I go to fish" indicated that their service had a prior place in their minds than such privilege. So alas, they must prove their own weakness, but the Lord presents Himself, and the result is that Peter "cast himself into the sea". That is, the man who would endeavour to serve the Lord in the power of natural energy disappeared. The Lord becomes everything for service. The principle of all true service is "Follow me". When the fishes are caught they are brought to the shore, where Jesus is, that is the resurrection shore. All converts should be landed on the resurrection shore. Then they become "lambs" and "sheep" to be fed and shepherded.
{250}
"HIS HANDS AND HIS SIDE"
@John 20:20
"And having said this, he shewed to them his hands and his side". In Luke's gospel we find that the Lord takes everything into His hands on man's behalf. Here in John we find He takes everything into His hands on the Father's behalf. His side indicates the way He came to us; He came by way of death. All that had been put into His hands by the Father could not be brought to us merely by incarnation. It was necessary that He should come by water and by blood. This is emphasised in John's gospel and John's epistle, and is of great importance. The blood is for God; the water is for us. The blood cleanses us in the eye of God. Water is that aspect of the death of Christ applied to us for our cleansing, so that we may be delivered from man in the flesh. We need to be cleansed in our spirits from what we are as in the flesh. Water is the death of Christ applied to the man. The man went in the death of Christ.
We cannot understand what is in His hand unless we understand what is the meaning of His side. If the Lord comes in that way (by water and blood) He can bring in in His hand all that is in the Father's heart; that is what He carries in His hand.
"The Father loveth the Son and hath given all things into His hand" (@John 3:35). That is the key-note of the whole of John's gospel. Everything that the Father wished to have brought to men was put into the hands of the One He loved. And there is now no obstacle, because He came by water and blood. That is the importance of seeing and of understanding the way He came.
Several things come into prominence in the Gospel as being in His hand.
{251}
Chapter 4 speaks of the Spirit. The Father had given the Spirit into His hand that He might give the Spirit to man as Living Water. That is not to meet our need, but it is the outcome of the thought of the Father's love.
The Spirit turns our affection in the direction of eternal life (verse 14). All the action of the Spirit in the believer carries him in the direction of eternal life, so that what is before God's heart is before man's heart, and we are brought into line with the purpose of the love of God. God's love has thought of eternal life for us, and it is a very great thing. Eternal life means complete deliverance from all evil and supreme happiness -- a happiness that no power of evil can ever bring to a termination. It is a question then how far are we in eternal life. @John 17 speaks of His giving life eternal. It is one of all the things given to Him that He might bestow upon man. It is not a question of what we have, but of what is in the hands of the Son of God according to the Father's pleasure, and in His hands for men. In coming to Him and believing on Him we become possessors of these blessed things. There must be personal contact with the Son of God by faith, "We believe on the Son of God".
Besides these two (the Spirit and eternal life) there is sonship (@John 8:35, 36). He is able to confer sonship as put into His hands by the Father. We are not put into the presence of the Father as servants. We might be turned out if that were the case. But a son is there in virtue of an abiding relationship, and we have the freedom of God's house because of having received sonship. It is imparted by the Son -- His own place and relationship. In the epistle to the Galatians it is insisted that the time of sonship has come. We receive it. Everything is on that principle. Christianity is a great system of supply, not of demand. You are brought to everything that is made good in Christ.
In chapter 10:27 and 28 we see that the sheep are in His hands. We can look upon ourselves as the Father's
{252}
property, and He has put us in the hands of the Son. The sheep are held in that hand -- that is their security -- not against judgment in another day, but against all the efforts of men and of the enemy in the present time. He holds the sheep for the Father's pleasure. And we are held secure for the blessed things which are in His hand to bestow. The blessing and the blessed are in His hands. The blessing is kept for me and I am kept for the blessing by the same hand. All this is on the side of divine sovereignty. There is nothing outside of those blessed hands.
"Part with me" (chapter 13, verses 3, 4 and 5). This is another action of His hands. He takes the feet of His saints in His hands and washes them. The object is that we might have "part with me" (verse 8). This is a blessed service of His love, necessary for us, so that we may have the full enjoyment of part with Himself. This washing is not like the cleansing spoken of at the commencement, removing the sinner from before God in the death of Christ, but His service that His own may be fitted to enjoy great nearness to Himself. It is the Lord presenting Himself to us in such a way that we are detached from everything here, so as to enter upon "part with him". He wants His own to have company with Him as the One who has gone to the Father. It is the closest intimacy. If we see the wonderful character of the Person and of what is in His hands, what could be more blessed than to have part with Him where He is gone. By the feet-washing, we get our spirits refreshed. Feet-washing in the east, where sandals are worn, would not simply remove the dust, but would be most refreshing after a journey through the desert. The Lord conveys the thought that He is able spiritually to refresh His people, so that nothing hinders them from joining Him in His own place with the Father. This is the true privilege of the assembly. The Lord brings us together to eat the Supper. When we do so we say that we have no part in this world. Both baptism and the Supper
{253}
mean this. The Supper is partnership with the death of Christ. Well if we have no part here, where is our part? It is with Him who has gone to the Father. He would lead us into the consciousness of the Father's presence. When this is so it is the witness of the blessed activity of His hands. This is true christianity. We must come to Scripture for our conception of it. John's Gospel was written when evil doctrine and practice had come into the assembly, and it gives us what cannot be corrupted, the Son of God and that which is in His hands.
In chapter 17:11 we find He was given the Father's name. The Father gave His name to the Son (@John 17:11) and He brought it for revelation. And this is something far greater than our blessing. It is the name of the source of our blessing. And that blessing is bestowed that we may be free to enjoy the love of the Father, from whom it came. He has a people to whom He can make His name known. It is the name of that sacred Person who loves the Son. The Son prays that they may be kept in it. Let them be wrapped up in the sweetness and blessedness of it.
Then there are the Father's words. He, the Lord, passes them on to His own. They are all those communications which the Father could make to His Son. He could speak freely to Him. The whole Gospel gives them to us. We need to read them in spirit upon our knees. We learn in that way to know the Father and His Son Jesus Christ.
{254}
THE PERSONAL AND MEDIATORIAL GLORY OF THE SON OF GOD
Scripture makes clear that the Son of God is a divine Person, and that His Person is eternal and changeless, whether as subsisting in the form of God, or as come in flesh, or as the subject Son when He gives up the kingdom that God may be all in all. He is for ever "The Same" -- a divine title conveying the thought of eternal immutability. In the beginning He was with God, and was God; He is "I AM". His "goings forth are from of old, from the days of eternity" (@Micah 5:2). There is no question as to this in the mind of any instructed believer on the Lord Jesus Christ.
The glory of the Lord's eternal Person appears in a wonderful way in John's gospel, perhaps more fully than anywhere else. Our spirits are impressed, as we read that gospel, by many statements which bring out the personal greatness and glory of the Sent One: -- "He who comes from above is above all ... . He who comes out of heaven is above all" (3:31), "My Father worketh hitherto and I work" (5:17), "Before Abraham was, I AM" (8:58), "I and the Father are one" (10:30), "All things that the Father has are mine" (16:15). Had He not been truly God as to His Person, He would not have been great enough to take up the work which He came to do as the Sent One, the obedient One. The essential truth of His Person is interwoven with His mediatorship throughout John's gospel. His Person is unchanged, whatever place, service, or relationship He might be pleased to take up for the effectuation of the purposes of divine love.
But over forty times in John's gospel does the Son of God speak of Himself as the Sent One, and this conveys the thought of being entrusted with a mission. Moreover, the word "sent" implies a relative *position* which is not one of absolute equality. It implies authority on the part of the
{255}
sender, subjection on the part of the one sent. To think of our Lord as in Deity being in a place of subjection is derogatory to Him. It is assigning to Him an inferior or subordinate place in Deity, and this is not only contrary to Scripture, but it is inconceivable to any one who believes in His true and full Deity. But as the *Sent One* He was under authority; He was in a subordinate relation to the One who sent Him.
The words of the Son of God in this very gospel confirm this. "Verily, verily, I say to you, The bondman is not greater than his lord, nor the sent greater than he who has sent him", @John 13:16. There is correspondence between the relations in which the bondman stands to his lord and those in which the sent one stands to the sender. If we do not clearly distinguish between the mediatorial glory of the Lord as the Sent One and the glory proper to His Person as in Deity from eternity, we shall lose something of the true character of both. His mediatorial glory derives its lustre from His personal glory, but to make His mediatorial glory the full measure of His personal glory is really derogatory to Him. He was here as the Sent One to do the will of the One who sent Him. He disclaimed coming of Himself; He was the obedient One; carrying out His God-appointed mission here. The very word "sent" indicates His mediatorial place as in manhood. How we delight to look upon Him and recognise Him as the Father's Sent One, the God-given Object of faith for "whosoever"!
"Wherefore coming into the world he says, Sacrifice and offering thou willedst not; but thou hast prepared me a body ... . Then I said, Lo, I come (in the roll of the book it is written of me) to do, O God, thy will", @Hebrews 10: 5 - 7. All was written "in the roll of the book"; it had place in eternal purpose; but it is as "coming into the world" that He actually says, "Lo, I come ... to do, O God, thy will". Obedience or subjection cannot be rightly connected with Him as in "the form of God"; they belong to the condition which the eternal One took up as coming into the world in a prepared body.
{256}
And it is as taking this place that He is the Sent One of the Father. One has only to consider the many passages where the word occurs to see that this is its force. Not to see it is to fail in the apprehension of the mediatorial glory of the Son of God.
It will be obvious to any careful reader that Scripture does not speak of the Lord as "sent" until He was actually here. Even such prophetic scriptures as @Isaiah 42:19 and 61:1 manifestly refer to Him as here. Let any reader look at the scriptures which speak of the Lord as being "sent", and ask himself if they do not derive their force and meaning from the fact that He was actually here? Scripture particularly connects the thought of His being "sent" with His anointing. "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach glad tidings to the poor; he has sent me to preach", @Luke 4:18. This is the order, "anointed" and "sent"; and it corresponds with the "sanctified and sent into the world" of @John 10: 36.
The more we contemplate the Son of God in His mediatorial position the more shall we perceive the infinitude and blessedness of the love of God expressed in the gift of such a Person. He has come within the range of men's apprehension as given by God in love to the world (@John 3:16). Inasmuch as men were sinners and under death He did not stop short of laying down His life for us. Love would have been ineffective if He had not done so, and this could not be when the love was God's love. "Herein as to us has been manifested the love of God, that God has sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son a propitiation for our sins", @1 John 4:9, 10. Our hearts engage themselves believingly and adoringly with the glorious Person of the Son of God; we view Him in holy manhood, and going into death, and we perceive the love of God, for it was God who sent and gave Him. John says, "And
{257}
we have seen, and testify, that the Father has sent the Son as Saviour of the world", @1 John 4:14. He was eternally God, but it is as the Son of God in manhood that He is said to be sent and given. Scripture uniformly presents the truth in this way.
Does this in any way obscure the thought of God sending and giving His Son? On the contrary, it brings out fully the wondrous and blessed fact that the love of God is made known to men in the only way in which it could be made known; that is, mediatorially in His beloved Son as Man on earth. The whole point of the statements of Scripture is to show that the love of God has come into tangible expression. It has been manifested. It could not be known by something taking place in the inscrutable depths of Deity but it was known by the mission and death of the Son of God. He was in the presence of Nicodemus when He spoke of Himself as given by God in love; He was before men's eyes all through John's gospel as the Sent One. And when the hour came for supreme expression to be given to the love of God, that love to men was so great that He did not spare the One who was so holy, so delightful to His heart, so beloved by Him, but delivered Him up for us all. These words, "has not spared" and "delivered him up", did not even apply to Him as in manhood until the wondrous and solemn hour arrived for redemption to be accomplished. I would beg every reader to weigh carefully the statements of Scripture. This is no question of one or two isolated texts; it concerns the whole scope and bearing of the truth. If we have been accustomed to think otherwise, we shall gain spiritually by discarding our own thoughts, and the thoughts of even pious persons, and learning to think and speak as Scripture speaks.
The gospel of John is known to all believers as peculiarly the gospel of the Father and the Son, and the more we consider it the more clearly do we perceive that the relationship
{258}
of Son, even when entered into by a divine Person, corresponds with every thought of that relationship which the Old Testament had made familiar to men. Can any one question that when God created the human relationship of father and son He had in mind the way in which He purposed to make Himself known to men? He provided in that relationship what was suitable to convey to the mind and heart of the creature conceptions of love in authority and of love in obedience which He could use, when the fulness of time came for Him to do so, as a divinely formed setting for the revelation of Himself. The thoughts and affections which by nature and divine ordinance, stood connected with the natural relationship of father and son were not misleading. They were perfectly suited to convey just the thoughts which God intended to fill out in an infinite way when He should be made known as the Father by the presence here on earth of a divine Person standing towards Him in the relationship of Son. How perfectly does Scripture harmonise, and how worthy of God is all seen to be, when we allow Scripture to form our thoughts!
One of the most precious statements of Scripture is that "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared him", @John 1:18. The whole point of this statement is to bring out in the most blessed way the intimate nearness to the Father, the unique place in the Father's affections, of Him who as Man in this world declared the unseen God. What a declaration must that be which is made by One in that relationship, and in such peculiar nearness! The affectionate nature of the declaration could not be more touchingly expressed. It is intended to move our hearts profoundly, and to quicken the affections Godward of all who contemplate it. But it is unquestionable that the declaration was made in time, and to men in this world.
We are afforded full and clear light in Scripture as to the eternal Deity of Christ, and we are also afforded an
{259}
immense amount of instruction in regard of the place and relationship into which He came as the Son of God. It will be found that the teaching of Scripture as to this is everywhere perfectly consistent and uniform. No one who honours Scripture as the word of God can doubt that the Old Testament presentation of what is comely and proper in a son had Christ in view. And the more we read Scripture humbly and reverently, and in prayerful dependence upon God, the more shall we be confirmed in the assurance that it is so. Let us trace this out a little in detail.
We will look first at the scriptures which refer directly in a prophetic way to Christ as Son. @Psalm 2:7 is the most explicit of these, and therefore we do not wonder to find it quoted three times in the New Testament (@Acts 13:33, @Hebrews 1: 5 and 5: 5). Sonship in relation to men naturally is invariably connected in Scripture with the thought of being begotten, and it is definitely connected with this thought in relation to the Son of God. "Jehovah hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; *I* this day have begotten thee". He is also called "a son" in @Isaiah 7:14 and 9:6, and the Spirit of God applies @Hosea 11:1 to Him (@Matthew 2:15). Each of these scriptures gives Him the title of Son as begotten through the power of the Highest overshadowing the virgin (@Luke 1: 35), in which miraculous way a divine Person became incarnate, and was found in man's condition here in holy flesh apart from sin. To apply the words "begotten" or "only begotten" to Him as in eternal Deity in the past is simply a traditional error, for which Scripture does not furnish the slightest ground. John's use of the words (@John 1:18; @John 3:16, 18; and @1 John 4:9) is manifestly in reference to Him as the Object of faith in manhood, and the One sent into the world that we might live through Him.
"Only begotten" as applied to the Lord is not only a term of strong endearment, as some would maintain, but it is so because it expresses a unique relationship, of which
{260}
Isaac's relationship to Abraham was a type. Isaac was Abraham's "only begotten son" (@Hebrews 11:17) because the had no other son who was begotten in the same wonderful way, the child of promise and of resurrection power. One has only to recall the history to be assured of the reason why he should be called "only begotten". The Spirit of God would not take account of any other son of Abraham, for Isaac *alone* was "born according to Spirit" (@Galatians 4:29). But Isaac was truly "begotten" by Abraham. The word "begotten" is definitely used of the Son of God as born in time, and in no other sense is the word ever used of Him.
I may add, at this point, that the two great types of Christ as Son in the Old Testament are Isaac and Solomon. Isaac is, typically, Christ as the Son of His Father's love, begotten and conceived in a power altogether above nature; afterwards, in figure, offered up as a burnt-offering, and raised from the dead, to have a wife of His own kindred. This is Christ viewed particularly, but not exclusively, as saints of the assembly know Him. Solomon is, typically, the anointed King of glory, beloved by Jehovah (@2 Samuel 12:24, 25), and having His kingdom established for ever (@1 Chronicles 17:12 - 14; @1 Chronicles 22:10). This is particularly how Israel and the nations will know "the Son" when He takes the kingdom, and the kings and judges of the earth are called upon to kiss Him (@Psalm 2:12). Rich and full as is the spiritual teaching connected with these types -- a teaching deeply valued by all lovers of Christ -- it is manifest that they both clearly apply to Christ as Man, and not as in the form of God. They do not furnish any suggestion that He bore the title of Son when He was in Deity in the past eternity.
Theologians, feeling that the word "begotten" implied the posteriority of the One begotten to the One who begot Him, but not seeing that it referred to Him as born of the virgin in time, tried to escape the difficulty by inventing the unscriptural phrase, 'eternal generation', which involves the
{261}
serious error that in some way the deity of the Son is derived or communicated from the Father, and is therefore of subordinate character. One would hardly expect any intelligent christian to maintain this now, but it is remarkable how the influence of tradition lingers in the mind.
As we pursue our enquiry into the place which sonship has in Scripture relative to men we find that a son is at the disposal of his father (@Genesis 22:2; @Exodus 22:29, etc.). He is to hearken to his father who begat him (@Proverbs 23:22), and to hear his father's instruction (@Proverbs 1: 8 and many well-known scriptures). A man's son is borne by him as a subject of care (@Deuteronomy 1:31). A father is to command his son and to require obedience; a son is to honour, reverence, and serve his father (see @Exodus 20:12; @Leviticus 19:3; @Malachi 1:6; @Malachi 3:17, and compare @Exodus 4:22, 23). A father is to chasten his son when necessary (@Deuteronomy 8:5 and other passages). Now all these scriptures clearly prove that while the *relationships* of father and son are correlative they are never regarded as being co-equal. To suppose that they are so is to throw into confusion the whole structure of scriptural thought. If a rebellious son refused to hearken to the voice of his father it was so great an evil in God's sight that the penalty was death (@Deuteronomy 21:18 - 21).
Now it is certain that the Son of God was in every way holy, sinless and perfect; and therefore He never knew chastening as corrective of wrong, as the sons of men so constantly need. But every other feature of sonship which the Old Testament brings out was found in perfection in Him. He was begotten of God; He was the subject of God the Father's love and care; He was ever in subjection, carrying out in obedience His Father's will; He was ever instructed (@Isaiah 50:4), and He ever honoured and served His Father. In no part of Scripture does this come out so clearly and fully as in John's gospel, where His full glory as in Deity is set forth so blessedly. He was ever in the place of obedience,
{262}
receiving instruction from the Father as to what He should say and what He should do. He even used the words -- marvellous if we think of the personal greatness of the One who uttered them -- "The Son can do nothing of himself". He received all from the Father; He was ever under the Father's commandment, the object of the Father's love, and abiding in that love as keeping the Father's commandments. All that God could delight in a Son was there in the fullest degree, for He received in gladness of heart all the Father's instruction, and did all that His Father commanded Him to do, fulfilling all His pleasure in service as only such a Son could.
The One who did this was ever *personally* God. Although ever remaining, as to His Person, in the inscrutableness of Deity, without surrendering Its prerogatives, He had taken a subordinate place as Son, for the effectuation of the divine thoughts, and He maintained it throughout. @John 5 brings out in a wonderful way His place of subjection as doing nothing of Himself save whatever He sees the Father doing, and at the same time what He is personally, for whatever things the Father does "these things also the Son does in like manner", "That all may honour the Son, even as they honour the Father". What a wonderful inter-weaving of His personal dignity and His subjection to, and dependence on, the Father!
It is the very perfection and glory of the blessed knowledge of God which is given to men through infinite grace that it comes to us through One who is God, but who came, by a descent of infinite love, into the place and relationship of the Son of God in obedience here.
"*I* will be to him for father, and *he* shall be to me for son" (@Hebrews 1:5) speaks of relationships that differ in kind and character. Many things are true of the one that cannot be said of the other! In a father love is conjoined with care and authority; in a son love is conjoined with obedience and
{263}
service. The relationship of son implies an entirely different attitude from that which is appropriate in a father. How any one can read Scripture without perceiving this, especially after attention has been called to it, is difficult to understand.
We may trace through John's gospel with deep spiritual instruction and blessing how perfectly the Lord is presented in the character suited to a son. His glory was "as of an only-begotten with a father"; He is seen as "in the bosom of the Father", and, as being there, having declared God, whom no one had seen at any time. He is loved as Son by the Father; He is instructed by the Father what to say; He is under the Father's commandment in everything that He does; He serves until all is completed that had been entrusted to Him. He is all to the Father that a Son should be, according to what we learn of sonship in Scripture.
The Jews understood that one who could say that God was his own Father made himself equal with God (@John 5:18). When He said, "I and the Father are one" (@John 10:30), they took up stones to stone Him because He made Himself God. They rightly felt that none but One who was Himself a co-equal divine Person could claim oneness with the Father, or say that God was His own Father. His sonship is of such a character that none but One who was personally co-equal with the Father could have been found in it. It is this which makes the incarnation and sonship of our Lord so surpassingly wonderful. To miss it is to miss the true vision of His glory. One who was eternally God has come into the place and relationship of Son, involving obedience and the keeping of His Father's commandments. But we have no scriptural warrant to carry that relationship into eternal Deity.
The consideration of all this makes it clear that viewed in the relationship of Son our Lord is seen in a subordinate *position*. As in that position He said, "My Father is greater than I", @John 14:28. It is His glory that He should take such
{264}
a place in self-emptying devotion. In the perfection of the place which He took He even said to Jehovah, "Thou art the Lord: my goodness extendeth not to thee", @Psalm 16:2. No man ever gave God the place that He should have with man as He did. A divine Person as Man must be perfect in the place and condition into which He has come in love and obedience, and He could say, "My God" as no other man ever could. God had the place with Him that it was right for God to have with man. In becoming Man He did come into a *place* of inferiority relatively to God and the Father. No christian with scripture before him can doubt this (@Hebrews 2:7, @Philippians 2:7).
But it is of the utmost importance that this word *inferiority*, when applied to the Lord of glory, should be spiritually understood. For a common use of the word to describe what is poor or defective in quality may lead to its use in relation to Him being misunderstood or misrepresented. Inferior properly refers to relative position, and not to the quality of the person who is in it, or to the perfection or otherwise of the way in which he fills it. A. lieutenant is in an inferior position to his captain, though he may be personally and in ability much his superior. The position of a bondman, as such, is inferior to that of his master. The position of man, as such, is inferior to that of God, and is ever so presented in Scripture. The great grace and mystery of the incarnation is that, in self-humiliation and by a descent of infinite love, our Lord has taken a position as Man which is lower than the position which ever belongs to Him as God. He was as perfect in the inferior position of "bondman's form" as He was "in the form of God". It could not be otherwise if we think of who became Man. But features characterized Him as in the inferior position -- such as obedience, dependence, the constant waiting upon the will of another -- which could not be attributed to Him as "in the form of God". As to His Person He is eternally divine, but in becoming Man He has
{265}
come into a place and condition which, in itself, is inferior to the place and condition of Deity. But in Person He is all that He ever was, and thus He is, even as Man, God's Fellow (@Zechariah 13:7). The word inferior, as used in connection with the Lord, applies to the *position* taken, and not to the Person who took it. If we do not admit His coming into a lower or inferior position as becoming Man we have lost the grace of the incarnation.
And all this has its bearing, according to the whole tenor of Scripture, on the Lord's relationship as Son. We have already seen that the relationships of father and son in Scripture, though correlative are never regarded as co-equal. A definite subordination is always attached to the relationship of son, and we see this in its highest and holiest perfection in the gospel of John.
The peculiar blessedness of the present time does not consist only in knowing that there are three Persons in the Godhead, but in seeing the wonderful place which two of those Persons have taken so that God might be declared and known. One of those Persons became Man, so that as the Son of God, He might declare God mediatorially. Another of those Persons condescended to be sent by the Father and the Son, and to indwell those who believe. But the activities of the Son and the Spirit are both subordinated to the purpose of divine love that God should be known as the Father. No one can read the gospels or the epistles without seeing that the thought of God is presented to us in the Father. The Son has made Him known mediatorially, and the Spirit is sent and given so that His love may be shed abroad in the hearts of believers, and that they may, as having the Spirit of sonship, cry, "Abba, Father".
It is not that the Son or the Holy Spirit are subordinate in Deity. Such a thought would be grossly wrong. But they have been pleased to take a subordinate *place* in the economy of revelation. And that is why we do not get in
{266}
Scripture such expressions as "God the Son", or "God the Holy Spirit", but we do get habitually "God the Father". "To us there is one God, the Father", @1 Corinthians 8:6. The Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God, and this in the most absolute sense. But the Son and the Spirit have been pleased to take a relative place which is not commensurate with Their full personal glory, but which is essential to the accomplishment of the purposes of divine love. The Son has been seen in manhood in a subordinate and subject place, not acting by His own will, or speaking His own words, or doing His own works. The Holy Spirit is also known as in a subordinate place, not speaking from Himself, but speaking "whatsoever he shall hear". Both the Son and the Holy Spirit are rendering Their wonderful service in order to bring about the knowledge of God as the Father.
God was declared, and the Father's name made known, by the Son as Man on earth, who was at that very time "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father", @John 1:18. It was the relation in which God stood to Him, and God had never been Father in the same sense to any man before. Of course there is no change in God; what He is now He ever was and ever will be. But He was not known to any man as Father until the Man was here who was "called the Son of God". He was not known as such, nor could be. This is a question, not of what God is essentially in His inscrutable Being, but of how He is pleased to be known by men. When the Son was here as Man, God was declared in the full height and glory of all that was possible for the creature to know; His name as Father was made known. There is no further revelation to be made; all is out that can be made known of God. It has been well said, 'Who can speak after the Son?' The names Father and Son are ever presented in Scripture in relation to the divine mediatorial system. They belong to the sphere of revelation, and not to that of God's essential Being which no creature mind can ever know. We
{267}
know God as the Father now, which no saints ever did before He stood in that relation to a blessed Man in this world, His own beloved Son.
The whole of the Lord's ministry amongst His own was to the end that they should recognise that the Father was the source of all that came out in, or was accomplished by, His mission here. The Father was the starting point from which He moved, the One by whom He was sent, and to whom He went when His mission was fulfilled. He would have His own to connect everything with the Father; it was His joy to say of them, "Now they have known that all things that thou hast given me are of thee; for the words which thou hast given me I have given them, and they have received them, and have known truly that I came out from thee, and have believed that thou sentest me", @John 17:7, 8. All this clearly views our Lord as in a mediatorial position.
Our knowledge of God as declared by the Son, and as known by the holy name of Father, is dependent on the incarnation. This has introduced a stupendous change; it has brought about an entirely new beginning in the knowledge of God, and is so presented in Scripture (@1 John 1:1; @1 John 2:13, 14). And in connection with it the Father is known as the blessed Source of everything that came out mediatorially in the Son. It is the pleasure of divine Persons that it should be so. And now that God is made known as the Father we can speak of Him by that blessed name, and Scripture speaks of Him thus, even when, referring to the past eternity. Divine names and titles, when known, are used in Scripture to identify the Persons without necessarily meaning that they were so known in the conditions referred to. For instance, "Christ" and "Christ Jesus" are used in speaking of Him in the past eternity, but we all know that He was not actually the anointed Man then. He was not actually "the Son of man" before His incarnation, but the Person who is now known as the Son of man was from eternity, and is now ascended up
{268}
where He was before (@John 6:62). God told Moses (@Exodus 6:3) that He was not made known to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob by the name Jehovah, and yet that name is used throughout the book of Genesis, and even by Jehovah Himself. It is evident that the one true God -- Israel's Jehovah -- was identified by the name.
So in the New Testament God is spoken of as "the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ" (@Ephesians 1:3), who "has chosen us in him before the world's foundation". Every thoughtful believer must realise that He could not be *the God* of another divine Person when both are in absolute Deity. But as having come in flesh the Lord Jesus could not only say "My Father", but also "My God". He was in the place of man relative to God, as He was also the Son in relationship to God and to the Father. "The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ" is God as known in relation to the Lord Jesus Christ at the present time, but He is also so named when the reference is to Him at a period when such a title could not apply. The Persons of the Godhead are eternally the same, though in divine wisdom they may be known now by names which did not apply even in Old Testament times. And if they did not apply in Old Testament times, how can we say that they applied eternally when there was no revelation at all? The fact is that we only know divine Persons as and when they are made known to us, and we speak of Them as we know Them. But names of revelation were certainly not needed within the sphere of Deity. That is a region utterly beyond creature apprehension; and it is our wisdom to recognise that the greatness of God is unsearchable (@Psalm 145:3), and to be content with the blessed light which has come to us in infinite love. We shall find enough in it to engage and fill our hearts adoringly for time and throughout eternity.
Scripture is almost entirely occupied in bringing before us how God has been pleased to be known by men at different
{269}
periods, and how He is pleased to be known by men at the present time. At certain times God was pleased to be known by certain names. Those names gave character to the knowledge and faith of His people, but they could not go beyond what was made known of God in those names. The Patriarchs did not know Him by the name 'Jehovah', and no Old Testament saints knew Him by the name of 'Father'. His NAME is how He is pleased to be known by men, and it has always been in keeping with what faith needed for its support at any particular time. We know Him now as the Father, but it would be misleading for us to say that He was always the Father. He was not so known by His saints of old; their whole knowledge of Him was formed by other names. We cannot carry the names Father and Son even back into the Old Testament. We find God is known there as Elohim, the Most High, the Almighty, and Jehovah. We have a prophetic "decree" declared in @Psalm 2 that the Messiah, Jehovah's Anointed, would be His Son, begotten by Him on a certain day. But 'the Father' as a name of revelation was held in reserve until there was a divine Person here on earth as Man known as the Son of God.
The Son, as a divine Person in manhood, speaking to the Father in the wondrous prayer of @John 17, refers to a glory which He shared, and a love of which He was the object, prior to His incarnation, and, indeed, before the world was (verses 5, 24). The glory and the love were His as in eternal Deity. There is an unrevealed depth about this, and about the glory which He has now along with the Father according to @John 17:5, which we cannot fathom. Scripture does not say that this glory of His in the past eternity was the glory of sonship, though it was undoubtedly a glory proper to His eternal Person.
He descended from the glory which He had along with the Father before the world was when He came down into a condition and path of humiliation in order to complete the
{270}
work given Him that He should do it, but in @John 17:5 He asks to be glorified with it as Man. A divine Person could not remain in humiliation, but having come into that place He would not leave it by His own act, but as being glorified by the Father whom He had glorified in humiliation. He is now glorified as Man along with the Father, and the glory which He has with the Father is the same as He had before the world was. This is more intimate and personal than the exaltation of @Philippians 2:9 - 11. There it is the public answer on the part of God the Father to the self-humbling and obedience unto death of Jesus Christ. Every knee of heavenly and earthly and infernal beings shall bow to Him, every tongue will confess that He is Lord to God the Father's glory. It is not a return to a glory possessed before, but the granting of a name that shall be supreme in the whole sphere of good and evil. But @John 17:5 refers to a glory previously possessed, from which He had come to take up His mediatorial service in humiliation, but with which He is now glorified along with the Father. What joy to the Father thus to glorify Him! To answer the completeness of His work by receiving Him, wholly apart from humiliation, in the fulness of a glory which was His before He became Man! For a brief space He had descended from it to be in humiliation here, but now He is with the Father as man invested with the glory which was His previous to His incarnation. This is more than the glory of sonship, for He was glorified as the Son of God while He was here, both by the Father's voice and by the resurrection of Lazarus (@John 11: 4).
The Father has glorified Him (@John 17:5) so that it is, and will be, manifest to the intelligent universe that He is no less in personal glory now than He was before the foundation of the world. His self-emptying, in coming into a place of obedience and in taking a bondman's form, was publicly a descent from His proper and essential glory. But He is now glorified along with the Father in a condition which was not
{271}
His before. As Man He is invested with the glory that was His before the world was. I repeat, there is an unrevealed depth about this which bows the soul in worship. Indeed we worship Him as "over all, God blessed for ever". And that blending of what is personal with what is mediatorial which we have seen to characterise the gospel of John will be carried on through eternity. The personal place and glory of the Son will give a peculiar lustre to His eternal subjection (@1 Corinthians 15:28).
Our Lord's precious designation, "The Word", brings out how the mind of God has been fully and intelligibly communicated in Him. "God having spoken in many parts and in many ways formerly to the fathers in the prophets, at the end of these days has spoken to us in the person of the Son" (@Hebrews 1:1, 2). All was truly there in the divine mind from eternity, but the wonder and glory of the present time is that it has come into expression. The Greek "Logos" (Word) signifies this. A competent scholar has defined its meaning thus: "Whatever is the expression of a thought formed in the mind, and otherwise unknown; hence used for the thing *expressed*, or the expression of it ... . It is the matter and form of thought and expression, as well as the utterance of it ... . Whatever expresses the mind is *logos*. *Nous* is the intelligent faculty: whatever expresses the thought formed in it is *logos*" (J.N.D. in note to @1 Corinthians 1:5 in Darby Translation: see the whole note). What should arrest attention is that God, and all that is in His mind relative to men, has come into expression so as to be intelligently apprehended. Nothing could be more wondrous.
The title "The Word" conveys to us what Christ the Son is as the glorious Person in whom is expressed the mind and heart of God. It is thus a very distinctive and comprehensive appellation, as perhaps covering a wider and more profound apprehension of Him than any other title that attaches to Him. It is not a name of relationship like Son; not
{272}
an official title like the Christ; but it is a designation which indicates the greatness of what is expressed in Him. The blessedness of God was in perfect expression in Him, and this is greater than anything else. It involves His full Deity in perhaps a more absolute way than any other of His titles. Who could be the full expression of God, and of God's mind, save One who was Himself an eternal divine Person? Hence John, writing by inspiration of the Spirit, selects this appellation to designate Him as being "In the beginning". Some title must be used, and we may be sure that "The Word" was more suitable to be used in that connection than any other. But John writes, as Luke does also, from the standpoint that the Word had been known as having become flesh, and dwelling among men. Men had been privileged to be "eye-witnesses of and attendants on the Word" (@Luke 1:2).
If Luke and John had not thus known the Word neither of them would ever have written gospels: Christ had become known as "The Word" to these two blessed men of God. Doubtless to thousands of others, but these *two* witnesses will suffice to prove that He was known to men, and spoken of by men, as "the Word". Now John has told us, by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, that the Person thus known, and thus spoken of, was with God and was God. But it was One known to John, and many others, as "The Word", who was in the beginning, and who was with God and was God. This is the whole point of what is stated. It is the assertion in unmistakable terms of the pre-existence and Deity of Him who is now known to us as the Word. To say that He was the Word in eternity only raises questions as to *what* was expressed in Him in eternity, and *to whom* it was expressed; questions impossible to answer, for Scripture is silent on the matter. But the certainty that the One now known as the Word was eternally God is of the greatest and most vital importance. It bows the soul before Him in most profound
{273}
reverence, and intensifies the desire that the vast import of His title "The Word" shall be known now in spiritual reality and power in our hearts. There is immense gain in this, and I am sure that the enemy would, if possible, divert us from it by any and every means.
Creation made known God's eternal power and divinity; these are invisible things, but they are apprehended by the mind through the things that are made. But *the mind* of God, what He is morally and in His nature, was not spoken in creation. It was spoken in Christ incarnate, and it was known to the saints as having been spoken in Him. But in face of the enemy's efforts to obscure the truth they needed to know the Personality and Deity of the Word. This was declared in simple but unmistakable language. His eternal Being, His Deity, His distinct Personality, His action as universal Creator, are established unquestionably. All this was true of Him whom we know as the Word. Is He not seen to be invested with ineffable divine majesty and glory? Is anything taken from Him by saying that the intelligible expression in Him of every divine thought was in manhood, and that it awaited His incarnation to be expressed? And that the *expression* of it is involved in the very word Logos? I have enlarged somewhat on this because of its importance in view of an intelligent apprehension of the truth.
@Hebrews 1 is quite in line with this. God having spoken to us in the Person of the Son is clearly in manhood, but God is pleased to tell us that by the same Person He made the worlds. It is of the very substance of the faith that the Son -- the very One who has been known and heard in manhood -- was the Creator. Scripture establishes this beyond question. But creation was brought into being by Him when He was in the form of God; it was long before God spoke in Him as Son in manhood. But by the same Person He made the worlds.
@Hebrews 1 was written to assert the Deity of the Son,
{274}
the Messiah, and, amongst other scriptures, @Psalm 45 is cited to show that the King, the Beloved, God's anointed One, is addressed prophetically as "O God". The psalm is wholly prophetic of Messiah's glory, when as God's Anointed He will subdue His enemies and wield the sceptre of His kingdom in righteousness. It has been said to Him prophetically, but the things said to exist (such as the subjugation of enemies, the establishment of the throne, and the place of the king's daughter and the queen) are all obviously future. But the King of that glorious day is the blessed Person spoken of in @Hebrews 1 as The Son. It is in manhood that God spoke by Him, and it is as Man He set Himself down on the right hand of the greatness on high. It is as Man that He is addressed by God as His Son; as Man He will be brought into the habitable world as Firstborn, and worshipped by all, God's angels; as Man He will have the millennial throne and sceptre. But that Man is God, and is addressed as God. His eternal Deity is unquestionable, but the subject of @Hebrews 1:5 - 13 is the greatness and Deity of the Messiah -- God's anointed Man -- as set forth in Old Testament scriptures.
I will now, in conclusion, remark briefly on several scriptures which seem to be regarded by some as proofs that the sonship of Christ was eternal. @Hebrew 7:3 is one of them. Melchisedec was clearly a type of Christ as King and Priest, a type which will be fulfilled in the millennial kingdom. It is after his order, too, that Christ is now a Priest for ever as sitting at God's right hand until His enemies are put as footstool of His feet (@Psalm 110). But let it be carefully noted that it is to the earth-rejected, throne-seated Messiah that Jehovah swears "and will not repent, Thou art priest for ever after the order of Melchisedek". It is the Son born in time according to @Hebrews 5:5, perfected through suffering (@Hebrews 5:9), and now "a Son perfected for ever" (@Hebrews 7:28), who is constituted Priest. He has not glorified Himself to be
{275}
made a high priest (@Hebrews 5:5); if He were on earth He would not even be a priest at all (@Hebrews 8:4). But now as the glorified Man at God's right hand He is a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec; He has been "addressed by (or saluted of) God" as invested with this office evermore.
The priesthood of Christ is the subject of @Hebrews 5 to 8. The Deity of the Son having been fully established in chapter 1, the Spirit of God proceeds to bring before us His priestly office, an office which is conferred upon Him as Man exalted at God's right hand by the swearing of an oath by God. He did not derive His priesthood from any ancestor, nor will He transmit it to any successor. It thus differs essentially from the priesthood as held by Aaron and his sons. It is the priesthood of the Son of God, an abiding priesthood "according to power of indissoluble life", exercised by One who "because of his continuing for ever, has the priesthood unchangeable", @Hebrews 7:24. The "indissoluble life" of verse 16 is clearly life in resurrection.
It pleased God that Melchisedec should be a remarkable type of this order of priesthood long before the law constituted men high priests. "Now consider how great this personage was, to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth out of the spoils". It thus appeared that Melchisedec's priesthood was superior to any priesthood exercised by the sons of Levi, for in Abraham Levi was made to pay tithes to a greater priest. The priests of Aaron's line were dying men (@Hebrews 7:8), but Melchisedec was one "of whom the witness is that he lives". The record of Scripture says nothing of how he came on the scene, or of how he departed; Scripture brings him before us as a living priest, as one who "abides a priest continually". He was thus a fitting type of Christ. The whole point of the teaching of this part of Hebrews is that the Son of God is *now* "a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec", who was typically assimilated to Him.
{276}
@Hebrews 7:3 is very interesting as showing how what Scripture does *not* say of a typical person may have an important bearing on what is typified in him. The omission of any mention of parentage or genealogy in the case of Melchisedec, and his being said to have "neither beginning of days nor end of life", may serve to suggest in a striking, if somewhat mysterious, way that the One typified in him would be a divine Person. This would be in keeping with what is certainly one chief object of the Spirit of God in this wonderful epistle. That is, to make unmistakably clear to the Hebrew believers that Jesus, the Messiah, the Son of God is a divine Person. The divine speaking in Him, His heirship of all things, His creatorial power, His session on the right hand of the greatness on high, His throne in the kingdom, His ability to set aside the whole created system, His place as Son over the house of God, all proclaim Him a divine Person. And if we think of His priesthood who but a divine Person could pass down through the heavens, or become "higher than the heavens"? Who but a divine Person could sit down "on the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens", or could find an eternal redemption, or be the Testator of all that is in the heart of God? Who but a divine Person could be equal to the effectuation of all that is in the will of God, or could be "the same yesterday, and today, and to the ages to come"? But this eternal divine Person is known to us as having become Man, and as bearing the title of Son in manhood.
It has also been asserted that as Scripture speaks of "the eternal Spirit" (@Hebrews 9:14) it justifies our speaking of Christ as 'the eternal Son'. The fact of such an argument being advanced shows how difficult it is to find any scriptural warrant for the latter statement. And if attention is given to the connection and bearing of the passage it will be obvious that no such deduction from it is admissible. That we should be told that Christ "by the eternal Spirit offered
{277}
himself spotless to God" (@Hebrews 9:14) is a precious witness to our hearts of how everything in His public service, even to the offering of Himself to God, was done by the Holy Spirit. But how this can be supposed to prove that the title "Son" attached to Him in the past eternity will, I think, be difficult for most readers to understand.
No scripture could bring out more distinctly than @Hebrews 9:14 the place that Christ was in here as not acting by His own will, or by His own power as a divine Person. His offering of Himself to God was the supreme act of His self-sacrificing devotion, but it was performed through the eternal Spirit, and was thus connected with the eternal thoughts of God. It stood in relation to what was in God's mind long before the types of the Old Testament set it forth in a figurative way. Compare @1 Peter 1:20. "The eternal Spirit" was long prior to the offering of goats and bulls. The latter only sanctified to the purifying of the flesh, but what was done by Christ through the eternal Spirit effected what was in accord with the mind of God, and therefore was of an eternal character. It has long been recognised that the use of the word "eternal" in the epistle to the Hebrews contrasts what God has brought in now, through Christ and by His death, with what was known in Judaism.
The Spirit is not a name of relationship like Father or Son. The Holy Spirit has not been manifested like the Son, or revealed like the Father; He remains in His eternal character as an unseen Spirit, and can therefore be spoken of as "the eternal Spirit". But Scripture does not speak of 'the eternal Father', or 'the eternal Son', because the Father and the Son are names which give character to our *present* knowledge of God. They are names which could only be known through the incarnation. They give a character to the present time which no other period ever had. The peculiar blessedness and supreme favour of the present time is that we know the Father as revealed in the Son. Let the saints of
{278}
God watch diligently that they be not diverted from the apprehension of how divine Persons are known now through the incarnation of the blessed Son of God.
@Proverbs 30:4 is another of the passages which are supposed by some to support the idea that the sonship of our Lord goes back into eternity. But this verse forms part of an utterance which is distinctly spoken of as a "prophecy" (verse 1). It may be, like other Old Testament scriptures we have referred to, a prophetic intimation of the sonship of our Lord Jesus Christ. @Psalm 2 had probably already found its place in inspired Scripture before Agur's prophecy was uttered; at any rate it was another utterance by the same prophetic Spirit. And @Proverbs 30:4 no more proves that the title "Son" applied to Christ *then* than @Psalm 2:7 proves that He was the Son begotten, and anointed as King upon Zion, at the time when the psalm was written. It would make nonsense of Scripture to assume that prophetic statements as to what Christ would be could be taken as setting forth facts subsisting as actualities at the time when they were written.
The inquiry, "What is his son's name; if thou knowest", was, indeed, designed to awaken in the heart of every reader deep interest in the fact that One who could be spoken of as God's Son was in the view of the prophetic Spirit. And I think we should be justified in saying that the same divine Spirit who inspired the question has answered it in @Isaiah 9:6. "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name is called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace". But it is obvious that nothing whatever is said in @Proverbs 30:4 about His being Son in the past eternity.
As much has been made of @Proverbs 8 as being alleged to prove the eternal sonship of Christ, it is important to consider the scripture carefully. It is clear that Wisdom is
{279}
personified here, and so also is Prudence. But the thought of Wisdom being the Son is in no way suggested in the chapter, for Wisdom is personified as a woman. This is striking as being in a book which *does* give prominence to the thought of sonship in the saints. But Wisdom is always in the feminine; it is "her" and "she" all through. The son -- "my son" -- is to get wisdom; he is to say to wisdom "Thou art my sister"; intelligence is to be his kinswoman (chapter 7:4). An attempt has been made to evade the force of this by pointing out that wisdom is a feminine word in Hebrew. But no one could believe that the Spirit of God would use a feminine word, and a feminine figure throughout, if His object had been to give in @Proverbs 8 an unquestionable proof that the Lord Jesus Christ bore the title of 'Son' in the past eternity. There are feminine types of Christ in Scripture such as the red heifer and other female offerings, and the import of these must be sought in the general idea which is conveyed typically by the female. That idea is certainly not the thought of sonship. The Holy Spirit has emphasised the sonship of Christ in one remarkable passage by speaking of Him as "a male son" (@Revelation 12:5), and if @Proverbs 8 had been intended to be one of the strongest proofs that Scripture contains of the eternal sonship of Christ we may be sure that the chapter would not have carried throughout the feminine impress.
The fact is that Wisdom is viewed in the chapter in a very abstract way; she dwells with prudence, and she is intelligence; by her kings rule, rulers make just decrees, and princes and nobles rule. She dispenses honour to those who love her, and fills their treasuries. Jehovah possessed her in the beginning of His way; she was set up from eternity, brought forth before the hills, and was present when Jehovah did the work of creation. The language used -- "set up", "brought forth" -- is clearly inapplicable to a divine Person in eternal Deity, but it is beautifully in keeping with the thought of wisdom as a personified quality brought into
{280}
being, and existing beside Jehovah, His hand-maid, as it were, in all His workings. She is not said to be created; that would make her a concrete entity; but she is "set up" and "brought forth" so as to be contemplated as possessed by Jehovah. It is obviously an abstract conception of wisdom, but personified, so that it is represented as crying, instructing, loving, being loved, conferring benefits, and as rejoicing before Jehovah and in the habitable parts of His earth, and as having delights with the sons of men. In all this I have no doubt there was in the mind of the Spirit a certain reference to Christ, for it was He who would be God's wisdom as well as His power, even as the crucified One, and who would be "made to us wisdom from God" (@1 Corinthians 1:24, 30). But to make wisdom in @Proverbs 8, to be definitely Christ personally is going beyond what is written. Indeed, as we know, Christ the Son was really Jehovah the Creator in @Proverbs 8, and wisdom was with Him in all His works of old. To see this is manifestly to exalt Him infinitely; it is impossible for any one to say that it is a derogation from His glory.
I do not think that @Proverbs 8 can be understood, consistently with the whole truth, except by seeing that it is the voice of wisdom abstractly viewed, but personified as a female who can speak, love, bestow favours, and have delights. It has pleased God to so present it, and it is for us to seek understanding as to it. It must be admitted by all that the thought of Son is simply not to be found there. @Proverbs 8 does not call wisdom a divine Person, and some of the language used precludes this thought of her.
Finally, we may briefly consider the bearing of @Matthew 28:19 on this subject. "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptising them to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit".
This great utterance of our risen Lord brings the three Persons of the ever blessed Trinity into view as They are known now through the incarnation. Such a formula could
{281}
not have been used in Old Testament times. It required that God should be known as the Father, and this was through another divine Person having come here as Man. And He who was here as Man had also spoken of another divine Person who would be sent from the Father and from Himself as a glorified Man, to abide with and be in those who should believe on His name. That is, the whole scope of the truth as to God, as it has come to light through infinite grace and love by the incarnation of the Son, and as a result of His death and exaltation, is brought to all disciples now, and they are brought to it, in the sacred formula of @Matthew 28:19. Nothing could be more profound, and yet nothing more simple. The Father has been made known by the Son as a divine Person in manhood. The Holy Spirit is known as One sent by the Father and the Son. But if Christ had not been here as the Son in manhood there could be no baptising to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. This is how divine Persons are known now to us men through the incarnation; the death, resurrection, and exaltation of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the gift of the Holy Spirit, being bound up with it. The whole point and force of the baptismal formula is that men are to be baptised to a name which is now made known. Certainly there was no baptising in the past eternity, nor do we gain anything whatever by carrying back into eternity a formula which derives all its significance from the supremely blessed and all-important fact that one Person in the Godhead has become, and remains eternally, Man.
I do not think that any scripture can be adduced that applies the title "Son", or "Son of God", to our Lord Jesus Christ as in Deity in the past eternity. Scripture teaches unquestionably that His *Person* is eternal, but it invariably attaches these *titles* to Him, whether prophetically or actually, as in manhood. This is, I believe, indisputable.
I have found the review of this great and holy subject,
{282}
and the re-consideration of the precious scriptures bearing on it, to be very profitable. I trust that all who read this little paper may derive a like blessing. Everything that concerns the personal and mediatorial glory of the Son of God is of deep interest to those who love Him. I have sought to bring out what Scripture really says; this will, I trust, edify and enlarge, and make the Person of the Son of God greater and more precious in the heart of every reader.
