HARMONY  --  GOD KNEW THE END FROM THE BEGINNING
@Genesis 2: 7 - 10; @Revelation 22: 1 - 5
There is one thing I think must strike the most casual reader of Scripture and that is God knew the end from the beginning. You see the first page of Scripture and the last are in perfect harmony with each other. We get the tree of life and the river in @Genesis 2 and the tree of life and the river in @Revelation 22. Now that shows me from the beginning to the end God has the same things before Him. God does not change His ways. His dispensations may change but God does not.
In @Genesis 1 we have a picture of the work of God in connection with His counsels. You may say it is a picture of creation, but it is a wonderful picture of God's work which leads right on to the rest of God. The beginning of Genesis gives a description of the work of the six days, and it ends with the sabbath of rest, and it is thus a picture of the end to which God is really working. He is working up to a certain point and that is to secure rest and satisfaction for Himself in the full blessing of man. Depend upon it, that is God's object. In chapter 2 we come to the unfolding of God's ways. God has been pleased to take certain ways in order to reach His end, and in the ways of God it was necessary that man, God's creature, should be the subject of testing. I think that is very plain. When God made man He put him in the garden of Eden to test him.
People get strange ideas of what a beautiful place the garden of Eden was but, though that garden was a beautiful place, it was a place of testing and was intended to be so. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil was there and it was
{4}
forbidden them. It was the test of man's obedience and confidence in God and the penalty of death was attached to disobedience. So that the garden of Eden, beautiful as it was, was a place of testing for man, and I suppose everybody can see that when man was thus tested he turned out a complete failure through disobedience, and thus fell under the power of sin and came under death as the judgment of God. And then when God was pleased to set up government and put the sword of government in the hand of Noah after the flood, man despised His government, and when God gave him His law he broke it, and when He sent prophets man evilly treated them, and when He last of all sent His Son, Him they rejected and crucified. And now that He causes His gospel to be preached in this world, what do men do with it? They resist the Holy Spirit and will not receive the glad tidings of the grace of God. God is testing man from the beginning to the end and the result of the test is that at every point man turns out a complete failure.
Now I do not know whether that is the conclusion come to by everyone here, but with that book in your hand how can you come to any other? At every part of man's history he is an utter failure. The test began in the garden of Eden and is still going on, and that test is not the law but Christ. The question for everyone is, "What think ye of Christ?" They who believe on Him are the children of God, and the rest are accursed. You know there is a solemn scripture connected with the gospel, "If any one love not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be Anathema Maranatha" (@1 Corinthians 16: 22). There is only one of two things for the sinner; if he will not have the blessing he must have the curse. And why not be blessed? Because they love the world and love to have their own way and will not submit themselves to God. But the end of this is death. Death comes in as the result of the testing of man. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil was forbidden, and forbidden because man was not fit to touch it. It was too great a matter for man to touch, and God knew very well if man attempted to touch the question of good and evil he
{5}
would involve himself in utter ruin, so God forbad it. Well, they disobeyed God and the result has been a world of sin and sorrow and death; and the world is established thus, as it were, under God's eye today. That is the result of the testing of man. He has plunged himself, and we have all plunged ourselves into sin and death and Satan's power.
Now let me say there were two things in the garden not connected with the testing of man; they had a place on another line altogether. The first was the tree of life and the second was the river. These had nothing to do with the testing of man. They were symbolical of what was in the mind of God; and I do not think it can be difficult in the mind of any Christian to see that the tree of life was a figure of Christ. I think it is equally clear that the river was typical of the Holy Spirit. So that on the first page of Scripture we see in emblem Christ and the Spirit as God's provision for man.
I do not see there could have been much meaning in the tree of life for Adam in innocence. I do not think it could have meant anything to him. What would be the good of the tree of life to a man not under death? It seems to me the tree of life could only have its place when sin and death had come in, and not before. But it is very interesting to see that before man had come under sin and before he is tested, God had a provision in His own mind that was in store for man against the time when sin and death should come in. And I believe, beloved friends, the whole of Scripture is the history of how God has brought in Christ and the Spirit that there might be infinite blessing for man, and at the same time real satisfaction and rest for God. And I think we get the climax in @Revelation 22. There you get the tree in the midst of the street of the city and of the river, and the river of the water of life flowing out from the throne of God and of the Lamb. That is the climax. It is a picture of the garden of Eden; when worked out in all its blessed fulfilment you get the tree and the river again.
Now, if we see really the consequences of Adam having eaten of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, we shall
{6}
find the thought of the tree of life very precious. And I do not think anyone would think much of the tree of life until he had realised what was meant by the other tree. You see sin came in in connection with the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and death by sin, and not only that, but Satan's power. People do not think of it, but it is a reality that Satan is the god and prince of this world. They think as they look at members of parliament and cabinet ministers that they are ordering everything as they like; but there is a secret invisible power behind the scenes moving everything in this world, and that power is the power of Satan. The Lord spoke of him as the prince of this world; and Paul calls him the god of this world, and he speaks of him as the ruler of the authority of the air, and the spirit that works in the sons of disobedience. A man thinks he is doing his own will, but he is not; he is doing Satan's will and using the power of Satan. Now these facts have to be recognised. Sin has come in and death by sin, but people regard death as a natural event; it is the most unnatural event possible to happen. To call it the course of nature is an abominable lie and a libel upon God. Not a bit of it! It is the judgment of God upon sin. People do not die in the course of nature but under the judgment of God. "The wages of sin is death". God never created man to be a dying man; death came in by sin. Sin has come in and death has come in and Satan's power has come in. Now we are all involved in this matter; every one of us is deeply affected because sin has come into the world.
A young man once said to an old Christian, 'I have found original sin in the Bible'. The old man replied, 'Have you found it in your own heart?' Now we have found sin in our own heart and not only in the Bible, and we have come under death and as children of Adam we have fallen under Satan's power. Why I dwell on this is to show that before Christ could be the tree of life for us and before we could receive the Spirit which answers to the river, this terrible question must be settled, the question of sin and death and Satan's power. These things must be settled.
{7}
Beloved friends, I do not know whether they are settled for you or not, but I know they are settled for God; and the way they have been settled is such that the full blessing of it is available for us. Christ is the tree of life, and He is that after settling every question that came in by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. How was it done? Take the question of sin; that is the first point. I found myself as a natural man in company with Simon Peter in @Luke 5 crying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord" (@Luke 5: 8). Mark that word "sinful". How ready people are to say, 'Oh yes, we are all sinners', but how few have the sense of being a "sinful" man  --  full of sin. Now how is that to be met? Why, only by Christ: it can only be met by a holy sacrifice; and Christ, God's beloved Son, came into this world, born of the virgin, born in holy flesh, that He might go to the cross and be made sin, and in His sacrifice put it away. Has it been accomplished? Yes, blessed be God, it has. There has been a sacrifice offered, atonement made, and the benefit of it is open for every sinner in this world.
And then take death; you see, death has come in through sin. Well, we could not meet it. It is no use talking of meeting death. Suppose you had all the medical men with all the medical science in the world: ask them if they can meet the question of death and set it aside? Why, they would laugh at you. But Christ has come into the world and gone into death and has tasted death for every thing. The Son of the blessed God, upon whom death had no claim, for He was without sin, and hence over Him death could have no power, for He was the Prince of life, He has come into this world and tasted death for every thing. What a wonderful thing! The very judgment that rested upon you and upon me has been taken in love by the Lord Jesus Christ.
And what about Satan's power? There is the universal power of Satan. Has Christ been able to deal with that? Yes, He has. In @Genesis 3 God says, 'The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head'. No one can meet Satan but Christ. You know there is a great deal of wickedness in the
{8}
way people speak of Satan  --  even among Christians. People speak of him in a frivolous way and in a very light way that they would be afraid to do if they knew what a great dignitary he is. You know the archangel Michael would not bring against him a railing accusation (@Jude 9). There is only one Person who could bruise the serpent's head, and that is Christ. He came into this world and into the place of sin, and was there to bruise the serpent's head. True, the serpent bruised His heel; but at that very moment his head was crushed beneath that victorious heel. Thus Christ has annulled him that had the might of death, that is the devil, and broken the power of Satan for ever. Beloved friends, that is why Satan is not god and prince in my heart and has no possession there, because the One who has broken his power has a place there; and that is the only way Satan is displaced. It is by Christ coming in.
Now you see when these things came in by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, sin, death and Satan's power were all met by Christ going into death, and now Christ in resurrection is the tree of life. Mark that, it is Christ in resurrection. It is in resurrection that Christ is really precious to a sinner. When Christ was on earth the question of sin was not settled, nor the question of death and Satan's power. But after He had been to the cross, He came back in triumph, and it is really in resurrection that He becomes the tree of life.
As the scripture says, life and incorruptibility were brought to light through the gospel (@2 Timothy 1: 10), through a risen Christ. Beloved friends, what a joy it is to think that Christ is the tree of life! I am not now burdened by the thought of sin.
I see Christ having come into death and been raised again by the glory of the Father; all the power of Satan was broken at the cross, and the One who broke that power is now known by faith in my heart as the tree of life. What a wonderful thing to see that risen Person! Christ is the wisdom and the power of God.
You may remember in @Proverbs 3: 18 we read, "She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her; and happy is he
{9}
that retaineth her". Christ is the wisdom of God to meet sin and death and Satan's power, and as I lay hold on Christ, I lay hold really upon the tree of life. It is such a wonderful thing to have a Person outside yourself! Many a true Christian is looking inside half his time, but if you begin to look inside you are sure to get dull and down in your soul and into darkness. It is a great thing to keep the eye on Christ. Christ is the tree of life, Christ in resurrection.
Now in connection with that I want to speak a moment on what Christ has brought in. He has brought in what I may call the conditions of life, and I think we get them in figure in @Genesis 1, so that He might prepare the way to bring life into the world. It is very interesting to see that there are four conditions of life in @Genesis 1. For instance in verse 3, "God said, Let there be light. And there was light". Light is the first condition of life. I suppose there could be no question as to that. If light could be excluded from the earth for a very short time all animal life would come to an end, for light is the first condition of life; and that is the first thing in creation; and that is the first thing Christ brings in. There is no natural life apart from light, and no spiritual life apart from spiritual light, and Christ brings it in. He brings in the knowledge of God in grace, and that is the first thing I need as a poor dark sinner. What is the good of talking to me about man's intellect? I want the light of God; and where is it? I find it in Christ.
We read in @John 1: 4, "In him was life, and the life was the light of men". And in @John 8: 12 He says, "I am the light of the world". And now He is risen and glorified at God's right hand, the apostle Paul can say, "Because it is the God who spoke that out of darkness light should shine who has shone in our hearts for the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ" (@2 Corinthians 4: 6). Beloved friends, light has come in and has come into every Christian's heart here tonight. It is the first condition of life. There is no spiritual life if no light. How do you know God? You know him in Christ. Christ is the image of the invisible
{10}
God. You look at Christ and you see in Him the fulness of the Godhead dwelling in a Man; God revealed in a man and that man His beloved Son. Thank God for it. We are not in ignorance of God; He has made Himself known in His beloved Son. "No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared him" (@John 1: 18). That is light.
Now look at verse 6 of @Genesis 1: "And God said, Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it be a division between waters and waters". It is really the atmosphere. God thus created the atmosphere  --  first light and then the atmosphere. I suppose every child can see that if there was not an atmosphere there could be no life. We require an atmosphere to breathe. Now Christ has brought in a new atmosphere for us to live in, and if I may so describe it, I should say the atmosphere of a Christian's life is made up of peace and love. When Christ came into this world these two things, peace and love, came in His blessed Person. Divine peace and divine love came in for the first time. He brought the atmosphere of it. How wonderful that is! And He then introduced His disciples into that atmosphere of heaven. I have no doubt one thing the disciples knew while with Him was what it was to breathe the atmosphere of heaven. When the Lord asked them, "Will ye also go away?" Peter answers, "Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast words of life eternal" (@John 6: 67, 68). He knew then what it was to breathe the atmosphere of heaven around that blessed Person. But then to have it fully we must go on to resurrection; the ground of peace was not laid until Christ died; but then every disturbing element was removed, every foe defeated, and the blessed Victor comes into the midst of His disciples with that sacred brow decked with the laurels of triumph and says, "Peace be to you" (@John 20: 19). It was a new atmosphere, an atmosphere of peace.
What a wonderful thing, thus to be brought into peace! And by whom? By Christ. Who could bring a poor sinner like me into peace but Christ? And He has done it, blessed
{11}
be His Name! And divine life and love, never known in this world until Christ died (I mean in its fulness), has now come. Scripture says, "Herein as to us has been manifested the love of God, that God has sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him" (@1 John 4: 9). Love came out thus, and now the proper atmosphere for your soul and mine is the love of God. That is the atmosphere in which we can live. Christ has brought it to us. We have not to reach the love by some kind of effort. You may read religious books with this object. There is one entitled *The Imitation of Christ* written by a man who lived many years ago, where we may read a great deal about the love of God, and which puts people on the line of making effort to reach the love of God. I do not think this of any use; the love of God has been brought to us by Christ and made known to us by His death. And thus it becomes the atmosphere in which my soul can live.
We look now at verse 11: "And God said, Let the earth cause grass to spring up" ... . What we get on the third day is the grass, the herb, and the fruit trees, and these were intended to be food for man and beast. That is another condition of life. How long should we live if we had no food? And it is a wonderful thing to see how Christ has brought in divine food for us, spiritual food. And really everything that God has established in Christ is intended to be the food of our souls. Do you think we could feed our souls on the newspaper? I think some Christians get shrivelled up by reading so much of the literature of this world, and thus they lose their taste for divine food. I do not think anyone can enjoy the food of Egypt and the food of Canaan at the same time. If you relish the food of Egypt you will not relish the food of Canaan. In one word, Christ is the food of His people, and that is the food God gives to us, and He has sent His servants to feed His flock with it. Every bit of divine food is the ministry of Christ in some way or other. He sets before us that blessed Person for nourishment of our hearts in divine intelligence of Him. Is not that a condition of spiritual life? I am
{12}
sure it is, and if a person does not feed on divine food, he can know nothing about divine life.
One thing more as to the fourth day, verse 16, "And God made the two great lights, the great light to rule the day, and the small light to rule the night". That is, if life is to be sustained in nature, everything must be under proper control. Suppose things were not under proper control, suppose the law of gravitation ceased to act for five minutes, what would be the result? The whole universe would go to destruction. The created universe all depends on the law of gravitation, and according to that law, the sun rules the solar system, and everything is held in its place by the sun. The sun rules everything because all the influences that make this world habitable are under the rule of the sun. The seasons, seed time and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, are all under the rule of the sun.
Now there is something like that in the spiritual world. Christ is the Sun of the spiritual world. Nothing is right that is not regulated by Christ. It is a wonderful thing to see the place Christ has in it. God has put Christ at His right hand and He is there as the Head of all principalities and powers, angels and authorities and powers being made subject to Him; and Head over all things to the assembly, which is His body. He is the great Head and Centre of God's universe, and until our souls come into their proper relation to Christ, we are lawless, because we are not under rule, and if we are not under rule we do not enjoy life. It is one of the conditions of life; there should be rule. We are all thankful in this country for a measure of wise and righteous government. That is why the conditions are so much better than they are in some countries.
Now, what a blessed thing to be under the rule of Christ. You see, Christ has died that He might deliver us from the power of the law that we might be married to Him, and that we might come under His control. That, I suppose, is why the wife is to be subject to her husband; she is under rule in that way, not a legal rule, but a rule of love. In the same way
{13}
the assembly and the individual believer are under the rule of Christ; hence the first breath of spiritual life is expressed in the words "What shall I do, Lord?" (@Acts 22: 10). That is a man coming under the rule of Christ.
These then are the things that come out on the first four days of creation: first light, then atmosphere, then food, and then rule; and the next two days are taken up with the introduction of animal and human life. God first made the conditions and then He brought in life. Now Christ is the tree of life because He brings in the conditions of spiritual life. He brings in the light of God, a new atmosphere of love, the food, and then the rule. It is all brought in in Christ, and Christ is everything.
Now we will leave that part of the subject and say a little about the river. As I said at the first, the river seems to me to be symbolical of the Spirit of God. You see two things in Christianity: the first, Christ is the object, and God never gives us any other object but Christ in that sense; and the second, the Spirit is an indwelling Person; that is, as we sometimes say, we have the Spirit subjectively to dwell in us, and so in that way our souls, being watered by the river, shall be a fruitful garden for the Lord. That is why the Spirit is given, to be the river of God in our souls, making us fresh and bright and full of spiritual energy towards Christ and towards God.
Now it is a wonderful thing that when Christ came into this world He was introduced in the same way in all the four gospels. In each gospel He is introduced to us as the One who baptised with the Holy Spirit. Is not that very striking? It is quite true Christ did not actually give the Spirit until He was glorified, but everything that transpired in the life of Jesus Christ was in view of this great fact that He was going to give the Spirit to those that believe. But the gift of the Holy Spirit is a thing many Christians leave out of account altogether. They hardly think of it. They know perhaps there is something about it in Scripture but they know nothing about it in their souls. I put it to every Christian here, 'Do
{14}
you know anything about the gift of the Holy Spirit in your own experience?' I do not ask how many books you have read on the subject, or how much you know from the Scriptures, but do you know anything about the river of God in your soul? That is a plain home question. There is such a thing as the river of God in the soul of the believer.
As I have said, you find when Christ came into this world, He became the object of attraction. He was in this world an attractive object, a divine object, and souls were attracted to Him. We see two of John's disciples follow Him as thus attracted, and they say, "Rabbi ... where abidest thou?" (@John 1: 38). Then there was in the same chapter Simon, and then Nathanael, and in chapter 3 Nicodemus; these were all thus attracted; also the woman of Samaria in chapter 4. Beloved friends, God's object in attracting souls to Christ was and is that they might receive from Christ the Holy Spirit; that they might receive from Christ the well of living water flowing in their souls. That is the river of God of which this river in @Genesis 2 is the emblem.
Well, the first thing is to be attracted to Christ. I am speaking now to a company of believers and it is my sincere hope that every one in this company has been attracted to Christ. We have received a great many blessings as believers through Him. If we have forgiveness of sins it is through Christ; if justification, it is through Christ; if peace with God, it is through Christ. There is not a single blessing we have but we have it through Christ. But what is the effect that all this is intended to produce? It is intended to make Christ precious to our hearts. It has been God's great thought for us to make Christ precious to our hearts so that our hearts may be taken out of the world and from ourselves by the preciousness of Christ. And suppose we are attracted to Christ, what do we find? That He baptises with the Holy Spirit and gives living water. He sends the Comforter. He says, "He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water" (@John 7: 38). Now I want every Christian here to see this; the gift of the Spirit is not a small
{15}
thing, not a secondary thing, not a thing that comes in as it were by the way. It is the one great thing in Scripture, that we are drawn to Christ in order that we may receive from Christ the gift of the Holy Spirit.
Well, what is the effect of the gift of the Spirit? I must be very brief now, but I would like to leave upon every heart here the immense effect of the gift of the Spirit. We see in @John 4, when the Lord was with the woman at the well, He says to her, "Whosoever drinks of the water which I shall give him shall never thirst for ever" (verse 14). The first action of the Spirit of God in our souls is to keep us, if I may so say, green and fresh towards Christ, to keep us from being withered. There are several scriptures in the Old Testament in which God speaks of the souls of the saints as a well-watered garden. Now God has a garden, and your soul and mine is the garden of the Lord where the tender plants are growing. And as in Genesis the river of God waters the garden, so the Spirit waters us now. Not only is the tree of life the object of my faith and love; but there is the river, God's blessed Spirit, to water the garden now. How, let me ask, is your soul getting on? Are you dry and withered, or green and fresh, spiritually green and fresh? The psalmist could say, "I am like a green olive-tree in the house of God" (@Psalm 52: 8). It is a great thing to be green there. But there is no natural tendency in you or me to keep bright and fresh towards Christ.
How often we find a young convert comes to Christ and the blessed God makes Christ precious to him, and he goes away perhaps from a meeting with his heart happy and his face shining with joy. He has made acquaintance with Christ, and he goes out into the world, and what is the natural course of things? Very much like a sovereign among a lot of lead bullets. What happens? Do the bullets become shining like the sovereign? Oh, no, the sovereign soon gets to look as dull as the bullets. That is the effect of the influences here. The spiritual shine is taken out. Thus we often see a young convert get dull, so that we can hardly trace any difference between him and a worldling. Now the Spirit is given to
{16}
exclude the possibility of that by springing up as a well in our soul. The Spirit is thus the divine spring, the river of God to flow in the soul, to water the garden, to keep it green and fresh, a fruitful evergreen for God. Oh, what a wonderful thing it is to have the river of God in the soul! What a reality it is!
Perhaps you say, 'I know nothing about it'. Well, I want every soul to leave this meeting tonight realising that the gift of the Spirit, as the river of God in the soul of the believer, is a great reality. And I believe if your soul accepts that, you will go away with an exercised heart and never settle down until God has made it good to you. You find in @John 14 that the Lord speaks to His disciples for the first time of their love to Him. He had spoken before of His love to them, but here He says, "If ye love me, keep my commandments. And I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever" (verses 15, 16). The Comforter was given in connection with the fact that there were some in this world who loved the Son of God. These are the people who receive the Spirit, people who love the Son of God, and the Spirit comes in to maintain the heart of the believer in freshness of affection for the Son of God.
Is not that a wonderful thing, a blessed thing? It is a comfort to me that I am kept not by some effort of mine. If my heart is kept for Christ in the smallest measure, it is kept by the Spirit of God. The river of God is there flowing in the soul of the believer. I meant to have said more about this but I cannot enlarge, though I want you to see the great reality of it. In @John 15: 26 He says, "*He* shall bear witness concerning me". The Spirit is the spring of all testimony for Christ. If a man or a woman is in any way in testimony for Christ in this world, it is by the Spirit. And remember, the testimony of Christ in this world is a wonderful thing. I do not mean merely people preaching Christ  --  thank God for such  --  but if they do so really it is by the Spirit. But there is a far more effective testimony than that, and that is Christ living in this world, living in the hearts of His saints. Is not that a reality?
{17}
If Christ can be seen thus living in His saints in this world, with all those beautiful, heavenly, spiritual characteristics and graces that came out in Christ in perfection now coming out by the Spirit in His saints, is not that a reality? What brings out all this beautiful fruit? It is the river of God flowing through the garden of the soul to make it fruitful and to bring forth the fruit of the Spirit  --  love, joy, peace and so on  --  that the moral traits of Christ may be reproduced in the believer through the effect of the river of God in the soul.
Then in @John 16: 14 He says, "He shall glorify me, for he shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you". God has a wonderful world before Him, not this present world of Satan's power. He has another world, different altogether from this, in which Christ will come out as the Centre and Sun. It is God's coming world of blessing and glory, and the Spirit is going to be the all-pervading power of that world. That is what we get in @Revelation 22, the tree of life in the midst of the street of the city of God, and of the river which flows out from the throne of God and of the Lamb.
There is a time coming when Christ will be the tree of life for the universe of God. Heaven will find its life in that blessed Person, and earth will find its life in that blessed Person. And God will gather together in one all things which are in heaven and earth in Him. God will bring heaven and earth to feed upon eternal life. And not only that, but the river of God will be the vitalising power, the refreshing power of heaven and earth. As the hymn says,
<blockquote>'By the Spirit all pervading, <br>Hosts unnumbered round the Lamb'. (`14:5)</blockquote>
The river will flow out refreshing the universe.
What blessed things there are to come, and Christians are in the secret of them now, by being brought into the knowledge of Christ, and brought into the current of the Spirit, so that they are in the knowledge of God's mind in this the day of Christ's rejection. How wonderful it is to see on the first page of Scripture that God gives us a thought of everything
{18}
which is to come to pass in time and eternity in the tree and the river, Christ and the Spirit, showing He had everything ready for His own pleasure. And if God has effected anything in my soul it must be by Christ and the Spirit: Christ objectively, and the Spirit subjectively forming me in correspondence with the One I look at objectively. May God give us all to see the meaning of the tree and the river.
CHRIST THE CROWN OF ALL GOD'S WAYS
@Proverbs 8: 22 - 31; @Genesis 3: 15; @Genesis 12: 2; @2 Samuel 23: 1 - 5; @Psalm 133: 3
It is much to be desired that all Christians should be observant and thoughtful readers of Scripture, and this with a view to obtaining in a fuller way the knowledge of God. It is evident that man cannot by searching find out God. God is too great for man the creature to reach up to Him; and, in addition to this, sin has come in and put an immense *moral* distance between God and man. If God remained quiescent it is certain that man must be for ever in ignorance of Him. But God has been pleased in infinite goodness to take certain ways of which we have the record in Scripture, and of which Christ is the crown, so that we might have the intelligent knowledge of Himself. Indeed, it might be said that the whole of Scripture is the unfolding of two things --  the ways of God and His purposes. His purposes were in His mind before His ways began, and they will presently be displayed as the issue and result of His ways in scenes of accomplished bliss. The purposes of God show us the nature of His thoughts and delights  --  they instruct us in all that God has before Him for the satisfaction of His love. But into this vast and blessed subject I do not now enter. His ways are the theme of my
{19}
present meditation, and in speaking of His ways I do not use the term with reference to His government of men on earth, but in the wide sense of the course which He has taken to make Himself known, and to bring about the accomplishment of His purposes. The more we consider this great subject the more we shall discover in it the unfolding of what God is in wisdom, power, grace, and love  --  and all this while acting for the supreme good of man  --  and we shall plainly discern that Christ is the Crown of all the ways of God, and this will make Him very great and glorious in the estimation of our hearts.
The first great movement of God which is presented to us in Scripture is creation.
This must necessarily be so, or there would be no creatures to observe His further ways, or to be brought into infinite good as the result of those ways. The heavens and the earth were created, and the latter prepared and furnished in every way to be the habitation of man made in the image and after the likeness of God. But we miss the whole mind of God if we regard creation as anything other than the formation of a vast scene into which *Christ* should, in due time, be introduced  --  a scene which should eventually find its fulness and crown in Him. Hence we read that "By him were created all things, the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones, or lordships, or principalities, or authorities: all things have been created by him, and for him. And *he* is before all, and all things subsist together by him" (@Colossians l: 16, 17). Christ is the beginning and end of all the ways of God (@Proverbs 8: 22 - 31. Read the whole passage). It was in view of *Christ* that everything was created, and creation will never be seen or understood in its proper beauty and completeness until it is seen in relation to Christ  --  finding its Head and glory in Him in the day of completed reconciliation.
If I look around in creation now, I see the bondage of corruption on every side, the result of man's sin. (Unless, indeed, I survey the heavens, and see the glory of God there
{20}
in perfection of beauty and order  --  a striking contrast to all the discord and confusion found on earth.) But it was all made for Christ, and it will be seen in its true character and beauty when He becomes manifestly its Head.
When we come to the creation of man we see a very distinct foreshadowing of Christ. It is expressly said that Adam was "the figure of him to come" (@Romans 5: 14). Who but Christ could really fill up all that was involved in being in the image and after the likeness of God? Who but Christ could have all things put under Him to order everything for the good pleasure of God? I do not enlarge on a truth so obvious.
The second thing which strikes me in connection with the unfolding of God's ways in Scripture is promise.
This element was introduced as soon as man had departed from his first estate. There was no occasion for promises so long as innocence continued. Man was surrounded by every good possible to him in the circumstances of his existence as an innocent creature, and promises of a higher order of blessing neither would have been appropriate nor could have been understood by one who as yet had not the knowledge of good and evil. But when the accomplished act of disobedience had proved the success of the serpent in alienating man from God, and man had thus fallen under the power of evil and the sentence of death, immediately the element of promise appears in God's ways. It may be said that the statement that the woman's Seed should bruise the serpent's head was not exactly a promise to man, but rather part of the divine sentence on the serpent. But inasmuch as it was a declaration of what God would bring to pass with a view to His own glory in man's blessing, it certainly was of the nature of promise. And, henceforward, promises form by far the most important and blessed part of the Old Testament Scriptures.
It is impossible to go into detail on such a great subject without extending the present remarks far beyond their intended limits. But it may be said in general that the Old
{21}
Testament promises fall into three classes: those which stand in relation to sin and death and Satan's power in the widest and fullest way; those which stand in relation to all the confusion which sin has introduced here; and those which come in in connection with the utter weakness of man. I will give an example of each class.
In @Genesis 3 we see the introduction of sin and death and Satan's power. These three things go together. No sooner were they introduced than God appeared on the scene with a blessed declaration of His own purpose (@Genesis 3: 15). It is so all through Scripture. As different manifestations of the power of evil and its fruits appeared, God met them with promises. In the case before us, the serpent had no sooner shown his head than God said, 'I will have a Man to bruise that head'. And as the history of evil and of man's weakness developed, God met it all by promises. He pledged Himself to remove the evil, and to put a corresponding good in its place. So every manifestation of what was evil became the occasion for a promise in which God engaged Himself to remove that evil, and to put in its place what was good, and holy, and blessed.
It is a terribly solemn fact that sin, and death, and Satan's power have come into the world. Men struggle in vain to get rid of these things. All civilised nations are doing their best to improve the condition of things here. They succeed, perhaps, in whitewashing the exterior a little, but under the surface there are "dead men's bones, and all uncleanness" (@Matthew 23: 27). These men try to grapple with death. People are deeply interested in medical science and hail with delight every new discovery. They are glad to think that death can be pushed back a year or two. But how impotent is man in all this! Sin is here and men cannot remove it; death is here and men cannot set it aside; Satan's power is here and men are glad to have it so. An overwhelming majority are in favour of Satan's rule, and prefer it to God's. Satan says to man, 'You can go your own way', but if God were to rule He would
{22}
necessarily say, 'You must go My way'. Men say, 'We prefer to go our own way, and not God's way'. They thus choose to be ruled by Satan.
How blessed to see that God has brought in Christ to meet the question of sin, and to annul death and Satan's power! Christ has put away sin, annulled death, and bruised the serpent's head. In contrast to sin and death and Satan's power, He has brought in righteousness and life and the kingdom of God. He is the Antitype of the coats of skin and the tree of life. The promise of @Genesis 3: 15 finds its Yea and Amen in Him.
Then in @Genesis 12: 2 we have an example of a class of promises which have relation to all the confusion which sin has introduced here. Sin and death and Satan's power having come in, there is confusion here instead of blessing. Everything is out of order. "Let us make ourselves a name" (@Genesis 11: 4) is man's supreme ideal of happiness. Many a man would be willing to sacrifice wealth, rest, pleasure, health, natural affection, and even life itself if he could thereby make himself a name. But all this results in Babel (confusion), because it excludes God, and there is no true happiness in it. "Blessing" is happiness conferred by God. God's answer to Babel was the calling out and blessing of Abram. "I will ... bless thee, and make thy name great" (@Genesis 12: 2). God called him out of the confusion of the world to have true happiness, and to be made great in a divine way. The world has but a poor idea of happiness and greatness; it is all confusion if looked at morally. But God delights to make men happy and great by giving them the knowledge of Christ. God made Abram's name great by bringing Christ into his family. All blessing from God is centred in Christ. Men are looking for happiness either in the Babel of sin's confusion or in Christ. The world system often looks very attractive to the young; they do not see the emptiness of it all; but it is all tinsel and unreality. There is very little real happiness in the hearts of worldly people, with all their pleasures. They get a certain amount of gratification for their natural tastes but
{23}
very little real enjoyment. Viewed morally all is in confusion here because God has not His true place in men's consciences and hearts, and there can be no real happiness in confusion.
Christ was here entirely apart from all the confusion of this world. He loved righteousness and hated lawlessness, and therefore was anointed with the oil of gladness above His companions. If men are led by Christ it will certainly be in the paths of righteousness, and only in those paths can true happiness be found or enjoyed. Christ is Lord of all and Head of every man, and in confessing and obeying Him we get outside the confusion of the world, and into the sphere of true blessing. In a coming day He will have universal sway, and all confusion will be at an end. He will order everything in righteousness, lawlessness will cease, and therefore every hindrance to the full blessing of man will be removed. Inconceivable happiness will pervade the universe when everything is subjugated by the gracious power of Christ to the will of God. Every kind of misery and suffering will be set aside, and the supreme goodness of God will be the satisfaction and happiness of men. Then shall be brought to pass what is written in @Genesis 12: 3, "In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed". Every element of confusion and evil will be displaced by order and goodness, and everything will minister to the unalloyed happiness of men.
With regard to the present time, Christ is presented to men in the gospel that they may be attracted to Him, and thus morally separated from this world of confusion. It is certain that God has more resource and power to confer happiness than the world or its prince, and in believing on Christ and obeying Him we come into blessing  --  God-given happiness.
God gives what is worthy of Himself, and therefore the happiness of those who receive from Him is immeasurable. The promises express God's unnumbered thoughts of blessing towards man. They are all brought to pass in Christ, and established through redemption in such a way that they can never be overturned.
{24}
Then a third class of promises comes in by reason of the utter weakness of man. For an example of this class I turn to @2 Samuel 23: 1 - 5. These were the last words of David. God's gentleness had made David very great; many divine promises were connected with him; but he came to his last words -- he was not suffered to continue by reason of death. Death is the utter weakness of man. The promises could not be established in a man who was going down into death. David was not strong enough to hold the promises. He had to recognise the necessity for another Person to come in who should be "as the light of the morning, like the rising of the sun, a morning without clouds". There was One who could pass through the night of man's death and condemnation, and rise to be the Sun of an eternal day -- One able to hold everything for the glory of God and the blessing of man in the power of resurrection. David had to turn from himself and his own house to Christ. He was dying, and his house was "not so before God", but he could turn to a greater Person in whom everything should be established in the light and power of resurrection. "An everlasting covenant, ordered in every way and sure" is established in a risen Christ. Man in the flesh could not hold the promises of God by reason of death, but David, by the Spirit, was in view of One who could establish them and hold them for ever. Whatever promises of God there are, in Christ is the Yea, and in Him the Amen.
In the world to come, death will no longer be a dark cloud resting upon everything here. The blessing will be commanded, even life for evermore (@Psalm 133: 3). The righteous will enter into life eternal. Men will enjoy without a cloud the favour of God; death will be swallowed up in victory. All this has been made known in the way of promise, and there is not a single promise of which Christ is not the crown. It is He, and He alone, in whom and by whom all will be fulfilled.
{25}
GOOD AND EVIL
@Genesis 3: 22; @Hebrews 5: 13, 14
C.A.C. I was thinking what an immense thing it is to have the knowledge of good and evil. Man acquired that knowledge through the fall: it did not please God to create man holy; He might have done if it had so pleased Him. God had created angels as holy beings, and many of them He has preserved and does preserve in His sovereignty from falling into evil. It did not please God to create man as a holy being but as an innocent being; and as such he did not know good and evil, and he only obtained that knowledge by falling under the power of evil.
Ques. Would you explain the difference between an innocent being and a holy being?
C.A.C. An innocent being has no knowledge of evil, but a holy being has; he has a nature which is like the nature of God, which abhors evil. God knows good and evil, and He says, "Man is become as one of us". God as knowing good and evil in His holy nature has an abhorrence of evil. Man by the fall has acquired the knowledge of good and evil, but he has acquired that knowledge by falling under the power of evil.
Ques. Does an innocent being know good?
C.A.C. Yes, Adam and Eve in innocence knew nothing but good; they were in a scene where every sight and sound spoke of divine beneficence, a scene of absolute good. There was no temptation to evil in that created scene, nor was there any tendency to evil in the man as created of God: it says he was "very good". The most wonderful part of the creation was the man who was at the head of it. He was put there in responsibility to God, and there was one definite mark of that responsibility: the tree of knowledge of good and evil was there, and man was forbidden to eat of it. There was a moral reason for his being forbidden; it was not an arbitrary
{26}
restriction, but because an innocent being was not equal to the question of good and evil. It was a question in the mind of God that could only be solved by Christ, a holy Being, and One equal to the tremendous issues that hung upon this question of good and evil. Evil had come into the universe the moment Satan said "I will", and it became the great question in the universe. Now the great question in the world is this question of good and evil. Men try to shut their eyes to it, and to make one believe there are all sorts of other questions, but this is the great question. It is being worked out in the world and in the individual souls of men, and in the souls of the saints: it is being worked out in every one of us. This question of good and evil is the most practical question that can possibly be raised. It is what makes man to differ from the animal; he has direct responsibility Godward, and he has the knowledge of good and evil. The conscience is that faculty which applies the knowledge of good and evil to man's responsible course: every man has to face this question, and we have to. We are being faced every day and every hour by this question, and there is no getting away from it. It all comes back to this, How far do we know God, and how far are we brought into harmony with God in order to approve the good and to refuse the evil, and to get the two things disentangled?
When God brought in the law, it was in a certain sense a disentanglement of things. To some extent it defined good and evil; and the knowledge of good and evil which man has acquired through the fall is in harmony with that discrimination of good and evil which the law makes. We find in heathen moralists and philosophers a great many things like the law: Scripture says, they "Practise by nature the things of the law ... who show the work of the law written in their hearts" (@Romans 2: 14, 15). That is part of the condition that man came into as having the knowledge of good and evil. Everybody has to battle with this question; even the heathen, since they have "the work of the law written in their hearts", must battle with this question. If a man has not fallen below
{27}
the level proper to man he shows the working of the law written in his heart. Some people have fallen below what is proper to man altogether; they have no laws or literature, and by a remarkable action of God's judgment, they have come to a state below the level of man altogether. It is a very solemn condition of things for man, as created, to get into a savage state, and among such people you will find that the knowledge of good and evil is very feeble. Dr. Glenny said of the Kaffirs that you can get them converted, baptised and into fellowship, but you cannot stop them stealing and telling lies. There is a very feeble sense with them of good and evil; they have fallen below the level proper to man even as a fallen being. Conscience applies the knowledge of good and evil to responsibility: it is that faculty by which a man is able to take account of things, and to approve or disapprove of things morally, either in one's own conduct or in the conduct of others. Conscience is not the same thing as the knowledge of good and evil because you could not speak of God having a conscience, but, of course, God has the knowledge of good and evil. Man has come into a condition and sphere where he has to take account of this question of good and evil; the question was existent before man came into it, but now he has come into it he cannot get out of it. There is no relief and no solution to the question till we come to Christ: all God's ways with men are to bring them to the recognition of that.
God's early ways with men are set forth in the book of Job, where there is an elaborate discussion of the question of good and evil; it serves to show how much in the dark even pious men were. These men in Job all feared God; there was not an infidel among them; they recognised God's ways with all men through observing their own exercises and those of other people. They have an elaborate discussion on this question of good and evil, and the whole point they have to come to is that God only can deal with it. When we are brought to that, we are brought to the true acknowledgement that we ought never to have touched it; we are brought back to judge the first principle of the fall -- that we ought never to
{28}
have touched this question. It is a fine moment in the history of the soul when we get right back to judge this first act of disobedience, and see that no one can handle this question but God: we are cast on God now. Job was brought to that in the end. What was dwelt on by Elihu was the greatness of God, His competence to do anything in every part of creation. Elihu talks about the things of the earth, the animals, the trees and everything. What is he driving at? To show you that God is equal to everything. As to all those things which man cannot do at all, God says, 'I will manage it without you!' This leads to a moral issue; it brings Job to the point that this question of good and evil is so tremendous that only God can take it up and settle it, and then Job says, "I abhor myself". He says, 'I am hopelessly involved and cannot get out', but he says to God, 'Thou canst get me out'. When a man comes to that he has got somewhere. The Creator must be the Redeemer and the Justifier, and that means the solving of the whole problem of good and evil.
When the Lord Jesus appeared on earth this question began to assume a tangible form; that is, there was for the first time in this world a perfect presentation of good. A new and divine expression of good had come in, such as was never known before. This was something quite different from the law, which was more abstract. When you see the Person of Christ here -- the Son of God in manhood -- you have good in a Person in tangible form. In Him you have the setting forth of all that God was in His infinite goodness in the face of every kind of disorder and distraction which had come into the world through sin. It is very beautiful to sit down and contemplate the perfection of good embodied in a lonely Man moving through this world. When we come to the consideration of Christ we are not troubled with the question of good and evil; the heart has reached the solution of it, because in considering Christ we have not to disentangle the good from the evil. If we look at any other man, the best saint that ever lived, Abraham, David, or anybody else, we find we have to disentangle good from evil, and we are not
{29}
always sure we have done it properly. When we come to Christ it is blessed, divine purity, unmixed good, untainted by any evil. The way we learn evil is by seeing how it stands in contrast to that. That is the great education God is giving us: he is educating us in the presence of infinite good in Christ, so that we should become like God in the knowledge of good and evil and be able to estimate it as God does, and not as a fallen sinner who struggles with it as a hopeless problem. The one who knows God is brought to look at it with the same kind of vision that God does. One is thankful that it is so.
Christ always links Himself directly with God. He would not allow Himself to be acknowledged as good except in relation to God, saying, "There is none good but one, God" (@Luke 18: 19). He insists upon it that God is good and the source of good, so that there would not be good even in Him if He were not the expression of God in this world. He was "God manifest in flesh" and "over all, God blessed for ever", yet He says, "Why callest thou me good? There is none good but one, God". He was seeking to lead the young man to the recognition that all that is good is in God; the evil all comes from Satan. It is very simple to say but an immense thing to learn in our souls that all that is good is of God. There is nothing but good in Him, and all that is evil is of Satan. We have got the question disentangled *then*. The young man was building on a lot of good in himself, and putting himself alongside of Christ, as much as to say, 'Tell me what to do and I will do it, I am as good as Thou art'. He was assuming to be on a level with Christ. If he had come as a poor sinner it would have been quite different, but he comes on a level with Christ. He had not begun to disentangle things.
The cross comes in, and you get what you could not get before -- the word of righteousness. You could not get the testimony of righteousness before the cross. We see in the cross and the death of Christ how the sinful man has been completely condemned and removed, the man who had
{30}
become the embodiment of evil. Evil had never been embodied before because Satan is a spirit. Evil became embodied in man and that man in whom it became embodied has come under judgment in the death of Christ. Christ was made sin, made sacrificially evil in that sense, so that evil might be judged according to the holiness of God in the death of Christ. We ought all of us to be "skilled in the word of righteousness". Many are not, and they are not because they have not got their senses exercised to distinguish between good and evil. Things are in hopeless confusion with them and they do not know how to distinguish between the first man and the second.
Ques. How do we become skilled?
C.A.C. It is the result of moral formation, and by being brought to appreciate what is involved in the word of righteousness. The word of righteousness makes known to me that all that I am as a man in the flesh has been judged in the death of Christ; all has been righteously judged there and removed so that I might be with God on another footing altogether, on the footing of Christ and His death. It has all become a testimony now; God is testifying it by the word of righteousness. It is a great thing to be skilled in it. Many of the Jewish believers were not skilled in the word of righteousness so they were only babes, requiring to be fed with milk; they were not marked by spiritual manhood; they had not learned to distinguish good and evil. A great many professing Christians, and even true believers, are in that condition. They have not grown up and are not spiritually formed so as to be habituated to distinguish good and evil. Our spiritual prosperity very largely depends on our ability to distinguish good and evil.
Ques. What does "the word of righteousness" convey to *us*?
C.A.C. I think it is the testimony of the way in which righteousness has been established by the complete setting aside of man in the flesh and the establishing of all that is of God in Christ. I take it that is the word of righteousness, and
{31}
we are to be skilled in it. "Being complete as regards the fruit of righteousness, which is by Jesus Christ" (@Philippians 1: 11), is connected with this subject, because Paul says that he is looking for them to be judges of and approving things that are more excellent. The Christian learns to judge of and approve the things that are excellent, and in result he becomes pure and without offence for Christ's day: he becomes purified from evil and approves what is good; he identifies himself with the good. The question is settled as far as he is concerned; it is disentangled. In Christ's day it will all be straightened out; God will have put down all rule and authority and power, every influence of Satan, demons or evil men, all will be put down and there will be the supremacy of good. That kind of thing is anticipated beforehand in the life of the believer; his senses are exercised -- habituated -- to the distinguishing of good and evil: that is what makes grown-up believers; they are being morally formed in the appreciation of what is good and in the divine nature. They appreciate what God appreciates, and repudiate what God repudiates. The believer is brought to know good and evil in a holy nature just as God does: this comes into the smallest details of life. Things are either good or evil; it touches every detail. As we grow up nourished by the sincere milk of the word, we are able to take "meat" and appreciate the new order of man come in Christ. It is not simply God's grace and mercy to sinful man -- that is like milk; but the meat is that God has brought in in Christ a new order of man altogether for His pleasure. As we begin to feed on that we get wonderful ability for distinguishing good and evil. Things may be very nice in the eyes of men and yet very evil: what is not of Christ is evil. All that is of God has come into manhood in Christ and become to us excellent. As we judge and approve of it and follow that kind of life, we become sincere and without offence for Christ's day: the question of good and evil is worked out. By and by we shall be removed from the presence of evil; when we go to heaven we shall leave the place where evil is present. We shall still know evil throughout
{32}
eternity, and know it in a holy nature as God knows it. We shall know evil as having been judged in the sin-offering death of the righteous One and having been absolutely removed from God's reconciled universe: we shall be brought into perfect accord with God as to it all. This question of good and evil is the great question of Scripture. There are two great subjects in the Scripture. That which is most dwelt on and which Scripture is greatly occupied with is the question of good and evil; but there is another question which lies behind it, and that is the eternal purpose of God for the satisfaction of His love. Before ever evil came in, God's purpose was to have sons before Him for the pleasure of His own love, formed for that purpose in Christ. There is no question of good and evil there, nothing to consider but the thoughts of His own love. The secret of eternal purpose only came to light after Christ died and had gone to the right hand of God: there was nothing remaining then to interfere with God having His own pleasure in the blessing of many sons set before Him in the acceptance of the Beloved. It is wonderful the way God takes to bring man into correspondence with Himself. "That we should be holy and blameless before him in love" -- that has to do with the question of good and evil; our being holy and without blame stands in that connection. But when it says, "Having marked us out beforehand for adoption through Jesus Christ to himself", that is purpose. It goes back to before ever the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was planted in Eden.
All our moral exercises run on the line of distinguishing good and evil, whether individually or in the assembly; all our exercises run on that line. The exercises of affection go on the other line, on the line of the place God has given us before Him according to His eternal purpose.
{33}
THE DEATH OF CHRIST
@Genesis 6: 13, 14; @Genesis 8: 20; @Genesis 15: 7 - 21
We were seeing last week that the death of Christ is prefigured in the deep sleep that fell on Adam with a view to his having a companion, the assembly in type. Then we see the death of Christ again in the coats of skin with which God clothed man when he had come into the nakedness of sin; and then in the offering of Abel we see the death of Christ is what the saint can bring to God. God brings the death of Christ to man in coats of skin, but Abel in his offering brings the death of Christ to God.
The ark is another aspect of the death of Christ; it is His death as the end of all flesh before God. If God is to have any relations at all with man they must be under cover of the death of Christ. If all flesh is corrupt, God could not take up relations with it, it must go out of sight, and as a matter of fact it did go out of sight; it was all under the waters of judgment or in the ark. This type shows the footing on which God can have to say to men on earth. It has nothing to do with heaven; we do not need an ark to go to heaven. I say this to show the setting of this scripture. Nothing was said to Enoch about making an ark; Enoch did not need one for he was a heavenly man, a type of the assembly. He was going to heaven and God took him there without dying; he went on the ground of the death of Christ. Enoch had been clothed with the coats of skin, and had known what it was to approach God as Abel did, but in this type we see that if God is to be in relation with man it must be on this ground that they come under cover of the death of Christ. Peter tells us that if a man has a good conscience he will want to be under cover. Peter says in referring to the ark, "Which figure also now saves you, even baptism ... the demand as before God of a good conscience" (@1 Peter 3: 21). That is to say, a man with a good conscience, an exercised conscience, would ask
{34}
for baptism, would want to be on different ground from corrupt flesh, and that is under cover of the death of Christ.
All men are under God's eye on the ground of the death of Christ, but faith takes it up intelligently. It is just because God sees man on the ground of the death of Christ that He sends His gospel out to all men. It is not a question of corrupt flesh; God is not going on now in relation with corrupt flesh, but He has in the death of Christ such a vindication of His glory in respect of corrupt flesh, that He can go on in mercy and grace with man, and faith takes this up intelligently.
How blessed for a saint to put himself and his household under cover of the death of Christ; it is only in that way we can give the Lord His place. Peter says a good conscience would ask to be under cover of the death of Christ, but we should not ask for that if we did not know He was out of death; it is "By the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who is at the right hand of God, gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers being subjected to him" (@1 Peter 3: 21, 22). He is in supremacy as Lord, and we take up all the responsibilities of life on that footing. Saints and households have come under cover of the death of Christ, and now they own Christ as Lord, and take up everything, business and family relationships, in *the Lord*. God can go on with people and people can go on intelligently with God, on that footing. We have been baptised to the death of Christ, and in the Name of the Lord.
We have to take two types together: the ark, and then the altar in chapter 8, verse 20. When Noah comes out of the ark he builds an altar; it is the first altar in Scripture, and in building it Noah claims the earth for God, as much as to say, 'The earth is not for corrupt flesh any longer, but for God': he puts everything on the ground of the burnt-offering. The death of Christ is not only a covering for corrupt flesh, covering it in a holy way under the eye of God, but it becomes a positive sweet savour before God, and everything is now according to that; all His providence, all His relations with earth, are on the ground of the death of Christ. This gives
{35}
one a very wide idea of the death of Christ; every bit of food a man puts in his mouth, he is indebted to the death of Christ for. "Henceforth, all the days of the earth, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease" (@Genesis 8: 22). God has established it all by covenant on the ground of the death of Christ; this gives one a wonderful thought of the scope and preciousness of that death. What a blessed thing to be in the secret of all God's providential dealings! They are all based on the sweet savour which He has found in the death of Christ, but for those who do not avail themselves of God's grace, judgment is inevitable.
After the sweet "savour of rest" we find in chapter 9 God blessing. He had not blessed before except when He blessed Adam and Eve in innocence, but then in chapter 3 the curse comes in, and there is no blessing again till God smelt a "savour of rest", and "God blessed". He could bless because the death of Christ had set His heart free. It is natural for God to bless; He is the blessed God, it is contrary to His nature to curse. The "savour of rest" is that God rests when His glory is established; the full result will be in the world to come. Noah claims the earth for God, and places the earth and man on the footing of the burnt-offering; it will all be placed there in the world to come; all the earth then will be under God's eye in the savour of the burnt-offering, and God will rest because He has been perfectly glorified. God is more glorified through the death of Christ than He would have been in an eternity of innocence. Now everything is according to the satisfaction that God has found in the death of Christ; whether it is the blessing of man, or the covenant with the earth and with every living creature, all speaks of God's satisfaction in the sweet savour. He is restful in blessing and restful in providence. What a thought it gives one of Christ and of His death! We are considering the death of Christ this evening, not as a mere abstraction, but so that we might be furnished, and have our souls fitted to be near to God. While the death of Christ is the ground on which God
{36}
can go on with men, yet men do not go on with God apart from an intelligent action of faith. We are told that both Enoch and Noah walked with God, Enoch in communion with God about His heavenly thoughts, and Noah in communion about His earthly thoughts. *We* want to walk with God in both ways; God loves to have His saints in communion with Him about His thoughts.
It is an immense thing for us to have God's view of the burnt-offering. In a sense it is only provisional, for violence and corruption still fill the earth, but faith moves on in this wonderful secret, knowing God's attitude through the death of Christ. God in mercy put government in the hand of Noah, which has to a great extent restrained corruption and violence, but when God has allowed the restraints of government to be removed for a time, we can then see what man is. These principles are world-wide and take in the whole human family; it was all in the ark, there was not a man that was not represented. Noah is the ancestor of every one of us.
If we pass on to chapter 15 we get another striking type of the death of Christ, and there it is in relation to the inheritance. God pledges Himself to give the inheritance through this figure of the death of Christ -- "a heifer of three years old, and a she goat ... and a ram", etc. (@Genesis 15: 9). This is a further thought, not brought out before, that it was in the heart of God to give man a portion. God called Abraham out with this in view, and said, 'I will show you a land and I will give it to you'. This brings us to what is in the heart of God for man. The thought of inheritance is a very great thought in Scripture and with God. He calls a man out to give him a special portion, thought of by His love. It is not what man needed or desired, but what God desired and proposed to gratify His own love. Here it is the earthly inheritance, Canaan, the place of the nation Israel, but undoubtedly it is a figure of the heavenly inheritance; for us it is heavenly. Think of God giving a portion to man so that man may know His love. Sometimes a man comes into an inheritance in an arbitrary way, perhaps his father has not much power over it,
{37}
but this inheritance is the outcome of the beneficence of God's love. If we want to know His love we must know something of the inheritance. The assembly will share all with Christ, but our special inheritance is heavenly, it is every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies, and it is connected with the knowledge of God Himself. It is spiritual territory; it is God bringing us near to Himself in order that we might know the expanse of His thoughts. It suggests to me "the breadth and length and depth and height" (@Ephesians 3: 18). The death of Christ in @Genesis 15 is the way God pledges Himself to give the inheritance. He binds Himself by covenant, He passes through death, He engages Himself in the most solemn way. It is in answer to Abram's question, "How shall I know that I shall possess it?" It is striking to see how God passed through, as a smoking furnace, a burning lamp or flame of fire -- that is the character in which He engages Himself. What it conveys to me is this: if God is going to give an inheritance He will give it in a holy way through the death of Christ. Then there is another side: it can only be possessed in a holy way; so God, as the furnace and flame of fire, presents Himself as One who will refine and purify the heirs, in order that they may be suited to the inheritance. If He is going to give us an inheritance through the death of Christ, we can only *possess* it through death. All the holiness manifested in the death of Christ must mark the heirs. God passes through in a flame of fire, He says, 'I am going to refine My people to make them suitable to the inheritance'. This is why God's people are an afflicted and disciplined people; He passes them through affliction in order to inherit by a holy way, and there is no other way by which God can bring the heirs into the inheritance. We all have to face it. Look at the exercise it was to Abraham; a horror of great darkness fell upon him. He got a sense by the Spirit prophetically of all the people would have to go through to fit them for the inheritance. They had four hundred years of affliction and bondage: that was not much like receiving an inheritance! God is a furnace; He has manifested holiness in the death of Christ; He is
{38}
refining His people and is going to eliminate everything from them that is inconsistent with that death. "Our God is a consuming fire" (@Hebrews 12: 29). This type corresponds with @Hebrews 12; we get teaching there about chastening. And in @Isaiah 48: 10, God says, "I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction". We do not understand God's ways and we wonder at them -- think of four hundred years of affliction! You see, the time is not yet come for wrongs to be righted, for judgment to be executed -- "the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full" (@Genesis 15: 16). Most of our sufferings are caused by wrongs that the world is full of, and that is enduring affliction. Suppose your body is ill, that is the fruit of sin; it is part of a condition of things, the result of the incoming of evil; it belongs to a system where all is wrong. God says, 'I want you purified for the inheritance'. If we see what He is at, we shall have great confidence; there is no escape; there is not a person here that does not know something of affliction. If he does not, he is not a son but a bastard! "If ye are without chastening, ... then ye are bastards, and not sons" (@Hebrews 12: 8). God is the purifying furnace for His people. You may say, 'The Egyptians trouble me'. No, it is the refining furnace. It does not say the people are types, but the things that happened to them are types, they "have been written for our admonition" (@1 Corinthians 10: 11). The people were in the furnace of affliction four hundred years; this is the type. We are all in the furnace; it is not always heated to the same degree because God is compassionate and He eases it off when He sees we cannot bear it any longer. God's idea of holiness is the death of Christ, and you must go that way too; God says, 'I am going to burn up all the flesh and nature; if I did not you could not enjoy the inheritance'. If you see that, you take every affliction as a mark of divine love -- "I rebuke and discipline as many as I love" (@Revelation 3: 19). We have to face this that is so dreadful to nature. Abraham gives us what it is to nature, a horror of great darkness. It is terrible to nature to be afflicted and disciplined, but if you look at it in faith it is God's way of reaching His
{39}
own end and it is according to the death of Christ. Would you like anything to be left about you that is inconsistent with the death of your Saviour? Every saint would say, 'I want to be like my precious Saviour'. God is going to refine us; He has us in a furnace and it is pretty hot, but He will justify Himself in all His ways, and when He has done with us we shall come forth as gold.
There is another point we should notice: the fowls came (verse 11). What a lot there are about! They are birds of prey -- the devil is always trying to take away the death of Christ from the saints; he is so subtle he always tries to take it away from our hearts and minds. Abraham drove the birds away, so faith drives the devil away.
There is one more type of the death of Christ in @Genesis 22; we are all familiar with it. The great point there is the Father and the Son going together; it is that aspect of the death of Christ, and it is developed in varied details in John's gospel. The Father and the Son move together with one thought and one purpose and one motive; everything that is in the heart of the Father is in the heart of the Son, and They move on together to that which is the basis and foundation on which They will carry out Their thoughts. The Son is in communion with every thought of the Father. What an added thought of sweetness that the One who died moved on to the place of sacrifice in perfect communion with the heart of God. He said, "I am not alone, for the Father is with me" (@John 16: 32). And He is with the Father. All God's universe of blessing is the fruit of the death of Christ in that wondrous aspect.
{40}
THREE NECESSITIES
@Genesis 21: 14 - 19; @Genesis 22: 1 - 14; @Genesis 24: 1 - 4, 66, 67
We find in these three chapters pictures of three great necessities, and the way in which they are met. The water of life is necessary for *man*, the burnt-offering is necessary for the glory of *God*, and the bride is necessary for the satisfaction of the heart of *Christ*.
Ishmael was connected by the closest *natural* tie with one who is called the friend of God. He was born and brought up in the place of greatest privilege on earth. He thus represents a natural man favoured with divine privileges. There are those here tonight who have been born into christian households, brought up under christian instruction and surrounded by christian influences. You have had privileges greater than Ishmael's, but they have not perhaps affected your heart or subdued your will.
Ishmael had to do with a person who was a remarkable type of Christ. Indeed it was not until Isaac came upon the scene that Ishmael appeared in his true colours. When the child of promise -- a type of Christ -- was honoured in Abraham's house, Ishmael's heart had no share in the joy. Up to that moment he might have passed as a decent professor, but the presence of Isaac -- and the joy of the house in honour of Isaac -- exposed him in his true character. He was unmasked; his heart was laid bare; he was discovered to be a *mocker*.
Can this be a picture of some person here tonight? Yes! you may be a decent professor of religion, you may say your daily prayers and read your daily chapter, and be found every Sunday at church, chapel or meeting room, and yet have *no delight in Christ*! You may be able to sustain a conversation on religious topics in general, but if any one wants to speak of *Christ* you feel awkward and at a loss! You think out-and-out Christians are odd, peculiar and somewhat
{41}
fanatical. You wish people would not make so much fuss about spiritual matters. Ah, if one ray of the glory of Christ had ever shone into your heart how differently you would think of things! The awful fact is you are an entire stranger to God's grace and to the Lord Jesus Christ.
But God knows how to awaken a sense of need even in the conscience and heart of a mocker. Ishmael and his mother were driven out of Abraham's house to learn in the desert the poverty of all their resources. And it seems to me we have a picture of human life in verses 14 - 16. Hagar and Ishmael started on their journey with bread and a bottle of water. All start in life with certain abilities and resources for which they are indebted to God -- health, strength, natural powers and capacities of different kinds. These things supply a limited fund of resources to man. They yield for a time a certain kind of satisfaction, or rather gratification. At first no lack is felt. Draughts of pleasure abound in childhood and youth, but every one is a drain on a reservoir of limited dimensions. The store in the bottle gets less and less. Very often as a man's wealth increases, and he has enlarged means to gratify himself, his pleasure and satisfaction diminish. As life advances, satisfaction recedes from the heart. The bottle gets emptier with every draught, until the last drop is drained, and the sinner left face to face with *death*.
What an end to "the pleasures of life"! What a mockery earth's greatness and pleasures seem when we see them leading to *death*! Unconverted friend, death, judgment, and eternity are before you, and if this lays hold of you it will make you think differently of everything. Ishmael was brought face to face with death, and he had to find that he could not help himself. He lay helpless under a shrub and his mother left him to die. Ah, the bottle was empty indeed! You will come to this some day. You will have no power to retain the spirit, and those who love you best on earth will not be able to help you.
Another thing we may notice. Hagar was a type of the law (@Galatians 4), and she could not avert the death of the child. The
{42}
law cannot save or help a sinner. The priest and Levite in @Luke 10 -- typical of the ceremonial and moral law -- could not help the man who was naked, wounded and half-dead. Such a one needs not the claim of law but the gift of grace. He needs the salvation of God. Ishmael in his extremity was shut up to God, and from verse 17 it appears that he cried to God. "And God heard the voice of the lad ... and God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the flask with water, and gave the lad drink". A source of life and blessing provided by God was close at hand, but Hagar's eyes had to be opened to see it. There is "a well of water" today available for all. The Son of God has come into this world and has died that He might become in resurrection the divine Source of life and blessing for man. Though we have forfeited everything by our sin and have justly fallen under death and judgment, divine love has undertaken for us. The Lord Jesus has come into our place as made sin upon the cross, and He has so glorified God as to sin that on the divine side there is no barrier to the blessing of every sinner under heaven.
And, further, not only is the way of blessing open for man by the death of Christ, and through faith in His Name, but that way of blessing has been opened in such a manner as to *make God known* to His poor creatures who have been estranged from Him by sin. His holy hatred of sin has been made known, His righteousness manifested in dealing with it, His love, grace and boundless mercy toward man have been expressed in the gift of His only-begotten Son, and His power set forth in raising up the Lord Jesus from the dead when all had been accomplished. There is not a single attribute of God that has not been vindicated at the cross, and His blessed nature of holy love has fully expressed itself.
Now the glory of the gospel is that all this is set forth therein so that God may be known by men as a Saviour God. We are under death, but God comes to us there by sending His Son to die, so that we might enter into life by being
{43}
brought to know Him. The water of life which God is giving freely to every one that thirsts is the knowledge of Himself. There was but one way in which God could make Himself known to men, and that was by the gift and death of His Son. The Son of God is the "well of water", and whosoever will may believe on Him and "take the water of life freely". Alas! to multitudes in christian England these are mere commonplaces of Bible teaching! They see nothing wonderful, blessed and worthy of God in it. It produces no exercise -- in some cases hardly occupies a passing thought. Alas for such! They are, indeed, utterly dead towards God.
In @Genesis 22 God requires Abraham to offer up Isaac "for a burnt-offering". The burnt-offering was an offering which went up altogether as a sweet-smelling savour to God, and it was for the *acceptance* of the offerer. It sets forth the ground on which God sets His called and chosen saints before Him for His own glory, and for the gratification of His own heart. But before we consider the burnt-offering it may be as well to look briefly at the sin-offering, for if we do not know the efficacy of the latter we shall hardly be prepared to enter into the blessedness of the former. Read @Leviticus 4: 1 - 12.
The first thing I call your attention to is that the offerer identified himself with the victim by laying his hand upon its head. It was as much as to say, 'This bullock dies for *me*'. Have you ever thus identified yourself by faith with the death of Christ? Of course it is impossible to do so until you see how He has in grace identified Himself with you by coming under that to which you were liable by reason of sin. I should like you to think of three things: your position, your practice and your prospect.
The fall brought about an immense change in man's position. Before any judgment was executed, or one word had been said by God about what had happened, Adam and Eve hid themselves behind the trees of the garden. God had to ask the question, "Where art thou?" Sin had put distance
{44}
between God and man, and this distance remains. Every unconverted man is "far off" from God; he dwells in a "far country" of alienation from God.
Then our practice was consistent with our position. As sinners alienated from God we walked in trespasses and sins, "according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience: among whom we also all once had our conversation in the lusts of our flesh, doing what the flesh and the thoughts willed to do, and were children, by nature, of wrath, even as the rest" (@Ephesians 2: 1 - 3).
Occupying such a position and characterised by such a practice, what could be our prospect? It is declared in the words, "Dust thou art; and unto dust shalt thou return" (@Genesis 3: 19). "The wages of sin is death" (@Romans 6: 23). All our greatness and pleasure ends in death, after which there is the judgment of God upon us for the deeds done in the body, when we shall be judged according to our works (@Revelation 20: 13).
Now let us see how perfectly the Lord Jesus has identified Himself with us in wondrous grace and love. I trust it is clear to every one of us that the Lord Jesus "knew no sin". From the manger to the cross He was ever an object of deepest delight to the heart of God. His position was a perfect contrast to that of the sons of Adam. But the bullock of the sin-offering had to go forth without the camp (@Leviticus 4: 12). It had to go into a position which denoted the distance at which man was from God by sin. "Wherefore also Jesus, that he might sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered without the gate" (@Hebrews 13: 12). The literal position "without the gate" was a type of the far-off place in which He became the Forsaken One for us, and had to cry as the Sin-bearer, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
Then not only had sin put distance between us and God, but our sins justly rendered us liable to His holy judgment. The fire by which the bullock of the sin-offering was consumed prefigured this. The Lord Jesus has endured that holy
{45}
judgment for us, bearing our sins in His own body on the tree, and suffering for them, the Just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God. If our history as children of Adam must close in death, how blessed to know that the Son of God has come into death for us, that in the place of our condemnation we might find not only divine love and grace in our favour, but divine righteousness also.
*The blood* is the witness of all this (@Leviticus 4: 6, 7). It bears witness *on God's side* of the vindication of all His attributes, and *to us* of complete purgation of sins so that we are in conscience "perfected for ever". "We have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of offences". We are perfectly cleared of everything that was against us before God; every accusation is silenced, every charge met, every sin gone. Such is the divine clearance of the believer.
But in connection with the burnt-offering we come to superlative grace (read @Leviticus 1: 1 - 9). It was "an offering by fire to Jehovah of a sweet odour". It sets forth Christ as the One who has "delivered himself up for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour" (@Ephesians 5: 2). Not only has Christ taken up our liabilities as sinners, but He has taken up the whole question of sin *for the glory of God*. Sin has been visited with holy judgment, but this has come to pass in the sacrifice of One who brought all the excellence and moral glory of His own Person into the place of that judgment. The greatness of His Person enabled Him to bear and exhaust that infinite judgment, but who can measure the perfect love, the absolute devotedness to God, the holy and unswerving obedience, the deep perfection of every motive of His heart under God's eye in that matchless offering of Himself? All this has gone up as a sweet-smelling savour to God. The glory of God is secured, but at the same time His heart has been gratified in an infinite way.
Notice, too, that the burnt-offering was an offering for *acceptance*. @Leviticus 1: 3 should read, "he shall present it *for his acceptance*", and verse 4 says, "it shall be accepted for him". The difference between the sin-offering and the burnt-
{46}
offering is plainly indicated by the terms used in connection with each. In connection with the sin-offering we read, "and it shall be *forgiven him*" (@Leviticus 4: 26, 31, 35), but in connection with the burnt-offering, "it shall be *accepted for him*". One is an offering for *clearance* and the other for *acceptance*.
If all the preciousness and sweet savour of Christ as brought out in the place of atonement are the ground of our acceptance, how infinite is that acceptance! God makes His called and chosen saints to be "accepted in the Beloved" (@Ephesians 1: 6), to "the praise of the glory of his grace". It is for the satisfaction of His own heart that God the Father is pleased to set His saints thus before Him in *sonship*. It is "according to the good pleasure of his will" that He will fill His house with a glorious company of "many sons". Thus on the ground of the burnt-offering God will gratify His own nature in having us in righteousness, joy and holy love before His face, "conformed to the image of his Son, so that he should be the firstborn among many brethren" (@Romans 8: 29).
Turning now to @Genesis 24 we come to a type of what the assembly is for *Christ*. *Man* gets the water of life, the *Father* gets many sons and *Christ* gets the church. The result of the servant's mission was that Isaac "took Rebecca, and she became his wife; and he loved her. And Isaac was comforted after the death of his mother" (verse 67). Israel, having rejected Christ, does not minister to His satisfaction. So far as the comfort and joy of Christ are concerned Israel is dead. And now in the time of His rejection by Israel He receives the church and she becomes the satisfaction of His heart according to the Father's purpose.
I cannot now enter into this, but I should like the youngest believer here to be impressed by the thought of what the assembly is to Christ. We have been separated from the world by God's grace and by His work in our souls, that we might come into a circle where the love of Christ is known. God's purpose in saving us was that we might be in the company of whom it is said, "Christ also loved the assembly, and has delivered himself up for it, in order that he might sanctify
{47}
it, purifying it by the washing of water by the word, that *he* might present the assembly to himself glorious, having no spot, or wrinkle, or any of such things; but that it might be holy and blameless" (@Ephesians 5: 25 - 27).
Christ has received the assembly for His own satisfaction and joy. He loves the assembly and has given Himself for it that He might have it altogether for Himself. And now His love is active towards it that He may have it in entire moral suitability to Himself. Everything that is of the world and of the flesh -- everything that is not morally "glorious" -- must be removed so that He may rest in His love. If the thought takes hold of our hearts that we are to be for the satisfaction of Christ it will put us on an entirely new line and give us a new estimate of everything. We shall be prepared to yield ourselves, if I may so say, to the activities of His sanctifying love so that everything about us which has not been wrought in us by God may be set aside. We shall not be reluctant to let the things of earth go if we understand that their going sets us more free to know the love of Christ. I venture to think that Rebecca thought more of the person she was going to than of the things she had to leave behind in order to reach him. As the love of Christ holds us, we are ready to leave without regret the things which once were necessary to us. And as we leave things here, we *prove* that there is infinite compensation in the love of Christ.
May God give every one of us to know that we are saved so that we may be of the assembly! That assembly for which Christ gave Himself, and which He sanctifies, that He may present it to Himself for the satisfaction of His own love!
{48}
THE GLORY OF THE SON OF GOD
@Psalm 2: 7 - 12; @Genesis 22: 1, 2; @Genesis 37: 3; @1 Chronicles 17: 11 - 15; @Isaiah 9: 6, 7; @Proverbs 30: 4
C.A.C. The great dignity of our Lord's Person as in manhood is that He is the Son of God, and the great end of all gift and ministry is that we should come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God. And God was pleased, before His Son was actually found upon earth, to give intimations in the Old Testament of the great thoughts that would be connected with Him as bearing that wondrous name. @Psalm 2 is the foundational scripture. It is perhaps the only scripture which directly attaches the title of Son to the Lord in the Old Testament. Therefore we do not wonder to find it quoted three times in the New Testament. There is something very impressive and striking in the fact that the Lord says prophetically, "I will declare the decree". I do not know that there is any other scripture quite like that. It is a remarkable word as indicating a fixed and unchangeable purpose on God's part. The great and marvellous reality that a divine Person would come into the world as Man, as born of a woman and bearing the title of Son of God, was the subject of an eternal "decree". Everything for God and man depended on it. God would have an anointed Man, and that Man would be His Son. Nothing else that ever happened, or that ever will happen, is so great as that which has been thus decreed. It was the outcome of God's determinate counsel, and He would have us to perceive the extraordinary greatness and dignity of this Person who should bear the title of Son of God. As born of the virgin He came into manhood and was addressed by God as His Son, begotten by Him. This took place on a particular day. That is, it is connected with time, not with eternity. "This day"; there was a specific
{49}
"day" when the Son was begotten. As seen by Nathanael, He was confessed as the One spoken of in @Psalm 2 -- the Son of God, the King of Israel. The prophetic statement of the psalm had become history when it was quoted in Hebrews l. The thing had come to pass; the decree, the eternal decree, had been carried into effect.
Ques. Is "the decree", then, connected with eternity, and the begetting of the "Son" with time?
C.A.C. Yes, the decree goes back to eternal purpose and counsel in view of all that God had in mind to accomplish for His own glory and the blessing of the creature. It is most establishing and confirmatory to faith to see that God has secured everything for His own glory and for man's blessing by this decree. All hangs on the coming of a divine Person into manhood, as born of the virgin. The incarnation, as one has said many years ago, is the unshakeable pillar of the moral universe.
Ques. What is the difference in the setting of Luke's gospel, and @John 1?
C.A.C. In Luke's gospel He is seen to have the glorious title of Son of God as found in the most lowly circumstances possible, as born of the virgin. His was the most humble nativity that possibly could be, but as contemplated in those lowly conditions He is spoken of as the Son of the Highest, and the Son of God. And as going with the repentant remnant to be baptised He was addressed by God as His beloved Son. It is as if the Spirit of God would clothe His humiliation with the greatest dignity and divine glory; "The holy thing also which shall be born shall be called Son of God". But in @John 1 we see the Lord distinctly in relation to divine Persons. John speaks of Him as the only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father. That is His relation to the Father, and John, having said that, did not need to tell us that the Father's voice came to Him. The other gospels tell us of the voice that came from the opened heaven and saluted Him as the beloved Son, but in John He does not need to be
{50}
saluted; He is there in the most intimate nearness of relationship and affection. And then the One who sent John to baptise told him that the Person upon whom the Holy Spirit would descend and abide upon Him was the One who would baptise with the Holy Spirit. He is in the bosom of the Father, and His relation with the Spirit is that the Spirit comes down and abides on Him. He was a perfect resting place for the Spirit, so that both the Father and the Spirit are seen as having complete complacency in the Son as Man upon this earth. It is very beautiful, and it is of the utmost importance for us to realise that all this is connected with Him as having come within the range of our apprehension. It is a divine Person who has come into manhood, who can be contemplated, who can be seen and heard and even handled. A blessed Person brought into this world -- begotten of God, His Son, His loved One -- but He is within our range. We can apprehend Him, we can know Him as having that blessed title and character.
Ques. How do we apprehend Him as Son of God?
C.A.C. The apprehension of Him as Son of God is the climax of what is spiritually possible. We have in @John 9 a marvellous picture of a man who traversed what Mr. Stoney used to call steps in light; he got his eyes opened, and then he took steps in light. He took one step after another in the deepening knowledge of the One who had opened his eyes, until that One said to him, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?" That was the climax. "Who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?" "Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he". The result was worship; he became a worshipper of the Son of God, and we cannot really contemplate that Person without becoming worshippers. It is not a question of getting thoughts and ideas, but He is so glorious, so wondrous, He has such dignity, and yet withal He is so near to us in love that if we see Him at all we must worship Him.
Ques. Is that the end of all the New Testament Scriptures?
{51}
C.A.C. Yes, it is. Paul and John coalesce in the presentation to our faith and affections of the Son of God.
Ques. Does he remain as Son of God in manhood for ever?
C.A.C. Surely. Having come into manhood He never gives it up. So that as the Son He will eternally be placed in subjection, which shows that the Lord will never divest Himself of that peculiar glory which He has taken up in becoming Son of God in manhood, because if He did He would be invisible to us. But having become Man, and having become Son of God in manhood, He remains for ever Man, the object for our affections and our adoration. He is within our range as Man; that is His mediatorial glory.
Ques. So that you would say that God has come within our reach?
C.A.C. Yes, through the Mediator, who was as Man the only-begotten Son in the bosom of the Father. There could not possibly be anything more intimate or more affectionate than the relation between that blessed Man and the Father. And it is said of that blessed One that He dwelt among us -- He tabernacled among us. He came into the most blessed nearness to man, so that the great chasm that was between God and the creature is completely removed in the Mediator.
Ques. A new relation in time?
C.A.C. Yes, it is. The Spirit presents Him to us as a blessed Man in unique relation to God; no other man ever had the relation to God that He had; He was the only-begotten Son. Isaac is a type of Him in that character; Isaac is called Abraham's only-begotten son in @Hebrews 11, though as a matter of fact Abraham had other sons, but the Spirit of God, having Christ in mind, will not recognise any other son of Abraham's but Isaac. So the blessed God says to him, "thine only son, whom thou lovest, Isaac"; God takes no account of Ishmael. And the reason was the supernatural character of his birth. Isaac was the child of promise and of resurrection power; he was born entirely apart from the
{52}
natural course of events, and in that way he was typical of the miraculous conception and birth of the Son of God who was the only-begotten Son. Isaac was the heir; he was typical of the One who, as loved by the Father, can take up all the wealth of God and hold it so that it may be available for men; but nothing could be taken up except on the ground of His death. And so this great thought is connected with the only son in @Genesis 22, that he is to be offered up as a burnt-offering. As the Heir the Son of God had personal title to take up every thought of God in relation to man, but then, if He were to be divine blessing for others He must take all upon the ground of death, and so He has been offered up. "He who, yea, has not spared his own Son, but delivered him up for us all". We who had no personal title can be blessed in Him; our title is established by Another and in Another.
Ques. Is that the great thought in connection with Jehovah's word to Abraham to offer up his only son?
C.A.C. It must have meant very much to the blessed God to say that to Abraham, knowing that it was what He was going to do Himself. It is most important for us to get a great thought of the delight of God in that blessed Man, the absolute complacency of God in Him. "In thee I have found my delight"; it was that One who was wholly for God's delight that has not been spared, He has been delivered up for us all. That is not a transaction taking place in the depths of Deity; it is a blessed Man, given in divine love, who comes within our view. We see the loved Son, we see what He is for the delight of God, and then we see the love of God manifested in that He was offered up.
Ques. Would that command of God to Abraham set forth typically in time the decree that was in eternity?
C.A.C. Yes, surely. And so Isaac is a type of Christ as the only-begotten Son, and the Heir, and the One who is offered up, and who subsequently gets a wife of His own kindred. Thus Isaac is peculiarly a type of the sonship of the Lord Jesus Christ as saints of the assembly know Him. In
{53}
@Psalm 2 we do not get all that, but we find that the One who is begotten is going to have the ends of the earth for His possession, and He is going to subjugate all His enemies. All will have to be subject to Him, and He is the One in whom men may put their trust. Men are called upon to kiss the Son, but we do not get His offering up in @Psalm 2, or His getting a wife as in @Genesis 24.
Ques. In Hebrews where the greatness of the Person is set out, we are exhorted to give special attention to what we have heard. Would that be the greatness of the Person come into manhood?
C.A.C. The great point in @Hebrews 1 is that God has spoken in the Son, in this great Personage, and all blessing and all knowledge of God depends upon our listening to the Speaker.
Ques. When it says "Heir of all things", is that the thought of @Psalm 2?
C.A.C. In @Psalm 2 He gets the ends of the earth for His possession, but "Heir of all things" goes very wide; He is appointed Heir of all things, which brings in heaven as well as earth. Everything is to be inherited by Him; as Son of God He is great enough to be Heir of all things. As Heir of all things He gets a wife; the assembly is brought in to share the inheritance with Him, and that is how we come into all the wealth of God. The wealth of God consists in the thoughts of His love, and there is One in manhood great enough to inherit that, and He has gone into death in order that those who have no personal title to inherit anything shall on a righteous ground inherit with Him. All that He takes up as the Heir He is going to share with the joint-heirs. So that the greater sense we have of His dignity the more sure we are of the immensity of the inheritance which we share with Him.
Ques. How are we to understand @John 13 -- being in His bosom?
C.A.C. The bosom of the Son is open to those who love Him; they can have the most intimate place; there is nothing
{54}
to hinder any one of us from being there. The only thing that is wanted is love -- do we love Him enough to want to be there? You may say, 'There are things about me that would not suit that place'; well, He will serve to remove all the things that would hinder us from being there, if we want to be there. What a blessed Person He is!
Isaac is typically Christ as the only-begotten Son and the Heir, and as the One in whom all nations are to bless themselves. We can only bless ourselves in Him. He gets a wife of those who are blessed in Him. Then the thought of pre-eminence is very much presented by the Spirit in Joseph; he is seen to be pre-eminent in his father's love; we are told Israel loved him more than all his sons, and he made him a vest of many colours. He is seen to be publicly distinguished as pre-eminent in his father's love. We can all see how beautifully that type was worked out in the Son of God. How God delighted to put distinction upon Him -- His works and His moral perfection and all the way that He carried Himself before men. The Father's voice and the descent of the Spirit were all like a vest of many colours; they spoke of the pre-eminent place that He had in the Father's love.
We get in Joseph the thought of a pre-eminence that is acquired. Joseph acquired by his own worth his place of pre-eminence. Now that glory is very precious in the Son of God. Joseph by the excellence of the wisdom in which he could do things rose from the lowest point to the highest, and so great was that wisdom that he became the sustainer of life for his brethren and the whole world. Now the Lord has acquired pre-eminence in the affections of His saints by the extraordinary ability and wisdom which have been disclosed in Him to meet every conceivable need on our part. That is how He becomes pre-eminent and gets His place as Head with every one of us; it is by our seeing the extraordinary wisdom with which He can give effect to every blessed thought that was in the heart of God concerning us. When we see that, we not only believe that He is Head and accept the truth of it, but He acquires that place in our affections, and I believe
{55}
that is a point of the very greatest importance. Joseph's brethren began by hating him because of his pre-eminence in the father's love, but they ended by being subdued to accepting his pre-eminence by discovering his ability to preserve them in life; they had been absolutely shut up to him. There was no other to whom they could turn; and every one who knows what it is to have life in the name of the Son of God will say He must be pre-eminent. How could I have life in His name and not accord Him the place of pre-eminence? When the Lord fed the multitude He was giving a little presentation of His ability to satisfy men, to bring men into life. As knowing Him thus He acquires the place of pre-eminence with us all. There is no part of His glory to be known by Israel in a coming day that is hidden from the assembly today; every ray of His glory that will shine out in the kingdom or in eternity is available for the saints of the assembly, because the assembly is His fulness. If there was something of His glory that was not known in the assembly, there would be an element of His fulness wanting, but the assembly is the fulness of Him who fills all in all. That shows clearly that every part of His glory should be the conscious possession and wealth of the assembly. His future glory is seen typically in Solomon: Isaac and Joseph and Solomon are the three great types of the sonship of our Lord Jesus Christ in the Old Testament, and it is evident that in each case they are types of what He is in manhood.
Solomon is a type of Him as the One whose kingdom will be established for ever. He will be established in Jehovah's house and kingdom for ever, and He will be Son of God in that relation. The kingdom will all be ordered, and every one of its features will be brought into being and maintained in being by One who is in the relation and dignity of Son. "I will be his father, and he shall be my son".
Rem. The Spirit seems to be specially bringing all this before us at the present time.
C.A.C. I believe that is so, and it will lead, under the hand of God, to great enlargement in the knowledge of the
{56}
Son of God. The scriptures we have read show how great this Person is. The Spirit of God is here to glorify Him, to magnify His honours and dignities to the utmost; certainly not to take anything from Him, but to invest Him with every glory that rightly belongs to Him. His glories are such that they could only attach to a divine Person; they are such that if He were not absolutely God in the fullest sense it would be a moral impossibility for them to attach to Him.
We read in @Isaiah 9 that "unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given". As the Child born He is the lowly One who did not disdain to come into the world at the lowest point of human weakness -- to be born of a woman. But as the Son given He comes to be the great evidence of God's favour to men, and to take up the government, so that divine rule may be brought in and established for ever where lawlessness has so long prevailed. The titles given here are titles of government, bringing out His ability to order everything here for the glory of God. But the Son is given: whatever greatness is bound up in the Son of God it is given to us. The great proof of the love of God to the world is that He gave His only-begotten Son. He was Himself standing there before Nicodemus when He said those blessed words that "God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son". The only-begotten Son was present before the eyes of Nicodemus -- the manifestation of the love of God in manhood; and we are welcome to appropriate Him in His greatness, which is expressed in His name. "His name is called Wonderful"; there is inscrutability about it; we can never fathom it. His Person is so great that no one knows Him but the Father. And then He is "Counsellor"; this sets forth the wisdom that is in Him to carry out in fulness and in permanence every thought of divine love. And He is the "Mighty God"; He is, as we have it in one of our hymns, "of full Deity possessed" (`11:2). And He is the "Father of Eternity"; we love to think that the coming age is going to derive its character and its blessedness from the Son. He will impress His own character, His own parentage, upon every part of the vast scene of glory, He
{57}
is the *Father of Eternity*. What pleasure God will have as having a Son who can bring into being, and sustain in being, a universe of bliss for His glory! And then He is the "Prince of Peace". All these blessed and divine titles attach to Him in manhood. We could never penetrate the depths of unseen Deity, but God has been pleased to make known all that can be known of Him by creatures as bringing it within our reach in His Son in manhood. The holy secrets and the fulness of the heart of God have come to light in a Man; they are thus available to us. Most marvellous realities have taken place on the platform of the world and in time. The apostles had seen it; it was not something that took place behind the scenes in eternity, but "We have seen, and testify, that the Father has sent the Son as Saviour of the world" (@1 John 4: 14). Do not let us give that up; it is vital to the very constitution of christianity that we should see the greatness of the place of the Son of God in manhood.
@Proverbs 30 brings us in a certain sense to the climax of it. It is a prophecy; I do not know that there is any more remarkable prophecy in the Old Testament than the verse we read together -- "What is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou knowest?" That verse should have given the Jews a great subject of consideration, because it suggested that there was a Name which was as yet unrevealed. Agur knew the name Jehovah but in raising the question, "What is his name?" he suggests that there was a Name to be enquired into, to be thought of, which was as yet unknown -- a Name that would only come out through the presence upon earth of the Son of God. The very fact of One being here having the name of Son brought out that the name of Father belongs to God; the very suggestion that God has a Son had wrapped up in it the making known of God as Father; if there was to be a blessed Man in the relationship of Son to God, it involved the making known of a Name that was never known before -- the name of Father. That is the climax of the truth connected with the name or title of Son; it brings to light the full revelation of the blessed God as the Father. And, as we well know,
{58}
the making known of the Father's name is linked in @John 20 with the Son of God known as the ascending One. It is the Son of God as the One about to ascend who sent the wonderful message to His brethren by Mary Magdalene. That is, we get divine thoughts realised in their most lofty and heavenly character and fulness.
In Isaac we see the Lord as the risen One, in Joseph we see Him as the exalted One, in Solomon we see Him as the supreme One in the kingdom, but in @Proverbs 30 we get the thought of ascension. How wonderful the thoughts of God are! How perfectly Scripture hangs together! We have, in an obscure way I admit, but definitely given by the Holy Spirit as a prophecy, the thought of One who ascends up into the heavens -- who goes up to the very highest place, and who goes there because He first descended. It is remarkable that it speaks of His ascending first and then of His descending; the One who ascended could only do so because He first descended. The whole truth of His divine personality is there. He came down in a marvellous descent of infinite love, and brought all that belonged to heaven with Him -- He went to the cross and was offered up, and as risen then He ascended up where He was before. The greatness of His person comes out in that He could descend, and then ascend up where He was before. We read all the Lord's history here in the light of this. He was from above, and is therefore "above all" (@John 3). And as the ascending One He made known to His brethren the most exalted name of God, the most affectionate Name that was ever made known to men. He can bring the Father's name to us, and put it in our hearts, and make it by the Spirit the spring of affectionate response now and throughout eternity; the greatness of the Son comes out in His ability to do this.
Ques. What is life in John?
C.A.C. If we get the blessed Son of God before our hearts in His wonderful character and dignity we shall know something of what life is. "These are written that ye may
{59}
believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name" (@John 20: 31). This glorious Person is definitely given to us as an Object of faith and love, and as He becomes our Object we have life in His name; we live in all that which He has brought to us as the blessed gift of God.
JOSEPH'S SILVER CUP
@Genesis 44: 15
"Did ye not know that such a man as I can certainly divine?" Yes, Joseph could indeed divine -- little as his brethren apprehended his meaning.
His method of divining was far removed from that of the Egyptian magicians and soothsayers, with their enchantments to deceive by cunning, and often satanic, devices and magic arts.
In @Daniel 2, we have a remarkable and instructive account of the exposure and conviction of this class of men, with their pretence to occult powers; and the consequent bringing in of Daniel, who, like Joseph, was the true 'revealer of secrets', as having been enlightened and instructed in divine wisdom; so that God was acknowledged and glorified in the result.
Joseph was indeed truly divining, searching out and bringing to light what was the present mind of his brethren, and as to how far their consciences had been awakened as to their former conduct.
To this end he uses his cup, his silver cup, with admirable skill and design. That his cup was "my ... silver cup" (verse 2) seems to be not without significance. Silver surely may be taken as typical of grace, a symbol of it, for us the redemptive saving grace of God, revealed in and by our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom Joseph was such a striking type; for Jesus
{60}
was pre-eminently 'the Revealer of secrets' (see @John 1: 48; @John 4: 29 as examples), "The Saviour of the world" (@John 4: 42), so that the new name given to Joseph -- Zaphnath-paaneah (@Genesis 41: 45) with its double meaning 'Revealer of secrets' and 'Saviour of the world'- was fully and absolutely descriptive of Him, and of Him alone. Again we may surely take Joseph's actions and words, by which he searched out and brought into evidence, and in great measure produced, the exercises of his brethren's consciences and hearts, as portraying what the Lord (as Son of Man) declares as to Himself in @Revelation 2: 23, "And all the assemblies shall know that I am he that searches the reins and the hearts", a deeply important truth for our souls.
Let us also bear in mind for our comfort and profit that in these actions of Joseph which we are considering he is not only a type or figure of Christ, but we see in him the spirit and mind of Christ, shining out in a beautiful and precious way, both in his words and in his actions.
Joseph's words, indeed, at times seemed harsh, "He spoke roughly unto them", and some of his dealings appeared severe; but he had one definite object and end before him in it all, which was, as we know, that when they were humbled and subdued, he might lavish his love upon them and have them in enjoyed nearness to himself -- fear and distance removed, so far as he could effect it. But the probing and testing must come first, to lead them to repentance and confession as regarding the past. When this is effected, the pent-up feelings of Joseph in yearning love can be expressed; and his delight was to say, "Come near to me, I pray you", speaking to their hearts and giving them the kiss of reconciliation and love, and finding his joy in so doing.
In all this, was it not indeed the spirit and mind of Christ in Joseph, enabling him to "overcome evil with good" (@Romans 12: 21)? We know from the prophetic word how, in a future day, the blessed Lord Himself -- the true Joseph, as we speak -- will with His earthly people Israel repeat and accomplish in the fullest and most blessed way all that which is typified and
{61}
shadowed forth so admirably in Joseph. His (the Lord's) brethren, as He will call them in marvellous and infinite grace, He will deal with in perfect wisdom and love, first to bring them to repentance and mourning and confession; as so graphically described in @Zephaniah 12: 10: "And I will pour upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplications; and they shall look on me whom they pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for an only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn". "And one shall say unto him, What are those wounds in thy hands? And he will say, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends" (chapter 13: 6); and in verse 9: "And I will bring the third part into the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried. They shall call on my name, and I will answer them: I will say, It is my people; and they shall say, Jehovah is my God", and thus leading on to, and making possible, the fulfilment of these prophetic words of exquisite beauty and preciousness in @Zephaniah 3: 17 addressed by the prophet to Israel. "Jehovah ... will save: he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love; he will exult over thee with singing".
Yes, Joseph's way with his brethren is indeed typical and illustrative of the manner in which that chosen and elect nation will be brought to full confession of all their guilt, and to true repentance under the hand and dealings of the Lord; who "shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver" (@Malachi 3: 3), for His dealings will be on the line of, and characterised by, redemptive grace; as we read elsewhere: "The ransomed of Jehovah shall return" (@Isaiah 35: 10). "And he will redeem Israel from all his iniquities" (@Psalm 130: 8).
There are also, however, important differences (never to be lost sight of) between what we have dwelt upon in the case of Joseph, and the Lord's dealings in a future day to bring Israel back to Himself; gathering them as "the great shepherd of the sheep" (@Hebrews 13: 20) -- in their case, "the lost
{62}
sheep of Israel's house" (@Matthew 15: 24); and we may happily add, as gathering now, and during these last nineteen hundred years, the "other sheep" (@John 10: 16) -- the elect of God out of that nation, and from among the Gentiles, for a heavenly portion and heavenly joys. Joseph, like Moses, may be a servant in God's house, and as such found faithful, "but Christ, as Son over his (God's) house" (@Hebrews 3: 6), and thus surpassingly more glorious than Joseph or Moses. Joseph needed to use "the silver cup" (chapter 44: 2), and various other means to divine the true state of his brethren's hearts, and he acted with admirable skill and wisdom, as taught of God. We have also seen that while in love he yearns over them, and specially over Benjamin, yet he will not disclose himself nor gratify his love until he has 'divined' and searched out their inward feelings and exercises of heart; and who can read the touching confession, the eloquent appeal of Judah on behalf of Benjamin, without being deeply moved, and responsively appreciate Joseph's feelings and attitude, when all was found out? He can now commit himself to them, and declare himself as "Joseph your brother" (chapter 45: 4). Beautiful indeed! even as inspired history, is all this; and precious to see in Joseph the spirit of Christ displaying itself so touchingly in tender forgiving love, in a man "of like passions" (@Acts 14: 15). Would that we were possessed and controlled more by a similar unselfish mind and spirit, for the outshining of the mind "which was in Christ Jesus" (@Philippians 2: 5). But it is in Jesus only, as in @Philippians 2, that we have fully displayed what we see in part in Joseph and others, and, as regards them, entirely the fruit of the work of God in them, wrought by the Holy Spirit, and not any grace or virtue in them nor in any other naturally. Such fruit never grew in nature's garden. "I am the vine" ("the true vine") (@John 15: 1, 5) said the Lord to His disciples, and again, "As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abide in the vine, thus neither can ye unless ye abide in me" (verse 4). 'Dead works' there may be, which are but an attempt at imitation by fleshly piety: "Let no one fraudulently deprive you of
{63}
your prize, doing his own will in humility and worship of angels, entering into things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by the mind of his flesh". "Which have indeed an appearance of wisdom in voluntary worship, and humility, and harsh treatment of the body, not in a certain honour, to the satisfaction of the flesh" (@Colossians 2: 18, 23). These are like artificial flowers and fruit; but no fruit for God can there ever be apart from being born again, born of God; and so, as being the subjects of the work in us of the Holy Spirit, it is a great point reached in our history when we say from our hearts,
<blockquote>'Nothing that's good have we, <br>Nothing apart from Thee, <br>Jesus, our Lord'. </blockquote>
This may appear a digression from the subject we are considering, but it is really intimately connected with it. God was from the very first finding pleasure in any and every expression of the spirit of Christ in His people; but, in every case, it was the fruit of the work of the Holy Spirit (in sovereign grace) in order that some of the beautiful moral features of Christ should be displayed, well pleasing in His (God's) sight: "The God of peace ... perfect you in every good work to the doing of his will, doing in you what is pleasing before him through Jesus Christ" (@Hebrews 13: 20, 21).
Yet, in some ways, as we have already intimated, how instructive and important are the points of contrast between Joseph's way of reaching right conclusions as to his brethren, and the perfect knowledge of all things and persons which we see in the Lord Jesus.
The Spirit by the evangelist bears testimony to Him, that "he knew all men, and that he had not need that any should testify of man, for himself knew what was in man" (@John 2: 24, 25). We have also the precious testimony of the woman of Samaria (already alluded to), "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done: is not he the Christ?" (@John 4: 29). And though He would not, as being unsuited to the
{64}
dignity of His glorious Person, and the marvellous lowliness to which He condescended, use words such as Joseph used: "Did ye not know that such a man as I can certainly divine?", He could, and did, in matchless tenderness and love, say to that poor woman, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water" (@John 4: 10). Here, indeed, is the 'glory that excelleth', for it is the glory of perfect divine grace and love. He knew perfectly all the history of that unhappy woman; and He dealt with her conscience and heart in a manner as gracious and tender as it was searching and convicting, preparing her for that wonderful revelation of Himself to her: "I who speak to thee am he" (verse 26). And has He not searched and tried us, letting the light shine in that showed us what we were that He might reveal to us what He is, so as to attach us to Himself? Yes! blessed Lord, we joy to look up to Thee now in that place of supreme exaltation and honour where Thou art now, and say to Thee with adoring hearts,
<blockquote>'In Thy blest face all glories shine, <br>And there we gaze on love divine'. (`68:2)</blockquote>
As Man here on earth, He was the Vessel of all the fulness of God's grace, "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us ... full of grace and truth" (@John 1: 14). We who have believed on Him have received "of his fulness ..., and grace upon grace" (@John 1: 16). We ought surely, therefore, not come behind those Old Testament saints in showing forth now the grace and compassion of Jesus and His spirit and moral features, and so be found walking more "as he walked" (@John 1: 36).
He, not Joseph, is our divine and perfect pattern. In full and perfect love He "gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all lawlessness, and purify to himself a peculiar people (that is, a company peculiarly 'His own'), zealous for good works" (@Titus 2: 14).
{65}
He can be, to each one of us, what Joseph could never be to his brethren, for with him were many limitations, but none with Jesus! who is able "to subdue all things to himself" (@Philippians 3: 21). We have ever His priestly service, His sympathy in every sorrow, and even if we sin, "We have a patron with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous" (@1 John 2: 1). If we are tired and cast down, He can encourage our hearts with the assurance, "My grace suffices thee; for my power is perfected in weakness" (@2 Corinthians 12: 9). Our sense of conscious weakness casts us on His strength, so that 'His strength shall be ours on the road'.
In the closing verses of @Isaiah 40, we find how all this can be made available, as also in @Philippians 4. What blessed secrets these two scriptures contain for us, and what rich instruction there is in all the Old Testament Scriptures, all "written for our instruction, that through endurance and through encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope" (@Romans 15: 4). May we know how to interpret and apply them rightly and value them more.
But this is not all that which the Spirit would teach us in this interesting history of Joseph and his dealings with his brethren, for, while we rightly admire the spirit in which he acted towards them, and may well desire to move on the same lines "through ... the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ" (@Philippians 1: 19), yet we must also remember, and take account of the fact, that we were once in the spiritual state indicated by Joseph's brethren. We "once were alienated and enemies in mind by wicked works" (@Colossians 1: 21). See also @Titus 3: 3. "We were once ourselves also without intelligence, disobedient, wandering in error, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another". As with these men, and like the younger son in @Luke 15, it needed a famine (with us, a soul famine) to arouse us, and then other dealings of God -- often mysterious and perhaps painful -- to produce the right exercises of conscience and soul, so as to compel us to turn to God. Thus it
{66}
was His goodness led us to repentance and confession. How beautifully and perfectly we have all this -- both our guilty perishing condition, and the compassion and love of God -- portrayed by the Lord Jesus in @Luke 15 already referred to, where the activities in love of the whole Godhead are pictured -- the seeking -- the finding, the repentance -- the rejoicing over the repentant sinner and the never-ending joy in the father's house. Yes! marvellous indeed and most blessed for us to know that "there is joy before the angels of God for one repenting sinner" (verse 10); and that 'It is the Father's joy to bless'.
All these ways of divine love towards us have then, for their object, to bring us into, and make us participators of, all the wealth of blessing, all the joy and glory and honour which that love had long before provided and treasured up for us.
'Trembling, we had hoped for mercy Some lone place within the door, But the crown, the throne, the mansion, All were purposed long before'.
As we apprehend this and ponder over it, and look back to see all the way by which our gracious God has led us (which, at the time, we knew not) to bring us to the knowledge of Christ, and of His fulness to meet all our need and misery (for "of his fulness we all have received", @John 1: 16), we can then use, as expressive of our own personal experience, the words of the apostle in @Romans 5: 11, "And not only that, but we are making our boast in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ". The time is fast approaching too, when, for those of His earthly people Israel, who will then, through His sovereign mercy, His governmental dealings with them, and His work in them by His Spirit, have been brought to repentance, and to fear the Lord and think upon His Name (@Malachi 3: 16), "The Sun of righteousness (will) arise with healing in his wings" (@Malachi 4: 2); when, for them, will be fulfilled the ancient and glorious prophecy in @Deuteronomy 33: 28, 29, "Israel shall dwell in safety alone, The fountain of Jacob, in a
{67}
land of corn and new wine; Also his heavens shall drop down dew. Happy art thou, Israel! Who is like unto thee, a people saved by Jehovah?" Theirs will clearly be blessing on the earth, and earthly in character, under the blessings of the new covenant, foretold long before in the prophets, secured by the precious blood of Jesus, even as He said: "This is my blood, that of the new covenant, that shed for many for remission of sins" (@Matthew 26: 28). Hence the promise of the covenant was, "Their sins and their lawlessnesses I will never remember any more" (@Hebrews 8: 12). For us, too, that precious blood was shed, and we are now justified by the efficacy (the power) of that blood, and "reconciled to God through the death of his Son", with the blessed assurance that having been thus reconciled, when enemies, "we shall be saved in the power of his life" (@Romans 5: 10). Have we not an illustration, and so far an explanation of this latter truth, in the story of Joseph and his brethren? His brethren and his father's house were assuredly saved by his life -- his life, too, after he had been down in the depths of sorrow and bitterness, when the iron entered into his soul; and they the cause and instruments of it. Now raised up and exalted, having the power and glory of Egypt given to him, he can and will, as his chief service and joy, save his brethren and all his father's house through the famine time, and preserve and deliver them from every hostile element. But more, he will have them near himself, for the satisfaction of his love, and for his ministry to them, for, said he, "There will I maintain thee" (@Genesis 45: 11).
Thus, I think, we have a picture or type of what is meant by "we shall be saved in the power of his life" (@Romans 5: 10), for have we not the present ceaseless activities of the life of Christ and His shepherd care, previously described in such detail in @Psalm 23? The believer, whose conscience and heart are in the light and confidence of all this, can take up and appropriate the triumphant challenge of the apostle in @Romans 8: 35, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?" and declare, like him, his persuasion that "neither
{68}
death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord" (verses 38, 39).
May all this precious confidence in the perfect unchanging love of divine Persons (of the Father and the Son, for so John presents it) be the enjoyed portion and repose of our hearts.
In this respect we would be found unlike Joseph's brethren, who, after years of the experience of Joseph's tender love and care, still cherished fear and suspicion in their hearts and minds -- very grieving to the heart of Joseph (see @Genesis 50: 15 - 17). They were not "perfect as to conscience" (@Hebrews 9: 9).

DIVINE RESOURCES IN THE WILDERNESS
@Exodus 15: 20 - 27; @Exodus 16: 16 - 26
C.A.C. I suppose your thought was for us to look at the divine resources for the people of God in the wilderness?
Ques. I wanted a little light on what Marah is. Do you think the apprehension of Marah prepares us for the manna?
C.A.C. It is an immense thing for us to see we have our place with God on the ground of death and resurrection. That is a simple statement, but it is of fundamental importance, and it gives character to all the exercises of saints. Redemption has really separated us from the world, and the measure of our separation is the death and resurrection of Christ.
Ques. Then is Marah the learning of that practically?
C.A.C. Yes, it has been said that we have to drink the waters of death. The waters of the Red Sea were a wall on the right hand and on the left; we are sheltered and protected by death, and if that is so, we must be prepared to taste it.
Rem. We are fitted for that by finding that God is for us.
C.A.C. Yes, we are really under the cloud (@1 Corinthians 10: 1). The cloud is @Romans 5, and the sea is @Romans 6. If we do not know the blessedness of being under the cloud, how can we accept the sea? How could you bear to look at death, or taste it, if you have not seen the cloud? The cloud is God's favour, the consciousness that God is for me. God intervened on behalf of His people and covered them. 'He stands between us and the foe'. We believe on God, who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead. That is the God we know, the God of resurrection power, opening for us a new position, and if that is so, I must take up new ground. Marah is that you must
{72}
taste death to the old life, in order to get new resources and power in a new life.
Ques. Is that not @Romans 8?
C.A.C. @Romans 8 is the wilderness according to God, and the saints in the happy consciousness that God is for us, Christ is for us, and the Spirit is for us. If divine Persons are all for us, what a pledge of all good, and what a security against all evil!
It is remarkable that God, who provided Moses as a deliverer, provided Miriam as a responder. We get the three spoken of -- Moses, Aaron, and Miriam -- as leading. Moses the apostle, Aaron the priest, and Miriam who represents the response in affection. You must have all three. When God establishes the new covenant, the people have joy and thanksgiving. Joy and thankfulness are their only business. J.B.S. used to say that people never got the good of the manna till they passed the brazen serpent, but I think if the Israelites had proved the statute and ordinance of Marah, if they had accepted the statute made for them, they would not have needed to come under law.
Ques. What is the statute?
C.A.C. Christ is the statute; that is, you really accept that you are to be in this world in the path of Christ, and that means death to all the old life. What God is, is the statute and ordinance. I think in the ways of God, we are tested and proved by coming to something that is death to our natural taste and will. After knowing redemption, and coming into the triumph of God, a Christian will not go far before he is tested by something that is death to his natural taste and will.
Rem. It is not pleasant.
C.A.C. No, it is "bitter". Unless you have Christ before you, it is impossible to drink death.
Ques. Is the wood Christ as the new order of man?
C.A.C. Yes, it is Christ as the Branch that grew up; a beautiful tree has grown up in this world. Nothing was ever seen in this world, morally beautiful and perfect, except the Lord Jesus; and one must have Him before the heart as an
{73}
object, otherwise we do not see the import of it, that He was cut down, and cast into the water. Marah is @Romans 6. We identify ourselves in affection with the place Christ had in this world; we do it in the power of affection. Moses cried to the Lord, and the Lord showed him a tree. God brings Christ before us. If we are tasting the bitter water, God's way is to bring Christ before us, so that we are attracted to follow Him, to take up that new manner of life, seen perfectly in Christ. A beautiful life, perfectly suited to God, has been seen in this world. The great principle established is that nothing is to control the saint now but the will of God; a new manner of life is developed in the spirit of obedience. Death must come upon all our tastes and tendencies as natural men; there is no possibility of allowing them. We do not want to improve ourselves; we have to part company with ourselves, and until we see that is the character of life in the wilderness, we do not find the resources. The resources are to maintain us according to the will of God, not to help us to get through comfortably.
Rem. We have to take up this attitude definitely.
Rem. It is an immense favour to be recovered for God in the life of another Man.
C.A.C. Yes, to really have that blessed One before us, and to estimate everything according to Christ. We estimate things so much according to common sense, but we only have a right thought of anything when Christ is in view. Christ has died here, died to sin; the impassable gulf of death is between that blessed One and every movement of creature will; and if He is really the object of my heart there will be the same breach between me and creature will. The breach of death is between me and creature will. Now we are prepared for divine resources in the wilderness, so we come to Elim, that is the assembly, and then you get the manna and the springing well.
You have accepted for yourself the relation in which Christ stood to creature will. What has creature will done for me? I have had the narrowest escape from hell. Creature will, my
{74}
own will, put me within a hair's breadth of the bottomless pit. God's will has saved me, and it binds me to Him. Christ is the covenant which binds me to God. @Romans 6 is, that you take account of yourself as dead to sin, and alive to God.
Christ never had creature will; morally there was no point of contact between Him and the world. The great gulf of death is fixed between Christ and the sinful will of man. You say, 'Yes, Lord, I want death on my wretched, rebellious, unbroken will'. Then the water is sweet to you; you dread your will, and you want God's blessed will, and God says, 'Now I will support you, I will put all the resources of My kingdom at your disposal'. God would do anything for a creature who could say to Him, 'My God, I love Thee, I want Thy will, I want the support of all Thy resources'. What a blessed God we have to do with! What one desires is that we might see the magnificence of being here, enraptured with the will of God as seen in Christ; it is a will that ensures for us all the blessed fountain of good seen in God. My will is intolerable in the universe; it must be crushed. I was a bit of an integral part of the system of evil, but now the grace of God has come in to set me up in all the resources of that blessed Man. God says: 'I will give you His Spirit, who never did anything, or wanted anything, but My will. In the very place of responsibility, I will set you up with His resources, so that your responsible life shall not be Adam, but Christ'. "He takes away the first that he may establish the second" (@Hebrews 10: 9); first the natural, then the spiritual (@1 Corinthians 15: 46). Marah comes in as death on the natural, that is, natural in a moral sense. We come under control: "There he made for them a statute and an ordinance; and there he tested them. And he said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of Jehovah thy God". That is the new manner of life. The conditions are actually established now. It is not that the obedience is to be less exacting than of old. Now that we are not under law, we are not to be easy on ourselves, for we are set apart to the obedience of Christ. The character of our obedience is more exacting now that we are not under law, but under grace.
{75}
Ques. How would you explain the difference between being under law and being under grace?
C.A.C. We absolutely delight in God's conditions, under grace. Even the man in @Romans 7, who is not in full christian blessing, delights in the conditions; and the beginning of chapter 8 comes in as a way of liberty for this man. He does not complain of the conditions; he says, 'All I want is power to carry them out; I find no fault in the will of God, my trouble is that I cannot do it'. Then God says, 'I will set you up in divine resources, and give you the Spirit of My Son, so that you can do it'. You see the character of it all in Christ, a blessed Man in this world, who lived on resources that He had in God. We are not to be relieved of the conditions, but to get power to carry them out.
Then the manna comes in, the grace by which the Lord lived in this world. He touched every detail of human life. The manna touched everything, every blade of grass carried it, so the Lord touched every detail of life, in the power of heavenly grace, and He sends down supplies from heaven of the very grace that He lived on down here. It is what He lived on down here, the divine grace that sustained Him as Man down here. He is manna to us, He is the source of manna to us. He says, "My grace suffices thee"; that is manna.
Ques. Is that the thought of the husband?
C.A.C. Christ is your husband in @Romans 7; that is, we have One we can count on absolutely, but manna is that He supplies the very grace from heaven that sustained Him as the Man of faith down here. He was once in the very path that I am in, and He was sustained in that path by the Father's grace from heaven, grace was supplied for Him from heaven. He was a Man in divine favour, in blessed favour with God; because He always delighted to do the will of God, He was in full complacency and favour. He lived by the Father, that blessed Man lived by supplies from Heaven. If one may say so reverently, there never was a man so weak, "I was cast upon thee from the womb" (@Psalm 22: 10). He was wholly devoted to God, and now He ministers to us from
{76}
heaven the very same grace that sustained Him from heaven when He was down here.
Ques. We can say the Lord was never less than God, but would it be right to say He was never more than Man?
C.A.C. We can look at Him on our side as Man, but we must not say what He was *not*. That Person became Man, came into manhood. The God-Man is a misleading term, because it leads one to think of Him as not a real man. The Lord was a real Man, He was the Leader and Completer of faith. You cannot contemplate the two thoughts at the same time; that is, the Lord on the side of deity, and the Lord on the side of humanity; they are two distinct views of His Person, and it is impossible for us to take in the two thoughts at the same time.
Rem. We lose by trying to set one thought against the other.
C.A.C. The wonderful thing is that we should have His grace and His Spirit. We are in the path of that Man, and that leads to an entirely new manner of life. I feel ashamed to say anything about it, for I know so little about it; but that is christianity.
THE MANNA (1)
@Exodus 16: 16 - 36
Rem. Last week we were looking at the end of chapter 15 -- Marah -- and the commencement of chapter 16 -- the Manna -- the Lord's grace in answering the hunger and the thirst of His people. Hunger and thirst -- the two great needs of man -- met in grace.
C.A.C. It suggests that we are now to lead an entirely new manner of life for which Egypt's food is no good.
Rem. New food and different drink for "newness of life", "spiritual food and spiritual drink" (@1 Corinthians 10).
{77}
C.A.C. It is a fine thing when we begin to look at every circumstance and every need as an opportunity for a fresh expression of the blessed grace of God. That stops all murmurings.
Rem. The circumstances test us -- "to prove thee" (@Deuteronomy 8: 2).
C.A.C. There is a full supply for all our need but everything depends upon the state of our hearts. Have we hearts to value and make use of it? The fulness of supply tests us. Do we delight to move through wilderness circumstances in His way, sustained by what comes from heaven, so that nothing distracts us?
Ques. What is the root cause of murmurings?
C.A.C. Our natural thoughts have to be reversed. When this is not the case with us a murmuring spirit results. The flesh does not like to be put on a new line altogether. Flesh has no pleasure in a life perfectly set forth by Jesus. "In the evening flesh ... in the morning bread" (verses 6, 8, 12, 13). The murmuring day closes with the quails and the new day begins with the manna.
Ques. What do the quails set forth?
C.A.C. The death of Christ.
Ques. As in @John 6?
C.A.C. @John 6 is further on and leads right into the land. Here God says, as it were, "I will give you *flesh* tonight and *bread* in the morning". We have to eat "flesh" -- that is, death -- and finish up the murmuring day. Before we come to "bread" we must take up the thought of "flesh". "Flesh" terminates the murmuring day. "Flesh" suggests the death of Christ where murmuring flesh has met its just deserts at the hand of God. Christ to meet the murmuring and Christ to meet the need of the wilderness. *God* gives them the quails here, "When Jehovah gives you in the evening flesh to eat" (verse 8). It is different from @Numbers 11 where they are given "for their lust".
God has judged murmuring flesh in the death of Christ and there is bread from heaven in the morning. We need *new*
{78}
*tastes*; then we are ready for the manna. It is said of Moab in @Jeremiah 48: 11, "His scent is not changed". But in @Isaiah 11: 3, it is said of the Lord, "His delight (literally scent) will be in the fear of Jehovah".
The manna was "deposited before the Testimony" (verse 34). What is "deposited" is positively delightful to God. This is the first mention of the Testimony and the connection of the manna with it suggests God saying, as it were, 'I will supply food rich enough so that you can answer to My testimony as you go through the wilderness'.
The manna and the Sabbath go together. The Sabbath is first given to *man* here. "See, for Jehovah hath given you the Sabbath" (verse 29). In Genesis God keeps it for Himself (@Genesis 2: 2, 3). When you have eaten manna for a week (six days of exercise) you have your rest with God. "Tomorrow is the rest, the holy Sabbath, of Jehovah" (verse 23). The quails ought *not* to continue. We may see once for all that the day of murmuring has been brought to an end. We are to feed on the fact that Christ has borne the judgment of the murmurer.
The blood on the lintel, the way through the sea, the wood cast into the waters, "flesh", is all instruction in grace as to the death of Christ. It is one blessed chapter of grace after another to the end of chapter 18.
Ques. Is this pot of manna (verse 33) what is spoken of as "the hidden manna" in @Revelation 2: 17?
C.A.C. I am not sure that that refers to *this* pot of manna. With regard to *this* pot it says "that they may see" (verse 32), it is not hidden. The "hidden manna" suggests to me the wonderful blessedness of what has been hidden in regard of Christ here.
Ques. The thirty years?
C.A.C. Yes, that is right. For instance, in @Psalm 22: 9 He says, "Thou didst make me trust, upon my mother's breasts". Who ever saw that trust but God? Who saw Him drawing everything from God even as a Babe? Every part of that life was nourished out of heaven. And then at thirty years the Father could say, "Thou art my beloved Son, in
{79}
thee I *have found* my delight", @Luke 3: 22. All that "hidden manna" is for the overcomer, to be *spiritually* known now and fully enjoyed in the coming age.
The Lord was constantly drawing every needed support out of heaven from God. Every detail in His life was the product of grace and support out of heaven and *that is* the grace He ministers to you and to me. There is enough recorded of those thirty years to give us the character of them. For instance, Mary and Joseph fulfilled what was obligatory in Jerusalem and returned (@Luke 2: 42, 43) but the spiritual instincts of the Boy led Him to tarry behind in "the city of the great King", *absorbed* with what was of God.
There are two sides of the life of Jesus:
<ol>
<li>*The manna*, everything sustained from heaven every moment. He lived "by every word which goes out through God's mouth". All came down from heaven. </li>
<li>*The meat-offering*, what springs up here, "fine flour". The manna sets forth what heaven has for man. The meat-offering sets forth what man has for heaven. </li>
</ol>
The manna must be learned first, a life out of heaven, the product of bread from heaven. At His baptism the manna merges into the meat-offering, the oil is poured on it (@Leviticus 2: 1); "the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove upon him" (@Luke 3: 22). He was anointed there. Something is seen there that has sprung up *for* heaven.
Ques. What do you understand by "that they may see the bread that I gave you to eat in the wilderness" (verse 32)?
C.A.C. God's people as viewed in the land and finding the greatest delight in viewing the character of life seen in Christ in wilderness conditions. It is there to be seen spiritually.
Ques. Is the golden pot the assembly?
C.A.C. Yes, a divine vessel. All the preciousness of the manna as seen perfectly in Christ is to be treasured in our affections. The fineness of the grain is called attention to (verse 14). Every circumstance in His life, all His exercises, were vessels for the grace of heaven. There was no circumstance
{80}
so small in the life of the blessed Lord but what became the vessel for the grace of heaven to manifest itself. Why should we murmur at circumstances? Every circumstance becomes an asset, an occasion for the grace of heaven and the life of Jesus to be manifested. There is no other food for the redeemed.
Rem. I am afraid we loathe it sometimes.
C.A.C. It is very sad when it is so and only shows how the flesh comes into evidence in the people of God.
Ques. What is the Sabbath?
C.A.C. The thought of the Sabbath was in the mind of God. We get here the first introduction of it for man. "See, for Jehovah hath given you the Sabbath" (verse 29). The "flesh", the "bread", the "Sabbath" are all a question of divine gift.
Ques. For us what does it mean?
C.A.C. The Sabbath sets forth God's perfect rest in Christ outside the tests of the wilderness. They were to eat but not gather the manna on the sabbath (verse 25). There was to be perfect rest. Then (verse 29), "Abide every man in his place: let no man go from his place on the seventh day" suggests that each Israelite has his place in rest with God. Nothing on the Sabbath was to disturb his place with God. The Sabbath was at the end of six days of gathering.
Rem. The manna was within the reach of every Israelite.
C.A.C. All was grace; even if a man was not diligent, the administration of grace was so complete that each had his omer full (verses 16 - 19).
Ques. What about "the dew", verses 13, 14?
C.A.C. The dew suggests divine refreshing to prepare the way for the manna. "I will be as the dew unto Israel" (@Hosea 14: 5). God will thus prepare them to appreciate Christ. The dew falls on the spirits of His people to cause them to appreciate Christ as the manna. The dew falls silently and invisibly. It is a sovereign movement of God to prepare us to appreciate Christ. It is a reviving, a refreshing power on the spirit.
{81}
Rem. "He restoreth my soul".
C.A.C. We all know what it is. Sometimes when you open the Scriptures all seems dry; you want the dew. Another time the Scriptures come home with power. Why? You have had the dew. There is no manna without the dew. You must pray about the manna first. It is the activities of God sending the dew on our spirit. Look at the dry, barren state of Israel today and it will be so until the dew falls upon them. We all know the difference. Like Gideon's fleece, dry when all around is wet. I long for the dew.
<blockquote>'Each thought of Thee doth constant yield <br>Unchanging, fresh delight'. (`151:4)</blockquote>
Does it? It will if the dew is on you.
Rem. Nebuchadnezzar was "bathed with the dew of heaven" for seven years. The manna falls on prepared surfaces.
C.A.C. It is only appreciated by us as it falls on the dew.
Rem. The thought of food in Scripture is important.
C.A.C. It suggests the building up of a new constitution. Egypt's food, worldly literature, etc., build you up for Egypt. But that which is pleasurable to God, seen in Christ, is built up by feeding on the manna daily, for six days, so that we can enjoy our place in Sabbath rest with God. If we are really set to move on lines pleasurable to God, as seen in Christ, every test becomes an opportunity for the grace of heaven.
Rem. I suppose the question is raised also as to how we gather (verse 17).
C.A.C. There must be diligence. There is need of diligence. Peter is the great wilderness man and in his second epistle he tells us how the manna becomes available. It comes in on the line of gathering (@2 Peter 1: 3 - 11). "As his divine power has given to us all things which relate to life and godliness ... using therewith all diligence, in your faith have also virtue ...".
Rem. Lacking these things one is blind.
C.A.C. Practically we do not get the grace of heaven
{82}
until we are in circumstances where we need it. 'Egypt's food no more to eat'. There is a full supply of all we need to carry us right through to "the everlasting kingdom".
Ques. Would you say something as to "the Testimony" (verse 34)?
C.A.C. The Testimony first appears in connection with the manna. The Testimony really was the two tables. The suggestion in the manna being kept before it is that God had provided sufficient support for the Testimony to be set forth in His people. Before the Testimony is set forth, provision is made in the manna to enable the people of God to maintain the Testimony. The Sabbath gives you the thought of your place of enjoyment with God. Each has his place with God (verse 29). That is Godward. The Testimony is manward.
The saints are now the tables -- living tables (@2 Corinthians 3: 3). All that can be known of God by men is set forth in the saints. The manna enables us for it.
After faith (@2 Peter 1: 5) we need virtue, that is courage. There is a supply of courage for us, "As his divine power has given to us all things which relate to life and godliness". But we have to get it through exercise "using therewith all diligence". Again "use diligence" (verse 10). Each fresh period of exercise and history has its divine furnishing beforehand. We should be ready for opportunities. We miss them by not being ready for them.
The Testimony has its place in the wilderness. It is "The ark of testimony" and "The tabernacle of testimony" in the wilderness. "The Testimony" is in the wilderness where God is not known. We shall be in accord with the Testimony if feeding on the manna. The Testimony is Christ. Nothing forms part of the Testimony that is not Christ. What is fruit for God becomes Testimony in the world. The manna is said to be "very fine", the smallest circumstance affords an opportunity for the grace of heaven.
{83}
THE MANNA (2)
@Exodus 16: 22 - 36
Rem. We have noticed that the quails were given once but the manna daily.
C.A.C. "Between the two evenings ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God" (verse 12). It is the blessed way in which God is made known to us. He brings us, through His grace, to the end of the day of murmuring; through His grace it has no longer place with us. "Flesh" sets forth the wondrous fact that Christ has come in flesh to bear the judgment of what we were as in flesh, in murmuring flesh. He came in holy flesh. The day marked by incessant murmurings ends. None of us are supposed to be going on with it. Bread from heaven does not sustain a life of murmuring. The death of Christ is the end of the murmurer. We are always inclined to murmur naturally. Anything that does not fit in with our natural tastes causes us to murmur and we are inclined to blame God for it. We first murmur and then complain. "Murmurers, complainers" (@Jude 16) is the order. First there is the inward murmuring and then the complaining. That is not the new manner of life. That day ends by our apprehending the fact that Christ has borne the judgment of the murmurer -- the flesh as discovered in the people of God, not as in an unconverted man. God gives us "flesh". "When Jehovah gives you in the evening flesh to eat" (verse 8). There is first the ending of that day. The new day is begun eating the new bread out of heaven. What is that? A new manner of life characterised by entire dependence, seen here in Jesus. Everything comes down from heaven. "I will rain bread from heaven for you" (verse 4). The manna is what is perfectly set forth in the Lord Jesus -- entire dependence and absolute obedience. "Man doth not live by bread alone, but by everything that goeth out of the mouth of Jehovah doth man live"
{84}
(@Deuteronomy 8: 3) is said in reference to the manna. It gives us the spiritual idea of the manna. Learn to live by what goes out of God's mouth: our spirits live and we live by that. The Lord actually lived by it. He would not make the stone into bread. He lived by every word that proceeded out of God's mouth. That would bring about a heavenly character of life in the wilderness.
Rem. No murmuring or complaining.
C.A.C. "The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places: yea, I have a goodly heritage. Jehovah is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot" (@Psalm 16: 6,5).
Ques. Does @John 6 surpass the manna?
C.A.C. "The bread of God" in @John 6 is contrasted with the manna. Manna suffices to sustain us for life here, wilderness life, but not for over Jordan. In @John 6 the food "abides unto life eternal"; it carries us into a spiritual and eternal region where there are no necessities except the needs of affections that crave for God and for Christ.
Ques. Is the manna for the Christian alone, or is it for all men?
C.A.C. It is limited to those who have been redeemed -- to His own people, not the Egyptians. They did not appreciate the manna but it was the divine thought for them.
God has brought us out of Egypt. The death of Christ is between us and Egypt. God is our salvation and we are brought to the abode of His holiness (chapter 15: 2, 13).
Rem. The Red Sea is deliverance from Egypt, from the world.
C.A.C. "By faith they passed through the Red sea".
Moses kept the passover for all Israel (@Hebrews 11: 28, 29). Our Moses has kept the passover for us. "For also our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed" (@1 Corinthians 5: 7). He has undertaken the whole business. But when it comes to a question of the world *we* have to move: "Speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward" (@Exodus 14: 15). @Romans 5 answers to "Stand still", @Romans 6 to "Go forward". We are outside
{85}
the world by redemption, on new ground and in a new kind of life, "newness of life", which is only sustained by what comes from heaven as typified in the manna. We are absolutely dependent upon it.
Going forward involves being true to our baptism. "Ye have obeyed from the heart the form of teaching into which ye were instructed" (@Romans 6: 17). God has been pleased to put the teaching (the truth) into a tangible form for us. We are put under water. To have "obeyed from the heart" is a wonderful moment for the Christian. He moves forward then to take the ground of a man outside this world altogether according to the springs of his being, living in resurrection power, "newness of life". A Christian's life is a miracle. And how is it kept up? By food; the constitution is built up and it is manna that does it.
Rem. We see that in the eunuch in @Acts 8: after his baptism it says of him that "he went on his way rejoicing". It was "newness of life" for him.
C.A.C. It is the Christian's desire to walk in a manner of life in perfect contrast to the natural man. It is the glory of a natural man to do his own will. When you murmur it is that something crosses your own will (that is the secret of murmuring and complaining). God intended it to be so. God reminds you that as a Christian you must live on an entirely different principle. You must start to live this miraculous life, the life of a Christian. It is no use to say, 'We are poor, weak things'.
Rem. "We do know that all things work together for good to those who love God" (@Romans 8: 28).
C.A.C. Such are persons who have been having the manna. Why should the blessed God who loves us permit these things? He says, as it were, 'It is an opportunity for you to learn what I have provided for you in Christ'. We have often to be reminded of things we know. That is what admonition is, a putting in mind of what you really know.
After the Red Sea and the song they went three days in the wilderness and found no water; there was nothing to minister
{86}
to them. "And they came to Marah, and could not drink the waters of Marah, for they were bitter". It was not according to their natural tastes and desires. We have to honestly face it and either have what is pleasing to the flesh, or accept nothing but suffering in the flesh. "Christ, then, having suffered for us in the flesh, do ye also arm yourselves with the same mind: for he that has suffered in the flesh has done with sin" (@1 Peter 4: 1). If I gratify myself I sin, if I suffer I cease from sin. It is the bringing in of Christ that sweetens things. If Christ suffered in the flesh, that is the path for me. "There he made for them a statute and an ordinance" (chapter 15: 25). You are to suffer in the flesh -- it is an unchangeable principle -- and learn to live by manna. It is either the flesh or Christ for each one of us. There are no complications about it. We have to get sustainment and support from heaven, not from any natural source: something straight from heaven to enable you to turn the trial into a triumph; that is what the manna is for. Every need is met by grace out of heaven. The smallest thing in the precious, holy life of our blessed Lord was out of heaven, "fine, ... fine as hoar-frost" (verse 14). In the life of the Lord Jesus each circumstance of the wilderness, each grain of sand, has its beautiful bit of manna on it. Nothing ever overcame Him. Could any circumstance be too much for the grace of heaven? Every circumstance or testing or trial is a vessel to hold the grace of heaven.
It is beautiful to see the object that God has in view in the connection between the manna and the sabbath. "See, for Jehovah hath given you the Sabbath". "The rest, the holy Sabbath, of Jehovah" (verses 29, 23). It is the end of six days of living on the manna, gathering it and living on it. On the seventh day there was to be no gathering, but a living on it. It is a day of no wilderness exercise, no more toil or labour, but rest. A day in which there is nothing to interfere with our enjoyment of Christ with God. The life God would have us to live in the wilderness is such that there would be nothing to interfere with our enjoying that sabbath -- rest with Himself.
{87}
Ques. Would that be true as regards the Lord's Day?
C.A.C. If really sustained by manna we would be undistracted when we come together.
Rem. The manna followed the dew (verses 13, 14).
C.A.C. It is a lovely touch. The dew suggests something that precedes the manna. We need to be divinely refreshed in our spirits before we can appreciate the manna. First dew, then manna. We have all received some dew at some time or other. I like to wake up first thing in the morning and my first thought be of the Lord. That is dew, the spirit is refreshed.
Do you ever feel dry? Dew is the sovereign movement of God on our spirits. God says, "I will be as the dew unto Israel". Israel has been dry for three thousand years but God will refresh their affections and they will then say, "This is our God". The dew is a divine refreshing: it falls silently and well-nigh invisibly: there is no noise but it comes down and refreshes everything. It is a blessed movement of God on His people.
The manna was to be "gathered", "cooked", "baked" (verse 23). It all speaks of exercise that the full value of the manna may be realised. The cooking here suggests the exercise necessary to get the full value of it, not as in @Numbers 11 where it was done to make it palatable. There the *spiritual* character of the manna is pointed out, when they despised it, it was "as the taste of oil-cakes" (verse 8); that is the spiritual character of it. It is a dreadful thing to despise what is so entirely spiritual. *Here* (@Exodus 16) it is the sweetness of it that is commented upon: "And the taste of it was like cake with honey" (verse 31). We can get the beautiful grace out of heaven to meet everything so as to be able to look at things as Christ looked at them and to walk as He walked. I do not know any other suitable walk for the Christian.
Ques. What is the "pot of manna" (verses 32, 33)?
C.A.C. It is very beautiful as showing that the manna is never to be forgotten or lost sight of. There may come a time when we do not need it, when we touch the scene of divine purpose all brought to fruition in a risen and glorified Christ.
{88}
At that point we do not need the manna as food, but for contemplation. It is the eternal theme of contemplation in heaven -- the wonderful life of the Lord Jesus in wilderness circumstances, and the grace He ministered from heaven to enable His people to walk like Him in wilderness circumstances. The wonderful preciousness of a dependent and obedient life in the presence of testing and opposition seen perfectly in the Lord Jesus from infancy to the end of His pathway here is all treasured in the golden pot. Much was never seen by the eyes of men. "Thou didst make me trust, upon my mother's breasts" (@Psalm 22: 9). His mother never saw it. It is part of the hidden manna. It is all treasured in the golden pot to be the theme of adoration for ever. It was "deposited before the Testimony" (verse 34), suggesting that God is going to secure a kind of life in man in perfect correspondence with His testimony -- secured in Christ. There was never any misrepresentation of God's testimony in Christ. We shall be in keeping with the testimony if we live on the manna. We shall be preserved in accord with God's testimony, a most important thing today. That testimony takes assembly character at the present time, not individual. The assembly is in the wilderness and is God's testimony in the wilderness. Everything inconsistent with the testimony is not marked by dependence and obedience but by man's own resources. All that is in dependence and obedience constitutes the testimony. All else is inconsistent with the manna or the Sabbath, be it individual or assembly conditions.
{89}
NOTES OF A READING
@Exodus 17: 1 - 16
Rem. Last week we saw how the hunger was met (chapter 16), this week it is the thirst.
C.A.C. Do you not think it is good to see that the people come into circumstances of testing and discipline by divine leading? That is, not in consequence of their own missing their way; they "journeyed ..., according to their journeys, at the command of Jehovah" (verse 1).
Rem. There is a great deal of difference between the two.
C.A.C. Quite so, and it intimates to us that it is often God's way to put us into positions of difficulty. Sometimes the question is raised with us as to whether we have been moving right, but sometimes there is a divine reason why we should come into testing. It was certainly so in the case of the blessed Lord. "But Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness forty days, tempted of the devil" (@Luke 4: 1). And in @Mark 1: 12, "And immediately the Spirit drives Him out into the wilderness". It seems there that the Spirit of God was urgent that He should be tested in the fullest possible way. In His case it only brought out the perfection that was there. If we come into testing by the leading of God it is that we might learn the divine resources that are available for us. That is the end in view. We do not learn them till we feel the need of them. This exercise belongs to the second month (chapter 16: 1).
Ques. What do you mean by that?
C.A.C. There are months in the spiritual year. Certain exercises pertain to different months. The passover, the Red Sea, Marah and Elim belong to the first month. The manna and the water from the rock belong to the second month.
It says of the Lord as the Tree of life, "Producing twelve
{90}
fruits, in each month yielding its fruit" (@Revelation 22: 2). That intimates the spiritual year and a special knowledge of Christ belonging to each month. Each month enables us to bring more to God in the way of praise and worship as we increase in the knowledge of Himself. There is a special offering on every day of the new moon. Each month of spiritual history gives enlargement to serve God with praise. It is important to take account of what month of the year we are in.
Ques. Do "months" belong to the wilderness?
C.A.C. They have a place in the land and also in the world to come as we see in @Revelation 22: 2. There is a spiritual year in the holy city.
Ques. What do you understand by "the second month"?
C.A.C. The exercises of the manna and the water from the rock belong to the second month. In the first month there is a good deal of exercise relating to coming out of Egypt -- the passover, the Red Sea, Marah and Elim.
Ques. Is it the relief side?
C.A.C. We come out of the life of Egypt
<ol>
<li>sheltered by the blood,</li>
<li>fed on the Lamb roast with fire, </li>
<li>as passed through the Red Sea, learning God as strength, song and salvation, and</li>
<li>at Marah take up the kind of life where nothing ministers to our old tastes, drink bitter water and have it made sweet for us. </li>
</ol>
It takes some believers a long time to get out of Egypt but there is no reason for this on the divine side.
Ques. Is all this true for us on the divine side?
C.A.C. I think we learn the resources that are available in grace in these chapters particularly; therefore all is seen to be purely on God's side. There is nothing to commend the people; they tempt God and contend with Moses. Their character is revealed in the names Temptation (Massah) and Contention (Meribah). God gives the Spirit entirely from His own side in pure grace. It is the first distinct type of the gift of the Spirit.
{91}
Ques. Does it correspond with @Romans 5?
C.A.C. It is not typical of the moment when the believer receives the Spirit but when he recognises the Spirit. It is not possible to be in the experience answering to the redemption song (@Exodus 15) without having the Spirit. Elim suggests spiritual refreshment and shelter. In the song they are brought "unto the abode of thy holiness" (verse 13) which supposes the gift of the Spirit.
In Romans you get no particular point as to when the believer gets the Spirit. He is not definitely recognised until @Romans 5. There is a moment when the Spirit is recognised as being present. The believer comes consciously to the recognition of the Spirit (@Exodus 17) -- a very important moment in the soul's history.
Rem. I suppose there has been no conflict with the flesh before.
C.A.C. No conflict with Amalek. The moment something is brought about in the people of God definitely suggesting the Spirit, the enemy's hostility breaks out; it is against what is of the Spirit of God. God raises the question of the Spirit definitely for every soul. All of us who have been converted know that God has raised that question with us. He first presents Christ to us, "delivered for our offences ... raised for our justification ... . Therefore ... we have peace towards God through our Lord Jesus Christ" (@Romans 4: 25; @Romans 5: 1). We know how we stand in righteousness with God "through our Lord Jesus Christ" -- that is the first month.
In the second month the question of the Spirit is raised. God gives the Spirit as soon as He can. He raises the question of the Spirit as soon as the soul is settled in divine peace. It is not raised before @Romans 5: 1. All that is through the blessed work of Christ, not by the Spirit, but by faith. As soon as the soul knows that, God raises the question of the Spirit -- at an early stage of the soul's history, at the second month.
Ques. What is Horeb? (verse 6).
C.A.C. Horeb is the place of the covenant, typical of
{92}
where God is known in love. The great expression of the love of God to believers is that He gives the Spirit. It is a question of how we think of the Lord Jesus Christ. How do I think of the Lord Jesus Christ? In the first month as the One who "bore our sins" -- all the judgment due to us -- and is "raised again for our justification". He is with God in perfect suitability to that resurrection world into which He has entered. The believer is as clear as Christ is. *He is* Himself our righteousness. We have to learn now to accept suffering here, i.e. reproach. Marah is reproach -- bitter water. We ought to feel reproach. The Lord could say, "Reproach hath broken my heart". He came not to please Himself but to bear the reproach of God. Christ came here not to have a good time. When we see Christ's path it makes reproach sweet; it becomes a path of companionship with Christ. That is the first month.
Rem. It is said of Moses in @Hebrews 11, "Esteeming the reproach of the Christ".
C.A.C. Moses faced it. You learn to accept what is naturally most distasteful to you, but when you see it to be the path of your Saviour and Lord, then it is sweet.
"Christ, then, having suffered for us in the flesh, do ye also arm yourselves with the same mind" (@1 Peter 4: 1). Your mind is to suffer in flesh but to be here for God's will. It cost Christ everything that a heart could suffer in relation to God.
Ques. Do we get an example of such a one in @John 9?
C.A.C. He goes through to the knowledge of the Son of God. And the Son of God is He who baptises with the Holy Spirit.
In the second month it is Christ in connection with the Spirit. We want to think of the Spirit in relation to the Person who gives the Spirit, not so much in relation to the one who receives the Spirit. The Lord Jesus is introduced to us at the commencement of each gospel as the One who would "baptise with the Holy Spirit". It is the first presentation of Him but we do not come to it till the second month.
{93}
Ques. What is Gilgal?
C.A.C. Gilgal is circumcision (@Joshua 5). "Jehovah said to Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you" (verse 9). If we learn it and come to it in mind, the last vestige of the reproach of Egypt is rolled away.
Ques. Do you connect "and to finish his work" (@John 4: 34) with the gift of the Holy Spirit?
C.A.C. We begin to think of the death of Christ from a new point of view. God's object, in His grace and love, was to give us His Spirit. In the death of Christ God has enabled Himself to give the Spirit to those who before were sinful creatures. On the divine side God can now give the Spirit on account of the death of Christ. Water flowed from the rock in answer to the smiting. The rod had been previously stretched over the river (verse 5), typical of the life of Egypt; judgment had come on it.
In the death of Christ-the smiting-we see
<ol>
<li>the manifested judgment of God on the whole life of this world. "One died for all, then all have died" (@2 Corinthians 5: 14). </li>
<li>God's object in grace to give the Spirit to men. </li>
</ol>
In the death of Christ all the rebellion, etc., of the flesh was judged -- smitten in the death of Christ -- that God might give the Spirit so that we may move through the wilderness in vigour of soul in spite of the dryness around.
Ques. Is this seen in @John 7: 37 - 39?
C.A.C. The Lord presents Himself very much in John as the One who gives the Spirit. @John 4: 10, 14, "If thou knewest the gift of God ...", and @John 7: 37 - 39, "Let him come to me ...". There is an immense thought of plenitude connected with the Spirit as a divine Person -- "rivers", "a fountain springing up", "baptises with the Spirit" -- not only a little drop to drink, but enough to immerse us in "the river of God which is full of water".
Rem. "Waters to swim in" (@Ezekiel 37:5).
C.A.C. And @Titus 3: 5, 6, "Renewal of the Holy Spirit, which He poured out on us richly". What a plenitude there
{94}
is! "Be filled with the Spirit" (@Ephesians 5: 8). There is enough and more than enough to fill you, to fill every corner of your being.
Rem. @John 3 precedes @John 4.
C.A.C. It is the end of the wilderness, beyond @Exodus 17, but shows how the thought of the Spirit is before the mind of God. He would bring it before our minds. God's intent was to give His Spirit. Christ died that God might be clear to give me the Spirit. It is Christ's glory to give the Spirit. It is the greatest thing that my Saviour in glory has done for me.
Ques. Is it the giving of God?
C.A.C. What is in the heart of God.
We all know what it is to have had our expectations disappointed and sometimes even to be on the line of unbelief. "Is Jehovah among us, or not?" 'Am I really converted, or not?' 'Have I got a definite link with God with such unsatisfactory experiences?' In that way God makes room with us for the recognition of the Spirit. "Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock on Horeb: and thou shalt strike the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink" (verse 6). God's great delight is to set us up in the Spirit. But when the Spirit has been recognised it is very important that we do not return to the flesh. We have now to move with the Spirit. Rebecca "rode upon the camels, and followed the man" (@Genesis 24: 61). "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God" (@Ephesians 4: 30). "Walk ... according to Spirit" (@Romans 8: 4).
Every one who has believed has some of the good of the Spirit. The "blessedness" of @Romans 4: 6 - 8 is there by the Spirit. God gives the Spirit as soon as He can; there is no delay on His part. Take Scripture. See @Acts 2: 38: "Repent, and be baptised, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit". He puts it very simply. Again, (@Acts 10 and 11) baptism was not necessary prior to the reception of the Holy
{95}
Spirit. Peter says, "As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them". And what was he saying? "To him all the prophets bear witness that every one that believes on him will receive through his name remission of sins". 'I was just saying that (says Peter) and the Holy Spirit fell on them all'.
Ques. Do you not get the same word in @Luke 15, "His father fell upon his neck"?
C.A.C. In the parable, that is the gift of the Spirit, the father falling on his neck. But when did he do it? When the prodigal had said, "Father, I have sinned", when he was in that state of mind. There was no running on the part of the prodigal, but of the father. There was self-judgment with the prodigal and running on the part of the father. That is the blessed God that we know. The kiss put on the repentant son -- the caressing embrace -- God delights to do it. What was pent up in his heart all those years? Those kisses -- just as the best robe was retained. God delights to give the Spirit. The devil tells believers sometimes that they have not or cannot have the Spirit; it is all a mistake.
Rem. "How much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him" (@Luke 11: 13). And, as you have said, if we are filled with the Spirit the house is not unoccupied (verse 26).
C.A.C. It is a great source of strength to us to know that we have received the Spirit. He is said to be given (1) to those who believe, (2) to those who obey, (3) to those who love, and (4) to those who repent. It is put in many different ways, not cut and dried.
The Spirit gives assurance in the heart of the love of God as revealed in the death of Christ -- the death of Christ as the great evidence of the love of God. He thus pours out the love of God into my heart. We have a present sense by the Spirit of the love of God. Nothing that happens in the wilderness affects it. There is nothing so satisfying as the love of God.
Rem. Jehovah says, "I will stand there" -- the death of Christ. Wonderful fulness!
{96}
C.A.C. That is how God would present Himself to us in this wonderful type. Satan harasses us as to our condition and worthiness. The gift of the Spirit is the most stupendous thing conceivable -- the fruit of that stupendous work that the Lord Jesus accomplished on the cross. God's appreciation of that is so great that He is free to give the Spirit to every repentant and believing sinner.
Rem. "That the people may drink" (verse 6) -- not one is excluded.
C.A.C. The water is given in spite of what we are. 'Temptation' and 'Contention' -- there was no merit or reason in the people why they should have the water.
Ques. Would you say something as to "covered him with kisses"?
C.A.C. It expresses the great plenitude there is in the Spirit. Very great things are to be expected. It is a great thing to recognise the Spirit. I have used this illustration before now. Say a man has a farm in South Africa. Every now and then he picks up little nuggets of gold on it -- certain joy and pleasure in believing, the sense of forgiveness, etc., all the gain of the Spirit. But tell the farmer, 'Your whole farm has a gold reef under it'. Would it not awaken wondrous anticipations, etc? Our anticipation of things in our christian life begins to be coloured by the stupendous fact that one has the Spirit, to be used and enjoyed, just as the mine has to be worked out.
{97}
CHRIST THE ROCK
@2 Samuel 22: 1 - 3; @Psalm 71: 3; @Psalm 27: 4, 5; @Exodus 17: 6; @Isaiah 32: 2; @Psalm 81: 16
It is evident that solemn times are at hand both for the world and for the church of God. There is restless activity in both the political and the religious worlds. We are in the rapids of time and as the stream rushes on things shift and change on every hand. Old principles and creeds are being discarded, and the truth of God surrendered by one section of Christendom after another. We read that in the last days "difficult times" should come, and we see the features of these times all around us. But amid the storm there is a haven where our souls may come to anchor; in the midst of the conflict there is a strong tower into which we may run and be safe; amidst all the changes there is One who is "the same yesterday, and today, and for ever" -- One who remains in eternal stability as a *Rock*.
A rock is the standing type of what is secure and steadfast. It stands firm in sunshine and shade, in storm or calm. When the dead leaves and brushwood are swept away by the torrent the rock remains. Hence the rock has a prominent place among the symbols of Scripture and many times the Lord is spoken of as a Rock. I want to bring a few of these passages before you.
@2 Samuel 22: 1 - 3, this is what I call *the Saving Rock* (cf. verse 47). David multiplies figures to express his appreciation of the Person he is speaking of. He searches his mind for figures in which to set forth the excellence of that blessed One. Listen to this sevenfold description -- "my Fortress, my Deliverer, my Shield, the Horn of my salvation, my High Tower, my Refuge, my Saviour". Let me ask, Has your heart ever found itself so full of Christ that you were at a loss how to speak sufficiently of Him? Do you know this Person? All these titles which David's faith and love lavished upon Him
{98}
are comprehended in the last -- "My Saviour". "David spoke to Jehovah the words of this song in the day that Jehovah had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul". David had a perfect deliverance; in type a full salvation. The little word 'all' makes us think of the precious gospel message that "by him all that believe are justified from *all* things". Saul, too, a type of Satan, had lost his victim, as we are delivered from the power of darkness. We, like David, have a saving Rock, and we wreathe His brow with the tribute of our gratitude and love as we sing,
<blockquote>'Jesus! our Saviour, Shepherd, Friend, <br>Thou Prophet, Priest and King, <br>Our Lord, our Life, our Way, our End, <br>Accept the praise we bring'. (`54:4)</blockquote>
I trust that every soul here knows Him and loves Him in His blessed character of Saviour!
@Psalm 71: 3; @Psalm 27: 4, 5. I call this *the Shielding Rock*. In both these psalms enemies are mentioned; there is conflict and danger. We need ever to remember that we are passing through an enemy's land. A host *does* encamp against us, and war *does* rise up against us; that is, *if we are true to Christ*. The worldly professor and the half-hearted believer may go on in peace, because they have surrendered to the world or at any rate have made a truce with the foe, but if the disciple is true to his Lord, the world will not be guilty of the inconsistency of hating the Master and loving the servant. There is an old-standing and deadly enmity between the world and our Lord, and if we would be preserved from confusion and defeat we must keep under cover of the Shielding Rock.
Notice the words, "Whereunto I may continually resort" in @Psalm 71 and "All the days of my life" in @Psalm 27. It is not to be occasionally but "continually", for you never know a moment beforehand *when* the attack is coming, or *from what direction*; not on Lord's Days only but "*all* the days of my life". We are called to 'abide' in Him. What wondrous
{99}
grace that we should be preserved and shielded by that which most gladdens our hearts! Fortresses are not always the most comfortable places, and on the field of battle the place of safety is not always in itself an agreeable spot. But look at this place in @Psalm 27: 4 - 5. Could any place be more attractive to the heart of a Christian? And it is the only safe place. We not only *may* continually resort to this sweet retreat, but we *must* be there to escape the onslaughts and fiery darts of the enemy.
Look at @Psalm 31: 19, 20. Here are two things in reference to which we specially need our Lord as a Shielding Rock: "The pride of man" and "The strife of tongues". The pride of man is a fearful enemy and more to be dreaded *in our own hearts* than anywhere else. It is this that makes Christians want to get on in the world where Christ died, so that for the sake of worldly gain they will sacrifice meetings, christian fellowship, private communion and meditation and the interests of Christ. It is sometimes painful to discover, after all we have said and sung about being crucified and dead, and about sacrificing the vain things that charm us most, how much our hearts are influenced by the opinions of men, and how we shrink from being "fools for Christ's sake". Then again, if through grace we devote ourselves in any little measure to the work of the Lord, how soon we become in danger of another kind of "the pride of man"! Beloved brethren, we need shielding from this and there is One who can hide us from it in the secret of His presence. Mark! it is in the secret of His presence. Anything that gives us prominence before men or our brethren has a tendency to nourish "the pride of man", and if our public life is not balanced by our private life we shall fall into the snare.
It is of infinite importance that the inner life of our souls should be developed. Icebergs of very great magnitude and splendour are often seen floating in the ocean, but it is a fact that for every ton of ice that appears above water there are eight tons under water, and it is the enormous unseen mass that balances and ballasts that which is visible. The secret life
{100}
of the soul must be in excess of the public life or we shall become top-heavy and there will be spiritual disaster. May the Lord give us to know more of "the secret of His presence"! There, alone with Him, the pride of man withers and dies. There we learn our nothingness; we see imperfections in ourselves that others cannot see, and we discover that the spring of everything is *grace*. May the Lord draw us continually to His presence to know the blessedness of divine love, and to be so filled with it that there shall be no room in our hearts for "the pride of man".
Then our Rock shields us from "the strife of tongues", and never was there a day when saints have needed Him more in this character than now. Christendom is a vast Babel of contending voices, and this is not only true in the outer circle of profession, but amongst those who are true children of God. What is the simple soul to do? When questions arise and Christians differ in judgment, and the strife of tongues begins, let the simple believer betake himself to the Shielding Rock, and he will prove what it is to be "kept secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues". While others are discussing and disputing he will be enjoying the company and love of Christ.
@Isaiah 32: 2. This is *the Shadowing Rock*. The beautiful and striking figure here employed by the Holy Spirit is one of a group of three which respectively set forth the Lord Jesus as a Hiding Place, a River and a Shadowing Rock. Imagine a poor traveller crossing a burning desert. There has been no attractive scenery to occupy his mind; it has been "a weary land". The fierce rays of the sun have been beating down upon him, and his feet are sore with the roughness of the way. He longs for rest, but it is impossible to lie down on the ground which is so hot that the naked feet cannot bear contact with it. He sighs for a tree as a shade but there is no such thing within sight, and the weary limbs must move onward and the throbbing brain must still endure the scorching heat. But at last an object rises in distant view. The traveller's step
{101}
quickens, and his hopes revive. He draws nearer, and behold, it is a great rock. He hastens to it, and unloosing sandal and girdle he casts himself down in its cool and blessed shade. Such is the figure used by the prophet when he speaks of our Lord as "the shadow of a great rock in a weary land".
It needs no great depth of spiritual understanding to find the whereabouts of the "weary land". If we were to speak as natural men we should not think of calling the world a weary land. To the unconverted this world is not a wilderness -- it is an attractive Sodom, a rich Egypt, or a splendid Babylon. But to the child of God this world is a wilderness. It contains nothing to minister to the divine nature. To the saint -- the one born of God -- the world is a "weary land".
The sun was made to rule the day (@Genesis 1) and so the sun is in Scripture a type of the influence of the day. So long as we are in the world we shall be subject to many influences that test and try us, and tend to spiritual exhaustion. There is a time coming of which it is written, "They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat" (@Revelation 7: 16). But while we are here the sun does light on us, and oftentimes we feel the heat of the day. Most of us have to earn our bread by some form of manual or mental labour, and the minds of many have necessarily to be much engaged with what we are doing here. Then, again, many have to mix with worldly men and women from morning to night, and however much you desire to be separate you cannot always shut your ears to what is said, or your eyes to what is done, and it all has a certain influence upon you which tends to weaken you spiritually.
Then further, the action of the sun's rays is used by the Lord in the parable of the sower as a figure of persecution. Many dear saints are much exposed to the scorching sun of persecution. Perhaps some of us have not so much of this as we should have if we were more faithful; but according to the measure of our fidelity we all know something of it. A brother told me the other day that a work-fellow in the
{102}
forge had struck him a blow on the head with a hammer that might have killed him, for no reason but that he would not run to the same excess or riot as the ungodly around him.
How sweet it is, in view of all this, to have a Shadowing Rock under which we can lie down, and find the repose which our tried and weary spirits need. One could say, "I sat down under his shadow *with great delight*". Beloved Christian, do you not know what it is to grow so weary of men and things that your spirit faints for the company of Christ, and you know no repose and no joy until you get under His shadow? We all know what physical exhaustion is and how delightful it is after toil to throw the weary body down in comfort and rest. Now the spirit gets weary as well as the body, and if you do not give your spirit rest you will get spiritually worn out; your soul's health will break down. I think I have seen many cases of spiritual sunstroke -- believers who have exposed themselves to the influence of present things until they are completely paralysed for Christ. Get into the shade, my brother. It is dangerous to be under the beams of the sun too long. And when you get into the shadow of the great Rock do not be in a hurry to depart. Sit down there; linger in the blessed spot until your whole soul is filled with tranquillity and joy.
In @Exodus 17: 6 we read of *the Smitten Rock*. There could be no blessing of any kind for us apart from the death of Christ. It was necessary that He should take up all our liabilities, and that He should come under all that was due to us, in order to deliver us from death and judgment and the lake of fire. But this aspect of the death of Christ -- deeply important and blessed as it is -- is not presented to us in @Exodus 17. The smiting of the rock is a figure of that precious death as opening up eternal springs of refreshments for our souls. Pitiable, indeed, would be the case of the believer if he had no divine refreshment to invigorate and sustain his spirit in the wilderness. He has turned his back on Egypt's resources, and Canaan's riches are not yet *actually possessed*.
{103}
Then from whence is he refreshed in the wilderness? The smitten rock supplies the answer.
The death of Christ has not only *relieved us*, but it has *revealed* God. The everlasting springs of the divine nature have flowed out thereby in blessing to man. "God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us" (@Romans 5: 8). "In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins" (@1 John 4: 9, 10). "Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us" (@1 John 3: 16).
It is the *love of God* flowing out to us through the death of Christ that refreshes and invigorates our hearts in the wilderness, and gives us the consciousness that God is for us. The death of Christ has not only revealed the love of God, but it has so settled every question connected with our responsibility as children of Adam that we are on an entirely new ground with God. God has taken us up on the ground of accomplished redemption, and on that ground we receive the Holy Spirit. In the death of Christ sins have been removed, sin judged and God glorified about every question that sin had raised. And now "the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us" (@Romans 5: 5). That blessed love thus becomes the refreshment of our hearts as we pass through "a dry and thirsty land, where no water is" (@Psalm 63: 1).
Finally Christ is *the Satisfying Rock*. "With honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee" (@Psalm 81: 16). There are hidden stores of sweetness and blessing in the Son of God, out of which God delights to minister satisfaction to His saints. Do not think that because you have believed on His blessed name, and have tasted something of the joy of salvation, you have got everything. Nay, what you have received is only a few drops out of a boundless ocean. By the grace of
{104}
God you have *begun* to know Christ. Now *go on* to know Him. The apostle Paul, after many years of christian growth and devoted service, was still longing "that I may know him" (@Philippians 3: 10). Alas! there are many who seem as though they would like to have Christ for *salvation* and the world for *satisfaction*. Such are doomed to double dissatisfaction, and they deserve to be of all men most miserable.
In @Psalm 81 we see that God has taken up His people in infinite grace. He had removed their shoulder from the burden, and delivered their hands from the pots; they called in trouble and He delivered them, and He told them to open their mouth wide and He would fill it. But His people would not hearken to His voice, and Israel would none of Him; so He gave them up to their own hearts lust, and they walked in their own counsels. Is there any satisfaction in such a path? No. If we do our own will we never gain happiness thereby, but the thing we have desired becomes a scourge to us. Satisfaction, as we see in this psalm, is closely connected with obedience. "Oh, that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways! ... with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee". When any little bit of worldly gratification attracts your heart, remember that God has something infinitely better, and if you hearken to Him and walk in His ways he will feed you with the finest of the wheat, and satisfy you with honey out of the Rock.
The true spring of obedience is devotedness. It is as we cleave with purpose of heart to the Lord that we find our joy in walking in His ways. In the path of holy obedience the Spirit is not grieved, and He is thus free to carry on His delightful work of ministering *Christ* to our hearts. May each one of us be found ever walking in such a way that there may be no hindrance to our being fed with the finest of the wheat, and satisfied with the honey out of the Rock.
{105}
THE LORD FOR GOD'S PLEASURE
@Psalm 40: 5 - 8; @Isaiah 50: 4 - 7; @Exodus 21: 1 - 6
C.A.C. I would suggest for our consideration scriptures which bring the Lord before us as the One who is the pleasure of God and who is able to put us in accord with that pleasure as suggested by our brother's prayer.
In suggesting these scriptures my desire is that the Lord Himself may be before us; that we may get an enlarged spiritual apprehension of Him. That will profoundly affect us -- I do not know that anything else will -- and thus divine instruction and worship will be brought about, for which we have prayed.
Ques. Is there moral order in the scriptures presented?
C.A.C. In @Psalm 40 the Lord Himself is taking up conditions in which He could give effect to the pleasure of God for eternity, resulting in there being *worshippers*. @Psalm 40 is the complete result.
@Isaiah 50 is the place He took in relation to service and suffering given *in detail*. Every detail of service is dwelt on and He becomes the Object of adoring delight to those capable of appreciating it. It is the infinite perfection in detail of His life here.
@Exodus 21 is His devoted service to God and the saints in relation to that which is *infinite*, securing for ever the delight of God. It is outside limitations -- "for ever". The capability to secure it all lies in Christ.
Ques. Why so in @Exodus 21?
C.A.C. Because it is "for ever". The Lord entered into conditions of service which were finite, that is "six years". He was Jehovah's Servant for that period. As He says, "The things concerning me have an end" (@Luke 22: 37), and "I have completed the work which thou gavest me that I should do it" (@John 17: 4). It was finished in absolute completeness. *Then* He takes up this *present* service to render
{106}
saints competent to enter into the pleasure of God and thus become worshippers. 'Ears digged', @Psalm 40; 'ear opened', @Isaiah 50; and 'ear bored', @Exodus 21 all bring out *perfection*.
Ears digged is @Hebrews 10, "A body hast thou prepared me"; conditions prepared for Him, all involved in His taking a body. All the conditions were divinely formed and prepared. He filled up the whole term with perfection. It suggests the formation of all the conditions. In Him we see love active in *obedient* Manhood. Innocent and fallen manhood are marked by lawlessness, but here is a manhood marked by perfect *obedience*. It is the perfect contrast to everything here; every word, every act, profoundly delightful to our souls, detaching us from lawlessness and bringing an enlarged knowledge of God into our souls.
Rem. He brought obedience in.
C.A.C. There is no power in thinking, I ought to obey; but there is moral power in coming under the influence of the obedient One -- obedience that comes out of, and is carried on to eternity, giving effect to all the pleasure of God.
Ques. How were God's thoughts declared? (@Psalm 40: 5).
C.A.C. All come to light in Him who came into the world to do the will of God.
'Ears digged' suggests the depths to which the obedience of the Lord would have to go. The climax of all was when He went into death, there removing all that was contrary to the will of God and effectuating all that was pleasurable.
Ques. Why, in verse 5, is it "toward us"?
C.A.C. The Lord is identifying Himself with those the Father had given Him. 'Digged' suggests a going down; having taken that place and carrying on the service of God, He morally could not have gone back to heaven until His term of service was completed. "Lo, I come ... to do thy will, O my God". A voice out of eternity had said that, and it involved death, and had in view the setting apart of a worshipping company, capable of appreciating God and all His pleasure. He is never 'Lord' to me until I see His supremacy in the service of love, and that He has *secured* all blessing for
{107}
me. An exercise of spiritual affection in the power of the Holy Spirit enables you to say 'Lord' to Jesus. It bows you in worship as He exercises his powerful influence over you. God has made obedience attractive to us in Christ. I have not a blessing apart from obedience: "This is my body, which is for you" (@1 Corinthians 11: 24) -- the whole obedience for us; He brings Himself before us thus every Lord's Day. The whole compass of it, the depths to which He had to go, the results of it all "for you". We are thus brought under his supremacy in love.
Ques. How are we to understand @Hebrews 5, "He learned obedience ..."?
C.A.C. I should connect that with @Isaiah 50. There was infinite suffering in that path that the pleasure of God might be established.
Ques. Why is it the 'opened ear'?
C.A.C. There is the thought of a completed whole in "This is my body, which is for you"; but in @Isaiah 50 what attracts the heart is what is set forth in detail "morning by morning". It is not looked at as a whole as in @Psalm 40, but as in periods. Where did every word come from? *From God*. As you read the gospels, connect every word and act of His directly with the blessed God as the Source. The Lord spoke every word as an *instructed One*. What a study for the heart to bend adoringly over the detail of such a path as that. In @John 4, @Luke 7, etc., we see weary hearts. The word translated "disciples" in @Isaiah 8: 16 is the same as that translated "Instructed" in @Isaiah 50, the true Disciple. Every morning -- what about the detail as to ourselves? Fresh instruction every morning from the Lord. "Unto the obedience ... of Jesus Christ" (@1 Peter 1: 2) is what we are called to. All His service becomes the revelation of God to us; a Man who said every word in obedience. "As I hear, I judge" (@John 5: 30). We judge according to the hearing of the ears and seeing of the eyes; but *He* as He heard from the Father. Into a world of darkness and lawlessness such a person has come. If we want to know God we must come under His service and thus be for
{108}
the pleasure of God and be worshippers. Suffering tests us. The Lord says, "I was not rebellious"; it refers to the fact that He was to be exposed to every indignity from men. How wonderful! Job was very rebellious. Job's friends morally smote him and plucked off his hair, and he could not stand it. His friends criticisms tested him. Nothing tests us like adverse criticism from our brethren: how few of us could then say, "I was not rebellious" (@Isaiah 50: 5). The Lord took everything from the hand of God, gave Himself up, suffered all, as accepting all from His hand; gave Himself up to take whatever he sent, who would in the end righteously judge (see note, Darby translation). He awaited God's justification. That is the spirit of Christ. We can all accept things that come direct from God, but what comes from the brethren tests us most. Accept it from God and leave Him to justify you. If you justify yourself, you hinder God from justifying you.
In @Exodus 21 Christ is the true Ark of the Covenant. The whole divine system will be irradiant with the knowledge of God. We come together Lord's Day morning as the sanctified company. In @Exodus 21 you get outside the term of service. The Lord looked forward all His life to the conclusion. There is absolutely no limit to what you may gain by the present service of Christ. Do you love Him enough to let Him serve you? The Lord is always seeking opportunities for the outlet of His service. The Lord is seeking to draw us to Himself -- a person to be continuously believed on. It all moves from His own side. "I love my master, my wife, and my children". He dedicates Himself to serve them for ever. His place as Great Priest is part of His service. Have we taken character from Christ in this blessed way?
"For the arms of our warfare are not fleshly, but powerful according to God to the overthrow of strongholds; overthrowing reasonings and every high thing that lifts itself up against the knowledge of God, and *leading captive every thought into the obedience of the Christ*" (@2 Corinthians 10: 4, 5). Everything that obscures our knowledge of God; every
{109}
thought led captive by the obedience of love -- that is what God would produce. Every *thought* (that goes to the root of things) led captive. "My assembly"; such a company! -- untouched by Satan (@Matthew 16) -- led in. What is ministered from the Head flows through the joints and bands, that is, every one of us who has a sense of how Christ can serve us; what volumes flow from Him.
Ques. And what is the result?
C.A.C. The blessedness of sonship, outside limitations. His lordship is that He is supreme in love, effecting in us that we may be for God (@1 Corinthians 8: 6). "We by him", that is, all effected for God in Christ's service of love.
@Exodus 20: 24 speaks of the burnt-offering, which is the sacrificial side of things, @Exodus 21 of the living service of Christ effecting His work in us, and if we are to be worshippers we need that service.
DIVINE RESOURCES IN THE WILDERNESS
@Exodus 25:1 - 9
C.A.C. Shall we continue to look at divine resources for the wilderness, in view of our being identified with God's testimony? God's thought in furnishing people for the wilderness was that His testimony might be in their midst, and that their affections might be distinctly linked with the testimony. Would it be profitable to take up this line?
Our attention was called this afternoon to the fact that it is God's pleasure and intention that we should walk in newness of life, an entirely new manner of life, and that is Christ's life. His life was one of absolute dependence on God, God perfectly confided in, and a life of absolute obedience to God, God known and loved. We are very poor things to face a life of that kind. Well, we have resources, grace from
{110}
heaven, the manna, and no one could say the grace of heaven was insufficient to carry us through. Then we have the Spirit; the resources in the Spirit are very great and wonderful. The people came to Elim where there were twelve wells of water. The effect of accepting the will of God would be that we should find ourselves in God's assembly. If man's will disappeared and only God's remained, you would have no sects or systems; you would have the saints in God's assembly, in all the good of the blessed administration of the Spirit. The will of God is the only thing to control us, and if we are set for God's will, we shall find our place in God's assembly, because it is there that God's will is valued and known. The assembly is in contrast to this world; it is composed of those who have heard God's will and done it; they are Christ's brethren morally.
Rem. A great deal of our weakness flows from our not listening to Christ's ministry. He came to reveal God. The great supper and discipleship, in @Luke 14, fit in with what you were saying. Christ was here teaching men and making communications from God, and yet He has to speak of those who do not value the grace that He brought. God wants to fill His house.
C.A.C. And God's intention is to dwell in testimony; the end in view is the testimony of the Lord in the wilderness. In @Exodus 15 there are two ends in view: the 'abode of God's holiness', verse 13, that is the wilderness; and 'the mountain of His inheritance', verse 17, that is the land. We might speak of what is brought about in the wilderness; we are not perhaps up to the land.
God, in teaching us the new manner of life, teaches us what He is in Himself, in the boundlessness of His grace. That is the lesson of Exodus down to chapter 18. If the people are hungry, they are fed; if they *murmur* for food, they are fed; if they murmur for drink, they are given water. God is making Himself known in grace. He says: 'I am determined your murmurings shall only manifest My grace'. We
{111}
may find bitterness in our hearts because of God's ways with us; it is natural, and these exercises come up, but everything that arises on the people's part only serves to bring out what God is. God says: 'I am trying to prove to your heart what a good thing it is to be on covenant terms with Me'. "I have borne you on eagles wings and brought you to myself". Then He proposes to them, to have a covenant. His object was that they should take hold of a covenant. It is a crucial moment with us when we take hold of God's covenant. In Isaiah we are told of the blessedness of the man who takes hold of the covenant (@Isaiah 56: 4, 6). It means that with our heart and soul we fall in with the terms God proposes, and they are, that His will is to be everything. His will is a will of blessing, and when we see that, we take hold of the covenant. The Israelites put themselves under the covenant in a wrong way, and God has set that before us so that we should come into the covenant on terms of grace. See what grace God has shown us! We have all been subjects of His grace, He has brought us to Himself, and He has given us to prove what He is for us. He would encourage us to prove what He is more and more.
Rem. He delights in being for the benefit of His people.
C.A.C. God speaks of "thousands of them that love me". What a delight to Him to have a people that love Him! He brought them where there was nothing but Himself; it was not to the wilderness He brought them, but to Himself. We get not only food (that is strength) in the manna, for we could not take a step without the strength that comes to us, but we also get the water. There are the twelve wells, the smitten rock, and the springing well. Water suggests the thought of refreshment in the affections. We need not only grace, but if we are to be kept bright and happy, we must be refreshed in our affections. There is nothing the saints need more than this; there is a real need of being refreshed in our affections. We settle down to a matter-of-fact sort of christianity, orthodox doctrine and correctness of walk.
{112}
Ques. What is the water in @John 4?
C.A.C. @John 4 corresponds with the springing well; it is in view of going up to the land, that our affections may flow in the direction of the land, but Elim is for the wilderness.
We have a great tendency to get dull in spiritual affection, the effect of business and the humdrum of life; God knows all about it, and has provided for the refreshment of our affections; this is of vital importance. In the assembly in the wilderness, set forth by Elim, you get the administration of the Spirit. If you think of the assembly according to God, the Spirit is there, and it is all for the refreshment of the affections of the saints. Our tendency is to become orthodox and correct, but it will not do for a living God; He looks that there should be a living spring in the affections of His saints.
I covet this, the blessed action of the Spirit, keeping our affections living.
Rem. We get the love of God "shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit".
C.A.C. Yes, @Romans 5 is the water from the smitten rock. The Spirit there is presented as coming to you in direct connection with the death of Christ, and He refreshes your heart with that. The water from the smitten rock suggests that the death of Christ becomes the means of our having the Spirit, and the effect of the Spirit is a living spring of the love of God in our hearts, so that the love concentrated in Christ's death is now diffused in millions of hearts.
Now suppose we had been converted in the first century, hearing the gospel from Peter or Paul, what would be the first thing we should do? To come together in assembly. The converts clave to Paul and Barnabas, and in their cleaving to these men, you see the assembly in principle. There was a company of persons cleaving to those who brought the good news of God, and then in the assembly you find the Spirit administering, and distributing to each severally as He will.
You see in twelve wells perfect administration; one speaking, another praying, another prophesying, and the affections of the saints being refreshed.
{113}
Ques. What do the palm trees signify?
C.A.C. The triumph of God. I have often thought that 1 Corinthians is the firmament of His power; and the assembly, properly speaking, is the place where you would get the firmament of His power; an unbeliever coming in would see His power. They say in the world, so many men and so many minds, but in the assembly you have, as at Pentecost, three thousand men and only one mind; that is God's triumph. It is not people agreeing to differ, but thousands of people and one mind.
Ques. What do you understand by the firmament of His power?
C.A.C. The expanse in which God works. There is a great deal about power in 1 Corinthians: Christ is the power of God, the cross is the power of God, the Spirit is the power of God, resurrection is the power of God. The administration of the Spirit is all in connection with God's power.
Then we have the water from the smitten rock; that is the direct fruit and answer of the death of Christ, "the love of God shed abroad in our hearts". There is a living spring in the affections, and they are kept bright. The idea of God's assembly is that you have a people of one heart and one mind, one affection and one thought.
Ques. What about the sanctuary? You said that 2 Corinthians was the sanctuary.
C.A.C. Every bit of the sanctuary came out of the affections of God's people, so we must first have the way God secures and refreshes the affections of His people. The blessed work of grace goes on refreshing our affections; how is it done? By all that has come to light in Christ. If I have a bit of Christ, that is a bit of gold, or a precious stone for the sanctuary. All here (@Exodus 25) is figurative of Christ as become the possession of His people's affections. Each one brings his bit; that is, every saint has some particular impression of Christ. One Israelite had a stone, another a piece of gold, or silver, or brass, and under the distribution of the Spirit each saint has some impression of Christ in his
{114}
affections. Now put that all together, and let it come under the ordering of Moses, and it will all be fitted together in divine testimony. The whole system of divine glory in Christ is not in display yet, but it is made good now in the affections of millions of saints. We see the whole system of glory made good, a tiny bit in me, and a large piece in you; it is distributed in the affections of the saints. Testimony is God giving light amid darkness; there will be no testimony in heaven. The ark is not spoken of as the ark of the testimony after the crossing of Jordan; after that it is called the ark of the covenant, or the ark of the Lord, which shows that testimony is connected with the wilderness. Testimony belongs to what is antecedent to display, to what is not in display yet. I am not connected with the testimony, save as it lives in my affections.
Rem. Love is what makes everything fit together. We see that in @1 Corinthians 13, nothing profits if we have not love.
C.A.C. Yes; we see diversity of gift and operation in chapter 12, unity of affection in chapter 13, and unity of mind in chapter 14. What we are to each other is the testimony. God has set a certain system of affection in movement among His people. "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves" (@John 13: 35). The testimony is rendered by our being in right relation to one another. The assembly properly is the place where all that is divine and glorious is known. What Christ is Godward, and what Christ is manward and officially, is held in the affections of a company of people in this world.
Rem. The man who brings the white linen is himself the white linen; he has something ministered of Christ to himself, and he has appropriated it.
C.A.C. Exactly; that is most blessed.
Rem. For instance, we are not to talk of being meek, but we are to show the meekness of Christ.
C.A.C. It is a great thing to have substance; it is not what I know. Paul could say to the Corinthians, "The testimony of Christ is confirmed among you". He was telling them that to
{115}
exercise them; everything was set up in Corinth, but it had to be entered on with reality. You might have someone so poor that he could only bring a pin for the tabernacle! No one in the assembly, no sister need hold back and think, 'I am no good'. The sisters all have power. We ought to be more concerned as to what we bring; we bring something in our affections, an impression of Christ. One need not hold back because one has so little; it is precious, and it is necessary to the testimony. I might be less than the least of all saints, but supposing one pin were missing in the tabernacle, or if one pin were not in its right place, there would be disorder, and things would not be according to God.
Rem. Just as in @1 Corinthians 12, we have the body, and if one finger were short, the body would be incomplete.
C.A.C. We ought to feel that we cannot do without the smallest of our brethren.
Rem. We are not called to judge of our own importance.
C.A.C. We think if a man has a gift, or even if he can talk, he is of some importance, but perhaps some bedridden old saint may be of more importance to God. The thing is, we ought to covet to minister much, not to content ourselves with little, but to covet earnestly to bring something that would be positive enrichment to the saints, and would give glory to the testimony.
Rem. So, importance is not measured by what part people take orally.
C.A.C. Quite so. What we bring to the assembly is there, and if I bring Christ, it is power, and we should all get a greater measure of liberty and power.
Ques. What makes the difference in meetings?
C.A.C. Well, what makes the difference in people? It is a question of how much we have taken hold of the covenant; it all comes back to that. We see what God can effect; there is a picture of it here; the people brought so much that it was said they brought "much more than enough" (@Exodus 36: 5). We have, in David's time, another example of how enormously the people gave (@1 Chronicles 29).
{116}
There is an expression, used twice in Scripture, which is very remarkable. In @Genesis 6, God says, "Every imagination of the thoughts of man's heart is only evil continually"; and David when the people gave so enormously, said: "keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people" (@1 Chronicles 29: 18). Man in the flesh is all evil, but man in the Spirit is all devoted to God. If you read Jeremiah, chapters 24 to 32, you will see what God will bring out in the affections of His people in a coming day; and all that He is looking to bring about in our hearts now.
If souls are not free in a meeting, there is often anxiety that something should be done, and it lacks life. We should bring power. A brother who takes part ought to be carried by what is in the meeting, and we have often experienced that a brother gets up and is carried quite beyond himself; he ought to be carried beyond himself by the unseen power of affection in the saints. In taking part everything is measured by edification. I ought not to take part except for edification; we use our judgment as to this. If there is a long pause, I should take part if I were free, because long pauses are not for edification. I should take part because I have something of God before my heart, and then that is edification. The assembly is not a place where we come together to sit and wait. No assembly of men comes together to be in silence; they come together for business to be transacted. If there are exercises in our hearts, they should be gone through before we come together, so that if we have something of what we have been speaking about in our souls, we should be able to bring it out for the good of the assembly.
{117}
THE ANOINTING
@Exodus 30: 22 - 33; @2 Corinthians l: 21, 22
God seems to be calling attention at the present time to the anointing. The tabernacle was constructed in all its parts according to the commandment of Jehovah, but it had to be anointed before it was hallowed as a vessel of divine service. The first epistle to the Corinthians corresponds with the setting up of the tabernacle; it is spoken of as the Lord's commandment; but in the second epistle we have the teaching as to the anointing, for we read that God has anointed us. It is a beautiful, hallowing thought, giving completeness, as it were, to what was in the divine mind. The virtue of the anointing is seen in that epistle as exemplified particularly in Paul, but in view of its coming into evidence again among the Corinthians. And it did appear in measure in the saints at Corinth as seen in the second epistle.
The Old Testament expands for us in a typical way the thought of the anointing. Believers sometimes have the idea that the New Testament explains the Old, but in point of fact it is more often that the Old Testament explains and amplifies the New. We should understand very little in detail of the various aspects of the death of Christ, if we had not Genesis, Exodus, and Leviticus. The Old Testament opens it out, and we learn much from the typical scriptures that we should never learn from the New Testament alone. So the instructed scribe brings out things new and old. The new comes first, and the old develops the new. Believers generally come intelligently to the understanding of Scripture in the reverse order to how the Scriptures stand in our Bibles. The epistles ground us in the righteousness of God and the truth of the assembly, and then we appreciate the blessed Person portrayed in the gospels -- the One who has brought everything to us, and in whom we find fulness of grace and
{118}
truth. The gospels are, indeed, the supreme part of Scripture. Then we are prepared to go to the Old Testament, and see the hidden wealth of the types, which has been so fully brought out in these last days of the assembly's history.
When the apostle tells us that the saints of the assembly are anointed, he is sending us to the Old Testament to inquire what this means. God has set up an anointed system of things, and we must see that we understand it according to the teaching of the type. In the tabernacle everything was secured through the exercises and affections of the people of God. God's work consists in putting the features of Christ in the hearts of the saints, that they may become material for the tabernacle and suitable to the anointing.
The anointing oil was a skilfully compounded preparation "after the work of the perfumer", and I think we have to distinguish it from the Holy Spirit in relation to other parts of the truth. In the holy anointing oil there was not only olive oil, but the "best spices" were incorporated with it; the oil was the medium in which they were blended. Features were seen typically in the anointing oil which are additional to what is set forth in the olive oil alone. So that we have here in type a more developed and extended thought than the simple fact of having the Spirit. Those who have the Spirit should be concerned about the spiritual blending which is here said to be done "after the work of the perfumer".
The spices to be blended in the oil are described as the "best" spices, and we are told in @Exodus 35: 27 that they were brought by "principal men". This would connect such products with those who are, in a spiritual sense, wealthy persons. The Spirit has told us of the ointment which Mary brought that it was "very costly", so that we may conclude that she was a woman of some means. We should be ambitious of spiritual wealth; that is, what God will estimate as such; and this is, indeed, all the product of His own grace and work. The second epistle to the Corinthians is a fine epistle to enrich people, and thus enable them to bring costly things.
Paul says, "Making many rich". He speaks of the Lord Jesus
{119}
Christ becoming poor that we, through His poverty, might be made rich. The ministry of the new covenant, the ministry of reconciliation, the truth of new creation are great divine enrichments of the people of God as set in relation to the anointed system of holy things.
The myrrh and cassia are in double the quantities of the other spices. They represent, I believe, features of the Spirit of Christ which can only be fully appreciated by divine Persons. Myrrh speaks of suffering according to the will of God. This is a feature that can only be rightly or fully estimated by God. It is an essential constituent of the anointing oil; therefore none of us can suppose that we are in the virtue of the anointing unless there is with us preparedness to suffer for the will of God. We may see this fully in the Lord Himself, and it was also developed in great measure in his faithful servant Paul. All through the second epistle to the Corinthians there is a vein of suffering. God has peculiar pleasure in a people prepared to suffer for His will. The assembly in Smyrna was marked out as a suffering assembly. Smyrna means myrrh. They were a rich people spiritually; the Lord said to them, "Thou art rich"; they could furnish myrrh in abundance. We often become impoverished spiritually because we yield to the natural tendency to avoid suffering when it comes in the way of doing God's will. Still the saints *are* suffering at this moment in many ways, and in some parts of the world in a special degree. There is a good deal of evidence, even today, that the assembly is a suffering company. And the readiness to suffer is one proof that the anointing is upon the saints. It is good to know that there are boys and girls at school prepared to suffer for the name of Christ; it is the virtue of the anointing.
I understand that cassia is supposed by some to be a fragrant *root* known in the east, and, if so, I think it may be regarded symbolically as expressive of that *depth of* feeling which will ever be found accompanying the Spirit of Christ. The world is marked today by very little depth of feeling, and this is to be observed in the religious part of it as much as
{120}
anywhere else. But lack of feeling is abhorrent to God. He loves men like David and Jeremiah, Paul and Timothy -- men whose inward feelings were in a marked way expressive of the Spirit of Christ. Cassia is a large ingredient of the holy anointing oil. Paul had to write a letter to correct a sad state of things at Corinth, but he tells us that he wrote it "out of much tribulation and distress of heart ... with many tears". He speaks of having no rest in his spirit; his whole soul was moved in an agony of concern. Such depth of feeling pertains to the anointing; it can only be acquired in nearness to Christ, and by the supply of His Spirit. The natural tendency is to become like the world and not feel things. The Psalms show us that David was a man of deep feeling; no doubt this was one thing that made him a man after God's heart; he was in a peculiar way a vessel of the Spirit of Christ. The Spirit of Christ is the anointing; His own deep feelings are a precious and holy mystery which will never perhaps be fully unveiled to us, but there is enough made known to show how intense they were. Never was such feeling! Then Paul and Timothy were men of tears; this was one way in which the virtue of the anointing was expressed in them.
The cinnamon and the sweet myrtle represent what is more external, for cinnamon is the bark of a tree, and it is the flowers and berries of the myrtle which are fragrant. So that if the myrrh and the cassia represent inward features which God alone can fully appreciate, the cinnamon and sweet myrtle typify, I think, features of the Spirit of Christ which the brethren can appreciate. The fragrance of the Spirit of Christ coming out in the saints is intended to be appreciated by the brethren, and it is part of the virtue of the anointing that it should be so. God will not be content to have things right merely in a doctrinal or legal way; He would have them right in the grace of the anointing. @Colossians 3: 12 - 15 may be taken as a sample of the cinnamon and sweet myrtle of the anointing. Such features are to mark us in our relations as brethren. Let us not be content with the assurance that we
{121}
have the Spirit, but let us see to it that as the result of the activities of the Holy Spirit there are in evidence these precious fragrant features of the Spirit of Christ. So that we are not only able to say precious things to God, but the grace of the anointing in which we serve God is upon us in all our relations with our brethren.
The fragrant graces of the Spirit of Christ are not acquired in a practical way apart from exercise, and that blending which is described typically as being "after the work of the perfumer". In result there is a holy anointing oil which becomes a hallowing of all the vessels of service. The service of God cannot go on apart from this hallowing. And when we think of the service of God it is important to remember its greatness and universality. The service of God is really what pertains to the whole assembly as anointed. It does not pertain to the saints as a small company, but as a great and hallowed company. Even if there are only two or three actually together in a locality they are privileged to voice the praises proper to the whole assembly, and thus to represent it in character for the present pleasure of divine Persons.
We may be assured that saints in the power of the anointing will be preserved in a sense of spiritual realities in their true divine greatness. Such will not drop down to a human level. If in the virtue of the anointing, we shall refuse to recognise that anything is suitable to the service of God that is not in accord with His mind. In the holy service of God not a word should be uttered that would be unsuitable on the lips of the whole assembly on earth. May we all know more what it is to be in the grace and power of the anointing!

READINGS AND ADDRESS ON LEVITICUS
{124}
{125}
THE NEW MEAT-OFFERING
@Leviticus 23: 1 - 21
What we get at the end of @Acts 2 is the "new meat-offering" -- the fulfilment of what was typified in the feast of Pentecost. The new meat-offering refers to Christians, as set together in the power of the Holy Spirit, and I have turned to this scripture because it brings before us, in a figurative way, different things which need to have their moral effect upon us, if we are to be found here truly as part of the new meat-offering.
There are four feasts mentioned in the verses I have read: the passover, the feast of unleavened bread, the feast of first-fruits, and Pentecost. It is in connection with the latter that the new meat-offering comes in.
Just a few words about what we find at the beginning of the chapter -- "the sabbath to Jehovah" (verse 3). When God looked upon everything that He had made, and found it "very good", He rested on the seventh day from His work (@Genesis 1: 31; @Genesis 2: 1 - 3). But it is interesting and important to see that God did not make known the sabbath to men until redemption was accomplished in type -- that is, until He had brought Israel out of Egypt (see @Ezekiel 20: 12). But from the beginning it was the mind of God to have a rest for Himself, and to have men to share His rest.
God rests in what is "very good", and when sin came in there could be no rest for God in anything that sin touched. The coming in of God's beloved Son introduced that in which God could rest. Of Him He could say, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight" (@Matthew 3: 17). That blessed One went into death that sin might be dealt with and removed to the glory of God. Now He has "ascended up above all the heavens, that he might fill all things" (@Ephesians 4: 10).
{126}
God's purpose is to head up all things in Christ, and thus bring about a sabbath -- a perfect rest -- for Himself, and He will have His saints to enter into that rest and share it with Him.
People think Christians are narrow-minded, but it is the man of the world who is narrow-minded; he is occupied with small things which will soon pass away; but the Christian is occupied with great things which will be permanent -- he looks forward to the time when Christ will fill the universe with glory, and bring in perfect rest for God. This is the great end of all God's ways.
But now let us look at the four feasts. The passover comes first. We cannot go farther until we know the import of this feast. "Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us" (@1 Corinthians 5: 7). Taking up the type of the passover I attach great importance to the words, "The blood shall be for you as a sign". The other side is often spoken of: "When I see the blood, I will pass over you" (@Exodus 12: 13). But I want to speak now of the blood as God's great token to men.
God has provided for His own glory in the death of Christ, and the blood is the token of this. God's will and thought is to bring men into grace and blessing, and the great token of this is the blood -- that is, the death of Christ. The blood is God's great token to men of what is in His mind; it is that by which He speaks to men in grace.
Of what is it the token? Well, it shows me, first, that I am under death and judgment. If Christ must needs have suffered that blessing might reach me, it shows in the most solemn way that I am under death and judgment. Why should He -- the holy, spotless Lamb of God -- die and bear the judgment if we were not under it? Many have not peace with God because they have never learned this. Think much, my friend, of the precious blood of Christ! What you are, and what you deserve, is seen by the fact that nothing but the death of Christ could make blessing possible for you. To see this produces true repentance towards God.
{127}
I have heard of some missionaries who went to Greenland, and sought for a long time to bring the natives to repentance by speaking to them about their sins and pressing the claims of the law. No result was produced until one day -- almost by accident, as men speak -- they spoke of the death of Christ as a sacrifice for sin. This did what all their previous efforts had failed to accomplish. Many were broken down in repentance and a work of God began. It is a great thing to learn the depths of your ruin and distance from God by the death of Christ. The blood is a token to you of this. Your condition is such that only by the death of Christ could blessing reach you from God. But if the blood is a token of my state and condition as under death and judgment, it is also a token that divine love has reached me there. God has sent His Son to die and bear the judgment. Love brought Him where sin brought me; He has gone into it all and under it all for me. By this I know divine love. How blessed to have such a wonderful token!
Then there is another thing. Not only has divine love reached me, but divine righteousness is in my favour. Now that Christ has died, the righteousness of God is in favour of man, and is made known in the gospel. Righteousness has been established by love and is in favour of man. The blood is the token of this. God's great voice to men is the death of Christ. The blood is the great token of His love and righteousness as a Saviour God. Have we kept the passover? Have we learned the great and blessed meaning of God's token?
Then the next thing is the feast of unleavened bread. This was in close connection with the passover -- as soon as the passover had ended the feast of unleavened bread began. All leaven had to be put away (@Exodus 13: 6, 7). Leaven invariably typifies what is evil. Turn to @1 Corinthians 5: 2 - 8: "Ye are puffed up". That is what leaven does. The Corinthians were not keeping the feast of unleavened bread; they had not purged out the old leaven. This is a far deeper thing than dealing with the wicked person. They needed to deal with
{128}
themselves. They had great spiritual gifts and endowments, but they were puffed up and their glorying was not good.
There was the working of leaven. This is a deeply solemn thing. If Christ has gone into death for us as our passover, how can we be puffed up or glory in the flesh which He died to remove? How can I wish to be a big man here, or to show myself off where Christ died for me? To do so is unrighteousness. If I have learned the meaning of the passover I must purge out the old leaven. I cannot allow self-importance. It may be there; I find it in my flesh, but I do not allow it; I judge it, and turn from it.
God allowed the case of this wicked person to arise that the condition of the whole company might be exposed, and that they might purge out the leaven that was working amongst them. If saints are puffed up they have no capacity to judge what is evil. There had been no allowance of the flesh, or of what was merely natural in the preaching of the apostle (see @1 Corinthians 1: 17; @1 Corinthians 2: 1 - 5). "Wisdom of word" would have emptied the cross of Christ of its meaning. It would have given a place to the man who was set aside there. God will not have flesh to glory in His presence. It is a terrible thing to think that man will use even divine gifts to exalt himself.
If I realise what I am there is no room for glorying in myself. "Foolish" "weak" "base" "despised", "things which are not" -- that is what I am. The only things we can boast in are the choice of God, the cross, and Christ. If I am really going after Christ I do not want to be important myself. If self-importance works we are in great danger of falling into Satan's hands. You may say that we all fail in this. Yes, but the great thing is, what are we after? What line are we on in mind and spirit? If after Christ we are set to refuse the flesh; God has crucified the flesh in the death of Christ, and we take the same attitude. "They that are of the Christ have crucified the flesh ..." (@Galatians 5: 24). The Spirit would certainly not give the flesh any place. "If, by the Spirit, ye
{129}
put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live" (@Romans 8: 13).
I trust God will exercise us all about this. It is not servile bondage; it is true liberty. If you lose your divine joy for a bit of self-gratification you are like a man throwing away diamonds for sand. We cannot afford to gratify the flesh; if we do we lose our divine liberty. A well-known servant of the Lord said, 'If I my tastes deny, when I might gratify, I suffer bitterly, but sweet is liberty'. Do not make any mistake about this, you cannot enjoy divine liberty unless you keep the flesh in the place of death where God has put it. You may fail in carrying this out, but are you set for it? It is better to fail with your face in the right direction than to get on well in the wrong direction. The Corinthians were full, they were rich and reigning as kings; they were going in the wrong direction.
Now we come to the feast of the first-fruits. This speaks of a risen Christ; Christ is the first-fruits in resurrection (see @1 Corinthians 15: 20, 23). The sheaf of first-fruits was waved on the next day after the Sabbath (verses 10, 11), that is, on the first day of the week -- the resurrection day. There is a moral order in these feasts. I do not think one comes to the apprehension of Christ as the First-fruits of a resurrection order until the Passover is known, and the feast of unleavened bread kept. Paul presented the cross to bring the Corinthians to self-judgment, before he spoke to them of Christ in a resurrection order.
"To be accepted for you" (verse 11). It is a great thing to know a Man of another order as our acceptance before God. Not many understand the moral import of the resurrection, that it introduces an entirely new order of things. In @1 Corinthians 15 where the apostle speaks so much of resurrection, the great point is that there is an entirely new order. We have been of the order of the man made of dust, but we now belong to the order of that blessed Man who is of heaven. He is the heavenly One -- the First-fruits of a resurrection order.
{130}
We learn the blessedness of our acceptance now in Him, and at His coming we shall be divested of every trace of the man made of dust, and we shall bear the image of the heavenly One.
Our acceptance is set forth in that blessed Man of a resurrection order. Many believers live too much in the Old Testament. They think of being purged with hyssop so as to be clean, and of their sins being made white as snow, and their transgressions being blotted out as a thick cloud, but they remain on the old ground of men in the flesh. The Christian is on a new footing altogether. The risen Christ is the measure of his acceptance, and of his clearance. It is a blessed thing to see Christ as the Sheaf of first-fruits; it takes us off the ground of good or improved self. By divine grace we are of the order of the heavenly One, and very soon we shall have actually left flesh and blood, and shall be conformed to His image.
Then fifty days (verse 16) after the waving of the sheaf of firstfruits came the feast of Pentecost, when the new meat-offering was waved before Jehovah. The saints of the assembly are the new meat-offering. In the absence of Christ God secures a company on earth to bring out in that company the blessed perfection of Christ. Note that as to the two wave loaves, "with leaven shall they be baken" (verse 17). There was to be no leaven in the meat-offering of @Leviticus 2, which represented Christ personally, but in the new meat-offering there was leaven. But mark well, the loaves were "baken". Baking arrests all the action of leaven. God deals with us so as to arrest the action of the leaven. He brings the fire to bear upon us so that self-judgment is wrought in us, and the leaven does not work. If the flesh is kept under judgment the fruit of the Spirit comes out in the saints; Christ comes out in us for the pleasure of God; we become the new meat-offering.
We are in the feast of Pentecost now. At the end of @Acts 2 we see the new meat-offering -- three thousand people displaying the Spirit of Christ, walking in unselfish love, in
{131}
unity, and joy, and praise (verses 41 - 46). People think it was wonderful that they should speak with so many tongues, but it was far more wonderful that three thousand persons should be found in unity, and that the Spirit of Christ should characterise them all, so that none said "that aught of the things which he possessed was his own" (@Acts 4: 32). That was the new meat-offering, and that pentecostal company is on the earth still, and through grace we are part of it.
God's great thought is to bring Christ out in us. We first learn Him as our Passover sacrificed for us. Then we have to keep the feast of unleavened bread; there must be self-judgment. The first epistle to the Corinthians was all to bring them to self-judgment, to keep the feast. Then when they judged themselves the second epistle was written, full of the precious ministry of a risen and exalted Christ. In that second epistle we read, too, of God's discipline which comes in to help us by the practical setting aside of the flesh. Paul was helped by the "thorn for the flesh" (@2 Corinthians 12: 7). If we really desire that Christ should come out in us, God will help us. It is better to have a check put upon the flesh by the discipline of God than to have the best thing the devil could give you in the world. When the apostle was reduced to absolute weakness the power of Christ tabernacled over him. If the flesh is set aside and the power of Christ tabernacles over us, and the Spirit of Christ is in us, the result will be that the life of Jesus will be manifest in our mortal flesh. We shall be found here as the new meat-offering.
THE FEAST OF PENTECOST
@Leviticus 23: 9 - 21
C.A.C. We were looking at the passover and the feast of unleavened bread on Wednesday, and it was suggested that we should speak a little tonight about the feast of Pentecost in connection with the gift and presence of the Holy Spirit.
The first time that these feasts are referred to, this feast of
{132}
weeks or Pentecost is called the feast of harvest (@Exodus 23: 16). It would help us if we got very clearly before our minds that this is the time of God's harvest. God has sown and He has also reaped. God has His harvest at the present moment; it really came in on the day of Pentecost. We think sometimes of what we gain by having the Spirit but it would help us greatly if we started with the fact that the great point in connection with the Spirit is what God gains. Think of the wonderful way in which God has sown in His field, God sending His Son into this world, Christ going into death, what a sowing! What is to be the result of God's sowing? A harvest for God for His pleasure, the fruit of His own sowing. Do you not think it is helpful to see that? What did the Son of God come into this world for? To secure a harvest for God. The great object in view was that men might receive the Holy Spirit. Each gospel begins by presenting to us the Son of God as He who baptises with the Holy Spirit. That is His first introduction to us in the gospels. He came here and died here that God might give His Spirit to men and, if so, there is a harvest for God, something for His pleasure. Every Christian who has received the Spirit is part of the harvest from God's sowing. The gift of the Holy Spirit is too great to be received on any other ground than on the ground of what God does Himself. How could He be given or received on any other ground? There is a harvest that springs from God's sowing. The church on earth, as composed of all who are indwelt by the Spirit of God, is the result of it. The gift of the Spirit is the evidence of the value of the death of Christ. The first type of the Spirit given is in @Exodus 17. Moses smote the rock. The water flowed from the smitten rock. The death of Christ is the procuring cause of the Spirit being given. It is His death that is the ground for it. We think of the death of Christ in its efficacy in putting away sin etc., but the first result is that God is glorified in the highest. The great result is that the Holy Spirit of God, a divine Person, can be given to all who believe. It magnifies the death of Christ; it is of such value that through it the Holy Spirit can be given.
{133}
Rem. "He shall see of the fruit of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied".
C.A.C. That is right. There is a harvest for God. The object of the gift of the Spirit is that there may be a pleasurable result for God. What shall the harvest be of God's sowing? There must be an adequate result if God sends His Son to die here. It is a result secured at this present time. It is the day of Pentecost now. "When the day of Pentecost was now accomplishing" (@Acts 2: 1). Some think of it as having happened 1900 years ago but there is no time limit to the feast of Pentecost. And it is "the day of Pentecost", not 'days'. It is one of the longest days that has ever been. "And when the day of Pentecost was now accomplishing" or "running its course". It is still the Spirit's day and the time of God's harvest.
Ques. Would that be the thought in @John 4: 35, "Behold the fields, for they are already white to harvest"?
C.A.C. Yes, precisely; it is in connection with the giving of the Spirit. God is delighted with His harvest. He has had a good harvest, not a bad harvest. This is God's harvest-time. It is not the sowing time now from this point of view but the reaping time. It was the sowing time when Christ came here and died. But it is now the reaping time when we are brought into the present wealth of the Spirit to be for the pleasure of God.
Ques. Will the "trumpets" be sounded after this period?
C.A.C. The day of Pentecost goes on until the time when God will send out a new testimony for the gathering of Israel, which will correspond with the "blowing of trumpets". There is:
<ol>
<li>The sowing. God sowed when he sent his Son into this world. An old man said lately in connection with some tracts he was distributing, 'I like to sow the best seed'. God sowed the best seed. The seed God sowed and the harvest correspond.
<li>The sheaf of first-fruits.</li>
</ol>
The day of Pentecost was measured from the time when it was waved. It was waved
{134}
upon the first day of the week, speaking to us of the resurrection of Christ. "On the morrow after the Sabbath" He was raised and He was waved. He was both the Sheaf and the waving Priest. Every question of sin settled, the sins of His people put away, sin in the flesh condemned and all the consequences of their unfaithfulness also met in the barley sheaf, the Lord as taking up all the unfaithfulness of His people.
The jealousy offering is an offering of barley (@Numbers 5: 15).
And the prophet was told to take an unfaithful woman, in the type, and buy her with barley (@Hosea 3: 1, 2).
The Lord has taken all that up. It is a comfort to us, a needed comfort. The Lord has taken up and settled every question in His death, not only the question of our sins and our state but also the question of our unfaithfulness as believers. All was tasted on the cross. Not only my sins as unconverted but the many sins and unfaithfulness since then, all were taken up and God glorified about them. If He had not been glorified about it all we should perish eternally. Now, in resurrection, He has been waved "to be accepted for you".
You are transferred to the ground of a risen Christ. He was absolutely alone prior to that. A great many people are troubled and distressed about their unfaithfulness as believers.
I am not excusing that, God forbid. But our Saviour has borne the judgment of it, that we might stand eternally before God on the ground of a risen Christ.
Ques. What would you say as to @Hebrews 6: 4 - 8?
C.A.C. It confirms what I am saying. Those who are brought to faith in Christ are "sanctified" by the will of God "through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all".
Rem. But I was thinking of @Hebrews 10: 26, "where we sin wilfully".
C.A.C. Let us consider first @Hebrews 10: 10, "By which will (the will of God) we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all". Can any thing shake that? It is what Christ has done and what God has done. "For by one offering he has perfected in perpetuity
{135}
the sanctified" (verse 14). Could anything be more blessed than that? The saints sanctified and perfected for ever, not by any work in them, but by one offering. Their consciences are purged and every question settled. Nothing can ever shake them. Now we will come to "where we sin wilfully" etc. He is speaking of those who deliberately turn their backs on all this, give it all up and go back to Judaism. There is no other sacrifice for sins; they have given up the only Saviour and the only work that can put sins away.
Rem. It is apostasy.
C.A.C. Yes, a turning away and there is no other remedy. The fact that they turn away is clear proof that they have never been the subjects of the work of God. Nothing can ever be touched that is the security of our blessing. "And the Holy Spirit also bears us witness of it ... their sins and their lawlessnesses I will never remember any more" (verses 15 - 18). If a man is an apostate he never was sanctified, purged, etc. He might have been a "washed sow" but never a sheep.
Ques. We sing, 'Fruit of Thy boundless love That gave Thyself for us'. Would that be connected with the "firstfruits" and our being risen with Him?
C.A.C. We begin to count our weeks from that point. It is of the utmost importance that we begin to count from the resurrection of Christ. "And ye shall count from the morning after the Sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave-offering" (@Leviticus 23: 15). He is in radiant suitability to God's world. We count from that divine starting-point, the resurrection of Christ. We often start from ourselves and do not arrive at anything definite; we are working from self to God. But in the gospel I begin with Christ and God. My exercises start from God and from Christ, they are measured from the resurrection of Christ. You begin there, from the wondrous first day of the week when the wave-sheaf was waved for the acceptance of His people on the ground of the immutable value and precious worth of Christ. That is the ground upon which the Spirit is given.
"Ye shall count ... seven weeks" -- seven blessed weeks,
{136}
starting with the resurrection of Christ. It is so blessed and is an imperishable foundation for the soul with God. I knew my Saviour and had done so for some time but one day it dawned on me that there was a blessed Man out of death and in the holy splendour of resurrection, and that that Man was my righteousness and my acceptance.
Ques. You had a revelation?
C.A.C. No. It is revealed in the gospel. The gospel is the blessed witness of God to His risen Christ. He has given "the proof of it to all in having raised him from among the dead" (@Acts 17: 31). Happy the man who has got the gospel but miserable the man who has not.
Rem. "God commends his love to us".
C.A.C. Yes, like a draper when displaying some material to a customer, He sets it out to the best advantage. If only we started with God. "In the beginning God". That is where everything starts in the soul. I come in as a recipient of all the blessing that comes from God through Christ. I lose sight of myself and have God before me. Self nothing, God everything, Christ everything and the Spirit witnessing; that is the harvest. "To us there is one God, the Father, of whom all things, and we for him" (@1 Corinthians 8: 6). Is not that blessed?
Everything originated there -- "of whom all things". And then there is His harvest, "we for him". And how is it all brought about? "And one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things and we by him". It constitutes us pleasurable to God as His harvest.
Rem. That is very sweet.
C.A.C. And then the Spirit is the seal of the righteousness of faith. How do I get the righteousness of faith? It says, "Believing on him who has raised from among the dead Jesus our Lord, who has been delivered for our offences and has been raised for our justification. Therefore, having been justified on the principle of faith, we have peace towards God through our Lord Jesus Christ". It is settled. And "the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us". It never tells you in Romans
{137}
how you get the Spirit, because it is not your business at all but God's. God said, as it were, 'I am sending My Son into the world that He might give the Spirit'. There are no cut-and-dried ideas presented in the Scriptures as to the reception of the Spirit. There are hardly ever two cases alike. The instances in Scripture are most diverse. God gives the Spirit as soon as ever He can. His great object is that He might give the Spirit. "If thou knewest the gift of God". Is that the God I know? Yes, thank God. The love concentrated at Calvary is diffused now in this day of Pentecost. It is not what I get (although I get everything) but the first thing is what God gets, His harvest. There must be something commensurate with the actings of two divine Persons: the love of God and the death of Christ. The only possible thing to correspond with that is another divine Person. It is a threefold cord, the blessedness of God. No one else, none less than the Spirit of God, could shed abroad the love of God in a human heart. It liberates your heart and makes you feel blessedly free, counting all the time from the resurrection of Christ. Nothing could put sin away but death and nothing could put away death but resurrection. Start from the resurrection of Christ and make spiritual progress -- "seven weeks".
What a "seven weeks" for the disciples! They had the Passover and they had the Sheaf of first-fruits and the Priest of the wave sheaf amongst them (@John 20), and they began to count. "Forty days" in companionship with a risen Man -- what an experience!
Ques. "When ye come into the land that I give unto you, and ye reap the harvest thereof". What does that speak of?
C.A.C. It would speak to us of the purpose of His love, a rich foretaste of what the Spirit would be. During the forty days, all He said to them was by the Spirit (@Acts 1: 2).
Ques. "Speaking of the things which concern the kingdom of God". Would you say something about that?
C.A.C. The kingdom of God is this new order where God is supreme. He opened their understandings, Luke tells us. Then after forty days of assembling with them and
{138}
speaking to them by the Holy Spirit, He goes up, and for ten days they are in the light of an ascended Christ and find themselves in an "upper room". How could you live on the ground floor after that? They abode there, in the "dwellings" from which the wave-loaves come (@Leviticus 23: 17). What an experience!
Then the day of Pentecost came and the Spirit came and sat upon each one of them. God's harvest is secured in the power of the Holy Spirit. Then the two wave-loaves come out "baked with leaven"; they had been in the oven. Peter had not been there in @Luke 22: 33 when he said, "Lord, with thee I am ready to go both to prison and to death". But he had been there between then and @Acts 2. Peter was inflated in @Luke 22. He had never been 'baked' before the Lord died. We get 'baked' in the death of Christ, where all has come under the judgment of God. That is the fire where you are baked and the activity of the leaven is killed. Peter is an unleavened man in @Acts 2; he is speaking of divine Persons, not of himself. My father used to say that there was not much difference between high Calvinists and low Arminians because the former had bad self before them and the latter had good self before them, but neither of them had Christ before them.
The two wave-loaves of wheaten flour are of the order of Christ. The corn of wheat fell into the ground and died, and believers are the "much fruit" come out for the pleasure of God, as having the Spirit, the Spirit of Christ. Suppose I have the Spirit of Christ, I have something in me characteristically Christ. "If any one has not the Spirit of Christ he is not of Him; but if Christ be in you ...". There is something there as first-fruits for God, Christ in the saints by the Spirit now, in the day of Pentecost. But perhaps you will say, 'There is not much of Christ in some Christians'. The question is, have you the right kind of eyes or spectacles? If your eyes are anointed with eye-salve you will be able to see something of Christ in Christians all the world over.
{139}
Ques. As to the "one loaf" and the "two loaves", what would be the difference?
C.A.C. The "one loaf" would set forth unity, and the "two loaves" ability to be here in testimony, as adequate witnesses of Christ in this world, constituted such by the Holy Spirit. "Ye will receive power, the Holy Spirit having come upon you, and ye shall be my witnesses" (@Acts 1: 8). There has never been a moment since the beginning of the day of Pentecost in @Acts 2 till now, when there has not been a company on earth indwelt by the Spirit and constituted competent to witness to Jesus as "Lord and Christ". God is maintaining His testimony, and He did so all through the dark ages.
Rem. They loved what was of God.
C.A.C. They had the Morning Star. They looked for the coming of Christ.
Rem. They were looking for the day.
C.A.C. They had the Morning Star. The hymn wrongly says, 'The Star's in the sky' (`194:1). Peter says it is "in your hearts" (@2 Peter 1: 19).
Rem. As having the Holy Spirit, there is ability to walk in self-judgment before God that Christ may be expressed in us.
C.A.C. As there is self-judgment, there is appreciation of Christ. My appreciation of Christ is measured by my self-judgment. Grace reigns through righteousness, in self-judgment, and thus we are carried through to eternal life.
Ques. Is the Holy Spirit given in answer to desire?
C.A.C. It is a great pleasure to God when there is a desire, because God desires to give. I prayed for the Spirit after I had received the Spirit (I did not know it at the time) but my prayer was not displeasing to God.
Ques. What would you say about the "continual prayer" of the disciples during the "ten days" of @Acts 1?
C.A.C. They were praying for the fulfilment of the promise (@Acts 1: 4). It is a great pleasure to God when we are
{140}
exercised about the Holy Spirit. Obedience and dependence are the lines on which we get the good of the Spirit.
Ques. Can believers be like an ark?
C.A.C. The ark is the peculiar glory of Christ as Son of God. We can be the tabernacle (the true tabernacle) and temple of God; "The temple of God is holy, and such are ye" (@1 Corinthians 3: 16, 17). And our bodies are "the members of the Christ" and "the temple of the Holy Spirit" (@1 Corinthians 6: 15 - 20). We ought to be careful what we do with our bodies. What am I doing with my body as a "member" and a "temple"? If I think my body is my own, I do anything I like with it, but if I realise that I am not my own, I must take care. The real power of holiness is in recognising the presence of the Spirit. When we recognise the Spirit, we begin to use the Spirit. When I recognise His presence I begin to use the Spirit. "Do ye not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which ye have of God?" Have you not recognised it? Many Christians have not.
Ques. Would not "the fruit of the Spirit" be a great "harvest" for God?
C.A.C. Yes, in @Galatians 5: 22 we have a beautiful cluster of divine and heavenly fruit produced in believers -- God's harvest. We have to learn to distinguish between what is of the flesh and what is of the Spirit and to cultivate what is of the Spirit.
Ques. Is the Spirit here as a witness?
C.A.C. The Spirit comes to witness to certain blessed things. He is the seal to God's blessed testimony of grace, and He glorifies Christ in my affections, so that I have the blessed assurance that I am in the current line of the Spirit.
Rem. Rebecca rode on the camel and followed the man.
Ques. *Will you* tell us something about the "seven lambs" (@Leviticus 23: 18)?
C.A.C. What is the result of the two wave-loaves? Offerings, and every one speaking of Christ, not about me. The theme of contemplation and delight and that which is presented to God is Christ. The Lord, when walking with the
{141}
two disciples on the way to Emmaus, "interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself". Then it was that their hearts burned (@Luke 24: 32). We are in 'Doubting Castle' if self is before us but we are soon on the 'Delectable Mountains' if Christ is before us.
THE FEAST OF TABERNACLES
@Leviticus 23: 23 - 36
C.A.C. I thought we should continue what we have been looking at. We have considered:
<ol>
<li>The passover and feast of unleavened bread. </li>
<li>The wave-sheaf and feast of weeks. </li>
<li>Tonight we might complete the subject by looking at The feast of ingathering, or tabernacles. </li>
</ol>
Rem. I think you said that with regard to the day of Pentecost there was no limit stated as to its duration. Would you say that with the "blowing of trumpets" a new era or period is brought in?
C.A.C. All that we have read of this evening stands connected with the end of the year. We see that in @Exodus 23: 15, 16 where the three feasts are spoken of: unleavened bread, harvest, "and the feat of ingathering, at the end of the year". The passover, the feast of unleavened bread and Pentecost are all at the beginning of the year. They are connected with the beginning of God's ways. But the trumpets, the day of atonement and feast of ingathering are at the end of the year.
Ques. What does "the year" convey to you?
C.A.C. I thought it set forth the course of God's ways.
Rem. "The year of the Lord". "And having rolled up the book ... he sat down" (@Luke 4: 20).
C.A.C. It is a definite cycle. The months run in cycle and begin again. The ways of God are like that. The feast of
{142}
tabernacles or ingathering is the time when the harvest and vintage are gathered in -- God's goodness, bounty and favour gathered in and enjoyed. It is the finish. God's ways end in bringing His people into the full purpose of His ways in Christ. The apostle John commences his epistle with "That which was from the beginning", and the same apostle shows us the end. The beginning started in Christ and in the Spirit. The end is the full result of all the ways and purposes of God -- the city coming down from heaven.
It is a great thing to know that we have to do with a God who begins and finishes. He finishes. There is a remarkable verse in @Job 19: 25. The first part of the verse -- "I know that my Redeemer liveth" -- is well known to every Christian, but it continues, "and the Last, he shall stand up upon the earth". That is a remarkable statement to be made by a man like Job. Firstly, "I know that my Redeemer liveth"; secondly, He is "the Last". The Redeemer is going to have the last word. If God comes out as Redeemer it ensures the fulfilment of all He has in the purposes of His love. He has the last word.
Rem. "The first and the last".
C.A.C. In @Revelation 1 it is the Lord God who is the "Alpha and the Omega" (verse 8) -- God the beginner and finisher of blessing. But in chapter 22 it is Jesus: "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end" (verse 13). Everything that God begins and ends, He begins in Christ and He ends in Christ. What a sense of security and rest it gives to see that. There is at the beginning of the year the passover, and at the end of the year the feast of ingathering -- to be enjoyed. God wants us to know a little bit of that now.
Ques. The Redeemer is the passover?
C.A.C. Yes, and He is the Last; and whatever comes in between. Job learnt what a wretched being he was and repented in dust and ashes. God is the Last. You will find, certainly, that God will have the last word -- a word of infinite blessedness -- and His people will be put in the full enjoyment
{143}
of it. We all believe that He is the First but He is going to be the Last. The passover is the first but the feast of tabernacles is the last. All is gathered up and enjoyed that God has given His people. These feasts show what God has made possible for us to enjoy here. We may enjoy it now by the Spirit. They are part of God's ways, the unfolding of them, so that His people can enjoy them now.
God gave Israel a good start. They had the passover and the tabernacle amongst them, and were brought into the land. But they soon slipped away from it. They are not in the enjoyment of it now but are scattered for their sins. But is God going to leave it like that? No. "The seventh month" will come for Israel, all God's purposes for Israel will be fulfilled. There will be the trumpets to gather them, the day of atonement when they will repent and then the feast of ingathering enjoyed in the land.
In principle, it is just what God has done with the assembly. Pentecost is how God started the assembly. It was a good start, with Christ and the Spirit. But we have departed from it. I think we would all admit that we have departed from the great blessedness of Pentecost. The whole assembly has departed, things have come in that are neither Christ nor the Spirit. There is a profession of Christ in the world but christendom has departed from Pentecost and not continued in Christ and the Spirit. Could God leave it like that? and would He leave it like that? No. The time for the fulfilment of His purposes draws near and "the seventh month" is brought in. The time is very near. The Lord is soon about to come and the assembly will be placed in glory, Israel gathered and the kingdom set up. It is very near now. In view of that God has blown a trumpet.
Ques. "Behold, the bridegroom"?
C.A.C. It answers, for the assembly, to that. It began with the Reformation; before that the assembly was in darkness and death but God sounded a "trumpet", there was a "new moon", the light of Christ shone afresh for the assembly. At "the new moon" the moon comes again into the light
{144}
of the sun. It is only a silver crescent at first but it is in the light of the sun, and the crescent grows fuller and fuller each day. The Reformation answers to "the first day of the seventh month". Since then the light of Christ has been shining more and more. It is a day of revival, this "seventh month"; the trumpets are sounding; we have readings and preachings and books are circulated, all bringing us light as to Christ and the assembly. Have they not sounded in these parts? Surely we have had our feast of trumpets. And what is the effect of it? It leads to deep self-judgment and we confess that we have not been faithful to the light and privilege of Pentecost, to what God set up at the start. We admit it. "It is a day of atonement" (@Leviticus 23: 27 - 32) when the meaning and value of the death of Christ is brought home to us. God is now preparing us for the finish.
Ques. As to verse 25, "And ye shall present an offering by fire to Jehovah", what does that signify?
C.A.C. In any movement God brings about, there is a result for Him. Whatever light and help we get, the question is, 'What is there for God in this?' Not 'What is there for man' but 'What is there for God?' It is a great thing to come under divine instruction as to the death of Christ. It is a question of the people of God; if we have departed as the people of God from Christ and the Spirit, if we have got mixed up with other things, we have to repent of it and own it. All that is not of Christ and of the Spirit is contrary to the truth. The full blessing of God can only come in through the death of Christ. It must come in through the day of atonement. When God begins to work it is to lead us into the sense of what the result of the death of Christ is. There is nothing to be done, we have to be still. "No manner of servile work shall ye do".
I needed His death first as a needy sinner and second as having got away from the light and blessing of Pentecost.
Ques. Would @Isaiah 53 correspond?
C.A.C. Israel will keep their day of atonement. It is the great value of Christ as the sin-offering. It has made it possible
{145}
for God to fulfil every thought of His love. God would give us a deep sense of the death of Christ.
What is God's answer to the Person of Christ? That He has raised Him from the dead and put Him on the topmost pinnacle of glory. What is God's answer to the work of Christ? That every one of the redeemed is put in the full blessedness of the purpose of His love. That is His finish. He would have us come into it now and enjoy it now, here on earth.
Ques. Do we come into it individually?
C.A.C. We have to come into it individually and along with our brethren.
In the burnt-offering Christ secures for me a place in divine favour in the very spot where I was under God's judgment, in that very place. But the sin-offering, oh! it is wonderful. It is infinitely great, greater than the burnt-offering. The blood of the burnt-offering was sprinkled "on the altar that is at the entrance of the tent of meeting". But the blood of the sin-offering was put on the gold, on the mercy-seat, and on the ground of that we become "God's righteousness in him" (@2 Corinthians 5: 21). That is the result of Christ having become the sin-offering. We are eternally "the righteousness of God in him". It secures the justification, reconciliation and glorification of every one who believes on His name. God would give us to think much of it. It settles every question for the guilty sinner and the failing believer. Now God can set us before Himself "holy and blameless", "accepted in the Beloved", "blessed with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ" (@Ephesians 1: 3 - 7). All the result of the death of Christ.
The question is, 'Are we gathering up the harvest and the vintage?' Are we gathering it up and enjoying it? Read @Deuteronomy 16: 13 - 15. What a wonderful picture! God's people made "wholly joyful". It has come right out of the heart of God. "Blessed with every spiritual blessing ... in Christ". It is for us then to gather it up; on the ground of repentance and of the death of Christ we can appropriate it
{146}
all. The bondman, the handmaid, the Levite, the stranger, etc., everybody is taken in. It is a beautiful seven days. The seven days of the feast of unleavened bread speaks of a continued period of holiness. But this is joying in Christ, knowing that we are objects of delight to God. It is a fine thing when we just let God be true.
Rem. I suppose @John 7: 37 - 40 sets out the present enjoyment of it for us, in connection with the Spirit of God.
C.A.C. The feast all subsists in Christ. "If any one thirst, let him come to me and drink". Every thirst in the human heart is quenched. And from the one who drinks, "Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water". It is the feast of tabernacles for us.
Rem. It brings before us the greatness of the Spirit.
C.A.C. The Spirit is great enough to bring it in and to bring it in for those who have departed from Pentecost and been unfaithful. It is purely on the ground of God's mercy. The truth of the assembly has been restored. Sects are an abomination to God. They are a direct contradiction of what He has set up. This feast of tabernacles was to be held "in the place which Jehovah will choose".
Ques. Would Philadelphia answer to that, following upon Thyatira and Sardis?
C.A.C. Philadelphia shows how the Lord will secure a place at the end; we are brought back to it in mercy. That is the question for us, 'Is there a place now'? "The place which Jehovah will choose to cause his name to dwell there"? There was a place in Israel, but it is a remarkable thing that the people were in the land over four hundred years before God chose a place where He could put His name. See @Deuteronomy 12: 10 - 12, "Then there shall be a place ... thither shall ye bring ... your choice vows which ye shall vow" -- not till Solomon's time. David as the warrior, God's anointed, came in first and dealt with every enemy. Solomon could say that there was "neither adversary nor evil event" (@1 Kings 5: 3 - 5). As types of Christ, David is the great warrior
{147}
and Solomon the great builder. The builder was needed before the "place" -- the beautiful house -- could be built. It was to be "exceeding magnifical". The "place" was never there until the temple was made.
Rem. "And on this rock I will build my assembly, and hades gates shall not prevail against it" (@Matthew 16: 18).
C.A.C. That is the place. It is where the revelation of God in Christ is known and responded to; it is only known and responded to in that house which Christ builds of living stones. It is a more wonderful house today than what Solomon reared on the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite. There are many structures around us built by man, but there is only one built by Christ, and in that structure built by Christ, God has set His name and only there. Every sect in christendom arose with good intentions; men tried to improve on conditions that existed, but that is not good enough for God. What is built by the Son of God is divinely perfect; "Hades gates shall not prevail against it". The revelation of His Father is put there so that it can be responded to and in that place the feast of ingathering can be kept, outside of all that is of man. The structures reared by man are all coming down but in finding our place in Christ's structure we can rejoice and keep the feast of ingathering (see @Leviticus 23: 40). What a beautiful sense of shelter and luxuriance these "beautiful trees" suggest -- the luxuriousness of the land -- as we think of the people sitting down under them. It is like the place that God would have us in now, sitting down and thinking of the contrast between the wilderness and the land. The wilderness is where we experience God's care; it is in one sense as wonderful as the land, but it is not the place where God can rest, nor is it of rest for us. But the land is the place of His rest. He can rest and we can rest. He can rejoice over us with singing and rest in His love. God would bring us to it now in the blessedness of all that He has secured for Himself in Christ. "And ye shall rejoice before Jehovah your God seven days". We can praise God for all the blessedness and
{148}
wealth of Christ. Christ is the preciousness to us so that we can speak of it to God. "Spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ" (@1 Peter 2: 5 - 7).
Rem. The question should be with us, 'Has God got His part?'
C.A.C. His joy among His people. We ought to consider seriously whether we are taking this up in a spiritual way. We shall be set in the full blessedness of God's purpose in a moment when Christ comes, but what about now? Is God missing what is due to Him at the present moment? Let us leave everything that hinders this. We shall go in later on and come out in the heavenly city. It is all brought about through redemption and is as powerful now as then. We can come into all the blessedness now of what God has found for His own pleasure in Christ.
{149}
READINGS AND ADDRESSES ON NUMBERS
{150}
{151}
A SPIRITUAL LEAD IN EVERY LOCALITY
@Numbers 7: 1 - 17
C.A.C. My thought in suggesting this scripture was that the Lord might help us, as together, to realise that we have to do with a holy system of things which is entirely of God. It is not simply something that is a little better or more moral than what is going on around us in the christian profession, but we are called to be in relation to things which are entirely of God. God would have us to be increasingly conscious of that. On the divine side everything is complete. We read of the true tabernacle which the Lord has pitched and not man. There is no element of the world in it, no element of the flesh. So that what we find in @Numbers 7 is that the twelve princes who offered were men who had a profound appreciation of the holy character of the system that was set up amongst them -- the glory system as seen in the tabernacle in type. And as having an appreciation of it they could, without any specific instruction, act in relation to it. They could offer what was suitable and they could dedicate the altar. Now it seems to me that that is our side. And I would suggest that in the princes we get the principle of a spiritual lead given in every tribe. There is no such thought contemplated as a tribe without a prince. And we have suggested here the thought that in every tribe there is a spiritual lead given which is suitable to the testimony. It is suitable to the divine system which had been initiated and hallowed by Moses, indicating to my mind that the Lord intends that in every local assembly there shall be a spiritual lead, so that what is suitable shall be found in each.
{152}
Ques. Would you confine the idea of a tribe to a particular local assembly?
C.A.C. I think the tribes, as occupying different locations in regard to the one tabernacle of testimony, represent the local assemblies.
Rem. The Lord would look for this element that would respond spontaneously to His own thoughts.
C.A.C. I think we should be much exercised that in every local assembly large or small there shall be an element of spiritual lead which is in correspondence with the divine system. So we find that there must be a certain spring of spontaneity. There was that in the princes, because there is no commandment; the offerings in this chapter are not prescribed. Now the spring of spontaneity is that we become conscious of the exceeding blessedness and value of what God has introduced. And a spontaneous movement of heart is always originated by a sense of the preciousness of what has come in, like the offerings of the magi in @Matthew 2. They come with their choice offerings because their hearts were impressed with the blessedness of what had come in; and so with the holy women that anointed the Lord, they were impressed by the surpassing excellence and worth that was there, and it became a spring of spontaneity. I think if we had a greater impression of the precious character of what God has brought in and set up in Christ and in the power of the Spirit it would produce spontaneity; that is, we should do things that nobody ever did before.
The system is a spiritual system, and we must remember that the great tabernacle system is as spiritual today as when it was first set up. The failure of the assemblies and the breakdown of the christian profession has not affected the tabernacle system at all. The Spirit never departs from the original idea. The whole thing was set up in the power of the Spirit, and the Spirit is still here, and therefore the power which is suited to the system is here to be utilised, if we are spiritual enough and affectionate enough to desire it. There is a remarkable word in @Malachi 2: 15: "The remnant of the
{153}
Spirit was his", indicating to me that the Spirit will never depart from what He began with.
Rem. The tabernacle that the Lord pitched is in the midst of a hostile scene, so that intelligence marked the offerings of these princes.
C.A.C. Quite so, and do you not think that they seem to have been impressed by the onerous character of the service? It was a service which made great demands on all those who were engaged in it, and the thought of the princes -- a thought by which I think the Lord would affect us -- showed that they considered that the testimony was precious and holy and so entirely of God. Being surrounded by a hostile scene the weight of the service bears heavily, if one may so say, on all those who engage in it, so that the first exercise of intelligent affection acting spontaneously is to facilitate the service -- so they bring waggons. Now I believe the Lord would have that element in very strong evidence in very local assembly.
Ques. You would say that there is nothing irksome about the service?
C.A.C. Nothing irksome, but extremely laborious. Think of the labour of the apostle Paul. Can you imagine anything more spiritually diligent and laborious than his continual care for the assemblies? It is not irksome in the sense that you have to do something that you are not minded to do, but it seems to me that if you think of the nature of the testimony and the character of the world in which it has to be maintained, you will see that it involves strenuous labour, and it makes a demand on all the saints to do whatever we can to facilitate levitical service, so that it may not bear heavily on those who are rendering it. They are to be relieved and assisted and helped in every possible way.
Ques. What is the thought of the covered waggons?
C.A.C. I think the princes had drunk into the suggestion of chapter 4, that the holy vessels were to be covered; that is, the things connected with the testimony of the Lord are not for public display. They are not for the natural man. There is a certain secrecy which is preservative. If we want to make
{154}
the things of God public we must reduce them to the level of the public.
Rem. That is an extremely important point; the treasures are to be kept secret in the treasury.
C.A.C. Exactly, and that is involved in the very word 'mystery'. I suppose the most characteristic word in the present time is 'mystery'. That is, things are covered; they are only known to those who are initiated, and they have to be preserved from all the contaminating influences of the wilderness. That is the idea of the covered waggons. The wilderness is a place of death and uncleanness, and the holy things have to be preserved, and the levitical service has to do with the carrying of the holy things through such a scene. We need to be preserved from the idea that the precious things that we have can be connected in any way with the present world's system.
Ques. I was going to ask what is the thought of each of the princes bringing exactly the same?
C.A.C. I thought it was most helpful to see that the spiritual lead which the Lord would bring about in every local assembly is not only marked by unity but by uniformity.
Rem. So the smallest tribe brought just as much as the largest tribe.
C.A.C. The spiritual lead given to Manasseh, where there were thirty-two thousand, was just the same as that given to Judah where there were seventy-four thousand. The spiritual lead in the smallest meeting is to be precisely the same as the spiritual lead in the largest meeting. I believe that is very important. We might say we are just a handful here and we do things in a very simple way. Well you may talk like that till you lose sight of the august character of the system that you are connected with. If we have to do with a spiritual system, a glory system, every element in it is of God, and the system is just as great in the smallest meeting as it is in the largest. So that the spontaneous response would be as adequate in the smallest meeting as in the largest.
Rem. The system is not local.
{155}
C.A.C. No, the system is not local, and that is very important because it puts us outside merely local conditions and you begin to think of the elements of spiritual leading. I do feel that we ought to be more exercised as to this. I cannot think of a local assembly without having the element of spiritual leading in it, and this element would tend to the liberation of service. It will tend to the liberation of levitical service, and the levitical service will be regarded much more gravely, more seriously, and we shall be careful as to the principle of facilitating it -- providing waggons which are accessory. They do not form part of the spiritual system, really. They are a suggestion of love. Now I believe in christianity there is room for every suggestion of love. It is not a cut-and-dried system.
I think in this way you would find that the ordering of things would be marvellously unified, and the assemblies would be marked by uniformity and great diligence to facilitate the work of the Lord. We may forget the dignity connected with the work of the Lord. We think of the limitations, and perhaps the smallness and poverty of apprehension of those who put their hands to the work, but we must beware of all that. The principle is, "Let a man so account of us as servants of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God" (@1 Corinthians 4: 1). The Corinthians had a degraded idea of the service; there were men who were competing even with Paul. Now this spirit of competition and rivalry is abhorrent to God, and it would never be found in our hearts if we were dominated by the glory of the divine system. And I believe, moreover, that a greater sense of the dignity of the service would dignify the servant. If a brother comes to expect criticism and disparaging remarks it tends to lower the holy dignity of his service. I believe many a brother's service might be glorified if he were more appreciated according to God. A brother would realise that nothing short of divine power and the grace of the anointing would commend him in any service that he might render, and the general idea of facilitating and promoting the work of the Lord would have a reflex
{156}
action on every individual who put his hand to it; it would tend to elevate the whole character of the service.
Ques. Did not Jehovah express His special delight in this act? He says to Moses, "Take it of them".
C.A.C. Yes, it is very beautiful, "Take it of them". It was a spontaneous suggestion of love, and I believe there is room for every suggestion of love in the divine system, because a suggestion of love would never interfere with divine order. Love is the most orderly thing in the universe.
Ques. Would you say that that corresponds with, "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these"?
C.A.C. Well, that would dignify the least, and I really believe that we do not think enough of ourselves in a divine way; that is, we accommodate ourselves to a low level of thinking about ourselves, but we should think about ourselves as the apostle says to the Romans, "think soberly". Now, what is sobriety of thought? To think according to the measure of faith.
I think it is most important that the work of the Lord should be facilitated, and that we should realise that a spiritual lead would be in that direction, that the smallest bit of service would be highly esteemed, and we should not like to do anything to put a brake on it; we should like to put it on wheels to facilitate movement.
Rem. I was looking at the first paragraph of the next chapter where the Lord begins to speak, after all this is done. He gives orders as to the light. The Lord will begin to speak to His people and will give heavenly light and in an advanced way.
C.A.C. I think that is the way of it. These things are most important in the estimation of God. So that every bit of the ministry of Christ is precious and we ought to remember that the ministry of Christ is amongst us. Now the thing is to facilitate the carrying of all the precious ministry because there will not be anything for God if the work of the Lord is not prospered. The work of the Lord secures edification
{157}
amongst the saints. It secures the bringing in of new material, and it secures the development and increase of what is there. So we want the work of the Lord locally. We ought all to be able to say, 'We are only half a dozen in this place but the work of the Lord is going on amongst us'. No spirit of barren criticism, but every one putting his shoulder to it. Have you noticed that remarkable scripture in Zephaniah, that they all serve Him with one shoulder? (see @Zephaniah 3: 9). That is everyone putting their strength into a collective shoulder so that the work of the Lord is promoted. I think we are far too casual about the work of the Lord.
Rem. It is the unity of the fellowship, because there are six waggons, but twelve princes.
C.A.C. That is, the principle of co-operation runs right through it. We sometimes confound fellowship with cooperation, and I think it is very important that we should learn to distinguish the two. Now in connection with the waggons it is co-operation, so that there is no prince that has a waggon to himself. It seems to require two princes to be adequate to the idea. "If two of you be agreed"; it is the principle of agreement and co-operation in what we are doing. It is very precise. Co-operation, of course, must be in the light of the fellowship, but it is a different idea from fellowship. It is the practical side. Each prince brings an ox, a figure of steady purposeful labour, but the ox is to pull in a yoke with another. There is no idea of it working singly. In connection with the work of the Lord I believe co-operation is essential. John and Peter go together. We find Paul works with the twelve. Of course if you get two like John and Diotrephes you will not get co-operation; they could not pull together in the same yoke. But there is the principle of pulling together, and I believe that is the test: can I pull with another brother? Many a man has energy but he is not sufficiently governed by the divine system to subordinate himself to the restraint that is involved in pulling with another. We need that in every local assembly. I am more and more
{158}
impressed by the great need of the recognition of the work of the Lord locally. All the Levites should submit to this yoke of co-operation, which I can assure you has a practical effect in shutting out the action of the flesh. If I go simply on my own, there is a great deal of room for what is of the flesh, but if I have to move in co-operation with another, and especially if he is a spiritual man, there is a wholesome restriction on the flesh in myself, and if I am a spiritual man that is just what I shall take pleasure in. I take pleasure in being reduced.
Rem. We were noticing the principle with Prisca and Aquila, they had only one neck.
C.A.C. They were really governed by the testimony, so that anything that was merely personal was effaced in the presence of the glorious character of the testimony to which they were committed. What a privilege to subordinate one's self in order to further what is connected with the divine testimony, to give more scope to what is of God and what is of Christ and what is of the Spirit -- to go on with the remnant of the Spirit. It is a fine privilege.
Ques. It says of all these offerings that they brought them before the tabernacle. Does that mean that they each one had the divine centre in view?
C.A.C. No doubt they had, and their offerings were taken of them. I believe God will accept everything which involves personal cost, but which is a suggestion of love in relation to the work of the Lord. He will accept it all, the smallest thing as well as the great things, and make it contributory and accessory to His blessed system of glory.
Then we must not leave out the thought of the altar. It is the second great element in spiritual leading, the dedication of the altar. I suppose we are all prepared to accept that the altar has been anointed and hallowed; we have not to do that, that was Moses part. That is, there is a way of approach to God; it is anointed and hallowed, set up in all the precious value of Christ and His death, and of the Spirit. But now the dedication of it depends on us. The altar has to come into use
{159}
in every local assembly. The dedication is equal in every tribe.
Ques. Why is it not connected with the mediator rather than the priest?
C.A.C. The mediator had to do with the inauguration of the system. The system is inaugurated by Christ as Mediator, and it is sustained by Christ as Priest; but then there comes in a third exercise and that is the exercise of the brethren, the local brethren. There is what Christ does as Mediator and what He does as Priest, but that does not obviate the necessity for the exercises of the local brethren. The altar is not dedicated by any service of Christ either as Mediator or as Priest, it is left to the brethren.
Ques. Do we gather that there must be an apprehension of what has been set up before we can act becomingly with regard to it?
C.A.C. I think that is the idea, so that having a right apprehension of the altar, which is particularly prominent in this chapter, the princes could supply what was perfectly suitable to such an altar; and the princes give the same kind of lead in every tribe. Whatever spiritual lead there is everywhere throughout the world will be in the same direction.
It is remarkable that the first exercise is that there shall be suitable vessels. Before there is the actual thought of offering there is the exercise as to suitable vessels in which to put the meat-offering and the incense. That is, there is the thought of silver and gold vessels, which I should link with @2 Timothy 2. Silver vessels and gold vessels are vessels to honour.
Rem. It is each day -- the whole time that the testimony is here.
C.A.C. The twelve days are a complete administrative idea, covering all the time, so that God had such pleasure in these offerings that He would spread them over twelve days. They are twelve days of profound pleasure for God, because what is being brought before Him each day is Christ.
{160}
Rem. It should be very stimulating to see that we might minister pleasure to the heart of God by recognising what is valuable here.
C.A.C. Yes, and you get certain essential features. You get the thought of vessels, and if you think of the oblation it is most important, because if Christ is to be brought to God how abhorrent would be the idea of His being brought in an unsuitable vessel. It would be detestable. You must have a suitable vessel -- vessels of silver, and they are not all the same size. Indeed it does not mention the size of the vessels, but their weight, which is, in itself, a suggestion of the weighty character of the way in which our souls have apprehended the grace and faithfulness of God as found in redemption. It seems to me that that is the thought. And there is a certain difference, two vessels were much larger than the other, suggesting to my mind the sovereignty of God in permitting in His service that, although all the vessels are equally suitable, they are not of equal dimensions.
Rem. I was thinking of the time of recovery when Cyrus weighed out all the vessels; the weights are given.
C.A.C. Yes, and it is important to know that the balances of the sanctuary are always in action to weigh us. We are being weighed all the time. Now my exercise ought to be, what is my weight? I may be able to speak -- many of us can talk, but that may have no weight. You will sometimes find that a brother who says very little may have great weight locally, and everybody feels that he is a large vessel, that he has a large appreciation of Christ in oblation character, the fine flour mingled with oil. It is the thought of what Christ is personally -- not anointed with oil, but mingled with oil. What he is as anointed is what He is officially, but as mingled with oil it is what He is personally, what He was from the moment of His conception in the womb of the virgin. So that all the perfection of His life was blended with what was of the Spirit of God. His humanity was altogether unique. You cannot detach the Spirit of God from a single feature in the life of Jesus from the manger to the cross. How dreadful it would
{161}
be ever to suppose that He was either personally or relatively anything but of profound delight to the heart of God. We must not forget that. We are apt to dwell on the anointing, which is official; but "mingled with oil" is connected with the divine holiness of His person from His conception onward, and this is really for the altar.
In the divine system you have room for differentiation between one saint and another. We are not all the same weight, we are not competent to carry the same measure, but it is according to the faithfulness of God and the ordering of God and we can happily accept it. If another brother is a more weighty vessel than I am, that is a gain to me; if he carries more of the preciousness of Christ, that is a gain to me. And what comes to the altar nourishes the priests, and if I am one of the holy priesthood I get it for food, so that it is all to my advantage that another brother should be a weightier vessel than I am. I do not need to be jealous of him; I should not like to be without him.
Rem. It cuts at the root of clericalism.
C.A.C. Quite so. I think we should be with God as silver vessels, that is, not according to flesh or nature. As a silver vessel I am not regarding myself as in mixed condition at all. I am regarding myself as set in relation to God in the value of redemption. I am set in relation to God by the one offering of Christ which has perfected me for ever. The preciousness of Christ is connected with me, and we must learn to divest ourselves of every other thought.
I suppose that the smaller vessel of gold is important; because it shows that the dedication of the altar gives us the freedom of the holy place -- that is, you come in to the golden altar. If there is a vessel full of incense it can only be used at the golden altar. The silver vessel is the result of discipline; that is, it is the result of the purification of the furnace that there come out vessels for the refiner. And none of us become silver vessels apart from the disciplinary dealings of God with us.
{162}
THE LEVITES: THEIR REDEMPTION, CLEANSING, INHERITANCE AND DEVOTEDNESS
@Numbers 8: 5 - 18
There are four things very distinctly prominent as to the Levites, of which I may speak as their redemption, their cleansing, their inheritance and their devotedness. And by the Lord's gracious help I should like to bring these things before you.
There was a marked difference between the twelve tribes of Israel and the Levites. The twelve tribes took their place in connection with the declaration of their pedigree; that is, they got their place by natural descent, and the Levites were not numbered among them. *They* got their place on another ground altogether; peculiarly on the ground of redemption, and if I may so say they traced their pedigree to the passover. You find it distinctly stated in @Numbers 8: 18, "And I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel". You see, God had secured the firstborn for Himself by putting them beneath the shelter of the blood and now He takes the whole tribe of Levi in place of the redeemed firstborn; so that they had their place and privileges in a peculiar way on the ground of redemption; they traced their pedigree to redemption. Beloved friends, that is where *we* start.
There was no difference whatever between the Egyptian's firstborn and the Israelite's firstborn; the extreme penalty had passed alike upon them both, and the only difference between them was that which God made. As we are told in @Exodus 8: 23, "And I will put a redemption between my people and thy people" (see note).
{163}
The death of Christ is the amazing witness to the righteousness of God. I may say the very first element of the divine work in our souls is to impart a conviction that God must be righteous in all His ways. There is nothing for the evangelist, who preaches the gospel, to work upon until that reaches the soul. The death of Christ is the vindication of the righteousness of God. There could never have been a testimony of God's hatred of sin as there was when Christ died to bear its judgment. We see it declared in such a way that he is left righteously free to extend His grace to a world of sinners! He might have vindicated His righteousness by universal desolation, but now pardon can be proclaimed to the perishing millions of Adam's race. Not even the devil can raise any question as to the righteousness of God. What a mighty, what an amazing thing this is to start with! We are convinced that God must be righteous in judging sin and we fall in with God's righteousness. Have you fallen in with God's righteousness? Are you so convinced of the necessity of His judgment -- that it must come upon sin -- that you are glad to fall in with the fact that God has judged it in the death of Christ? Then you will see the righteousness of God is in your favour. Oh! that precious blood! Thank God, it is available for every sinner here tonight; that which declares God's righteousness is available for you. The blood of the Lamb secures everything for you.
The Levite was taken on the ground of the value of the blood, but we must remember, although as I have been saying the blood secures everything for the one who is beneath its shelter, that was not the chief thought God had in view -- His chief thought was to have a people for *Himself*. Every sheltered firstborn son was also sanctified, as we read in our chapter, verses 17, 18. It is a *people* for God. What a dignity this imparts to every one that is beneath the shelter of the blood! We are set apart to be a people for God; it is an immense thing! Now, can you declare your pedigree? Any pedigree that is not traced to the value of that blood is worthless now
{164}
and for eternity; and every soul that is beneath the shelter of that blood is *secured for God*. The blood settled everything, that God might have a sanctified people for Himself. That is the first thing.
The second thing is a necessary consequence, and what we have brought before us in this chapter is the second stage -- the *cleansing of the Levite*. He has his place on the ground of redemption and now he had to be cleansed; although the blood has settled everything on God's side there is an absolute necessity that those who are brought under the shelter of that blood to God should be in *moral suitability to God*. So Moses is commanded to take the Levites from among the children of Israel and cleanse them.
There are three things in the cleansing as you get in verse 7, "And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: sprinkle upon them water of purification from sin; and they shall pass the razor over all their flesh, and shall wash their garments, and make themselves clean". This is a figure of the way in which the redeemed company is morally fitted to be a people for God. There is no other way for us than the way set forth in type and figure here. We have got to be cleansed so as to be in suitability to the God who has sanctified us for Himself.
The water of purifying here spoken of is the water of purification for sin which we find in chapter 19. The heifer was taken and burned outside the camp, and cedar wood, hyssop and scarlet were cast into the burning of the heifer, and when all was consumed the ashes were gathered up and mingled with water and it was a water of purification for sin. It was the remembrance, brought home to the soul, of a fully executed judgment. The heifer and all that went with it had been absolutely consumed and this was applied in the running water (which was a type of the Spirit) in power to the soul.
If you want to get in the New Testament what answers to it I will turn you to @Romans 8: 3, "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, having sent
{165}
his own Son, in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, has condemned sin in the flesh". It is when the value of the blood is perfectly known by the soul that another kind of exercise begins; that is, we begin to find that, although we are completely clear before God in all the efficacy of the blood, there is a great deal connected with ourselves that will not do for God -- nay, I can go further than that -- that will not do even for ourselves! I suppose there is not a person in this room who has not been in a greater or lesser degree dissatisfied with himself. Even in the world this is so -- I heard of Professor Huxley saying the other day that if some great power would engage to make him always think right and do good, on conditions of being turned into a kind of clock to be wound up every morning, he would instantly close with the offer.
The Christian is not merely like the man of the world, irritated at being lowered by what he finds in himself, but he feels the shame, the sorrow and gravity of what it is in the eye of God; he has a capacity to judge it in a divinely given way. Beloved friends, we have to learn that sin attaches itself to the very life we possess; it is interwoven with every fibre of our moral being as children of Adam! This is a truly solemn discovery to make. Do you know what it is to be a partaker of *sinful flesh*? SINFUL! It is an awful thing to think of, that what sin is was never fully expressed in the devil -- he dare not express what sin is. The awful thing is that he has taken possession of man and made a plaything of him and led him to express the awful horror of what sin is in a way he dare not express it himself! He dare not have struck the Son of God in the face, or lifted a hand to drive in one of those nails. It is man that has shown what sin is, and when I see that awful crime of Calvary -- the creature raising his impotent hand against the Creator -- I see man rid himself of God, and I say that is SIN! And because sin has come out in man, it has been completely judged in him; the blessed Son of God has come in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin. But beloved friend, have you really learnt it? Oh! I feel it is the question
{166}
at issue today especially for the young saints -- that our very life as children of Adam can only be rejected of God, condemned by Him.
Many times when I have been speaking to young Christians I have asked them 'Have you an ideal -- some lovely ideal in your mind -- of what you would like to be?' I pity the man that has not an ideal; such a man is not worth his salt. You say, 'Oh! if I were only this or that'. You have your ideal and you are not happy because you cannot come up to it.
Suppose by your own effort you could rise by self-examination and self-denunciation to your ideal, what would it be? Beautiful SELF! Oh! how satisfied you would be with yourself, and although you might ascribe it to the grace of God, yet it would be the grace of God making YOU into a wonderful person, and I am afraid a great many Christians are not any further than that. I say that is not Christ. All that might be a credit or an ornament to me must go.
The cedar wood, man in his greatness; the hyssop, man in his littleness; and the scarlet, man in his glory, must all go. Why are not believers happy? Because they have not something they can glory in. If they could only have something attached to themselves in which they could take a pride, but they cannot. God intends you should learn in the language of @Romans 7: 18, "For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, good does not dwell". And when you come down to that you are prepared to see that the whole thing must be condemned -- root and branch. Everything that constitutes your life as a child of Adam must go. Are you content that it should? That you should not have a single vestige that you can boast of in yourself? Oh! it must all go. Thank God, it has gone in the cross, "God, having sent his own Son, in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, has condemned sin in the flesh" (@Romans 8: 3). It is gone! gone! And the sprinkling of the water of separation is the application of that to your soul in the power of the Spirit, and that is the first element in moral cleansing. All that I am is gone, and henceforth I am not seeking to find a
{167}
single germ of anything in myself to which I can turn in self complacency.
The second thing is, "And they shall pass the razor over all their flesh". You see, it is very evident if the whole thing has gone in judgment from before God (and I am glad that it should go) I cannot go on tolerating it. It is monstrous. The razor must pass over. Everything that is the natural outcome of the flesh must be cut down in judgment. "If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live", @Romans 8: 13 (Authorised Version). It has got to be cut down in the power of the Spirit. You get it in @Galatians 5: 24: "They that are of the Christ have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts". And in @Colossians 3: 5, "Put to death therefore your members which are upon the earth". The razor must pass over the flesh, there must be the judgment. And this is the practical test as to whether the water of purification has been sprinkled upon us. The measure of self-judgment in the power of the Spirit is the measure in which the water of purification has been sprinkled upon us. There is to be no toleration of that which is evil. God has condemned it and I fall into line with Him.
The flesh is a crucified thing; it is not to have any place or recognition, and I put to death my members which are upon the earth.
And then there is the third thing, "And shall wash their garments, and make themselves clean". The washing of the clothes is a figure of the Christian coming out in a new character altogether. If you want it in the epistle to the Romans you get it from chapters 12 to 15. You find he comes out in a totally new character. If you would like to see him in four different spheres you might read the last verse of @Romans 12: "Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good". That is in relation to those that are against you. There will be a good deal against you if you are really set to be for God. So in relation to your enemies you overcome evil with good.
Then as to all the lawfully constituted powers, "Let every
{168}
soul be subject to the authorities that are above him. For there is no authority except from God; and those that exist are set up by God" (@Romans 13: 1). The duty of the believer is clear -- it is one of subjection. There is no instruction to the believer as to how he should record his vote because by doing so he would be taking a place as "ruler".
Then go on to verse 14: "But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not take forethought for the flesh to fulfil its lusts". This is as to one's personal character. If it is an enemy we are to "overcome evil with good". If it is the powers of this world we are to be in submission, and if it is our own personal character, we are to put on the Lord Jesus Christ. What a complete change of character! It is like washing the clothes, and if we do not put on this character what is the good of taking a place in service for God? You see you are not cleansed. This finds us out in the home circle: many a man can be nice in the meeting and perhaps speak unkindly to his wife.
Then in chapter 14: 19, "So then let us pursue the things which tend to peace, and things whereby one shall build up another". This is amongst your brethren. In every circle, whether it is in the presence of the enemy or of the powers of this world, in my own personal character; or in the assembly amongst my brethren, everywhere the believer comes out in a new character. This is the way of the cleansing, and the effect of all this is that there is a *people for God*.
So, to go back to Numbers you find that the Levites were brought and were offered to God (chapter 8: 11). "And Aaron shall offer the Levites as a wave-offering before Jehovah from the children of Israel, and they shall perform the service of Jehovah". They are taken up and presented to God, this company of Levites, to be altogether for God. They are received in the efficacy of the sin-offering and in the sweet savour of the burnt-offering. It is a blessed thing to know that when we are presented to God it is in the absolute clearance of the work of Christ and it is in the infinite acceptance of the sweet savour of His death, and we are then appropriated by
{169}
God -- as He says in the end of verse 14, "That the Levites may be mine", and in verse 16, "For they are wholly given unto me", and in the end of that verse, "Have I taken them unto me". God appropriates this company altogether for Himself. If you want it in the epistle from which I have been reading (Romans) you get it in chapter 12, "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the compassions of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your intelligent service. And be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God". There is a company of Levites and they are all presented to God now for His satisfaction and pleasure. Beloved, have you got that idea of christianity? I do not say it is the highest platform; but it is a wonderful thing that God has wrought in His grace, and the great object He had in view was that we might be a company *altogether for Himself*. You find in chapter 15: 16 he brings the Levites and waves them before God. "For me to be minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, carrying on as a sacrificial service the message of glad tidings of God, in order that the offering up of the nations might be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit". The great thought Paul had in going out to preach was to bring a people to God: when the apostle was preaching he was going as a priest to find a company of Gentiles that he might bring them to God as a wave offering. It greatly elevates the thought of the gospel if we bear this in mind: God wants a people here in this world for Himself. The Lord was the true Levite here absolutely for God; now He is gone and what is there left? Well, a company of Levites, and I trust most here have the Spirit-wrought desire to be a person here for God.
Another point I want to speak of a little, is the inheritance of the Levites, and I turn you to @Deuteronomy 18: 1, 2, "The priests, the Levites, and the whole tribe of Levi, shall have no portion nor inheritance with Israel: Jehovah's offering by fire, and his inheritance shall they eat, but they shall have
{170}
no inheritance among their brethren: Jehovah, he is their inheritance, as he hath said unto them".
Now I have often had to say that one can see very distinctly how the children of this world are wiser than the children of light. The man of the world knows his portion and he goes in for it, and yet, alas, many of God's children do not; they do not go in for it; the result is they do not enjoy it. Unless we go in for it we shall not enjoy it.
If you want a verse from the New Testament in connection with this I would like to read @Romans 5: 5, "And hope does not make ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us"; also verse 11, "And not only that, but we are making our boast in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom now we have received the reconciliation". I read these verses because here it is we touch the source of all blessing; and not only touch it, so to speak, but the source is positively put into our hearts. So that it is not like something at a distance from me, but the love of God is shed abroad in my heart. How wonderful that He should give me His Spirit in order that my heart might have a capacity and capability to taste of His love. How could I taste divine love if His Spirit were not given? Impossible! Oh! beloved friends, I confess to you I feel how little my soul oftentimes is in the joy, power and blessedness of the gospel as it is revealed here. Oh! the overwhelming blessedness of it. The little sense of it that one may get occasionally breaks over the heart like a flood of divine joy! We joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ. This is the Levite's portion. Not that he is getting on a little better in this world, not that his circumstances are changed, but he is brought to God and joys in what is the outflow from that Source.
In @1 Corinthians 2: 9, 10 it says, "Things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that love him, but God has revealed to us by his Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God". Now we come to the out
{171}
flow. If I have found the source of all blessing in the heart of God Himself, what is the outflow from that Source? There are things that eye has not seen, nor ear heard, and they are revealed to us by the Spirit. That is our inheritance. What is it but an outflow from the heart of God? Oh! the blessedness of being brought into it; brought into the things that come out from the heart of God. And what is the response? Ah! there is a response on our side, you may be sure, if we know what it is to reach that source. You get it in @Colossians 3: 1 - 3: "If therefore ye have been raised with the Christ, seek the things which are above, where the Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God: have your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth; for ye have died, and your life is hid with the Christ in God". Where are the things that God has prepared for them that love Him? They are in another world, in that world where Christ sits at the right hand of God; they are hidden. We need to take it to heart that the believer's life is a hidden life -- it is not in manifestation at all. So if I want to know really what it is to enter into my life, to live in my inheritance, I must seek the things that are above. We only practically have the enjoyment of our life as we seek the things that constitute it. It is hidden. Just as the glory of the Son of Man is hidden -- we are told in @John 13: 32 that He is glorified in God. There is not a ray of His glory seen in this world. Ah! it is not in manifestation. If we know the source and the outflow does it not awaken our hearts to seek the things that belong to our inheritance, and that we may really seek to take possession and be attracted to that place where our inheritance is at God's right hand?
There are a few words I would like to add as to the Levite's devotedness. @Exodus 32: 26 - 28 says, "And Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, He that is for Jehovah, let him come to me. And all the sons of Levi gathered to him. And he said to them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Put every man his sword upon his hip; go and return from gate to gate through the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his friend, and every man his
{172}
neighbour. And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men". Now just a few verses from @Deuteronomy 33: 8 - 10, "And of Levi he said, Thy Thummim and thy Urim are for thy godly one, Whom thou didst prove at Massah, With whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah; Who said to his father and to his mother, I see him not, And he acknowledged not his brethren, And knew not his own children; For they have observed thy word, And kept thy covenant. They shall teach Jacob thine ordinances, And Israel thy law: They shall put incense before thy nostrils, And whole burnt-offering upon thine altar".
It was a terrible day for Israel in @Exodus 32 -- Moses had gone up to the top of the mount, was in the glory above, and forgotten by the people below: practically forgotten. All allegiance to Moses and to Moses God was thrown off by the people. And in the presence of that all-devouring fire and clouds and thick darkness you see a man on his knees modelling a golden calf! Who is that man? Aaron, the only man named in Scripture as a saint (@Psalm 106: 16). The people strip themselves of their ornaments and give their glory to a calf. They had forgotten Moses and the God of Moses. Beloved friends, is it not so today? Our Moses has gone on high and oh! how much He is forgotten! And what is the effect? When Moses is forgotten the people of God must have something to look at, something on earth if their hearts lose sight of that object in heaven. The great mass of the hosts of Israel today have before them an object on earth other than the Object that is in heaven, and that is idolatry.
It was an awful day. Do you not think it meant a violent wrench of many natural ties, a violation of much that was dear to nature, when they went through the hosts and slew every man his brother? Ah! it was a stern business. I will tell you this, if you are set to be on the Lord's side you will find it will be incumbent on you to violate natural ties; you will have to go in the face of those who are dear to you, and with the sword drawn where you least expect it.
{173}
If you cannot draw the sword against that which has the strongest natural hold upon your heart you will never know what it is to be in the position of the true Levite. It is not that you are insensible to the natural tie, but when it is a question of the will of God and of being on the Lord's side, the sword must be drawn and no natural susceptibilities must be allowed to sway the heart. The Lord said, "I have not come to send peace, but a sword" (@Matthew 10: 34).
I heard only the other day of a lady who had been turned adrift by her husband and children, simply because she would not acquiesce in that which would be dishonouring to the Lord. It is a deep reality, beloved friends; we are to be tested. If we profess to be out and out for the Lord, sooner or later the test will come. May we have purpose of heart at such a time. But we are not always killing our brethren; the great thing is uncompromising fidelity to the Lord and decision for Himself. The effect is, "Thy Thummim and thy Urim are for thy godly one". The Urim and Thummim were that by which God made known His mind. If you are swayed by natural influences you cannot have the knowledge of His mind.
The second thing is, "They shall teach Jacob thine ordinances, and Israel thy law". They become a real help to God's people in the knowledge of His mind. It is lamentable to think that out of the vast number of Christians today how few there are able to help their brethren in the knowledge of their Lord's mind! Then, "They shall put incense before thy nostrils, And whole burnt-offering upon thine altar". A people like that was a pleasure to God, to come near to Him. Is it not something to covet? Nothing could be such an attractive object to the devoted heart than to think that my going to Him is a positive pleasure to Him!
May we better understand what God's thought is -- He wants a people for Himself for His own pleasure.
{174}
BEING SUSTAINED BY WHAT IS HEAVENLY
@Numbers 15: 1 - 21
C.A.C. My thought in suggesting this scripture was to get help from the Lord as to the way He would *sustain us in the wilderness* by giving us the light of all that is heavenly.
This section of the book of Numbers is one which is typical of the assembly as found in wilderness conditions; that is, conditions of weakness, failure and rebellion, and all the things that actually come out in the people of God in the present state of things -- unbelief getting in among the people of God. In the chapters before, the spies had gone up and brought an evil report; God has sentenced the previous generation to perish in the wilderness, but He has got a Caleb. It was in Caleb's heart to cherish what was of God. There is a bit of Caleb in every believer. It is a comfort to know that God has put the light of His purpose in the hearts of His people; that is, the Spirit works in their hearts. Caleb had the land in his heart; he did not judge the land according to what he saw, but according to what was in his heart. J.B.S. used to tell us that God gives the light of the finish at the beginning. The soul that gets the Spirit gets the consciousness of the love of God; there is a consciousness -- it may not last more than five minutes -- that God wants me, He wants to set His love on me; that in the heart makes me a Caleb. You find in the previous chapter there is a generation who will go in. God's says, "Your little ones, of whom ye said they should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land that ye have despised" (chapter 14: 31). Your children shall feed in the wilderness forty years (verse 33); there is a generation represented by the children, nurtured and disciplined in the wilderness in view of the absolute certainty of their coming into
{175}
the land. That is the position taken by those in whose hearts God has put the sense of His love, and the fellowship of His purpose of their coming into the land.
Rem. I had not noticed the gift of the Spirit came so early in their course.
C.A.C. The soul that has come into it and has the Spirit has the consciousness that God has taken us up for the pleasure of His love; it may not last long, but you have it. In @Exodus 15 they speak in the past tense; they did not put their foot on the land for forty years. God's salvation covers everything; no one has the completeness of God's salvation until they reach the land. We are being nourished in the wilderness, that is our side. It says in @Acts 13: 18, "He nursed them in the desert". He is feeding us with the ministry of Christ and giving us a constitution. Then there is discipline -- was it not discipline for Caleb to wander for forty years in the wilderness! They learn all that is of the first man has to be disciplined; there are so many things that have to be brought down if God is going to put us into the land of His purpose. He says, "When ye come into the land of your *dwellings*". It is @Ephesians 2: 6, "Made us *sit* down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus". God gives the light of it to encourage them. He gives us the light of it to be a comfort and cheer and present joy in our souls. He says, 'When you come into the land, you will want to bring burnt-offerings'; there is an increasing appreciation of Christ; it begins with a lamb and goes on to a ram, and then a bullock. That belongs to the heavenly side of the Christian's experience; there is an enlarging and increasing appreciation of Christ as the ground and measure of our acceptance with God. It is different in Leviticus; there it is God speaking from His own side: we get the greatest first, and in great grace He comes down to the smallest. Here it is the ground of acceptance; that is, you think of Christ in His complete devotion in regard to sin and death. I fear a great many have not the complete joy of acceptance. When you come to the burnt-offering, it is not a
{176}
once-for-all thing; if people do not continue to bring their burnt-offering, they lose the joy of acceptance. I do not say they lose the light of it, but they lose the joy.
Rem. In each of the offerings, the wine is the same proportion.
C.A.C. That is very important; as we increase in the consciousness of acceptance in the burnt-offering, there must be the corresponding increase of our appreciation of the character of the walk and the Spirit of Christ, and as we are increasing in that we become delightful to God.
Ques. Does the wine correspond to that?
C.A.C. I think the wine is most blessed. In every case the offerer is identified with his offering; my spirit is identified with my appreciation of the self-sacrificing love of Christ; the conscious joy of acceptance marks me. How wonderful to be with God consciously identified with the sweet odour of Christ! As the consciousness of acceptance increases by the constant renewal of the burnt-offering, it is renewed on every fresh occasion when you come to God. I sometimes ask people, what do you pray about? 'Oh, I pray about trials and difficulties, the people of God, and that I may get on and be here for God'. Suppose you start on a new tack! Go to God and speak to Him about Christ; I think it would transform your spiritual life. As you speak to God about His delight in Christ, it becomes real in your soul and you get the joy of it. I believe the people of God today are a joyless people. They do not bring their burnt-offering, they are not in the joy of acceptance.
Ques. You are taking the complete view of the death of Christ; it is what secures personal acceptance, that is how I am with God. That preciousness is in His life as well as in His death?
C.A.C. I should discern between the burnt-offering, the meat-offering, and the drink-offering; that is, in proportion as we enjoy the burnt-offering, we are able to appreciate the joy God had in His life here. I shall abide in Him, and walk as He walked. It is a wonderful thing to have Christ as the
{177}
meat-offering before your soul; every perfection is there, and our souls learn to contemplate every moral perfection in Christ. Your idea of what is a spiritual person you have learned from Christ: everything about Him is spiritual; that is the only way I get a right idea of a spiritual person. You connect it all with Christ; there is no evil, no blemish, no defect.
Ques. No disproportion?
C.A.C. No, there is not a single defect; there is every feature of moral excellence in Christ; you get a sense of that, and it marks out your path; you take your path according to that. The psalmist says, 'Prepare our hearts to keep Thy precepts, that we should walk in them' (cf. @Ephesians 2: 10). Where? In Jesus. All is prepared there, that is the life in which we are to walk, that would give the heavenly character while we are still in wilderness conditions, wilderness circumstances. When you come to the drink-offering it suggests the delight of Christ, His great delight in being poured out for God and for saints. He could say, "To do thy good pleasure is my delight" (@Psalm 40: 8). That is the drink-offering. His delights were with the sons of men (@Proverbs 8: 31). "In them is all my delight" (@Psalm 16: 3). It was a positive delight to the Lord. We take character from what we bring to God.
Rem. Mr. Darby puts it, 'In this Thy nature grow'.
C.A.C. Yes,
<blockquote>'And thus Thy deep perfections <br>Much better should I know, <br>And with adoring fervour <br>In this Thy nature grow'. (`51:5)</blockquote>
There is no other way but by getting at them in Christ. I must study Christ if I want to know what moral perfection is; the power of God is in that; it works through the affections.
Ques. When does it come out?
C.A.C. Oh! it comes out when it is there; it is the light of what is proper to the land brought to us in the wilderness to be the stay and joy of faith while we are still in the wilderness conditions.
{178}
Ques. Does John give the thought when he says, "We have contemplated his glory"?
C.A.C. I think it would undoubtedly come out there, but it would come out in the whole life of the saint; you can have the light of acceptance in your private walk with God. As the deep perfections of Christ are known they give character to the saint.
Ques. I suppose when we come together what we have individually would come out?
C.A.C. It comes out in the way of service to God undoubtedly.
Ques. Would this constitute the testimony? It is the wilderness in question.
C.A.C. It is the light of what is heavenly coming out in the saint; the life of Jesus was always poured out in the service of love; every feature of His life was delightful to God. You see the real joy of it in Paul. We grow in the appreciation of it; it is a growing thing. If we had it 'once for all' it would wane; if we do not get it renewed it wanes.
Ques. Would that be leaving first love?
C.A.C. The natural tendency is to decline, but as we increase we take character from it; it all goes together -- you get a wonderful result: a people identified with God's purpose, bound up with all that Christ is; it is the greatest possible delight to think that it is so.
Rem. There is need of abstraction from things here; you do not get it in a crowd.
C.A.C. No, all this is properly heavenly and brings us to love the support of faith in the wilderness. I should think Caleb found very great joy from this chapter, and probably lived on it. It is what we have to take up individually; then you get further light. All this is laid open to the stranger: "One statute for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you" (verse 15). If Christ is brought in, He is too great for Israel; it suggests the bringing in of the Gentiles. It is God's pleasure that as many as possible shall participate in the preciousness of Christ. Then He suggests eating the bread of the
{179}
land (verse 20): "the heave-offering; as the heave-offering of the threshing-floor". This is another aspect. The bread of the land is the food of God's purpose, a risen and glorified Christ. In @John 6 Christ is the "living bread which has come down out of heaven"; "he also who eats me shall live also on account of me" (verses 51, 57). Then God says, 'When you come to that you must think of Me first'; that is, to get the nourishing power we have to think first of God's delight to have Him there; if we do not start with that we shall not get the nourishing power in our souls. That refers to the wave sheaf of @Leviticus 23. The wave sheaf is the soul taking its place with God in the sense of God's delight to have Christ in reserve. Satan never made a greater mistake from his point of view than when he incited man to put Christ to death, because it necessitated resurrection, and so as to the bread of the land God has the first joy, and we have to realise God's portion, the delight of God to have Man in the Person of the Lord Jesus. God says, 'Now think first of My point in it'.
Ques. Is that the secret of true deliverance?
C.A.C. It is that we should think of Christ in relation to God.
Ques. "In that he lives, he lives to God". God has come into the vision of his soul?
C.A.C. Yes; in the end of @Romans 7 I used to wish he would explain a little more how it was done; he seems to get all tied up in a knot, and then he exclaims suddenly, "I thank God". That is how it happened; he gets God before him and he himself is nowhere. It is sonship in @Ephesians 2. It was all with the risen and glorified Man in view. There is His place officially in the moral universe, but first of all you have something Godward. If God is going to have sons before Him, He has secured it in Christ. Think what it was to God when sin came in! What a grief to His heart. Now God has a Man who is equal to put sin away. What a delight to God to have One like that! In the end of the gospels it is the inherent power that is in Christ that was before the writers minds so that they do not say, 'He was raised', they say "He is risen". It is
{180}
His glory. God has Him in ascension and resurrection, so God can say, 'Now before you get the nourishing power of it, think first what it is to Me'; that brings you to what is properly heavenly, while we are still in wilderness conditions being disciplined; but God brings in the nourishing light of all this for the support of faith in circumstances of all kinds. It is a fine chapter. Nothing else will make us heavenly in our spirits. God is ever ministering Christ to us, so that there is a power to effect everything that is for God's delight in us. We cannot improve upon God's way of working.
THE RED HEIFER
@Numbers 19: 1 - 22
The red heifer is quite a new type. It brings out a new aspect of Christ in His death. We feel that the chapters in this section are very important in bringing out priestly grace in which God goes on with His people in the wilderness in view of bringing them into the land, and in a certain sense it is an abnormal aspect of priesthood in conditions of murmuring and rebellion and the iniquity of the sanctuary. It exists, but on what footing does God deal with these elements which are unsuitable to Him? How does He provide for their being adjusted? We may all be conscious that these elements are found among Christians, but how is God acting in reference to them? Seeing what we are, these elements are there. It must have been very difficult to avoid defilement and not to come in contact with something which is the element of death; that is, sin, which is the cause of it. (The mind of the flesh is death, @Romans 8: 6). It is not at all difficult to come in contact with the mind of the flesh, seeing we are in mixed conditions. To be influenced by it is defilement. It is not only personal defilement but "Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth
{181}
the tabernacle of Jehovah" (verse 13). That is the serious part of it: the question of the tabernacle of Jehovah -- God dwelling amongst His people. The nearer you get to God, the more you come under His scrutiny. (A man does not take account of boys in the street, but does of his own children.) It becomes the occasion of the opening up to us of the death of Christ. The point is, it will all be met in grace -- grace provides the purifying. (It does not say that the man who defiles himself will be cut off.) The thought of advocacy comes in here. It is very important to see that there is the provision, and that the means of purifying should be really present with the saints, so that there has not to be a great fuss made when the need arises; it is at hand and we know how to use it. This chapter is a fine instruction. Defiling the tabernacle is giving place to the mind of the flesh; we bring in something defiling which affects every saint on earth -- it is a moral stain on the tabernacle of the Lord. It affects *all*. None can say, 'That is my look-out', for it is the look-out of all the saints. It is defiled if a man gets defiled and does not get purified. It should never get to the point of being defiled. All this priestly activity is seen in the rebellion subdued, murmuring silenced and defilement purified -- all in priestly grace. If we are not working on the line of priestly grace, we are not working with God. There is nothing so righteous and holy as the grace of God. There is no condoning the sin. Every one that touches the heifer or her ashes is unclean. God shows us what a serious thing it is to have to do with sin.
A heifer -- the female, in type -- refers to state. Christ is presented in connection with that wonderful sacrifice in which the state is taken into account: the *man*, not his *actions*; what the flesh is, not what it *does*. "The mind (not the acts or words) of the flesh is death". Too much prudence or too much self-respect is the *mind* of the flesh. Acts reveal but the mind does not. Things are allowed inside that are defiling. It applies to the thoughts and motives (hidden like the bones); I may be careful not to show these. Pull yourself up and say, 'This is a bit of what Christ died for'. We can run
{182}
through the seven days (verses 12, 19) in seven seconds. It is an uncommon description of the offerings. As a rule they were to be without blemish, but here
<ol>
<li>without blemish, </li>
<li>no defect, </li>
<li>upon which never came yoke. </li>
</ol>
A wonderful unfolding of the perfections of Christ.
1. *Without blemish*. The perfect contrast with all that flesh is.
That helps us, but denouncing the flesh does not. Nothing displaces the power of the flesh but Christ. Study Him in every part of His moral glory and you find no blemish. Pilate found no fault with this Man. The dying thief said He had done nothing amiss. The Holy Spirit said He had no guile, and He Himself said, "Which of you convinces me of sin?" There was *no* flaw.
2. *No defect*. Have you ever considered that? Everything there was positively delightful to God. Not a single element of good was absent. If you think of everything that ought to be, you will find it all in Christ. The more you study Christ the more you wonder at Him. You can dispense with man after the flesh when you have a Man without defect.
3. *Upon which never came yoke*. He never came in servitude -- to any of the principles of this world. The most spiritual men come sometimes under a yoke but the Lord never did. He was never moved by the desire to please men, nor influenced by the hopes and fears of His disciples. He would have been brought under wrong influence if He had yielded. We have no idea how soon we are influenced! Any human influence is a yoke. Natural relationships are one of the strongest yokes. The Lord would not allow His mother to put a yoke on His neck. As you get Him before you, it takes you quite away from the mind of the flesh. It is just the opposite of what you learn in Christ.
"Red" is the distinctiveness of Christ.
I hope we all aspire to be Eleazars! He is an important type of priesthood (not of Christ, as he gets defiled). It is a
{183}
type of the priestly spirit of Christ in the saints. It is in accord with Christ, because it is His spirit. It does not die in the wilderness.
Eleazar is one of Aaron's sons. 'Eleazar' means 'God is helper'. He continues in the presence of the defilement of the wilderness, goes over Jordan, and does not cease his activity until the people possess the inheritance. It sets forth *that* priestly activity. "The blood of the Christ, who by the *eternal* Spirit offered himself" (@Hebrews 9: 14). The very Spirit by which Christ offered Himself is in the saints!
Have you another Spirit? As a saint you have that same Spirit, and that Spirit living in the saints is the power of the priesthood.
The priestly spirit in the saints can take account of Christ. At the death and burning of the heifer, Eleazar is a spectator -- he takes account of Christ. One covets to be an Eleazar.
There are not two spirits. "If any man have not the Spirit of Christ" (@Romans 8: 9) -- he is no Eleazar!
{184}
{185}
READING AND ADDRESS ON DEUTERONOMY
{186}
{187}
THE INHERITANCE
@Deuteronomy 11: 10 - 15; @Deuteronomy 14: 22, 23
The Old Testament is a great help to us because it presents things in a form which, according to the wisdom of God, is divinely suited to convey the truth to us, while presenting it in a way that exercises our spiritual understanding. I have no doubt that the scriptures we have read, and indeed Deuteronomy as a whole, were written primarily for us and not for Israel. When I say primarily, I mean that we who are God's people at the present time are the first to get the good of this book. No doubt Israel will get the good of it later on in great measure, but we take precedence over them in getting the spiritual gain of it. It is the word of God to us. "For as many things as have been written before have been written for our instruction" (@Romans 15: 4).
What was before me at this time was that we might look at certain things which stand in relation to the place where Jehovah causes His name to dwell. These things represent exercises which have a result for the pleasure of God when His people are gathered together according to divine ordering. The things which I refer to at present were obligatory; no Israelite could disregard them; and neither can we disregard what they typify without disregarding the claims of divine love, and what is for our joy and the pleasure of God. The tithes might occupy us this evening, and another time, if the Lord will, we might consider the firstlings, and then the three feasts of chapter 16 -- the passover, the feast of weeks, and the feast of tabernacles. These five things represent things which are obligatory upon all saints viewed as in the inheritance of God, and in the enjoyment of its wealth.
{188}
Many things are left by God to the free affections of His people. He puts no restriction on the liberty of those affections; He gives unlimited scope to bring burnt-offerings, sacrifices, heave-offerings, vows, voluntary offerings, choice vows. See chapter 12: 6, 11. All these things can be rendered as love prompts them. But the five things I have referred to are not so left; they represent things which are essential to the service and pleasure of God, and which are not to be omitted. There is what may be called an irreducible minimum, and it becomes a definite exercise that we should not fail to render it. The tithes were to be eaten in the place where Jehovah caused His name to dwell; the firstlings were to be eaten there; and the passover and the feast of weeks and the feast of tabernacles were to be observed there. There was no exception for any Israelite; all were under obligation to respect these things; they were essential to the pleasure of God in His people. If we do not take up what answers spiritually to these things we shall fail to minister to the pleasure of God, and we shall lose much joy which God would put into our hearts.
We need not think that this is going to wear a legal aspect, or to make demands which there are no resources to meet. We shall find that in every detail it is enriching, enlarging, satisfying and joy-giving. For it is all brought about by divine love and divine giving, and it all tends to God finding satisfaction in having us before Him with our joy full. The only law that operates in the land is the perfect law of liberty; the only bondage that is known there is captivity in the chains of love. There is no Egyptian toil; all is under the sweet influence of heaven.
The people of God are viewed here as having come into the inheritance, and it is of the greatest importance that we should accustom ourselves to consider that we have our portion in the inheritance. We should all be prepared to accept that as the thought of divine love for us. We get the inheritance purely by the love and calling of God. It is well for us to
{189}
see clearly the difference between the conditions which are set forth typically in the wilderness and those which pertain to the land. The wilderness is not a place of rest; things are not very agreeable there, though we prove the resources and sufficiency of divine grace in those conditions. Viewed as in the wilderness we prove the love of God and the love of Christ; we recognise there the lordship of Christ and the presence of the Spirit, and we may enjoy a great deal of grace and blessing; we may take up the privilege there of coming together to eat the Lord's supper. But all that, great as it is, is not the full pleasure of God's love for us. He has something else in His heart for us, and that is the inheritance, something which lies entirely outside wilderness life. We get the inheritance by the gift and appointment of the One who bestows it in love upon us. No amount of desire would secure to me the inheritance of some wealthy person. I could only get it by his appointment or by being his heir. I could say to the youngest and feeblest believer that long before he was born, God had prepared the inheritance for him. We were born anew and redeemed by the precious blood of Christ that we might possess the inheritance which the love of God designed for us. It is as much in the mind and heart of God that we should receive and enjoy the inheritance as that we should receive remission of sins. Jesus glorified sent Paul to the Gentiles "that they may receive remission of sins and inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith in me" (@Acts 26: 18).
The inheritance is the fruit of the love of God. John says, "See what love the Father has given to us that we should be called the children of God". And Paul in writing to the Colossians says, "Giving thanks to the Father, who has made us fit for sharing the portion of the saints in light". That is the inheritance. It is beautiful to contemplate it as it is described in @Deuteronomy 11: 10 - 12. "A land which Jehovah thy God careth for; the eyes of Jehovah thy God are constantly upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year". There is a sphere of blessing and of joy
{190}
which is so precious to the heart of God that He cares for it, and His eyes are on it perpetually. Such is the inheritance that He has allotted to us in sovereign love. It is the full thought of divine favour for men, the wealthy places of blessing in Christ, in whom all the rich thoughts of God have been secured. The love of God ever cherishes the inheritance for us and cherishes us for the inheritance; the youngest believer is entitled to take that home to himself in all its blessedness. Persons who are heirs to a great inheritance usually think a good deal about it, but what inheritance can be compared to ours? If God cares for it, and His eyes are constantly upon it, we may well care for it, and have our eyes upon it. We are not incompetent to take it up; the Father has made us fit -- or competent -- to take it up, in the divine nature. According to Ephesians we have "obtained an inheritance, being marked out beforehand according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his own will, that we should be to the praise of his glory".
It is purely a question of God's sovereign love, and of where it has given us our portion.
It is clear that what love gives can only be taken up and enjoyed by love. The conditions on our side are an obedient ear and a heart that loves God. All the ministry in the world would not help us if we lacked these things. But one is comforted to know that saints have an ear, and they love; it is the result of the work of God in them. There is everything about the inheritance to make it supremely attractive. God would allure us; it is a matter of intense concern to Him that we should be attracted by the thought of the inheritance, that we should care for what He cares for, and that our eyes should be on the things that His eyes are upon. Israel fell because they did not hearken to the word which spoke to them of the inheritance -- the promised land. What a comfort it is to know that the children of God have an ear and a heart by the work of God; one feels comforted in speaking to the saints as counting on the work of God in them.
{191}
In Egypt they watered the seed with the foot; there was great labour with small results; that is like the religious world today, much labour but small results spiritually. What marks the land which is before God for His people is that it drinks water of the rain of heaven. God works in His people; they are begotten of Him and He works to produce an ear and a heart so that they love Him. There are persons in this world who are interested in the inheritance; the things of God take the first place with them and predominate over all natural and self interests. Wherever it is so it is by the work of God. Then God gives the early and latter rain. These are the conditions of fruitfulness in the inheritance on God's side. The early rain comes to prepare the ground, and to start the growth of crops, and the latter rain falls to bring things to maturity. If there are with us the ear and the heart which we have referred to, God will most surely give rain. He will give ministry from heaven that will promote fertility, and the maturing of the spiritual crops. I think we might see an application of this in a general way and regard the early rain as typical of the ministry of the apostles. The ministry of the apostles was like the early rain to start things, at the beginning, but we are in the days of the latter rain. God is giving a ministry now to bring His pleasure to maturity in His people; surely none of us want to miss the gain of that. There are showers of latter rain falling on the inheritance at the present time in order that every thought of God for the spiritual enrichment of His saints may be brought to maturity ere the Lord returns. The latter things with God are greater than the former, and the glory of the latter days is greater than the former. @Amos 9: 13 in referring to the latter days says, "The ploughman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed". That shows the extraordinary fruitfulness of the inheritance; the crops could be so heavy that the fields could not be cleared by the reapers before the ploughman was ready to come in and prepare for the next crop! It gives us an extraordinary impression of the fertility
{192}
of the inheritance. There is never any need, under such conditions, for the ground to lie fallow. Then why should we labour for things which do not satisfy, when we can eat in abundance what is so good, and let our souls delight themselves in fatness (@Isaiah 55)?
The wealth of the inheritance is available for us now if God has wrought in us the desire and delight to listen to what he has to say about it. The Lord said, "He that has an ear, let him hear" -- He assumed that there would be persons who had an ear. It is true of all the holy and faithful brethren in Christ that there is early and latter rain for them. God gives every one of us some early rain; He gives a ministry which was designed to work out in divine faithfulness; and as we exercise spiritual diligence the crops spring up and will come to maturity under the influence of the latter rain. But a spiritual diligence is most important. Turn to chapter 12: 7.
"Ye shall eat there before Jehovah your God, and ye shall rejoice in all business of your hand" and in verse 18 "Thou shalt rejoice before Jehovah thy God in all the business of thy hand". The phrase recurs repeatedly in these chapters -- "All the business of thy hand". I would suggest that it implies diligence in the appreciation and cultivation of the inheritance. It is to be our definite business to see to the working out in result for our own joy of that which God gives us. So far as I can learn in Scripture, God has nothing for lazy people, and there is nothing for God from them. Many quietly accept that the inheritance is given to them in the love of God, and they perhaps know what it is to be under showers of blessing in the way of ministry, but they are indolent and slothful, they are not carrying out diligently what Scripture calls "the business of your hand". It is through the business of our hand that the inheritance becomes fruitful. There will be no crops, no corn or new wine, or oil, apart from diligence, and the result will be that there will be no tithes. We fail from want of spiritual diligence in regard to the things we admit to be true.
{193}
The latter glory of the house will be greater than the former.
In @Romans 12 we are incited to diligence. "As to diligent zealousness, not slothful; in spirit fervent, serving the Lord". This is of the greatest importance in view of its effect on the meetings; the end in view is that there may be something brought to the meetings which will be an enrichment of the communion of the brethren. This is the product of diligence in cultivating the land. If we accept that divine love has given us the inheritance let us cultivate it with purpose of heart. In so doing we shall be working for an assured result; there is no question about God giving the increase. There will be crops in abundance, and tithes to carry to the place where God causes His name to dwell; to be eaten there in communion with the brethren before Him. Let us throw ourselves into this "business" with whole-hearted energy and confidence; the product of it is very attractive.
Our secular occupation in this world is discipline for us; it is a constant exercise to carry out the will of God in relation to it. But it is not our true "business" in a spiritual sense; it is discipline for us; but our "business" is to cultivate the inheritance. I have noticed that people who are pretty fully engaged in necessary duties prosper most spiritually; those who have little to do and much leisure often do not prosper because they lack the discipline of daily duties. The discipline we get in everyday life is intended to help us in view of our appreciating and entering upon and cultivating the inheritance. A brother was asked not long ago why he did not retire. He said, I feel I cannot afford to dispense with the discipline my business is to me. We are not here to make money but to be disciplined, and the circumstances of daily life as under the ordering of God will not hinder us in regard to the inheritance. It would be strange if the providential ordering of God for those in His kingdom was such as to hinder us from enjoying the things which it is His peculiar pleasure to confer upon us. It could never be so. We are hindered by
{194}
seeking our own things, not by things which lie in the will of God for us.
The things spoken of here lie outside the wilderness life -- the corn, the new wine and the oil of the land are the wealth and fatness of the inheritance. We have not time to go into them in detail, but I should like everyone to pray about them. The *corn*, I believe, represents Christ risen as the great expression of divine faithfulness. Every ear of corn came out of death; it speaks of Christ in resurrection as the great expression of divine faithfulness -- every promise of God made good in Him. That is the food of the saints as in the land. @Psalm 37 says, "Dwell in the land, and feed on faithfulness"; that is the corn of the land, it is the bread that strengthens man's heart. It is the faithfulness of God to His own promises. There is not one word that God ever committed Himself to in the promises that He has not secured in Christ risen; the sure mercies of David are there; that is the food of the land. It is what Paul refers to in @2 Corinthians 1, "God is faithful, that our word to you is not yea and nay ... in him is the yea, and in him the amen, for glory to God by us". That is outside wilderness life; it is the corn of the land. We are to gather it into our spiritual store and feed on it.
The *new wine* is typical of the joy that belongs to the kingdom of God. That, too, has its place beyond the reach of death, for the Lord had death before Him here, but He looked beyond to drinking of the fruit of the vine in the kingdom. I have no doubt it is figurative of the joy which is connected with the favour of God being fully known. Grace is a joy to the heart of God. We read that new wine "cheers God and man" (@Judges 9: 13). The Lord Jesus gives us a taste of the joy of God in grace, and of His own joy in making it known, in @Luke 15. The kingdom of God is where he has His own way in the perfect grace of His heart, and where men are brought under the sway of His grace. In "the land" there is a continual fresh gathering in of the joy of grace. Grace as known in "the land" is spoken of in Ephesians. "To the praise of the glory of his grace" (chapter l: 6); "the riches of
{195}
his grace" (chapter l: 7); and "the surpassing riches of his grace in kindness towards us in Christ Jesus" (chapter 2: 7). Then the oil speaks of the peculiar richness of what is found in the Spirit. "Fatness" is connected with the olive in both the Old Testament and the New. "Let your soul delight itself in fatness" is, I have no doubt, an allusion to what lies in the Spirit. The "root" of the olive tree (@Romans 11) would be faith in Abraham which counted on God, but the "fatness" of it lies in the Spirit. So we find that the blessing of Abraham has come to us in Christ Jesus that we might receive "the promise of the Spirit through faith" (@Galatians 3: 14). Everything taken up in the Spirit has peculiar richness; it makes man's face to shine (@Psalm 104: 15). "Thy corn, and thy new wine, and thine oil", convey to us that as in the inheritance, and as making the cultivation, under the blessing of God, the business of our hand, there will be always fresh crops coming in as "the produce of the field, year by year". Things never become stale; there is continual freshness about every new crop. It is not that the produce is of a different kind; we do not want novelties; *they* are noxious weeds. But while there is no change in the character of it, it is still corn, new wine and oil -- it is being continually acquired in a fresh way. There is fresh produce being gathered in -- continual increase.
Corn, new wine and oil represent things which we are continually gathering in by the work of our hands as in the inheritance. But as we gather them in we have always to remember to tithe them, and the tithe has to be carried to the place where God causes His name to dwell. Every spiritual increase has to be linked with the assembly -- the common meeting place of God's people. What one gains individually or householdwise is always to contribute to the communion found where God dwells in the midst of His people. The tithes had to be eaten there.
It is not in this case ministering directly to God, but ministering to the communion of His saints before Him. It is most agreeable to God that we should come before Him to enjoy
{196}
together in communion that which He has given to us as the food and fatness of the inheritance. How the practical working out of this would free the meetings of the saints from all formality! Since we last came together there has been, so to speak, a fresh harvest from our fields, a fresh vintage, and a fresh gathering in of oil throughout Israel. And each one comes with the tithe that we may all eat together before God in the place where He dwells. All is fresh -- the same Christ, the same grace, the same Spirit, but all acquired in a new way through fresh diligence and living exercises. So that the tithe is something which was never eaten quite in the same way before. The communion of the saints as gathered together has thus continually a fresh and satisfying character. There is nothing old or stale. The communion is such as to suit a living God, and a people who are living in the good of what He has given. It is the communion of saints viewed, not in the Corinthian aspect as in the wilderness, but as in the land. It is our communion viewed as in the enjoyment together of eternal life.
God delights in the spiritual communion of His people before Him -- their common enjoyment of things which lie outside the range and power of death. Are we bringing the tithes to further this? Have we got increase as the result of diligent cultivation of the land so that we have something to tithe, something which we can bring to the gathering place of God's people to promote spiritual communion? I am not only referring to what is said in the meetings, though I have no doubt if spiritual substance is there it will find expression. But I challenge myself and you as to whether we are acquiring spiritual increase. There is something very abnormal if we are not. But if we are, it is obligatory to tithe it for the promotion of the communion of the saints. The communion of saints in eating together what is typified by the corn, the new wine and the oil of the land is eternal life.
The communion of saints viewed as in the land depends on moral conditions being maintained which are suitable to the
{197}
place where God dwells, and it depends upon the tithes being brought. Independency, and what is right in our own eyes, are ruled out. All must come to the one appointed place. It is not a matter of choice, but of God's appointment. If it is not carried out the service of God according to His pleasure is not rendered.
Sometimes brethren who are not getting on well together will be heard saying wonderful things in their utterances. But God is saying by this institution of tithes that He gives spiritual increase to promote spiritual communion. It is more to Him to see us united in the communion before Him of what He has given us, than it is to hear wonderful words from us while the communion is lacking.
It is very much for the pleasure of God that we should know the fellowship of saints as in the wilderness according to 1 Corinthians, but if we desire to minister to God's full pleasure it must be by enjoying the fellowship which pertains to the inheritance -- to that sphere where eternal life and sonship are entered into.
GOD'S PROPHET
@Deuteronomy 18: 9 - 22
God's Prophet is introduced in this chapter in contrast with all the abominations which have come in through men listening to communications from beneath. The eight things mentioned in verses 10 and 11 refer to communications from the unseen world. There are many avenues through which Satan influences men. All these things are coming in again under new names, and people hearken to them, but they are all opposed to God. "Thou shalt be perfect with Jehovah thy God" (verse 13), means that we are not to listen for a moment to any communication which is not from Him.
{198}
God ever had before Him to communicate with men. He spoke to Adam and Eve in innocence (@Genesis 1: 28 - 30), and afterwards they "heard the voice of Jehovah Elohim, walking in the garden in the cool of the day" (@Genesis 3: 8). It was His pleasure to be near to man and to communicate with Him, and it grieved God to find that distrust and distance had come in on man's part. Another communication had been listened to, a communication from beneath. Every abomination has come in that way, but deliverance is found in listening to God's Prophet. "In the beginning was the Word"
(@John 1: 1), is a statement which tells us plainly that from the beginning God had in mind to speak to men, but the serpent has been speaking also, so that there are two kinds of speaking, as we see -- the first in @Deuteronomy 18: 10 - 14, the second in verses 15 - 19. Men have opened their ears to communications from the power of darkness, but it is blessed to know that God has not left men without communications from Himself. Man is God's intelligent creature, and God speaks to him intelligibly. All the darkening influences in the world have come from beneath, but all illuminating influences are from above, they come down from "the Father of lights".
Divination, auguries, enchantments, sorcery, charms, a spirit of Python, soothsaying, consulting the dead, are all found today in christendom, but they neither convict men of sin, nor give the knowledge of salvation by the remission of sins. They darken men as to the true knowledge of God. The communications which come from God are not dark and mysterious; they are light, and they make known that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all, and that He is now in light as having fully revealed Himself in a Man, His own beloved Son.
Moses said, "Jehovah thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee ... like unto me". That this refers directly to Christ is proved by Peter's quotation of it in @Acts 3. It declares unmistakably the true humanity of Him whom God has sent, and who has spoken the words of God.
{199}
The full communication of God's words, of all that He would have made known to men, has come in One who is truly Man. The One "who is over all, God blessed for ever" came of Israel as according to flesh (@Romans 9: 5).
God has come near to men, and put Himself into communication with them, by Christ. To receive His communications is the greatest privilege and favour. It means that God is known, and if He is known, He is loved, and if He is loved, He is worshipped.
Christ was like unto Moses as being the true Deliverer and Mediator. He inaugurated in grace and truth all that was typically set forth in Moses. The covenant, the service of God, and all that is suitable to the inheritance, were made known by Moses, and Christ is like unto him in relation to all these blessed things, giving the fulness of them according to all that is in the mind of God. What a Prophet we have! "Unto him shall ye hearken".
This was in the minds of the disciples, and it was in the light of it that they hearkened to Jesus. As the Prophet, God's words were in the mouth of Christ, and He spoke what God commanded Him to speak. Hence He could say, "My doctrine is not mine, but that of him that has sent me" (@John 7: 16). And again, "the words (the divine communications) which thou hast given me, I have given them, and they have received them, and have known truly that I came out from thee, and have believed that thou sentest me" (@John 17: 8). The One who was raised up "of thy brethren" so near to men as being truly Man, was "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father"; it was He who "came down out of heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven" (@John 1: 18; @John 3: 13). He was therefore able to declare God in a way of unmeasured fulness, and to speak of heavenly things as knowing them and having seen them. All has been told out now; there is no reserve in the divine communications; "All things which I have heard of my Father I have made known to you" (@John 15: 15).
Not everything that the Lord said and did has been
{200}
recorded in the Scriptures. The gospels are a divine selection by the Holy Spirit, and they are fully adequate to set forth all that was spoken by the Son of God when here. His works spoke volumes as well as His words. Every utterance of the Lord has a fulness which is immeasurable. There are some verses of which Christians have been speaking and writing for nearly two thousand years, and fresh beauties and glories are being disclosed in them every day. The Holy Scriptures are the greatest marvel in the world, and the gospels are the greatest marvel of the Scriptures. The four gospels are a little book, which could be read in a day, but there is concentrated there what will fill eternity with its blessedness. John supposes that if all the things which Jesus did were written one by one, "not even the world itself would contain the books written". If men had written these narratives in their own ability they would never have known when to stop. But the Holy Spirit has given all that was necessary for us in words marked by simplicity and dignity. As we read we are in the presence of the ineffable majesty, and yet infinite grace, of *the Word*. There is fulness of divine communication, constraining the soul to worship as it is realised that God has made known in His beloved Son all that was in His heart and mind manward.
The assembly of God is to be characterised by speaking which is of God as to its origin and its power. See @1 Corinthians 14. The speaking there is to take character from Christ's speaking; indeed, He is now speaking from heaven in the power of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit speaks in the house of God, bringing out in detail what God has communicated by Christ, and giving it application to the needs of souls and of the assembly. Such prophetic speaking has peculiar value in a day of departure, as reviving in spiritual power that which was from the beginning, and exposing the departure by bringing out the mind of God as it was originally made known. The assembly is God's house; it is the pillar and base of the truth, and the way to speak in it is "as oracles of God"
{201}
(@1 Peter 4: 11). Such speaking would be the speaking of Christ continued in intelligent communications from God. Not new revelations, but every word in accord with what God has spoken by Christ. In presence of difficulties the prophetic word would exercise consciences so that the moral state might be put right. Whatever matter occasions difficulty the real question is the moral state of saints, and if this is judged in the light of communications from God, difficulties melt away.
I "will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him". Nothing is held in reserve now, save judgment. The Spirit has come in witness to the fact that all the mind of God is out; there is nothing further to be looked for. "As for you let that which ye have heard from the beginning abide in you: if what ye have heard from the beginning abides in you, *ye* also shall abide in the Son and in the Father". There can be no advance upon this; any going forward from it must be apostasy (@2 John 9).
It is a serious thing not to hearken to Christ. "And it shall come to pass that the man who hearkeneth not unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him" (@Deuteronomy 18: 19).
The word from the excellent glory is "Hear him".

MINISTRY ON JOSHUA
{204}
{205}
FROM C.A.C.S NOTES
@Joshua 1: 1 - 18
The word to Joshua was "Rise up, go over this Jordan, thou and all this people, into the land which I give unto them" (@Joshua 1: 2). Going over Jordan does not represent our natural death and going to heaven, as is sometimes thought, but it typifies a spiritual movement. The disciples in the days of Christ's flesh had the faith of Him as in that condition, but when He was raised from among the dead they had the faith of Him as in a new condition in which no man had ever been before. In Him death was annulled and life and incorruptibility brought to light. This is a blessed reality and actuality in Christ. But we cannot read the epistle to the Colossians without seeing that it is the thought of God for us that we should know what it is to be dead with Christ and raised with Him. This truth was brought out for the assembly in Paul. No other company, so far as I know, will ever pass over the Jordan so as to be in faith and spirit risen with Christ. So that the opening chapters of Joshua are of chief importance to us as bringing out in a typical way how we come to the apprehension of what is in God's mind for us.
Joshua represents the spiritual lead which God furnishes for His people in view of them entering into his purposes as set forth in Christ risen and ascended. This requires that heed should be taken to all the law which had been given. We should not expect to get light or leading with respect to being risen with Christ from those who disregard the Lord's commandments with reference to the presence of the Spirit and assembly order as seen in 1 Corinthians. And this has become largely the case in the christian profession. Hence few know what it is to "go over this Jordan". But spiritual
{206}
leading was present in the apostles, particularly in Paul, and we can say thankfully that revived attention has been drawn to it in these last days. It is now for us to see that we move with the lead that is given us. This book is intended to greatly help us in doing so.
We must first come into line in our minds with what is before God for us. This is indicated in the command to "Prepare yourselves victuals" (verse 11). We are here regarded as having intelligence as to what is in God's mind for us, and also as understanding the kind of food that will nourish us inwardly in view of passing over. This food would be what Paul speaks of as "meat" and "solid food". Something more than light is needed; there must be spiritual vigour derived from suitable food. We must be inwardly nourished in a way which corresponds with the position of being risen with Christ. For it is not merely a question of receiving directions but of assembly movement for which there must be inward strength through feeding. And we are viewed here as being able to prepare that food for ourselves.
The saints as "according to Spirit" and minding "the things of the Spirit" (@Romans 8: 5) are capable of preparing food which will enable them to enter upon the portion set forth in the Colossian epistle. It is an intelligent concern of spiritual persons who realise that they not only need manna for the wilderness but they need suitable food in the strength of which they can pass over Jordan. Many believers have not taken up this exercise, but it is set before us typically in the Scriptures that we may take it up. Have our reading, meditation and prayers any reference to passing over Jordan? Do we feel the need of inward support for this assembly movement? We are clearly, according to this type, to prepare ourselves for it and to see that we have "victuals" in the strength of which we can pass over. We are to have before us the promises of God, and we are to be exercised that what we feed upon will strengthen us and build up our spiritual constitution for an order of things which is altogether outside the life of this world. We are to "prepare" such food for ourselves,
{207}
not looking that others will do it for us. The substance of it will be Christ as the One with whom we are identified in the mind of God. We feed on Him as the One who determines what our place is, and where our life is, according to divine thoughts. If He is not inwardly formed in our affections there will be no strength to proceed over Jordan. Many delight in Him as their Saviour who have never entertained the thought of being identified with Him in death and in life beyond death, and yet this was brought clearly into view in our baptism, which as referred to in @Romans 6 is, in figure, burial with Christ, but in @Colossians 2 we see that it also carries with it the thought of our being raised with Him. Every baptised person must admit that this was God's thought for him, but in preparing victuals the people of God act intelligently to prepare themselves inwardly to take it up in spiritual reality. There is need for being built up in Christ so as to have ability and constitution to "pass over this Jordan". It is for us to prepare ourselves food which will enable us to pass over. It is well to ask if we know what this means? Have we really provided ourselves with this kind of spiritual food? Are we intelligent as to it? We cannot pass over Jordan unless there is with us some *inward* correspondence with the movement, brought about by feeding.
It is said of Christ that He was "put to death in flesh, but made alive in the Spirit" (@1 Peter 3: 18). We must seek to apprehend Him as alive out of death, having forever left the condition of flesh and blood and now in a condition in which man never was before, and which is the evidence of the complete disannulling of death and the bringing to light of life and incorruptibility. He is to be apprehended spiritually as in that condition, and we are to understand that as in that condition He is food for us, in view of our passing over spiritually as dead and risen with Him into what God had purposed for us. And it is not simply that He is food for us, but we understand as taught of God how to *prepare* the food. We can set it in an ordered way before us as God's mind for us. It is of great importance that believers should have ability to
{208}
do this. We must use the "three days" rightly in preparing victuals, or we shall not have strength or constitution to pass over.
RAHAB'S FAITH AND HER WORKS
@Joshua 2: 1 - 24
This chapter is of great importance as coming at the commencement of the book of Joshua. It would intimate to us that if we are to possess and enjoy the land, we must have Rahab's faith and Rahab's works. It is a particularly interesting chapter to us because it shows how the Gentile comes into divine blessing. I remember Mr. Stoney saying many years ago that one proof to him that Paul wrote the epistle to the Hebrews was that when recounting the acts of faith the writer stops when he comes to Rahab the harlot; when he has got the Gentile into the land he has reached the climax of the actings of faith.
Before we get any of the triumphs of Joshua and the army of Jehovah, we get a moral triumph which is greater than any of the military triumphs -- the victory of divine grace in the soul of Rahab. And her household is typically the household of faith.
We see here a marvellous working of God in the place where the enemy was strongest, for Jericho would represent that; and Rahab's house was in the strongest part of Jericho; it was on the wall. It is remarkable that the first activity of God in the land was not one of destruction but of blessing.
The iniquity of the Amorites was indeed full, and the divine sentence for their destruction had gone forth. But the first movement was a movement of grace in the heart of one who was certainly not one of the best of the guilty and condemned race. The New Testament speaks of her as "Rahab the harlot" (@Hebrews 11 and @James 2) to magnify the grace which did not
{209}
suffer her to perish along with the unbelieving, and which caused her to be justified by works. Hebrews calls attention to her faith and James to her works. God so wrought in Rahab that she became the most distinguished "mother in Israel" of her day.
It is interesting to note that the spies did nothing else, as far as the record goes, but take knowledge of the work of God in Rahab. They did not take knowledge of the strength of the enemy, but of the mighty power of God that could work in the strongest part of the enemy's territory and secure such a triumph for Himself.
We read in @Hebrews 11 that Rahab received the spies with peace. It must have been an astonishment to the spies to find a person in Jericho to receive them with peace. The fact was that Jehovah had become her God; their God was her God unquestionably. She was the one person in Jericho who had a divine outlook on the situation; and when the spies got back to Joshua they reported Rahab's outlook on the situation. (Compare verse 24 with verses 9 - 11.) Rahab's faith is connected with how she received the spies, and her works are connected with how she dismissed them. We have to learn these two lessons spiritually if we are to estimate the present situation aright.
The spies, or messengers, represent the twofold character of the mission of the Spirit. @Hebrews 11 calls them spies, and @James 2 calls them messengers. The Spirit of God has come in that twofold character. He is a spy to search out and expose all the power of evil in this world. "And having come, he will bring demonstration to the world, of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: of sin, because they do not believe on me; of righteousness, because I go away to my Father, and ye behold me no longer; of judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged" (@John 16: 8 - 12). That is the Spirit in the spy character; He searches out and exposes all the condition of the world in its opposition to God, in its Jericho character. On the other hand He is a messenger; He brings a message of blessing to all those who fear God.
{210}
These two men were spies in relation to Jericho, but messengers in relation to Rahab, divine messengers of grace and blessing. They "came into a harlot's house, named Rahab". They came to her, and as spies she received them with peace. Rahab was in accord with the judgment that God had passed on the people to whom she had belonged; she was in harmony with God and His people about it all; so she received the spies with peace. God can bring that about in presence of all the power of Satan and the world. He can bring a soul into harmony with His Spirit's judgment of all that is in the world; He can do it in the sovereignty of His mercy. There is a great deal involved in it.
Rahab could speak of what God had done at the Red Sea, and then of the overthrow of Sihon and Og (see verse 10). She understood typically what God had done through the death and resurrection of Christ for His people, as seen in the Red Sea. And she understood what he was doing in the power of the Spirit in His people in overthrowing the flesh. She had a spiritual estimate of it all, and she says, 'That God shall be my God; that people shall be my people; I will link myself with them; I no longer belong to Jericho or to Jericho's king, I belong to Jehovah and to His people'. She "received the spies with peace".
God would bear testimony to Himself in this remarkable way. He would glorify Himself in the sovereignty of His mercy at the very moment when He was about to judge. He would teach Israel that it was not their superiority that gave them title to the land, but His sovereign call and blessing. Just on the same principle as He had called Abraham, He called Rahab, and therefore we can understand James putting the two together: Abraham the vessel of promise in all his dignity as the great father, and then Rahab, a poor Canaanitish harlot, both the subjects of the same sovereign calling and the same divine working. How different the vessels! But the same treasure put in each! It is faith that distinguishes a person with God; not the vessel, but what God is pleased to put in it!
{211}
Jehovah's first act on the westward side of Jordan was to incorporate a poor Canaanitish woman of bad repute in His Israel, and not only so, but make her the chief "mother in Israel" of that day. For, as we know, Salmon married her, and she became the mother of Boaz, the great-grandfather of David, and thus directly into the line of which Christ, God's Anointed, came. Jehovah would secure a heart for Himself even in Jericho, and in one of its most disreputable inhabitants. He would bless a Gentile, and even bring in Christ through her posterity. He would put faith in such a vessel as Rahab, and then send His messengers to bring it to light!
Is it not blessed to think that God can work like this in the very midst of appalling darkness and corruption? Who can tell the spiritual condition of the world today? The innumerable forms of evil thought and teaching that abound in activity? All coming out of the heavenlies, from evil spirits who are there! But in the very midst of it all, and in those who have been fully identified with it, He secures something for Himself -- a house marked by faith that recognises His actings by Christ and by the Spirit on behalf of His people, and where His power and His kindness are fully owned.
The work of God in Rahab's soul had completely detached her morally from Jericho before the messengers came. Jehovah was her God and Jehovah's people her people, so that when the spies came she received them with peace. She was in harmony with what was outside the city, and in complete separation morally from what was inside. That is the position for us today. As a matter of fact we are still in Jericho, but we are there as completely dissociated morally from everything that is of Jericho. Our interests and hopes are all connected with what is outside the city. I wonder if that is true of us?
If we have not Rahab's faith and Rahab's works we are hardly prepared to learn the lessons of the book of Joshua. It is just as important for us to be justified by works as by faith. Faith is nothing if it does not result in a changed outlook; that is, we, like Rahab, must have not only a door but a

window. Rahab's door spoke of her faith, for by it she received the spies; but she had also a window, an outlook, and her works were connected with her window. We all need to have a door; there is no blessing without a faith door. But James tells us that she put forth the messengers "by another way", that was the window. Her window was her outlook. Her door must have been on the city side of her house. We find later that the door was to be opened to let anybody in who liked to enter, but there was to be no going out that way; if anyone went out of the door his blood would be on his own head.
Rahab received what came from God from outside the city, and she identified herself with it, and it linked her with Jehovah's army -- typically with all that was divine and spiritual. The messengers did not leave her as they found her; she "put them forth by another way". She understood they did not belong to Jericho at all; nor did she as to her hopes. She was really the first one to dwell in the land with a divine outlook, and as fully identified with the actings of God.
It is good to pass through the door of Rahab's house, for her house represents the household of faith; once through that door there must be no going back to the city. All our hopes and aspirations after that become connected with the window that looks outside the city. Perhaps some of us have a window on the wrong side of the house! This incident is a striking one as connected with the household principle; for Rahab was not exactly head of the house, but one who had a father and mother, and brethren and sisters, and she claimed them all for the blessing of God. Her faith was a household faith; she not only judged Jericho for herself, but she would have everyone connected with her to share the same judgment. If people passed out of the street of Jericho through the door of Rahab's house they figuratively left the world, to come into the sphere of faith, and there must be no going back through that door. If any went out, their blood would be on their own head. So, as Hebrews tells us, to go back is destruction. It is open to anyone to leave Jericho's people
{213}
and king and politics, and everything else connected with it. You can leave all by the door of Rahab's house, by the door of faith; but to go back means apostasy and destruction.
It was salvation to come into Rahab's house. "By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish along with the unbelieving, having received the spies in peace" (@Hebrews 11: 31). To separate oneself from the Jericho world is a fine thing. Rahab's door opened to let in her father and mother, brethren and sisters. Everybody who had any kinship with Rahab could come in. The question is, 'Am I one of Rahab's kinsfolk? Have I the same kind of faith as she had: faith that will judge the world in its strongest and most established form, and separate from it, and that will identify itself with God and His people, and with all that God is going to do in the purposes of His love for the honour of His Son?' It is fine to see that Rahab claimed all her kindred for blessing; and we are told that they all came in and identified themselves with her faith.
Lot did not save his house; he escaped himself, but so as by fire. Alas! many are like that; securing blessing for themselves but leaving their kindred outside! How could a christian parent be content to know he was linked up with the people of God, and not be concerned as to whether his children will perish with the unbelieving or not? It is sad to think that there are christian parents who take little care that their children should walk in the same path as themselves; parents full of thought and desire and energy in looking after the physical and worldly benefit of their children, who do not read the Word with them or take them aside and pray with them, or speak to them of the Lord. What can they expect!
Rahab's care was not only for herself, but that everyone connected with her should look at things as she did. How could any of us rest if we have relatives who do not think of things as we do, and feel about things as we do? Shall we not pray night and day, and do everything we can to bring them, so to speak, inside the door?
Rahab is a fine example of the kind of spirit produced by
{214}
the sovereign call of God, and by His working in the soul.
Jehovah was her God; she said, "He is God in the heavens above and in the earth beneath". She had done with the gods of Jericho, and all her hopes were connected with Jehovah and His people. She realised that God is not only powerful but kind, so she asked confidently for kindness from His people. What a knowledge of God she had! She had been brought up all her life under the influence of gods who were marked by the grossest forms of inhuman cruelty; but now she had a thought of God as One who is kind and whose people are kind. What a revolution had taken place in her soul!
Her window looked outside the city! Our works are connected with our outlook; my outlook determines the whole character of my spiritual life. What is my outlook? Rahab had not the slightest interest in the things of Jericho; her window looked outside the city, it looked in the direction of the people of God. Those who think of making the world better have their window on the wrong side of the house! What is outside the city? The ark of the covenant, Joshua, the priests and the people of Jehovah! They were coming in to take possession of the land! Rahab looked out in that direction; she put forth the messengers by another way. They came in at the door, but they went out by the window; "she let them down by a cord through the window". That is very suggestive. She linked herself personally with those two men by a cord. It spoke of the fact that she linked herself in her affections definitely and firmly with the people of God. If Rahab had not been drawn by cords of love she would not have had any wish to link herself with the people and servants of God; but she definitely linked herself with them when she let them down by a cord, and the men did not forget it. They said, "Thou shalt bind in the window this line of scarlet thread by which thou hast let us down".
Typically scarlet is a colour connected with the rights of Jehovah in Israel. Rahab acknowledged those rights; putting the scarlet thread in the window was her public confession
{215}
that all rights were with Jehovah and not with the king of Jericho. He had the right to dispose of the land as He willed according to His good pleasure. She confessed it publicly; and it characterised her outlook; she put it in the window.
At the present time what is our outlook? Is it not that in a very brief moment every other power is going to give way to the kingdom of our God and His Christ? That is our outlook and confession; not exactly before the world in this connection, but a confession which is such as the people of God can take account of. There is an aspect of confession that the world can take account of; that is, confession as in Romans. But there is another that the people of God can take account of; that is, confession according to the epistle to the Hebrews. Rahab did not put up the scarlet line for the people of Jericho to see, but for the people of God to see. In Matthew they mockingly put a scarlet robe on Christ; in mockery they invested Him with royal dignity in Israel. But Rahab typically confessed His rights in reality. Whatever you confess you will get the distinction of. She was not only saved, but Salmon married her, and Boaz was her son; and she came into the royal genealogy as the mother of God's anointed. In putting up the scarlet line she confessed before the people of God the rights of God. It is like God to bring in the Gentile to possess the land, and to possess it as in the royal lineage! The history of Rahab is wonderful.
"She ... put them forth by another way". It is good when we turn from the door to the window! If I only think of the door of faith I am thinking of my own blessing. Many thousands of God's people are thankful for the door who have not considered the window. But it is an important question, 'What is your outlook?' Daniel had a window; his outlook was towards Jerusalem, though it was only a heap of ruins; it was to him the city of the great King. Rahab's window opened towards the people of God as they were in God's mind; it opened to all the purposes of God concerning them. The spies took their cue from Rahab; they did not need to examine the fortifications, or to count the enemy's
{216}
soldiers; Rahab's faith was enough for them, and they went back to report the outlook of Rahab. They said not a word about the king or his chariots, or anything else, but they reported the situation as it appeared from Rahab's window.
The ten spies that Moses sent said the cities were walled up to heaven, but what does it matter if the wall is to heaven if God has taken possession of it? God took possession of the wall when He took possession of Rahab, for her house was on the wall. When the walls came down flat, that piece stood, so the spies went in and brought all Rahab's household out.
In @Proverbs 31 the woman clothes all her household in scarlet. That is a beautiful thought; she brings them all up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. It is a fine state of things in a household. The head of every christian household is to be marked by two things; he has been himself nurtured by the Lord, and he has been admonished by the Lord. The Lord has corrected his many mistakes; he has been nurtured on one hand and admonished on the other, and that qualifies him to bring up his children in the same kind of education. He can tell them, 'I am passing on to you how the Lord has dealt with me. The Lord has nurtured me and admonished me, and I pass it on to you'.
Rahab hid the messengers; you do not give away your secrets to the world. She came into the position of a traitor to her own people. We may as well look it straight in the face; we cannot be among the people of God without being traitors to what goes on in the world. If I am a friend of the world I am an enemy of God, and if I want to be a friend of God I must be a traitor to the world. You cannot imagine Rahab putting the spies out of the window and keeping up friendly intercourse with people inside the city. She had transferred her allegiance from the king of Jericho to Jehovah; she became a traitor to the king of Jericho, and she hid the spies. That constituted the works by which she was justified. She had her secrets, and we have ours. If the people of this world knew what we thought about the world system,
{217}
they would think less favourably of us than they do; they would hardly think us fit to live.
It is interesting to note that she secreted the men "under the stalks of flax" (verse 6). It has been happily suggested that "flax" is linen in its crude form, and linen speaks of righteousness (@Revelation 19: 8). This would intimate, typically, that Rahab had judged everything in her past history that was not according to God; her old associations as a citizen of Jericho, and her former moral condition as a harlot all judged and done with. She is not seen as yet clothed in fine linen, but she has become possessed of the raw material, and is preparing it for use. It is suggestive of the wholly new moral condition which is to become characteristic of those who know God. They wear new garments, even "fine linen, bright and pure; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints".
As a matter of fact the walls of Jericho have not fallen yet. The great intellectual centres, the accumulated forces of human intellect and thought and progress, all influenced by wicked spirits in the heavenlies, are standing up as high as heaven, but they are coming down soon; and it is a great thing to judge them and by faith see them fallen morally before they actually come down. This chapter is an important one, especially for us Gentiles, because it sets forth in a striking way the calling and work and grace of God in a Gentile.
JORDAN
@Joshua 3: 1 - 17
Jordan is a type of death as that into which Christ has entered that He might annul its power so that life and incorruptibility might be brought to light in Him as risen from among the dead. Life in the power of resurrection was in God's thought for the saints of the assembly, and this can only be entered
{218}
into through Christ setting aside the power of death and taking His place in risen life in which He becomes the life of those who are His own. There can be no question that Christ as risen is outside the life of this world, and we only live spiritually in what God has purposed for us as risen with Him. We have to learn the great power of Christ to hold death in abeyance for His own even at a time when publicly nothing is changed. So that His saints can enter now in the Spirit into what is beyond death; they can have life in that region even while they are still here in flesh-and-blood conditions. But to enjoy that life they must pass over Jordan, and the scripture shows how they can do so. "When ye see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God" (verse 3).
The great thing is to see the ark and go after it. Our eyes must be fixed upon Christ and for this we must read the gospels; we must learn what he was before he went into death. The glory of His divine Person must be understood, and this I believe is signified by the words, "Yet there shall be a distance between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure" (verse 4). He was entirely of His own order, a divine Person in manhood, and yet here to bring all that God was in grace near to men. But if we do not apprehend His inscrutable greatness we shall have no right estimate of the grace in which He was here. We read in the same chapter of Him saying, "Before Abraham was, I am", and of Him saying to a publicly convicted sinner, "Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more" (@John 8).

MINISTRY ON JUDGES
{220}
{221}
FROM C.A.C.S NOTES
@Judges 1:12 - 15
This incident is recorded in the book of Joshua (chapter 15) which is a book of success, but it is also found in Judges which is a book of failure, bringing it down, as it were, to our own times. What was needed at the beginning of our dispensation is just what is needed at the end of it. Achsah, representing a certain phase of assembly exercise, says, "Thou hast given me a southern land". She had the most favoured position, and that should never be out of our thoughts; God has given us the very best. The angel Gabriel said to Mary, "Hail, thou favoured one": no one could doubt that she was blessed among women. She had the very best that God could give: she was the chosen vessel to bring into humanity that Holy Thing which was to be called Son of God. But Luke has suggested to us that Mary was one of the assembly (@Acts 1) and I believe it is right to say that, though she gave Him birth, she has no better title to Him than any other saint of the assembly. The "southern land", as far as we are concerned, is the favourableness of God expressed in His Son coming into the world; "The dayspring from on high".
But He is now glorified; three disciples were permitted to see His glory on the holy mount; He is now the Beloved and we are graced in Him. We know our place before God in Him. We are sons of God by faith in Christ Jesus. The position is most favourable, set forth in the younger son of @Luke 15. What it was to God to have such a Son (our Lord Jesus Christ) in manhood! And now He is glorified. Our place in Him is entirely the fruit of redemption and new creation.
This is all so great that it can only be kept in freshness and power in our souls by "springs of water". The "upper
{222}
springs" would have reference to the purpose or heavenly side of our blessing, the "lower springs" to the responsible life here. If we grieve the Spirit it is like throwing earth into the springs. If we realised the value of the Spirit, we should be very careful about grieving Him. This is for the enjoyment of the inheritance, so that it would go along with sowing to the Spirit so as to reap life eternal. Use the springs: it is implied that if Achsah got the springs she would use them.
The springs of water in this type would go more with @John 7 -- the inheritance is refreshed. It is coming to Jesus as glorified and drinking. It is first inward satisfaction in drinking from this wonderful fountain and then rivers flow out in an affectionate and feeling way amongst the brethren first. The individual believer becomes representative of the house and the throne. The apostles exemplified it.
The first sign of weakness was that Judah does not dispossess the inhabitants of the valley because they had chariots of iron, and this although it is said in the same verse (verse 19) "Jehovah was with Judah". That is, they failed to take account of the power of God: "Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world" (@1 John 4: 4). The power of the antichrist is very great and he has in his arsenal all the chariots of modern thought, but we are to be overcomers in a greater power.
Then the children of Benjamin did not dispossess the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem (verse 21). This seems to be a question of the *rights* of God, for it was the city of the great King -- the place where Jehovah set His name. How soon things come in to challenge the rights of God in Christ. Is Christ entitled to be supreme as Son over God's house? Baptised to Christ is to own His rights: John speaks much of commandments, and then there are the commandments of the Lord in 1 Corinthians. If I do not own the rights of Christ my baptism is null and void, save as added responsibility. Jerusalem represents the rights of Christ as King and Head. Then the house of Joseph went up against Bethel (verses
{223}
22 - 26). They enlisted the co-operation of a man out of the city. If you accept the aid of the world you must show it kindness: Luz means a bend or curve; it is not a straight line. This man loved his city, though he was willing to purchase his own life by betraying it. He perpetuated its name where he went. How many things have got a twist through the help of the world being solicited or accepted! Constantine; the political powers at the Reformation; things retained that have no place at Bethel. Here it is a question of the *truth* of God. The house of God is the pillar and base of the truth. In Christendom the divine things are there, but they are bent to suit man; but in God's house all must be straight to suit God: "Cutting in a straight line the word of truth" (@2 Timothy 2: 15).
Then in Manasseh we find that "the Canaanites would dwell in that land" (verses 27, 28). The will of man got the ascendancy and was allowed. Thus even when Israel was strong they made the Canaanites tributary. There was not spiritual power to destroy heathen superstitions, so they were made tributary.
Then in Ephraim the Canaanites dwelt among them, as also Zebulun (verses 29, 30). Worldly principles found amongst the people of God and dwelling there -- birds of heaven come and roost in its branches.
Then the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land (verses 31, 32), and so with Naphtali (verse 33). Now the people of God are in the world.
Then finally the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill-country (verse 34). They have now fully the upper hand. I suppose the hill-country has always been available -- Luke chapter 1.
This is the history of the post-apostolic church. In 1 John we get the warnings and the antidotes: we love our brother. Then the world, the many antichrists, the liars, those who lead us astray: whatever we ask we receive from Him. "We know that he abides in us, by the Spirit which he has given to us" (chapter 3: 24). "Prove the spirits, if they are of God"
{224}
(chapter 4: 1). "All that has been begotten of God gets the victory over the world" (chapter 5: 4). "If we ask him anything according to his will he hears us" (chapter 5: 14). "Many false prophets are gone out into the world" (chapter 4: 1). "Who soever goes forward" (@2 John 9).
FROM C.A.C.S NOTES
@Judges 2: 1 - 23
It is interesting to see that the last mention of Gilgal, as regards anything transpiring there, is when Caleb came to Joshua to ask for his inheritance (@Joshua 14). The end of @Joshua 10 is the last return of Joshua and all Israel to Gilgal. The Angel of Jehovah was there though they did not know it. The secret now comes out of the increasing weakness of chapter 1. It is the allowance of the flesh in oneself that exposes us to its influence and power in others -- the world, the many antichrists, the liars, those who lead you astray, the practice of lawlessness, many false prophets, and the wicked one. If there was no allowance of the flesh in me there would be power to overcome: this is the real secret of overcoming, the armour is over our spiritual state (@Ephesians 6).
But if we fail to return to Gilgal and lose power to overcome, the things which we ought to have overcome remain as a scourge and snare. Jehovah gave up His people to the enemies whom they had allowed through lack of self-judgment. The people weep (verse 4): there is still a measure of right feeling with them; and they sacrifice to Jehovah (verse 5): there is still some sense of what is due to Him. But the power of God is no longer with them for victory; they are left to be scourged and consumed by the things to which they have given place. It is a summing up of the whole history after the death of Joshua.
{225}
Verse 6 goes back to the days of Joshua and the elders who survived him. The people served Jehovah during that generation, but another generation arose who knew not Jehovah, nor yet the works which He had done for Israel: succeeding to privileges without soul history. Never having known the bondage of Egypt or the humblings of the wilderness, having no experimental knowledge of the passover or the Red Sea, or the brazen serpent or the passage of Jordan, nor any personal knowledge of God. God would impress upon us thus that each generation must take up things for itself; we cannot go in the faith of those who preceded us. Paul speaks of the unfeigned faith which was in Lois and Eunice, but he adds that it was in Timothy also. Timothy was Paul's true child in faith (@1 Timothy 1).
Our parents might have had us baptised and instructed us in things, but they could not give us personal knowledge of God or of His works; that we have to take up for ourselves.
So that now other masters or persons are served. That is, the things which rule are of men; "Other lords have had dominion over us". The Ashtoreths (verse 13) might represent what would corrupt our affections. The Baals would be more what the energies are engaged in: it would be what we turn to for amusement or recreation.
Jehovah raised up judges who saved them; but if God raises up a judge he must be listened to. Jehovah was with the judge, He had pity. They ceased not from their own doings nor from their stubborn way.
Jehovah left the nations to prove Israel. "Spoilers that spoiled them" (verse 14). Are we really enjoying the land? Being oppressed and crushed would mean every influence brought to bear that would hinder the enjoyment of the land. Who can tell the religious oppression of penances and the terror of purgatory and the much labour that bears no spiritual fruit?
{226}
THE CITADEL OF PIETY
@Judges 2: 10
Our children are to grow up under divine teaching and impressions. It is a deep exercise to read in @Judges 2: 10, "And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers; and there arose another generation after them, which knew not Jehovah, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel". What an exposure of the conditions of Israel! What an uncovering of household secrets! Where had been the teaching of the children? Where the all-pervading influence of @Deuteronomy 11: 18 - 20? which says, "And ye shall lay up these my words in your heart ... and ye shall teach them unto your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thy house ... and write them upon the posts of thy house, and upon thy gates".
Alas! it had not been there. Some may say, 'But we bring our children to the gatherings of God's people; they will learn and be impressed there'. Neither such gatherings nor any other instruction can take the place of divine impressions in the home. What goes on in these gatherings will not have moral power if it is not supported in the households of the saints. Children may forget what they hear on such occasions but can the oldest man ever forget the impressions made upon him by the home piety of his parents? It is because of such hallowed influences being passed on "that your days may be multiplied, and *the days of your children*, in the land which Jehovah swore unto your fathers to give them".
The fact that the next generation did not know Jehovah, nor His works, is solemn evidence that the public weakness and departure which so soon manifested itself in Israel had its origin in individual heart and soul departure, and in the households of God's people ceasing to be what they were meant to be -- the very citadel of piety.
{227}
ADDRESS ON THE SECOND BOOK OF SAMUEL
{228}
{229}
A SPIRITUAL FINISH
@2 Samuel 17: 27 - 29; @2 Samuel 19: 31 - 43; @Philippians 3: 7 - 13; @Habakkuk 3: 17 - 19
It is of all importance that we should take account of the close of our journey here, and I desire to present to you what a spiritual finish is. We are very near now to seeing the Lord's face, and we ought to speak together in this hope. The Holy Spirit is giving to the saints today a sense of the expectation of it: we shall see Him come into all His rights, but I am thinking more of the blessedness of His very presence, surrounded with delight by all His own.
Paul writes to the Thessalonians in a different way from that to any other assembly. They had just recently been gathered to the Lord's name. Paul writes, not to the assembly at Thessalonica, but to the assembly of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. I suppose they were very young and, just gathered to the Lord's name, had not been formed in assembly truth and principles, and he writes to them in that simple way. He presents the Lord and the Lord's coming in such a way as to set their hearts right, not only in relation to the testimony, but in the knowledge of divine Persons. He presents not only the public appearing of the Lord Jesus, but also the way we shall meet Him in the air.
In the second chapter of 2 Thessalonians, Paul beseeches them by "the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to him". It is an expression of peculiar sweetness. Think of all saints gathering together unto Him -- not His name, but to Himself, and as the same scripture says, "live together with Him". That is our eternity, our full portion with Christ. We are not only to *be* together but we are to *live* together with Him. This is really what is to touch our
{230}
hearts and fill them with that expectancy of love that regards the Lord's coming with supreme anticipation of pleasure.
After presenting the hope of the Lord's coming in the first epistle, the apostle in chapters 1 and 2 of the second epistle gives words of consolation and instruction in view of the coming apostasy. Then he says, "But our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and our God and Father, who has loved us, and given us eternal consolation and good hope by grace, encourage your hearts, and establish you in every good work and word". Nothing, not even the thickness of tissue paper, is to come between the Lord and our hearts; so we should have the enjoyment of our relationship with the Lord Jesus and with our God in service and in suffering for the testimony. It is the consciousness of the immediate support and love of the heart of Christ and the place we have eternally in our Father's heart and purpose that is our proper start: if we are to continue and to finish well we must make this beginning.
Now in speaking of Barzillai I wish to draw attention to this very serious consideration, that a person may have a good start and make progress, and then go back, the Lord having lost in the heart the place He had at first. There is nothing sadder than departure from the Lord Himself, and I suppose the history of Barzillai has been given to us in Scripture so that we should be able to take account of the sadness of spiritual enfeeblement. Barzillai and his companions met David when he was in reproach, bringing the very best they had, and no mean provision it was. The Spirit of God gives us a list of what they brought -- beds, basons and earthen vessels; wheat, barley, parched corn, flour, beans, lentils, pulse, honey, cream, sheep and cheese. The Lord does not forget our work of faith and labour of love, and if He has enlarged us and blessed us so that we have been able to minister to Him and to His own, He never forgets it. But how sad if the freshness that prompted it has declined in our souls!
Now in chapter 19, David returns to Jerusalem and Mephibosheth is there to greet him. Mephibosheth's affection has
{231}
been sustained; he has been feeling the absence of David and the falling away from David of many in Jerusalem, and through the testing time of David's absence he has ever remembered him with affectionate regard for his person and rights: his happiness is bound up with God's beloved. David mentions the inheritance, but Mephibosheth replies, 'It is not that I am thinking of: I am not troubled about the inheritance, everything to me is that you have come back'. What a comfort to the heart of David! A welcome from a heart that had never declined but beat true in his absence.
But it is otherwise with Barzillai; he meets the king and follows him over Jordan. David makes a proposition to Barzillai, 'Come up to Jerusalem and I will feed you. I do not forget that when in adversity you fed me, and now I want you to be my guest in Jerusalem; I want to sustain and feed you there'. What an invitation! The Lord proposes an advancement spiritually for us -- that we should go right up into the heart of blessing, where Christ is supreme, that we should dwell with Him in His Jerusalem. We should enjoy now what we are to enjoy eternally with Christ. The Lord finds pleasure in our willing response to that. Although the Lord regards with delight every bit of service towards Himself as it comes out in relation to His people -- caring for them, feeding them, serving Him in His interests here, just as Barzillai and his associates cared for David and his followers -- yet more deeply valued still by the Lord Jesus is the devoted affection that will follow Him up to Jerusalem where He may share in grace all He possesses with us there, and serve us that we may fully enjoy it all. "He will gird himself and make them recline at table, and coming up will serve them" (@Luke 12: 37).
Our being occupied with His interests here is one thing, but it is another His welcoming us into heavenly scenes even now in spirit, to share the fulness of what His ascending there has secured. It is blessed, but if it is to be responded to it calls for personal spiritual energy. It takes vigour of soul to pass up from Jordan to Jerusalem, and it is just the lack of that which
{232}
comes out typically in Barzillai's case. David had lost in Barzillai's heart the place he once had. If you watch Barzillai's feet you know where his heart is. He says, 'I am not as young as I was once nor as able to go about; I am superannuated; it is time I retired from the conflict. I will go over Jordan a little today'. It is very good to cross Jordan even for a visit, but David's proposal was that he should go up and *reside* with him, and he said, "I will maintain thee". Does your heart incline to follow the Lord over Jordan into the sphere where He is owned as the risen One? If you do, that is well, but He wants you further. He wants to lead your heart up to heaven, that you may know and enjoy heavenly things.
The Lord attracts us over Jordan that He may set our minds on heavenly things. It may be only a visit at the start, but you cannot cross very often without feeling it would be good to follow the Lord up to Jerusalem and remain with Him where He is supreme, and where He maintains all. We may come down to this side to serve His interests here, but our centre and home is with Him there. Barzillai says, 'I am old, I will go a little way'. Do you think a saint in spiritual energy would speak like that? Remember the walk Enoch took with God -- it was as "the path of the just ... that shineth more and more unto the perfect day" (@Proverbs 4: 18). Do any of us feel old spiritually? Is it that once there was a discernment of divine things and an appetite for the things of Christ, and now one is at a loss when hearing others speak of things one is unable to discern? You have grey hairs and you know it not, age has crept on and you did not observe it, affection for Christ has waned and the heart has turned to something else, and the Lord Jesus is accorded a second place where once He was first.
It is very serious if one is beginning to find a lack of edge in one's taste for divine things. Barzillai said, 'I am not able any more to hear the sound of singing men and singing women'. It is important to see that spiritual things are sustained in deep spiritual joy, and saints who are going on spiritually are bound to sing. Wherever saints are sustained in spiritual

affection for Christ and for His interests they are bound to sing. When David is having His place in Jerusalem there is bound to be singing there. We should be at liberty, not only to *hear* the saints sing, but to sing *with* them. David said (@Psalm 87) "This man was born there" -- Zion. "Jehovah will count when he inscribeth the peoples, This man was born there". Christ is the Man who was born there; Jerusalem is His city, and this psalm speaks of the singers and dancers being there. It is the place God loves, "He loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob".
Now the men and women singing tell of the intelligent and affectionate interest of the saints in everything being established in Christ, and that He fills the heart of God and His people so that God should find His pleasure in a company of saints who sing to Him. There is a reference in Job to the morning stars singing together and all the sons of God shouting for joy. They saw what God had before Him and were delighted in sympathy with it. What a poor estimate of the heart of David Barzillai had! "Wherefore should thy servant be a burden to the king?" Affection for Christ would cast you entirely upon all that He gives -- the care and support that would love to carry you across Jordan and up to Jerusalem and set you down amongst His happy company so that you should partake of all the value of the best things in Jerusalem. One feels that unconsciously there was with Barzillai a doubt of the affections of David. Barzillai says his servant Chimham shall go: Chimham means 'longing'. David must have felt, 'Ah, Barzillai, I have lost my supreme place in your affections'. Chimham gets all that Barzillai misses.
Now I have read the passage of Scripture from Habakkuk to illustrate what it is to have a good spiritual finish, what it is to sing in spiritual energy at the close. His day was like the day in which we live. He took account of things as they were among the people of God publicly, and it broke his heart. Habakkuk is a heart-broken man because of the testimony. There had been departure from the Lord, and there is no course for him, devoted man that he was, but to stand upon
{234}
the watch-tower and pray. A broken heart in relation to the testimony first of all isolates you, puts you in a separate path, and there you get a divine start. He is praying, and soon light as to the whole mind of God comes before him; he sees that the issue of it is that the Lord will come out in His power and rid the scene of all desolation, and the whole earth will be filled with His glory.
What view have you got from your watch-tower? Habakkuk had a view of things as God had secured them for His own pleasure: "Although the fig tree shall not blossom neither shall fruit be in the vines, the labour of the olive shall fail ..." -- although desolation shall mark the whole scene before me, "Yet shall I rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation". Then he says, "He maketh my feet like hinds feet, and He will make me to walk upon my high places". What a bright contrast to what we have been regarding! Here we have spiritual energy, no old age, and a man able to scale up to high places. There are for us all the blessed privileges peculiar to the assembly in our high places, but it needs hinds feet -- spiritual vigour to rise to them. Now Habakkuk can sing, "To the chief Musician. On my stringed instruments"! That is the end of a man's path who through exercise rose to the possibilities of the day in which he lived. A spiritual man ends with hinds feet, high places and stringed instruments. You have them all in @Philippians 3 in our apostle, and how exhilarating to hear his call to us! There is no idea of retiring from the race here, and no note of depression. Instead of decline there is increase: "Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss". His taste is with him -- no grey hairs, no waning affection or enfeebled vision; he sees clearly. And it is all Christ and Christ *in heaven*, and so Paul is full of joy. He rejoices in the Lord.
May the Lord encourage us to follow Himself to where He is, and be thus kept amid the ruin of the moment in affection for Himself and appreciation of heavenly things, with hinds feet in high places, and among the singing men and women with stringed instruments.

READINGS AND ADDRESS ON 2 KINGS

THE DOUBLE PORTION
@2 Kings 2: 9
To have "a double portion" of the Spirit of the Man taken up into heaven is one of the great outstanding wonders which Scripture presents to us. This marvellous gift is set before us as something to be desired in a very distinctive way by lovers of Christ. It is for those who apprehend Christ as taken into heaven, and who wish to be empowered to represent Him here. "Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me. And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so to thee; but if not, it shall not be so" (@2 Kings 2: 9, 10). Elisha loved Elijah enough to want a double portion of his spirit. Now the question is, Do we love Christ in heaven enough to want a double portion of His Spirit? Those who have never had much exercise about the Spirit, or any great desire to have Him, cannot be said to have qualified for the reception of the Spirit. There was desire on the part of Elisha, and yet there was an "if" on Elijah's part, and he told Elisha that he had asked "a hard thing". This is to let us know that a double portion of the Spirit of the Man in heaven is not a small thing with God, and it will not be upon us apart from genuine exercise.
I believe that the thought of having "a double portion" of the Spirit is that those who have it are distinguished as the firstborn was distinguished (@Deuteronomy 21: 17). But it is a distinguishment which is open to every believer who desires it, and who apprehends Christ in heaven as "having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit". The Lord as risen spoke to His disciples of "the promise of the Father" (@Acts 1: 4),
{238}
but before that promise could be fulfilled to the disciples Jesus had to receive it as exalted by the right hand of God (@Acts 2: 33). The promise of the Father has been received by the exalted Man in heaven. And I believe there must be some apprehension of Him as in heaven, and as receiving the promise of the Father there, to qualify, if I may use the word, to receive a double portion of His Spirit.
Hence Elijah says, "If thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so to thee". It was conditional on seeing him when taken. For us it would imply a definite apprehension of Jesus as taken up into heaven, and as receiving there of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit.
I trust we can all see how great a matter this is. If Jesus were not in heaven He would not have received the Holy Spirit as the promise of the Father, and there would have been no double portion of His Spirit to be upon His lovers here. He imparts to His lovers here who desire it a double portion of what He has received of the Father in heaven -- not, of course, that they have twice as much as He has, but they have what He has in a wonderful and distinguishing way. But this is not something to make us important as men living upon the earth, for Elisha had gone through Jordan with Elijah before he asked for a double portion of his spirit. It is as accepting death here that we can be truly distinguished in relation to Christ in heaven, for the Spirit is the Spirit of an exalted Man in heaven. We should think much of the Spirit in this connection. The Lord when here said, "How much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him" or, as it may read, "the Father, who from heaven will give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him" (@Luke 11: 13). He put stress upon the fact that the Spirit would be given from heaven -- a conscious, inward link with heaven given by the Father, but given to them that ask Him, showing that the Lord would awaken interest in this great gift, and a desire for it. If it has never been the subject of desire, and of asking, it can hardly be rightly appreciated.
{239}
@Acts 1 tells us how the Lord was taken up into heaven, and chapter 2 makes known how the Spirit was poured out by Him with the result that such a powerful testimony was given that about three thousand souls were added to the believers in one day. "Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptised, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For to you is the promise and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God may call". They would all understand that this heavenly gift was a present reality; the evidence of it was there before their eyes and sounding in their ears. Each one of them would be intensely concerned to have part in this great "promise". We cannot suppose that one of them would be content to be uncertain whether he had received the promised gift or not. The apostles were special vessels of the power of the Spirit, and afterwards Stephen and Philip, but the gift of the Spirit was expressly declared to be a matter of promise to "as many as the Lord our God may call". No believer should think that this wondrous gift is not for him, or that he has no need to concern himself about it.

@2 Kings 8: 1 - 29
C.A.C. God uses world-powers to chastise His people -- Hazael was anointed by God for it. He may suspend things for a number of years; so that God's ways in the Old Testament are very instructive: He said of Moab, "Moab is my wash-pot" (@Psalm 108: 9), to be used for the purification of His people.
Rem. "For behold, I command, and I will shake the house of Israel to and fro among all the nations, like as one shaketh corn in a sieve; yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth" (@Amos 9: 9).
{240}
C.A.C. That is very beautiful, God never loses a grain. We are all sifted. It is part of His ways to allow His people to be sifted. God has His purifying and cleansing work to do in His people. Personally I find it best to be kept under exercise; it is profitable and all helps to promote the heavenly; that at least is the divine intent. We should always be ready to weep if God's people are suffering, and still recognise God's hand in it. They are masters of the situation.
There is a moral reason for persecution. In the church in Ephesus it was departure from first love, and Smyrna is persecuted. The moral reason for it on the Continent is departure and worldliness on the part of God's people. It checks the movements of evil and exercises us. What a purifying effect it would have if we expected any day to be carried off to prison or martyrdom. All events are known to God beforehand, and yet he often does not prevent them. Hazael's death was perfectly known to Him, and the manner of it.
We should read the prophetic ministry with the historical books. The prophets give the moral state of the people; so today the prophetic ministry shows what God is at, how He is moving in things.
The woman here accepts the situation, compare @Revelation 12. It is an epoch in our lives when we accept the wilderness position. The Man-child has gone up and the church has gone up too-in Him.

@2 Kings 11: 1 - 21
C.A.C. Joash is the first king since Solomon to be a definite type of Christ -- a type that should appeal to our hearts in a peculiar way as one hidden and preserved of God in a time of apostasy. It is typical of the place Christ has in His assembly,
{241}
kept all the while in their affections until publicly manifested. He is treasured in the house of the Lord at a time when the antichristian element is dominant in the world. God does not intend that Christ shall not have a place, and He will preserve whatever is precious to Himself.
Jehosheba means, 'The oath of Jehovah', indicating faithfulness to preserve everything of Christ in a day of apostasy, because of God's faithfulness, and also of faithfulness in men. To be entrusted with Christ is more honourable than to trust Christ. The apostle says, "Keep, by the Holy Spirit which dwells in us, the good deposit entrusted" (@2 Timothy 1: 14); in one word that must be Christ. All has now to be guarded, and we are to be His 'bodyguard'.
Rem. Here it is the priest, not the prophet. Eleazar had to stand before Joshua.
C.A.C. The priestly element is to be controlled. The priestly element is necessary, therefore the king and priest go together.
The nurse of Joash would indicate the tender care for that which is youthful among us of Christ. What do we know of Christ? None of us could set up to know much of Him. Those knowing most would say they knew but little. What do we know of the sonship of Christ?
There is at the present time no fresh element of evil. The apostle wrote, "It is the last hour" (@1 John 2: 18) and all the elements were present before the apostles left this scene. Here it is to sworn men that the king's son is shown. If people are anxious to find the Lord, where will they find Him today? In the same place, in the house of the Lord. You will not find Him in public places. In the beginning of Luke He was found in the hearts of a few; Simeon, Anna, Elizabeth, and others. Elizabeth means, 'The oath of God'. Faithfulness is the great outstanding feature of God, so His people must swear, too, and be like Him. Can God commit to us His thoughts of Christ today?
Ques. We speak much of the military element, but is not
{242}
the nursing element needed as well, when that which is of Christ is small?
C.A.C. Yes indeed. Paul says of the Galatians, "Of whom I again travail in birth until Christ shall have been formed in you" (@Galatians 4: 19). They had not really come into this wonderful trust. That is our business, brethren. To nourish that, for Christ will have no place unless He is built up in the hearts of His people. One side is connected with the hidden character of things -- the treasure hidden in the field, treasure which when found a man hides. The Lord is not competing with the public position; He accepts the hidden position, and so must we.
The word 'sacrament' means originally in Latin, 'A military oath of allegiance'. The Supper is the most solemn oath we can put our hand to. It is allegiance to Christ as the rejected One and who is hidden. We announce His death "until he come" (@1 Corinthians 11: 26). I have often said that the faithfulness of God is the rock of eternity, but God looks for faithfulness in His people too.
This was all done before they saw the king's son, and no one else will see Him otherwise. They were His bodyguard, before the oath was taken. We are more apt to think of our being taken care of by Christ, but that is an infantile thought. The division into three companies would suggest we have to accept our allotted part in the guarding. We need our weapons in our hands or we may make friends with the world. Peter used his in a carnal way, and so had none when he went into the high priest's palace. Paul tells us what his weapons are in @2 Corinthians 10: 4. The couriers would be like Anna who had the remarkable faculty of knowing the people to speak to. David's weapons were ancient things.
Rem. We can go back one hundred years.
C.A.C. Yes, we can go back nineteen hundred years! Every spiritual weapon in the house of God is available to us if we are man enough to use it.
The Lord's sonship is the great truth brought forward
{243}
lately. What God is doing today is a profound secret, only known to sworn men who were to be with the king, "When he goes out and when he comes in" (verse 8). The Lord has movements among His own. It is Christ as Son getting His place in the house circle: the assembly is where Christ gets the place that is due to Him. It is what His supper is intended to lead to. The Supper is the beginning of our meeting, not the end. A circle is provided where He is, in view of His glory and of worshipping Him.
As Lord He is predominant: as the Son He is pre-eminent. The Supper is in His absence, but when we make Him a supper He is there and all worship goes out to Him. We may not be conscious, but the Lord is conscious when He has His place, and is then free to lead us to His God and Father. Lazarus was raised to be a companion of the One who raised him. If the breaking of bread is early there is more room to pass on.
Rem. The conditions must be there.
C.A.C. The conditions are generally there, and we should be ready to come under the influence of the bread and the cup. We must bring the conditions with us to the meetings. The sisters can get all their prayers expressed in public. We can count on spiritual affections in the saints -- they are there. It would be good for each to come having asked in their chamber beforehand for an impression of Christ they never had before. I know next to nothing of Him, He is so great -- I say honestly. Why, He is infinitely great! If there is joy over a sinner repenting, do you not think there is greater joy to God to hear a saint pray for a greater and deeper impression of Christ? There is something far better than ministry. It is better than ministry to get the presence of Christ. He is greater than ministry. He is greater in Himself than all the ministry of the apostles.
Ques. "He was manifested in another form ... to them" (@Mark 16: 12). Would that be it?
C.A.C. Yes, worshipping is as He is present. They
{244}
brought forth the king's son and crowned him. This chapter is one of the most beautiful scriptures in the Old Testament applying to the present time. We are getting it now beforehand. The greatest thought of all is the knowledge of the king's son.

MINISTRY ON NEHEMIAH
{246}
{247}
FROM C.A.C.S NOTES
@Nehemiah 2: 1 - 20
The place of Artaxerxes in @Nehemiah 2 is that of one on whom Nehemiah was dependent for all that he desired to do for Jerusalem. So that he appears to represent divine actings providing for the city and its wall being built. He only appears in this chapter and in a brief mention in chapter 13, God providing but using a Persian king as acting on His behalf. He was a king set up by God and every such king in some sense represents divine authority. I think the teaching of it for us is that in a day of departure and ruin we must have divine authority for what we do.
Nehemiah's desire was to have written authority, and the reference to every scripture being divinely inspired in @2 Timothy 3 would correspond in our circumstances. Nehemiah introduces himself as the king's cupbearer. His office was to minister to the king's pleasure. Note the references in 2 Timothy: "Strive diligently to present thyself approved to God"; "He shall be a vessel to honour, sanctified, serviceable to the Master"; "A bondman of the Lord"; "The man of God". The one who will be serviceable in a day of ruin must be characterised thus. And he will be a sad man, spiritually sad, because he is thinking of the ruin of God's city and its walls and gates. Nehemiah had not been thus before; it was a new exercise to him. Perhaps it is new to many of us, but we shall not serve God's interests if we do not take it up. Nehemiah had a good reason to be sad, and we have more reason, for the ruin is more terrible today than it was then, because the thing ruined was so much more beautiful and glorious in its original state.
Nehemiah was not content to be a sad mourner over the
{248}
ruins. There are many such today. They grieve over what they see and hear, but they do nothing. Nehemiah made request that he might be sent "that I may build it".
Then there must be material for building. I think this would be what is in Christ Jesus (2 Timothy). Faithful men. Those pursuing righteousness, faith, love, peace, calling on the Lord out of a pure heart.
The captains of a force of horsemen would now be spiritual power. "Power and love and wise discretion". "Strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus".
But we find opposition -- men grieved that the welfare of the children of Israel should be sought. Nehemiah keeps his exercises to himself. He goes out by the valley-gate, which suggests a lowly spirit, a spirit of meekness.
Jackal-fountain -- or dragon well -- suggests an evil power which has been working, a spring of evil teaching, perhaps, like Hymenaeus or Philetus in @2 Timothy 2: 17, 18. The dung-gate would speak of all that flesh could boast in being carried out (@Philippians 3).
The fountain-gate and the king's pool seem to suggest supplies of refreshment formerly known but now inaccessible. The fountain-gate is near Siloam (chapter 3: 15) and the king's garden.
The first thing is to see the extent of the ruin privately, but to go out and come in by the valley-gate. Paul goes out by the valley-gate to see the ruin at Corinth. "Out of much tribulation and distress of heart I wrote to you, with many tears". "And now tell you even weeping".
John, before writing to the assemblies, has to fall at His feet as dead. The jackal-fountain or dragon well would have reference to evil teaching -- no resurrection of the dead, the teachings of men and law teaching; that woman Jezebel; the doctrine of Balaam, of Nicolaitanes, many antichrists, etc. They have to be driven out; they are all in Scripture. The dung-gate is the absolute rejection of what might be a gain to us according to flesh (@Philippians 3).
{249}
The fountain-gate is full of beautiful suggestions (chapter 3: 15). Siloam is the prophetic word which speaks of Immanuel, God with His people. The Lord sent the blind man there and he came seeing. The king's garden would intimate that the fountain ministers to fruitfulness for the king, and the stairs go down from the city of David at that point from Zion, all that God has set up in grace and power being in Christ.
It seems to suggest that there is an ascent from near the fountain-gate and the king's garden to mount Zion. It is necessary to take account of all that has been rendered unavailable. Zion is resurrection at the present time.
FROM C.A.C.S NOTES
@Nehemiah 2: 1 - 20
The building of the sheep-gate was by the priestly family, and it is the only gate that is said to be hallowed. The sheep-gate would stand in relation to election and the sovereign work of God in His saints. It suggests that we come into God's city by His sovereign call -- saints by calling, as we see in Romans, 1 Corinthians and Thessalonians.
This gate is hallowed; that is, it regards the saints as apart from sinful flesh and characterised by the work of God. It is, speaking generally, how John regards the sheep. They are seen as belonging to the Father and given by Him to the Shepherd Son, so that none perish, but have life eternal. To view the saints as born of God is a very holy view of them: they are, indeed, hallowed. Nothing could give a more intense thought of the holiness of the city than to see that we can only enter into it as the sheep of Christ.
Then the fish-gate speaks of the saints as having had a history in the world but as having been caught in a divine net and secured for God. It looks at what is secured by human
{250}
instrumentality. It is men who let down the net and who bring the catch to shore, and who select the good fish to be put in vessels. It is the kingdom side in which responsibility has place, and the labour of men in preaching. The net broke in @Luke 5 but it did not break in @John 21.
We only find six gates built or repaired, which would suggest, perhaps, that the complete idea of administration can hardly be set up in a day of recovery. The principle is set up but with certain limitations. It is rather the power of the thing as made good without assuming to have more than is consistent with a day of remnant conditions. The assembly as the city takes character from its gates. "Each one of the gates, respectively, was of one pearl" (@Revelation 21: 21); whichever way you approach you get an impression of what the assembly is to Christ as the "one pearl".
In approaching the city of God we get certain impressions at the gates, and we only go into the city as we take up these impressions. People who wash their robes can come in by the gates into the city.
The first gate is the sheep-gate. This is peculiarly John's teaching. The first thought the Lord suggested to His disciples was that He would make them fishers of men. The fisherman would be responsible to see that they had fins and scales -- the principle of selection (@Matthew 13). Skill and care are required.
The gate of the old wall would indicate that God's ancient principle of separation from evil must be owned as characteristic of His city. Abraham was called out from country, kindred and father's house. Israel was to be a peculiar people (@Psalm 1).
Then the valley-gate is the poor in spirit. "Learn from me" -- a broken and contrite heart, a broken spirit, trembling at God's word-converted and blessed as little children.
The dung-gate is seen in @Philippians 3.
The fountain-gate speaks of spiritual privilege, so it is covered, suggesting that we come now to what is known privately to lovers of Christ.
{251}
The building and repairing consist in setting up; then it is evident that they become available after being burned with fire.
REBUILDING THE WALL
@Nehemiah 3: 1 - 32
C.A.C. We should find it very helpful to think of the general principles set forth in the building of the wall; it has a special relation to our own time. We are living in a time when what is of God is broken down and there is an opportunity for all those who love God to come forward to build up that which has been broken down. The wall obviously suggests the thought of what is external.
Ques. Has the building of the wall in view God's dwelling-place?
C.A.C. Yes. The book of Ezra gives us the altar and the building of the house. That is evidently internal. In contradistinction with that, the wall is external, for the protection and security of what is inside.
Having read Ezra we understand that what is in the mind of God is that we should approach and serve in His house acceptably to Himself. We can all see that that is inward and spiritual, but it requires to be safeguarded by outward conditions which are suitable to the protection and preservation of it.
None of the service in this chapter is by commandment, it is all a question of what is voluntary, what proceeds from the heart of each one. It is not here a service appointed to us by the Lord, but a service to which we appoint ourselves. It is on the line of what is said of the house of Stephanas in the last chapter of 1 Corinthians. Paul says of them that they "devoted themselves to the saints for service". J.N.D. calls attention in the note to the fact that the word used is of an officer to a regiment. That is what the Lord likes -- they
{252}
appointed themselves. It is an official appointment, an appointment of love brought about by their own care for the welfare of the saints.
The fellowship means that all must work together. We set to work together on the same piece of work as the saints all over the world; a piece of work that is entirely in keeping with the mind of God. I believe that lack of fellowship is universally felt by Christians who have any love for the Lord. What God is doing is building the wall of Jerusalem, and we want to do what God is doing. In this chapter what they were doing was in perfect harmony with the mind of God. Nehemiah surveyed the ruin and then he spoke to the brethren so that they all moved to come forward to the work.
Ques. Would the building and repairing necessarily involve separation?
C.A.C. Yes, there is nothing much more separating than a wall. It sets up a distinct line of demarcation between what is inside and outside.
Ques. What is the separation from and what to?
C.A.C. I think it is the great principle set out in 1 Corinthians, where you find there are persons in every place who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. What a wonderful thing that is! God does not contemplate any believer being outside that. The epistle is addressed "to the assembly of God which is in Corinth ... with all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ". Think of companies of persons in every place calling on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; there is a conscious link with the Lord Jesus Christ in heaven. Is not that wonderful? That is the character of the fellowship. No one can call on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and go on with what is contrary to Him; the thing is morally impossible. That is the real character of the fellowship -- persons who are in absolute unity of thought, purpose and desire because all are calling on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. That is what
{253}
is so ruined today. There is no divine fellowship outside the footing of calling on the Lord out of a pure heart. The initial thought in Corinthians was all those who call on the name of the Lord Jesus, that was what constituted the fellowship when Paul wrote to the Corinthians. In the last days when departure has come in and the wall is entirely brought down, the Lord looks for persons who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. Those are the people who constitute the fellowship. In principle it takes in all saints, but the majority of believers are uninterested, like the nobles of Tekoa, who put not their necks to the work of the Lord (verse 5). We do not want to be like that.
The apostle and Timothy and a few others in Corinth were working at the work of the Lord, and the apostle admonishes all to be at it. "Be firm, immovable, abounding always in the work of the Lord". He stirred them all up to be builders. Every one of us can do something to further this great fellowship which is of God, and we can do something to hinder it too. In Nehemiah they were all doing something to help in it. What is of God must necessarily preserve from what is of man. The building is building up what is of God.
It appears that every trace of the fish-gate and sheep-gate had gone, but in other cases it is evident that all was not quite gone, but needed repairing.
The wall in the heavenly city is of jasper. That is like God, because God is seen in @Revelation 4 and His glory has the character of jasper. What is of God goes into the wall and shuts out what is of man.
All our intercourse together either helps or hinders the fellowship. When two brothers or two sisters meet, they either help or hinder the fellowship by what they say. We should be able to say something to each other, for we are working on the biggest thing on earth. One wishes one had a deeper sense of the necessity of going on with the work of the Lord always. It is not a spasmodic thing, but a life work. If it is not that, what is it? Paul said of Timothy, "He works the work of
{254}
the Lord, even as I". It is open to each of us to work the work of the Lord. It is not a question of gift or special ability, but it is a question of whether we love it. The fellowship is the great thing; God has called us to the fellowship of His Son.
Ques. What are the angles?
C.A.C. Certain salient points in the wall that require special attention. It is a wonderful thing that all these different men and women so worked together that there was not any discrepancy at any point. You have to be ready for turns in the wall; that is very important. You have to move in keeping with the exercises of the brethren all the world over. There are no such things as local customs; they are altogether out of keeping with the fellowship. The apostle says, "*We* have no such custom, nor the assemblies of God". Sometimes we have to make a change in our customs; the Lord gives more light as to things, and we have to learn to turn a corner. Sometimes people fall overboard at a corner. In the fellowship we have to learn to regard the exercises of the brethren all over the world, and regard the ministry the Lord has given in all parts of the world; it is all connected with the greatest thing on earth.
We must work on what is nearest to us; they built over against their own houses. The first thing a man wants is his house in fellowship. You do not expect to find ungodly people in the saints houses, or worldly books, or wireless sets. If your house is not in fellowship it is a poor thing. Every believer's house should be a suitable place for the assembly to meet in; if our houses are not that, there is something wrong in them.
Pursuing on this line does not allow for special friends -- certain ones found in your house and others never. Special friends and cliques with certain people are the ruin of the fellowship. The universal thought is that all the brethren are in your mind in the wonderful bond of the fellowship.
Ques. What about the towers?
C.A.C. There is something distinctive in that. There is
{255}
the tower of the furnaces; I suppose that stands connected with the fellowship very distinctly and it reminds us that in the fellowship the Lord maintains His own rights in judgment. If we disregard His rights in love we may expect to come under His judgment.
At Corinth they ate the Lord's supper carelessly, and there were many sick and dying among them. That was the direct judgment of the Lord, and He has not changed His mind about these things. That is in keeping with the tower of the furnaces. What is nearest to the Lord is what He is most particular about. The Lord may allow things to go on in the sects without taking any notice, but He comes down on us very hardly sometimes. The Lord maintains His right in judgment, and no one who loves Him would like Him to do anything else. All Christians love the thought of the judgment-seat of Christ, every Christian who has the character of a Christian loves that thought. Is there one here tonight who would not like to have the Lord's judgment about every mistake he has made? I would. What greater proof is there of favour? The Lord tells us of things that happened fifty years ago sometimes. Paul spoke of things being made manifest to God. Often a saint passes before the Lord's scrutiny before leaving this world; that is the normal thing. One often notices with dying saints that there is a time when they are not bright. They are standing, as it were, at the judgment-seat, and the Lord is saying things to them He does not say to anyone else. With the ungodly their judgment comes after death. If we walk in the fellowship we judge ourselves, and ask the Lord to give us His mind. It can be done in a very short time, for much goes through the mind in a few minutes. The judgment session is soon over, but it is very effectively done. The tower of the furnaces has a good deal to say to us. We are not to suffer sin on our brother; I am responsible not to let sin on a brother pass. We often see people going wrong and do not tell them of it. All this stands in relation to the fellowship. If I suffer sin on my brother I am a traitor to the
{256}
fellowship. The Lord would not let things run on unsettled for weeks, months and years; that is destructive of christian building. It is pulling the wall down, not building it up. This all has to do with the tower of the furnaces. What is wrong is not allowed to pass, but is put in the crucible.
FROM C.A.C.S NOTES
@Nehemiah 3: 1 - 32
Fifteen times we get "next to him", sixteen times "after him" or "them", all indicating that there were no gaps left.
The unbroken continuity of the wall was maintained. The true character of the fellowship has to be maintained by each partner.
The nobles of Tekoa "put not their necks to the work of their Lord". They did not put their backs into it, as we say.
The Tekoites repaired a second piece to make up for their laziness.
We find "goldsmiths", and "perfumers", and "daughters", and "dealers", showing that persons not very fit, as we should judge, took a hand in the work. Perhaps God values most what is done by persons who feel very unfit for the work. Some feel they have no ability, no gift, but if their hearts move them they can do something. The Lord takes on eleventh-hour men. Can any of us say we have no part in the work?
Two men are mentioned as being rulers of the half part of Jerusalem; one repaired even over against his house (verse 10); Hasshub repaired a second piece (verse 11); Ezer also repaired a second piece (verse 19); two repaired over against their houses (verse 23); another "by his house" (verse 23); the priests "every one over against his house" (verse 28); another "over against his house" (verse 29); two others "a second piece" (verse 30); Meshullam
{257}
"over against his chamber" (verse 30); four did a second piece.
The building of the wall would obviously suggest what is external -- an aspect of things which can be taken account of publicly, but which becomes the security of what is within. The gates set forth the principles which are necessary for entrance and the privileges of those who enter. But the wall is the work of the Lord as it is carried on by His people to secure what stands distinctively for God in the presence of all that is contrary to it. So that it answers to the setting up of the principles of the fellowship. "Now if Timotheus come, see ... for he works the work of the Lord even as I" (@1 Corinthians 16: 10). "Abounding always in the work of the Lord" (@1 Corinthians 15: 58). The assembly of God in Corinth, "With all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ" (chapter 1: 2). That is the great mark of what is for God in any place. That is a personal, conscious link with the Lord Jesus Christ. Then, God has called us "into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord". God has called us to be inside that enclosure, the fellowship of the blood of the Christ and of His body. We are all one body as partaking. There is only one will now. Satan has been working to break down that distinctive fellowship, but the work of the Lord is to build it up. There is to be no breach in the wall. It depends upon each individual being true to the fellowship. It is not in @Nehemiah 3 that the Lord appoints, but that each one comes forward to do his bit, and it is all co-ordinated under the Lord so that there is no overlapping and no gaps; like the house of Stephanas.
In @Nehemiah 3 it is the fellowship seen in relation to the work of the Lord. Not gospel work here, but such a sense of the value of God's city that we want every element of the world shut out and kept out, for there is really nothing in common between the two.
The wall of the city was jasper, like the One who sat on the throne. The wall suggests the thought of the one universal
{258}
fellowship, but views it as exclusive of all human associations. You come to fixed boundaries. There are no divinely fixed boundaries except the fellowship, so it is a great thing to have these set up by saints, for here it is what saints do.
Each one had to build in line with many others. The fellowship is universal: we have to build in line with brethren all over the world. So that we do not want local customs. Paul appeals to the customs of the assemblies of God. It is possible for saints all over the world to walk together in the same fellowship with the same customs. So that what is of God comes into view -- God amongst His people. Something brought in to shut out the human mind by bringing in what is of God. Our houses are to be in the fellowship. "The assembly which is in thine house". We do not expect to find worldly people in the houses of the saints; or worldly books; or wireless. Every sect would hinder the work of God for He has the thought of the one fellowship before Him. Do not get narrowed up to a small number of the saints. If I were able to do much entertaining, I should like to have them all.
The Lord would have each one to feel, 'I am engaged in a world-wide work' -- the greatest thing on earth, as Jerusalem was to those who loved God. True saints meet together with a sense that they belong to the greatest thing on earth!
"Build the walls of Jerusalem" (@Psalm 51).
FROM C.A.C.S NOTES
@Nehemiah 3: 6 - 15
"The gate of the old wall", "the valley-gate", "the dung-gate" and "the fountain-gate" are said to be "repaired". The last three are also said to be "built". A good deal of what is going on today is repairing work: there is something left of the original thing but it has been so damaged that it needs repairing. There is danger of slipping away from what
{259}
we have heard (@Hebrews 2). Peter stirs up pure minds by way of remembrance -- 2 Peter particularly -- and all the later epistles (see preface to Darby Translation). We are all very dependent on ministry in the work of the saints.
"The old wall" would refer spiritually to the principle of separation which has marked the saints from the beginning. It is said of Enoch and Noah before the flood that they walked with God. Then Abram was called out. Israel was a separate people. The Psalms show the principle of separation, even in Israel, of the godly. In remnant times those who feared Jehovah spoke often one to another.
Difference between clean and unclean -- "Come out" -- no spot of the world (2 Timothy).
"The valley-gate" -- the Lord came in by the valley-gate in His blessed humiliation. He became poor. "Learn from me". He came in by the manger and went out by the cross. The meekness and gentleness of the Christ! "With all lowliness and meekness" -- bearing His reproach, yieldingness, suffering.
"The dung-gate" would evidently be found in @Philippians 3, as "the valley-gate" is in chapter 2. It is also seen in principle in Galatians. Peter had to learn to make use of it as to his reputation as a Jew.
But all is leading up to "the fountain-gate" which speaks, I think, of the positive spiritual gain which marks the fellowship. It is the only gate which is said to be "covered", which would suggest that what pertains to it is not a public matter. It is known only to those who enter. It has to do with what can only be known by the Spirit (spiritual persons), so that spirituality is essential when we come to this gate. The three previous gates would secure spiritual conditions and prepare for the fountain-gate. If we have not the fountain-gate repaired and built we shall become formal and orthodox.
"The pool of Shelah" (Siloam) would typify ministry sent by the Lord, a ministry of Himself. We have to wash in the ministry of the word which when applied gives clear vision of Christ. The man in @John 9 illustrates this.
{260}
Then "the king's garden". "A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse" (@Song of Songs 4: 12). "Blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow forth" (verse 16). "I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse" (@Song of Songs 5: 1). "My beloved is gone down into his garden" (@Song of Songs 6: 2). It is a beautiful figure of what the Lord finds in the assembly as having the features of His sister, His spouse.
It is not union but the saints as having qualities that are suitable for union. The Lord saw such qualities in John, Peter ("If it be thou ...", @Matthew 14: 28), Thomas ("Let us also go ...", @John 11: 16), Mary of Bethany, Mary Magdalene and others. All that has passed in the week enters into this when we come together. It is what the saints are actually in their walk and spirit and affection.
'That one spoke of Me to one for whom I died. That one wrote a letter to comfort one in sorrow; that one found pleasure in reading My words or what My servants said of Me. That one bore reproach for Me at school, or in the workshop. That one left friends and relatives to be true to My name'. And so we might go on. 'That one gave five shillings to one of My poor saints when she could ill afford it'. There are 59 hymns written by sisters -- one-sixth of the 1932 hymn book.
Then, "The stairs that go down from the city of David". When they came to be used in chapter 12, they went up them. The city of David represents for us what stands in the power of resurrection. @Acts 13 suggests this. The stairs are the connecting link between what belongs to the fellowship here and what is to be known in the resurrection position. The latter is purely spiritual for we are not actually risen. We go up to what pertains to Christ as risen. Can Zion or "the city of David" be limited to resurrection or does it go on to the heavenly? The city of David would represent the assembly as standing in relation to Christ as not known in the flesh. @Matthew 16, "I will build". There is a spiritual position taken up by faith in Colossians and necessitating divine quickening as in Colossians and Ephesians to occupy it.
{261}
FROM C.A.C.S NOTES
@Nehemiah 4: 1 - 23; @Nehemiah 5: 1 - 19
If we do anything to set up the principles of fellowship the enemy will be sure to reproach us with weakness, but the answer to this is to go on with the work. The wall is one whole. "The people had a mind to work".
Then there is active opposition which has to be met by prayer and watchfulness, and at the same time strength fails in presence of much rubbish. It seems important to get rid of the rubbish, for it has been accumulating all through the history of the church. "Rubbish" is not living material; it is what has been handed down in a traditional way, what is not in faith. We must expect to be attacked. We must never be without our weapons. A people really set to maintain what is due to Christ as Lord, and to be true to the fellowship will be attacked. Having weapons means that we bring the truth to bear on those who attack us. We do not get out of things merely on the principle of saying nothing, or of avoiding a battle. Many a person has been secured for the fellowship by a very few faithful words. Now we are never to be unarmed: I am afraid we are often caught unawares.
Then there may be an attack which requires all the forces: when the trumpet is sounded it is to rally all. Something contrary to the fellowship has to be met at some one point, but it affects all. The work is great and extended, and the soldiers widely scattered, but when the trumpet sounds all assemble to meet the attack. It is one body universally, as in 1 Corinthians. The wall is completely broken down if we think that we are only responsible for ourselves or for what happens in our own meeting. Satan is always seeking to narrow us up.
Then in chapter 5 we find a destructive influence acting within. That is, persons seeking their own advantage at the expense of their brethren.
The house of God is not the place to hide oneself in from
{262}
the conflicts of the testimony. People often use pious language, but it puts fear into hearts as to being identified with the testimony. It was not fitting to the moment to flee, or to the man. "Who is there, that, being as I am, could go into the temple, and live" (chapter 6: 11). To give up the truth would be to die. A great many are kept out of the enjoyment of assembly truth by fear. They say, what conflicts, what controversies, what difficulties, what divisions! So they give up the wall, and the enemy comes in and takes away all that is distinctive of the testimony, and it will not be long before all the principles of the world will come in and swamp what is of God in relation to the truth of the assembly.
There are many prophets today seeking to put the saints in fear of standing for the truth.
Then there were traitors keeping up communications with Tobijah and speaking of his good deeds and reporting Nehemiah's matters to him.
FROM C.A.C.S NOTES
@Nehemiah 4: 1 - 23; @Nehemiah 6: 1 - 19
Sanballat and company represent those who would keep up the existing state of things. They are grieved that a man should come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel. They first mock and seek to despise what was being done (chapter 4). Then they fight against those that built the wall. Then when the wall was built they propose a conference (chapter 6). The doors were not yet set up. The principles of fellowship may be accepted in a general way but not adhered to very strictly. There is a readiness to want liberty to do this or that which really means going outside the wall. Links are kept up by means of relatives or friends with what lowers the
{263}
whole tone of separation. Often books are read which bring the very spirit and atmosphere of what exists in the great profession into the mind and heart. Then there is an opening for this proposal to come together on some principle which is not that of the christian fellowship, all kinds of conferences, conventions, alliances, united prayer meetings. But all this means leaving the work. The object is to do mischief and take us away from what is really of God.
Then there is an attempt to make out that there is a rebellion afoot, and that it will be reported to the king. This corresponds with charges of evil doctrine. People are writing books and pamphlets all the time, circulating charges of rebellion, and of setting up what is lawless. What is according to God will always seem lawless to those who want to maintain things as they are. But all this is to make afraid and to slacken the hands of those who are doing the work. Nehemiah prays, "Now therefore strengthen my hands!" (chapter 6: 9).
But from @Nehemiah 6: 10 it is a more subtle working within. Here is a man who had shut himself up; that is, he is not going on happily with the brethren; he has a private line of his own in ministry, but it is now a question of prophecy (verse 12). It is now a spiritual snare; he pretends to have a word from God, and to call Nehemiah to meet in the house of God, within the temple, and to shut the doors. It did not sound like the enemy's voice, but it was. This man, not really with the brethren, would have put Nehemiah in fear. If the leader could be intimidated, and made to show publicly that he was afraid, in that he hid himself in the house of God to save his own life, it would be sin on his part and they could spread an evil report and reproach him. Satan does not care whether it is the plain of Ono (verse 2) or the house of God (verse 10) if he can get us away from the work. The Pharisees said, "Get out, and go hence, for Herod is desirous to kill thee" (@Luke 13: 31). Timothy is told that God has not given us the spirit of cowardice.
{264}
THE WALL AND THE TABLE
@Nehemiah 5: 14 - 19; @Nehemiah 6: 1 - 14
Ques. Would you help us as to the meaning of verse 14 of chapter 5?
C.A.C. Nehemiah not only suggests what is right, but he is the personal expression of it. It brings out the great principle that if we see a fault in the saints the thing is to rebuke it by our own example. This terrible state of selfishness had come in, and to rebuke it Nehemiah would not take the bread he was entitled to.
It is very important that the food supply should be kept up; everything of God will fail if there is not the food supply.
Ques. Would you tell us the difference between building the wall and this food supply?
C.A.C. I thought it was necessary that for any true building there must be feeding. For the carrying on of what is connected with the testimony of God and the truth of the fellowship we must have a good food supply. The reason why so many saints are not prepared for the path of separation is that they are not furnished with food. We ought all to be exercised to be sources of supply, not making demands on the saints. The spirit of demand is so natural to us, the spirit of supply is spiritual. Love would make us sources of supply so that we do not come to the meetings first of all for what we can get, but what we can bring. Paul had to say from the beginning, "All seek their own things, not the things of Jesus Christ". That has been a blight from the beginning of the church.
The fellowship in the first place is a fellowship of satisfaction; that is the great thought of it, and it is only as we are in the fellowship of satisfaction that we can be vigorous in the fellowship of separation. One ox, six choice sheep, fowls of all sorts and wine in abundance suggest a very satisfying
{265}
menu; it evidently suggests a peace-offering character of things. Our right in the fellowship and testimony all depends on our having part in the peace-offering. Every element of selfishness is a destruction of the fellowship. The first disturbing element in Acts was that the Greeks (Hellenists) complained that their widows were neglected. It was the first rift in the fellowship. The Spirit of God does not tell us whether they were right or wrong in complaining, but the fact that such a question arose was a rift in the fellowship. It is a great necessity for us to keep up the feeding that constitutes the peace-offering. It is a continuous thing -- the appropriation of the interests of Christ.
The peculiar feature of the peace-offering was that it was enjoyed together in communion. God had His portion; the priests had their portion; and the people had their portion. It is a great type in the Old Testament of the fellowship on the satisfaction side. It is the support of life in view of fellowship and the testimony of God. None of us is in the fellowship except in the life of Christ. There is no such thing as being in fellowship in the flesh, but only in the life of Christ, and that life needs to be sustained. Christ is our life. We all recognise that as Christians, but that life, speaking in a practical sense, may be very feeble if not sustained by food. This links on with the thought that Nehemiah had, for he was not only concerned about building the wall but that there might be strength to build it. Who can take up the fellowship without spiritual strength? The fellowship is work for *men*, not babes. There must be spiritual vigour, and that only comes about by living on spiritual food, namely, the personal and private occupation with that new kind of life that has come into the world in the Person of Christ. It is open to us all to spend our private life in considering that life which has come in in Christ, and to keep before us steadily all the time, 'That is my life'. As we feed on that in secret we have something to bring to the meetings. The tent of meeting and the altar represent what is public in the gathering together of the
{266}
saints. We should all come to bring, not only to get. The whole of Scripture is a presentation of Christ; a spiritually rich man is one who gathers it up. Nehemiah represents a rich man, and, thank God, we come into contact with brothers and sisters with spiritual wealth; they can bring before us impressions of Christ by their character and ways. All that becomes food supply for us so that there is no hardship in being separated from man after the flesh.
We cannot have the wall without the table. Nehemiah is a model for us. He is not a type of Christ, but of a faithful man. We can all aspire to be faithful. Few have much in the way of gift, but Timothy was to commit things to "faithful men". We can all aspire to that.
It is good for us to take in this thought of the food supply as running alongside of the building of the wall. If it is not a matter of life with us, our separation from the systems of men is nothing but pharisaism. All these exercises are not matters reached once for all; they have to be maintained right through. We only come into the fellowship in the life of Christ. It is good for us all to put that down as a fixed principle. It is in the life of obedience, dependence, separation from the world and judging every movement of the flesh in us that we build the wall.
We cause it to appear that saints are definitely marked off from the world in every aspect; that is the thought in building the wall. There is to be no breach in the wall. In this chapter the wall was completed without a breach; it was all there in completion though the doors were not set up. Many of us accept the truth of the fellowship in a general way without always being true to it personally; it is not observed strictly. If the doors are not there there is a certain liberty. You may go out now and then if there is no door. The general principles of fellowship are accepted often, but they are not always carried out strictly. For instance, if one goes for a holiday where there is no meeting, and turn into some little chapel, there is no door! A remark of F.E.R.s helped me: 'All the principles of fellowship are not to be applied in the
{267}
judgment of others, but reflectively. We define the position for ourselves and then we are true to it'. If we only come into things by force of circumstances, we have not defined the position for ourselves. We need to apply these things to ourselves. People plead sometimes for liberty, but to have no doors is a principle of lawlessness. Have we defined the fellowship for ourselves, definitely committed ourselves to it so that we do not entertain the thought of wanting liberty for anything else? Every looseness in the fellowship indicates we are not moving in the life of Christ but in the flesh, and that is abhorrent to God.
Sanballat and Tobijah represent people who want to maintain things as they are -- what exists in the religious world. They poured scorn and contempt on the builders first and, when the work goes on in spite of them, they propose a conference to talk things over. That is the enemy's great device today. No young Christian will ever be satisfied to go into the religious world unless they are corrupted. Something comes in that is not of grace or divine teaching. If a young convert never moves away from divine teaching, he will never become entangled with things around him from which he needs to separate. The test is the ministry of Christ -- can you find it outside the wall? You cannot. You can find people who preach Jesus as Saviour, but where will you find a ministry of Christ, the Man who is entirely for God's pleasure? You find in christendom a very mixed condition of things, part good and part evil. What God is working for is for something to be set up that is distinctly of Himself, where there is no admixture of the will of man. Are we set for that? If not, we are not building the wall.
Nehemiah says to these people, I am doing a great work, why should I come down to you? We should all be conscious we are engaged in something very great and we cannot leave it or compromise. People may even charge us with rebellion. It is important that the young convert should have the sense that he is linked up with what is of God, so that he does not want to be linked up with what is of man.
{268}
From verse 10 we get a subtle working of the enemy -- persons nominally in fellowship. It is what is inside now; that is a serious thing. The man in verse 10 shuts himself up. He is not going on happily with his brethren, he has got a private line of his own. Men of that sort are a source of service to the enemy. He sets up to be a prophet, has a prophetic word, but it is all to intimidate the spiritual man and make him flee. It sounded all right what he said but we have to look out for men of that sort; they are more dangerous in one sense than Sanballat and Tobijah because these are outside, and they had this man in their pay. He was inside, but he was doing the devil's work.
FROM C.A.C.S NOTES
@Nehemiah 8: 1 - 18
It is after the wall is built, and the doors set up and watchfulness maintained to preserve what has been recovered, that the Scriptures get their place, as in @Nehemiah 8. The Scriptures cannot be read with understanding where the principle of separation from iniquity is not obeyed. A sect is, in its very nature, contrary to the truth: it is something less than the city of God, so that there cannot be any enlargement on sectarian grounds. We cannot use the word 'assembly' without thinking of one company. Indeed, all the words by which God has spoken to His people -- as saints, children, sons, flock, bride, body, temple, house, kingdom, assembly -- refuse to take on a sectarian character. It seems to me that the building of the wall means that the principle of unity is recognised, and it is felt to be necessary to secure it by separation from all that is contrary to it. It does not need an advanced stage of intelligence to see that the assembly is one company. We walk together as recognising that and we separate from what is contrary to it. Then the whole of Scripture can have its place:
{269}
it can all be accommodated within the wall. Many have been told when they have tried to bring Scripture into a sect, 'We do not want that teaching here'. There is not room for it there.
Every Christian should look out for a place where there is room for the Scriptures, where every scripture can be looked in the face. It is a characteristic feature of the great revival that saints come together to read the Scriptures with understanding. Outside that movement people are content that the clergyman or the minister should know; it is his business to know. But that another man knows is no gain to me; I only gain by what I understand myself. There were a number of other brethren always with Ezra; it was not a one-man matter.
The people wept when they heard the law. They felt how they came short of all that was presented. And that is how we feel always when we come under the power of Scripture. But God would not have us overwhelmed by the sense of our own failure when we read the Scriptures. They bring to us the knowledge of Himself so that whenever we read or hear the Scriptures the day is holy; this is said three times (verses 9, 10, 11).
FROM C.A.C.S NOTES
@Nehemiah 8: 1 - 18; @Nehemiah 10: 1 - 39
We see in Nehemiah how the exercise of the remnant deepens. The building of the wall was only a beginning. It is a great thing to set up in a practical way the principles which mark off the city of God from the world. This present evil world is that sphere where the will of man operates, whichever form it may take. It is a primary exercise to commit ourselves to the true character of the assembly as the city. It must be exclusive of the will of man. But that is only a
{270}
beginning. Chapter 8 is a great advance when Ezra and the Levites have their place. Then chapter 10 is a moral advance on chapter 8 for it is an adjustment of the spirit of the people in the light of all that Scripture presented to them. So that they come to it that there must be a definite commitment to the will of God, and this by sealing. This thought of sealing has a great place in Scripture. He that came received His testimony (see @John 3). We cannot go from it. Then God seals us. No person professing to believe should be content until he ensures that God has sealed him. But the sealing in @Nehemiah 9: 38 is typical of another sealing on our part. It is the intelligent commitment on the part of a separated and intelligent people (see chapter 10: 28) to walk in the will of God. It is well known in heaven how many have been sealed in this sense, so that we could not be persuaded to deviate from the will of God in any way. We will not form any link that is inconsistent with the testimony, and we will not allow anything to intrude upon what is due to the Lord, and we are prepared to maintain what is due to God even at some loss to ourselves as in the seventh year, such as servants who take less wages so as to serve the Lord. He approves of a man who shuts up his garage on the Lord's Day. Did you ever go to a meeting when it cost something, without getting a blessing?
Then they charged themselves with the service of the house: He looks for this. I believe the third part of a shekel was fixed to bring even the poorest into it. Do we all feel that we charge ourselves with it? The bread was to be set in rows, and the continual oblation with it. We ought all to feel that our contribution is in it.
But for the wood-offering it is a question of casting lots: why is this? The wood-offering was a matter of sovereign selection. It was special to remnant tittles as far as Scripture speaks. It is a provision for the burning on the altar: there could be no burnt-offering without it: but it is what we can provide. It is a feature of the burnt-offering which comes into prominence in remnant times, what may be sovereignly given in the assembly to promote worship. The wood as laid upon
{271}
Isaac would represent that Christ understood all that was involved in the burnt-offering. There was an order of man in Christ in which God could be glorified. I feel I want more light as to "the wood". It is not exactly the sacrifice but what makes the sacrifice possible. "The holy thing". Satan could not touch Him. It was humanity wholly for God. This is not exactly His person, for that must include His deity, but it is His greatness as Man.
In Leviticus it is the priests who have to do with the wood, not the offerer. It is a priestly apprehension of Christ. The offering is Christ, the offerer's measure of appreciation of Christ, but then it must be brought into connection with a priestly apprehension of Him before it goes up as sweet odour. A Man equal to the glory of heaven morally.
FROM C.A.C.S NOTES
@Nehemiah 11: 1 - 36; @Nehemiah 12: 1 - 47
In Nehemiah the city is prominent: it is twice in chapter 11 called "the holy city". This chapter is largely a list of those who dwelt in Jerusalem. The important matter in the mind of the Spirit was Jerusalem because the ark was (or had been) there. So these people cast lots that there should be a title to dwell there. There was an obligation, but those who willingly offered themselves were blessed by the people (chapter 11: 2).
It seems to me that the cities and their hamlets and dependent villages have reference to the saints as in their local position, but they were careful to maintain a link with Jerusalem. The unity of the remnant was secured by Jerusalem holding its place with each one. Those who serve in relation to what is universal are singled out and put on record in this chapter. Some are mentioned as having special offices: "overseers". "second over the city", "ruler of the house of God". Certain ones were "over the outward work of the
{272}
house of God" (chapter 11: 16). One was "the principal to begin the thanksgiving in prayer" (verse 17). One was "the second among his brethren" (verse 17). "The singers for the work of the house of God" (verse 22). One was "over the thanksgiving, he and his brethren". Some "to praise and to give thanks according to the commandment of David the man of God" (chapter 12: 24) and then "doorkeepers" (chapter 12: 25).
All were gathered for the dedication of the wall after providing for the service of the house of God. What are we to learn from this? Principles of separation do not get their true value until they are maintained in immediate connection with the service of God. It is easy to see that sects are wrong, that the clerical principle is wrong, that the mixing of believers with unbelievers in worship is wrong, that church and State should not be united, but if we do not have in mind the direct service of God in being separate, the wall is not dedicated. The two choirs compassed the whole wall. The wall was not to be exclusive only, every yard of it was to uphold something positive for the praise and glory of God.

CHRIST IN THE BOOK OF JOB (FROM C.A.C.S NOTES)
There are seven ways in which Christ is set forth in the ancient book of Job, and they are all ways in which we need to know Him.
<ol>
<li>The Offering: The Burnt-offering (chapter l: 5). </li>
<li>The Mediator: "There is not an umpire between us, who should lay his hand upon us both" (chapter 9: 33). "Oh that there were arbitration for a man with God, as a son of man for his friend!" (chapter 16: 21). </li>
<li>The Redeemer: "And as for me, I know that my Redeemer liveth, and the Last, he shall stand upon the earth" (chapter 19: 25). "Hearken unto me, Jacob, and thou Israel, my called. I am He; I, the first, and I, the last" (@Isaiah 48: 12). </li>
<li>The Wisdom of God: "But wisdom, where shall it be found?" (chapter 28: 12). </li>
<li>The Interpreter: "If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to skew unto man his duty" (chapter 33: 23). </li>
<li>The Ransom: "I have found a ransom" (chapter 33: 24). "And now, take for yourselves seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt-offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you, for him will I accept" (chapter 42: 8). </li>
<li>The Accepted Intercessor: Job himself becomes a type of Christ as the accepted Man who becomes the Intercessor for those who speak wrongly of God (chapter 42: 10). </li>
</ol>
The first is the burnt-offering. Job feared God and he had a sensitive conscience; and another thing, he knew what was in the heart of man. He knew there was great danger, especially in times of natural enjoyment, that something might be
{276}
in the heart of man that was sin before God. But he knew something else: he knew there was a way in which sin could be covered. God had made it known long before Job's day, and Job always had it in his mind (chapter 1: 5). So he offered burnt-offerings for his sons. A burnt-offering means that man cannot be accepted before God except on the ground of the death of Another. There has been one precious death in this world which has been such a sweet savour to God that it is a sure ground of acceptance for those who have sinned. We cannot be too simple about this. Never mix anything up with the death of Christ as the ground of your soul's rest. (A) man said, 'I am a believer, I was converted so many years ago, I came to Jesus'; at last he said, 'Christ died for me'.
But it is to be noticed that Job was thinking of his sons, not of himself. Many are like that: they are glad to hear of missionaries going to the heathen, or of people working in the slums to bring them to Christ. Job did not really stand in the value of the burnt-offering himself. He had to learn it by a long and bitter experience.
We know the history. He lost everything and his health, and he wished he had never been born. Two of his friends had given him some good advice, as friends are apt to do, but what they said did not comfort him. But it made him think of the greatness of God. He saw it was no use contending with God. God had made everything. And He was so holy that it was no use trying to cleanse himself. There was no one to come between such a God and such a creature. In the anguish of his heart he said, "There is not an umpire between us, who should lay his hand upon us both" (chapter 9: 33). The umpire is what is called in New Testament language the Mediator. The distance between God and man required an umpire. We cannot say there is no umpire now (@1 Timothy 2: 5,6).
Then in chapter 19: 25 Job utters one of the most triumphant notes of the book: "I know that my Redeemer liveth". This is what men need who are under death. You want One
{277}
who can redeem your soul from death. In fifty years time how many will be here who now live on the earth? (@Revelation 1). This brings us to the need of Christ as God's wisdom (chapter 28) to meet the whole condition as it exists. It is not found in the land of the living. Would this show the wisdom and wonder? Christ is the wisdom of God.
Now if there is a Burnt-offering, an Umpire, a living Redeemer, and Christ as the Wisdom of God, how does man come to the blessing bound up in Christ in this wondrous character? Chapter 33 supplies the answer: Christ is the Interpreter to show us the way into it. Repent, and believe the gospel. Uprightness is needed. See the different ways in which God speaks to man in this chapter. The Interpreter says, 'Now take God's side against yourself'. Say 'I have sinned'.
God has found a Ransom. He has a righteous way of freeing from the pit and from the power of him who is the angel of the bottomless pit.
Finally, Job himself becomes an expression of Christ as Intercessor and Advocate (chapter 42).
WHAT IS MAN?
@Job 15: 14 - 16; @Psalm 144: 3, 4; @Job 7: 17, 18; @Psalm 8: 4 - 9; @Hebrews 2: 5 - 10
One of the most important considerations in Scripture is the thought of what man is. It would not be too much to say that our knowledge of what God is is dependent on our knowing what man is. Our knowledge of God is largely dependent on our realising what man is as a fallen being, because his fall has brought out the character, nature and actings of God. So one of the greatest and most comprehensive questions in Scripture is, "What is man?"
{278}
There are two ways in which we may look at this. We may take up the thought of what man is in a merely orthodox way -- that is how Eliphaz the Temanite took it up. He says what is incontrovertible, but he does not bring out anything to touch one's heart in connection with the knowledge of God.
It is possible to take account of the state of man as a fallen sinner apart from the thoughts of God in regard to him, but this does not carry us beyond the range of the natural man. It is the goodness of God that leads man to repentance. It is possible to state the truth as to fallen man in an indisputable way, but if we leave out what God is for that man we have not gained much. Eliphaz says, "What is man, that he should be pure? and he that is born of a woman that he should be righteous? Behold, he putteth no trust in his holy ones, and the heavens are not pure in his sight: How much less the abominable and corrupt -- man, that drinketh unrighteousness like water!" It was very true and orthodox but it gave no impression of what God was in grace for such a man. Hence God had to say to Eliphaz at the end, "Mine anger is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends; for ye have not spoken rightly of me, like my servant Job" (@Job 42: 7).
Even men of the world may have a sense of the corruption in man. I believe it was Byron the poet who said, 'Who knows thee well, will quit thee with disgust, Degraded mass of animated dust'.
But that does not bring God in, and if we do not bring God in we have gained nothing. J.B.S. once said to me of a brother, 'He can knock the old man to pieces till there is not a bit left the size of a match, but he cannot bring Christ in'.
Men may state what man is as fallen in an orthodox way, as Eliphaz did, but there is no elevating power in that.
The great advantage of realising what a corrupt and fallen being man is, as descended from Adam, is that it provides an introduction to the blessed God which we never could have had in circumstances of innocence or righteousness. In speaking of man's abominable and filthy condition (verse 16)
{279}
Eliphaz was trying to strike a hard blow at Job, but it did not occur to him that this condition in man might be an outlet for what was in the heart of God. Augustine, speaking of the fall, called it a 'happy fault' because of what it had brought out in the heart of God. I wonder if each of us has realised that the fact that we are corrupt and abominable has put us in the position where we can learn God in a way that no unfallen being could ever learn Him? No man would seek to hide from himself the truth of his fallen condition if he could but see that that condition is his very opportunity to get to know God. Satan seeks to shut out the thought of God from the minds of men; he fills their minds with business, moneymaking and pleasures to keep God out; but if conscience awakes and moral thoughts do come in, Satan often presses on a man his terrible and sinful state to drive him to despair, and then he will tell him the only thing for him to do is to commit suicide. That is the devil's gospel.
@Psalm 144 brings to us the thoughts of faith. The psalmist sees the condition of man as God's opportunity; there is faith operative in him. Eliphaz was orthodox and sound as to the fall of man, but he did not bring God in for that man; the psalmist looks at man in vanity as an opportunity for God to take thought of him. In this psalm we get man as the subject of grace; God cares for him. What an impression of God it gives one! Even our badness and vileness have been God's opportunity, and He has cared for us; God has a creature He can make Himself known to. I like to think I am just the creature to whom God can make Himself known, and if He had not had such a creature He would have remained unknown. It needed me -- the filthy, abominable sinner -- to bring God into evidence in the truth of His character and nature. Being in that state I know God in a way that angels could not know Him. If angels get to know God it is by observing His ways with men; the saints are the lesson book of the angels, for angels cannot know in themselves the actings of grace.
{280}
When angels fell they fell finally and irretrievably; God did not let Himself out to angels, but He does to men. The things we deplore in ourselves are assets if we take them up rightly; they were the opportunity for God to come down. When Adam went out of the garden of Eden clothed with skins he went out morally greater than he was before the fall, because he had learned God in a way that he could never have known Him in innocence; he had learned how a sinful creature could be clothed and set up in suitability to God on the ground of the death of another. He had learned God as acting in righteous grace, and what a gain was this! Creature greatness lies in the knowledge of God. Our true greatness in the moral universe is in what we know of God, and we arrive at it through our sinnership.
We see in @Psalm 144 that the result of Jehovah coming down in saving and delivering power is unlimited blessing (see verses 12 - 15). That is the result of God being known as coming down in grace to act for His fallen creature. Man is vanity, nothing, but God is everything for him in grace. God takes thought of His ruined creature whose condition has provided Him with an opportunity to show His grace and favourableness.
In @Job 7: 17, 18 we see man as the subject of God's chastening. I think we should widen out our thoughts of God's chastening; we limit it sometimes to the people of God, but I think that *man* is the subject of God's chastening, and for this wonderful reason: "What is man, that thou *makest much of him*?" God makes much of man by chastening him; He has set His heart upon him (verse 17). How active God is in His chastening ways with men! (see @Job 33). The things which Job suffered are common to men; other people besides Christians have business losses, bereavements, sickness and sufferings. These are the kinds of chastening that come out in Job. Some chastening (as in Hebrews) is for sons; none have the peculiar sufferings of the path of faith but those who are in that faith; we can escape those chastenings if we are minded to do so, but there are many things that we cannot avoid.
{281}
Elihu mentions many things which God works with man. Why does God work with man? Because he has set His heart on him. Every bit of sorrow and trial that comes on an unconverted man is the chastening of God, and it is all in view of man's blessing. We should be able to interpret these things for men, but then we must first have the comfort of it ourselves. If God chastens me He is making much of me; He is taking infinite pains with me. He might leave His creatures to go their own way and not interfere with them, but He cares for them. When anything that is untoward happens we should think, 'The blessed God is making much of me!' We are apt to think, 'He is crushing me!' Job interprets the chastening ways of God as making much of man! If I get a stroke of chastening it turns my heart to God, and God says, 'Yes, that is what I want, I want you to think of *Me*'.
When an unconverted man is laid on a sick-bed God is making much of him. God has for the time put a stop to his money-making, his pleasures, his self-sufficiency; God is saying to him, I want you to think of Me, I have set My heart on you. What an inlet to the heart of God the thought of this gives! We ought to be God's interpreters, able to put men on the line of understanding God's chastening ways with them. I do not mean merely saying pious, sentimental things such as are current, but bringing in the true knowledge of God, first for ourselves and then for others. Our ability to do this just depends on how we know God. And if we had a right sense of what man is we should have a wonderful knowledge of what God is. God is all the time saying, 'I will do anything to get into your heart'. What a God He is!
Now if we understand what man is as the subject of grace and chastening, it prepares us to learn what man is as the subject of counsel, and that brings us to Christ. In @Psalm 8 we have the thought of divine complacency in man. God's grace and chastening show us the outgoings of the heart of God towards sinful man; but when the Son of man is brought in we get the thought of complacency. We come now to what lies behind all the actings of grace and the chastenings of
{282}
God. All these came in to transfer us in our affections from Adam to Christ.
The Son of man is Christ; God visits Him. He remembers the fallen man; there is a beautiful note to the word in the Darby translation, @Hebrews 2: 'An active recollection because the object is cared for'. But God has brought in the Son of man, One whom He can visit; He visits Him in the pleasure of complacency. God visited Him at His baptism, on the holy mount and in the grave when He raised Him from the dead. God has now a Man in whom He can be complacent, and He is going to give that Man universal supremacy. God is going to give Him all that Adam had in figure -- universal supremacy in this creation.
When we think of Christ as the answer to the question, "What is man?" we are lost in wonder. We are outside the state of ruin, vanity, failure, and are in the presence of a Man known from eternity, before the earth was, as the One who would bring about all God's purposes. It is wonderful to think there is a habitable part of the earth, habitable for God. The greater part of the earth at present is uninhabitable for God, but the habitable part is found in the assembly. There is a place where people can live in true relation with God. How can people live in selfishness, pleasure-seeking and money-getting? But there is a habitable place where the sons of men live who have learnt what it is to derive from Christ.
@Hebrews 2 gives us the habitable part of God's earth; it is an anticipation of the world to come. God has put it under a Man, and we see that Man; the centre is secured. We cannot yet see the circumference, but we can see the centre, and as brethren of Christ we stand in relation to the One who is the Centre of God's moral universe. In the brethren of Christ is being worked out in men the divine answer to the question, "What is man?" It has been worked out to finality in Christ, but it is being worked out with a view to finality in the saints. There is a worshipping company, a witnessing company, and
{283}
a waiting company. In that company we see a divine answer to the question, "What is man?" We have to reach up to the greatness of it.
We reach it by way of suffering. It must be so in a condition where sin and death have come in; glory can only be reached through suffering, and God's end for man is glory. The answer to the question, "What is man?" is found in Christ, where we see Man in the place of sonship, crowned with glory and honour, but He has come into that place through suffering and death. He has reached the place of divine purpose for man through suffering and death, and the many sons have to go the same way. It was as Leader of salvation that the Lord was made perfect. He has come into the place of inferiority to angels that He might die, and now He is Leader of salvation to a company of many sons, and in that company there is a divine answer to the question, "What is man?"
We are already brought to glory in a moral sense; we have not only to wait for a future day. We are brought in our affections to One crowned with glory and honour. Glory is the fruition of every divine thought, and God has reached it in Christ, and He is bringing us to it. We come short of glory in Adam, but through grace and as following the leadership of Christ we are brought to glory. Glory is God's thought for man; it is there we see the answer to the question, "What is man?" He is a vessel of divine glory. The way to glory is by the road of suffering; we cannot reach it any other way. I feel we know little of it because we have so little followed a suffering Christ.
Glory is the fruition of all the thoughts and purposes of God. If everything is brought to fruition as in the mind and heart of God, the word that describes it is glory. Some one said, 'Glory is the excellence of a thing in display'. When God gives fruition to all His thoughts and purposes of love it will be His own excellency in display; and man is the being who is the vessel of it.
{284}
ANOTHER MAN
@Job 42: 5, 6; @Psalm 41: 12, 13
Forty-one chapters of Job are taken up with the testing of the first man and it all ends in dust and ashes. Forty-one psalms are taken up with another Man -- His birth, life, sufferings and death -- and nothing could hinder Him from being set before God's face for ever! I wish to bring before you the great blessedness of the fact that we come before God and the Father in association with the One whom He set before His face for ever. What wonderful joy for us to know that through His death we are entitled to pass out of association with the man whose history ends in dust and ashes and to enter into association with the Man whom God has set before His face for ever! We are before God and the Father completely divested of the man that ends in dust and ashes and we are before Him in association with the Man whom He has set before His face for ever.
What a blessed transfer! May God give us to know more the power and the joy of it! Through the death of Christ we have the title to take our place in that new circle of divine affections where He lives before the Father's face. It is our joy and privilege to know that we are in association with Him in that circle in the assembly-completely free from the dust-and-ashes man.

{287}
A PERFECT WAY
@Psalm 18: 30, 32
The consciousness of the perfection of God's way has been one of faith's strongest supports in all ages. Nothing, indeed, could be more blessed and assuring for the heart than to have this consciousness. In a scene of desolation and death, where there is so much to cause exercise and grief, God's "hidden ones" find themselves sustained by the infinite comfort of this divine word, "As for God, his way is perfect".
Behind *everything* is the perfect way of our God. The starting-point of that "way" is the bosom of infinite love. The end of it is the blissful accomplishment in vessels of mercy of every thought conceived in that bosom. It is a way that leads to holiness and glory; in a word, to conformity to Christ. Are there sorrows that sorely test our hearts? Be assured that God intends every one of them to be a road for us to Christ, so that we may reach *Him* and learn *Him* in some character of His love and power that otherwise our souls had not known.
Nor does the comfort of this fail us on occasions when we are bowed in confusion of face because of failure that has brought us into deep sorrow and exercise. Not that the comfort in such cases is so direct and immediate, because God loves us too well to spare us the exercise needed to bring about true restoration and effectual deliverance from that which has been a snare to us. Indeed, we have to feel and own that it is in the perfection of God's way that we thus suffer and are exercised. But at the same time we realise that we have now come under the mighty hand of God for discipline, that we may be delivered from our own will and lusts, and, in result, exalted in the knowledge of Christ. And in this we see the perfection of God's way.
{288}
The real gain of chastening is that we are thereby turned to the Lord. If we do not reach the Lord there is no permanent transformation. So long as one is actually under pressure there is a certain repression of the flesh, but it asserts itself again as soon as the pressure is removed. But if the pressure brings about an exercise of soul in which we really turn to the Lord and reach Him, the effect of being in His presence is that we are "changed into the same image". There is not only repression, but transformation. We get something positively of Christ which *displaces* what is of the flesh.
It is the gracious thought of God to gird us with strength and make *our* way perfect. Nothing will really satisfy Him as to our way here but that we should walk before Him in a perfect way; that is, in perfect confidence in Himself, with not one misgiving thought as to His love.
In @John 11 -- that incomparable chapter -- we read that when Jesus had heard that Lazarus was sick, "He abode two days still in the same place where he was". Did this seem like the way of perfect love? Why did He not hasten to the side of His sick friend, to rebuke the disease and comfort the sorrowing sisters? Did He not well know how the delay must try them? The first words of Martha and Mary to Him show how fully they were assured that had He been there their brother had not died. They felt that He might have spared the wound had He chosen to do so. That there was holy submission, I doubt not, but His love had not acted as they expected.
How often is it thus with us! We count upon divine love to do for us according to our thoughts, and according to nature's estimate of things, and we find that He abides still. He allows the dreaded wave of sorrow to break over our spirits. It is well at such a moment to remember that "As for God, his way is perfect".
It was in the perfection of the divine way that Jesus "abode two days still in the same place where he was". His delay was not only for God's glory, and for His own glory, but it was for infinite blessing to Lazarus and Mary and Martha. It gave
{289}
occasion for Him to bring out before their hearts what He was in a way infinitely beyond all their expectations. It became the opportunity for them to discover the depths of His tender love and sympathy, and to know Him also as "the resurrection and the life". The Son of God was glorified before their eyes; they gained immeasurably in their knowledge of Him. They learned Him in presence of death and the grave as they could not have learned Him anywhere else. His way was perfect.
Nor do we need to leave this chapter to find a happy instance of a saint whose way was made perfect. "Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house". It was in God's perfect way that Jesus "abode two days still in the same place where he was", and I think Mary's way as a saint was made perfect when she "sat still in the house". Her soul was as a weaned child. The restlessness of nature, active in Martha, had no place with her. She would not move without His word, any more than He would move without His Father's word. In this we see a fine effect of her having sat at His feet and heard His word (@Luke 10: 39). She had been *formed* in His own company. He had girded her with strength in giving her the blessed knowledge of Himself and of the Father whom He was here to reveal. And in the strength of this knowledge she could be still and know that He was God. She could quiet herself in the confidence of His love at a time when every natural desire had been disappointed.
This is what we need. This girding with divine strength, the effect of nearness of heart to the Lord, alone can make *our* way perfect through a scene where every kind of heart testing comes upon us. Our strength is proved not so much by activity as by repose. Activity is often the relief of a restless spirit. It is a heart quiet, because girded with the strength of divine love, that can sit still and await the bidding of the Lord.
In due time, as the next chapter shows, Mary's way was as perfect in service as it had been perfect in sitting still in the house. She was so thoroughly in accord with the Lord that, at
{290}
the fitting moment, she could perform a service for which no other saint, so far as we know, was morally competent. She was girded with strength and her way was made perfect. Oh for more of that nearness to the Lord which would give us thus to walk in a perfect way, whether through sorrow or in service! A poet of the world has said, 'All great service flows from the centre of a quiet heart'. This witness is true.
GOD'S DWELLING-PLACE
@Psalm 27: 1 - 14
There are four things spoken of in this psalm: the house, the temple, the pavilion, and the tabernacle -- each suggesting its own peculiar blessing and each of the greatest importance to us as saints. We might say that all our blessing is covered by these four things. Sonship is connected with the house; priesthood is connected with the temple; salvation is connected with the pavilion; the privileges of the assembly are connected with the tabernacle.
It is an important question for each of us, What do we really desire and what are we seeking after? We might desire and seek after many things in this world and not get them, but in the divine and spiritual sphere we can have all we want. With spiritual desires there is always certainty of possession: "He satisfieth the longing soul". God proposes all the blessedness covered by these four things, and here is a soul ready to accept them. Are *we* prepared to accept them and go in for them with purpose of heart? "One thing have I desired" -- that is to have a definite object like Mary -- one thing is needful. It is wonderful how we get on when we become persons of one object. We have so many objects, seeking to gratify ourselves in some way or other, but, if the eye is single, the whole body is full of light.
{291}
In the *house* we come into the circle of divine affections. The thought covers the whole system of divine affections; the house is the place of privacy and affection. "The only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him". Think of one lying in the bosom of the Father in all His affections! That gives one an idea of the house; it is a circle of affection. We read in @John 8, the Son abides in the house ever -- it is the place of sonship. The servant comes in and out, but the son abides in the circle of affection, and we are called in to contemplate the perfect love of the Father to the Son and of the Son to the Father. All that love has acted for our blessing; it has manifested itself in grace. We are free to abide in the house in the spirit of sonship, in responsive affection to perfect divine love. The house is not only to be visited once or twice, but it is to be a dwelling-place. We are not free with God, we do not come into the house, until we are conscious of perfect divine love. It is the Son who brings us in; we have not earned or deserved anything -- that would be the thought of the hired servant -- but it is the Son who introduces us into the same relationship with Himself, as He said to Peter in @Matthew 17, "For me and thee".
The revelation has come to us of perfect divine affection. "The Father loves the Son", and He has put all His thoughts of divine grace into the hands of the Son to give effect to them; the Son has come to carry them out. "The glory which thou hast given me I have given them" -- that is sonship. Sonship is in the Son of God, and the glory of that relationship seen in a Man is given to us -- it is for us to seek to dwell in the region of these affections. The house is a restful place; when we get there we rest. What rest has come in for God in a blessed Man in this world! John bore witness that he had seen the Spirit abide upon Him as a dove. He had never found a resting-place before, but He could come and abide on Jesus. "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight". There is rest for the Spirit, and rest for the Father. That blessed One came here to bring us into His own place and
{292}
relationship with the Father. Do we believe it? I find it difficult to take it in, it is so amazing! Think of coming in to dwell in that circle of perfect and divine affections! Such blessedness throws everything else into the shade.
The house is the home of holy love, so the crown of it all is, "In my Father's house there are many abodes ... I go to prepare you a place ... I am coming again and shall receive you to myself, that where I am ye also may be" (@John 14: 2, 3). That is the consummation of the thought of the house.
"Grace reigns through righteousness" -- if we come under the reign of righteousness we have our fruit unto holiness, and that fits us for the house. The kingdom is the sphere of righteousness, and the house of holy love; the Lord would have us perfectly at home in the sphere of holy affections, loved by the Father and by the Son, set in the relationship of sons to the Father. How little we are ready to let it in and to be strengthened by the Spirit of the Father! All this issues in praise. What we see in the house, and learn in the temple and in the pavilion, prepares us for the tabernacle, which is the tent of meeting where all the saints come together. Every bit of divine blessing ought to fit us for coming together in the assembly.
The *temple* is the place of the holy oracles -- "To inquire of him in his temple". It is the place of divine enquiry; the holy oracles are there; we get God's mind there. Priesthood is connected with the temple. If one had a question, one could go to the temple and enquire, and get the hardest question solved by divine wisdom. That is the privilege of holy priests. Sons have the freedom of the house, but holy priests of the temple. The freedom of the temple is the privilege of spiritual persons. A priest is what the New Testament calls a spiritual man (@1 Corinthians 2: 15); he discerns all things; he is the man of vision.
In connection with the oracle it is the mind of God; not so much to find direction, but to see the mind of God. I should not go into the holiest to know where I am to live -- for that I can pray to the Father in the sense of His care and I can ask
{293}
and get wisdom. But wisdom connected with the temple is the light of God's mind, of the blessed sphere where all is filled with the glory and blessedness of divine thoughts. God would have us acquainted with His thoughts. We have His heart in His house, and His mind in the temple. The wonderful thing is that we have the divine glory there -- a Man is there who is equal to sustaining divine glory and giving effect to every thought in the divine mind. Scientific men for centuries have been investigating God's matters, seeking to look into His universe, but mind is greater than matter, and *we* are brought to look into God's mind.
We have minds as well as hearts. In 1 Corinthians it is a question of the mind -- "We have the mind of Christ", and there is the mind of the Spirit. In @Psalm 40 we see the immensity of divine thoughts -- "They cannot be reckoned up". All that is connected with the temple. If we were more exercised to know these thoughts, we should not crave for the literature of the world and say, I must have something to feed my mind -- as if God's things were only enough for the heart! We need to go and enquire in the temple. The devil often steals the saints hearts through their minds. There are many interesting and instructive things in the world, and while I am occupied with them I am missing heaps of pure gold, jewels of incorruptible value, which I might be picking up, but instead I am occupied with grains of sand or a few coppers. We want to see the incorruptible excellence of divine things. "How precious are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!" (@Psalm 139: 17). His thoughts cannot be reckoned up, they are more than can be numbered. We enquire in the temple as to all these thoughts. A divine Person came into manhood, and He can carry all these thoughts into effect. We find them in the temple and we can treasure them in our hearts.
In connection with this, one has often the feeling, These things are very precious and great, but I am not capable. That is another exercise; it shows I must be fed. All right strength and state comes through food; we come up to what
{294}
we are now by faith. We see in @John 6 that divine food has come in so that we might grow up to God's thoughts. One has come down to bring God's lofty thoughts; He is the bread of life, and as we feed on Him we grow up in spiritual capability to the region of divine thoughts. The reason there is so little movement with us is lack of food. We see in Leviticus the great importance of priestly food. The priests had their part in the offerings; as they fed on them they were qualified for temple service. They had the wave-breast and the heave-shoulder; a man who fed on these would be capable for anything.
The *pavilion* is the place of salvation; it has to do with the power of evil -- in the evil day the saint is hidden. It is the place of safety and protection against all the evil here. Those who have been in the house and have enquired in the temple need the pavilion in relation to the power of evil outside. The more familiar we are with the house, the more we shall feel the contrariety of everything outside and the need of salvation. My impression is that we do not feel the need of salvation until we taste the blessedness of the house and temple -- in proportion as we taste it we feel the need of the pavilion. We do not want as much of the world as we can get, but to be as secluded as possible from it. The pavilion is the place where the divine power of salvation preserves sons and priests who belong to the house and temple. Outside we are conscious of the evil and we are glad to creep into the holy enclosure where we are preserved from the hostility of the enemy. There comes a time when we feel the need of the pavilion -- then we get an experience. How many stories one has heard of the marvellous intervention of divine power for the saints! When we meet the hostility of evil men who would like to harm us or do us an injury, that is the time for the pavilion. If we have not known the blessing of the house and the light of the temple, we shall not realise the need of the pavilion. If we come down to the level of people and go along with the same kind of thing that the world does, we shall not be persecuted, but if we seek to keep up the blessing of the
{295}
house and temple, then we are conscious of great hostile power, but also great divine power, for all God's power comes in for His tried and persecuted saints. Paul said, "The Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me" (@2 Timothy 4: 18). He stood in the pavilion before Nero, a ferocious monster who thought nothing of killing three thousand people. There is no greater confirmation of faith than for saints to prove the Lord's safeguard. When you could not lift a finger to preserve yourself, then the Lord came in. Daniel was in the pavilion, secure in the lion's den. It is a wonderful experience -- you cannot help yourself and the Lord throws the curtains of His pavilion around you.
We do not think enough of the ministry of angels; they are mentioned many times in the New Testament; they are sent forth to minister to those who shall be heirs of salvation. It is good to pray the prophet's prayer, "Lord, open the young man's eyes". The whole mountain was full of chariots; they were all there before he saw them. The angels are round about us, charged with this ministry to care for the heirs of salvation. An angel can do a great deal; we read that one of them killed 185,000 valiant men.
All this leads to the *tabernacle*. The one whose heart is enjoying the house, whose mind is satisfied in the temple, who has proved the security of the pavilion, is the one who can come to the tabernacle. What answers to that is the coming together of the saints. We do not make public display. In the religious world, as the building gets finer there is often more deadness. The Lord began His course as a stranger, and all through His life He had not where to lay His head. J.N.D. said that our path here ought to be activity in obscurity; that is, activity in divine love but a hidden place of obscurity. The saints are called, "Thy hidden ones" in @Psalm 83. By and by we shall be displayed.
The saints are our attraction, there is nothing like them. If we could only see the saints clothed in the divine beauty of all that Christ is to them, and all that the Spirit has conferred on them, we should think it a privilege to save them. The
{296}
humblest saint is greater than the highest monarch. Let us not get occupied with blemishes in one another, but let us get the habit of looking at what is of Christ. The saints are the attractive power, and that is how we get to the tent. Everyone is to bring what he has learned to the common fund, just as bees bring honey to the hive. What meetings we should have if every saint were dwelling in the house and enquiring in the temple and all these streams were flowing to the tabernacle. "Sacrifices of shouts of joy" (verse 6), are the praises of God's people flowing out of happy hearts. That is a fine thing; we ought to have praises to give. All should be expressed in the tabernacle, the tent of meeting where saints come together in separation from the world, and where divine joy can express itself in spiritual sacrifices. These sacrifices are acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. All the substance of the praises that go up to God is Christ -- God could not but delight in it.
In Leviticus we see that all the exercises of the people were to be brought to the tent of meeting. Whether it was that they were troubled about sin, or whether it was a vow they had made, or whether they were bringing a burnt-offering or a meat-offering, whatever exercise a man had was brought to the tent of meeting. Every spiritual exercise was focused there. It is the same now; whatever exercise we have in secret is meant to have an effect on us when we come together to the tent of meeting.
THIRSTING OR OVERFLOWING
@Psalm 42: 1 - 11; @Psalm 45: 1 - 17
I have no doubt that these psalms give us very distinctly the experience and joy of the remnant of Israel in a day that is yet to come -- their experience as disinherited and driven out of the place of privilege, and the subsequent joy of heart with
{297}
which they will turn to their once-rejected Messiah and find supreme satisfaction in Him and in the anticipation of His reign. But I should like to say a few words at this time on these psalms in connection with the fact that they bring before us two very distinct states of soul-experience. Nothing could be more striking than the difference between them. In the one we find a soul "thirsting", in the other a heart "overflowing". @Psalm 42 answers to "If any man thirst"; while @Psalm 45 answers to "He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water" (@John 7: 37, 38).
It is a home question for every one of us. Am I "thirsting" or "overflowing"? Which of the two psalms is more truly descriptive of the experience of my soul? It is our true blessedness to have Christ so before us that our hearts are really satisfied. There is satisfaction of which the Lord spoke to the woman at Sychar's well when He said, "Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst" (@John 4: 14). It should be a cheer to the most tried and disappointed heart to know that there is a satisfaction to be had of such a wonderful nature. So that instead of the murmurs of the wilderness being in the heart and on the tongue, the glories, perfections, and love of Christ so fill the heart that when the mouth opens streams of refreshing and gladness flow forth as in @Psalm 45.
I trust every heart here covets to be in this blessed satisfaction. All the instinctive desires of the one born of God, and all the leadings of the Holy Spirit, must be in this direction, and I trust that every such exercise may be deepened in our souls. For there is no royal road by which we can travel into this blessedness without exercise. It sounds very easy and simple to say, 'You must not be self-occupied, you must be occupied with Christ', but it is not always so easy to act on this oft-repeated advice. Some of the most acute spiritual distress that I have met with has been in souls who were most anxious to be 'occupied with Christ', and whose great grief was that, in spite of much prayer and effort, they were
{298}
painfully conscious of being 'self-occupied'. There must be the learning of what self is; the exercise must be gone through in one form or another; but it is an immense encouragement to know that God has taken us up that He might deliver us, and introduce our hearts into the blessedness of conscious association with Christ. Would to God that we were a little more earnest in our desire to enter into the purpose of His love, for if there were a little desire on our part there would be a great answer of blessing on God's part.
In @Psalm 42 we have a soul in downright earnest. "As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God". If this is the language of your heart, there is great blessing in store for you. When believers are being turned upside down and inside out they are apt to be much discouraged, and to have their souls "disquieted" in them. But even amid the exercise God would give us the encouragement of knowing that He has taken us up to bring us into inconceivable blessing. "Hope thou in God", says the psalmist to his soul, "For I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance".
We *must* travel through these exercises, for the simple reason that *if Christ is to be everything self must be nothing*, and it is oftentimes a long journey to reach this point in the history of the soul. God has to bring self down to nothingness; and though the flesh can do very well with addition or multiplication, it has a strong objection to subtraction and reduction, and will never tolerate being made into a cipher. Hence the long, dreary, and painful years of self-occupation through which most believers drag their slow steps of spiritual progress. One point after another of self-sufficiency and self-importance has to be attacked and reduced, until at length the believer is brought -- to use a phrase much more familiar than the experience which it describes -- to the end of himself.
We may fix firmly in our minds the fact that self is the great hindrance to Christ in our souls. It may be good self or bad self, carnal self or legal self, worldly self or religious self,
{299}
but it is self in some form that is before us, if Christ is not everything to us, and if our souls are not in the overflowing satisfaction of conscious association with Him. Now in @Psalm 42 we see the psalmist allowed to pass through circumstances which reduced him very much. I do not mean to suggest that we find here the full exposure of the flesh. That could not come out until the cross. But we do see the psalmist reduced to extremity, and brought to nothing as to all that he was in himself, and that is the stepping-stone into the blessedness of @Psalm 45, where Christ is everything and fills the heart.
There are many ways in which the soul learns the worthlessness of self. No one could be converted without learning *something* of what he was as in the flesh; and the young convert, with his desires for holiness and his Spirit-wrought longings after Christ, finds himself in a school where he learns many lessons of the same nature. But perhaps no way could be more humbling -- or more efficacious, if the exercise is gone through with God -- than the one brought before us in this psalm. Here we do not find the thirst of the awakened sinner, or of the one who has never tasted that the Lord is gracious, but the thirst of the soul that has lost what it once enjoyed. The psalmist looks back to seasons of holy joy in the past. "When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday".
If you have received "the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation", and thus been brought to know the Lord Jesus as your risen and triumphant Saviour, I am quite sure you have known what it was to have great joy in your soul. When you saw that your sins were all put away, and that God imputed righteousness to you -- righteousness the measure and expression of which is Christ risen -- you entered into peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, and received the Spirit, who shed the love of God abroad in your heart. I dare say many here can remember the deep joy that filled their hearts when the power and preciousness of the gospel first came
{300}
home to them. I speak not of the awakening of the conscience, nor of the relief and assurance with which many are content, for neither of these gives the joy of God's salvation. I speak of the moment when Christ risen is really apprehended as the measure and expression of our righteousness, and of our title to stand in the favour of God. Such a moment is one of supreme joy. It could not be otherwise, for at that moment *we measured everything by Christ*. We were happily and completely taken outside ourselves both for righteousness and for title to stand in God's favour. We sang with triumph of His love, we exulted in His grace and in some true, if small, measure we did "joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ". How bright the meetings seemed, because we were bright ourselves. How attractive the children of God were to us, for we looked at them all in the light of the grace we had just learned for ourselves. We went with them "with the voice of joy and praise".
But it is not true that for some hearts here this joy of God's salvation, this rapture of "first love", has passed away and left an aching void? They are *thirsting* now rather than *overflowing*. With some it is an eager thirst, for they have hope and faith in God for a divine answer to the longings of their souls. With others, perhaps, almost a despairing thirst, for years of exercise seem to have brought them no nearer to the deliverance they seek. A larger class have accepted their present condition as being inevitable, and have settled down to take things as they are, and to comfort themselves with the thought of being very happy by-and-by in heaven, and with these the thirst is so feeble that it can hardly be called a thirst at all.
It may be well at this point to consider two questions which naturally suggest themselves in connection with this subject. (1) Is it absolutely necessary for one to go through an experience of this kind after he finds peace? (2) *Why* is such an experience necessary? With regard to the first of these questions, it may be remarked that some souls go through a much
{301}
deeper process of self-knowledge *before* they enter into peace than do others; and in cases where this exercise had been very deep, and the soul had been under legal preaching, peace and deliverance might be entered into almost simultaneously. But when the gospel has been fully and clearly presented souls are often brought into peace thereby, and then *afterwards* have to learn experimentally what they are as in the flesh. In answer to our second question, it may be said that our hearts have a continual tendency to make *self* the centre. Even when, by God's converting grace, we no longer make self the object of carnal gratification or of religious exaltation, we may, and do, make self the centre of the blessings which God's grace has conferred. We can all remember that it was so with us in the beginning. We thought and spoke much of *our* blessings, of what *we* had got, of what God had done for us. I am not at all objecting to this; it is, if I may say so, natural to the infancy of the soul. It gladdens our hearts to hear the young convert speak of the blessings he has got, and of his new-found joy in those blessings; but we can often see very distinctly that he is wrapping all these blessings of grace round himself, and we feel pretty sure that he will have to learn some lessons presently that will take the shine out of him. He will have to learn what a poor wretched thing he is, as in the flesh, that his heart may be transferred to a new Centre altogether. Nothing can be more distasteful to a spiritual mind than to hear people professedly giving a christian testimony which begins and ends with themselves. However natural it may be to a newborn soul to talk of himself, it is a very disappointing feature in one who has professed to know the Lord for some time. It is for the effectual displacement of all this, and to transfer the heart to a new Centre altogether, that the experience of which we are speaking is divinely necessary for our souls. God has to come in and detach us from that which is our natural centre, that He may link our affections with another Person -- even with Christ -- and make Him everything to our hearts, so that our
{302}
association *with Him* may be known, and may become the deep, lasting joy of our souls. It is this that necessitates deliverance, and this is its blessed end.
In the eleven verses of @Psalm 42 the words "I", "me", "my", occur thirty-five times, and six times the psalmist uses the expression "my soul". He is thoroughly *self-occupied*, but he is not *self-satisfied* -- he is thirsting for God. Unhappy as such a condition may be, it is ten thousand times better than Laodicean complacency and self-satisfaction. The latter is what characterises christendom today, and it is that which we ought to dread more than anything else. *Self-sufficiency* is a veil upon the heart, which blinds it to everything that is of God.
"Therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar" (verse 6). The three places here mentioned are suggestive, to my mind, of three ways in which self is reduced to nothingness in the believer. (1) By inward exercise. (2) By the testings of the wilderness. (3) By special discipline from God. We may look briefly at each of the three.
(1) In the latter part of @Romans 7 we find the experience of one who, through grace, delights in the law of God after the inward man, and is earnestly seeking to carry out God's holy will, but he finds a law in his members -- a law of sin -- to which he is in helpless captivity. He becomes painfully conscious that sin dwells in him, and eventually reaches the conclusion that in him, that is, in his flesh, there is nothing but sin -- good he cannot find. It is by the law that he discovers this -- by the effort to carry out God's will -- so that which was ordained to life he finds to be unto death. *He is brought down to death*. Death is that state out of which nothing comes for God, and if I am truly conscious that good does not dwell in me I am brought down to death -- the "land of Jordan". Paul reached this point in a very short time because he was in real earnest. He learned in three days a lesson which it often takes a lifetime to learn. We are long on the road because we are so little in earnest about it. But all this is inward experience
{303}
and exercise. Outwardly Paul's life was most exemplary; it is not at all outward failure that others might see; it is the inward exercise in which the true character of sin in the flesh is discovered.
(2) The object of all the trial and testing of the wilderness was, as @Deuteronomy 8: 2 tells us, "to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no". God leads us by a trying and rugged path (Hermon means "rugged") that the naughtiness and pride of our hearts may be discovered. God loves us too well to allow us to be deceived as to our true character as in the flesh. He puts us in the very circumstances that bring it out. Not one of us can escape this testing and sifting. And as our true character is thus brought to light, we fret and chafe and murmur. How inexpressibly vexatious it is to always have something turning up that gives occasion to our hearts to show what is in them! If we only had a path in which we could always acquit ourselves creditably, how different it would be! If things would only go as we should like, how well and happily should we get on! Yes, and how supremely self-satisfied we should become! But God will find us out, and so He causes us to traverse this land of the Hermonites until our hearts in their bitterness say, 'Why does God put me into such circumstances as these? Why does He not make it easier for me? Why does something always occur to overturn my efforts to be good, and to make fruitless all my desires to be holy? If God would order things differently for me, my life would not be the contemptible failure that it now is'. Has your heart never uttered such language as this? Do you know what it means? Why, it is casting the blame of your sin upon God, and this is the outcome of satanic enmity. It is the bite of the serpent. In a thousand ways you have proved the goodness and mercy of God, and yet your heart is capable of turning round upon Him and suggesting that His ordering for you is to blame for all your failure. What a discovery this is of those hidden springs of enmity against God that rise in the carnal mind!
{304}
(3) The "hill Mizar" (the little hill) may represent any special discipline of God by which we are made consciously weak and small. When Paul came down from the third heaven there was given him a thorn for the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet him; and this, he tells us, was "lest I should be exalted above measure". It was his "hill Mizar". God allowed Satan so to act on Paul's flesh, by some form of bodily suffering, that he was conscious of nothing in himself but weakness. You may say, 'That must be a miserable experience'. Well, Paul was not miserable; he was supremely happy. He says, "Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities ... : for when I am weak, then am I strong" (@2 Corinthians 12: 9, 10). He was happy to have all his own strength reduced to nothingness, that he might prove instead the sufficiency of the Lord's grace and Christ's strength.
As to these three forms of self-reduction, the first two are *instructive*, while the third is rather *protective*. The inward exercise of @Romans 7 and the testing of the wilderness serve the purpose of teaching us what sin in the flesh is, and what is in our hearts; while such special discipline of God as Paul's thorn is rather to protect us from the unaltered tendencies of the flesh. The latter is *always* needed, and goes on in one form or other to the end of our course here.
It is well for us to get to the end and the bottom of ourselves, for when we really get to the bottom with God we reach deliverance. Paul no sooner reaches "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me out of this body of death?" than he exclaims, "I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord". The children of Israel, bitten by the serpent and brought down to death, found the way of life opened up by beholding the serpent of brass. When we truly abhor ourselves, we are prepared to rejoice in the blessed fact that our old man has been crucified with Christ -- that sin in the flesh was condemned when Christ died, that our whole history as in the flesh closed before God in His death -- and that this is
{305}
our title to be free. I have now a righteous title to have done with myself because Christ has died. To prepare me for this I have to learn the necessity for death in my own experience, but *the death of Christ* is my title to be free. It is by the appropriation of His death that I reach liberty and life; that death has severed me from all that I was in Adam. "I am crucified with Christ". I am free from myself, and free to have Christ before me, and to learn how I am associated with Him in new creation. In a word, I pass from the experience of @Psalm 42 into that of @Psalm 45.
The change is most striking. It is no longer "I", "me", "my", but "Thou", "Thee", "Thy". The soul has got a totally new Object and Centre; it has come to God's Centre. The old astronomers found the motions of the planetary bodies quite inexplicable because they looked upon the earth as the centre of the universe. It was not until a bold, free mind travelled forth into space and found a new centre that harmony and order were seen to reign where all had seemed confusion before. So long as the soul is self-centred it can make no real acquaintance with, or progress in, the thoughts and purposes of God. But when Christ gets His right place for our souls, we begin to apprehend the wondrous depth and perfection of those thoughts and purposes, and then our blessings are all, as it were, glorified. We are then able to leave self altogether behind, and to enter the atmosphere of divine love. @Psalm 45 is called "a song of loves"; and so completely has it this character, that there is not a word in it about what the Lord *has done*; the heart is engaged with *Himself*. Love thinks more of the Giver than of His gifts -- more of the love than of the work which love has wrought. It is when the Person of Christ is thus before the heart that it begins to bubble over, and to burn as did those of the disciples on the way to Emmaus when the Stranger spoke of "the things concerning himself". Then, verily, the heart is inditing a good matter; it is absorbed in the contemplation of the altogether lovely One. *Self* has been learned and given up as worthless, and another Person, who eclipses everything, is
{306}
now before the soul.. Four great and precious facts as to that Person come before the heart.
1. "Thou art fairer than the children of men". It is only the believer who can see attractiveness and beauty in Jesus.
To the natural man Barabbas is more lovely than Jesus; not that he likes Barabbas to break into his house or pick his pocket, but he can understand Barabbas, and he cannot understand Jesus. The Beatitudes (@Matthew 5: 3 - 10) give us the portrait of the One who is "fairer than the children of men". Poor in spirit, a Mourner in this world of sin and woe, meek, hungering and thirsting after righteousness, merciful, pure in heart, a Peacemaker, One persecuted for righteousness sake -- these are the traits of His beauty. The natural man says, 'These are poor things, and but of plain appearance. A Man of such a character as that is no good in this world'.
The Man who will not assert Himself because He feels that God has no place here, who will bear injury and wrong without murmuring, whose one insatiable desire is to do the will of God though it entails nothing but suffering and persecution here, is looked upon by the world with contempt, and where the conscience has felt the power of His testimony, He is positively hated. "He is despised and rejected of men".
Christ was just the opposite to the world's ideal man. A man who by brilliant genius, commanding personality, and indomitable perseverance has secured position, wealth, or fame, is the world's ideal. The one who makes himself great in the eyes of men is the world's hero, and I fear that Christians are often deceived by the glitter of fame and the acclamations of human applause, and they come to admire men who are the very opposite to the meek and lowly Jesus. Oh that we may be kept in the secret of God's presence, so as to know what He appreciates in man! It is a proof of immense favour from God if in our heart's estimation Christ is "fairer than the children of men". It is easy to sing hymns, and to use the most precious expressions in Scripture in a sentimental way, but it is another thing for our hearts really to find rest and satisfaction in the moral perfections of Christ. It is
{307}
blessed to find the heart thrilling with something of the ecstasy which the Bride feels as she describes Him -- beginning with "The chiefest among ten thousand", and ending with "He is altogether lovely" (@Song of Songs 5: 10 - 16).
2. "Grace is poured into thy lips". There has been One here in whom and by whom all the grace of God could express itself. The Son of God took a place of perfect dependence here as the Vessel of that grace, and in that dependent place the Lord God gave Him "the tongue of the learned", that He "should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary" (@Isaiah 50: 4). Well might the Nazarenes marvel at the gracious words which proceeded out of His mouth. Well might those sent to take Him have to confess, "Never man spake like this man". The evangelist Luke presents Him specially in the blessed character of the Minister of grace, and how full and matchless is the record! The synagogues at Nazareth and Capernaum, the sea-shore of Galilee, the house of Levi, the cornfields, the gate of the city of Nain, the Pharisee's house, and all the scenes of the holy ministry right on to Calvary, have their own sweet tale to tell of the grace that was poured into His lips, and which flowed forth from those lips in a fulness which nothing could stay. Nay, the very cavils and opposition of unbelief and self-righteousness only served to bring it out more fully, as the attempt to stay the flow of some mighty river might cause it to overflow all its banks. The grace of God has told itself out here in a Man. God has found the satisfaction of His heart in having One here who not only could, and did, fill the whole compass of man's responsibility with perfection, but was the full expression of divine grace here, and this, withal, in perfect dependence. There was but one Person who could thus bring and express the grace of God in a world of sin, and He has done it perfectly. Blessed for ever be His sacred name!
3. The "sword" and the "arrows" (verses 3, 5), bear witness that the One into whose lips grace was poured has been rejected here. Judgment awaits His enemies -- judgment rendered inevitable by the fact that men have refused the
{308}
grace of God, and rejected the One in whom it all came. This world has rewarded Christ evil for good, and hatred for His love. It is now the scene of His rejection -- soon to be the scene of victorious judgment whereby God shall make His foes His footstool. But for the present Christ is dishonoured and disinherited here. He has been cut off and had nothing. He is cast aside as worthless by men, who see no beauty in Him that they should desire Him.
4. But in wondrous contrast to this we read, "Therefore God hath blessed thee for ever" (verse 2). Every step of that pathway of lowly and devoted love has had its answer. Not *here*, indeed, for that blessed One had nothing here; none of this world's honour graced His brow; its commonest civilities were denied Him; He had not where to lay His head; nor, so far as we know, did He ever possess a penny. His blessing is in *another sphere*; His exaltation is in heaven; He is crowned with glory and honour at the right hand of God. He is the Man of joy for ever now, for He has entered the fulness of joy in the presence of God, and the pleasures for evermore which are at His right hand. "Thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance" (@Psalm 21: 6). I referred a few moments ago to the Beatitudes as giving the portrait of the One fairer than the children of men, and I may now call your attention to a verse which follows them: "Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward *in heaven*" (@Matthew 5: 12). The Beatitudes have their fruition in heaven; Christ has His blessings, His reward and compensation, there. Everything was unsuited to Him here, but He is now in a scene where everything is suited to Him. Can we not truly say,
<blockquote>'O Lord, tis joy to look above, <br>And see Thee on the throne'? (`474:1)</blockquote>
We are still in the place of His rejection, but we joy in His exaltation *there*; and, through infinite grace, *we are linked with Him* in the place of His joy and His glory. What could be more wonderful and blessed?
{309}
"God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness *above thy fellows*" (verse 7). Here the marvellous fact is disclosed that Christ in glory has got "fellows" -- companions. Upon earth He was *alone* in His beauty -- the single Corn of Wheat. There could be no link between the Second Man out of heaven and the sinful race of Adam. But in His death the whole race for whom He died was condemned and set aside in judgment, and as the risen and glorified One He has become the Head of a new race, to whom He has given eternal life, and who are associated with Him in His wondrous place as Man before God and the Father. By the will of God we are "sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once" (@Hebrews 10: 10). That is, by His death we have been set apart from everything that we were as in the flesh, that we might be *of Him* in new creation -- all of one with Himself -- His fellows. "For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren" (@Hebrews 2: 11). Beloved brethren, does not this captivate and satisfy the heart? To see that by the death of Christ I am entitled to be free from myself -- to drop everything that I am as in the flesh -- that I may pass into conscious association with that blessed One in glory. Now, indeed, my heart has got a new Centre; and has begun to learn with God the greatness of the thoughts of divine love. I begin to realise the immensity of God's purpose and grace, and to be lost in wonder, love, and praise. Thus we learn the character and dignity of the priestly company of whom Christ can speak as "My brethren", and to whom He can declare the Father's name. For if we learn these precious things, as we must learn everything, *individually*, it is that we may know the character of the *company* to which, through grace, we belong.
Notice, too, that it is in connection with this we have the Holy Spirit mentioned. "God, thy God, hath anointed thee *with the oil of gladness* above thy fellows". The gift of the Spirit is distinctly connected with the fact that Jesus is glorified (@John 7: 39). It is with Christ in glory that the Holy
{310}
Spirit links us. As the glorified Man He has received the Holy Spirit (@Acts 2: 33), and this anointing He shares with His brethren. As Aaron and his sons were all sprinkled with the same "anointing oil" in the day of their consecration (@Exodus 29: 21), so Christ and His "brethren" have this blessed anointing in common. Yet in this, as in everything else, He must have the pre-eminence; He is anointed "above" His fellows, and our faith and love rejoice that it should be so.
Then observe the peculiar character in which the Holy Spirit is here spoken of -- "The oil of gladness". In the New Testament we find again and again that joy is connected with the Holy Spirit. "The disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Spirit" (@Acts 13: 52). "Joy in the Holy Spirit"
(@Romans 14: 17). (Compare also @Ephesians 5: 18, 19.) Does not this throw a glorious light upon the character of the Christian's joys? The Holy Spirit is the divine power by which our hearts are brought into conscious association with Christ; He is the "well of water springing up into everlasting life" (@John 4: 14). His indwelling gives capacity to taste of heavenly joys -- the joys of that ineffable scene of divine affections into which Christ has entered as 'the Father's Glorified'. Do we not long to taste of those joys? Are we prepared to go in for them? Do we really believe that the Holy Spirit dwells in us to make our hearts overflow with heavenly gladness?
The effect of gladness within is fragrance without. "All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad" (verse 8). The fragrance I take to be the fruit of the Spirit -- the qualities, graces, and moral perfections of Christ -- "Love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance" (@Galatians 5: 22). I have no doubt we should all like to be thus fragrant, but I am quite sure that this will only be the case as we are in the gladness of which I have spoken. It is not the clearness and accuracy of our scriptural intelligence, or the ability with which we can present the truth, that impresses people, so much as the fact that they can discern when we have an inward satisfaction and gladness to which
{311}
they are strangers. I well remember hearing a beloved servant of the Lord speak of the knowledge of Christ in glory. I was greatly impressed, but it was not so much by the information imparted as by the conviction, 'That man has something which I should like to have'. If others can see that we have something which they have not, it will set them thirsting to have it too. Nothing helps people so much as this, and they can soon discover when we have this heavenly "gladness" in our souls. If there is the gladness within there is sure to be the fragrance without.
May each of us prove the blessed reality of all this, so that instead of thirsting we may be satisfied and overflowing.
FROM C.A.C.S NOTES
@Psalm 42: 1 - 11; @Psalm 44:1 - 26; @Psalm 45:1 - 17
@Psalm 32 is the covenant -- the favourableness of God to man as a Justifier, Reconciler, Deliverer and Recoverer. This is the basis of all divine instruction. It may be called the normal relations of the justified man who is taught of God under the instruction of the new covenant.
But when we come to the second book of Psalms the conditions are abnormal and we are tested by abnormal conditions. There is nothing more testing than to be deprived of privileges we have once enjoyed and to have no outward evidence that God is with us, so that adversaries can say, "Where is thy God?" To go with the festive multitude is very happy, but we have to be tested by the land of the Jordan, the Hermons, and mount Mizar. We have to learn to confide in God when things are not outwardly festive, when if we have not God Himself we shall get dried up. So that we find here an intense desire for God as meeting every disquietude of soul. Do we know Him enough to be quite sure that there are salvations in His countenance? And that we can learn
{312}
Him, and have every thirst quenched in circumstances which test us to the last point of endurance? @2 Corinthians 3 and 4 give us new covenant ministry but what discipline comes on the vessel! Then the ministry of reconciliation carries with it the discipline of chapter 6. The man in @Psalm 42 is not in the present good of what Paul had, but he is on the way to it. If we are convinced that it is there in God for us, let us go in for it.
Then in @Psalm 44 it is not merely individual exercises but it is the people of God generally, no longer the triumphs of the apostle's day, but given over to the adversary. Now what a testing this is, God unable to give public support to His people, so that they become a mocking and derision to those round about. Are we just prepared to be without any public recognition, but remembering the Lord and not dealing falsely with the covenant, not turning back nor having steps declined from His path? This psalm is quoted in @Romans 8: 37, "We more than conquer through him that has loved us".
We have to learn the instruction of @Psalm 42 and @Psalm 44, but the answer to these deep and searching exercises comes in @Psalm 45. What an instruction this is -- a song of the Beloved. There is not a word in the psalm that is self-centred: it is all Christ-centred. No thirst now -- the heart welling forth.
FROM C.A.C.S NOTES
@Psalm 45: 1 - 17
Note that "sons of men" (verse 2) is sons of Adam, not of Enosh. He has companions who love what He loves and hate what He hates. That is, they are morally suited to Him, so that they can share the anointing.
Then verse 8 seems to bring in the fragrance of His sufferings. All His garments -- all the features of love which He
{313}
wears -- are fragrant with the sweet odour of His having been in death. There is not an office which He fills, or a service which He renders, or a glory that attaches to Him that does not derive peculiar fragrance from His having lain in death. The King has been the Sufferer. He takes the kingdom, and the queen and all that attends on her, on that ground.
Now if palaces are provided for Him it must be on the same principle, so that they are "ivory palaces"; every bit of the material for them secured at the cost of death. The elephant is a great animal, but it is through its death that ivory is obtained. If a palace for Christ is to be secured it must be through death being brought in on our members which are upon the earth -- those things which are native to our flesh. We have the opportunity of living as other people do, and gratifying the desires of the flesh or the mind. But if these things are refused and death brought in upon them in the power of affection for Christ there is a bit of ivory to make Him a palace. Which would you prefer, a little bit of gratification for self, or a palace for Christ? Let every true companion of His answer!
Then out of ivory palaces there "Stringed instruments" speak of hearts attuned to minister to His joy. All stringed instruments are delicate in their adjustment: they tend to get out of tune and to fall below the proper pitch. With what jealous care we need to keep our hearts! Because we are playing in the presence of "the chief Musician": how soon His ear detects a note that is not up to normal pitch!
Then it is noticeable that the last half of the psalm brings in the side of what is for His pleasure in His saints. It brings in the subjective side. "Daughters" are prominent, "Kings daughters", then one who is pre-eminently the "daughter", then "the daughter of Tyre" and "the virgins, her companions". "Kings daughters" would suggest the high estate of the saints as of royal lineage. They are suitable to the King as having a lineage which corresponds with His own: they are come sounds of music.
{314}
born of God. "Ye are of God, children, and have overcome them, because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world" (@1 John 4: 4). John's epistle gives us the features of the royal lineage.
Then the queen would speak of Jerusalem as the city of the great King (@Isaiah 60, 62). Now the bride, the Lamb's wife, is a city. What Jerusalem will be the assembly is now -- "The holy city, Jerusalem". The city is "pure gold, like pure glass" (@Revelation 21: 18). The "gold of Ophir" would refer, I think, to the glory of new covenant conditions. The ministry of the Spirit subsists in glory, the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory. There is now an abiding character of things which subsists in glory. In having the Spirit and righteousness we stand in gold of Ophir. It is what is brought to us through grace in the new covenant.
But this involves a breaking, even in mind, with our own people and our father's house. Whatever status we have naturally, or whatever links of affection, all is to be forgotten in the joy of being for Christ. We recognise natural relationships, but they do not hold us. Our beauty in the eyes of Christ is a separatedness to Him. He is thy Lord (@Philippians 3).
Verse 12 is a hint of the Gentiles coming in to recognise the place the saints have.
Then "all glorious within" is like @John 14 - 17. Her clothing wrought gold would be in advance of verse 9; it is now what is wrought of God (like @2 Corinthians 5). We are invested with what is divinely wrought: there is a beginning of a good work and it will be completed unto Jesus Christ's day. How much can be incorporated in the city? The gift of the Spirit and righteousness are the beginning, but then there is, "During many days were they fashioned" (@Psalm 139: 16). "Wrought gold" would be @Ephesians 3: 14 - 21.
Then "raiment of embroidery" is the working out of righteousness in detail. It is done stitch by stitch. Everything that is right as of the Spirit as life, and as in the spirit of Christ.
"The virgins behind her, her companions" would refer to other companies of saints to follow as in Revelation;
{315}
the cities of Judah (@Isaiah 40). In verse 16 we get sons: all the features are to be perpetuated in sons. We are children of Jerusalem above.
FROM C.A.C.S NOTES
@Psalm 45: 1 - 17
The Maschil Psalms give us (@Psalm 32) the knowledge of God in forgiveness and justification, as Deliverer and Resource and Guide of His people. Then there is in @Psalm 42 the intense longing of the soul for God when the experiences of His favour are withdrawn and there is no outward manifestation of His presence. One has gone with the festive multitude, but that fails, and Jordan, Hermons and Mizar have to be known. God wants us to go to His tabernacles through real soul exercise of our own and not merely as passing along with the multitude. It is not a multitude in @Psalm 43 (which is really a second part of @Psalm 42) but "thy light and thy truth". The festive multitude we may be deprived of, but God's light and truth remain to lead and bring us to His holy mount and to His tabernacle. Then we go to "the altar of God, unto the God of the gladness of my joy". We come to the house in a deeper and truer way and we have more joy in God than we had as first learning the covenant.
Then @Psalm 44 is instruction for a day when it is not outward triumph, but reproach and suffering, and God seems to hide His face: He does not come in in any public way. We have not only the normal sufferings of Christians but the peculiar sufferings of 2 Timothy days. But it is in such circumstances that we learn we are inseparable from the love of Christ, and we come into view as His lilies among thorns. We should like the thorns to be removed, but He has put us there to make us more distinctive. It is the crooked and perverse
{316}
generation that shows up the contrast in those who are harmless and simple, irreproachable children of God.
Now we can get a wondrous "instruction" -- a song of the Beloved. The heart can be filled with Christ and with what stands in relation to Him. And it is Christ as He will be known in the world to come. The present world is an evil world: it gives Christ no place; but He will be supreme in the world to come. It is the world to come that we Christians speak of (@Hebrews 2: 5); we have no interest in speaking of this world, it hates both Christ and the Father. He will have to gird His sword upon His thigh and to make His arrows sharp in the heart of His enemies. The sword and the arrows are to secure a place here for truth and meekness and righteousness. These are the things Christ brings in. If He has brought them into our hearts the world to come has arrived there!
One would note and dwell on the fact that this psalm is not God speaking to men about Christ. It is sons of Korah speaking out what their hearts are full of -- what they have composed "touching the king". Had we ever an ambition to say something of Christ that no one had ever said before? Do we really believe that the Spirit of God would delight to give us an apprehension of Christ that was a fresh instruction for the sons of Korah?
First we have to learn to compare Him with the sons of men. I take it that the sons of men are those that have fair features before God. We are told that Moses was 'fair to God', and all down the ages there have been those sons of men who have had divine features. But He has outshone all the saints. An Enoch and an Abraham and a Joseph and a Moses and a David were fair sons of men, but here is One who is fairer. "Who do men say that I the Son of man am?" They counted Him as one of the sons of men, John, Elias, Jeremiah or one of the prophets. They had not learned that He was fairer than all the earth-born race. For every feature of beauty that had been seen directly in them shone in full splendour in Him and in perfection. He is altogether lovely.
{317}
We think of John, Peter, Paul, Stephen: they all had some of His features, but He is fairer than all. His name is above every name. Perfect in everything was He, alone since Adam's fall.
That is the Vessel -- the human Vessel. Then grace is poured into His lips. That is the grace of God towards sinful men. The grace of Luke's gospel. It could not be poured into any other lips: "Never man spake like this man". God found His delight in Him as the Vessel in whom He could express all His grace. Is that our apprehension of Christ? That through His life all the vast and unfathomable grace of God has come to us? What a Person we have to delight in!
Then "God hath blessed thee for ever". I think that is His exaltation as the glorified Man, that all that was set forth in the lowly Man might now be set forth in the exalted Man (see the Acts).
Now we come to the truth of His person. He is addressed as "O God". The deity of the Messiah. The kingdom of God is a present reality to His saints, and the sceptre of that kingdom is one of uprightness. There is never any deviation from uprightness in the rule of that kingdom -- no policy, no diplomacy.
He is anointed with gladness from God above his companions. The anointing is on all His garments. His garments would indicate what he is invested with: it speaks of fragrance in every form of love which He wears -- Revealer, Teacher, Priest, Advocate, Intercessor, Shepherd; we see Him in different garments. Everything is fragrant.
Ivory palaces speak of incomparable reception for Him, secured through death. An elephant is an imposing animal, but it is through death that its ivory is obtained. What have we contributed to the ivory palaces? Stringed instruments are there: hearts tuned to utter what is delightful to Christ. A great throne of ivory was made by Solomon: what is suitable for His dwelling.
{318}
FROM C.A.C.S NOTES
@Psalm 45: 1 - 17
The exercises of the previous Maschil Psalms having been gone through, a peculiar and blessed knowledge of Christ becomes the portion of the heart. It is "good matter" composed in the heart before it is manifested in glory. That is, the heart is engaged with Christ as He will be publicly known in the world to come. The epistle to the Hebrews gives the corresponding knowledge of Him. God has brought in an all-surpassing excellence -- One without peer or rival -- and He has presented His own grace through the lips of that glorious One. It is in this way that all is set aside in our hearts that is not marked by truth and meekness and righteousness. All goes out by the expulsive power of the knowledge of Christ. Everything must give way to Christ. So we get the sword and the arrows and the right hand of victorious power: the enemies are all to be the footstool of His feet.
Then we get the throne, the sceptre and the anointing. The kingdom of God is set up in a Man where moral qualities are suitable to God. He rules by bringing His people to love what He loves and to hate what He hates. So that He gets not only subjects but companions -- Christ's assembly all of one with Himself. Then we begin to appreciate the fragrance that lies in the anointing. Myrrh -- His suffering love -- but aloes go along with it in the burial of the Lord. They seem to be connected with the Lord as having been in death. The rare fragrance of that death is connected with such a Person going into death.
There are no spices in Matthew, Mark or Luke: a clean linen cloth in Matthew, fine linen in Mark and Luke. But in John the spices are prominent: it is simply "linen with the spices", the fragrance connected with His being in death. He brought fragrance there for God and man. Cassia, I would suggest, may refer to all the fragrance of His life here which
{319}
could be carried through into resurrection. His soul could not be left to Sheol, nor the Holy One see corruption. It is a great thing to go on with what will abide in resurrection. Natural relationships will go, and responsibilities of human life, but there is something else that goes through: "It is I myself", the same Person in a new condition. All that was in the power of the anointing was just the same in resurrection as in the days of his flesh.
I suppose that naturally no one ever heard of such a thing as an "ivory palace". It would be too costly for even a Solomon to build: we do read of houses of ivory (@Amos 3: 15, @1 Kings 22: 39). Every bit of material for such palaces had been secured at the cost of death. If there is a palace for Christ it is of such material it is constructed. It has meant death to that life which I should naturally have led. My bent would be to gratify myself, my pride, vanity, selfishness or some other natural desire. But Christ has come in and the test of a disciple is in @Luke 14: 26.
"Stringed instruments" soon get out of tune: this is one of the psalms "To the chief Musician".
Then we get the queen: the relationship is a settled one. There is no "queen" in the Song of Songs as applied to the bride: no settled condition. But here she stands in divine suitability "in gold of Ophir". Nothing that is of you comes in: you get a new investiture altogether from God as illustrated in the prodigal. What is given is the greatest of all. We think of things getting developed in our souls, but the greatest of all is given and is wholly of God.
Now these things are to be hearkened to; so that there is no holding, even in thought, to what we were naturally. Thus we become attractive to Christ: He is thy Lord, He has become supreme. It is not His authority here, He is supreme. The thought of the Gentiles recognising the place that Jerusalem has is brought in here, a hint of gentile appreciation. How wonderful that the Gentile should now be the queen! The King's daughter glorious within: @John 13 - 17 is within. Learn what the thoughts of Christ are about you: you will
{320}
be overwhelmed with the profound blessedness of these. "Wrought gold" would be what is divinely wrought in the soul, "He that has wrought us for this very thing is God" (@2 Corinthians 5: 5). Then the raiment of embroidery is the working out of things through exercise: see @Revelation 19. Then we have the thought of others "behind her": I think it has reference to those who come in after Jerusalem -- the cities of Judah. We can apply it to the companions who come in after the assembly with virgin character and washed robes.
Then we lose sight of the fathers and think of sons made princes. How the fathers disappear when Christ comes into view! The great thing then is to bring forth a seed for him of princely character.
HOW GOD WORKS TO SECURE HIS OWN PLEASURE
@Psalm 40: 5 - 10; @Psalm 139: 14 - 18
C.A.C. I suggested these scriptures because in the first we see the pleasure of God accomplished in Christ, and in the second we have a hint of its accomplishment in the saints. We often consider from the side of our blessing but it is an immense thing to look at things from the side of the pleasure of God. Anyone who loved God would delight in looking at things from that standpoint. We should not lose our blessing; we should find it magnified and glorified by looking at it from this standpoint. It is one of the greatest privileges and brings us nearest to the occupations of heaven, to look at things from the side of God's pleasure.
Ques. Is it not a triumph that that is possible?
C.A.C. Yes, God's pleasure has taken a definite form: "Lo, I come: ... to do thy will". I connect that with the thought of the book; what is written down is definite; it suggests the immutability of His counsel; you have it in black
{321}
and white. We have here the thought of an eternal book, and all that is written is for God's pleasure.
Now in @Psalm 40 Christ is distinctly in view -- it must commence there because everything for God's pleasure must be carried out by a divine Person, and a divine Person come into manhood; that is, there is a Person great enough to compass all these thoughts. If you think of God's thoughts you are lost: there is creation, which is marvellous; but what about the mind and thoughts of God? They are immense! Just think -- they are adequate to yield eternal pleasure to the heart of God, and we are brought in as an essential part of that pleasure. The thought of it would deliver us from even spiritual self-occupation, and that is the worst kind of self-occupation there is because it is so insidious.
<blockquote>'Our God the centre is, <br>His presence fills that land, <br>And countless myriads, owned as His, <br>Round Him adoring stand'. (`72:2)</blockquote>
All there, is for God's pleasure. There is nothing so great as the incarnation. @Psalm 40 speaks of that, and that is essential so that we might be brought in. It speaks of Christ as One whose ears are digged, and the Holy Spirit in @Hebrews 10 translates that, "Thou hast prepared me a body", showing that the ear is a characteristic member of man's body. There was a divine Person here in a place of obedience, One equal to the pleasure of God, and whatever God said to Him He was able to carry out; not one element of divine pleasure failed.
Ques. Why does it say, "Sacrifices and offerings ... thou willedst not"?
C.A.C. All that was connected with the legal system, sacrifices which were offered under the law. The great point of this is that the Son has come forth to bring to pass the pleasure of God and to do it all in the obedience of love. He delighted in what He came to do; He was in communion with God as to it all. He could enter into every thought of God
{322}
and find delight in carrying them out. Who could do that but the Son? We can understand the Father's delight in that blessed Man in this world.
The moment we come to Christ we leave all failure behind. Many are breaking their hearts over failure, but turn to Christ and you get into the region of divine favour; we come to things that abide, and that have an eternal character. How blessed to come near to God to have the joy of contemplating His will fully accomplished. The soul is prepared to worship, to bow down in the presence of all the blessedness of God. What could be so elevating?
God has a Son, a Son-servant, "*He* shall be to me for son" (@Hebrews 1: 5). All the blessed God could look for in a Son, and in a servant, He has found in One who could fulfil all His pleasure, and leave nothing uneffected: nothing will fail. There seems to come a voice out of eternity engaging to bring to pass all that is in God's heart: "Lo, I come: ... to do thy will"; and then notice another voice in @Revelation 21: another voice from the coming eternity says, "It is done" (verse 6). All the pleasure of God is accomplished and put on such a footing that it can never fail; it is put on the platform of resurrection. We only read this psalm aright on a resurrection platform. It begins with One taken out of a miry pit and set on a rock -- the rock of resurrection -- and you read the psalm from that standpoint. It is put upon an imperishable foundation. How the fragrance of the service ascended up.
Ques. What is the force of "Thy law is within my heart"?
C.A.C. That relates to man's responsibility. Christ has filled up the whole of it with divine perfection. Nothing has failed that God looked for in man; He magnified the law and made it honourable. The tables were broken first but put in the ark afterwards. Everything is secured in Christ. God found all he looked for in Christ.
Rem. The pleasure of God needed such a man.
C.A.C. Yes, the word "will" is really pleasure; there is nothing negative about it. We dwell too much on our relief, but to see the pleasure of God sets us free. We are always
{323}
hankering after our relief, but if we saw the infinite pleasure of God in Christ and His work it would set us free. Many souls are in bondage because they have never seen that.
Then in connection with that, there is the testimony of all God is for man. We see both sides in this psalm. Christ fully undertakes for God, but then He makes known all God is for man: righteousness, love, truth; His delight is that others may know it. Think of the delight of Christ in making known to us all that God is for man. If we want to delight Christ now, let Him make better known to us what God is for man. It is very precious to think of the Lord proving here all that God is for man and then making it known to others. We think of the Son coming forth to reveal God, but I think we must have in our hearts the thought that He carried in His heart the full knowledge of God. He could say, "I know him" (@John 8: 55): he could speak of the Father as One whom He knew, in whose love He dwelt and whose righteousness and faithfulness He was proving continually. If we get into the company of Christ, and get our impressions from Him, we shall have the same thoughts of God as He had. Can you conceive of anything greater? -- to think of God as His Son thought of Him! Think of His righteousness and faithfulness and loving-kindness as known in Jesus here.
Ques. Is declaring it more than preaching it?
C.A.C. Yes, the point is that others are to know what He knew. What He knew He does not keep to Himself. What a joy that the Lord would have peculiar pleasure in giving us the knowledge of God. His knowledge was perfect. He was great enough to be equal to the revelation, and as Man He walked in the light and good of it. That is the character of the knowledge that he imparts. He could not give us any other. He proved it, before he made it good to us. He knew it as Man Himself. He could express it in a way that brought it home to man because he was a Man.
Now in @Psalm 139 we have suggested in a mystical way the formation of saints. It is new creation. We have the thought of the pleasure of God taking form in the saints. There are
{324}
two great thoughts -- divine searchings and divine formation. The searchings are necessary because of what we are, and the formation comes in because of what God is. We see God working out His pleasure in saints. In @John 4 He searched out all the woman was, but He found a worshipper. We get the thought of the book (verses 14 - 16) again. "I am fearfully, wonderfully made". It is a question of being formed under the hand of God, but it was all written in a book beforehand.
How blessed that God has written in a book all that He is going to do with us. Here the great thought is formation.
God has written all the members in His book and He has provided an effectual means of forming His saints, and though it takes a long time to do it, He will finish His work. "I will not leave thee until I have done what I have spoken to thee of" (@Genesis 28: 15). God has taken up His people to form them, and it will never be changed. It is written in black and white in His book, and He has an efficient means of bringing it to pass. The means by which He does it is the death of Christ!
It says in verse 15, "I was ... curiously wrought in the lower parts of the earth" -- that refers to His death. We are told in @Ephesians 4 that He descended into the lower parts of the earth. In the death of Christ was "curiously wrought" all that God would use in forming His saints for eternity. We do not think enough of the death of Christ as the formative principle of God's new universe. We are all familiar with the thought of Eve being taken out of Adam; he was put to sleep, and Eve was taken out of him. We all think of the church as taken out of the death of Christ, but we have not very clear thoughts of how the church was formed by the death of Christ. All was wrought in the lower parts of the earth.
There is nothing so formative as the consideration of the death of Christ. Every formative element was concentrated in that death; everything came out that was positive and formative. Christ in death becomes the efficient source of all that is for God's pleasure in men in new creation: "He shall
{325}
see a seed" (@Isaiah 53: 10), and, "It shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation" (@Psalm 22: 30).
We need to come under the formative power of Christ, and of everything that was curiously wrought in His death. Everything has been brought into a spot where it applies in a most blessed way to us. Take the love of God, where do you learn it? Is it not the chief means of formative work? Where does it come out? In death. The love of God has been worked out in the death of Christ to form us in the knowledge of God Himself. Take the sin you find in yourself -- under divine searchings you find sin in yourself, but if I turn to the death of Christ I see that sin dealt with according to all that is due to God. That becomes a formative influence. You learn righteousness in the death of Christ. You have a righteous thought of your sin, and you see how it is dealt with, so you cannot go on with it because you are affected by the way it has been dealt with in Christ.
Take the world, where does a saint get a right judgment of the world? Only in the death of Christ. You do not get it by looking at the bad things of the world, but by looking at the world in the light of the death of Christ. So the death of Christ becomes formative and you make a clean break with the world. We are formed morally by what is wrought in the death of Christ, and in result there is complete formation according to God. Nothing could be more formative than the Lord's supper if we took it rightly. We are in the presence of Christ as gone into death, and we have the full display there of what was curiously wrought in the lower parts of the earth. We should not eat the Lord's supper without being affected in a formative way by it, so as to come out a little more formed after Christ and for the pleasure of God.
Ques. Is that increasing by the true knowledge of God?
C.A.C. Yes, the searchings and formations go on together. All that is contrary to the death of Christ is exposed by the searchings, and at the same time we are formed by all that was brought out in the death of Christ, including
{326}
righteousness, holiness, love, and truth. All discipline and ministry help us to be formed by what came out in the death of Christ, and every saint is the subject of this work. You get here that the searchings are desired. "Search me" (verse 23). You welcome them because you desire to get rid of all that is contrary to what was curiously wrought in the lower parts of the earth. All this is going on with us (verse 16) "during many days were they fashioned". It is really 'through many days'. They have lasted over one thousand nine hundred years. The fashioning of the members has been going on, and we are nearer the end, and the saints will be for the pleasure of God eternally as a result of this work.
The consideration of this should have an effect on us; to see how God worked in Christ for His own pleasure, and now is working in His saints, so that all that is written in His book is to take effect. His thoughts are infinitely great and precious, but they will all be carried out.
We ought to be exercised as to formation, and then, when the thoughts of God become precious, they are the objects of pursuit. The searchings expose all that is contrary to God, and the divine formation effects all that is for God's pleasure. God will help us on that line.
FROM C.A.C.S NOTES
@Psalm 52: 1 - 9; @Psalm 53: 1 - 6; @Psalm 54: 1 - 7; @Psalm 55: 1 - 23
The Psalms generally have in view the conditions of the last days when the forces of evil are in full activity against the people and testimony of God, and they provide instruction as to the conditions in which the testimony of God will be sustained in the days before the kingdom is established.
Now @Psalm 52 has in view the utter disregard of what is priestly and a readiness to destroy it. Doeg represents those
{327}
who serve man in the flesh -- "Chief of the shepherds that belong to Saul" -- and who are prepared to kill what is priestly -- "Eighty-five persons who wore the linen ephod". (Penitential @Psalm 6, @Psalm 32, @Psalm 38, @Psalm 51, @Psalm 102, @Psalm 130, @Psalm 143.) No doubt he represents the antichrist who has no appreciation whatever of God's anointed, and who is prepared to destroy all that is holy. The more we appreciate Christ according to @Psalm 45 the more we shall feel the power of the mighty man here in opposition. "Many false prophets", "Ye ... have overcome them, because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world" (@1 John 4: 1, 4). We learn to judge all the evil of our flesh in @Psalm 51. The true appreciation of Christ always carries with it most profound self-judgment. We have to learn the truth of @Psalm 51, and when we do we understand the loving-kindness of God. It is literally desire or ardour indicating the warmth of God's disposition towards men, notwithstanding their sinful state. Now that loving-kindness abides continually to be the sustainment of His saints even at the time of antichrist.
"A green olive-tree in the house of God" is a beautiful designation of a saint. @Psalm 37: 35 is seen in antichrist. The olive-tree suggests a spiritual man yielding spiritual fruit: he is in the house of God. "Those that are planted in the house of Jehovah shall flourish in the courts of our God" (@Psalm 92: 13). Now our souls are either in our native soil or in that loving-kindness of God which is the soil on which His house stands. How good to be planted there: not visiting the house, but planted there. We are always in God's house where He dwells in loving-kindness. "How precious is thy lovingkindness, O God! So the sons of men take refuge under the shadow of thy wings. They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou wilt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures" (@Psalm 36: 7, 8). The antichrist is the full-blown expression of what man can be for himself, but the house of God is where it is known what God can be for men in loving-kindness.
{328}
@Psalm 53 is the state of men universally, so that every influence that emanates from man tends to eat up God's people. Unfaithfulness has brought God's people into captivity. It is a time to look for salvation out of Zion and for the captivity to be turned. "The deliverer shall come out of Zion; he shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob" (@Romans 11: 26). If the Lord actually appeared, His people would be delivered from everything contrary to Himself. But now the deliverance is being realised anticipatively; in sovereign mercy God is delivering His people. He shows you that something in your walk or ways or your religious convictions is not according to Himself. It is "salvations", one after another, so the captivity is turned and here joy becomes the portion of the Israel of God.
@Psalm 54 is a time of violent opposition, but faith counts upon God as its Helper so that the service of God -- what is due to Him in sacrifice and praise -- may not be hindered. Satan will do his utmost to hinder us from freely sacrificing. You may be overweighted with pressures, cares and exercises: I have to pull myself up as to my prayers oftentimes.
@Psalm 55 is the testing of church troubles. Did you never wish you had wings like a dove? It is violence and strife in the city, on its walls and in its midst: referring to the rebellion of Absalom no doubt. The counsel of Ahithophel was in those days as if a man enquired of the word of God: a brother of great weight and wisdom, as we should say, but falling under a natural influence perhaps, for he was the grandfather of Bathsheba. "Cast thy burden upon Jehovah, and he will sustain thee: he will never suffer the righteous to be moved ... . But as for me, I will confide in thee".
{329}
FROM THE HOUSE OF BONDAGE TO THE HOUSE OF GOD
@Psalm 66: 1 - 20
The text of this psalm is found in the words, "Come and see the works of God" (verse 5). It presents to us in outline the history of the work of God for His saints and in them, and it also indicates the nature and end of His ways with His people. It shows how we are brought from the house of bondage to the house of God -- a progress which begins with the knowledge of redemption, and ends in praise and worship in God's house, and in the soul being formed in moral suitability to Him.
I trust every one here has been "enlightened" (@Hebrews 10: 32) by the grace of God, and brought into the peace and joy of redemption. This is brought before us in verse 6 of our psalm, "He turned the sea into dry land; ... there did we rejoice in him". This clearly alludes to the passage of the Red Sea. It is impossible for any soul to make spiritual progress until redemption is known, and God believed in as a Justifier and Saviour God.
Death is a deep and awful sea which engulfs everything; man has no standing there. But in the death of Christ it is turned into dry land, so that it is now the firmest ground that anyone can set his feet upon.
If Jesus our Lord has been delivered for our offences and raised again for our justification, it is the most blessed witness that God is for us in righteousness, grace, power and love. At the Red Sea, God was for His people against all their enemies. Whichever way the people looked -- at the dry land on which they walked, at the waters which were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left, at the cloud which overshadowed them -- they saw the evidence that God
{330}
was for them. He was between them and their foes -- their protection from every evil.
God is for us against every creature that would seek to hinder Him from carrying out His purposes of blessing in regard to His saints. God is for the believer against all the power of evil -- omnipotence is on his side against every foe. Every Israelite who put the blood of the lamb on his doorpost and lintel fell in with the righteousness of God. There was a necessity for death as the ground on which alone He could take up His people for blessing. Having taken this ground, God could be for them against all their foes.
I trust you have recognised that the death of Christ alone could be your shelter from judgment. But it may be you are not yet out of the region of Pharaoh's power. You are conscious of a thousand imperfections in yourself, and the discovery of these imperfections causes you many an unhappy hour, and suggests many a doubt and misgiving to your mind. You will never be free from these doubts and misgivings until you see that your righteousness and place with God are set forth in Christ. But when you see this it will settle every question, and put your soul altogether beyond the reach of the enemy. You have to pass through the sea by faith.
Let me put this matter in a very simple way. Suppose you were to die and to pass the judgment-throne, and that you found yourself on the other side of death and judgment without a stain of sin upon you, and not only "whiter than snow", but in all the acceptance and beauty of Christ, and with the smile of God's eternal favour beaming upon you, would you not be sure that every question was settled? Would you not be able to say, 'Thank God, this is the beginning of a blissful eternity'? Would you not be assured of the love and favour of God?
Well, now, let me turn your eye to another Person. You are not actually beyond death and judgment, but *Christ* is. In deep, divine love he entered into death and bore the judgment of God. He "was delivered for our offences, and raised
{331}
again for our justification". All that was due to us passed upon Him; He has endured and exhausted it all, so that the believer can sing,
<blockquote>'Death and judgment are behind me'. </blockquote>
And now Christ is our righteousness; we are received by God in all His acceptance. Thus we enter into everlasting favour. We think not of ourselves, but of Christ. I am not beyond death and judgment, but *Christ* is, and I am entitled to know by faith that He was raised for my justification. What a blessed answer to every doubt and fear is found in that risen Christ!
If you read @Romans 4 and 5 you will see how wondrously God has wrought that we might know Him and trust Him as the God of our salvation. We believe on God "who has raised from among the dead Jesus our Lord". It was God who gave Him to die; and when all the blessed work of atonement was finished, God raised Him from the dead for our justification, so that being "justified on the principle of faith" we might have "peace towards God through our Lord Jesus Christ". God has settled every question in His own way and at His own cost. We believe on God; it is not only that we believe texts of Scripture, but we believe on God.
We believe on God (@Romans 4: 24); we have peace towards God (@Romans 5: 1); we are reconciled to God (@Romans 5: 10); we boast in God (@Romans 5: 11).
These four things give us in a very full and blessed way the portion of the believer. God is the Object of his faith and the Source of his joy. He knows the meaning of the words, "He turned the sea into dry land: ... there did we rejoice in him".
Now I want to call your attention to the interesting fact that the word "flood" in this verse (Authorised Version) is really "river"; so that the verse reads, "He turned the sea into dry land; they went through the river on foot". That is, this verse brings together the thought of the Red Sea and the
{332}
Jordan. It has often been pointed out that in God's purpose the two coalesce, though in the ways of God the wilderness came between. From @Exodus 3: 8 we see that the thought of God was to bring His people *out of* Egypt *into* Canaan. If He brought them out of the sphere of bondage it was that He might bring them into the sphere of blessing. We may be satisfied with the *relief* side of the gospel, but it is deeply important that we should go on to apprehend the *purpose* side. It is just as much in God's mind that we should come into fullest blessing as that we should come out of condemnation and bondage. In other words it is as much God's pleasure that we should be "risen with Christ" as that we should be justified.
The death of Christ clears us of everything that was against us as children of Adam, so that Christ risen is our righteousness. This answers to the Red Sea. But, on the other hand, the same precious death that clears us opens the way for us to be introduced to life and blessing in association with Christ according to God's purpose. This answers to the Jordan.
There was a marked difference between the Red Sea and the Jordan. At the former the people learned God's salvation for them in presence of all the power of the enemy, but at the latter the one object present to their view was the ark of the covenant (see @Joshua 3). The people crossed the Jordan as being in association with the ark. It was no longer a question of protection from the power of evil, for there was neither water nor enemy in sight, but of association with the ark.
The word "for" occurs many times in Romans (see @Romans 4: 25; @Romans 5: 6, 8; @Romans 8: 26, 27, 31, 32, 34), but in Colossians the characteristic word is "with" (see @Colossians 2: 12, 13, 20; @Colossians 3: 1, 3, 4). If we enter into the land of God's purpose it must be as in association with Christ, who is dead and risen.
It is entirely outside all that belongs to flesh, or to life in this world. A dead and risen man has severed all his links with things here, and lives in another order of things altogether.
I do not enlarge upon this, but I should like each one to see that in the mind of God the two things go together -- that His
{333}
saints should be justified, and that they should be risen with Christ.
Then in verses 8 and 9 of our psalm we get the wilderness. "Bless our God, ye peoples, and make the voice of his praise to be heard; Who hath set our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved". If we are in the light of God's love and purpose we shall be assured that He will care for us in the wilderness. There was no resource in the wilderness but God, and He did not fail His people. They failed, but God did not cease to care for them, to give them bread from heaven, and water from the flinty rock, and to preserve them so that, though wandering forty years in a desert, they became neither ragged nor footsore.
Joshua and Caleb did not murmur; they were in the wilderness according to God, and had true wilderness experience -- that is, experience of a faithful and forbearing love that never turned aside. They found that the manna and the rock sufficed for every need, and at the end of the journey, with 'Garments fresh and foot unweary', they could tell how God had brought them through. *Flesh* was proved in the wilderness and found worthless, but *faith* proved what God was and found Him faithful. Joshua and Caleb might well have said to the people, "Bless our God, ye peoples, and make the voice of his praise to be heard". Flesh fills the wilderness with murmurings, but faith fills it with praise.
It is a great thing to be assured of God's care. He says, "Let your conversation be without love of money, satisfied with your present circumstances; for *he* has said, I will not leave thee, neither will I forsake thee. So that, taking courage, we may say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not be afraid: What will man do unto me?" (@Hebrews 13: 5, 6). God is our Resource, not worldly possessions. If we look upon things here as our resource we shall want to increase them as much as possible, and covetousness will come in.
There are times coming when saints will be put under great pressure. Satan will seek to make it impossible for them to get a living unless they identify themselves with what is
{334}
opposed to God. But in those times God will not fail His people.
There may be persecution and trial in many ways-we may have to go "through fire and through water" (verse 12) -- but we may boldly say, "The Lord is my helper, and I will not be afraid: what will man do unto me". God triumphs in redemption first, and then He makes his saints triumphant in the wilderness (see @Romans 8: 31 - 39). The Holy Spirit marshals the whole array of the power of evil, and shows the saint triumphant in presence of it all. "In all these things we more than conquer through him that has loved us" (verse 37).
In the wilderness we are *preserved* and *proved*. God preserves us that we may learn what He is, and He proves us that we may learn what we are. The wilderness is the place of discipline, but it is also where we prove God's blessed care and mercy. We learn in the wilderness to sing @Psalm 136, "his loving-kindness endureth for ever". In connection with this read @1 Corinthians 10: 13, "God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able to bear, but will with the temptation make the issue also, so that ye should be able to bear it". While suffering His people to be tested and proved so that they may learn what the flesh is, God is faithful to consider the weakness of His saints. If you cannot stand a severe testing you will not have it, or if suffered to have it you will have special succour and consideration. God will test and prove His saints, but He will not allow them to be crushed.
There are two things we may count on: the purpose of God and the love of Christ. God is bringing us as many sons to glory, and there is One at His right hand interceding for us in love. We have to take heed that we do not depart from the sense of this. "See, brethren, lest there be in any one of you a wicked heart of unbelief, in turning away from the living God" (@Hebrews 3: 12).
In the wilderness we learn the faithfulness and loving kindness of God, and the love of Christ which never fails.
Then we have also to learn there the utter worthlessness of
{335}
the flesh; we cannot bring the flesh into the blessing of God, nor connect divine purpose and blessing with it. In the wilderness we learn experimentally what the flesh is, so as to come into concert with God's mind about it, that in result we may be freed from it in spirit so as to enter consciously into association with Christ.
It is in view of this we get the provings of God. "For thou, O God, hast proved us; thou hast tried us, as silver is tried. Thou broughtest us into a net, thou didst lay a heavy burden upon our loins; Thou didst cause men to ride over our head; we went through fire and through water" (@Psalm 66: 10 - 12). God subjects us to testing that the true character of the flesh may be discovered to us. When silver is tried the dross is brought to the surface that it may be removed. God does not prove us that *He* may find out what we are but that *we* may find it out. The Lord knew very well how little Simon was to be depended on, but Simon did not know it, so he had to be sifted as wheat (@Luke 22: 31). He thought he could stand any test, but when he was put in the crucible the dross came to the surface.
When we are under testing we are often inclined to blame our circumstances, our surroundings, and a thousand things rather than to judge ourselves. But in the end God brings home to us that it is *ourselves* as in the flesh who are all wrong. When God brings us into His net we cannot escape. Many a backslider and self-willed believer has had to prove the truth of what He said to backsliding Ephraim -- "When they go, I will spread my net upon them" (@Hosea 7: 12).
"We went through fire and through water". Fire tests everything; wood, hay, and stubble will not stand. What is the good of ideas and phraseology in a day of testing? Sooner or later God burns self-sufficiency and self-satisfaction out of His people. Then water is a figure of death. It is a solemn thing to pass through death -- to be made to realise that there is not an atom of anything in us, that is, in our flesh, for God. Most believers will admit that they are not what they ought to be; they are conscious of failure and imperfections, and
{336}
they strive against this, and pray for grace to be more consistent, but they do not seem to learn fully that in them, that is, in their flesh, good does not dwell.
At the end of thirty-eight years in the wilderness the children of Israel were as bad as the first day they entered it. They "spoke against God, and against Moses" (@Numbers 21: 5).
"Then Jehovah sent fiery serpents among the people, which bit the people; and much people of Israel died" (verse 6). Death passed upon them. Man incorrigibly bad must be rejected by God. Do you find that the grace of God improves you? Nay, you find still the evidences of an unalterable depravity in your flesh. You may try to get over it by confession of your faults and failings, but this does not lead to any improvement. You have to learn that it is not this or that which needs to be corrected, but that yourself -- the source of all the evil -- must go in judgment from before God. When you arrive at this you are just on the verge of an "abundance" (@Psalm 66: 12). You are prepared to see the serpent lifted up -- to see in the death of Christ the condemnation and removal of sin in the flesh.
All the exercise -- the going through fire and through water -- is to bring us to see the absolute necessity for the death of Christ as the end of our history before God. If God brings the dross to the surface in the experience of our souls it is that we may learn how He has removed it all in the death of Christ.
"Unless ye shall have eaten the flesh of the Son of man, and drunk his blood, ye have no life in yourselves" (@John 6: 53). We have to appropriate the death of Christ as that which brings to an end all that we are, while at the same time it expresses in the most blessed way the love of God. We are freed from ourselves by the death of Christ that we might live in the love that freed us. Beloved brethren, have we reached the point that we delight to appropriate the death of Christ in this way?
Then, again, we read, "*He* also who eats me shall live also on account of me" (@John 6: 57). Not only has He come into
{337}
death to remove all that we are, and to bring divine love into a place where we can feed upon it in the most blessed way, but He came here to bring all that is heavenly and divine within reach of our hearts in Himself that we might feed on it, and be formed by it -- that it might become the life of our souls.
In this way we come into an "abundance". "Thou hast brought us out into abundance" (@Psalm 66: 12). We see there is a life to which no condemnation can possibly attach, but it is in Another, not in ourselves. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus; He gives us the consciousness that in Christ Jesus we are as completely to God's satisfaction as we were to His dissatisfaction in the flesh. "The water which I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life" (@John 4: 14). How blessed to have this well of living water springing up in the soul and carrying us in spirit and affection into the region of divine love, "The love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord" (@Romans 8: 39).
Is not this a place of "abundance"? The footnote (d) reads, 'Runneth over'. @Psalm 23: 5 is the same word. Those who submit to God's provings, and learn the necessity and import of Christ's death, enter into this, "But the rebellious dwell in a parched land" (@Psalm 68: 6). In the place of abundance we are clear of all the dross because we have appropriated the death of Christ to free us from the flesh, and now we feed on that blessed One and are identified with Him in life before His God and Father, and this constitutes us a worshipping company.
"I will go into thy house with burnt-offerings; ... I will offer up unto thee burnt-offerings of fatted beasts, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats" (@Psalm 66: 13, 15). We come before God and the Father identified with all the perfections of Christ, and those perfections become in our hearts material for praise by the Spirit. We are in the sweet savour of Christ and His sacrifice. There may be different measures in which this is apprehended by saints -- one
{338}
may have, in figure, a bullock, another a sheep, and another a turtle-dove or a pigeon (see @Leviticus 1) -- but that which is apprehended is the same for all. It is the excellence, preciousness, and perfection of Christ. "Through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father" (@Ephesians 2: 18). God would have us to come near to Him in conscious identification with Christ. The youngest saint of God is entitled to lose sight of himself in God's presence, and to be absorbed with Christ. The provings of the wilderness prepare us to come to what God has already reached in Christ and by His death -- that we may be in spirit free from the flesh and happy in the presence of God. It is not possible to be in presence of God known in grace and love -- in presence of the Father and the Son -- without being worshippers. Worship is the appreciation of divine Persons, and that in creatures must be adoration. It is not that we bring anything to God, but our souls bow before Him in adoring appreciation of Himself as made known to us in His beloved Son. It is the attitude our souls take in presence of what God has made known of Himself to our hearts.
Then the one who has been constituted a worshipper is competent for testimony. "Come, hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul" (@Psalm 66: 16). There is beautiful moral order in this. The soul is brought into the blessedness of approach to God according to His own grace and revelation of Himself. He has learned God in the triumph of redemption, in His faithfulness in the wilderness, and in the favour of His house, and now he is competent to declare what God has done for him.
There are four characteristic features of the house of God: (1) Satisfaction. "They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house" (@Psalm 36: 8). God brings His saints near to Himself to satisfy them with that in which He finds His own pleasure -- with all that subsists in Christ His beloved Son.
(2) Testimony. This I have already referred to.
(3) Holiness. "Had I regarded iniquity in my heart, the
{339}
Lord would not hear" (@Psalm 66: 18). "Holiness becometh thy house, O Jehovah, for ever" (@Psalm 93: 5). As we feed upon the fatness of God's house we are taken up with what is pure, and lovely, and of good report, and we become formed in suitability to God. We are separated in heart and mind from what is evil. Much that passes for holiness at the present day stands completely discredited in presence of Scripture. It is no uncommon thing to find people professing a high degree of sanctification, and yet going on with much that is contrary to God's mind in both doctrine and practice. This is a very poor kind of holiness.
(4) Dependence. "But God hath heard; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer" (@Psalm 66: 19). In connection with right behaviour in the house of God, Paul says, "I will therefore that the men pray in every place, lifting up pious hands, without wrath or reasoning" (@1 Timothy 2: 8). We cannot be maintained in satisfaction, holiness or testimony apart from prayerful dependence. A redeemed, satisfied, holy, and dependent people can bear witness to the grace and faithfulness of God, and can give a true testimony to what He is, and what He has done for them, because they know Him and have had blessed experience of His perfect ways. If at the beginning of the wilderness we are called to "Come and see the works of God", at the end thereof we can but exclaim with praise, "What hath God wrought!" (@Numbers 23: 23).
{340}
THE CUP OF SALVATION
@Psalm 116: 3, 13; @Psalm 73: 10, 12; @Matthew 23: 23 - 26; @Psalm 75: 8; @Psalm 11: 6; @Isaiah 51: 17; @Matthew 26: 39
Before I say anything about the cup of salvation I should like to call your attention to some other cups of which Scripture speaks. Asaph says, "I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked"; "Waters of a full cup are wrung out to them"; "Behold these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world" (@Psalm 73: 3, 10, 12). I call this *the cup of worldly prosperity*.
Many a one has been in the same perplexity as the psalmist. He saw the peace, plenty, and prosperity of the foolish and wicked. He was conscious of his own integrity before God, and yet he was plagued all the day long and chastened every morning, while they were going on without a sorrow or a care. They were prosperous, they were not in trouble nor plagued like other men, their eyes stood out with fatness, they had more than heart could wish, waters of a full cup of prosperity were wrung out to them in life, and they had no bands in their death. It almost stumbled this dear saint of God to see this; he could not understand it until he went into the sanctuary and saw it in the light of God's presence, and learnt there that this world is not the place to see the righteous government of God.
Sin has come into the world, transforming man from a loyal subject into a rebel against God. This world is in a state of revolt -- the claims of God, its rightful Sovereign, are disowned, and rebellious man has assumed the crown and sceptre. So far as we know, in all the vast universe of God this tiny planet is the only dark spot where Home Rule has been established -- the rule of a puny creature who has dared to set at defiance the sovereign rights of God. Before long God will come in to reassert His rights in power and crush
{341}
the rebellion, but for the present He leaves the world in the hands of the rebels while He sends messengers of mercy to offer pardon and peace to every guilty wretch who will lay down his arms and be reconciled to God. We read, "The earth is given into the hand of the wicked" (@Job 9: 24). Then if that be the case worldly peace and prosperity is no proof of the favour of God. If this city was to rebel against the Queen and raise the standard of revolt, the man who was happy and content to remain in it would be deemed not to be a very loyal subject of Her Majesty. The fact that a man was true to the Queen would make him a target for the persecution and enmity of the others. So we are told that "all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution", and the more brightly and fully a man shows his colours for God, the more will he provoke the enmity of the world.
Then it follows that the more contented and prosperous a man is in the world, the less likely is he to accept the offered pardon. There is no evil in worldly prosperity in itself, any more than there is rebellion in the pavement of this city, but if that pavement was torn up by the rebellious people and made into barricades to resist the Queen it would become the instrument of a very great evil. Men use their prosperity *to exclude God* from their thoughts, and when this is the case, and the more full a man's cup is, the greater the danger of his damnation. The cup of prosperity makes a man drunken with forgetfulness of God until "they are brought into desolation, as in a moment!"
Remember the rich man of whom the Lord Jesus spoke. His cup was full and running over; he had no place to bestow his fruits and his goods. God was forgotten. He thought of nothing but his prosperity until he was "brought into desolation, as in a moment", and his full cup was dashed to the ground by the words, "Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee". Look at those three men who were invited to the great supper of grace. A piece of ground filled the cup of one; five yoke of oxen filled the cup of another; and the joys of the honeymoon filled the cup of the third. These were
{342}
not bad things in themselves, but the sad part of it was that the men were so satisfied with their full cups that *they slighted the invitation of grace*. Satisfied worldling, drinking thy full cup of pleasure or prosperity, listen to the awful words which fell from the lips of the insulted Giver of the feast! "I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper" (@Luke 14: 24).
In @Matthew 23 the Lord Jesus speaks of another cup when He says, "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess". God's description of the heart of man in @Jeremiah 17 is that it is "deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked". No human pen or tongue could give a faithful description of that chamber of horrors -- the heart of man. The concentrated essence of everything that is vile can be found there. Every desire that is earthly, sensual and devilish finds board and lodging in the heart of man. It is, as its Searcher has plainly said, "desperately wicked". But let it be understood that the heart has no wish to be suspected of such horrors, and being "deceitful above all things" it is able to assume many a fair disguise, and by false pretences to deceive others and even itself. So it comes to pass that an immense number of people are like the cup of @Matthew 23, which I call *the cup of profession*; that is, the inside and the outside belie each other.
These scribes and Pharisees were to all appearances the most clean, holy, religious people in the world. They were most particular, even to the tithing of their mint and anise and cummin. They said their prayers with the greatest regularity; they read the Scriptures constantly; they never omitted to attend the services at the temple and in the synagogues; and yet the Lord Jesus said unto them, "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees"! Instead of owning the corruption of their hearts, and humbling themselves in true repentance before God, they were seeking to hide it by an outside parade of morality and religion. They were making the outside
{343}
of the cup clean, while within was extortion, excess, and all uncleanness.
All the morality and religion in the world without the cleansing of the precious blood of Christ is only like the snow on a dunghill, hiding the corruption which it does not remove. The paint on a rotten ship, the veneer on a worthless piece of furniture, the gilding on a counterfeit sovereign, all go for something *until the truth is discovered*, and morality and religion in the life, without Christ and the blood for the soul, are nothing more than these. Oh the shame and contempt that will be the portion of thousands in the all-revealing day when the inside of the cup shall be examined in the light of God at the great white throne!
There are two places where your sins may be hidden: *in your own bosom* or *under the blood of Christ*. Job declared that he had not covered his transgressions after the manner of men by hiding his iniquity in his bosom (@Job 31: 33). Your iniquity may be hidden from the sight of men in your bosom -- in the inside of the cup -- while you present a fair, attractive exterior; but the day speeds on in which God will judge not only your works and words but the secrets of your heart, and if you now hide your iniquity *there*, depend upon it, it will all be found there to your everlasting confusion. Better, better far, to come to God by Jesus Christ, owning all the pollution and folly and wickedness which defiles your heart, saying to that God-provided Saviour of sinners,
<blockquote>'Just as I am -- and waiting not <br>To rid my soul of one dark blot, <br>To Thee, whose blood can cleanse each spot, <br>O Lamb of God, I come!' (`446:3)</blockquote>
Washed in that precious blood, you will be *in God's sight* "whiter than snow". No longer then a mere professor, making a fair show in the flesh while the soul's deep stains of sin are unremoved, you will be justified by grace, apparelled in divine righteousness, and made complete in Christ; so that
{344}
if infinite holiness searches you it will be only to find that infinite love has removed in righteousness every stain of sin.
Those who are satisfied with the cup of prosperity or of profession may perhaps be aroused when they hear that another awaits them, even *the cup of judgment*. "For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup ... the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them"
(@Psalm 75: 8). "Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup" (@Psalm 11: 6).
Satan is seeking to make men believe that there is no judgment, and the thought is so comfortable that we can hardly wonder at many embracing it, though we do not envy the pleasant dream which will have so rude an awakening. It is becoming the fashion of modern preachers to avoid speaking of judgment, or at any rate to so tone down its terribleness that people are fast forgetting God's majesty and holiness, and that "our God is a consuming fire". Modern theology has made the wonderful discovery that sinners do not like to be told that they are in danger of hell fire, that they must turn or burn, that they must be converted or damned; and theology has been busy trimming its sails, and altering its course so as to catch the breeze of popularity, and there is every reason to suppose, from the drift of matters at present, that by and by the orthodox gospel will be, 'Believe whatever you like, and do what is right in your own eyes, and you will be saved'.
But the Word of God cuts right across these modern theories, and it speaks of "fire and brimstone and a burning tempest" as the portion of the cup of the ungodly. Seven times in the New Testament do we read the words, "there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth", and this from the lips of the Son of God Himself. Sinner, this will be your portion as sure as you exist, except you repent and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. I do not know what is your feeling about it, but I recall the time when the thought of this used to make my blood run cold until I shivered with fear, and my
{345}
heart quaked until it seemed as if it would break loose from its fleshy cell to flee from judgment so well deserved. That was drinking another cup which we find in @Isaiah 51: 17.
"Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the Lord the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out". Those who drink *the cup of trembling now*, escape the cup of judgment *then*; but those who do not have the one are sure to have the other. "To this man will I look, saith the Lord, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word" (@Isaiah 66: 2). The proud heart steels itself against the word of God, and refuses to tremble. The *convicted sinner*, when he hears the word, comes in trembling like the jailer at Philippi, and says, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?" Have you tasted this cup of trembling? Have its bitter dregs gone down into your soul, causing you to say with David, "My flesh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy judgments"? Saul was drinking it when "he trembling ... said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" (@Acts 9: 6). The woman in @Luke 8 was drinking it when she came trembling and fell down before Jesus. May God give you the cup of trembling now, that you may never have to drink the cup of judgment in the terrible coming day!
See how God deals with the trembling sinner in @Isaiah 51: 22. "Thus saith thy Lord the Lord, and thy God that pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again". Precious grace! God Himself draws near to remove every cause of fear from the trembling sinner. The moment you accept that cup as your portion God draws near to take it away. He takes it out of your trembling hand and says, "Thou shalt no more drink it again".
But what is to be done with that cup? Is nobody to drink it? Are your sins simply to be passed over and forgotten? No! eternal justice refuses to lend her high sanction to any such evasion of judgment. The cup *must* be drunk. And if it
{346}
is taken out of the hand of the sinner, it is put into the hand of the Saviour where it becomes *the cup of substitution*. "And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt" (@Matthew 26: 39).
What a sight is before us here! The Son of God, become a Man in perfect grace that He might in suffering and death atone for sin, is seen approaching the wondrous crisis of Calvary. He has spoken His last words of love to His poor sorrowing disciples, and He turns from them to His Father for a brief moment of communion in view of the cross. Satan seizes the opportunity, and having been completely foiled when he presented all that was fair and attractive to tempt the Saviour from His path of obedience at the commencement of His ministry, he now confronts Him with all the terrors of the cross. The veil is lifted, and we are permitted to see Him under this last assault of the enemy. He sees the cup. He measures its depth. He knows its bitterness; and he prays, "O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me"! He shrank from it -- He could not but shrink from it. His very perfection as the peerlessly spotless Man made Him shrink from it. His perfect knowledge of the holy judgment with which sin must be visited, His nearness to God, would have been belied if every sensibility of His holy soul had not shrunk from that unspeakable cup.
Ah! my friends, Calvary's work was no mockery of justice; it was no stage-play of substitution; the Son of God did there really and actually take upon Him the innumerable sins of believers, and every pang of sorrow, every stroke of judgment which was due to those sins He endured in His own body on the tree.
<blockquote>'O! for this love let rocks and hills <br>Their lasting silence break; <br>And all harmonious human tongues <br>The Saviour's praises speak'. </blockquote>
{347}
It was all this that was pressed upon Him in the garden, and the prospect of it forced the sweat of blood from His brow and caused His holy form to be prostrated in an agony of prayer. Yet this terrible ordeal only served as a dark background to show out in greater brilliancy the submission, the obedience, the devotedness, and the love of His heart. He said, "Not as I will, but as thou wilt". "O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done" (@Matthew 26: 42). "The cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?" (@John 18: 11). He took the cup from His Father's hand, and He bore it to the cross. What the drinking of that cup involved will ever be to us an unknown mystery of suffering. We stand afar off and we hear the shout of triumph which pierces the darkness from the dying Victor's lips, "It is finished"; and we know that the last bitter dregs of that burning cup have been exhausted.
<blockquote>'*It is finished: all* is over, <br>Sin's dark cup of wrath is drained; <br>Such the truth these words discover, <br>Thus the victory was obtained; <br>Tis a victory <br>None but Jesus could have gained'. </blockquote>
The cup of suffering and substitution has been drained by the Saviour. Now let us look at @Psalm 116 to see what there is for the trembling sinner. Here we find *the cup of salvation*, and the sinner who takes it. Listen to his own account of himself in verse 3: "The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow". It is a mercy when the pains of hell get hold of a man before he gets there, for the people who never suffer the pains of hell in this world will suffer them for all eternity in the next. The outcry of an awakened conscience and the smitings of conviction of sin have given many a man a sharp touch of "the pains of hell". You *may* hush your conscience to sleep now, but the day is coming when it will wake up and speak in
{348}
thunder tones. May God awaken you *now*, while the cup of salvation is still within your reach!
Then, further, this sinner of @Psalm 116 says, "The sorrows of death compassed me". Unsaved man, you cannot look in any direction without seeing death before you. It stares you in the face from every side; you are compassed with it -- a terrible enclosure without a single loophole through which you can escape. And, remember, the circle gets less every day! It is silently closing in upon you, and very soon it will seize you in a vice-like grip, and turn your hands and feet and brain and heart to dust. Oh! what will you do in that solemn hour without a Saviour?
But what have you inside that awful circle of death in which you live? Just what the psalmist had, who said, "I found trouble and sorrow". You may *seek* rest and joy as earnestly as you like, but all that you *will find* is, in the end, trouble and sorrow. Lord Byron did his best to enjoy life, but in the end he had to say,
<blockquote>'My days are in the yellow leaf, <br>The flowers and fruits of life are gone, <br>*The worm, the canker, and the grief* <br>Are mine alone!'</blockquote>
It is the sinner who tells us in verse 3 that the sorrows of death compassed him, that the pains of hell gat hold upon him, and that he found trouble and sorrow, who says in verse 13, "I will take the cup of salvation". There is no reason on God's part why you should not take it today. The cup of salvation is now in the victorious hand of *a risen Saviour* who has passed through the sorrows of death and endured the judgment of God, that He might in righteous grace bring salvation to you. Nothing could be simpler than the gospel message. Here it is: "Through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses" (@Acts 13: 38, 39). God seeks nothing from you; He brings everything to you. He asks you not for works,
{349}
or tears, or prayers. He only wants a listening ear and a believing heart. In short, the terms on which you may have salvation are plainly indicated in the words, "I will *take* the cup of salvation". That is, you must have it not as the reward of works, or even as the answer to earnest prayers, but as a *free gift*.
"The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord" (@Romans 6: 23). The One who drank the bitter cup of death and judgment which our sin had filled is now alive for evermore. He can never again be charged with sin; He is for ever beyond the reach of death and judgment; and every believer has eternal life *in Him*. "This is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life" (@1 John 5: 11, 12). Have you taken this precious gift? Have you believed on the name of the only-begotten Son of God? The grace of God makes you welcome to that risen and glorified Saviour, and to all the blessings that are the fruit of His death. God says, "I *will give* unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life *freely*" (@Revelation 21: 6); and he also says, "Let him that is athirst come: And *whosoever will, let him take* the water of life *freely*" (@Revelation 22: 17).
Then let not the siren voice of the world prevail: let not her "stolen waters" any longer entice your heart; but turn to God and to His beloved Son. Renounce all righteousness of your own, and submit to the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ. Do not delude yourself by the vain thought that you can *work* for salvation or *pay* for it; it is not even needful that you should pray for it. You cannot please God better than by simply *taking* it as His gift. "The grace of God *that bringeth salvation* hath appeared to all men" (@Titus 2: 11). "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved" (@Acts 16: 31). May the language of your heart at this moment be, "I will take the cup of salvation".
Thank God! this cup not only contains pardon and peace, and a sure and certain hope of glory with Christ at His coming,
{350}
but it is *a cup of endless satisfaction*. The worldling's joys are like the crackling of thorns under a pot, or like a strain of music that holds the ear for a moment, and then dies away for ever. The Christian's joys are in the Lord, and they are inexhaustible and eternal. We have a living Saviour in glory who loves us as much today as when He died for us on the cross. We are the treasure of His heart and He delights to manifest Himself to us. His love is better than wine, and when He looks upon us it puts gladness in our hearts that the world knows nothing of. We rejoice in Him with joy unspeakable and full of glory. The Lord is the portion of our cup.
When believers are unsatisfied, it is because they are not living up to their income. They have forsaken the Lord, the fountain of living waters, and they are proving that the cisterns of the world are broken and will hold no water. The hand that never makes a mistake has written over every earthly fountain, "Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again". Backsliding believer, get back to the Lord! The serpent has beguiled you by his subtlety, and turned you aside to earthly things. But your dishonoured Lord loves you still. Go back to Him and tell Him all. Tell Him how you have slighted and forgotten Him; confess your wanderings, unburden to Him all your sorrows and disappointments, and break your heart in contrition at His feet. He will receive, restore, and satisfy your soul.
Just a closing word to another, and a numerous, class of believers. *Your* life and walk are pious and separate from the world. You love the truth of God and would not surrender it for anything. One thing only is lacking, and that is expressed in the word of the sweet singer when he says, "My cup runneth over". If you saw a beautiful fountain -- however elegant was its design, however exquisite its workmanship, and however faultless its material -- you would be disappointed if there was no flow of water. God would have us *overflowing* in praise and worship to Him, and in blessing and refreshment
{351}
to all around. Listen to the words of His beloved Son, "He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water" (@John 7: 38). What is the secret of all these dry fountains? How is it that we yield scanty drops instead of a gushing stream -- thimblefuls instead of rivers? Is it because our hearts are not really full of Christ? He is not the absorbing and satisfying Object of our souls, and hence we are dry.
Worship and service are the overflowings of a heart that is being fed and filled from the inexhaustible Reservoir -- a glorified Christ in heaven. Our coldness and dryness are only the sorrowful proof of how little we are like Naphtali -- "Satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the Lord" (@Deuteronomy 33: 23). May the Lord flood all our hearts afresh with His love, and thus make our cup to be constantly running as Charles Wesley's was when he wrote, over,
<blockquote>'My heart is full of Christ, and longs <br>Its glorious matter to declare! <br>Of Him I make my loftier songs, <br>I cannot from His praise forbear: <br>My ready tongue makes haste to sing <br>The glories of the heavenly King. <br><p>Fairer than all the earth-born race, <br>Perfect in comeliness Thou art; <br>Replenished are Thy lips with grace; <br>And full of love Thy tender heart. <br>God ever blest! I bow the knee, <br>And own all fulness dwells in Thee'. (`328:1)</blockquote>

FROM C.A.C.S NOTES
@Psalm 74
It is to be noticed how the psalm speaks of the assembly, the sanctuary, the tabernacle as being destroyed or profaned. The enemy and the adversary are to be seen active in the sphere of holy things. The carved work broken down with hatchets and hammers -- the beautiful ornamentation which evidenced the presence and activities of the Spirit and the fruit of active spiritual affections in the saints. These things replaced by outward and material splendour, but spiritual beauty defaced and destroyed. There is a call to God to remember His assembly, and to accomplish deliverance. The greatness of the power is dwelt upon -- "Thou".
@Psalm 78
Shows how God established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel, but at every point in the history of His people they were a stubborn and rebellious generation, so that in the end He forsook the tabernacle at Shiloh. But then He falls back upon the principle of sovereignty and sets up the kingdom and the sanctuary on the principle of sovereign mercy, and of the perfection of integrity and skill in the true David -- the Man of divine choice.
@Psalm 88
This is a @Romans 7 psalm: one learning utter weakness so as to be as one dead. It is not will in this psalm but weakness learned under the dealing of God. But this is to teach us to appreciate @Psalm 89.
@Psalm 89
We have Jehovah's loving-kindness and faithfulness celebrated: faithfulness seven times, loving-kindness seven times. His loving-kindness is built up for ever: in the very
{353}
heavens His faithfulness is established: we have to look there. "The heavens shall celebrate thy wonders, O Jehovah, and thy faithfulness in the congregation of the saints" (verse 5).
The covenant made with Christ, Jehovah's Elect; not a single engagement of God to Christ can possibly fail. The kingdom is secured to Him and priesthood (@Psalm 110); "Ask of me" (@Psalm 2); the saints given to Him (@John 10; @John 17). It is blessed to think of transactions between God and His anointed, which cannot be interfered with by the power of I evil.
"I have laid help upon a mighty one". 'I come to do Thy will, when the whole sacrificial system failed' (@Psalm 40: 6, 7). "Then said I". 'I come down from heaven'. He came from God and went to God, accomplishing all that had been entrusted to Him. "I have completed the work" (@John 17: 4). The pleasure of Jehovah prospered in His hand.

THE WORK OF THE LORD
@Psalm 119: 126; @Psalm 102: 13, 14; @Hosea 10: 12
I have read these scriptures having in mind the great importance of the work of the Lord going on, especially in such days as the present. It is sometimes said that those walking in separation do less than others; they are often accused of being idle. But this is evidently not what Scripture has in view in @2 Timothy 2: 21. If we have come truly into separation it is that we might be serviceable to the Master, prepared for every good work. We have separated from what is dishonouring to the Lord that we might do far more in the work of the Lord than we possibly could in the systems of men. There is a great deal of activity in those systems, but they greatly hinder the work of the Lord. Anything systematic tends to kill faith. It is easier to the flesh to work in a human system just because it does not call for faith. But faith wants liberty to move according to its own nature, and its own exercises before God.
The scriptures read show the conditions in which the Lord works, particularly in days of departure. "It is time for Jehovah to work: they have made void thy law". Never was this more true than it is today. Sometimes the very evils that are present tend to discourage faith. Timothy was probably discouraged by the evil around him, for Paul told him to rekindle the gift of God which was in him. But the evil day is just the time for the Lord to work.
Then we see in @Psalm 102 conditions which are favourable to God working. It is when His servants take pleasure in the stones of Zion, and favour her dust. I think it supposes that Zion is in ruins. It is not now her bulwarks, or her towers, or her palaces, but her stones and even her dust. We cannot see the glory of Zion in a public way today, but do we look at the saints as the stones of Zion or, it may even be, as her dust?
{355}
The great movement of around 1830 commenced when a few saints began to think of the saints as of the assembly of God. Mr. Darby said he looked round to see anywhere the communion of the assembly of God, and he could not see it anywhere. I feel sure that if we viewed the saints more as of the assembly of God the Lord would give more of them to us. He would be gracious to Zion; it would be the set time for Him to work.
But then He does not work apart from His saints. So that there is an urgent call to us to be always abounding in the work of the Lord. This was said to the Corinthians -- not a very spiritual assembly -- and one feature of their unspirituality was that they were not working the work of the Lord. If our great care is to work the work of the Lord there will not be much room for what is fleshly. The world will be practically kept out if we are truly and continuously serving the Lord in His work.
But then there must be conditions if we are to be suitable for the work, and Hosea gives the conditions. We must bring ourselves into spiritual cultivation; the fallow ground must be broken up. We often lie untilled and there is no crop of fruitfulness in service for the Lord. Breaking up the fallow ground means that we bring ourselves into a condition which is favourable to the germination and development of what is of God in our own souls. Seeking the Lord is essential to this. Thousands of believers have very little thought of seeking the Lord, but we cannot work His work until we find Him for ourselves.

DEVOTEDNESS
@Proverbs 3: 9, 10
Devotedness is the expression of the fact that the Lord has His right place in our affections. There is very much involved in this, for there may be activity in service, and liberality in the use of one's means, without any true devotedness. But when the Lord is before our hearts we think first of His mind and pleasure, and it becomes our great concern to know what is in His heart for us so that we may enter into it, and thus be in suitability to Himself and His thoughts.
It was a suitable thing that the Israelite who was brought into the land and enriched with its fulness should honour the Lord with his substance and with the first-fruits of all his increase. He was in possession of that which God's purpose and grace had bestowed upon him and the Lord was well pleased to receive the first-fruits, which bore witness that he was in possession and enjoyment of the good land, and that he appreciated the grace which had brought him into it.
It may be good for our hearts to consider where we are as to this elementary feature of true devotedness. Are we in Egypt, trying to do good there by helping all kinds of schemes for the betterment of man's condition in this world? Or are we in a little oasis of our own, carrying on worship and service after our own ideas? Or have we made it our great concern to apprehend the present thought and purpose of God for us? Are we really seeking to enter into and take possession of what He has given, so that we may bring the first-fruits of it to Him? God takes pleasure in our enjoyment and appreciation of that which it has been His great delight
{360}
to give us. It is in proportion as we apprehend the purpose of God, and take possession of the things which He has freely given to us, that we can, in a spiritual sense, honour the Lord with our substance.

UNDER HIS SHADOW
@Song of Songs 2: 3
Many Christians today are suffering from spiritual sunstroke. The sun was made "to rule the day", and is a figure of the influences of the day. Christians who are constantly exposed to the influences that are around us in this world know that these things have a tendency to dry us up and paralyse us spiritually.
What a blessed restorative of spiritual vigour it is, after a long active day of business life, to get away from contact with men and things, and to sit down "under his shadow"! @Isaiah 32 speaks of Him as "the shadow of a great rock in a weary land". Personal sorrows and difficulties, family or business cares, and perhaps worldly temptations or persecutions crowd in upon you; and your spiritual freshness is not quite what it used to be. You *need* to sit down under His shadow, and the way is open for you to go to that sweet retreat and find there how He refreshes your soul.
Then there is not only shelter but abiding satisfaction to be found in thus sitting under His shadow. "His fruit was sweet to my taste". All the present grace of His heart, and all the activity and outcome of that grace, and all the deep perfections of His adorable Person become the food and satisfaction of our souls. It is there, too, that we learn His mind and pleasure, and acquire a sense of what is suited to Him. We must know what it is to *sit down* before we *stand up* and *run forth* to serve. It is impossible to overestimate the importance of this training for service. Mary of Bethany is an example of this, familiar to everyone. She "sat at Jesus feet, and heard his word", and thus was she prepared for the most precious service that ever was rendered to Him.
{364}
Beloved young Christians, are you in the secret, personal history of your own souls tasting the joy of sitting down under His shadow? Are you finding continual satisfaction in Himself? If so, you will not want religious novels or worldly entertainments -- you will not be found going in for things on the ground that there is 'no harm' in them -- you will not be in any way dependent for happiness on the sin-stained streams of earth. Five minutes under His shadow affords more real delight than a lifetime of pleasures of the earth or of the world.
How differently we shall estimate our lives when we look back over them from the judgment-seat of Christ! How we shall judge as supreme folly the way in which we have allowed our hearts to be carried off by little things that were not worth a thought -- the way in which we have allowed the devil to deceive us and occupy us with earthly things (cares as well as pleasures) when we might have had a portion like this! May the Lord truly draw our hearts more after Himself!

NOTES OF A READING
@Isaiah 1: 1 - 19
C.A.C. In Matthew the Lord deals very much with the moral conditions according to God. We have also the presentation of what was positive in Emmanuel, and the state of things that would be set up in connection with Him, "the kingdom of the heavens", and the future kingdom set up in power. And in the gospel there is a prophetic outline of the future, the Lord Himself being the great Prophet, and prophesying that line of things in chapters 24 and 25. So that there is a certain correspondence in all these things and what comes out in Isaiah.
Rem. Isaiah means 'Salvation of Jah' (see footnote).
C.A.C. The state of the people is the dark background to set forth the lustre of what would come in for God. It is so throughout Scripture. We see it in the epistles. We have only two positive epistles: Romans and Ephesians. That is, Romans gives the truth of the glad tidings, positively, and Ephesians the truth of the assembly, not contemplating departure from it. The departure becomes instruction in the epistles.
The Scriptures are simple if we are simple, and if we have got away from God and Christ and the Spirit, the way of recovery is the same as for Israel -- self-judgment, repentance and turning to God -- and He is quite as ready to undertake the whole matter, is He not?
It should be our great exercise to be among the small residue, for there is that found today, as it was then. Verse 9: Jehovah gets the credit for it all. There is a vast amount of truth today publicly available, but comparatively few, those really in exercise, have benefited by it. Verse 6 shows they
{368}
are full of the weals of God's chastening, but none the better for it. @2 Timothy 2: 22: is that not the preservative? "Pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart". If Christians were to move on the line of ceasing to do evil and learning to do well, they would get on all right. It is a scripture that was powerfully used in the revival over one hundred years ago. J. N. Darby's pamphlet, *Separation from Evil: God's Principle of Unity* is on the same line. Souls begin to move when they begin to act on this principle. "Cease to do evil"; that is, what is not in line with the truth, the mind of God, is to be withdrawn from. If we name the name of the Lord, we are to withdraw from iniquity, which simply means what is not right. It is natural to man to put religious observances in place of what is morally right before God -- what would be pleasing to God. We get first the moral cleansing in verses 16, 17; then in verse 18 Jehovah undertakes that they shall be judicially cleansed. Does not that verse show that God is ready to reason with His people when they are ready? And even with men; it is a wonderful attitude for Him to take up. And ought we not to be prepared to move on that line? We ourselves should be on the line of reasoning when Christians are going on lines that are displeasing to God. @2 Timothy 2: 24, 25 says, "A bondman of the Lord ought ..." to be "forbearing; in meekness setting right those who oppose". I have not learnt that lesson yet! If God is moving on this line with us, we should be on that line with others.
Jehovah was prepared to cleanse them completely, though their sins might be of a most glaring character. Red is a colour difficult to bleach; Jehovah proposes to bleach them thoroughly. It shows how God loves to remove every stain; it is no pleasure to Him to fix a stain on us. He gives His people not only a purged conscience, but a *perfected* conscience.
Ques. What is the difference?
C.A.C. It says in Hebrews, "By one offering he has perfected in perpetuity the sanctified" (chapter 10: 14), and it says they are perfected as to the conscience. Christians are
{369}
entitled to be as perfected in their consciences as if they were already in heaven.
Rem. "I, I am He that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake" (@Isaiah 43: 25).
C.A.C. Oh! He cannot bear anything that holds us from coming near to Him.
Rem. We are as clear as if it had never been written in the book.
C.A.C. And it is the blessed God that has done it. Someone has said,
<blockquote>'With conscience clear as heaven's unclouded day <br>Thy courts I enter in'. </blockquote>
Rem. A man stands up with a clear record -- nothing at all against him.
C.A.C. The worshipper "once purged has no more conscience of sins"; that is, he is no more conscious of sins in the presence of God than if he had never committed one. And it is a thing that stands permanently. It is not the past sins blotted out, and then a new list! We are committed to the grace of God and of Christ, and the power of the Spirit. It has been effected once for all by our Saviour on the cross, and that stands to eternity. All our sins were future when Christ died; and God who knew them laid them on Him, and if one was omitted I should be lost eternally. Not seeing this makes for a careless walk and indifference to sins. The whiteness of the snow and the wool is permanent; it can never be altered. It is a very great proposal on God's part.
{370}
THE WORK OF GOD
@Isaiah 28: 23 - 29
C.A.C. We have presented here in a figurative way the work of God in His people, looked at from the side of His own sovereign operations. The scripture ends with, "He is wonderful in counsel, great in wisdom". I conceive it would help us very much spiritually to understand that something is going on, by the grace and power of God, in our souls which is wonderful and excellent in its character. Things as seen here stand rather in contrast with the way they are presented in New Testament scriptures which often come under our notice; that is, in the parable of the sower. Things are presented there in connection with responsibility, and the prosperity of the seed depends on the character of the ground upon which it falls; therefore there is not altogether a pure result. @Isaiah 28 presents the same figure of sowing and its fruits, but presents it from the divine side, from the side of divine sovereignty. So there is a result for the pleasure of God, and for the satisfaction and deep blessing of His people. I thought it might help to look at that.
Ques. You mean here it is what God purposes, and works in His people, viewed apart from responsibility?
C.A.C. Yes, it is connected with the counsel and wisdom of God, and it is possible for us to consider, What is God doing with me? Every believer is privileged to regard himself as a subject of the work of God, and it is a work which will result assuredly in that being brought to pass which is for the pleasure of God. I think it is very encouraging and comforting.
Ques. If God is working in that way, what should be our attitude towards it?
C.A.C. I think the effect of getting an intelligent apprehension of what God is doing with us would be that in our thoughts and our affections we should become more and
{371}
more identified with what the blessed God is doing, and that would be a great help.
Ques. Is that because we come under His instruction?
C.A.C. It is very suggestive that it says here, "His God doth instruct him in his judgment, he doth teach him". What we get here is something in which God would instruct and teach us so that we might understand the manner of God's working with us. What is He doing? It is a great reality, not merely a doctrine; there is no greater reality in the universe than the work of God in the souls of His people.
This scripture would show us how what is brought before us in the gospel of Luke can be realised; that is, that there shall be a hundredfold for God and for His people. It is in Luke that the Lord speaks of "an honest and good heart" -- we do not get that in Matthew or Mark -- and where that is, the result is a hundredfold for God and His people, because what is secured for God is secured also for His people to be their satisfaction and joy. The fruit of sowing in the land was that there were first-fruits and tithes for God, but also abundance for the food of His people. Whatever is secured in me for God, is also secured for the brethren; I think it is good to see that. We see here how the "honest and good heart" is produced; there is the work of the ploughman and the one who can open and break the clods of his land. The first element in the work of God is that there is a process carried on which brings to nothing all self-confidence. We may learn the force of this from @Jeremiah 4: 3, 4. "Break up for you a fallow ground, and sow not among thorns. Circumcise yourselves for Jehovah, and take away the foreskins of your heart". And then again in @Hosea 10: 11, 12 we read, "Judah shall plough, Jacob shall break his clods ... ; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek Jehovah, till he come and rain righteousness upon you". If the ground is fallow it is not prepared for the seed. A breaking up and breaking down process is necessary, so that all confidence in the flesh is removed, a truly contrite and humble spirit is produced, and there is a turning to God -- a seeking Him as the alone Source
{372}
of blessing and good. There are no hard "clods" left unbroken that would impede the reception of the seed, or fail to respond to it. A fine tilth is produced that offers no obstruction to the seed, but which favours a growth in the heart. The work of God is deep according to what is in His mind to bring about. When God began to work with us He had a certain end in view; He had a place for us in His kingdom and He took us in hand that we might be qualified to fill that place for His pleasure and the joy of His people. The breaking up of the fallow ground is very necessary, so that there may be a condition produced in the soul that is prepared for the reception of apprehensions of Christ. What God intends to do is to introduce into our hearts -- for this is a heart question, not doctrine -- apprehensions of Christ that are going to characterise us in His kingdom.
Ques. You were speaking about Luke's presentation of this; is it because the word of God is sown that results are produced?
C.A.C. Quite so. The word of God brings to us certain apprehensions of Christ; but in view of that, there must be the work of the ploughman, and all clods broken up; that is the work of God. He works that no self-confidence, or self-righteousness, or self-importance of any kind may be left.
The clods are broken up so that there may be nothing left unjudged that would resist what God is going to bring in. He is going to bring in fruitful apprehensions of Christ, and He first of all breaks up what would obstruct the reception and the growth of what he is going to bring in.
Ques. Would there be a breaking up of clods in 1 Corinthians?
C.A.C. Yes; a lot of hard clods remained that were not suitable to receive what God was bringing in, and it is often so practically with us, but it is at all times a first essential that fallow ground should be broken up, and hard clods pulverised that there may be receptiveness for what is of God in Christ. God is bringing in all that is of Himself set forth in Christ, and He works with us in view of that becoming fruitful
{373}
in us. There are many exercises before the soul is brought into that broken state-what Scripture speaks of as a "broken and contrite heart". Probably it is a state which has only partially been brought about, as yet, with some of us, but it is necessary if there is to be a fine tilth which is ready for the seed. It is the first element in the work of God. We can, at any rate, take account of the fact that God has wrought with us to reduce us, to break up our fallow ground. He would set aside in our estimation all that is of the flesh, that we might judge it in its true worthlessness. But He does this in order that He may bring in apprehensions of a Person in whom is His delight, and bring them in so that we may take character from the apprehensions of Christ that He gives us.
Ques. Do the different kinds of seed mentioned here set forth the impressions you are speaking of?
C.A.C. It is interesting that we get here the thought of variety in the seed. In the gospels there is no variety, we are not even told what kind of seed it was. But in this scripture there is variety, and each kind of seed is sown in its own place. There is no broadcast scattering on the wayside, the thorny ground, the stony ground, and so on; there is a prepared place for every different kind of seed.
I would encourage every young believer to think of himself or herself like that. God has taken me up and has put me through humbling exercises that answer to the ploughing and breaking of the clods, but in doing so His intention was to give me apprehensions of Christ that should mark me in His kingdom. God is not putting exactly the same impression of Christ on every one; there is variety.
Ques. Do you think the work of God is suggested in John l, where you have different apprehensions of Christ?
C.A.C. That is a most interesting scripture because you see there what might be represented by the different kinds of seed, there is variety of apprehensions of Christ. The two disciples got an impression of Him as the Lamb of God; then what was presented to Peter was the Messiah, which being interpreted is the Christ. Philip finds Him as the One who
{374}
had been the subject of all prophetic testimony, and then He is known to Nathanael as Son of God and King of Israel.
They all had different apprehensions, and I have no doubt that those apprehensions characterised those men in the kingdom of God; they became fruitful for the pleasure of God and also for the good of the brethren. It has comforted me to think that God has brought certain apprehensions of Christ before me which were exactly fitted to qualify me for the place in the kingdom which He has assigned me. I think it would do us good to get away from the side of imperfection, to think of the blessedness of what has been brought to us by God in His grace. He has given to each of us a distinctive apprehension of Christ; that has been brought about with us all.
Rem. Whether dill or cummin or wheat or barley, the seed is fruitful.
C.A.C. Yes, it seems to suggest variety, and each is put in its appointed place, so that the very place where we were born, and where we came under divine influences, and the very character of the ministry of Christ that we came into contact with was ordered of God. We need not think that if we had been somewhere else things would have been better. It has been ordered of God that certain impressions of Christ have been brought to us in the seed of the word so that they might become fruitful in us. Many different apprehensions of Christ are necessary to compass the whole truth. He is too great for any individual to compass; He is great enough for the whole assembly, and, if one may so say, God distributes apprehensions of Christ amongst all saints so that each one has his particular feature. This is illustrated in the twelve apostles. They had not all the same apprehension of Christ; and this is set forth by their names being on twelve different precious stones. The names of the twelve apostles are on the foundations of the heavenly city; they will be known there, but each one has his own distinctive glory. John's name is not on the same stone as Peter's; all the names are on different stones, and each will reflect or radiate the light of the impression
{375}
of Christ which they have. Such variety as that goes to make up the testimony today. The saints are the subject of divine grace and work, and God is giving to each just the apprehension of Christ that He intends. It has often been said that every gift is an expression of Christ. It is what a brother or sister knows of Christ that indicates what has been allotted to him or her. We see in Romans different activities amongst the saints as one body in Christ, and the same thing appears in Corinthians; there is the thought of distribution in a sovereign way according to God's will and pleasure.
Ques. How do we reach these things?
C.A.C. The point is that they reach us; it is what God has brought about. An impression of Christ is brought by the word of God into honest and good hearts, and that is so with every one who is a subject of the work of God. On the responsible side we must admit perhaps much weakness and failure, but there is a view of things according to which we can see that the wisdom and working of God has appeared in the whole of our spiritual history; the very place where we were born and brought up, the influence we came under, the setting of our spiritual lives has all been ordered in the wisdom of God, so that certain apprehensions of Christ have come into our hearts. It is a comfort to know that this has not happened in a casual or accidental way; it has come about in the wisdom of divine working; the more we get that into our souls the better.
Ques. Is there a way in which we can further the work of God or hinder it?
C.A.C. I think God would have us identified in thought and affection with His work, and it was in my mind in suggesting this subject that we might be thoroughly interested in the work of God, and that we might identify ourselves with it.
Ques. Is abundance of bread corn the end?
C.A.C. Yes, that is the end in view. We pass over from the sowing to the threshing, which I understand to represent the disciplinary ways of God with His saints. His reducing
{376}
ways come first; the ploughman's work, and breaking up the clods, then we get the enriching part of His ways, the bringing of seed in variety. Impressions of Christ in great variety are brought into the hearts of the saints by the work of God.
Lastly, the disciplinary ways of God are set forth in the threshing; each one is dealt with in divine wisdom, so that I have just the discipline that I need, and you have just the discipline that you need. It is divinely appointed. As under God's hand there is nothing to repine about or murmur over, and nothing for us to wish otherwise.
Rem. The reducing process brings us to the knowledge of God and discipline follows on that; we recognise the hand of God, the hand of the One we know and have learned in the reducing process. It says, "His God doth instruct him".
C.A.C. God has brought into our affections what has great value; what is of Christ has value, and we have to come to it that nothing else has. What I am naturally, socially or intellectually has no value; the only thing about me that has spiritual value is that which God has brought into my heart which is of Himself in Christ. When we see that we begin to appreciate the disciplinary ways of God of which we are all the subjects. Some have discipline in their health, some in their circumstances, or in their families, and some in connection with the trials and difficulties of the path of faith, or perhaps a combination of all. We are all under discipline, and one object of it is to teach us how to separate between what God has brought in and what is natural to us. The threshing is not for punishment, but to secure a pure result.
God is working to secure a pure result of His own operations, that what he has brought in in His grace shall -- be separated from what is natural, so that we become characterised by the fruit of grace and not by natural features. Even after we have received impressions of Christ into our hearts there is still a great deal left that belongs to the natural order, and the discipline of God is always to get the two things into their right places, and to bring about that there shall be a pure result for the garner of God, and also for the comfort of the saints.
{377}
Ques. It is encouraging to get our eye sometimes off the responsible side?
C.A.C. Yes, then we have God before us and what He is doing. That is very important because there are many influences that tend to turn us aside from that. It is right to consider the responsible side, and to allow the full weight of the parables in the gospels about the different kinds of ground; but when we get to the honest and good heart we have got to the divine side; that is, to the side of what is the product of a work of God. Then the seed is wholly of God, it is His word, and the particular character of the impression of Christ which is put in each heart is of God. It is of God that you should have your impression, and that I should have mine. Now it has to be worked out for the pleasure of God and for the satisfaction of His people.
Ques. Are the responsible side and the divine side indicated in @Philippians 2: 12, 13; "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you both the willing and the working according to his good pleasure"?
C.A.C. The two things in a certain way coalesce; all the fruit of grace in responsibility will ultimately coalesce with the fruit of divine working according to purpose, so that they come together.
Ques. Does the different treatment for each kind of seed here correspond with God's different disciplinary ways with us?
C.A.C. What is important is that we should recognise the wisdom and perfection of God's ways with each one of us; we are apt to question the ways of God with us, but we should remember that He is dealing with us in the proper way to secure the purity of the result. You may say, You do not know what my discipline is! But God knows, and He will not send the horses or the cart-wheel over the dill or the cummin; they are dealt with by the staff and the rod; they would not bear the cart-wheel, they would be crushed; there is divine wisdom in the application of discipline to each one of us. Whatever I have that is a trial to me, it is good to
{378}
recognise that it is just the appointed thing for me, and it is exactly suited to free the work of God from natural elements, so that there may be a pure result for God and for the happiness of His people.
Ques. Does @John 9 illustrate this?
C.A.C. Exactly; the man got impressions of Christ, and he thoroughly identified himself with those impressions. He says, "I was blind" -- I have finished with that now -- "now I see". He so identified himself with the work of God that was manifested in him that the Pharisees and the synagogue, and the whole surroundings in which he had been, all lost their power. No doubt he got his discipline; it meant something for a Jew to be put out of the synagogue; it was the cutting off of everything that had constituted his religious life; but even such a discipline as that only freed him from hindrance, and left him free to worship the Son of God in the outside place. That is how discipline works.
Bread corn is treated most severely; the cart-wheel and the horses go over that. Paul was a man over whom the cartwheel went. I do not suppose any man ever had a more severe and prolonged life of discipline than Paul. He could say, "Death works in us, but life in you". What a result for the saints! Not only did Paul benefit, but the saints benefited too. I have said sometimes to people under severe discipline, 'What are you praying about?' In most cases they say, 'I am praying that I may get the good out of this that the Lord intends'. I have sometimes suggested that they would do well to pray that *the saints* might get the good that the Lord intended by their discipline. Do you not think that would be good? One form of discipline that may come upon the saints is that they may lose a brother of great value and spiritual help; he is taken away. What for? You may depend upon it, it is part of the threshing process; we may get to lean on a brother in such a way that it may be the greatest spiritual gain to lose him. It may expose a weak point, but the discipline will result in our being strengthened at that weak point; whatever the discipline is it is divinely appointed, the rod and
{379}
the staff and the cart-wheel and the horses are all appointed as being the very best means that divine wisdom could devise to attain its own end.
Ques. Did not the discipline Paul went through, especially as a prisoner, yield gain for the saints?
C.A.C. Quite so; what a lot of bread corn there was!
There is not only sinful flesh, but a whole system of things connected with what we are naturally, which is not spiritual, and which will not do for the kingdom of God. That kingdom is a spiritual sphere, and the threshing is to eliminate those elements which will not do for the spiritual sphere. The result is that bread corn becomes available as fruit for God and for the nourishment of the saints.
Ques. Will God see to it that the saint gets the good of the discipline through which he is passed?
C.A.C. The ways of God in wisdom work inevitably that way. It may not appear as if all saints got the good of their discipline, but we cannot always judge as to this. If there is really a small result for God it indicates that one has a small place in His kingdom. We are disciplined as part of that which is of value to God; and whatever discipline comes upon us has in view the gain and the advancement of what is of God. I believe God would have each of us to take courage. One might say, I feel I have a very small impression of Christ. Well, cherish it; it is the work of God; you would not have it at all but for the work of God. Pray for its increase and maturing. To those under discipline I would say, Do not be discouraged; it is the dealing of God; it is to bring out more definitely and without mixture what is of God in your heart.
{380}
GOD'S LOVE LEADING TO PRAISE
@Isaiah 38: 17 - 20
In the dealings of God with Hezekiah, God brought the weight of death on his spirit, but it was really that he might learn how God could intervene in the power of resurrection, so that he might go up on the third day to the house of Jehovah. Before going up, however, there must be the application of the "cake of figs". It is clear from Scripture that the characteristic of the fig is sweetness -- see @Judges 9: 11. So that the "cake of figs" would be a symbol of the sweetness of divine intervention where all was apparently hopeless. Hezekiah wrote after he had recovered, "But thou hast in love delivered my soul from the pit of destruction", and, "Jehovah was purposed to save me" (@Isaiah 38: 17, 20). He learned the love of God at the low point to which he was brought.
It is terrible to us naturally to realise that death is upon us as before God, but it is just there that the love of God is brought home to us. "For we being still without strength, in the due time Christ has died for the ungodly. For scarcely for the just man will one die, for perhaps for the good man some one might also dare to die; but God commends his love to us, in that, we being still sinners, Christ has died for us" (@Romans 5: 6 - 8). The thought prominent in this scripture is not that the claims of God have been met -- that aspect of the truth is seen in the blood as put upon the mercy-seat -- but here it is that God's love has been expressed in Christ having died for us, and this love is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us. The love of God is thus applied to us as the cake of figs was applied to Hezekiah. How wonderfully sweet it is to find that Christ has been into death to give expression to the love of God, and this is made a personal reality to each one who has the Spirit.
{381}
Those who live by the Spirit in relation to God, as having God's love shed abroad in their hearts by the Spirit, know that it is in death that that love has reached them. "Death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: ... but death reigned from Adam until Moses"; "Death reigned by the one"; "Sin has reigned in the power of death" (@Romans 5: 12, 14, 17, 21). It is as the full weight of this comes on our spirits, we are prepared to appreciate that this dreadful thing -- death -- has become in the death of Christ the expression to us of the love of God. The Holy Spirit delights to apply that love to us by shedding it abroad in our hearts. The death of Christ thus becomes to us peculiarly full of sweetness. It is not simply that we believe that God loves us, but the Spirit pours His love into our hearts, and it becomes a power of life there. We are then amongst "the living", who can praise God for His love, known through the death of Christ. The assembly is made up of such living persons. Normally, one who has the Spirit is occupied with God and with Christ and with the death of Christ. Of course, if we grieve the Spirit by some allowance of the flesh, we may be as unhappy as if we had not the Spirit at all.
There is something more. "On the third day thou shalt go up to the house of Jehovah" (@2 Kings 20: 5). That implies the power of resurrection. The sign of it was that Jehovah "brought the shadow back on the degrees by which it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward" (@2 Kings 20: 11). God alone could reverse the whole natural course of things. This was the wonder which was done in the land. The fact that the shadow went backward ten degrees intimates that death is removed in the power of resurrection in a way that is known to faith, before the time when death will be publicly swallowed up in victory. While we are still here in the responsible life, where death is still manifestly upon all men, and, as to what is seen publicly, upon us too, we may know the power of Christ's resurrection, and we may be risen with Him by the faith of the working of God who
{382}
raised Him from among the dead. Going up on the third day implies the truth that is brought out in the epistle to the Colossians. Every one of us should apprehend this as a divine possibility.
Going up to the house of Jehovah would be for us entering into the privileges of the assembly. The youngest should understand that we come together in assembly first of all to think of the great witness of divine love in the death of Christ. Then it is our privilege to magnify Christ in every aspect of His person and glory, and in all that He is to the assembly as her glorious Head. Even the youngest and feeblest believer can say 'Amen' to every utterance which praises and magnifies Christ. This would prepare us in a very blessed way to "go up" into conscious association with Him as risen with Him, and to know that even as ascended to the Father, He owns us as His brethren. It is well to ask ourselves whether all this is known to us as a spiritual reality.
How could any lover of Christ keep away from the assembly if he realised that such precious things could be known there and enjoyed experimentally? It is sorrowful to think that any believer could willingly remain away from the Lord's supper, for it is the Lord's own personal appeal of love, intended to rally all His own. He would not have us to think that His supper is everything; He would have us to know something of what the "third day" speaks of and of going up. "And we will play upon my stringed instruments all the days of our life, in the house of Jehovah" (@Isaiah 38: 20). As we "go up" in association with Christ as His brethren, there is an answer to God's great thought, and He is praised in the same way that Christ praises Him as having come up out of death (see @Psalm 22: 22). "Stringed instruments" suggests that a great variety of notes can be sounded and that spiritual skill is evidenced by those who play upon them.
The musical services that are carried on in the christian profession are an imitation in a material way of the true spiritual service. They do not require spiritual skill, for those
{383}
who do not know God can take part in them. But those who have come up out of death by divine quickening can praise with Christ. He is the chief Musician, for as having glorified God in death and sin-bearing He can utter in resurrection every note of praise that is due to God. The praises of the assembly take character from the praises of Christ, for He hymns God in the midst of the assembly, and who would think of raising a discordant note? If we have known the pressure of death, and how divine love has reached us there, it is in view of our being free to "go up" in company with Christ to praise God whom he has made known to us in such a wondrous way.

READINGS ON HOSEA
{386}
{387}
NOTES OF A READING
@Hosea 1: 1 - 11
C.A.C. The prophet's name means 'Deliverance', which is a help to the understanding of the book, deliverance having a bearing on a very unfaithful state; and we are in a day when the affections of God's people are very corrupted and turned away to other objects. We should desire deliverance from everything that would hinder our affections being wholly for the Lord and for God; that is, to have affections that are suitable to the relationships God has brought about.
Ques. Were you referring to the relationships of "wife" and "sons"?
C.A.C. Yes, the marital relationship with Christ and the family relationship as sons; and we get them both in this chapter. The marriage relationship is of the most intimate character. It ought to touch us profoundly, the thought of the intimacy that divine Persons would have with us. All that is true for Israel is true for the church, and we want to read it for ourselves. We should be in the fervent affections of these relations that have been established, though we had nothing to do with the establishment of them. If God is love, He can only be satisfied by love.
Rem. Judgment came first to Israel.
C.A.C. It came earlier for Israel. It never did come for Judah till they rejected Christ. He carried on His dealings with them until Christ came, "of whom Christ came", it says.
Ques. To what does verse 7 refer?
C.A.C. It refers to what Jehovah did when Christ was on earth, by way of delivering power; it was all there for them in Jesus. Their condition is a whoredom of affection, which is set forth symbolically in the associations of the prophet. In
{388}
christendom the relations are departed from, not in doctrine, but in affection. There is very little idea of the relations as married to Christ and as sons to God, and it comes home to each of us as to whether we are wanting in the devoted affection which is proper to the relationships in which we are set.
Ques. What would help us in it?
C.A.C. I think it would help us to consider the relationship which was manifested in absolute perfection in Christ Himself. John speaks of Him as "the bridegroom", and the affections of the relationship are seen in integrity and fulness and fervency in Him. None of us would think of asking the Lord to love us more than He does! It is in considering the incorruptible affections of the Bridegroom that we are helped.
Ques. What would the 'sowing' (Jizreel) refer to?
C.A.C. Failure in affection always precedes failure in walk. A certain retributive sowing follows, for God never passes over unfaithful affections. Then there is a sowing that has in view all the purposes of God's love. We need to be balanced in the two thoughts. If we accept the first and humble ourselves, He falls back on His purposes and works them out in His own sovereignty and love from His own side, which is a great comfort. The whole constituted relationship was gone -- inwardly in affection. We have to search our hearts as to whether the incorruptible affections are there in fervency, so as to satisfy the heart of Christ.
"Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea". "Great is the day of Jizreel" in the aspect of the purpose of God. There are two views altogether different in his chapter. All saints are going to be in the blessedness of the marriage relationship, also in the relationship of sons.
The departure in affection is far more serious than the departure in doctrine, because it is inward and connected with the state of the saints. An extreme point is reached when Jehovah will not show mercy upon them, or say they
{389}
are His people, or be for them. These exercises are illustrated in a striking way in the prophets themselves, so that those paying attention could not very well miss what God was saying. Laodicea answers in the church period to what we get here.
Rem. The failure appears in the remnant itself.
C.A.C. The overcomer is only such in sovereign love and mercy, and each one would own that to be so.
Rem. It shall come to pass in *that place*, it says. Affections are begotten in them there, in that condition of things.
C.A.C. In the very place where it was said, "Not my people", there it shall be said, "Sons of the living God" it says (verse 10). It extends to those who get blessing among the Gentiles; it comes down to us this afternoon.
We cannot revive our own affections. I suppose there is none of us but has had the experience of being cold and dead towards the Lord and being wholly unable to revive our affection to the Lord. I am sorry for the person that has not had a touch of it. Nothing has caused me more anguish than the knowledge that I was unresponsive to the love of Christ after all He had done and is, and that I had not the least bit of power to make myself so. Now that casts us on God; it needs a divine Person to come in for us, and it is a much more intense exercise than that of @Romans 7. In Romans you cannot do what you would like to, but now it is a person who has known deliverance from the law, exercised to be wholly responsive to the love of Christ and of God, and he finds there is not the power in him. What is he to do? He is just as much cast upon God for that as the other. God would have us take up these relationships in real and fervent affection, so that they satisfy God, so that they satisfy divine Persons. This is what God has before Him and this will be so in eternity. @Romans 8 unfolds how it is done. If God does not give His Spirit in my heart I am as helpless as a block of wood.
Rem. We cannot work up a state.
C.A.C. Well, let anybody try it! This shows how the divine deliverance supplies everything necessary, so that
{390}
divine Persons may have Their satisfaction in us. It is most encouraging.
Rem. As we get a little further on in Romans, "For of him, and through him, and for him, are all things" (@Romans 11: 36).
C.A.C. Yes.
NOTES OF A READING
@Hosea 2: 16 - 23; @Hosea 3: 1 - 5
C.A.C. The turning-point with Israel, as with all of us, is the recognition that our relation with divine Persons is one of affection. "In that day, saith Jehovah, ... thou shalt call me, My husband". In a coming day they will claim Him in that relation of affection. He has had to wait more than two thousand years for it, but He will not be content till He gets it. Jehovah became Man in order to meet the need of man, but all had in view this relation of affection. Then His being claimed in this relation, the rivals all lose their power, they all disappear. "They shall no more be remembered by their name". And the Lord is not going to be content until that is so with each one of us. And it is so with every family. We have been singing, 'Reign without a rival there'. So we should be altogether for Him, because He has been altogether for us -- is not that the basis? It applies to the local assembly. The local assembly in Corinth had been espoused to Christ. The apostle says, "I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ".
If we are consistent with the relation in affection, He will see to it that we are preserved from every hostile power. They were not so at Corinth, and the apostle says, "But I fear". It is written there to act upon us all, if we hold the position. It is most affecting; it is Jehovah saying, I cannot bear not to have your whole-hearted affection. He cannot
{391}
bear to have what is half-hearted or lukewarm, it is nauseous to Him. He cannot bear it. Love has gone to such lengths that it has established a righteous claim to our whole-hearted love. If we are not rendering it, we are not righteous.
In the previous section His dealings in love are to bring us to recognise the relationship of love, and say, "My husband". Righteousness, judgment, loving-kindness, and faithfulness, these are features of the husband that come out in the betrothed company. They correspond with the features that marked Jehovah Himself; and there must be correspondence in them, or how could He enter into the marriage relationship? The prophetic word is to make us like Him down here, it is not to make us fit for heaven. It is for earth, not for heaven. "The heavens ... shall hear the earth". It all goes up from the bottom. There will be no prophecy in heaven, so we had better make the most of the meetings for prophetic ministry, because we are not going to have many of them!
Rem. "As he is, we also are in this world" is true of us.
C.A.C. Yes, it is true of us abstractly; but when it comes to the practical side, it is, "We know that if it is manifested we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. And every one that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as *he* is pure" (@1 John 3: 2, 3) -- that is, down here. It is suitability brought about down here that corresponds with Him in the bond of love, with the sense of the resource there is in Him and of no need to turn anywhere else. Suitability is brought about through the care of the Husband.
"And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith Jehovah, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth; and the earth shall hear the corn, and the new wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jizreel". There will be freedom of communication between the top and the bottom -- an unbroken chain from the top to the bottom. That is, there is that at the bottom that corresponds with the top. Think of a few saints down here in T. morally corresponding with Christ at the top! For it to be brought about down here is a greater triumph for God and for Christ than having the saints in
{392}
glory. It is the result of having a personal link with Christ. So God gets it now, and in a better way in the saints of the assembly, as He will do in the remnant in the tribulation, because it is in conditions of contrariety and testing. It is all, I am convinced of it, that the assembly may be morally ready for presentation.
Ques. What is meant by the purchase in chapter 3?
C.A.C. In the prophets God has employed some very striking figures, and this is one. It shows how on the ground of purchase Jehovah secures His right, and the Lord does that with us all. It showed how, in spite of the depraved affections of Israel, Jehovah was unchanged in affection on His side.
Ques. What is the difference between redemption and purchase?
C.A.C. Redemption is, you once had something and you lost it, and you get it back. Purchase is, you never did have it, but you acquire a right by purchase.
Ques. Were not the Israelites redeemed?
C.A.C. The position here is on the ground of purchase, which is equally tenable by the Gentile -- Paul quotes this passage in Romans as establishing that principle. It is the whole relation of a purchased people. "Ye are bought with a price". We have to see to it that what has been purchased shall be delivered. "Barley" is only used in the jealousy offering (@Numbers 5: 15). It is an intimation of their unfaithfulness, so the jealousy offering has to come in. So it is a question for all of us whether we are abiding for Christ. We are to see to it that we do, and He will abide for us. "Thou shalt abide for me many days ... and I will also be for thee", and that is as true today as when the prophet wrote it.
He has found the purchase price, and the ransom price, and the redemption price. When they realise it, they turn to Him (verse 5). It is made easy for us. It is no legal claim. We have to own the claim of love. If I do not, I am a dishonest person. You cannot get out of it.
{393}
Ques. Why is it, "Jehovah their God, and David their king"?
C.A.C. Jehovah and His Christ are combined in one Person in our Lord Jesus Christ. And it is all looked at in relation to the departure. Then God in sovereignty works and brings them to accept the relationship, and as soon as they do, He undertakes everything for them. He says, "I will also be for thee".
NOTES OF A READING
@Hosea 5: 15; @Hosea 6: 1 - 7
C.A.C. We were saying last week we see figuratively in chapter 3 that Jehovah establishes a claim by purchase upon His idolatrous people. In spite of their unfaithfulness His claim is established by purchase, though He may have to wait many days. And this is true in our case. His title to Israel and His title to us is established by purchase. There may not be much affection on our side, but that does not alter Him.
The last prophecy given in Israel was that Jesus was about to die for that nation that they might not perish, that is, He has established His claim whatever might be on their side. "Ye are bought with a price", it says. It does not matter if there is any response or not, the Lord's title is established by purchase. As regards Israel it is at the end of the days. It is something like two thousand five hundred years since the prophecy was given.
Rem. They will be afflicted and afterwards return to Jehovah.
Ques. I was thinking of @Luke 15. Does it correspond with the return of sons in these closing days?
C.A.C. Yes, I was thinking that. The claim established by purchase must have a response. We cannot think of God
{394}
or of the Lord Jesus giving up the claim of love. There is no change on the Lord's side as to Israel, nor on the divine side as to the assembly. The change is needed on our side, and this book shows how this change is brought about -- has been, I trust with many of us -- and will be brought about in any whose hearts are moved under the dealings of God.
Ques. It says, "My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge" (@Hosea 4: 6). Is the question of knowledge important?
C.A.C. I should think it is most important, because the knowledge referred to is the knowledge of the first verse, really "the knowledge", that is, it is the specific knowledge. The controversy of God was because there was no knowledge of God in the land. And really everything turns on that; and it is the only thing that affords any satisfaction to God, that there should be the knowledge of Him. It puts everything right.
Ques. Does chapter 6: 3 refer to Jerusalem?
C.A.C. Well, that is in view, but we are thinking of it as applying to ourselves. "For I delight in loving-kindness, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings" (verse 6). It is what God delights in. Our thought is to do something for Him. "They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Jehovah; but they shall not find Him" (chapter 5: 6). He has withdrawn Himself from them; that is, we shall never find Him on that line. If we go with our flocks and herds, that is bringing something to God. God says, Now, that is not what I am after. I think chapter 6: 6 must be a very favourite scripture with the Lord. I do not know that there is any other scripture that He quoted twice. The Jew was always on the line of works; it is the danger with us too, and it ends up with the withering of the soul.
Ques. Is it not the difference between the old and new covenants? In @Hebrews 8 you get, "They shall not teach each his fellow-citizen, and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; because all shall know me in themselves, from the little one among them unto the great among them".
{395}
C.A.C. The great pleasure to God is that we should know Him. It is not what we bring -- that will be all right if we know Him. The Pharisees used the law in a legal way upon the tax-gatherers and sinners. But the latter sat at table with Jesus and His disciples. His presence altered the whole thing. It was not, What can I get? but, What can I bring to these tax-gatherers and sinners? It alters all on man's side. If God is known in goodness and loving-kindness, it brings about what is corresponding in His people.
Paul said to the Corinthians, Some of you are ignorant of God. They were saying there was no resurrection. It is a very primary matter that God should be known as the God of resurrection. If you do not know Him thus, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. So the greatest thing is the knowledge of God.
Rem. @John 17 says, "This is the eternal life, that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent".
C.A.C. So the reference here is to eternal life. And do you not think the whole of this book (one of the most instructive books there is) is for that purpose? It shows the knowledge of God is only reached through affliction. That is the purpose of His dealings; and behind all His dealings is the thought of His love. He means us to come into the truth of wifely relations, sonship and eternal life, and all that is bound up in His thoughts of love. All that is bound up in His dealings with us. What pains He took to produce in us conviction of sin. Millions of our fellow-beings live and die without any pangs of conviction. No child of God ever does.
Rem. It says twice that they "dealt treacherously" (chapter 5: 7 and 6: 7).
C.A.C. That was true of us all; we have been unfaithful to what God has made known, all the light He has given; and God deals with us to bring us to a sense of how unfaithful we have been. It is a breakdown in affections that is chiefly in view in this book -- that is where the assembly has broken down. But the Lord chastens and disciplines. "As many as
{396}
I love, I rebuke and chasten; be zealous therefore and repent" (@Revelation 3: 19). He disciplines and waits until there is an acknowledgment of their trespass (@Hosea 5: 15). He cannot do anything with us before. When there is acknowledgment, He says: I will undertake everything for you. It is afflicted persons that seek God. Is any other acceptable? "Is any ... afflicted, let him pray" (@James 5: 13). God is waiting for that, and we see His dealings are to bring us to the point that we must cease from all confidence in ourselves and turn to Him.
Then He will undertake everything for us. It runs through the whole life of the believer. Satan always tells us to keep quiet like the psalmist. He was shutting it up in his own breast and had no relief until, "I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity I covered not; I said, I will confess my transgressions unto Jehovah, and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin" (@Psalm 32: 5). Then God will do all that is necessary for those who accept His dealings and His smiting.
As it says, "He hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up. After two days will he revive us; on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live before his face". So we had better return to Him. There is the sense in the soul that God is for us. We have only to turn to Him in the truth of the conditions, whatever they may be, and He will do everything for us. And if we are not firmly fixed on that ground, we have not the knowledge of God. Fancy the blessed God making known to us what He is in His goodness! That is the importance of owning God in what has made me smart, because I learn Him. It is God that has made me smart, but that I might know Him. 'Oh, I do want you to know Me', He says. 'I have given you that stroke because I want you to know Me'. It is grand.
Ques. Why does it say, "like Adam" in verse 7?
C.A.C. It goes back to Adam, the very root, which was lack of confidence in God.
Ques. To what do the three days in chapter 6: 2 refer?
C.A.C. There are certain experiences to be gone
{397}
through preparatory to our getting the knowledge of God in Christ.
Ques. Would it cover the thought of death and burial?
C.A.C. No doubt. In the great general ways of God, which apply in miniature to the believer, the law came in first. It was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ. It brought the conviction of sin and powerlessness. It is the way all souls have to pass through to get blessing in Christ. It is @Romans 7 for us.
Then the day of the prophets deepened the lesson taught under the law, and brought in the promises of what God would do. But the prophets made certain that the blessing could only come in through Christ.
Ques. What is the third day, "On the third day he will raise us up"?
C.A.C. I think the third day was like Christ's day. "And we shall live before his face". The third day brings in Christ. Think what the disciples had in the Lord. They found the claims of the law were all there in perfect fulfilment in Him. As to the prophets, they were all there in a blessed Man in perfect fulfilment. And they came into the shining of Christ. All the goodness of God was there in Him, and is there in Him for us. That is what revives the soul.
Ques. Would you say a word as to His going forth as the morning dawn?
C.A.C. Is that not what we come to as following on? That is, it is first raising us up and making us live before His face; and then from that standpoint we follow on to know Jehovah, and His going forth is as assured as the morning dawn; His blessedness is as the eternal day.
It is very much like @John 20. He goes forth to lead really into the knowledge of His Father and His God, known as the Father and God of His brethren, all in view of association with Him in ascension. He comes out of death and goes into resurrection, and is going forth into all that blessedness. What an experience it must have been to the disciples to find
{398}
He was risen, and that He could be near to them as risen, and that was really on the ground that they were risen with Him.
It could not have been as natural men in the flesh. I do not mean that they entered into it, but He did. The knowledge of God enters into all that. If we do not know it, we are lacking in the knowledge of God. The third day He will raise us up, so we shall live before His face. It is a question whether we have taken in His great thought, which is absolutely true in His mind, that we are raised. Now I want you to know My thought of you, He would say.
The disciples in those forty days had a very blessed experience of what it is to be suitable to Him as His companions. It was not doctrine -- they did not know the doctrine -- but experience with them. And we are not ready for the assembly on its privilege side if we do not know it. He goes forth there to bring to pass all that before the world's foundation was in the divine mind and counsel. He goes out of death for us to go out of death along with Him, that we might be participators in His life.
Ques. What is "the latter rain"?
C.A.C. The latter rain is the Spirit. It is to bring the crop to maturity. We are in that now; the Spirit is working to bring to maturity the great thoughts of God and His love. We are in it now. The Spirit brings that to maturity in the saints, that is, the complete thought of God. It is the climax of the book, showing the thoughts of divine love in their fruition.
It involves Christ being glorified, His having gone forth to be glorified. And His going forth is assured as the morning dawn. It is that He might come to us Spirit-wise to refresh us.
What a lot we should have to pray about. It is @John 14, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you". He comes to minister comfort to us. In the Supper we should look first to be comforted in the great thoughts of divine love. That is before He leads us in praise, because He has got to qualify us, so to speak.
Rem. When He came to them in @John 20 He said, "Peace be to you".
{399}
C.A.C. There must be conditions of peace for Him to unfold the Father's great things. So He says, "Peace", that is the first thing. The first result is a great pervading sense of divine peace. We get too much occupied with our flocks and herds. But the Lord says, I shall tell you wonderful things if you will listen to Me. I shall furnish you with everything.
And so the headship of Christ comes in. "The head, from whom all the body ... increases with the increase of God"
(@Colossians 2: 19). So you get increase in the knowledge of God.
That is the first operation of the headship of Christ. So a brother will pray before the meeting, 'O, that I might be a vessel used for increase in the knowledge of God'. There will be no difficulty about the praise then.
Rem. "And this man shall be Peace", it says (@Micah 5: 5).
C.A.C. That is beautiful. That will be true in a coming day. Israel will know Christ as risen; that will qualify them to enter into eternal life on the earth. And there will be no armaments then, but peace.
This book is taken up by the Lord, by Paul and by Peter; so that we are not at all wrong in taking this up as applying to us now. Peter says that no prophecy of Scripture is had from its own particular interpretation. You cannot tie up to Israel what is said in the prophetic word, but it is true of the assembly.
"For I delight in loving-kindness, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings". It is as we are filled with loving-kindness as known in God that God has delight in us. He is not concerned about sacrifice, though that has its place. Well, God is wonderful and His ways are wonderful. And this book is largely the unfolding of His chastening ways, involving His smiting and wounding. It is like the outpouring of the grief of Christ over Jerusalem. It is the Spirit of Christ mourning over the condition of the people. Does it make us weep over the condition of the christian profession, or do we have hard thoughts about people? Do we feel ready to weep as feeling all they are missing and what God is missing?
{400}
NOTES OF A READING
@Hosea 12: 1 - 14
C.A.C. The reference to Jacob in this chapter is really remarkable as bringing out the great principles on which blessing is secured. I suppose they had been actually worked out in the history of Israel, especially of Jacob.
Last week we were referring to the faithfulness of God that remained unchanged in spite of all their unfaithfulness, the reason for it being, "For I am God, and not man". It is a great bulwark to the soul to think of what God is. God's reason for not giving up an unfaithful people is that God is God and not man. But there must be certain conditions brought about in the people, that are necessary, if they are to be in the good practically of the truth that God is their God. What comes out here is the sovereign work of God in the people of His election.
Ques. Why are there such quick changes in the names in this chapter? We get Ephraim, Judah, Jacob and then Israel.
C.A.C. It is important to notice the rapid transitions in this prophet, more perhaps than in any other. What helps us is to see the line of the Spirit of God, which is evidently to occupy us with Jacob, so that we might in the first place trace out the history of Jacob in our own souls. It is as if to say, 'I want you to go over the history of Jacob yourselves'.
In the presentation of Jacob there is energy found with him, so that the first thing said of him is that he took his brother by the heel in the womb. It is prophetic instruction for us. It was the action from which he derived his name. We should all covet to have that name. It was an intimation that the elder was to be displaced by the younger, and that is a precious exercise in the soul of every saint. The elder stands for what is natural. That which is spiritual does not come first, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual. We are all here with intense desire to supplant what
{401}
is of the flesh by what is of the Spirit. The point is there is intense energy with him.
Rem. It is an instinct with him to go in for the blessing.
C.A.C. At one time there was nothing present but the natural and fleshly. After God's election a new principle came in, in which what was younger had power to displace what was elder. In Jacob it was purely of God's election. It is nothing on our part, but God's sovereignty that leads us to do what we never should do naturally. So that in God's elect (Jacob is the great sample of God's elect) their naughty, crooked ways show they are no better than anyone else. So he is a good example. Thus energy to displace what is natural and carnal is what first works in a soul in which God works. So there is an energy to break away from all that is fleshy and natural.
Rem. He valued the inheritance.
C.A.C. That showed that he was God's elect. He had power to displace the elder, which developed into power with God. So it says, "In his strength he wrestled with God. Yea, he wrestled with the Angel, and prevailed; he wept, and made supplication unto him". "In his strength he wrestled with God". That is the second great element in the soul. Then there is positive power to prevail with God. This is just the converse of what we were looking at last week. He had to be reduced first, the hollow of his thigh touched. That is, the prominent thing in Genesis is that God wrestled *with him*. It says, "There wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day". Jacob was so vigorous and stubborn he would not give in, and so are we. That is what happens to all of us; we are reduced to a helpless clinging to Him. We read of agonising in prayer -- that is wrestling. We can read of it in the Scriptures, if we do not know much about it. It is what we read of Paul and Epaphras doing. He wrestled with God and prevailed. It is wonderful the remarkable strength in the man; he wrestled with God and secured what he wanted. And will any of us get on if we are not in earnest? This is not the gospel. There is no wrestling on the part of the sinner to
{402}
get blessing from God. We try to prevent him being on that line, do we not? This taking up wrestling with God is most important. I think this represents the exercise of God's elect.
Ques. The Angel was Jehovah?
C.A.C. The Angel was just Jehovah.
Ques. Would not such earnestness be agreeable to God?
C.A.C. Yes, very pleasing to God. God is very pleased with any person who is determined to get blessing from Him.
Rem. It says we are to take the kingdom by force.
C.A.C. The old saints used to speak of wrestling in prayer. We do not hear much of that now. Paul says "I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ" in @Ephesians 3: 14. There is an intensity of exercise we do not perhaps know much about.
Rem. It says of Christ that "being in conflict he prayed more intently, and his sweat became as great drops of blood".
C.A.C. You see it in the very highest effect in the Lord Himself -- the intensity of soul -- anguish.
What a rebuke this is to a people having gone away from God! Your energy and wrestling, where are they? Look at your father. And people do not get anything by sitting still, and being fed with a spoon! There is a very great desire on the part of most of us for ministry, but we get things on our knees. When I have been asked sometimes whether I did not think we had had a good meeting, I have answered 'I do not know'. How did it *affect us*? is the question. Did we go to our chambers and kneel down and weep before Him to get it? It is the only way to get it.
Jacob was at Bethel. I suppose it means he found God there, the blessed God that the people cared nothing about, so that they preferred idolatry to Him. But there was a man they knew by name who sought Him with an intensity of exercise that would not turn aside. And he found Him in His house. That is where we find God. The great instruction for him was to learn that Bethel was the house of God and to find that God talked to him. He "went up from him in the
{403}
place where he had talked with him", it says. That is, in the house of God there are personal communications from God. Well, that is a much greater reality today, I was going to say, than in Israel's day. It is God made known in His house, in all the blessed revelation of what He is as made known in His Son. We know it to be a reality; we know He has talked to us. God has always contemplated from the beginning having a great multitude. Enoch speaks of "his holy myriads". All the wonderful things God has before Him He would talk to us about, and particularly as gathered together in the assembly. All this has its point because the people have got altogether astray from it, and Jehovah is recalling an idolatrous and unfaithful people to what was from the beginning.
Ques. "Jehovah is his memorial", what does that mean?
C.A.C. Is it not all that in which God delights to be known?
Rem. We think of it usually as something to be remembered or appreciated.
C.A.C. Its use in Scripture is not the usual meaning of the word. It is what sets forth the blessed revelation of God. "This is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations" (@Exodus 3: 15).
Ques. Has it a present bearing?
C.A.C. I thought so. What a memorial the Lord has here as having brought Himself into the hearts of His people! Then there is the other side of the exercise brought out in Jacob serving. "Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep".
Ques. Why the change from Jacob to Israel?
C.A.C. His dignified name is used when it is a question of serving for a wife. I think God has pictured in Jacob the whole course of His love to the children of Israel. In the principle of it we can bring it over into the assembly. It shows that God could only secure what He wanted in Israel on the line of serving. I think God had been serving Israel through the prophets all through their history and He had been serving them as sheep, so that they could come into the place of
{404}
wife. The whole controversy was that God had been looking for wifely relations with His people, but they had been unfaithful. It has been carried out mediately through the prophets, as the service of the Lord is carried out by His servants mediately.
Ques. Will you explain what you mean?
C.A.C. Well, just as the service of Christ is carried out by means of vessels; that is, His great service to the assembly was carried out in the first place by the apostles. He did serve clearly, He is Head, but He carried it out by the apostles and gifts.
Jehovah had been serving them from Moses to Malachi, all through, with the desire to establish their wifely relationship with Himself. He is bringing them back to His own thoughts; it is the only thing to do in a day of departure. And that is the only thing to do now.
Think of the wonderful service that Christ has been rendering to the assembly for two thousand years! In @Ephesians 4 we are told how the ascended Christ has been given gifts. The service of Christ is carried on by that means (cf. @Ephesians 5: 26). And viewed as sheep we are always the subjects of service. Sheep are never required to do anything but feed, are they? So @John 10 is a wonderful chapter as showing the precious service of Christ as Shepherd of the sheep.
Rem. It says of Jacob's service for Rachel that the years seemed as single days for the love that he bore her.
C.A.C. Yes, that is just an expression of Jehovah's love to Israel and it is just an expression of Christ's love to the assembly. I believe the Lord is serving us now in love, but He wants a wife. In a certain sense He is not satisfied with sheep, He wants a wife. Sheep cannot enter into His thoughts.
Rem. "I am the good shepherd; and I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine, as the Father knows me and I know the Father" (@John 10: 14, 15).
C.A.C. It is the knowledge of a kindred nature. Does that not underlie the thought of the wife? If we do not know
{405}
the sheep relation, we shall not know the wife relation. At the present time the church has miserably failed to occupy the position of wife.
It is a wonderful picture here. First the exercise of supplanting the elder, then energy to seek God with intensity of exercise. When J.B.S. was once asked a question, he answered, 'Did you ever spend a night in prayer about it?' That pulls us up. When we think of how wonderful it is to know Him, are we content to show that we never have the energy to seek Him? Then we are qualified to enter into this thought of service, which has in view the securing of the wife. That is, all the service Christ is rendering now has in view the thought of a wife. How there are the great principles of blessing. There is remarkable instruction in it. It is the line that leads to the knowledge of God and the securing of a wife. It must all proceed on this line. It is good for us if we take it in.
NOTES OF A READING
@Hosea 14: 1 - 9
C.A.C. It is very touching to see what Jehovah says of Israel in chapter 13: 4, 5: "Yet I am Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou hast known no God but me; and there is no saviour besides me. I knew thee in the wilderness, in the land of drought". It showed there was no change in the relations of Jehovah. There was the most terrible departure and unfaithfulness on the side of the people, but on His side He was still Jehovah their God, and there was no other. So it was still possible for them to return to Him, and if they did so, they would find He was just what He ever had been. And in principle we all rejoice to know that is as true for us as for them. All that was made known of God at the beginning of our dispensation still remains true, and however far His
{406}
people have departed from it, it is there to return to, if any one of them is minded to do so. It is a very great comfort, is it not?
Rem. We have the revelation of the Father by the Son at the beginning.
C.A.C. At the beginning the Father was revealed in the Son, and the Holy Spirit was given to those who believed.
Redemption was wrought in divine love through the death and blood-shedding of Christ, so that through what He accomplished saints should have a wholly new place before God in Christ. And all that was true then is true now. Christendom has departed from it, but it is there to be returned to by any with the mind to do so. It says, "O Israel, return unto Jehovah". Well, that is just as true for us as them. We have moved away, I mean as part of the christian profession, but God has not. If we return to God, we must return to what is in His heart and mind, from which He has never departed.
Rem. He put the very words in their mouth. He says, "Take with you words". He tells them what to do and how to do it.
C.A.C. It is because the blessed God is so anxious that we should return to the full blessedness of what He is Himself as revealed in love. We have only to read @Romans 5 and 8 to see what saints enjoyed at the beginning, and if we return we shall enjoy it too, not to speak of resurrection with Christ and being seated in the heavenlies in Him -- all things that were true at the beginning of the dispensation. The iniquity of the dispensation is that these things have been departed from.
Ques. What is the meaning of, "Repentance shall be hid from mine eyes", in chapter 13: 14?
C.A.C. Just what we have been saying; God intimates that He would ransom and redeem them. It is what He would do, it is all on His side. It is just as true for us. God here delivers with the full power of death in view. So that if we return to God, we return to all these things.
{407}
Ques. The power of Sheol is the limit, would you say?
C.A.C. And that is actually the state of man. It is not merely the state of being wicked sinners, but we are in death -- that is the truth. Jesus said to Martha, "Did I not say to thee, that if thou shouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?" (@John 11: 40), and the glory of God is to overthrow all the power of death. So the position that results is a wholly new one. We are not now patched upon the old, but it is a wholly new condition in Christ. And I suppose we never really return to God till we see that.
But He takes pains to put words into our mouths. If there is any desire to return to God, He makes it very simple for us. "Take with you words, and turn to Jehovah; say unto him, Forgive all iniquity, and receive us graciously" -- that is the whole matter.
Rem. It seems to me we come to it that we really prove God to be what we believe Him to be.
C.A.C. Yes. And He makes Himself known in His infinite grace, so that we become offerers. "So will we render the calves of our lips", it says; so that Hosea has clearly the thought of spiritual sacrifices. It is not a literal calf here, showing that the Old Testament gives the thought of spiritual sacrifices -- sacrifices that can be brought by what we say.
God has made it possible for us to bring sacrifices. As being forgiven and in liberty, we are free to bring sacrifices, as it is said, "The sacrifice of praise continually to God, that is, the fruit of the lips confessing his name" (@Hebrews 13: 15). The lips are important as giving expression to what is in the heart.
Rem. He goes back to the land of Egypt in chapter 13: 42.
C.A.C. Yes, I think we have to go back to God as revealed in Christ. There is no true recovery until we come to that. It is not just that I have been bad; recovery is that we are brought to the blessedness of God. He says, 'Return unto Me'. It is not that I have got right exactly, but God has received His right place in my heart and soul. The younger
{408}
son in @Luke 15 said, "I perish with hunger", but that was not the main thing, was it?, but that there springs up in his heart a sense of the blessedness to be found in the father's heart. Bereft of human counsel, he finds God gracious to him. It is like the father falling on the prodigal's neck and covering him with kisses. It is marvellous to think of. Well, it is the way God receives all that turn to Him. Then it is that evil things are turned away from. The mind of the man and his heart get strength, and the idolatry is renounced, the soul has finished with all that.
Rem. What has displaced God will be displaced. And it will be so in the universe by and by; God will be all in all, supreme.
Rem. God is more delighted with recovery than anything else. The very fall was allowed to take place that there might be recovery.
C.A.C. Yes, so that the knowledge of His glory might be brought in in such a tender and touching way. We know God by the very extremity of the need we are in. No angel of God can know God as we do. The elder son was outwardly near, but morally very far off.
Rem. Self-righteousness hinders us more than we think.
C.A.C. Yes, it is the great snare of the human heart. God loves to remove every trace of the former state. "I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely". There was no trace of the younger son's defection and departure when he came back into the father's house. "I will love them freely", there is no restraint on the love of God, He is set at liberty to love them freely. Well, if He loves the saints as He loves Christ, that is freely indeed. We do not take it in, but there it is. The world is yet to know "that thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me" (@John 17: 23). Well, that is the character of the love into which we are brought. And is it not the sense of these things that becomes the spring of everything that is good in the saints? So He says, "I will be as the dew unto Israel".
Ques. What is the dew?
{409}
C.A.C. It is a refreshing influence from above that causes things to spring up in life, is it not?
Rem. In @Psalm 133 it speaks of the dew descending and of "life for evermore". There are wonderful suggestions here of what there is for God -- the lily and the smell of Lebanon.
C.A.C. And that is brought about in the saints as coming under the influence of God, and all that God is and Christ is. So it says, "He shall blossom as the lily". It strikes me, if we read this prophet and see all he says of the state of this people, we could hardly have a greater contrast than this blossoming as a lily. I suppose the Jew is a byword for selfishness and greed. Well, he is going to blossom as the lily and be in the beauty of Christ. So the apostle Paul was before "a blasphemer and persecutor, and an insolent overbearing man", and he comes out in the meekness and gentleness of Christ. It is wonderful what the grace of God can effect, and we see it sometimes; cross-grained people become as meek and gentle as lambs.
Ques. Why does it say, "Cast forth his roots as Lebanon"?
C.A.C. It is what grows up here in moral beauty under the eye of God, and I suppose that really requires the roots being cast forth as Lebanon. That is, it suggests a firm grounding in all these precious things we have been speaking of, that the roots of the soul have laid hold of these things; so that the stability of the soul is likened to Lebanon. Lebanon is brought in three times in these verses. It suggests what is excellent, does it not? Moses asks to go over and see that goodly mountain and Lebanon, as if he looked upon Lebanon as the crowning feature of the land.
Rem. "Wine" rejoices the heart of God.
C.A.C. All these things are a test of wisdom. He challenges us in the last verse. All these figures are not used at random, they all have their significance. Then "his beauty shall be as the olive tree". That shows that saints are linked on with all the promises of God; the olive tree is connected with divine promise; Abraham is the olive tree of promise. So
{410}
that everything spiritual is developed in the soul as we draw from the olive tree of promise. The olive tree speaks of that, it is what yields the oil.
Ques. "They shall revive as corn", what does that mean?
C.A.C. I think it means the saints become sources of strength and stimulation, they actually become that.
Rem. Scripture speaks of wine that makes glad man's heart.
C.A.C. And the saints moving in the blessedness of all this become sources of great strength and stimulation; that is why we love the company of the saints, because we find strength in it and stimulation.
Ques. It says, "Sit under his shadow". To what does that refer?
C.A.C. That is very important, for we are in a place where we need to be shaded from the influences that are about. We all know that the corrupt influences of the scene we are passing through tend to influence and exhaust us, and make us spiritually dry, and we need shade, and we find it under His shadow.
Rem. "A man shall be ... as the shadow of a great rock in a thirsty land" (@Isaiah 32: 2).
C.A.C. The thought of shadow is very marked in Scripture, and it applies to a time when influences are against us; we need to be shaded from them. It is in the light of all this that Ephraim commits himself definitely and says, "What have I to do any more with idols?" He comes into the light of all this, and renounces the idols. There is a time in the history of the soul when we do so. God notices it. It is God who says, "I answer him, and I will observe him". It is like a little conversation; that is, if there is any movement to renounce what is idolatrous, He notices it. When we please God we know it. It is no vain boast when he says, "I am like a green fir-tree". He is conscious of his freshness as recovered to God. "From me is thy fruit found"; that is, all that is pleasing to God in the saints has its source in God. So that all vainglory has no place, and there is something better in its place. The whole
{411}
book of Hosea has to do with a people on earth, so if we do not come out in the verification of these things now, we shall never have the chance.
In the previous chapters everything is seen as departed, it is the exposure of their state. Now there is a return. And we are to observe these things, and as observing them and as being wise, we shall understand the ways of divine love with His people.

READINGS ON JOEL
{414}
{415}
NOTES OF A READING
@Joel 1: 1 - 4, 9, 10; @Joel 2: 12 - 14, 25 - 32
C.A.C. Great principles are often developed in Scripture for the instruction of the people of God, and they are to be handed down, "Tell your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation", and they are particularly valuable in times of famine. It is pretty much the condition of christendom today; the oblation is cut off. "The oblation and the drink-offering are cut off from the house of Jehovah".
Rem. Joel was written at the time of the defection of Manasseh. There are many things today to distress. We see famine on all hands -- great lack of what is spiritual.
Rem. There is to be a line of faithful men carried on.
C.A.C. That is just what is developed here. You find that persons you meet have not much sense of what it is to be in Christ Jesus. The christian profession is withered up. It is partly the judgment of God, because it has departed from Paul; the enemy has made inroads, and God has purposed he should. "The priests, Jehovah's ministers, mourn. The field is laid waste, the land mourneth".
Rem. And the husbandmen too are addressed.
C.A.C. Everybody is to come into these exercises. The oblation and the drink-offering being cut off is the worst of all. What about Christ having come in for the pleasure of God, where does that come in?
Ques. Could you bring the Lord's supper into it?
C.A.C. I think there is a certain hint of it. God has restored the ministry of the Person of Christ, that new kind of humanity that required Him to come here to inaugurate it. The mass think everything is right; that is not exercise. What
{416}
Joel has in view is the residue. Peter quotes Joel to bring out the present character of God's working. Ye men of Judaea and the rest, he says (@Acts 2: 14). It is the residue -- that is what God is after. God is securing a residue now and the oblation and drink offering will be found there. So he says, "Turn unto Jehovah your God ... . Who knoweth? He might return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him, an oblation and a drink-offering for Jehovah your God" (chapter 2: 13,14).
Ques. Would you say a word on the drink-offering?
C.A.C. It was peculiar in this respect, that it was the only one of the offerings brought into the sanctuary. It was poured out in the sanctuary, so the cups and goblets of the drink-offering were identified with the offering in the sanctuary. The oblation was outside. It speaks of spiritual joy in spite of famine conditions. The public condition is that the vine is withered. If the conditions of @2 Timothy 2 are obeyed, God will draw near and leave behind Him an oblation and a drink-offering. I think God looks for us to feel these things. We shall hardly know much of sanctuary service, unless we know something of the conditions outside.
Before the day of Jehovah comes -- which is imminent and will bring in unsparing judgment, which is the prospect before Christendom -- something is secured in God's grace in the character of a remnant. God would make His people supremely happy, so that He would restore the years that the locust hath eaten. He has given back to those that sought Him earnestly the ministry that was departed from when the church broke away from what was of God. It finds out real affection; that is, our hearts cherish the Person of Christ in all that He is for God's delight, and we, as linked up with Him, become the new oblation -- for that is the assembly. There should be something about us attractive that is not to be found elsewhere; that is, the cherishing of Christ as the Man of God's delight. You value a bit of Christ anywhere, and that brings you to real church affections. It is found in Philadelphia, "Thou ... hast kept my word, and hast not
{417}
denied my name". It was holding on to what is so precious in Christ -- "my word" and "my name".
At the beginning of our dispensation, holy conditions were established before ever the Spirit came. All that has come in in Christ is intended to form us and not to be merely objective. How we appreciate Christ is the way we come out in His character. I cannot pretend to any more appreciation than that. I think God has taught us to shrink from what is outwardly great, and to appreciate all that is of value to Him. The great miss is the oblation and the drink-offering. The mark that He has come in is that we are furnished with them.
Rem. In Malachi the sons of Levi were purified in order to offer the pure oblation.
C.A.C. Yes, I think the present condition of Christendom is judicial, because it has turned away from what was committed to it. All is purposed to be done before the millennial position-it is before the day of Jehovah. God secures this residue, and the oblation and drink-offering, and the Spirit is poured out.
Rem. The millennium will be a very great day.
C.A.C. There will be no body of the ascended Man on the earth in the millennium, it belongs to the mystery hidden in God, which belongs to the present time, which is the greatest of all. The millennium will be in public display, and is spoken of by the prophets. Think of the assembly in God's sight, as set up in the Man of His good pleasure, apart from death, apart from sin, apart from the world, and apart from failure, perfect. Doleful Christians are giving the lie to everything that God has bestowed upon them in Christ. Peter speaks of exulting with joy unspeakable and full of glory. Think of glorified joy! I feel I know little about it, but I should like to know something of it. We want to get rid of the shams and shadows, these are the realities. Nothing is real except what God has established in Christ. We want everything that is not Christ in us to disappear, do we not? and wish we had more practical power for it. So that there is a condition ready for the Spirit. It is poured out upon all flesh
{418}
(not only for leading brothers), so that everyone participates in it. "Upon the bondmen and upon the handmaids", it says; that is, those of least account. All participate in it.
After reading Hosea I felt we wanted something on the positive line. There we had the amazing character of the love of God that cannot be turned aside. In spite of the departure and unfaithfulness of the people it is unchangeable. Joel is more the positive side and what can be enjoyed. Hosea shows the thought of relationship; Joel takes you behind that to be in the joy that is in those relationships. There is an enjoyment that goes along with these things that makes them substantial. The Spirit is poured out; it is as if God would not leave us without the power for the enjoyment of all He proposes to give. The Lord's great service here was to prepare a suitable vessel for the Spirit, and it was the prepared vessel on whom the Spirit was poured out. There is nothing we need to pray about more than the universal character of what we have entered into. So the speaking in tongues joins on with the pouring out of the Spirit; it showed God was moving on universal lines. So also we see in Corinthians. 'Tongues' today contradict the divine idea of tongues altogether.
All this enters into the service of God. If we do not take account of God's universal work, we are hardly fit to approach Him, because we are on individual lines. The moment you have passed the Supper, you are on what is universal, and there is nothing that is not suitable to the holy catholic church. It may be among a few weak ignorant men, but you find the great universal thoughts of God cherished, as by those knowing something of their value, confessing the lordship of Christ and His name here on earth locally, and identified with His death. In a certain sense we are there representatively. Every Christian in T. should be there (cf. @1 Corinthians 1: 12). There has been a revival of the truth concerning Christ and the Spirit, with the saints. There is one Spirit. A man said, 'Things are so broken that we cannot say anything about the universal unity of the Spirit', and I said, 'Is the Holy Spirit broken up?'
{419}
NOTES OF A READING
@Joel 2:20 - 32; @Joel 3: 13 - 21
C.A.C. @Acts 2 gives our link with Joel (cf. verses 28 - 32). Peter says, "This is that".
Ques. How does this passage link up with the last days?
C.A.C. It was the last days of God dealing with Israel. The whole of mankind is in view. "Is he the God of the Jews only?" Paul asks. The great secret of the whole matter is veiled. In Joel he does not give us any ground at all on which this comes to pass, though he speaks of the outpouring of the Spirit. It awaited the coming in of Christ, and the accomplishment of redemption and Jesus being raised and being glorified; all that was essential before the Spirit could be poured out. But he gives the barrenness and desolation of the present time and calls on the people to take it to heart. If they did God would turn and there would be fruitfulness and plenty instead of famine. All the years the cankerworm and palmer-worm had eaten would be restored. All these wonderful things He would do required the coming in of Christ to bring them in, and all these millennial blessings, which are spiritual, will be by the coming in of Christ. The incarnation was a great necessity in view of all this; that is, Jehovah would be known as in the midst of His people. It was verified when Emmanuel was there, expressing the power that would subdue all evil and bring in the blessing of God where the famine had been. There will not be such a witness to God in the millennium as there was in the days of the Son of man, days full of the blessedness of God set forth in the midst of famine and misery -- God set forth. Every blessing was there. It is a great thing for us to see the greatness of what was here -- God will not be walking down here in the millennium as a Man amongst men. He will be approached in the temple. They will never be able to wash the Lord's feet with their
{420}
tears or to lie in His bosom. They will not know the surpassing excellence in which God is known at the present time. All that comes in as preparatory to the outpouring of the Spirit, which was a suitable thing after God had been "manifest in flesh", and a remnant brought to receive Him as the Christ and Son of God. There is a suitability if the Spirit is poured out. He speaks of the cure of the famine; we know now that He has brought it in in Christ. So the means are provided so that we can approach with an oblation and a drink-offering. He may "return and repent, and leave a blessing behind him, an oblation and a drink-offering for Jehovah your God", it says. Well, that is just exactly what He came in for.
Ques. Why is it "all flesh"?
C.A.C. It shows the universality of the thoughts of God. As presented here it is in view of God being known, or God's mind being made known. That is, attention is called to the result in prophecy and spiritual understanding. So that the Spirit comes specially as enabling saints to speak.
Ques. With the Lord going to the Father and the Comforter coming would there be an extension?
C.A.C. With the great addition now that He was risen and glorified, so the Spirit would be connected with that. There was an extension of what was of God. It was there in one Man. The ascended Man has a body here on earth, and it is the vessel of testimony, the Spirit enables persons to prophesy. I think everything that is for God lies in the power of the Spirit. The right walking of the saints is in the power of the Spirit.
"All flesh" means it is not to be limited to Israel. It is to bring out the extensive character of the working of God. It speaks of dreams and visions. It is to cast us on the personal acting of the Spirit, it is something extra to the Scripture. There is not quite so much energy needed for dreaming as for visions, so the old men dream. There is such a thing as meditating in the Spirit so that our thoughts are carried in a spiritual channel. Seeing a vision is something more special,
{421}
and very near to a revelation. You get an apprehension of Christ you had not before. "I will manifest myself to him" in @John 14 is very like it. It requires spiritual energy, and we should look for this. There is a source of spiritual supply outside the Scripture. Every dream and vision must be subject to Scripture, and we have the Spirit that inspired the Scripture. It is possible for the Spirit to give us thoughts of God and Christ directly from Himself. A beloved servant of the Lord said he always received things by the Spirit, before he found them in Scripture. If a divine Person has come to dwell in us, we ought to understand the possibilities. The sin of Christendom is the ignoring of the Spirit and so the confusion has come in. The natural man has displaced the Spirit of God, it is the cause of the famine. There is continual freshness where the Spirit has His way, nothing is dried up. I believe, brethren, we ought to be exercised as to the personal action of the Spirit. It speaks of the "flow" of waters in chapter 3.
Rem. "Where there is no vision the people cast off restraint", it says (@Proverbs 29: 18).
C.A.C. What Peter saw (@Acts 10) was by the Spirit, and volume of instruction was in it as to the Gentiles. He would not have gone near Cornelius if he had not had that vision; and so with John.
Rem. @Jeremiah 31: 26 says, "I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me". If we were in the Spirit we should never be ashamed.
C.A.C. Therefore the thought of the day of the Lord is helpful. The Lord would deal with everything today we might be afraid of. Jehovah will take up His dealings with Judah and Jerusalem before that day. We have a little anticipation of that. God takes up His dealings with His people and the adversaries are not yet dealt with. He is taking account of all that is adverse to His people, and chastening them, and then presently deals with those very people He has used in chastisement.
At the present time the grace of God predominates, so it remains true that "Whosoever shall call upon the name of
{422}
Jehovah shall be saved"; it remains true all through this period. The assembly took the place of Zion and Judah at the day of Pentecost. The assembly was the place where salvation was found. There the Lord added such as should be saved, and it is the same now. And as God dwells there, a testimony goes out, as in Corinth, a testimony that God is among His people.
Rem. The last word in Ezekiel is, "Jehovah is there".
C.A.C. And therefore everything must be judged; and so the nations come to the valley of Jehoshaphat. Everything contrary to God must be judged.
Ques. Would that be the thought of the sickle in @Revelation 14?
C.A.C. Yes, harvest and vintage are figures of judgment. The Lord is constant in judging all that goes on in the assembly.
Ques. What does it mean by the sun being darkened and the moon turned into blood?
C.A.C. It will mean the withdrawal of all heavenly light.
There is a blaze of heavenly light today. It is a terrible thing when God will withdraw light from men because it has not been appreciated. It is very solemn that men and countries that have had light are turning away. And they come up to battle; we read they make war with the Lamb. The "valley of decision" is where everything is determined. God must bring everything to judgment. Every human being will find himself in the valley of decision some day; everything will be brought to a head. He will be faithful to His people whenever He has to act in judgment.
Rem. "The gifts and calling of God are not subject to repentance".
{423}
MINISTRY ON AMOS
{424}
{425}
SUBSTANCE OF A READING
@Amos 1: 1, 2; @Amos 2: 4 - 16
Amos was the bearer of Jehovah's message at a time when the people of God were in a sad state of departure; therefore the time corresponds very much with the present time. Amos represents the sovereign action of God in giving suitable prophetic words, and shows how God can take up anyone. Amos was just a farm labourer, not of much account in Israel; he was following his daily toil when Jehovah took him up and bade him prophesy.
It tells us that the time of his prophecy was "two years before the earthquake". That is the time, in principle, for all prophetic ministry. All prophecy in Scripture takes its character from the fact that God is about to take some matter in hand, and He gives testimony prophetically to His people of what is coming, so that we may be warned. Thus there are two sides to the earthquake; that is, before the clearance of all things in judgment God shows how He can overturn evil in the way of grace and truth. There are many earthquakes alluded to in Scripture; one took place when Jesus rose from the dead. There had already been an earthquake when He died, and there was a great earthquake when He arose, showing that God has shaken all that man boasts in from its very foundation. What is all the boast of man in the presence of the cross of Christ?
Prophecy is to give us peace as to what is coming on the earth; so Jesus said when He prophesied. "For three transgressions ... and for four" is to give space to repent; God moves slowly in judgment. These spoken of in Amos chapters 1 and 2 were nations occupying land round Israel, and nations having come into contact with christianity stand in a
{426}
special responsibility. In each case it says, "Because ...". The sentence of judgment on all the evil has gone forth, Israel and Judah being included also on this ground. What is going on now is a mere trifle to what is coming on the earth.
I am persuaded that the crowning sin of the present dispensation will be the murder of the saints. The end of the Jewish dispensation was the crucifixion of Christ, and so the end of the christian dispensation will be the murder of the saints.
Hence God roars. Nothing can prevent God speaking and that in the midst of His people. He is doing that now. The whole book of Revelation is very much like the roaring of the lion. No one could be surprised at anything happening in the world who reads that book. These things should be known in the assemblies of His people. The Christian has clear light; he should know exactly what is going to happen. The judgment in this chapter is almost invariably for cruelty to the people of God. Moab is an exception, exhibiting an extraordinary unnaturalness of action. It shows how God is observant even of how the nations make war.
The most important matter at present is the gathering out of joint heirs with Christ, and the judgment of the nations may have to wait, it is a sideline. The main line is the gathering out of the joint heirs with Christ. He will judge the nations as surely as the sun will rise tomorrow morning. The four transgressions have not yet been reached by any of the nations. When it comes to Judah and Israel they have been in the primary place of relationship. The truth of christian fellowship is not accepted with most as an obligation -- that God has called all believers to the fellowship of His Son, of His death, of His body and blood, and of the Spirit. The obligation rests on all believers. The present condition of Christendom is a despising of the truth of @1 Corinthians 12: 13, that we have all been baptised by one Spirit into one body. Lies have caused them to err (chapter 2: 4). If my opinion is a lie, what good is it to me? "After which their fathers walked" -- what have the commandments of the Lord to do with all that?
{427}
The testimony of Amos embraces both Judah and Israel. Israel was corrupting the two things that God intended should be in Israel. God intended there should be prophecy and that that would bring about Nazariteship. They are two important features today. The ministry of prophecy is a part of the order of the assembly. There is the communication of God's mind through prophetic gift, and Nazariteship, that is, a definite dedication to His service in separation. That is what the Lord is looking for from us all now, that we should be Nazarites. No young man is worth his salt unless he starts as dedicated to the Lord. Nothing can deprive any of us from that service. The only one who can is oneself! Satan is set against it; he is always saying to the prophets, "Prophesy not", and giving the Nazarites wine to drink (chapter 2: 12). Let our concern be that nothing should distract us from the Lord. The whole clerical system is a silencing of the prophets; the unconverted man may be in the pulpit and the prophet in the pew unable to speak. The prophetic word results in separation to the Lord, so that we gladly take up separation to the Lord.
The judgment of what is evil is never God's terminus, He has always something good in view.

All through the prophets a remnant is spoken of. The end God always has in view is to secure a remnant -- very small perhaps -- for His pleasure; and in chapter 3: 12, there is a remnant in Judah to hear His speaking and to walk in His ways. God sets great value on the remnant. He is always adverse to us when our ways displease Him; it is essential to His character. "With the perverse thou dost show thyself contrary"; that is, the lion roars. "Shall two walk together
{428}
except they be agreed?" (chapter 3: 3) is a very wide principle. It is wonderful in a day like this to walk with God as knowing His mind, and to profit by His ways. If He corrects me it is a benefit to me, something to be thankful for; I am not to resent it. Israel was indifferent to God's ways. If any attend to God's ways with them, they will be found in the remnant. The mass do not recognise that He has any ways with them; christendom has departed. Many were sick and some had fallen asleep at Corinth; God had a controversy with them and they had not noticed it. Many things happen to us individually and assemblywise that we are intended to notice, but we do not notice them and miss the blessing.
"Shall there be evil in a city, and Jehovah not have done it?" Evil in verse 6 is in the sense of what is adverse. The trumpet is a testimony among God's people that is to be heeded. If you do what is contrary, something will touch it in a meeting and you will know it, though nobody else does. A man dropped into a meeting once and fell on his face recognising that "God is indeed amongst you". If all were walking with God, nothing adverse would come into the assembly but what would be pointed out by the prophets, though no eye had seen it. 'Who told you about me?' people often complain. We should expect the secrets of the heart to be made manifest. "The secrets of his heart are manifested", it says (@1 Corinthians 14: 25). God's ways in government and prophetic ministry are to be attended to; we must not get hardened or He will be adverse to us. They are His ways with the christian profession, and we are part of it. The lion roaring is some very grave action on God's part to produce fear; for instance the circumstances in Europe today (World War 2) are very like it, very like a time when the Lord is roaring.
"Jehovah hath spoken". The roaring is not defined. God speaks intelligently, and because he speaks the prophets have to speak. Every bomb falling is the lion roaring; it is meant for people to fear and be brought into the "remnant" because it is God acting. In the case of Job, behind was Satan and behind Satan was God. God was acting. We need to
{429}
cultivate sensitiveness in God's acting with us. It is going on all the time, going on all day and all night; we ought to turn to Him. God is getting a remnant in all the countries of Europe and making men hear. It may only be two legs or a piece of an ear (chapter 3: 12), but it is precious to the Shepherd. We want to be set on this, that our walk is right. Two legs speak of ability to walk and to please God, and a piece of an ear represents some ability to hear. "The Lord gives the word" (@Psalm 68: 11). If we were simple we should never come together for a ministry meeting without the saints getting a word. "Great the host of the publishers". It is a word for the sisters. It is encouraging that sisters have a leading part in prophecy. The word 'publishers' is feminine, showing that it can be taken up in a feminine way. The best word ever given to the brethren was given by a sister (@John 20). They are just as much joints and bands as brothers are, by which nourishment reaches the members from the Head. Can you receive something from the Head? A sister may get something direct from the Head that will be of benefit to the body down here. If so, a sister is sure to speak about it and, like a snowball, it gets bigger at every turn. It is better to pass on a spiritual impression rather than notes; a living impression is a vital matter.
We may have a Bethel and a Gilgal and get formal and dead (chapter 4: 4, 5). Bethel and Gilgal were two most honourable places, but we might do all just to please ourselves. It shows that the form of things was going on, but it was all self-pleasing. I want you to return to *Me*, He says; and in chapter 5: 4, 5, "Seek ye me, and ye shall live. And seek not Bethel, neither go to Gilgal" -- wonderful places in the past. Seek me and you will live. "Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live" (verse 14), it is a vital matter. "As ye say" in that verse is striking. Talking of bringing the Lord with them into religious ruts is true of all christendom; we might get into them too; what we want is *life*. So He is turning many from all these things into vital connection with Himself.

@Amos 5: 18 - 27
The very fact that God sent a prophet to Israel showed that He had not given them up. There is a remnant spoken of in verse 15, "Hate evil, and love good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that Jehovah, the God of hosts, will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph". The main burden of this prophet is that the people should seek Jehovah; and so now the great thing is that the Lord should be sought; He can be sought, though as we were seeing, He is glorified in heaven. We carry about with us what God says cannot be subject (@Romans 8: 7), and so we must always judge it.
"Woe unto you that desire the day of Jehovah! To what end is the day of Jehovah for you?" (verse 18). The people had not offered sacrifices for forty years but were carrying idolatrous gods (verses 25 - 27). The whole professing body today professes to want the kingdom of God to come when they have not the slightest intention of giving up their own wills. "To what end is the day of Jehovah for you?" The Scriptures anticipate everything that men are likely to say or to do. "Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in this time; for it is an evil time" (verse 13). It shows that there is power in silence sometimes, that we are not always to be denouncing what is evil; it is better sometimes to be silent as to what is wrong. We should be exponents of what is right, and that is the most powerful rebuke of what is wrong; God has pleasure in what is right, "Let judgment roll down as waters, and righteousness as an ever-flowing stream" (verse 24). The offerings of Israel were accompanied by a moral state that made them offensive to God. They were imitating the choicest period in the time of David, but they did not feel the condition Godward. It is an exercise for us all to be genuine in all that we take up as service. Going on with God will preserve us. We ought to have as clear a judgment as Amos had, of the evil in
{431}
the christian profession before the judgment comes. A plentiful supply of judgment and righteousness should mark the people of God. We should feel much more than we do the state of the church -- it is not grieved at; how few there are to mourn over the state of the church. Those who are near to Christ must do so. You cannot appreciate what the ruin is until you get out of it. The remnant is spoken of as "the remnant of Joseph" (verse 15) because he has the ten tribes largely in view. They had set up idolatry as a system of worship and it was their destruction. And so it is today, and it is not felt as being contrary to God, as contrary to what was set up in the power of the Spirit at the beginning. "That say ... Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression" (chapter 4: 4). If we took it to heart we should cleave more to the Lord and value more what is spiritual.
Chapter 7 is very important as showing how the Lord acted with His servant so that Amos might be in accord with His own thoughts.

@Amos 7: 1 - 9; @Amos 8: 1 - 3
The four things shown to Amos by Jehovah at the beginning of chapters 7 and 8 were important instruction for him at that period in the history of Israel, and they are not the less important for us. "Thus did the Lord Jehovah shew unto me; and behold, he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth, and behold, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings". "The king's mowings" have reference to the previous dealings of God with Israel; there had been a long course of His dealings with them from the time that they broke away from Judah. The object His dealings have in view is that what is of God may arise. As we see from @2 Kings 14: 26, 27, there was a remarkable
{432}
intervention of God just at that time so that there was a period of restoration and recovery, Jeroboam restoring the border of Israel. I think that is what Amos refers to as "the latter growth". We might compare with it the last hundred years and those from the time of the Reformation. God was obliged, as the departure reached a peak, to do one of two things: to bring in judgment or recovery; and instead of judgment He granted a wonderful time of recovery, and it has been going on ever since, so that it is a time of the latter growth. In Sardis and Philadelphia we get somewhat the thought of the latter growth. Nevertheless God was still dealing with them.
It says that the locusts had "wholly eaten the grass of the land" and that the fire "devoured the great deep, and ate up the inheritance". It was a serious exercise which brought Amos to his knees -- every evidence of revival eaten up! But for the intercession of Christ there would not be anything. The object of God's public ways is to reduce His people. The ways of God now are all on the line of reduction, because when we are small God can do something with us. Peter, Paul, Jude and John all tell of judgment coming. What is interesting is that the judgment that was about to fall on God's people had been promised in the days of Jeroboam, Baasha, Ahab and Jehu; but Amos pleads for the people, and in answer to that the judgment was suspended for a while -- at least for twenty-five years, for Jeroboam's reign was long -- and space was given for repentance. Then the inheritance was destroyed and the people were carried away to Assyria. This prophetic ministry came in to support the deliverance of God by Jeroboam; that is, there was a moral deliverance to be brought about by the ministry of Amos. Jehovah's own compassionate feelings were reflected in Amos; and so now the compassions of Christ are expressed in His people. In the prayer meeting supplication is made for the whole Christian profession. Sardis and Philadelphia are the outcome of the compassion of God and of the intercession of Christ. Jehovah suspended the judgment for the sake of the remnant of whom
{433}
Amos was the representative; the governmental dealings of God and the intercession of Christ go together. Jacob will never rise up unless he is helped; he cannot help himself. I believe that this great war (1939 - 45) is intended by God to reduce His people to dependence on Him; God can do anything with us when we are small. We can plan to do nothing when bombs are falling about us. God's people are brought down small so that He can do anything with us. What is of God in the establishment around us is being reduced publicly. Evangelical appointments are far fewer than they were fifty or a hundred years ago. Their lost influence is mourned, but the witness will be found with the remnant. It came down to only two of the assembly -- "Two of you" -- that is a quorum.
There is a great resource in the days of apostasy; what follows is the plumb-line. So that if we accept the exercise of the locusts and the fire, that is, that God is about to deal judicially with everything that displeases Him in the Christian profession, we shall be ready to move on to the wall and the plumb-line. That is to say, separation is a wall built by a plumb-line and not by the will of man; it is the practical working of divine principles. The plumb-line is in the hand of Jehovah; it is the application of divine principles to what exists practically. "Thus did he shew unto me; and behold, the Lord stood upon a wall made by a plumb-line, with a plumb-line in his hand" (verse 7). That is what the Lord has done in the last days of the church's history; He has set up a testimony in separation to the practicability of divine principles. He was prepared to set up what was right as a testimony in Israel if there had been faithful men, and He is prepared to do it now for the saints of the assembly; and such will have His support, for God is prepared to stand by them as He stood on the wall here.
The fourth thing that Jehovah showed to Amos is in chapter 8; "Thus did Jehovah shew unto me; and behold, a basket of summer-fruit". "A basket of summer-fruit" I can only suppose to be a symbol of what Jehovah looked for in His
{434}
people (see @Micah 7: 1, 2). It represents what the Spirit of Christ looked for but failed to find, and in one sense that is the most terrible thing of all, to think that the church has so entirely failed to bring forth what the heart of Christ desired. Whatever He looked for in Israel He did not get; and what Christ looks for in His assembly -- we know it -- He has failed to get. We know well what our basket of summer-fruit is; from the gospels and epistles we can learn what the Lord looks for for the satisfaction of His heart. We can read it; we can pray over it, and we can lament that the Lord gets so little of it. What does He get from me? All these things carry condemnation with them, and if there is a little bit for Christ anywhere what condemnation it is! The object of prophetic ministry is to give us feelings. The prophets are permeated with divine feelings and are jealous for God, as the vehemence of their denunciations shows. That which the saints are for the pleasure of Christ, what He said of them on earth and from heaven -- put it all together and what a basket of summer-fruit it is! Then look at the church and see what a failure it is, see how little of it has come into living expression. The ground on which the church will be condemned will be that it has not answered to the pleasure of Christ; instead she has become the "mother of the harlots" -- nothing could be more terrible.
FROM C.A.C.S NOTEBOOK
@Amos 7:1 - 6; @Amos 9:9, 11
What is in my mind is to say a word about three things: <ol><li>The chastening of God,</li><li>The faithfulness of God, and</li><li>The work of God.</li></ol>
These things are important for God's saints to understand at all times, and particularly as the end of God's ways draws
{435}
near. I have no doubt that these verses from Amos refer particularly to His ways with Israel, but they have a very distinct bearing upon ourselves, especially as being in a time when God's chastening hand is very specially upon the nations and upon His people.
What we find here is that God calls for the two visitations, the locusts in the first verse and the consuming fire in the fourth verse, His having in view that what is typified by the grass of the land should be reduced. Grass in Scripture is a very familiar type of the flesh and the greatness of man, and God deals with His people in order to reduce it.
There is a time referred to as "the king's mowings", "the latter growth after the king's mowings". The King's mowings took place at the cross. It was there it was cut down and had no place. Then there is a latter growth that springs up after the mowings -- a shooting up of the greatness of the flesh in God's people even after this, and it is the shooting up of the flesh that necessitates His chastening. It is the shooting up of what was cut down at the cross.
We know God can prevent this shooting up of the flesh; He did with Paul; He gave him a thorn for the flesh that he might be consistent with his name Paul, which is 'small'. Jacob is small. He is dealing with us to keep us small and precious in His sight. No one ever heard of a huge pearl, even a large one is relatively small; and what yields pleasure in the sight of God is small. The locusts and the consuming fire are all to keep us small, for only that which has that character will go through into the world to come. Anything else comes under God's chastening; any movement of greatness in us causes God to deal with us in chastening love, blessed be His name! None of us wants the flesh to go on flourishing, we want it to be cut down, and the blessed God says, 'I will send locusts and consuming fire to keep it small'. Then there is no longer need when we become small. Twice over the passage says, "How shall Jacob arise? for he is small". That is, he is so small that he can only arise by the power of God -- what a blessed point to be brought to, beloved brethren. When we
{436}
realise that nothing about us has any value but what God has wrought in us, it is a day when we have found out our true measure. None of us will find it is very great. When we have reached that, God has reached His end. The object in His chastening ways is to reduce His saints to what they are as His work as their divine measure. He is dealing with us in view of His work -- in view of conditions suited to His love, the world of which His Son is the Sun and Centre. So His chastening is a continual necessity to every one of us.
In chapter 9: 9 we have the next thing. That is, God's faithfulness to preserve what has the character of smallness. He is not out to preserve what is great, it is obnoxious to Him, He is out to preserve what is small. His faithfulness comes out in this, though His providential ways may be a shaking, and He is shaking His people -- shaking them to and fro -- but not the least grain of His own work will be lost. It is to bring us down to the dimensions of His own work in us, and then we shall always realise that we are small. Oh, beloved brethren, do we not covet to bear such a character that it is God's pleasure to preserve us, so that not the least grain falls upon the earth?
This is preparatory to the great matter that is before us, so that nothing may reduce or prevent the great thing that God has before Him, what He is doing at the present time for His own pleasure. It is in order that we may have part in what He is doing.
So I read verse 11. I think it has an application in the present time. "In that day I raise up the tabernacle of David which is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old". You will observe this expression, "the tabernacle of David"; it is not, the city of David -- that would represent what is abiding in all the stability of resurrection. The tabernacle of David signifies that it can be ruined. It answers to the church set up in responsibility here -- a provisional thought, not permanent; but as belonging to a transitory period. So the Lord Jesus Christ set up His church here in a provisional way and
{437}
committed it to the responsibility of man. The result is that the tabernacle has fallen and is a heap of ruins. But is God quiescent in that state of things? If He recovers and preserves His saints, it is in order that they may be prepared to work with Him at the present time. He is restoring the features of the assembly in a remnant in view of translation. It is not that He will restore a public body, for it is going to be the subject of His judgment very soon.
Now He wants our co-operation, beloved brethren. It cannot be done, and I speak reverently, apart from our cooperation. Satan has brought about public failure by taking away affection from the assembly of God. Breakdown soon came in, almost at the start, until nothing was left to bear truthful witness to what Christ set up. Well, God is waiting to bring about a restoration of true assembly affections. How could Christ come otherwise? It is by the restoring work going on now that we are fitted for that glorious day of which we were singing, of which 'the Star's in the sky'. Let us give ourselves to this, with our whole heart and soul and mind give ourselves to the promotion of it. It is to be restored in a remnant which will work out as the pearl.
I think it is worked out in view of the tabernacle of David being set up again. David is the man after God's own heart and the assembly in its true character is after His own heart. It is worked out in individuals.
NOTES OF A READING
@Amos 9: 7 - 15
C.A.C. The prophecy of Amos at Bethel is a remarkable testimony to the patience of Jehovah with a people who had departed from Him. Bethel no longer had the character of the house of God. Amaziah said, "The land is not able to bear all his words". If God's word is refused He takes it away
{438}
(see chapter 8: 11, 12). "Behold, days come, saith the Lord Jehovah, when I will send a famine ... of hearing the words of Jehovah". Forty years ago a servant of the Lord said, 'The Bible ceases to be light from God', and it is more true now, though copies of the Scriptures are multiplied. What comes from God is the only security for men. When lawlessness breaks out men will feel the great loss they have sustained in the undermining of the Scriptures. Persons unable to cope with it will long for the restraint and comfort of the word of God and will not be able to find it.
Ques. Will they have bibles?
C.A.C. Oh yes, they will have bibles.
Ques. What will the Scriptures be to them?
C.A.C. A bit of ancient literature, as it is now for many. Meanwhile, God does not descend from His own standard, as we see in chapter 9 where the Lord is standing upon the altar. I think that indicates that God does not depart from His own standard of holiness. The altar, of course, speaks of the death of Christ; and that remains God's standard, and there is no right or holy basis for anything in this world but the death of Christ.
Rem. It speaks of judgment too. In @Psalm 22, "And thou art holy, thou that dwellest amid the praises of Israel".
C.A.C. Yes. The altar is expressly said to be "Holiness of holinesses", which is the strongest expression used of holiness. It is the same expression as that used of the holiest of all.
God cannot endure the flesh. The only way of escape for any child of Adam is the death of Christ. God has made a holy way out, has He not? That evil is abhorrent to the nature of God is shown in the death of Christ; anything not in harmony with that must go. The Lord stands there to express His judgment of everything that is going on in Israel.
The plumb-line would speak of righteousness; there is no better illustration of it. And it is also a constructive idea; a wall is constructed according to the rectitude of the divine standard.
{439}
Rem. "Him who knew not sin he has made sin for us, that we might become God's righteousness in him" (@2 Corinthians 5: 21).
C.A.C. And the result of that apprehended would be that righteousness would mark us. The plumb-line is to be applied at every point. It looks in this chapter as if all was excluded in Israel, yet verse 8 says, "Only that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith Jehovah". Very beautiful is the introduction of a reserved remnant. All through the church period there is a remnant of Israel reserved as an elect remnant. Israel will be shaken, it says, "like as one shaketh corn in a sieve; yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth". He is looking after His grain. And He is going to rebuild all that has fallen down. "I will raise up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old".
Ques. Why is the tabernacle connected with David here?
C.A.C. Because I think the dispensation realised its full glory in David. He was the man after God's own heart.
Ques. Would it be in the sense that the service of God continued through all generations?
C.A.C. Yes. Things in that dispensation came to a climax under David. In our dispensation we have come to the reality of that which is typified. We know Him in that character, we have to do with David. He says to Philadelphia, "These things saith the holy, the true; he that has the key of David ...", and in @Revelation 22, "I Jesus ... I am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star". That which came in of David, of Christ as David, was committed to man's responsibility and has fallen down. It was divinely perfect in every detail but has fallen and is now a hopeless ruin, and that is the condition today.
Ques. Would @Acts 15: 16, 17 be some of the "prophetic scriptures" referred to in @Romans 16: 26?
C.A.C. Yes. James stood up to support the new departure there in @Acts 15.
Rem. God secures that which can be carried over into His purpose.
C.A.C. The only way out of the confusion is to have
{440}
divine thoughts built up in our souls. That is the character of the church today, God's original thoughts set out by the apostles being built up in souls. The thing now is to get the truth built into souls, that is what God is working. It is not exactly anything new. It says here, "I will build it as in the days of old"; that is, going back to the original thoughts. And it is open to all saints. These thoughts in themselves cannot be ruined. Great and precious thoughts of God have been made known by the apostles and we are to walk together in the light and power -- where there is power -- of them.
The tabernacle of David in one sense is the whole divine system brought in by Christ and set up in the power of the Spirit. As built up in souls, it prepares for blessing, so there is no gap in the agricultural year, there is always something going on.
Rem. It has been said that these prophetic books all end on a hopeful note.
C.A.C. And the whole Bible ends on that note-the holy city. Revelation is a book of judgments, yet it finishes with the bride and the Lamb, and the holy city coming down. This scripture will be literally true for Israel in the millennium, but there is a far greater thing coming. The millennium is not only limited (it is not eternal) but it is an inferior order of blessing.
Rem. There is wonderful blessing connected with the millennium too.
C.A.C. Well, you do not want it in your circumstances now. We must not let the earthly side occupy our minds. Our own position, what God has given to us in Christ, is of a heavenly order. So we might be miserable in our circumstances, but in triumph in our portion; that is possible. I suppose Paul had a miserable life, and he said, "I die daily"; that is, he was continually ill-treated and spoken against, but he was always rejoicing in connection with his portion in Christ in heaven. The work of God now is to build up the truth in souls; then we shall be sure to walk together.
{441}
Rem. The cities shall be built, it says.
C.A.C. That is, the local assemblies; as the truth forms them they are brought to walk together. It is not a question of 'getting into fellowship'. We want to get away from the outward to what God is doing to build up the truth of God in souls. You could not have six people built up in the truth without their being together according to the assembly of God. Thousands of saints have found this to be a great reality. There is always a harmony and correspondence in the ways of God whatever the dispensation may be, and we see a correspondence in what God is doing in the assembly with what He was doing in Israel. We belong to a dispensation that is ruined, that is, the truth as committed to man's responsibility, all that is ruined. The truth that is built up in our souls cannot be ruined. There is no time lost; for saints walking in the truth there will always be something going on; there is no break in the continuity of the labour. The thing to be concerned about is that what is connected with our system should be built up in our souls. Then we shall become firm, a wall built by a plumb-line.
Ques. It says, "The mountains shall drop new wine, and all the hills shall melt"; would you explain that?
C.A.C. And it is all for a people who have forfeited everything and who are in captivity. For us it is the fulness of heavenly blessing, and who could describe that? I suppose few of us know much about what that is.
The church was in ruins when Paul wrote, "All seek their own things, not the things of Jesus Christ" (@Philippians 2: 21). Well, that is ruin, is it not? I hope we shall be encouraged to go in for the full wealth of God.

@Micah 5: 4 - 15
C.A.C. We need to see that a divine Person has come in to take charge of His flock. He came out of Bethlehem as the Offspring of David, but then He was also the Root of David. He was the eternal God coming into manhood to take up shepherd service, as we read in the beginning of Matthew. He was to shepherd God's people Israel; so that the strength of Jehovah and the majesty of the name of Jehovah are brought into exercise in His service, which gives it an exalted character.
The ruling in verse 2 is ruling in shepherd character, it is so translated by the Spirit in @Matthew 2. It was in the mind of Jehovah to bring all His care and blessing near to man in that character. So that they gained immensely by having such a One for Shepherd. He knew perfectly what God's care was and could pass it on and make it available. Think of the wonderful influence that was among the disciples when the Lord was here, for there was One in their midst who knew perfectly Jehovah's thoughts about them.
Ques. Would the thought in shepherding be that they should learn God?
C.A.C. Yes; we can learn from the Psalms what Jehovah was to Christ. Now, He brought that among His own in the gospels. There is now a further thought, the Father's name enters into it. We have little idea what it meant to them when the disciples heard from His lips, "My Father", "Your Father". It must have been the most astonishing thing to them in the sermon on the mount. It had never been heard of or thought of before, and we ought to take it as the most blessed thing. There never had been a man on earth who
{446}
knew God as Father till Jesus was here. So that the majesty and power of the Father's name all enter into the shepherd care; it all enters into what He feeds His flock upon.
It was brought here in His Person. I think we need to move more to Christ's side of things, forgetting our own side altogether, and think of what was here for Him, extended to His disciples -- what rested on Him. Well, all that entered into His shepherd care. How much is needed to bring the flock into that. There is a divine product in the sheep, and they have necessities; and no one can meet the requirements of their nature but divine Persons. It is nature, not light. They are the Father's first. The saints have certain necessities that attach to their very nature as subjects of the work of God, and the Shepherd ministers with divine skill to those necessities. "He shall stand and feed his flock in the strength of Jehovah, in the majesty of the name of Jehovah his God"; and we of course now bring in the name of Father.
Ques. Do we learn to know Christ and to know God by feeding? "This is the eternal life, that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent" (@John 17: 3).
C.A.C. I think the sheep have to be fed into it. It is most important that we should be fed into these things, so that they become characteristic of us, part of ourselves.
Rem. "I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine, as the Father knows me and I know the Father" (@John 10: 14, 15).
C.A.C. The sheep take on His character that way.
Ques. Would it be @John 17?
C.A.C. I think @John 17 is the full product, what He would feed us up to, so that He would be able to refer to us as He does there (cf. verse 6). It has come to maturity, so to speak.
And it says, "They shall abide", which is another link with John. "Abide" is a characteristic word in John's gospel and epistles, showing how important the permanency of things is.
{447}
There is no 'in and out' is there? So there is no thought of perishing with it. It says, "They shall never perish".
It is good to take account of the saints as the flock, not merely as those who have made confession of Christ; they are the flock of God. And the service is to go on on that footing. The Lord fed and preserved them from that standpoint, the thought of failure does not come in. It is most important that the Son of God coming here among His own brought all the value of what was in Himself upon them. They are detached from the world and attached to Him, and all the value of what is in Him is theirs. And all that makes Christ personally precious -- our learning what has come in Him; it is the positive side.
Rem. Peace is not an element, but He is it, He is Peace.
C.A.C. That is most important; and He is great to the ends of the earth, showing that Israel is too small for Him. Some of His greatness has entered into this room tonight. What a large place and company we are in. And every saint is a vessel of the greatness of Christ. The poorest and most backward saint has some sense of the greatness of Christ, and if we do not think much of him, he is a very important person in the eyes of heaven. That is exactly what God is doing now, bringing the greatness of Christ into hearts. And it is in view of the power of the enemy, because it is the Assyrian. "This man shall be Peace"; it is after having said this that the Assyrian is mentioned. And it is not He makes peace, or gives peace, but He is Peace. How wonderful to be close to a Person with whom there is no unrest or misgiving, for no unrest or misgiving ever entered His heart.
Ques. It says, "When the Assyrian shall come into our land, and when he shall tread in our palaces; then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight princes of men". Does that indicate that some will be raised up to meet this power, shepherds and princes?
C.A.C. That is very good, because the Assyrian is the violent power. Assyria is the last enemy; the false religion of
{448}
corruption has been destroyed before Assyria comes up. What a fortification in which to be set up. "This man shall be Peace". So the Lord says to the disciples, "These things have I spoken to you that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye have tribulation; but be of good courage: I have overcome the world". And it was just after saying they would be killed. 'Well', He says, 'In me ye shall have peace'. As we draw near the end I am satisfied that violence will have more and more place in this world; there will be active opposition and cruelty. So we find in Revelation and in Daniel the little horn makes war with the saints. I do not say the assembly will have the worst of it, but it may have a little touch. So at the present time God is using the violence for purifying. It is no use trying to get above it, you must go under it to get the blessing. But you start with, "This man shall be Peace".
Rem. When the doors were shut for fear of the Jews, Jesus comes into the midst and speaks peace to them.
C.A.C. And so the apostles do not show any sign of fear in @Acts 4. They say, "Now, Lord, look upon their threatenings"; and if some are shaken up and distressed, we have the privilege of reporting what is happening.
Rem. And they say, Give thy servants boldness.
C.A.C. It is the atheists and those opposed to God that would crush God's people -- Babylon is not in the ascendant now, it is the Assyrian. But He gives His people power to meet even the Assyrian. I do think we need to pray as to these things, so that what we have in Christ and in His Person is more to us than anything else in heaven or earth.
Ques. Is this the thought of those who take up rule and oversight and princes who give a lead in dignity?
C.A.C. We want shepherds and princes, that is how the Assyrian is met, not by soldiers. So that the hostile power will go down before those shepherds and princes who are in the dignity of the anointing. Now the thing is to go on with that. God has His own. No one would have thought that God would have silenced the enemy and the avenger by praise out
{449}
of the mouths of babes and sucklings; it comes out in @Psalm 8. So the praises of the saints can do that; they can hold back the power of evil. We may not think so, but it is true.
Ques. What about the numbers, seven and eight?
C.A.C. We can understand seven, the perfection of the thing -- for the earth. We want more of the shepherd spirit to meet the energy of evil round us, and then also the moral dignity of the princes. Eight is connected with eternity. We can see there is a beautiful moral order in this. It is a most instructive part of Scripture.
Rem. It says the remnant of Jacob shall be as the dew, and then as a lion in judgment.
C.A.C. Then the remnant of Jacob gets an extended mission, and becomes a shower of dew far and wide. It is wonderful to think it will all be literally carried out after the Lord has taken up His throne in Jerusalem. It will take place historically. The Assyrian (the king of the north in Daniel) will come up, and he will be destroyed, and there will be a spreading abroad of the knowledge of God, and Judah will move about like the dew to bring it about. It is the *persons*, not the doctrine here. Moses said, "My doctrine ... shall flow down as dew" (@Deuteronomy 32: 2). Here it is what they are; they bring an impression of God wherever they go. Certain persons are going to treat them kindly, and because they do so, not because they believe the gospel, they will come into eternal life; and it is simply because they have done something they were unaware of. The Lord says, 'You were kind to Me'. And the saints are surely a blessing on earth by what they are, or they ought to go to heaven at once. Two people were blessed through merely watching two sisters pass frequently in one direction. They wanted to find the attraction, so one day they followed and came to the meeting, and were converted on the spot.
If the dew is refused, there is nothing but judgment, and the saints will execute judgment on those that refuse grace. It is remarkable that the Psalms finish almost on that note in
{450}
the midst of all the praises. "To execute upon them the judgment written. This honour have all his saints" (@Psalm 149: 9). But it is a solemn honour.
The closing section is important because it shows God will not have any natural power in His service. He will have no natural means used in His conflicts. He has been teaching us all along what His great power is and He says, 'Now I am going to destroy every element in you that is not suitable to divine service'.
The chapter comes back to a serious word for all in the divine conflict, and we all are to be in it. Paul says, "The arms of our warfare are not fleshly, but powerful according to God to the overthrow of strongholds; overthrowing reasonings and every high thing that lifts itself up against the knowledge of God, and leading captive every thought into the obedience of the Christ" (@2 Corinthians 10: 5). Well, I take it that was in himself. I once heard J.N.D. say he did not see why the assembly should be the only place on earth where the lawless will of man could go unrestrained. You and I should see that there should be nothing with us that God cannot connect with Himself, otherwise wonderful as the things I say or do may be, they are nothing, because God cannot connect Himself with them.
NOTES OF A READING
@Micah 6: 1 - 8
Ques. How would you account for the extraordinary change in expression in verse 1 of this chapter?
C.A.C. He comes back to deal with the moral state of the people. The previous chapter is prophetic and looks on to the end of His ways and Messiah's ways, making them victorious over all their enemies, and setting aside in them all that was natural and human. That finishes that section of the
{451}
prophecy -- the ultimate triumph of God in the blessing of His people. First He uses them as dew, then as judgment.
This chapter deals with their moral state, and He shows He has a controversy with His people. It is humbling to think of it, but the matter of controversy is rather a strange one. It is not their behaviour towards Him, but His behaviour towards them that is the controversy. And He says in verse 3, "O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me". He assumes His people would not have turned away from Him without cause, and He wants to know what it is. Tell me, have I done anything that you do not like? What have I done wrong? It is a very touching appeal; there is something pathetic about it. It is extraordinary that God should take such ground with a creature.
Rem. He tells them what He has done.
C.A.C. He condescends to go over all His ways with them, to remind them that all through from Egypt to the end of the wilderness He had not omitted to do a single thing that was favourable to them; so they really had no ground of complaint. God's people often turn aside and seek their comfort and happiness somewhere else. It is as much as to say God has displeased us.
Rem. It shows He has very sensitive feelings.
C.A.C. Yes, He cannot bear that His people should think badly of Him; that is what it amounts to. He would even remind us of how He has taken us up, and it would settle a thousand questions if we just kept before its that we are a redeemed people. In His redemption certainly He had triumphed gloriously and He had secured a people for Himself in His own way.
Ques. Why does it bring in the mountains and hills in verses 1 and 2?
C.A.C. He wants them all to know if His people have a complaint against Him. If they have, He would like it publicly known. God regards it as a public matter, He would like all the universe to know about it.
{452}
Rem. "That the world may know that ... thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me".
C.A.C. The world is to know it.
God's people as a whole are very weak as to redemption, and that lies at the bottom of the secret of a great deal of departure.
Ques. Will you say what redemption is?
C.A.C. Well, that God has undertaken at His own cost to secure His people for Himself in a way suitable to Himself, in a way in which there is no flaw nor defect. He brought them out of the "house of bondage" by the death of Christ.
Redemption is an accomplished reality; God has taken His people out of the world by the blood of Christ for Himself.
And there is no flaw in redemption and no flaw in the results of it. So in Romans the apostle dwells on certain divine facts, really the fruit of redemption; and we have to accept those facts.
Rem. @Hebrews 9: 12 speaks of Christ "having found an eternal redemption", in a general sense.
C.A.C. Yes, it is redemption in itself, the actual thing in itself. All God's dealings with a lost world must be on the ground of redemption. God undertakes to secure things, to secure His people for Himself on the ground of redemption.
Rem. Redemption is for God and salvation for us, as you sometimes say.
C.A.C. Yes, I think it is true, and certain great fruits result. Look at @1 Corinthians 1: 30, 31 as an illustration of it. "But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who has been made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and holiness, and redemption; that according as it is written, He that boasts, let him boast in the Lord", that is God, "Lord" being the word used for Jehovah. So even of the saints in Corinth (and they were far from being right) he makes this statement without any qualification. It does not at all alter the fact that they were in Christ Jesus, "who has been made unto us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and holiness, and redemption", and the work of God in the souls of saints progresses
{453}
on that ground, because there is no flaw to it. Well, all eternity will not add one jot or tittle to redemption. After I have spent ages in eternity, it will not have less value then than now. It is just as great for one of us as for Paul or John.
He goes over it. It is a thing we have to accept and learn, that God has taken us out of the world and bondage, and put us in His own power and grace in Christ -- it is the fruit of redemption. And all the blessings we have must be the fruit of redemption, and if I have anything that is not the fruit of redemption, the sooner I throw it away the better; it is rubbish. To get hold of that gives a great sense of liberty with God, and it makes the thoughts of God extremely valuable to us. We are apt to slip away from the thought of redemption and then we get feeble and dissatisfied with God, as if somehow He had failed to do His best for us. All murmuring and complaining comes from a lack of the knowledge of redemption.
Ques. Why is it put, "house of bondage"?
C.A.C. I suppose in contrast to His own house; God's house is a house of liberty.
Rem. "Let my son go, that he may serve me".
C.A.C. Liberty is really the fruit of redemption and it is liberty really to be for God, they had not to think for a minute of anything else. As a redeemed people that is all we have to think of, to serve the One who has set us up in Christ and given us the Spirit.
In redemption we have the complete thing, though in one sense we do not have it complete till we get our glorified bodies, the result of redemption. It has helped me to see that the fruit of redemption must be complete, and if Christians are unsatisfied and complaining there is some defect in their knowledge of redemption. So it is important to understand where redemption has put us -- in Christ Jesus. It is all in God's anointed Man -- not a single bit is attached to me, but it is attached to Christ, and I get it in Christ. It is a most satisfying thing. I come into things as in Christ, knowing that not one attaches to me, but I get them all in Christ.
{454}
God effects redemption and then He provides leadership, and the leadership is perfect -- "Moses, Aaron, and Miriam", that is the character of the leadership. They could not really complain of that. You see, the mediator was very near to God, so that there was the effulgence of God in his face, so he was well qualified to give the people a divine lead at every point in the wilderness. And God has provided us with a true Mediator who is perfectly acquainted with God and with His mind, so if I go wrong it is by neglecting the perfect leadership provided.
Rem. @Hebrews 3: 1, "Consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus" (cf. Moses and Aaron).
C.A.C. Under the lordship of Christ we are instructed in all the mind of God. I Corinthians is wonderful in instructing us in that; and the leadership is as perfect as the redemption. We should not perhaps quite have thought of Aaron leading. He leads in a priestly way. He was a wonderful priest to represent every Israelite in the sanctuary -- all his infirmities would make him glad of the priest. Moses lays down the law, 'You must do it, however you feel'; Aaron says, 'You are a poor weak people, I must support you'. The two sides go on and the two thoughts are never separated, the provision in the priest for the weakness of the people, and all the blessed things of God. We need the priest whenever we come together for the service of God. He knows when we feel poorly, and when we get there the priest comes in to support us. We shall not want any priest in heaven, the priest always suggests some kind of infirmity in those that approach. There is leading in that -- everything to encourage us. It is a strange controversy.
Miriam gives a lead, and she represents the feminine subjective side; she could sing. The hymn book represents Miriam to us. It is a good thing to get a hymn that is purified, because a wrong hymn gives a wrong lead.
Now, God says, have you any complaint about redemption? Where did Moses lead you wrong? God is raising that
{455}
question with us, Have you anything to complain of? Then at the very end of the wilderness when you would think they had behaved so badly that God might have thrown them overboard -- 'You have been stiffnecked since I knew you', Moses said. God said, 'You are justified and set up in spiritual beauty', and He says, 'That is my righteousness'. We should have said, 'mercy' -- no! it is the righteousness of Jehovah; that is, God has the last word. And God will place His people in all this value of redemption eternally. Israel got away from everything God cherished in His heart for them, but God did not get away, and He reminded them of it.
Ques. Why is it Gilgal and not in the land? (verse 5).
C.A.C. He only goes as far as Gilgal. He only contemplates His people in the wilderness, only looks at them in the wilderness as chosen in Christ, as redeemed, and having the Spirit, because they had come to the brazen serpent and the springing well, and even when we have exposed all we are, God says, 'That has not altered My thoughts one bit'. This encourages holiness. The more I see God's thoughts about me, the more I feel I must be a separate, holy man. 'It might make me careless', you say. It never does. God has a righteous ground on which all these things are true, so Paul at the end of his course says, 'I am looking to be found in Him, not looking to have my righteousness but the righteousness of God through faith'. He was looking to be found in a righteousness in which there was no vestige of himself at all; Paul was looking for it. If we drop down from these thoughts, what we come to is something that is of the miserableness of man. The saints will be found in the grace of Another, the fruits of the righteousness of God. "Him who knew not sin he has made sin for us, that we might become God's righteousness in him" (@2 Corinthians 5: 21). That is the full result in glory, so these things are not elementary things, because redemption takes in the whole glorified condition; and what goes into that scene of glory is what is in Christ, nothing else goes in.
{456}
Ques. Is it not entered into now?
C.A.C. It is being reached, God's ministry of the word is leading to bring us all into it. How few believers know they are in Christ. They know their sins put away, that God is good and favourable to them, will comfort them in sorrow, help them in difficulty and presently bring them to heaven, but people may have all that without knowing they are in Christ. You cannot say anything better of any saint than that he is in Christ; when you have said that you have said everything. So when that is taken in, it is impossible to think of doing anything or giving anything to improve our state with God. Nothing in earth or heaven could possibly improve it. Legality centres in self, grace centres in Christ.
All God wants is three things, "To do justly, and to love goodness, and to walk humbly with thy God". It is the summing up of the whole fruit of grace seen practically in these things. It makes the christian life very simple, does it not? -- to do justly and love goodness and then walk humbly with thy God. I have nothing else to do but that, and it is perfect happiness; and nothing can hinder me from doing what is right except my own will, so it is just as well to discard the element that hinders.
We could easily have a dozen readings on these verses and then we should not get all out of them. We have to put all these things together, redemption, the leaders and every challenge on the part of God's elect answered. 'Those', God says, 'are My thoughts'. Then as to practical life we are to do what is right, to love goodness and walk humbly with our God. It all applies just as much to us as ever it did to Israel.
Rem. Offerings are mentioned with a sense that they do not add to the redemption of God's people one bit.
C.A.C. From the point of view of this chapter He does not want them. They do not improve a man's relations with God.
{457}
NOTES OF A READING
@Micah 7: 7 - 20
C.A.C. Last week we saw how Jehovah reminded His backsliding people of His ways of grace with them and that He looked for fruit, for them to take up this doing justly and loving goodness and walking humbly with their God. If grace does not bring forth this fruit, His chastening rod comes into action and the people have to suffer under His government for their grievous departure. In chapter 7 the prophet becomes the representative of the remnant that Jehovah would secure for Himself and whose sin and iniquity He would pardon and on whose behalf He would carry out His promises. In this chapter we get the exercises of the godly remnant and the deliverance in which they result.
Ques. Is that why "there is no cluster to eat" in verse 1? The collective thought has broken down?
C.A.C. Yes, the prophet has to feel the terrible state of the people of God (amongst whom he served) and that is a great exercise for those who have faith and fear God, to see so much evil among God's people. It is an exercise that has a very large place in Scripture; the Psalms are full of it. The great subject of the Psalms is the exercise of God's saints as being in the midst of terrible evil amongst God's people -- not the world generally speaking. Well, that exercise is always present with us -- if all is evil -- that is, with those that fear God. Quite as terrible things are said of Christians in the New Testament as were ever said in the Old. Paul has to say of Christians, "All seek their own things, not the things of Jesus Christ" (@Philippians 2: 21), and he says many Christians walk, "of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ" (@Philippians 3: 4) -- that is *Christians*.
Ques. Why of the cross of Christ?
{458}
C.A.C. Because that is what they hated.
Rem. It is a more or less individual path.
C.A.C. That is the key to the portion -- the terrible things among God's people have the effect of isolating those who fear Him. If we do not know much about what it is to be isolated we shall not know much about what it is to be gathered. This exercise that isolates the prophet is what qualifies him to be a gathering centre. So it is in Timothy; we are to take note of all the terrible things marking Christians, not the heathen world. "Having a form of piety but denying the power of it". It isolated Moses; this individual exercise is most important. If we fear God we shall feel wrong among His people; we shall be isolated and completely shut up to God; that is what we began with -- verse 7. The prophet has got to a point that he cannot trust anybody. I think it was a right exercise with Elijah, and God comforted him, "I have left myself seven thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed unto Baal". It says here he cannot trust the one that lies in his bosom. At that point God says, 'Can you trust Me?' I can.
Rem. "I commit you to God, and to the word of his grace", Paul said to the elders in @Acts 20.
C.A.C. I think Paul did it in the confession that there was nothing to trust but God and the word of His grace. Well, that will carry us through. There will be people patterned after the prophet. He was sanctified through his very distress. It is intended to sanctify us, and that is how others are sanctified; it may be a few only; and the walls being built is an assembly thought. According to that verse it is an individual exercise and he feels there is nothing for it but Jehovah, He is the only One to be trusted.
Rem. On the day the walls are built it says the established limit will recede.
C.A.C. Of course it will. It means enlargement; if the limits recede there is more room.
There is something very much worse than the conduct of the people of God -- this female enemy. (See note in Darby Translation to verses 8, 10.) It transpires in our day.
{459}
Ques. Is it a false system?
C.A.C. I thought so, worse than bad conduct. To have a system opposed to what is of God is far worse than bad conduct. There is a false woman, a system called the great harlot and in deadly opposition to what is of God. The enemy referred to here specifically is the apostate Jews that will seek the favour of antichrist, the fierce enemy of those who fear God. Coming to the king with ointments and rings she makes herself as attractive as possible to the antichrist. The remnant of Jews will be permeated by this system -- something like the synagogue of Satan -- a system that is really satanic, marked by what is traditional and ceremonial, so in Revelation we find she is drunk with the blood of the saints and will not have what is of God. We are surrounded in christendom by a system that is built up on a refusal of grace and truth where the natural man is given place and there is persecution of those who are godly. But this wickedness is only building up what is of God in the prophet, it only sanctifies the people. And he is brought to see himself in the true light. It is like passing from @Isaiah 5 to @Isaiah 6. In chapter 5, "Woe unto them", but in chapter 6, "Woe is me". It has an effect like that on the prophet (verses 8, 9); that is, he is going through the exercise himself, for he is a poor failing thing himself. And Daniel had to find that all his comeliness turned into ashes. So here without God Himself Micah would never have arisen. He has nothing to plead in verse 9. That is going down to the bottom -- then he comes into the light. He is conscious of being under the indignation of Jehovah for his own sin. Faith always counts upon God taking up our cause. "I will bear the indignation of Jehovah -- for I have sinned against him -- until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light; I shall behold his righteousness". It is perfectly delightful. Every man convicted of sin counts on God taking up his cause. He goes home and gets on his knees; that is, he counts on God helping him. It ought to encourage us to be very ready to go down, for we can count on God. It is a very blessed thing that
{460}
attraction to God always goes along with conviction of sin -- like it did with Peter. And then we learn God's righteousness. Seeing God's righteousness is far better than having one of my own. Properly speaking, a Christian is never sitting in darkness; this is the way the soul comes to the realised blessedness that we had in the previous chapter -- God's way of righteousness made known in grace to an utterly unworthy people. Those who have to do with God will see the destruction of Babylon, and it is as seeing the destruction of Babylon that we really come to the city of God; it is after her overthrow that we come to new Jerusalem. We must see it as a destroyed thing before we can get any right apprehension of God's things. It is very striking to see the setting of all this, the judgment of the opposing system and the walls set up of a system for God, and there is a gathering point and they come from all quarters.
Ques. Has it a present application -- Babylon fallen?
C.A.C. Yes, I think the one precedes the other. We see that all of man marked by human glory is coming down, and then we turn to contemplate the divine thought and that the building of the walls has begun. Those in the remnant position are spoken of as "dwelling alone in the forest"; they are not in Jerusalem yet, but they rally to the exercises of the prophet and are there to be fed.
There is a centre of gathering that comes into evidence in that way, and Jehovah takes them on and feeds them and undertakes to do everything for them as in the days of their coming forth out of Egypt. He had to do it all Himself, and He is doing it all Himself now. We have little idea of the pleasure God has in feeding those cast upon Himself and who confess they have no righteousness but Himself, and He does wonders for them. It is to be noted what is presented here; it is not about the house or the city or the millennium, but the blessedness of knowing Him as a God of forgiveness; that is, to be brought to God -- that is the greatest of all, God known in forgiveness. There is only one place where you can find forgiveness, I am certain of it -- and I repeat it with
{461}
emphasis. Where must forgiveness be? It could only be in one place, it must be in the heart of the One offended against. In natural things only the one who has been wronged can forgive, and forgiveness is in the heart, not in the head. Forgiveness can only be found in the heart of God. The only footing sinful creatures can be on with God is forgiveness. What we think to be humility is often unbelief and, at the bottom, pride. It is a climax here, and I do not think that till today I understood the blessedness of it. You would think the kingdom would be spoken of, but no, Micah speaks of what it is to be brought to God known in forgiveness, of a people morally brought near to a forgiving God who delights in loving-kindness. So the assembly is really the home of forgiveness because God is known in the character of forgiveness, and nobody can take from me the privilege of forgiving.
Rem. Forgiveness is really the basis of love.
C.A.C. I am sure of that. We find it much easier to believe that God would forgive us before conversion than after. The administration of it depends on our confessing, but the forgiveness was there from the first. It is our privilege to forgive before the person says one word of regret. It may have to wait, you may not be able to say it. It is the state of my own heart I have to think of. If my heart is not corresponding with God's heart I am far from Him. It is my privilege to take on God's character; it is the highest of all ground, it has impressed me very much today. Nobody can approach God, having anything in his heart against anybody. We all need to be imbued with this spirit. I am the person that suffers if I hold a feeling against anybody, and the thing is to eliminate all suffering from my heart. It is like the year of release, it is a privilege for the creditor. Otherwise we do not uphold the spirit of the dispensation. Christians are often in darkness because they cannot forgive. If they cannot forgive they are not like God.
The climax of it all is that we come to God known in forgiveness, and there is only one thing necessary to add; if we are brought to God in forgiveness the ground is cleared for
{462}
God to fulfil all His promises and all His purposes. It is fine! It is the comfort of those suffering under the enemy's power and God having dealt with it could act in grace to Assyria. So Assyria is going to be blessed with Egypt in the world to come along with Israel. There is a popular prophecy that Nineveh will be rebuilt and that the Lord will not come till after that -- it is all putting off the Lord's coming. But it is very striking that when the thing is judged in its head and centre, He can then act in grace and bring blessing to the country.
God is going to make an end of Babylon and Assyria. After that He will produce a new Assyria, as He will produce a new Israel and a new Egypt, and will do it on the basis of the death of Christ and of the redemption that is in His own mind. There are two great powers acting in Europe today. My own impression is the devil is trying to hurry up things in Europe before the time (he is trying for imperialism); therefore he will be checked. Perhaps in a short time they will succeed.

READINGS ON HABAKKUK
{464}
{465}
SUBSTANCE OF A READING
@Habakkuk 1: 1 - 17; @Habakkuk 2: 1
Habakkuk is particularly a record of the exercises of faith in a time of great trial, and the result of these exercises in blessing and joy before any obtained deliverance -- that is the book of Habakkuk in one word.
I think the book has a particular bearing on us today. No one can say it is not a time of peculiar trial.
The object God had in view in disappointing the prophet (verses 1 - 4) was that he might engage himself with what God was doing (see verse 5). It is God's answer to his exercise. Though it looked outwardly as if God were doing nothing, He was doing something and He wanted faith to be occupied with what He was doing and to marvel at it. God is never quiescent. At present (1943) He has brought a great scourge upon Europe, but it is really for the correction of His people, it is for their good (verses 6 - 11). Instead of the prophet being overwhelmed and quaking he is just turned to God. He says, "Art thou not from everlasting, Jehovah my God, my Holy One?" It leads Him to take personal possession of God. And that is really what God would bring us to at the present time.
In quiet times we are apt to forget Him.
Those who fear Him and honour Him will never be objects of His anger; He will always be for them. Looking at the Chaldeans, he might say, 'We shall die', but looking at God -- the eternal God -- faith says, "We shall not die". To come to the reality of God is a great thing, and the trials and testings of the present time are all to bring us to that. Faith is assured that if any trial or pressure comes, it is for the good of God's people; it is impossible that it should be anything else.
{466}
Yet the prophet's apprehension of God's holiness adds to his exercise and makes things more difficult. How can such a God let things pass? So faith has its puzzles and difficulties. This is an exercise of faith. But faith always comes to the conclusion that if there is a puzzle, God has something special to say to me in it -- in connection with that very thing. These are exercises of faith, not of unbelief.
The proper reaction to this is, I am to watch, I am to listen, God has something to say to me in this. It is a fine thing to know there is always a tower you can get up into and hear something you never heard before. When God is correcting His people it intimates there is always something in us needful for correction. "What shall I answer?" That is, he is under reproof and what is the thing to answer? God expects His people to understand and answer intelligently. On the tower he leaves all below and turns to hear what God has to say to him. God has something of reproof to say to Habakkuk, and he says, I want to know how to answer it. At a time like this there is a general call to His faithful people to get up on the tower and consider, each one for himself and herself, What does this mean? And when we get light from God we know how to answer. The psalmist says, "Before I was afflicted, I went astray"; and again, "It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I might learn thy statutes" (@Psalm 119: 67, 71). I do not see what the good of trouble is to anyone if we do not learn something; we might as well not have it.
And we come to the secret of God's mind. Habakkuk had the great secret that lies at the base of everything. Take a tablet and write the vision that he that runs may read it-that is, the great secret underlying all Scripture. For God has a perfect answer to every problem that rises in the world or in the hearts of His people, and He is going to bring it all to light at the coming of the Lord. It is remarkable that when the Spirit of God quotes verse 3 in @Hebrews 10: 37, He changes "it" to "he". It is "it" to the prophet, but it is "he" to the apostles, that is, He connects it all with a Person. None of us would think of saying, 'If the Lord tarry'. The Lord
{467}
would never wish that we should put off His coming. It is wholly wrong for a Christian. But it was right for the prophet to say "tarry", for there were 70 weeks to come. A Christian knows He will not.
NOTES OF A READING
@Habakkuk 2: 1 - 4, 14, 20; @Habakkuk 3: 1 - 6
C.A.C. We have seen how the prophet instructed by God was shown the end of God's ways, that had to be waited for, and was also shown what would be the power of life in the saints in the meantime; that is, there was going to be a kind of waiting time -- the deliverance was sure to come -- during which the just should live by his faith; and that time is still running on.
Redemption has been accomplished in Christ, but there is no outward deliverance, things are going on as before. Deliverance has not yet come in publicly. "The just shall live by his faith", (three times repeated in Scripture) is very important. Here it connects with @Galatians 3: 11 very distinctly. Under the law people lived by doing things; it is not the way of life now, indeed it never was. The divine system is only realisable by faith, there is nothing outwardly to show that Christ has effected anything.
Ques. Why is it faith and not the Spirit here?
C.A.C. This very scripture in Galatians tells us it is through faith we receive the Spirit (verse 14). That is the great gain of faith now, and it is by faith and the Spirit that we live. So if we move outside faith and the Spirit, all is death for us; hence it is very important to keep in the sphere of faith; that is, in the region of the things that cannot be seen.
Rem. The Lord said to Thomas, "Blessed they who have not seen and have believed".
{468}
C.A.C. And Christ is only known by faith, that is quite certain. He is hidden from the eyes of men, and the saints are all waiting for the moment when He comes, and have nothing until then but what they have in faith and by the Spirit.
Rem. "Whom, having not seen, ye love" (@1 Peter 1: 8), and the rejoicing is in that line too.
C.A.C. It is a wonderful thing that people can be supremely happy in connection with an unseen Person, and He is more to them than all the circumstances here, whether pleasing or distressing. Peter addresses the saints, not only as believing, but as having their portion. There is nothing you can show; you cannot show your faith but by your works. The faith system will go on as long as the assembly is here, and will go on for the remnant while they are waiting for Christ.
Ques. Until verse 14 is fulfilled?
C.A.C. It is remarkable how the Spirit of God drops that verse down into the middle of the description of the surrounding confusion and violence. It is faith's objective; faith always held that the earth belongs to God, and He must have it. Therefore there is nothing so foolish as the nations quarrelling about the possession of the earth. Faith rejoices in the thought of Christ taking up His rights.
Rem. "I will overturn, overturn, overturn it ... until he come whose right it is; and I will give it to him" (@Ezekiel 21: 27).
C.A.C. It is the subject of the prophetic word and the great objective, that He is going to take up His rights to have the earth. It is not difficult to see; God has spoken in more than three hundred passages of the coming of His Son. "Jehovah is in his holy temple"; that is, Jehovah retires from the earth, and that is where faith sees Him; and in chapter 3 faith follows Him into His holy temple and we are told what faith sees there. So Habakkuk comes into all that can be seen in the holy temple. 'In the holy shrine enquiring', as we sing. He knows no other place of light except the temple, and
{469}
those who want it can go there. Jehovah retires, He does not contend with men for the earth at the moment, because He is working out much greater designs. He has got heaven in view as well as the earth and at the same time calls on all the earth to be silent before Him, to hear what He has to say-because to "be silent" means you are going to listen to Him. I hear such a lot of talk about prayer in this war, and nothing like calling on people to listen to what God has to say. God is saying wonderful things at the present time.
Ques. What place has Habakkuk's prayer in relation to the vision?
C.A.C. Every place, because the vision was to show that all that is of God is coming in, but you have to wait for it. This is the waiting time.
Ques. We should not say, 'If He tarry'?
C.A.C. The Lord likes us to take Him at His word, and He says, "Quickly".
Rem. It is very cheering.
C.A.C. It is the Person that is to be looked for; it is a Person who is coming in a very little while. But Habakkuk, it seems to me, follows Jehovah into His holy temple, and his prayer brings out what can be known by those who go into it.
He says, "Jehovah, I heard the report of thee, and I feared. Jehovah, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make it known: in wrath remember mercy!" That is, he begins with the sense that God was acting in wrath in connection with the wickedness of His people, so he begins in a spirit of fear (verse 2). But in the presence of that He appeals for a revival of God's work, and that in the midst of wrath He would remember mercy. It is beautiful to see him counting on God's mercy in presence of the people's failure and wrong-doing. And this prayer is a wonderful unfolding of what God does for His people, taking no account of the failure of the people. After speaking of it in recognition of the need for repentance, it makes no reference to it.
{470}
We cannot get away from the fact that there is a distressing state among the people of God. What is to be done? Well, God must revive His work; it is what we all want. I am sure I want Him to revive His work in my soul. It is blessed to see how revival comes about. Habakkuk's prayer shows largely how it does, that is by paying attention to God's original ways of blessing to His people -- by going back to the beginning of God's ways. We are in a very extraordinary time. God has moved in our day in the most wonderful way that it was possible to move in relation to the truth that was from the beginning. He will never do again such things as He has done. It is for all saints now to be in the light of what God has done; and that is the only way back to revival. It is not what He will do, but what He has done. See verses 3 and 4, "His glory covereth the heavens, And the earth is full of his praise. And his brightness was as the light; Rays came forth from his hand; And there was the hiding of his power". The Holy Spirit of God in penning these lines was thinking of the incarnation of the blessed Son of God, and all that would be accomplished by that marvellous act of divine love. And revival is to get back to that. We are entitled in the temple to forget everything but what God has done. There is a reference here to @Deuteronomy 33: 1, 2. There is the same thought of revival there, because it brings out what cannot be undone, that which no power of evil can undo.
That was only a typical deliverance for Israel, but we are come to the reality. We have moved out, as in verse 13 it says, "Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people". That is what God had in view in sending His Son into the world; He had heaven and earth in view. It looked as if He were operating only in a tiny sphere, a small part of the earth, but tremendous things were being done, and heaven and earth are going to be filled with the operations of God through the incarnation of His Son. The whole earth is going to be in reconciliation, and to faith it is all done, it has taken place. Scripture is full of instances of where you get the full
{471}
result for faith, and yet you cannot see anything of it. Take for instance the angels praise in @Luke 2. There was only a little Babe to be seen, and yet the angels could say, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good pleasure in men". And so in @Exodus 15, every enemy was seen defeated, faith celebrated it all as a present reality. That is what we get in the temple; he sees heaven and earth full of glory; and he did not see a thousandth part of what we see.
And this chapter is full of what God had done for His people, it is a description of how He had delivered them. It is a practical picture in sublime language, yet all typical, but we are to come to the reality. It is all put down for our comfort and joy, that we might come into the temple and view it. It is what has shone out in the only-begotten Son; the glory and praise of God have shone out in that blessed One. It is not possible through all eternity to make any addition to what came out in Him as a blessed Man on earth. And God is going to fill heaven and earth with it, with what God had revealed in His Son as Man on earth. "For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah as the waters cover the sea". What a wonderful earth it will be, too, when everyone you meet will have something to say about Christ!
Ques. Why is "knowledge" added here and not in @Isaiah 11:9?
C.A.C. The one is objective (the glory of Jehovah) and the other is subjective (the knowledge of Jehovah), it is in the hearts of men.
Ques. 'There only to adore' (J.N.D.), would that express it?
C.A.C. Yes. Well, how we should dwell on the gospels. I feel we do not dwell on the gospels adoringly in private. There is a misfortune in our very familiarity with Scripture; it takes away from the blessedness of what is presented. The gospels are the most difficult part of all Scripture to fathom, they are of unfathomable depth, yet it is there for us to go in
{472}
for. Certain things are most surely believed among us. And Theophilus was written to that he should know "the certainty of those things in which thou hast been instructed".
Rem. We know something of the first veil, but not much of passing through the second veil.
C.A.C. Yes, there were five pillars to the first entrance and four to the second. It is like the epistles and gospels.
In verse 4, "his brightness was as the light; Rays came forth from his hand". What a shining out of divine power in the way of grace (see note, 'horns') in the hand of Jesus, divine power acting in grace to men, and then the full light of God there. It can never be added to through all eternity.
Luke repeatedly speaks of His hands, speaks of the seven actions of His hands, and yet it is one of those mysteries of Scripture brought out in Habakkuk.
"And there was the hiding of his power". You would not have expected that; yet the rays were all hidden, it says so.
Was it not all hidden from the scribes and Pharisees; Herod and Pilate? It was power acting in a hidden way. What is the cross but the hiding of power? There is nothing weaker than a man on a cross. The Lord said, 'My Father could send me more than twelve legions of angels'. That is the mystery of things, there is hidden power, and only the saints know how to value it. It is for the saints to be hidden now; that is the place for them just as much as for the Lord.
There is a solemn side to all this suggested in verses 5 and 6; that is, the perfect shining out of God in His blessed Son was the condemnation of those that did not believe; that is what is suggested here. As the Lord says distinctly Himself, "This is the judgment, that light is come into the world, and men have loved darkness rather than light; for their works were evil". And again, "He that believes not has been already judged" (@John 3: 19, 18); there is no need to wait till the judgment day, he is judged already. That he does not believe on God revealed in love in Jesus, that very fact is his condemnation.
{473}
And so the "hills" and "mountains" that are overturned (verse 6) represent all that is most mighty on the earth. They are all overturned, not publicly but for faith; that is man's religion, after the rejection and crucifixion of Christ; and so too as to learning and philosophy and power. The world power signed the death warrant of Jesus. The saints have no regard morally for what is great in the world, and the world powers are represented as beasts, unintelligent powers.
"The eternal mountains were scattered, The everlasting hills gave way: His ways are everlasting". We come to the point that the eternal mountains and the everlasting hills are all overturned for those who believe that Jesus is the Christ. But then His ways are everlasting, are from eternity to eternity; and whether war or peace, one thing stands and that is, God's ways. Everything is overturned for faith. Judaism is overturned for faith; christendom today is only judaism with christian terms imported into it; it is nothing else.

READING ON HAGGAI
{476}
{477}
NOTES OF A READING
@Haggai 2: 1 - 23
C.A.C. "Who is left among you that saw this house in its former glory? and how do ye see it now? Is it not as nothing in your eyes?" (verse 3). This was a subtle discouragement because it minimised the work of God by recalling the former glory of the house. If we look at things with the natural eye we get away from God. Three weeks after recommencing they had been discouraged from within. There is the danger not to see what God is reviving. We bring all that is collected formerly into the present. It is the same house. God has in no wise departed from His original thought and in no wise diminished it. If two stones are there they can be placed together in the glory of God's house. God's thoughts are no less than in Solomon's time.
What are we recovered to? It is to the glory of the house. It is a glorious house, and God's thought is increased glory. This we need to have before us in all our prayers, meetings, etc. We want to bring more glory into the house. The widow woman cast all into the treasury of the house and Christ added to that widow's heart all the glory of the original house, though it was in the hands of evil men.
God had not departed from His covenant which He made when they came out of Egypt. "Ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation". 'My word remains among you', God tells them, and the word concerning the house remains among us -- every word remains. It is still in the heart of God and in the word. "The word ..., and my Spirit, remain among you: fear ye not". God says, 'I have not gone away from it, in company with the Spirit'.
{478}
Rem. So the "shaking" takes place to bring God's thought of the house to completion.
C.A.C. Yes, God is shaking everything to get material for the house. He shakes the nations to get everything that is precious amongst them for material for the house. That is how they are thinking about it in heaven, I am quite certain. God is working so that Christ may become the signet in His hand for impression upon all. I do not think it will stop for a minute till Christ comes, so that the impress of God may be upon everything. "The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith Jehovah of hosts". He claims everything that is of value in this world for Himself. 'I will not leave a bit of it out, I want all of it for My house'. The preciousness is all with the saints. "The desire of all nations", of course, is Christ. We want to get into the secret of God's mind. The work of God makes Christ precious in hearts, so that He has become the Object of desire. Well, every bit of that is wanted for His house. We ought to understand these things. It was for the remnant. Either we are going on with glory, or with uncleanness, every one of us -- there is nothing between the two. "I am with you, saith Jehovah of hosts". It is the only power. If God is not with us, we have none.
Rem. What place has peace (verse 9)?
C.A.C. It looks on to the full millennial result, but in principle these conditions will be sure to bring in peace. Then He loves to be with His people immediately they turn their attention towards what is before Him. That is what we want above everything else -- God dwelling with us. That is why God took them out of Egypt -- the world.
Rem. It clearly suggests these are our closing moments and if we lose this, we lose it altogether.
C.A.C. The impress of glory should be on our prayers and everything. God's thought is that we should move on from glory to glory. See how the glory has increased in the lifetime of some of us. Each one of us should contribute glory. So we should earnestly cultivate every apprehension of Christ that we get.
{479}
Rem. "But we all, looking on the glory of the Lord, with unveiled face, are transformed according to the same image from glory to glory".
C.A.C. Yes, that is how the glory comes into the house. So we want to get away from all that is formal and stereotyped in the house of God. We should all make room and time for individual exercise in the knowledge of Christ, and then it comes into the house.
Rem. In @Romans 8, as having the spirit we are glorified.
C.A.C. All this comes into our range (@Haggai 2) showing how the word of God is living. It is more for us than for them. It was written for us and not for them. Silver and gold are what the saints are as redeemed and as in new creation -- all claimed for the house. God's chief interest is in the valuables in the world, and He has given us light to see what He is after.
Then the next prophetic word is a warning that we may take on features of uncleanness in contrast to glory. There is nothing but that outside the realm of glory. The Christian profession is unclean in the sight of God. There never was more boastfulness there in a certain way, but then where are the precious things, the oil, wine, pomegranate, etc? "Buy", the things are to be had if you want them.
Rem. "Buy the truth and sell it not".
C.A.C. These two sections are most important to us here in T. -- there is the ever-increasing glory, and if we deviate from that we shall fall into uncleanness. It is easier for defilement to be transmitted than holiness, which is a serious consideration. We should maintain strict separation from the uncleanness in Christendom. "Touch not what is unclean", Paul says (@2 Corinthians 6: 17).
The final word is really addressed to Christ. Here it comes twice in one day. There is a fresh start -- "From this day will I bless you", showing that God takes account of the very day when there is a movement towards Him and His house. As long as our concerns are before us, we are under a curse -- but then, "From this day will I bless you" (verse 19).
{480}
Rem. He sets Himself to bless at once.
C.A.C. There had been several fresh moves and they subsided. This is about the fourth move, but He takes account of it and says, "From this day will I bless you". No assembly can be beyond the state of the individuals in it.
There will be fruitfulness in the blessing instead of no joy in the heart. How many saints in T. know what that is? If we are not supremely happy we ought to ask the reason, search out the reason why perhaps there are not fifty but twenty measures, and consider the perfect fairness of God's ways with us. The sooner we get at the reason the better. "Consider" is really, 'Set your heart on it'. The closing prophetic word shows God's great thought of putting the impress of Christ on everything, for Zerubbabel is evidently a type of Christ. God's thought is that every human being should carry the impress of Christ. Tribulation days will be tremendous shaking, our days are only a shadow of it. Personal discipline in shaking is to make room for Christ. God would not take away anything from us without giving something better. How could any man regret losing everything, if he had more of Christ instead? Paul gave up voluntarily, so did not want discipline on that line.
Rem. "And his name is on their foreheads" (@Revelation 22: 4).
{481}
READINGS ON ZECHARIAH
{482}
{483}
NOTES OF A READING
@Zechariah 1: 1 - 21
C.A.C. From Ezra we see that Haggai and Zechariah helped the people in their work; and the people prospered under their ministry (@Ezra 6: 14). There is health and prosperity if we know how to avail ourselves of what is written.
Rem. Exact dates are given here showing things are worked out in an ordered way.
C.A.C. In Zechariah we get much more of the activity of divine Persons than in the other two post-captivity prophets. This is why Jehovah of hosts is so often mentioned -- forty-eight times -- and the Angel of Jehovah, and great prominence given to the Spirit (chapter 4). They are acting in remnant times, and no doubt the Spirit of God wrote this book particularly for us. We find from the book of Ezra that the house took only four years to finish after the prophetic ministry, so we too should get on under it in our day.
In the historical books, kings of Persia are prominent and all hangs on them, but with prophetic books God's people go on entirely independent of political powers and they are not mentioned. I thought it was to steady the people.
Ques. Is it to show there is no exercise any time but what the prophetic word can meet it?
C.A.C. Yes, and that we are independent of the powers and governments of the world. They are relegated to the back of the picture.
The first word given to Zechariah called attention to the former prophets and that all they said had come to pass. That prophecy was needed, and showed they were under judgment for departure. One principal condition of our spiritual advance is our taking heed to our prophetic ministry today -- I mean in the word as to what is happening in christendom.
{484}
Rem. We get it in @Acts 20 and @Revelation 3?
C.A.C. Yes, and in Peter, Jude, Timothy, etc. Are we ready to give heed to this prophetic ministry? These are all our own prophets who tell us what would transpire in the present day, and it has exactly come to pass.
Rem. @Hebrews 11 speaks of "Samuel, and of the prophets". The prophetic line must continue, and it shows departure from God's original thought.
C.A.C. Yes, and in spite of all that we find divine Persons taking things in hand for Their own pleasure.
Rem. How does @1 Corinthians 14 agree with what you say about failure?
C.A.C. Does not prophecy in the assembly take on a positive character? God has always presented along with failure what is of Himself. The prophecy would not be complete without it. @Romans 16 gives the positive side too, and Zechariah is full of what is positive, because it presents divine Persons. They are going to do wonderful things.
@Romans 11: 20 - 22 shows that if we do not value our privileges, we shall be cut off. The Christian profession is about to be cut off, and I do not think we shall get much light from God if we do not recognise that. Prophecy is a call to return. I think we have to reach that in our own souls -- the departure and ruin, and that there is nothing left to us but what divine Persons can do for us. We are disillusioned as to Christendom, finding everything is hopeless there. We cease from man whose breath is in his nostrils. Divine Persons are just what They were at the beginning. Instead of wasting time trying to rehabilitate things in Christendom, it is best to accept the ruin to start with. The basis of all true encouragement lies in accepting the complete ruin of man.
Rem. "I commit you to God, and to the word of his grace".
C.A.C. Beautiful. The myrtle-trees in the low valley are the remnant.
Rem. "Thou hast a little power".
C.A.C. The man on the red horse, I have no doubt, is
{485}
the Lord Jesus, the same as in verse 11, spoken of as the Angel of Jehovah, that is His representation in manhood. He is found among the myrtle-trees in the low valley -- as in Matthew. What encouragement for the feeble and faithful remnant to have Him among them.
Rem. I thought "red" was to give Him prominence as in the red heifer -- His uniqueness.
C.A.C. In Matthew all power in heaven and upon earth is given Him, but He is with His feeble people. The governments are behind the Man on the horse, so the Lord Jesus should stand out before the vision of our souls, in front of the powers that be. As here, so the Lord is in the midst of two or three gathered unto His name in the assembly gospel (@Matthew 18: 20). It is just as true in the day of departure as at the beginning. Myrtle speaks of those who have heard His call and come out in a meek and lowly character suited to the valley, in contrast to the pretension in Christendom. The myrtle is going to displace the thorn -- the haughtiness of the flesh. As regards the world the Lord will be found in the low valley -- not on the mountain top. The Lord is where His Spirit is found, He is not with anyone who has not His Spirit.
The movement of revival is in answer to the intercession of the Man on the horse (verse 12). It begins with the intercession of Christ. We shall not understand recovery unless we see this. It is not due to Cyrus, but a question entirely of mercy, because of such departure on the part of men. This applies to the movement over one hundred years ago. It is the answer to His precious intercession, or there would have been no such revival.
Rem. Seventy years -- God does put limit to things and we are to be hidden in His pavilion until the time of indignation is past. What of the horses, chapter 6 gives them more in detail?
C.A.C. The four empires of Daniel would be quite familiar to them. These are in a secondary position; it is the Man on the red horse who is prominent.
"All the earth at rest" would speak of great self-complacency in the religious world. It is a mark of displeasure to
{486}
God that people in the world take things so easily. They will not do anything.
The intercession is to restore God's great universal thoughts. You cannot have them in any sect or national body; they would blow it to pieces. The Church of England could not hold them -- poor little narrow thing. Yet, wonderful it is, God has made it possible to us -- little, almost contemptible people -- to appreciate His great universal thoughts!
It is beautiful to link together the intercession of Christ and recovery to His thoughts, so that the great original thoughts of God should come to pass. And everything is effected, "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit". So that 'Glory all belongs to God'.
NOTES OF A READING
@Zechariah 1: 12 - 21; @Zechariah 2: 1 - 13
C.A.C. As we have noticed, the restoration comes in answer to the intercession of Christ. God has returned to His people with mercies. The intercession of Christ has taken on a peculiar character during the last hundred years (verse 13). It is good to see that these words characterise the present moment -- "With good words, comforting words". They are spoken to Christ. God is comforting the heart of Christ. He is securing a comfort for Christ He has never had all through the church's history of unfaithfulness-now God is securing it in a feeble remnant at the end of the dispensation.
Rem. It makes the word to Philadelphia of great interest. New Jerusalem comes into view and the Lord keeps the door open that the testimony might go on to the end.
C.A.C. And these words were spoken to an unfaithful and discouraged people, occupied with their own matters. If
{487}
that does not magnify God's grace, I do not know what does. They came to put heart and backbone into the people to build, and are just as much God's word to us.
God has committed Himself to see this through. Now, have we committed ourselves to it? He looks for this. Whatever God establishes on earth never lapses in spite of all breakdown. God has never in one sense left His thoughts, but He returns to them with blessing for His people in view. "With mercies", He says. We are in a state of great weakness, just as they were in, as seen in chapter 3. They were filthy. Even the priesthood was filthy. He puts it in a condition pleasing to Him.
Rem. God works in His people to bring them into line first with His own thoughts.
C.A.C. There is a similar activity going on today. God always has His own forces to neutralise what hinders His work, so we must not expect help from the powers that be. The four gentile powers have always scattered. They scattered the Jews, crucified Christ, martyred the apostles and persecuted the church. Their tolerant character in this country is not their normal character. But there is a greater power to neutralise it.
These first two chapters are in the nature of divine proposals, and we need to keep to their character. There was nothing but ruins actually. But the carpenters have been at work all through the history of the church. That is, Paul's ministry was infinitely greater than all the power of the Caesars. The right church history we do not know, it is only written in heaven. The carpenters have been at work all through the Dark Ages to cast out the four horns of the Gentiles.
Rem. It is remarkable that the Lord should be a Carpenter. "How often would I have gathered thy children".
C.A.C. A carpenter puts things together in a firm way. Jerusalem is "built as a city that is compact together". There is more power in that than in all the armies and navies in the
{488}
world! Four would speak of universality. All true ministry is universal in its character-true everywhere.
Next a man is seen with a measuring line in his hand. Jerusalem is measured to show the whole thing in plan, and you must have God's plan first. Jerusalem is the final great thought; He looks on to the culmination. So God does today in the city. Construction is going on, and God looks that we all should be building. If I have before me what God has before Him, there is no doubt as to result.
We have to recognise that the plan has been lost for eighteen centuries. This man comes to give us an idea of the plan. He represents that acting of God by which the attention of saints has been turned to the characteristics of God's plan. Things would not bear measurement. God has awakened a desire to know God's measurements. Jerusalem represents God's universal thoughts, and when people see it, it makes such a difference; they get away from their own blessings, security and acceptance, to see what is common to all saints -- blessing "in Christ Jesus".
Daniel and Ezekiel had had the plan. It takes in "all saints" and if you left one saint out, you would spoil the plan. It is what God is out to construct in Christ Jesus, and it is marked by absolute unity. The saints are one body in Christ in Corinthians. The material is of such nature that it must be one, "in Christ Jesus".
Rem. In @Revelation 11 the temple and the altar are measured.
C.A.C. There was something there in spite of all the apostasy that can be measured -- so here in T. -- and something worth protecting. The court of the Gentiles was left unmeasured. It is a spiritual thought. I do not think there will be a material temple then.
"All Gods sons by faith in Christ Jesus" (@Galatians 3: 26) and "one in Christ Jesus" (@Galatians 3: 28) -- that is the plan. How can you possibly go back after that! Some give the lie to everything they profess on their banner by going back.
{489}
Ques. Why the haste in verse 4?
C.A.C. Zechariah was a young man -- the Timothy of his day, and it was urgent that he should be brought into the mind of God. The plan is first, but God is not content for it to remain a plan.
Rem. A plan is a means to an end.
C.A.C. God wants Jerusalem populated. It is as we live in Jerusalem that there is something to secure divine protection. It is very wholesome to remind ourselves of it. If we are dwelling in the divine thoughts in Christ there is something worth protection, and we shall surely have it. The empires of the world are like a handful of dust compared with the remnant that cherishes God's thoughts. What is found in return to God will be protected.
Rem. But only what is real, not artificial, with us.
C.A.C. That is what I had in mind. "I will keep you". The object of this book is to bring us into the enjoyment of these things -- enjoying the blessings in Christ Jesus. It is not anything special to a class, but common christianity -- the common portion for all saints in Christ, but many miss it by being where it cannot be known. There are thousands walking together in the fellowship of His Son. God does not want hermits.
If the saints are touched God is touched in the most sensitive part, the apple of the eye.
Ques. Could this refer to individual faithfulness in the same way?
C.A.C. There is no church testimony in one individual. You could not think of being in the midst of one. God cherishes what is collective. It is there where God is in the midst. If separated, we must hang on with tenacious grip to God's great universal thoughts and never give them up. I do not think God is going to suffer a collective enjoyment of things to be done away with. (Paul did not give them up in prison nor John in Patmos.) He suggests more than that -- "I ... will be the glory in the midst of her".
{490}
NOTES OF A READING
@Zechariah 3: 1 - 10
Ques. Why is it "After the glory" in chapter 2: 8?
C.A.C. After the glory God will judge Babylon -- morally, after God has brought in the original thoughts as to the assembly, judgment is inevitable. If God's thoughts come in and are established in His saints, that is glory in a moral sense, and everything contrary to it must be judged. See verse 13, "Let all flesh be silent before Jehovah: for he is risen up out of his holy habitation".
If God rises up to secure His pleasure in the remnant of His people (as He has in our own day), that involves the cleansing of all iniquity and setting up instead true characteristics of the holy priesthood -- very beautiful to think of.
Rem. "In his temple doth every one say, Glory". In the assembly the character is glory.
Rem. It is not here so much what the people get, but God is satisfying His own heart; it is that He might have His portion in His people.
C.A.C. Yes, and that depends on the place that Christ has with us. In the first two chapters God is presenting His thoughts in an abstract way. In actuality the ruin and the state of the priesthood were the exact opposite. But God has to undertake the whole matter.
Ques. Why "clothe thee with festival-robes"?
C.A.C. Because God will find pleasure in it, and His people be in full accord. It is things according to the most exalted thoughts of God. Like the "best robe" in @Luke 15 -- there is nothing to equal it. This passage has often been used in the gospel, but the real application of the chapter is to the saints whose garments have been defiled by unholy associations, and God undertakes to change all that.
This is one of the few scriptures which bring Satan personally into the scene. But Another -- the Angel of Jehovah -- is
{491}
brought in here. The Angel of Jehovah, I believe, always refers to Christ. Here Joshua stands in the presence of the mighty intervention of Christ, and we all stand there. What length of time there has been when there has been no exercise with the holy priesthood. It is Christ in chapter 3 and the Spirit in chapter 4. It is a question of God's sovereignty -- so with ourselves, we might have had no idea of the holy priesthood or the house of God. But God does it Himself and He does it through Christ. We are only "a brand plucked out of the fire". On our side we are nothing else and never shall be. Our blessing depends on our fully and honestly owning it. It is a question of getting God's estimate of things. Then all thought of self-worthiness vanishes from our minds and Christ comes into view -- nothing but Christ.
The priest is the most holy man in Israel. He stands in the presence of the intervention in Christ -- God has done it. His robes are changed. It is a wonderful setting. This chapter is for us. None of us could stand up before God and say we had nothing to learn from this chapter. "Take away the filthy garments from off him". Instrumentality enters into this matter. It is said to "those that stood before him". It is like @Luke 15. God does most of His work mediately, He uses His servants to take away the filthy garments. I think Paul was taking away the filthy garments in Galatians and in 1 Corinthians, though they were Christians and had the Spirit. God throws light into our souls as to what is filthy. Paul was showing this to the Galatians and Corinthians and taking it away through ministerial service. So it was with us, till God showed us the real character of things. 'Departing from what is not right' (iniquity) has to go on continuously. "I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I clothe thee with festival-robes". It is the Angel who does it. It is Christ Himself who removes at His own cost all that defiles.
Ques. Is that @John 13?
C.A.C. No, I think it is a little more what you get by being washed. The Lord says: "He that is washed all over needs not to wash save his feet". Joshua needed something
{492}
more than feet-washing; all that he was invested with had to go. It is what Christ has effected for us by His death. He has borne the judgment of all that is filthy -- all that is not of Himself He has borne the judgment of. If I am going on with it, I am going on with what Christ has died for. If the priesthood is defiled, it is in a religious way.
Rem. "And these things were some of you; but ye have been washed, but ye have been sanctified, but ye have been justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God" (@1 Corinthians 6: 11).
C.A.C. Very good. Though the Corinthians were not in the good of it, it was ministered that they might enter into it. It shows how necessary is the Spirit.
Ques. Why is the Spirit brought in there?
C.A.C. It brings in the need of subjective work. The judgment of the filthy garments has come into the soul by the Spirit. Along with that is the clothing "with festival-robes". God is very anxious that we should know that we are "in Christ". God has no pleasure in people who do not know they are in Christ. It is a complete thought -- "festival-robes". It is God's thought; we come to it, one might say, bit by bit.
"In Christ" is not festival-robes in Corinthians, though there is some thought of it in the second epistle. In I Corinthians they are "babes in Christ" -- only babes, though in Christ -- that is, in a very small way.
Ques. Is it new creation? "Old things have passed away; behold all things have become new"?
C.A.C. Yes. Our first apprehension of it is, we are justified in Christ. It is only a gospel one. We are justified in another Man, not in ourselves. We need to grow in our apprehension of it.
Rem. "Now He that establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is God" (@2 Corinthians 1: 21).
C.A.C. Paul has the full idea. Then in @2 Corinthians 12: 2, "A man in Christ". That is very different from a babe. We come in on our side by steps. We learn we are justified in
{493}
another Man -- that other Man has righteousness for us. Then we are alive to God in Christ Jesus. There is a blessed Man in heaven, we learn, who lives to God. We take account of ourselves alive to God in another Man. Then in @Romans 8 we are "in Christ" for deliverance -- a further apprehension. None of those thoughts are up to the "festival-robes". It implies we have apprehended the full thought of the purpose of divine love, we are invested with it. So I think it goes with @Luke 15. They are things to pray about, that we might apprehend them -- the full thought of God in a glorified Man.
It is all in view of the service of God. What a richness about the worship there would be if we all assembled in festival-robes! The "man in Christ" goes up to the full height of the divine thought. He could go anywhere in that realm -- the third heaven -- without a sense of disparity. So @John 17 is given to us. The Lord is putting the pure turban on our heads there.
Ques. Would Ephesians be on the line of setting a pure turban on the head?
C.A.C. Yes. We should be able to address God with priestly intelligence. If brothers did not go beyond their measure, there would never be anything said that was not in priestly intelligence. It characterises the assembly. We should be in the sense of our portion and able to speak to God about it without any disparity between our thoughts and God's -- in ourselves we are only poor things plucked out of the fire. All this enters into our responsible service in the house of God (see verses 6, 7).
Christ is Minister of the sanctuary and His charge would be that we should see that what is suitable to God's house should be carried out, and so we are able to anticipate the coming of the Lord.
Wherever "the Branch" is mentioned I think it refers to the coming of the Lord. There are four or five scriptures which refer to Him as "the Branch". The assembly is here awaiting the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ -- that is the Corinthian aspect. The Branch (or "the Sprout") is
{494}
connected with His growing up out of His first coming in manhood, and is linked together with His appearing. The great objective of all Scripture -- of God -- is the coming of the Lord. The first prophet spoke of it -- Enoch -- I do not think anyone awaits His coming or appearing who is not in priestly fitness. It required priestly conditions in Luke. It means that everything that is unsuitable to His rule will disappear.
Rem. "In those days, and at that time, will I cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land" (@Jeremiah 33: 15).
NOTES OF A READING
@Zechariah 3: 8 - 10; @Zechariah 4: 1 - 14
C.A.C. There is full recovery of priestly condition in chapter 3: 4, 5, so that in faithfulness there is liberty to judge God's house and keep His courts. Saints here are in responsibility, and the restoration of the priesthood is a very important feature at the present moment, the holy service of priesthood having been for a long time practically lost. Joshua, always regarded as a representative man in this book, is now clothed in festival-robes and is seen having fellows that sit before him.
Ques. Are those that sit before him the same as those "that stand by" in verse 7?
C.A.C. I think those "that stand by" are the same as those in verse 4 "that stood before him". There were those who were near to God and had His mind. He (Joshua) would move in the circle of those near to God and in the intelligence of His mind, and who could act for Him.
The "fellows" in verse 8 are those who in measure had gone through the same exercises as Joshua and so could
{495}
recognise that the priesthood had been restored. Well, there are those here like it today.
Ques. Why are they sitting?
C.A.C. It signifies that they have definitely and permanently occupied this place. Defilement has been removed and what is suitable to God has been brought in.
Rem. God has thus material on which He can work out His thoughts, so He immediately brings in Christ.
C.A.C. Yes. We need to see that God has recently been dealing with the priesthood. Those who sit down and contemplate this are men who are marked off.
Ques. Why is that?
C.A.C. It is to stimulate our desire to be one of them. Why should we not be a witness? There is such corruption and departure of the priesthood today, that is in what pretends to the priesthood -- false thoughts as to empty ceremony or a class of priests. We should be concerned for true priesthood to be restored. There should be a model of what true priesthood is before God. If a few walk in the light of this, it is a witness to all Christians.
Ques. What does the priesthood mean?
C.A.C. It is the ability to serve God according to His pleasure, so that there is intelligent worship. It must be in spirit and truth. The turban on Joshua's head signifies liberty and intelligence in worship. So we have to be careful that when we come together to worship we are in priestly condition and intelligence.
Rem. If not we do not get the benefit of the introduction of Christ.
C.A.C. That is so.
Rem. In Hebrews we are first to "consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession"; is that like this?
C.A.C. Yes.
Rem. In chapter 6: 12 you get, "Behold a man whose name is the Branch; and he shall grow up from his own place, and he shall build the temple of Jehovah".
{496}
C.A.C. If you are building you must consider Christ. He is the Builder of God's house; you must consider Him. So all in the house now depends upon a proper consideration of Christ.
Rem. "Christ, as Son over his house". It is a question of people with intelligence.
C.A.C. When He comes, everything is to be for God's pleasure in the house and in the kingdom. The remnant anticipate this, they are to build in the light of all Christ would do in a coming day.
Rem. So that the service of God goes on now.
C.A.C. Yes, all should be according to Christ. Its value is measured by that. The Lord's supper is to bring Christ in prominence before the saints. If we are going to worship God, we must bring in Christ, and the Supper compels us. It is an essential thing to bring in Christ. He is "A Branch of righteousness" in @Jeremiah 33: 15, and everything He brings in is just right. By and by this will be done publicly, but among the saints He is doing it spiritually now.
Rem. "In one day" iniquity will be removed.
C.A.C. Very beautiful -- iniquity gone and brotherly love established (verse 10). It should be so now among the brethren.
Ques. Does it involve the place Christ was coming into as Man?
C.A.C. Yes. It speaks of a Man in chapter 6: 12. Branch means "young shoot" -- everything springing up afresh for God.
Ques. In @Isaiah 53: 2, "He shall grow up before him as a tender sapling". Is the thought embodied in that?
C.A.C. Yes, it is a beautiful description. It is a great turning-point in a soul when it thinks of Christ in relation to God. First we thought of Him in relation to ourselves, but now it is a priestly view of Christ. God is presenting Christ to the priesthood, we know Him in relation to God. It is something to covet to see Him in relation to God. It is a revolution in a soul when that comes to pass. "Glory to God in the highest" is what He is to God.
{497}
The stone is another view of Christ. The Spirit seems in this book to delight in bringing in a multitude of thoughts of Christ. The stone would bring in the thought of building. There is One who is qualified to establish everything for the pleasure of God in the most perfect way -- the seven eyes give the thought. It is how we know we regard Christ in a priestly way. No doubt the seven eyes are in @Isaiah 11: 1, 2; "There shall come forth a shoot out of the stock of Jesse, and a branch out of his roots shall be fruitful; and the spirit of Jehovah shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Jehovah".
These are perfect qualifications to bring in the pleasure of God. He has a sevenfold qualification.
Rem. The Lamb has seven eyes in Revelation.
C.A.C. It is wonderful ability to take account of everything in relation to God. These eyes running to and fro take account of all that is displeasing to God, and also of all that is pleasing to Him. It is not future. It is going on at the present time. So these seven eyes rejoice when there is anything done for the pleasure of God -- one stone placed on another, or a man with the plumb-line measuring according to God.
We get the Spirit in a sevenfold aspect in @Isaiah 11. We could not say the anointing is not shared by the saints, though humbled as we think of ourselves. It is God's mind for the saints. It is competence to govern. How could the saints rule in the world to come unless they are competent to govern? I sometimes ask people how many cities they feel competent to rule over.
Rem. "Who hath despised the day of small things?"
C.A.C. This book was largely written to show the remnant that they are not in a day of small things. Outwardly it is small, but what are they going on with? They are going on with the greatest things in the universe of God -- far greater than anything in the grandest cathedral. @Zechariah 4 is one of the most important chapters for remnant times. We do well to ponder it.
{498}
Rem. It is "every man his neighbour" (chapter 3: 10).
C.A.C. Well, you would like to share your vine and fig tree, would you not? You would not like to have anything you could not share.
Ques. Would there not be discernment? John says, "Ye have the unction from the holy one and ye know all things"
(@1 John 2: 20).
C.A.C. Yes. The other side is light. There is a system of spiritual light, so we need to pray over this chapter (4). There will be such for Israel in a coming day, but it exists today in a much greater form than it will in Israel. To understand it we have to look at the saints according to the working of God. We see it in Christ.
Ques. Where do we see it in Christ?
C.A.C. We see it whenever we look at Him. We see He is the transfer of all that is in the mind of God. It is all engraved upon Christ.
The lamp-stand is all of gold, nothing of the flesh or infirmity is brought into it -- that is all shed. For us it is a real difficulty because we see the flesh coming out in saints, also human infirmity that is trying. Now we have to get rid of any thought of both if we are to consider the system of light. We want to see saints as new creation, as born of God as John does, and we get some idea of the golden lamp-stand.
Rem. It says in verse 1, "As a man that is wakened out of his sleep".
C.A.C. Most Christians are fast asleep as to this, numbers have never seen it.
Rem. "Wake up, thou that sleepest, and arise up from among the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee" (@Ephesians 5: 14).
C.A.C. We are entitled to view the saints as new creation. @2 Corinthians 5: 17 is put in contrast with knowing people after the flesh. How do we know the saints? We are not with God, but at a distance, if we only know them after the flesh.
Ques. Why does Zechariah ask this question?
{499}
C.A.C. Young men are always full of questions if they are healthy. That is why they are helpful in the readings. Do we want to know these things, are they interesting to us?
Ques. Is the candlestick in the tabernacle Christ?
C.A.C. The candlestick in the tabernacle is Christ; all the figures in connection with it would suggest it being Christ. Here it is the saints -- the vessel of light. What they are after the flesh -- that is all passing, it is only for five minutes!
Rem. Balaam's prophecy would come in here.
C.A.C. We must first view ourselves in this light. Can I really shed off in my mind all my flesh and my human infirmity? If I cannot I am in a poor way.
You learn it first in yourself and then clothe the saints with it (that is how God views them). The apprehension of it gives us power to walk in the Spirit. Then we would seek to bring the saints into the light of it. It is not what is abstract here, but what is responsibility. The golden bowl suggests being filled with the Spirit, it is a containing vessel. We ought to think a good deal about that. If I thought of myself as part of it, it would have a very sanctifying effect upon me.
In the Old Testament the Spirit comes upon a man and so today may result in a marvellous preaching, but here it is a containing vessel. It is given to us, that we might enter into this, as though God says, 'I want you to be near to Me in the thoughts of yourself and of your brethren'. It is not doing wonderful things, it is a containing vessel. It is not something once a year, but continual.
{500}
NOTES OF A READING
@Zechariah 4: 1 - 14
C.A.C. We have been speaking of the encouragement there is to the remnant to go on building.
Ques. In what way?
C.A.C. There is encouragement in the part the Spirit has in this chapter. I wondered whether the way He is presented in this chapter might go with John's gospel. There is no thought of imperfection in the vessel in John's gospel. I wondered if that would answer to the pure gold.
Ques. You mean in the testimony of the Lord?
C.A.C. Yes. It is a vessel of light which is characterised by perfection. The number seven occurs, and "pure gold". In John the Spirit is viewed as dwelling in a vessel that does not at all obscure the light. Things are presented here to see how much we are able to profit by. It is an abstract view in John. It is brought in as if suitable in remnant times, as in John.
Ques. Would you give us references in John showing what you mean?
C.A.C. Every reference to the Spirit involves that the vessel does not hinder it. @John 4: 14, "The water which I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life". And @John 7: 38, "Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water". So these things are very exercising -- these references to the Spirit are more exercising than in any other scripture.
Rem. If unhindered, the Spirit will rise up to eternal life.
C.A.C. So every reference in John is very challenging.
Ques. Is it a question of what you see?
C.A.C. Yes, it determines your exercises and prayers.
Rem. Zechariah was wakened up.
C.A.C. I think we are all very much in that position. We all have experienced an awakening. If the Spirit were left out
{501}
there would not be much there. We are in the time of the Spirit. The Spirit of God had us in mind in inditing this chapter.
Ques. Would the exercise be how far we see the movements of divine Persons?
C.A.C. Yes, and that we see the character of the times. The Angel speaks about eleven times in these chapters. Zechariah is a man receiving communications from heaven. It is not denied to us.
Ques. What is the lamp-stand?
C.A.C. The lamp-stand represents a vessel of divine light. It is different from the lamps in @Revelation 2 and 3. There was much there to dim the light.
Rem. That is why you connected it with John's gospel.
C.A.C. Yes.
Rem. "As the Father sent me forth, I also send you". John regards the abstract view. So you would not despise a day of small things.
C.A.C. The olive-trees, the bowl, the pipes, etc. all raise the exercise as to what part in this wonderful vessel we are prepared to take.
Ques. In Luke's gospel they awoke and saw His glory and with Him two men, Moses and Elias. Would that be the glory of the lamp-stand and the two sons of oil standing with it -- in that setting, what the prophet sees?
C.A.C. Nothing is of value without the Spirit. The "bowl" is a containing vessel. The assembly in @John 14 - 17 is a wonderful containing vessel for the Spirit.
Rem. Also in early Acts where they were of one accord in one place.
C.A.C. The thought of flow runs right through in this figure -- a continuous flow, a very beautiful thought in connection with the Spirit. We have not to do with the initial pouring out of the Spirit, we are too late for that. We come in now for the flow of the Spirit.
Rem. "The supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ". It is what we need.
{502}
C.A.C. We would look for this flow of the Spirit specially in our morning meetings. There is no thought here of lamps being trimmed or replenished. It is a continuous flow.
Ques. What is implied in the two olive-trees, would it be @John 7?
C.A.C. Well, that is a kindred thought. The assembly is a self-contained unit here. In every part there is the flow of the Spirit. We ought to have holy aspirations in regard of this, that there might be more flow of the Spirit when we are together. The flow depended on the maintenance of the testimony. This chapter directly links with @Revelation 11. Faithfulness in testimony is the source from whence the Spirit flows among the brethren.
Rem. Three chapters in John are to furnish the saints for maintaining the testimony. "He dwelleth with you, and shall be in you", and other quotations.
C.A.C. We should not use stock phrases or get into ruts in our expressions, even relating to divine Persons, if in the flow of the Spirit. There would be a fresh presentation in words not before used, for the Spirit knows a great deal more than there is in the Bible.
Ques. Would the seven pipes to the lamps speak of abundance of supply?
C.A.C. The seven pipes and seven lamps would speak of completion and the spiritual perfection that marks it. Oh, we need more exercise as to this flow! In Scripture we have what is adequate, though John says, "Not even the world itself would contain the books written". The Spirit knows every one of them. We could go outside of scriptural expressions; I think that is the flow of the Spirit. It does not need the Spirit to quote Scripture. But what is said must accord with the Scriptures. They are the divinely appointed boundary. There will be an immense deal more in the holy city than what is put in the Bible! "The Spirit searcheth all things, even the depths of God". "The depths of God", that is far greater than Scripture. It is a wonderful mediatorial service of the Spirit.
{503}
Ques. Is that why things are left unexplained, for instance in @Colossians 3: 1, "Those things which are above" are not enumerated? We might think we knew them.
C.A.C. The house of God must be great enough to contain all that is in the mind of God as far as it can be known to creatures -- those are its dimensions. The building in remnant times was exactly three times larger than in Solomon's time. You may have things in greater spiritual reality now than when they were first committed to men. They had no right to talk about a day of small things. All God says of it is to magnify it. We ought to have the idea of finishing the house on Lord's Day morning. Zechariah begins and he finishes, and God's thought is that everyone who begins finishes it. I think it is builded and finished every Lord's Day morning. When the Headstone comes in it is finished -- when Christ comes in as Head. We should come to the thought that we are complete in Him -- filled full in Him. We have reached the headship of Christ, and there is nothing more. Not one generation passed before the whole thing was lost as held in responsibility, but God's acting in mercy may give greater things than when left to responsibility. "His hands shall finish it" refers to anyone. He has not properly begun if he has not finished!
Rem. So in Matthew it is, "And behold, I am with you all the days, until the completion of the age".
C.A.C. The vessel of light refers to all that was in the mind of God at the moment.
Rem. "Jesus the leader and completer of faith".
C.A.C. Very good. In Revelation we get, "I have not found thy works complete before my God". The works are incomplete, and God does not like it.
Rem. We sing sometimes, 'Eternity's begun'.
C.A.C. That is the completion. You touch in affection all that is in the mind of God -- you complete it. God does not like it if we do not. We should move on more steadily in the service, with a steady, not a fluctuating flow, if we gave more room for the Spirit.
Rem. With Moses and Elias, Moses did the inaugurating,
{504}
and it was finished by Elijah, who recovers the people to the true God and His service.
C.A.C. From that point of view we are in the days of Elias.
Ques. What is the great mountain?
C.A.C. Anything that stands in the way of God's people reaching His thought -- slowness within or opposition without. Nothing can stand against a company in the flow of the Spirit. We can be very orthodox and have read all the brethren's books and be knocked over in a moment.
Rem. "He shall bring forth the headstone with shoutings: Grace, grace unto it!"
C.A.C. It is our privilege to salute Him as Head -- otherwise we are not properly under His headship. Then we can go on. He can lead us to the Father.
Grace is the most comprehensive thing in the universe, reaching down to a poor sinner and ending in glory, embracing all on the way. After being saluted as Head, the Lord would lead us on.
Rem. He is on our side Godward.
C.A.C. Yes. Zechariah represents the royal element in the saints that will maintain all that is due to God (he was a prince of the house of David), as Joshua represents the priestly element. The "sons of oil" would come into action as saints are able to take up kingly and priestly state. Zerubbabel is the responsible builder and he had the plummet. All must stand its test. In everything connected with the assembly, order has to be maintained. The "sons of oil" bring in the supply. The principle of faithfulness is of great importance, because that is the outside place. If the witness position is right, we shall become sources of the oil supply when we come together.
Ques. They would work together, would they not -- acting and re-acting?
C.A.C. Nothing is more interesting than to see the relation between @Revelation 11 and @Zechariah 4. In @Revelation 11
{505}
the temple, the altar and the worshippers are measured, though not a single stone is put down actually. All is thus secured spiritually -- it is measured -- very much as it is today. The two witnesses are outside, in sackcloth, showing this witness goes on with the setting up of the temple. These things are a great exercise to me. There is a great realm of spiritual blessedness that I have not made my own yet.
Rem. That is rather discouraging to us who feel you know most about it.
C.A.C. You do not call that discouraging. The object of our reading is to see things according to God. So we pray on that line.
What goes on in the world is controlled so as to be favourable to the building of the house. A clergyman said recently: 'We hope the war will not stop; we never knew so much movement in the souls of men before'. I would not like to go back to Pentecost. What had they? They had Peter's ministry, but they had not Paul's and they had not John's. In the vessel of light the Spirit is viewed in the wonder of His operating whether I know it or not. This is to come out in our building of the house.
Ques. What part have the sisters in it?
C.A.C. Perhaps they do most of the building. The flow of the Spirit is not confined to ministry. The sisters can cherish the great divine thoughts better than the brothers. Their prayers are serviceable, and as they talk together they can add impressions that all enter into the building.
This is a wonderful chapter as giving us the spiritual side. What the devil does is given in chapter 5, and we are to take account of that too.
{506}
NOTES OF A READING
@Zechariah 4: 1 - 14; @Zechariah 5: 1 - 11
C.A.C. We should see the force of what comes out in chapter 5, if we see its connection with chapter 4, in which we get the thought of a vessel of light connected publicly with what is said to flow through it. The lamp is said to be gold, and the oil is said to be gold too. Have we sufficiently apprehended the lamp as a suitable vessel for the Spirit? At the beginning there were those who companied with the Lord, who were formed in features corresponding to Him, so that there was no disparity in them as they received the Spirit. The Lord companied with them as risen. So they are persons who do not put any difficulty or obstruction in the way of the Spirit. I think we should pay serious attention to this.
Ques. Would you think neglect of this would hinder our meetings?
C.A.C. I think chapter 5 is the enemy's work to counteract all in this vessel to contain light. The vessel is divine workmanship and so suitable for a spiritual flow.
Ques. Would that ensure that all that passes through would be gold?
C.A.C. Yes, I think so. But, if the expression may be allowed, we think too much of the action of the Spirit in the assembly. I am not sure that we should look for that. The assembly is a circle or sphere that is marked by the action of spiritual persons.
Ques. Do we seek to take account of the Spirit apart from condition in the saints?
C.A.C. What is of the Spirit is in a vessel, so it is not exactly the action of the Spirit, but of spiritual men. So we get no mention of the Spirit in @1 Corinthians 13 and 14, chapters which have to do with the character of the vessel. So it is the vessel that comes into evidence in all ministry; it is not the Spirit speaking. The gifts speak according to their
{507}
own measure, and it is for the saints to say how much they say is of the Spirit. Ministry is the service of spiritual persons, and what is to be said is to be said intelligently.
@Zechariah 4 is one of the most important chapters in the Old Testament. It suggests a spiritual flow through a vessel. Three nice young men once told me that the reason why they had not opened their mouths was because they had never felt led by the Spirit. The enemy had succeeded in keeping them bound for years.
Rem. Paul refers to the Spirit speaking expressly.
C.A.C. That would be a sovereign action of the Spirit speaking directly, and in Acts where He said, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul", it was as a divine Person speaking.
Ques. Would you distinguish for us between chapters 12 and 14 of 1 Corinthians?
C.A.C. The manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man. It is the man who has the gift of faith, the word of wisdom, etc. A qualification is bestowed by the Spirit, but the person acts, and is spiritually suitable to act. The vessel of light is suitable. We want more spirituality. The spirituality of a meeting does not count only on the presence of the Spirit, but it is a question whether under the hand of the Lord I have been fashioned so as to be a suitable vessel.
Ques. How would you explain the Spirit speaking to the assemblies today?
C.A.C. What the Spirit is saying to the assemblies today is a general thought without reference to persons -- the whole vein and trend of what He is saying today. I do not think of persons.
Rem. It is said to the spiritual.
C.A.C. Yes. If I do not harmonise with what the Spirit says, I am out of tune and not qualified to serve. It is present and not past ministry. We are thrown back on spirituality. A carnal man could not tell what the Spirit is saying to the assemblies. We come together as spiritual persons to take up these things, we know what we are about. We have to act when we come together. The lamp in @Zechariah 4 is clearly
{508}
the vessel of light as it is known in a day of great weakness. They had stopped building, and this vision is used to encourage them to go on. It is peculiarly adapted to remnant times. If we want to get this lamp in the New Testament we get it in what is presented to the angel of Philadelphia. It is a revival of spirituality; it is restored in Philadelphia and we want to be in it. I hope every man, woman and child here wants to be in it. There is a company in Philadelphia with a little power, keeping His word and not denying His Name; that is, having every feature of true spirituality. There is nothing else in Scripture exactly like this, giving perfection in a self-contained vessel, having all its sources of supply within itself. It is a more beautiful figure of spiritual flow than in any scripture.
Rem. You make me feel glad not to be in the days of Pentecost!
C.A.C. I would like to make you feel glad that way! I have found 'Pentecost' Christians lamentably lacking in everything of value.
Rem. @1 Corinthians 13 has been likened to the oil by which chapter 14 has been carried out.
C.A.C. Yes, but it must be carried out in vessels. These pipes are very interesting as representing flow. There is a volume of light in freedom. 'Keeping His word' would be John held in assembly affection. Think of His word being kept by persons like you and me! It means all that is expressed in Christ in John is held in spiritual affections in the assembly.
Ques. Are these two representative men at the end of the chapter standing in contrast to the two women in chapter 5? There is dignity with them, they are "sons of oil".
C.A.C. There are various aspects here. One aspect is that saints can be sources of flow. Then there is a containing vessel, and then the seven pipes to each lamp. The sisters are not excluded from this. They are welcome to supply me with oil! Fancy seven sisters contributing their grace, etc., to help
{509}
a brother. Each lamp depended on the seven tubes. The lamp is what is done publicly.
Rem. It shines before the Lord of the whole earth. "Ye are the light of the world", the Lord said.
Rem. Is that not the whole bearing? These trees are competent to become sources of oil.
Rem. "Believe in the light, that ye may become sons of light".
C.A.C. There is to be no misrepresentation, no looking to take a place on earth before He does. What a vessel of light! The Lord sets it before us as His representation of each local assembly.
Ques. Are we to regard it as a grand possibility?
C.A.C. Certainly! It would not otherwise have been given, though we may have a good deal of exercise to go through for it.
Chapter 5 is Satan's answer to all God is doing. The mystery of lawlessness is Satan's answer to God's mystery.
Rem. Say a word as to the flying roll.
C.A.C. These are features that have come to light in Israel and more distinctly in the christian profession -- stealing and swearing falsely. I think christendom is marked by stealing what does not belong to it. There is not a christian truth that has not been taken up by the natural man -- it is all stolen goods -- the thought of being a Christian, of God, of the church, words and forms that only belong to the house of God. But God's judgment is on it all. What is not the product of God's work is all stolen by natural men. We should be very watchful that we are not trading in stolen goods. If I assume to be very spiritual and I am not, I am a thief. There are those that say, "Lord, Lord", and he says, "I do not know you whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity". It is all stolen goods. God is going to bring it all under judgment. We must come honestly by what we have spiritually through exercise with God, or it will only end in condemnation. Like the Philistines, it is a real danger. God
{510}
hates stolen goods. Swearing falsely in His name is connecting His name with what is not right. It is connected with a thousand things He hates.
Rem. We may get hardened ourselves as to all that goes on around.
C.A.C. The mystery of lawlessness, the woman, is put in the ephah, which is a measure. The element of lawlessness is working, but it is restricted. The great rebellion against God takes place even now (cf. Thessalonians). While we do not exactly feed on this, it is most important that we should know what is going on. The whole clerical system is connected with His name and He hates it. Taking His name in vain is connecting it with what is not true.
Ques. What is the meaning of the measurement of the roll?
C.A.C. I must confess I have no light as to the size of the roll, but no doubt it signifies something.
Rem. It says, "Speak truth every one with his neighbour".
C.A.C. We do not say, 'I am pleased to see you', without really feeling it.
We do not see the woman judged, she is reserved for a place in the land of Shinar, so we shall not see the mystery of lawlessness judged while the church is here. It will head up in the antichrist, the beast and the false prophet, and will be judged. It is seen here as reserved for judgment, and limited. What a comfort to see the woman put in the ephah, and the lid put on top of her. So the lawlessness now in the world is strictly limited and under judgment. It will come to a full head in its own place and it will be judged there. As long as government is maintained by God in the world there will be a check on what is lawless. The greatest check is the assembly as the vessel of the Spirit. This vessel is seen in @Zechariah 4, a vessel marked by obedience. So long as it is here maintaining the principle of obedience, so long the principle of lawlessness cannot prevail. It is the greatest barrier to the anti
{511}
christian forces of today -- not the aeroplanes, tanks and guns.
Under government, if you are so lawless as to murder, you will be punished, but the greatest moral restraint is the assembly marked by the meekness and gentleness of Christ -- that is the greatest barrier. Satan knows it if we do not. It is most instructive to see these two chapters together. So we want to go on with the vessel of light, do we not?
NOTES OF A READING
@Zechariah 6: 1 - 16
C.A.C. It is helpful to see that the prophet fills up the interval between the house of Jehovah being taken from Jerusalem and the coming of the Lord, the assembly filling its place in that course of time. Therefore the instruction is most helpful and necessary for us, as it was in Zechariah's day.
The first part of the chapter brings before us a subject very important for us to understand; that is, the course of what is going on in connection with the government of God in the world. The four successive empires of which Daniel has spoken are set forth in these four chariots.
Ques. Would their being referred to as spirits suggest that the government of God is a living and active thing?
C.A.C. Yes, and shows that Zechariah is not occupying us with the public history of these empires, but only with the hidden character of God's government as known alone to heaven which goes on as the gentile empires run their course. We are now in the time of the fourth chariot -- the Roman. It was there when Christ came into the world and has gone on all through and continues now. It is marked by strength.
Ques. Why is it here, "the Lord of all the earth", and in Daniel, "the God of the heavens"?
{512}
C.A.C. To show the earth is not left to itself; things are not allowed to take their course as if it was. It may not seem so, but faith understands there is the government of God going on all the time.
The chariots came out from between two mountains of brass. God's government as known to faith is a very stable thing. Romans tells us that the powers that be are ordained of God and are ministers of good to the people of God. It may be hidden from the natural eye, but is known to faith. Even in times of persecution faith discerns a secret acting of God.
Rem. Nebuchadnezzar recognises that the heavens do rule.
C.A.C. Yes. Horses are a symbol of earthly power, but are under control, and the fourth empire is as much under control as any. The first chariot had then passed off the scene, it was the time of the second chariot.
The black horses pacified God's anger ("These ... have quieted my spirit in the north country") in the overthrow of Babylon by the Medo-Persian power, giving satisfaction to Him because it prepared the way for the return of the remnant and for the house to be built. God always overrules things in a secret and very definite way for the blessing of His people.
Rem. Daniel says, "In the days of these kings".
C.A.C. It is a comfort to know that there is not another, fifth empire. It is a great mercy, for there is nothing before the coming of the Lord. Military force is connected with the fourth power, as Daniel shows very definitely, which shows things are heading up. The control lies in the four spirits of the heavens, a power acting in a secret way and doing God's work. Things look perhaps as if they have been handed over to the enemy. Daniel gives the empires on the public side and Zechariah the secret side of God's government.
Rem. "To you it is given to know" (@Matthew 13: 11).
C.A.C. Quite so, and therefore we ought to know just where we are at the end of the times of the Gentiles. The
{513}
stone will crush the feet of the image and become a great mountain and fill the whole earth. We are just at that time. The times of the Gentiles will end in the judgment of those powers, and Christ's kingdom set up.
Rem. @Psalm 2 gives it, "The princes plot together, against Jehovah and against his anointed".
C.A.C. So He uses the rod of His anger.
Ques. Would their going forth into all the earth show they fulfilled divine purpose?
C.A.C. Yes, especially the last to cover the western world where christianity operates. It is allowed in God's government. It has been said that the greatest event in the history of the world since the flood is the christianising of Europe. That is like the work of the spirits of the heavens, is it not? God in a secret way is against evil, and if powers rise up against the Lord and His Christ, God will have to say to them. That vein of government which is in line with what is right, is according to the spirits of the heavens. God is controlling and limiting evil, as we saw in the last chapter.
Rem. What a comfort to know that He is still the Lord of all the earth. He has sovereign rights everywhere.
C.A.C. The principal thing with God is the blessing of His people and the prosperity of His work. We are subject to the powers that be, but knowing all the time that He whose right it is to reign is coming. It is not our confession that He is our Lord, but that He is the Lord of all the earth. This title had first been used in connection with taking possession of Canaan. His universal right was recognised in taking up a portion of territory. We have no rights here, but our rights are there. I have no right to my house, but He has right to it. Of course there is a providential title to it.
The second part of the chapter is of great importance as showing the gain which accrues to God from the sufferings that come upon His people under His government (verse 9). The priestly service is enhanced by the product of the sufferings of God's people. The remnant had been suffering for seventy years under the first of the empires; that is, when captive in
{514}
Babylon. Coming out of it they had silver and gold. They had acquired something which had its effect upon the priesthood. Whatever comes upon us in the ordering of God and we accept it, there is something we acquire from it. I suppose there are no saints that do not suffer from the government of God in some way. The acquisition of gold and silver largely depends upon our submitting to God's government. Jeremiah is great on that -- they must go into captivity and submit to it; if so it would be all right. Wrong-doing confessed does not arrest the action of divine government. It lands me into some kind of captivity, and if I submit to it I get some kind of gold and silver out of it. At the present time some of God's people are suffering severely under the government of God. If they submit there will be gain. Rather than praying for relief we should be praying for more for God out of it -- more crowns to put on the head of the priest. We should all aspire to have some material in the temple gained through our exercises, thereby getting spiritual substance, so that we can put crowns on the head of the priest. The idea is that the result might be something more precious for God in the assembly than ever before. Do we think to ourselves, this is going to bring something out of me to contribute to priestly service?
Ques. What would silver and gold represent?
C.A.C. Silver and gold signify the knowledge of God -- everything precious that is in the knowledge of God. Silver is redemption, and gold new creation.
Ques. Would this be true of every believer?
C.A.C. Certainly -- if he submits, not otherwise. If we do not submit to the government of God we get nothing.
Rem. Job says, "He trieth me, I shall come forth as gold".
C.A.C. Yes, he submitted. We often fight against it, but God keeps on with us until we submit. Then we get increased knowledge of God and every bit helps to enhance the priesthood. We have not an instance of the Lord submitting Himself to the powers that be.
{515}
Ques. Jehovah will refine Israel "as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried", and he will say, "It is my people; and they shall say, Jehovah is my God". Is that it?
C.A.C. Yes, so something is gained.
Ques. Why the change from "the house" to "the temple"? What is the difference?
C.A.C. It was the same building actually, of course. The house view of it is where God is known in His grace. In the temple there is light as to His mind. Both thoughts combine.
Then, "He shall sit and rule upon his throne". That follows on Joshua getting the crowns on his head. They are now qualified for a new apprehension of Christ as the Branch -- a largely increased apprehension of Him.
Ques. Would you explain, "He shall grow up from his own place"?
C.A.C. It is a very precious allusion to His incarnation. His incarnation is not only the basis of everything -- His offices and glories -- but truly more wonderful than anything else we shall ever know of Christ.
Ques. "He shall grow up before him as a tender sapling". Does that refer to the same?
C.A.C. Yes, His incarnation and acceptance of His appointed place as coming into the world in incarnation, the smallness, the reproach, the feebleness -- He accepted that place. We can learn how Christ can fill every place in glory, because we learn how He filled His place in incarnation, for there is no other way. A new shoot out of the stock of Jesse sprang up; it was entirely new.
Ques. In the Father's acclamation of the Son, would it not speak of His freshness there?
C.A.C. Yes, I think so. "The holy thing also which shall be born". It was an entirely new kind of manhood, true humanity, but humanity after its own order. It was life when everything was dead in Israel. We Gentiles are learning it, that we must have life in Christ -- an entirely new source.
{516}
Jesse is a type of the faithfulness of God, and everything springs out of that in fruitfulness. Christ is the greatest expression of God's faithfulness to man.
Rem. "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up".
C.A.C. Resurrection power was inherent in Him. Who ever heard of a dead man able to raise himself? The whole truth of divine Personality is wrapped up in that. The point here is that "he shall build the temple of Jehovah". It is said twice, it is emphasised. One of the first things He made selection of was Peter as a stone. It is good to regard ourselves in that light, taken up by Christ as living stones to be put in the temple, set there for the service of God. We should value that as much as anything. It is the greatest thing on earth today. "The temple of God is holy, and such are ye".
"And he shall bear the glory". There is no one great enough to bear the glory of what subsists now for the pleasure of God. No one but Christ could bear the glory of sonship as applying to us. "The glory which thou hast given me I have given them". We get it as realising it is given to Christ -- that is how we get it. The building is to go on in all the light of this. If we want to be occupied in building we must take in all these wonderful thoughts. "And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house". And bearing the glory is sonship. He alone is able to bear the glory of it before the Father at this minute.
Ques. What is the glory in @John 17: 5?
C.A.C. That is His place in Deity. The Father has given in manhood the glory of sonship. It is that of which He bears the glory that He gives. Of course He has a place as Son that belongs to Him and no other, but He bears the glory of sonship to share it.
Rem. He is "Christ, as Son over his house", in @Hebrews 3.
C.A.C. He is referred to in Hebrews as Aaron typically. It is not so much what He is on the throne, but His glory in sonship. We are too apt to connect sonship with ourselves,
{517}
but we need to look at Christ. We are sons by adoption, He by gift and as begotten.
"That they may behold my glory". The glory of Christ as loved by the Father before the foundation of the world, we are privileged to behold, but never share.
Rem. There is conferred glory, and inherent glory which is never shared.
Rem. "He shall be a priest upon his throne".
C.A.C. He fills the office of Priest in relation to that system of things in which He rules. It speaks of sympathy. Then, "The counsel of peace shall be between them both". That is the greatest of all. Jehovah, and below a Man, He who rules. A stability of unity lies in matters entirely between the Father and the Son, complete unanimity between Both and everything secured by divine Persons entering into this divine counsel -- the saints given by the Son to the Father; by the Father to the Son, and then handed back to the Father.
NOTES OF A READING
@Zechariah 7: 1 - 14
C.A.C. Some progress had been made in the building of the house at this time, so that it answers to the present time.
Ques. Is there a continuous thought in connection with the building of the house?
C.A.C. The house was there so that it could be recognised, so the men could be sent. It was actually half-finished, it took two more years to finish. We are about there now. We cannot say much about the house being finished, but a start has been made, saints walk together in the recovery of the truth of the house, so there is a place of enquiry.
Ques. Could features be distinguished so as to designate the house of God?
{518}
C.A.C. If saints are found in grace walking together in holiness and truth it should be possible to be discerned. Then there would be enquiry. There is very little enquiry in christendom today, very little that an exercised soul could turn to and be certain of getting a divine answer. So we should seek to walk humbly before God, so as to have the marks of priesthood easy to be discerned, something other than human expediency and all the wretchedness of man.
These men came with an excuse. They had fasted and wept about the captivity throughout the seventy years, but it was not genuine. 'Did you do it to Me?' Jehovah said. It was a sort of religious activity, and men are ready to acknowledge God in a certain way when in distress; it quietens the conscience of a man without there being any desire to conform himself to God's mind. So Jehovah said, 'You did not do it to Me'. There are many movements in the religious world that seem good and suitable, judged by man's standard, but how much is there really of God in them? This is the test we should put so that we are not deceived by false appearances.
It was a time of great affliction, and it is a time of great affliction now, we might say. We should judge if there is any genuine desire to come into line with God's mind; otherwise there is not much in the fasting and weeping.
Rem. The men came from Bethel.
C.A.C. Which had been an idolatrous centre. God calls attention to the moral state of the people in answering, and to what had brought down His judgment. He would always give a reply to people and point out their failure to answer to Him; therefore it must be rectified for relief to come in.
He calls attention to the fact that their relations to the brethren were not right. "Execute true judgment, and show loving-kindness and mercies one to another".
Rem. The word of the Lord comes directly, we repeatedly read, so He keeps in contact.
C.A.C. It is God's great controversy in christendom, the disregard of brotherly relations.
{519}
Ques. Would the same apply to the Supper in @1 Corinthians 11? "When ye come therefore together into one place, it is not to eat the Lord's supper".
C.A.C. It was disregard of all that was brotherly. You are eating your own supper, the apostle says. There is no consideration of the brotherly bond. Even the Lord's supper was made a selfish thing. So in christendom, 'Take this in remembrance of the Christ that died for thee'. That is a purely selfish way of doing it, it is not done in the brotherly bond. They do not even know the person kneeling next to them. The brotherly relation of saints is ignored and trespassed against.
Rem. Divine conditions are transferred.
C.A.C. All our relations with God depend on our relations with one another; that is, on right approach to God. "If therefore thou shouldest offer thy gift at the altar, and there shouldest remember that thy brother has something against thee, leave there thy gift before the altar, and first go, be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift" (@Matthew 5: 23, 24). That is, the service of God depends on our brotherly relations being right. I may disregard the matter, but I have no access to God. The Lord has set up these brotherly relations and they are not to be trifled with. He has set us in family relations; we did not establish them; it is an obligation. None of us can choose whether we walk with our brethren. It is evil not to do so. If we do not, we are transgressing against the whole dispensation of grace. "Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another" (@Colossians 3: 13). It is grace, and we are not to be on the line of demand, but to walk in the love of the brethren. Things are recognised as trying to the brethren, but if I am in the spirit of the dispensation, I can overlook a thousand things.
Rem. "Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted" (@John 20: 23). Remission comes first.
C.A.C. Remission comes first because it is the natural function of the assembly to remit, abnormal to retain. The
{520}
defaulter may show no repentance, so sins have to be retained.
Rem. What is inside is shown outside. "Show loving kindness and mercies", it says. It is the light coming out.
C.A.C. It is the character of God coming out in His people, not just the doctrines they hold. Love is the fulfilling of the law. You will not murder, steal, do harm, for love will regulate it all. This beautiful brotherly bond is what God is concerned about. That is why the people lost the land, it says -- by these things.
When the Lord says to Ephesus, "I have against thee, that thou hast left thy first love", He is, I think, referring to activity of love toward the brethren; I do not know if I am right. "Love one another, as I have loved you" -- I understand that is first love. We all feel rather small in the presence of such a standard, but who would have it otherwise? It is the secret of all church failure, declension and worldliness that have come in.
Ques. Is that why brotherly love is found in Philadelphia?
C.A.C. I thought so; it is restored in a remnant, and if we yield ourselves to God He will help us as to these brotherly relations. We shall be jealous over the details that might impair them.
Rem. @1 Corinthians 13 would help us as coming between the other two chapters.
C.A.C. Yes, I think so. It is the nature of a living organism. The body is a living organism, as every organism is. It is God's nature, He is love. If He loves and says, 'You are not like Me', how dreadful that is. John speaks of His love, following on the Supper -- the giving of His body and the pouring out of His blood are the great evidence of it.
Rem. "If we love one another, God abides in us, and his love is perfected in us".
C.A.C. Beautiful! There has been more failure in that than in anything in the church. It lies behind every failure in the church that ever took place.
Rem. So it is the principle taken to recover things.
{521}
C.A.C. If the house is to be built, this feature must be incorporated. It crowns all.
Love is more connected with children than with sons. It is more on John's line than Paul's, as connected with a nature. In Peter's epistle we have "growing up" in the nature, so then he speaks of living stones, because the nature is there. God has been pleased to beget children; there is nothing more wonderful than that. They have the same nature as God. This is put in contrast to that which is formal and religious; it is not fasting and weeping, but brotherly love, so the divine nature is observed.
So you can understand God's feelings in the next chapter -- the intensity of feeling expressed there. "I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great fury". God's heart burns when He sees the coldness and deadness of those who profess to be His people. If He sees any disregarding the brotherly bond His heart burns.
Rem. Seeing the gospel in the light of God's feelings puts quite a different colour on it.
C.A.C. The prodigal comes to the house. God does not send a ticket for the house! Some are content with a ticket for heaven; well, it must make God's heart burn. It is a cold kind of thing to be merely content to go to heaven. God says, I want you in my house now, I want you to enjoy being My child now. That is not always how God is treated now, and His heart burns. If God returns to His original thoughts, and He is doing so after being despised for two thousand years, He says, 'I am going to take the matter up Myself'. The great thought of God is Zion, He returns to His great universal thought for all His people. But He has come back, that His people may come back to them. What is in the mind of God, what does *He* want? is the question. Am I going to be so foolish as to miss all that is in the heart of God?
Rem. There is a golden thread through all the Scriptures, God having a people and being with them.
C.A.C. Holiness and truth must mark His house. To Philadelphia He introduces Himself as "the holy, the true".
{522}
Rem. "Being renewed in the spirit of your mind; and your having put on the new man, which according to God is created in truthful righteousness and holiness".
C.A.C. That is the thought of the new man. It takes all the brethren to make up the new man, just as it takes all the sinners to make up the old man. The new man is a creation. It is created in holiness and truth. That is the creation to which every saint belongs. All the work of God in our souls goes on in recognition of this, that there is such a thing as the new man, and we put it on -- a new moral character which links us with all saints. As they are supposed to have put on the new man the Colossians and Ephesians were marked by love to all saints. You cannot help loving them if they are brethren, so you want to walk with saints, but it is difficult because they bring in barriers not according to holiness and truth. If they discard the old man and put on the new man we should love to do so; there would be no difficulty. Unless I have put on the new man Scripture would not regard me as a Christian. Many things have not been taken up by saints; they do not know what you mean by the new man in which there is nothing of the old left, "Not Greek and Jew ... barbarian, Scythian, bondman nor freeman". That is all gone, and you are brought into a new man where there is nothing but Christ. So then we can walk together. It is a terrible blot if anything of the old man comes in.
The city is marked by two things; experience and potentiality -- the young and old. God does not speak of people in maturity here. God loves to think of saints with long experience of His ways. He delights in old saints, in their sixtieth or eightieth year. It is sixty years since I first trusted the Saviour and I wish I had more experience of God. He looks for maturity of experience. There is great potentiality in the young ones -- those breaking bread in their early teens -- so there is great interest for God in them. The two classes are mentioned, as if they are there we are all right. There is no trouble about what comes between, if you get both features in a meeting -- age and youth. We should look at a boy or girl
{523}
with a kind of reverence, as you do not know what God is going to do with them. So it would make us very careful how we handled young people. We do not want to come down to their low level of sport, we want to lead them up to the high thoughts of God. A young man might ultimately be the greatest evangelist there ever was.
God can do anything in remnant days. 'It is wonderful for you, not for Me', He says. We must get away from a mean, miserable view of things. Let us get nearer home, nothing is too wonderful for God to do in me if I yield myself to Him.
NOTES OF A READING
@Zechariah 8: 1 - 23
C.A.C. There is comfort in this scripture as applying to the days in which we find ourselves. The laying of the foundation of the house of Jehovah really changed everything in the position of the people.
Ques. You mean God had taken account of the start that had been made?
C.A.C. Yes. Through the mercy of God some little start has been made in the house today. We cannot say much, but there is some little thought of what is suitable for God, a place where He can be served. It ensures blessing from God, such a thought in our hearts makes blessing certain among ourselves, and in the gospel too.
Ques. Does it mean that if a start is made the saints can count on God doing everything to enrich and further that movement?
C.A.C. Yes, so that we do well for ourselves if we do well for God. The reason for the poverty of christendom today is that there is no consideration for God.
Rem. A man cuts himself off from a rich supply if he leaves God out.
{524}
C.A.C. No agricultural work was going on, the land lying fallow, the vines not cared for, barrenness not fruitfulness, for that is what "no hire for man, nor any hire for beast" means.
Rem. Because the conception of the house had not come into the minds of the people.
C.A.C. Their indifference to the house robbed them of the fruitfulness of the land. We do ourselves wrong if we neglect the house.
Rem. The inheritance contributes to the house.
C.A.C. It is an impoverishing thing to neglect God's house. If there is a beginning, He comes in at once. The secret of all the spiritual blessing of these years is that a few hearts began to consider for God.
Rem. Verse 10 says, "I let loose all men". Now they are to be brought to dwell together.
C.A.C. We can all bear witness that God has lavished a wealth of ministry as never in the history of the church before -- a vast deal more than we can take in. We can all bear witness to it. We have not any of us had barns big enough to put it in. It came out of that one simple fact of a few faithful hearts beginning to consider for God.
Rem. "Prove me now herewith, saith Jehovah of hosts, if I open not to you the windows of the heavens, and pour you out a blessing, till there be no place for it" (@Malachi 3: 10).
C.A.C. Well, we can all bear witness to that. I do not say we ought to be content because we have not storage room for it.
Ques. Do you make any distinction between the foundation of the house laid and the temple built?
C.A.C. They are two sides of the same thing. The two sides come out in @John 2. There the men had turned it into a house of merchandise and we see the zeal of the Lord which drove them out with a scourge of small cords, and consequent upon that all the wealth of the gospel comes out, because of the character of faithfulness in the Son of God. So at the finish there was not room to receive it. John's gospel
{525}
tells us so. "The which if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself would contain the books written".
I think we have to wake up to the fact that God has taken in hand to bless His people. He is doing it abundantly, we only have to see that we maintain the conditions. Those seen in 1 Timothy are suitable. "That thou mayest know how one ought to conduct oneself in God's house". There are spiritual sensibilities developed in the saints. So we know how to speak truth to our neighbours (the persons in our local assembly), a great mark of faithfulness in the remnant.
Rem. "They that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another".
Rem. In @Luke 1 the kinsmen were in the hill-country of Judaea, those to whom communications were made.
C.A.C. We can say truly we are all competent to speak truth one with another. If not, we had better get converted again! Speaking truth means that we are conversing together of the great things of God. Truth comes in a good deal in the epistles of John -- walking in truth, whom I love in truth. Speaking the truth is for eternity. It is an eternal matter. There is too much wasting time and gossip with us; we have the truth to speak about.
Ques. Is it a progressive idea, "That the temple might be built"?
C.A.C. Yes.
Rem. "Speak truth every one with his neighbour, because we are members one of another" (@Ephesians 4: 25).
C.A.C. It is speaking truth, something that is going to stand for eternity.
Rem. So we get back to the foundation, "the assembly of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth".
C.A.C. Wonderful to have neighbours with whom we can speak truth! To be able to say, 'He values it as much as I do, perhaps more'. That line of things would soon turn the fasts into feasts, would it not?
Ques. What is the difference between speaking truth,
{526}
and the execution of truth and the judgment of peace?
C.A.C. Truth is to be taken up in a practical way, it is to be applied, so we do not go on with what is not according to truth.
Rem. The whole walk and deportment is to be governed by the truth; it controls the whole of our lives.
C.A.C. The truth dwells in us and we are the exponents -- that is the idea of christianity. It is the truth in the saints that has the power, not the truth in the Bible. That is the letter, the truth in the saints is the Spirit. The truth of Scripture becomes living in the souls of the saints, and only as it does is there any real testimony for God. We can help one another in the practical application of truth. A neighbour is one near to you.
You can have good fellowship meetings; there were four here in the year at any rate -- "cheerful gatherings" (verse 19).
This is very important because it is the foundation for blessing in the gospel. Things must be right inside first.
Rem. "Ye shall be a blessing".
C.A.C. Yes, people heard of it. "In those days shall ten men take hold, out of all languages of the nations, shall even take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you; for we have heard that God is with you". That is the gospel side of the matter. There are such conditions that people are attracted. You cannot expect people to be converted otherwise. Cheerfulness is contagious.
Rem. "I announce to you glad tidings of great joy". It resulted in great joy. Would it help in inviting people in?
C.A.C. I think God intends to make His grace attractive to men. They see the happiness it has brought to His people; not only a preacher, but a lot of faces shining with brightness.
Ques. Should not the preacher himself have some odour of brightness about his too?
C.A.C. It has been said that no one could hear J.B.S. preach without feeling he had something worth having.
Rem. A man said he was converted by the 'exceeding cheerfulness' of Mr. W., not by anything he said.
{527}
C.A.C. It was a divine cheerfulness of people concerned that God should have something, and they are a happy people.
Rem. Some feel the seriousness of the gospel as well as the joy of the gospel, not all are alike. Tears ran down Wesley's face while preaching.
C.A.C. That is not the gospel quite. The gospel is a most happy theme of what God is in grace. "We joy in God" -- Stephen was happily affected before preaching. His face did not alter in spite of the recounting of a history so sad. It was still as the face of an angel.
Ques. Would they enjoy eternal life in these feasts?
C.A.C. Yes, they were enjoying the land here.
Ques. Why did they say, "I will go also" (verse 21)?
C.A.C. They were of one mind, because of what is so attractive at Jerusalem. In the last verse it is, "We will go with you; for we have heard that God is with you". It widens out to all languages of the nations -- to a wide extent of grace.
Rem. These are national movements unlike the eunuch travelling to Jerusalem alone.
C.A.C. These people in figure were changing their city; they find God's city is the only place worth going to.
Rem. The normal effect of the gospel is to bring people to God's centre.
C.A.C. Yes, to bring persons to the house of God. There are rival centres as seen in the next chapter. They rose up while Jerusalem was in ruins. God looks at them all and sees not one that He can support. As today, God does not recognise them.
Rem. It leads on to the full blessing of Israel.
C.A.C. Yes, but all in a remnant time. He supports what is of Himself -- Zion. It is the same today, as @Psalm 87 tells us, "Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion", and, "And of Zion it shall be said, This one and that one was born in her". People take character from the places where they are born. But God only recognises one city.
Rem. The ten men would be in keeping with the remnant
{528}
character. The blessing overflows to such an extent that a tithe of nations are brought in.
C.A.C. That is very beautiful, it is the same today. There is only one centre. How could it be God's house if He has not His own way? He will not recognise man's way.
Rem. If God is giving His support, that is the evidence.
C.A.C. Yes. God does not recognise quite contrary systems. "I will encamp about my house". God's house is very precious to Him. It is only a feeble beginning here but God recognises it and encamps round it. That is what God is calling upon people to do today, to come to His house, to serve Him, and to be for His pleasure.
Ques. "Him that is a Jew". Would that be one moving with the truth?
C.A.C. Those who are separated to God are the true Jews. The Jew comes in in remnant times when the rest of the people have departed. You can understand how beautifully the thought of Zion's King coming to her is brought in. In tribulation the remnant would have all the time the thought of Christ coming to them. It is Zion's King, to Zion He comes, not to Damascus, and not to Philistia. I think He comes as choosing that place. So today as building God's house we look for Christ to come to us. I think His coming is to do with remnant times and in such a way that only love will recognise Him. It is as Zion's King, but as a poor Man, meek and lowly, with no pretensions about Him that he comes. Only love could recognise Him, and it is thus that He comes to the assembly. It is a beautiful awakening. The Lord comes as veiling His glory, He will not make any impression on the natural man. We ought to have that much more in view than we do; we should be looking for Him to come to us. We ought to be looking for Him all the time. "Behold, thy King cometh to thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, even upon a colt the foal of an ass". In both aspects He presents Himself in such a way as only love could recognise Him. Its application to us is the Lord manifesting Himself. When He appears publicly there is no possibility
{529}
of any not recognising Him, but He may come to a few of His saints in assembly character and not be recognised. It is the lover who recognises Him. John said, "It is the Lord", and "He that loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will manifest myself to Him". Here it is the sovereignty of mercy and what is universal -- His universal thoughts of blessing. It is Zion He comes to here. A man is blessed and made happy, and blessed to others; it is all a matter of sovereign mercy, and the ground of it all is the Lord Himself coming to His own.
NOTES OF A READING
@Zechariah 9: 9 - 17
C.A.C. It is evident from this chapter, as from many others, that all blessing depends on the entrance of Christ in lowly grace, and the rejection of Him the case and ground of all judgment.
"Having salvation" shows that everything hangs upon Him. It is all within the compass of His own Person, and He will ultimately speak peace to the nations and His dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth. But it has not pleased God that His power should be manifested in any public way yet, so His coming is in lowly grace, and is a great test for everybody. It was a test for Jerusalem, and they crucified Him, for the godly remnant and they received Him.
Rem. In principle that extends to the ends of the earth.
C.A.C. Everyone is tested by Christ, and by Christ as come in lowliness. So as we find here it is the prisoners of hope who get delivered. He came to open the prisons to those who were bound; wherever there were those who were conscious of bondage and looking for deliverance He set them free, and He is doing it still -- on the ground of the blood
{530}
of the covenant. The whole system of judaism had become a "pit wherein is no water". The Lord's invitation was to come to Him.
Ques. Should not the assembly have an ever-increasing appreciation of the royal glory of Christ? Though not in display, He is for us the King of glory.
C.A.C. And He has salvation, it is in Him, so whatever bondage we may be in there is power in Him.
Ques. And would you not say this lack of water marks christendom today? God may be named but there is no reference to the mediatorship of Christ.
C.A.C. Yes. God is mentioned, but not Christ. Religious people do not speak of Christ but of 'Almighty God'. There is little sense of the wonderful mediatorship of Christ. It is indeed a pit with no water -- just as true today as it was of judaism, and this mighty King comes to set prisoners free.
Rem. "And he shall speak peace unto the nations", is a wonderful thought.
C.A.C. When He does it, it will be effectually done-the nations will have peace. All blessing now is found in a remnant.
Ques. The expression, "daughter of Jerusalem", does it speak of the remnant?
C.A.C. They were able to appreciate the lowly King -- that is, Zion, speaking of God's sovereign mercy. The prisoners of hope can appreciate mercy. There are certain persons for whom nothing will do but mercy, and all Christ brings is for them.
Rem. To such the Lord really becomes supreme, He becomes King, not in terms but actually.
C.A.C. He really fills them in relation to God, "And they shall be filled like a bowl, like the corners of the altar". There is a sacrificial vessel used to hold what is presented to God, so persons are vessels filled in relation to God. God likes full vessels and He has made provision for securing them in this way.
Ques. Is there a connection between the covenant and the bowl?
{531}
C.A.C. Yes. The prisoners being set free is all based on the covenant. Through the death of Christ there is entire liberation from every bondage, so that they can become bowls for the service of the altar, instead of being empty.
Rem. It is cheering that God gets it today before He gets it publicly.
C.A.C. Yes, He gets it in bowls today who are full of what is delightful to Him.
Rem. It is the result of Christ being enthroned in the heart.
C.A.C. Yes, He subdues everything in us that hinders us in serving God, if we let Him be King.
Rem. The colt upon which He rode would exemplify that; "Upon which no man had ever sat".
C.A.C. The colt here brings in the thought of carrying Him in testimony. That is one side of the position, while the bowls are more the sacrificial side to be filled for God's pleasure. It is what marks the assembly. Every brother and sister ought to be a full bowl. Everybody ought to be ashamed to come if he is not full. "None shall appear before me empty". In the light of that we should be afraid. Seeing He has dedicated us for altar service and that it is all that He has done, it is enough to fill any heart.
In John He brings it all on the footing of resurrection, because there He raised Lazarus from the dead. It is in the light of resurrection, as here it is on the ground of His death. It is the Lord's doing, He has brought it about -- cf. verses 16, 17. The flock comes to light. "For how great is his goodness"; everything rests on the goodness of God. We cannot bring a thing to God that is not the product of His own goodness. "They shall be as the stones of a crown". The saints are jewels to enhance His glory. We talk about the Crown Jewels sometimes -- well, here they are! The most wonderful miracle has been brought about in any heart that appreciates Christ. Think of the precious character of Christ's humanity. If we come before God full of Christ, He says, 'You are My jewels'. No one could think of a creature adding anything to God, God adds to the creature. He adds all the preciousness
{532}
of Christ to us. "To you therefore who believe is the preciousness", and as being full of that we are very acceptable to God for the altar.
Ques. Is that what being complete in Him means?
C.A.C. It is all filled out of Him, and it is that or nothing -- either the fulness of Christ, or nothing. If I have Christ, I have all that is in Christ. Many years ago a woman said to me, 'I have had Christ for twenty years and I am just beginning to find out what there is in Him!'
The saints today are in the place of this, and God's thought has not broken down. It is all because of His goodness and beauty. It is remarkable that it should speak of God's beauty. There is something, speaking reverently, in the blessed God that is beautiful to the creature. Worship is the admiration of God, and this must be adoration. It is God presenting Himself in beauty to His creature and, of course, in Christ.
Rem. "Worship Jehovah in holy splendour".
Rem. The meek and lowly character of His coming is not mentioned in John's gospel.
C.A.C. In John it is divine power in that Person in resurrection, so they hail Him as One in whom resurrection power dwelt, and that colours all our worship. There is that in Him that is greater than death.
Rem. These moral characteristics would seem greater than His official glories, because they speak of His Person.
C.A.C. All His official glory is hung on what He is personally, and to see the goodness and beauty of God expressed in Him in the gospels -- that is real wealth in the soul.
Rem. To see "God manifest in flesh".
C.A.C. Quite so. So as saints we are qualified to speak to God as those who admire His beauty. I think His graciousness is His beauty, the quality of divine Persons that prisoners who come up from the pit know how to appreciate. That is the moral beauty of the saints -- salvation -- no mark of the world on them.
Rem. "Thine eyes shall see the King in His beauty" (@Isaiah 33: 17).
{533}
C.A.C. Very beautiful. It is a case of inheriting as entering into what God is restoring in these last days. He is restoring it now through the assembly. That is what is brought out in chapter 10 -- His power to restore things when they have been lost. The greatest of all is assembly restoration. "I will save the house of Joseph and I will bring them back again ... and I will answer them". And further on, "Their heart shall be joyful in Jehovah ... And I will strengthen them in Jehovah: and they shall walk in his name, saith Jehovah" (chapter 10: 6 - 12). It is God's great pleasure in restoring His people to Himself.
Rem. That makes the worshipping company.
C.A.C. God has no pleasure in that which has departed from Him (chapter 10: 2, 3). There we see a general character of things in which God has no pleasure -- vanity and false shepherds -- so He takes the matter in hand Himself, and He speaks of restoring His people to a full appreciation of Himself. Well, we are living in a time when God is doing this-for the remnant of the assembly.
Ques. In verse 17 how does the corn come in?
C.A.C. It shows it is a well-nourished people who can take up these wonderful thoughts. God is suggesting something tonight that would do so, in what is Christ. Then the Spirit would sustain all that is subjective.
Ques. The sons of Zion, would they come in here? God has His sons, strong and moving in dignity.
C.A.C. God intends to bring this all about in the restoration of Israel, but He has not a smaller thought for the restoration of the assembly, including everyone that has the Spirit. He is restoring all this for our hearts profound delight, that there may be service to God.
Rem. All the precious things are available at the close of the church's history; the gold, the eye-salve, etc.
C.A.C. We are really living in the best time there ever was. There never has been such a time and there never will be again. The millennium will not be half so wonderful as the present time. If God brings His people recovery, it is wonderful.
{534}
Rem. He makes them as "his majestic horse" (chapter 10: 3).
C.A.C. If so we shall be overcomers every time and never succumb to the influences of man. The covenant is the basis of everything. If we get away in our hearts from the death of Christ, we shall get away from all we have been speaking of. The corn (resurrection) becomes the food of the sons of Zion. The idea of the flock is not the value the flock gets, it is the owner who gets the gain of the flock. When God restores He does it properly, He restores to the very best.
In @Matthew 13 it is the public history in the first four similitudes finishing with the whole mass being leavened. The woman does her deadly work too well. After that you get the similitudes of the treasure and pearl -- what the assembly is to Christ. It is remarkable that He brings that in at the end. It is as if He says, 'I have watched the seed, the mustard and leaven going from bad to worse in the church publicly, now I am going to effect something else. I am going to restore things to the treasure and the pearl. I am bringing My saints back to that'. So this is not so great as what He is effecting in the assembly today. So we should understand this from these scriptures, He is bringing His saints back to His best and choicest thoughts, that they might be overcomers in the strength of what God is for us.
Ques. Is this greater than assembly privilege?
C.A.C. It is the highest point in assembly privilege, is it not? To joy in God, there is nothing greater than that in eternity. It is a wonderful time we are living in and we do not want to miss it. There is something given now not known in the church since the day of the apostle.
{535}
NOTES OF A READING
@Zechariah 11: 1 - 17
C.A.C. I think we have observed in going through this book that there is a series of special subjects treated, almost a distinct subject in each chapter. We saw last week that God had visited His people for restoration and to make them overcomers -- that is, the remnant -- but in this chapter we see the solemn condition of the nation that would not be restored and that refused the service of the Shepherd. That was the state of Israel when the Lord came. It was such that they were not at all prepared to appreciate the service of the Shepherd, though He was there among them to render it; therefore there was nothing for the Shepherd in a state like that but judgment; the flock was a "flock of slaughter". So the Lord when here had to discriminate between the nation generally and their shepherds, and the persons He speaks of as the poor of the flock, evidently a distinct class, distinct from the flock, which is a flock of slaughter.
Rem. "Fear not, little flock, for it has been the good pleasure of your Father to give you the kingdom". Are those they?
C.A.C. They were evidently the poor of the flock. Our first hymn book said, 'For the Poor of the Flock'. It was not a bad title. I suppose it was changed to 'The Little Flock' for some reason, but it is not a bad title if you read it in the light of this chapter. They were those not going on with the self-righteousness of the nation, but who appreciated the service of the Lord. Of the nation John the Baptist said, "The axe is applied to the root of the trees" (@Luke 3: 9).
Rem. The first three verses are a sort of summary of the preliminary action of judgment of the nation.
C.A.C. Yes, I thought so. Judgment is imminent. So when John the Baptist began his service he saw many of the
{536}
class referred to here and said, 'Ye are a generation of vipers'. That was the state of the nation when the Lord visited it. But the poor of the flock submitted to John's baptism. 'It is all finished with us, we must go out of sight', they say.
Rem. The thought of the remnant goes through.
C.A.C. The thought of the remnant is the golden thread running through. We have the same kind of thing now. The man in the street would say, 'We are not heathen, not Mohammedans, we are Christians'. Well, it is a flock of slaughter; that is, judgment is imminent. The condition is such that people are not prepared to appreciate Christ, and He served the flock of slaughter. His service is there now for all christendom, but it is only sin-convicted souls who can appreciate the Shepherd. They are people who can sing, 'We love to hear the Shepherd's voice'.
There were those in the place of shepherds, the scribes and Pharisees and the doctors of the law. The Lord was vexed with them, and they loathed Him -- a very strong expression. I have often thought that the Lord's death-warrant was signed at the beginning of His ministry when He said, "Unless your righteousness surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter the kingdom of the heavens" (@Matthew 5: 20). They did not see their righteousness was in Him, if they would accept it (verse 8). That is the Lord speaking prophetically. I believe if things were put to the test He would be found loathsome to the religious leaders of today. The best bit of flesh in me hates God and hates Christ. Many people would say it is not true, but it is divinely true. And that led to the Lord not being appreciated in His readiness to serve. All today is for the religious leaders, for those who loathe Him, but there is no appreciation of Christ; it is a very solemn thing. He asks, 'What value do you put on My service, what do you think it is worth?'
Rem. He is the altogether lovely One.
C.A.C. In the prophet it is put in a permanent form of application, so He says to everyone tonight, 'What value do you put on My service, what is it worth?' It is not simply singing
{537}
a beautiful hymn, but the practical side is whether we are ready to be more devoted to Him today than yesterday.
All is measured in the assembly by our appreciation of Christ. We value one another on that basis, not for social position or lack of it. It is a searching question, so He says, "Give me my hire". This is said to you. "And they weighed for my hire thirty silver-pieces". It is the price of a common slave. We might walk in company with the brethren or the Lord for a number of years and yet be ready to sell Him for a few shillings. It was cast to the potter in the house of Jehovah. Judas took the money and forced his way into the precincts of the house where none but priests could go, and it was there as a witness of what value men put on the service of Christ.
Rem. Things are estimated truly in the house. There the true value is the way in which they can speak of Him to God.
C.A.C. Yes. As together in assembly there are certain organs of expression and they tell how they value Him, so that if it is in the Spirit every saint can say, 'That is just exactly what I should like to say'.
Jehovah would not let Him take it, and said, "Cast it unto the potter". Jehovah said that to Christ, 'Do not take it, it is not worth it'. There may be some things said now to Christ like that. It is not worthy of Him.
Rem. It is a question of whether we have counted Him preferable to other things during the week, otherwise it is only words.
C.A.C. That would grow out of His service. How dear He became to those whom He had served and fed, and who had hearkened to His word. 'He has a value far beyond anything that I could express', every saint on earth would say.
Rem. He brought us by His shepherd care to this week.
C.A.C. Yes. So Christ is more precious this week than last, I am more prepared to suffer for Him this week than last -- that is the normal progress of saints. The shepherds loathed Him, very strong language, but the poor of the flock value Him.
{538}
Rem. They gave heed and knew it was the word of Jehovah.
C.A.C. As we give heed, we become more and more convinced that what we hear is of God; we do not want books of Christian evidence.
Ques. Why the thought of the potter?
C.A.C. It was cast to the potter in a kind of derision, do you not think? It is God's derision of man's paltry estimate of the value of the service of Christ. But the assembly is a company where He is appreciated. The poor of the flock become the real flock, while Israel was His flock ostensibly. He became the centre and bond of communion, but then that is why a convert is drawn to the assembly, because he finds some who think much of Christ. Some think as much of Him as I do, and some think better of Christ than I do, he feels. That is the real way of coming into fellowship; you want to be with people who think well of Christ. Where there is want of appreciation of Christ, everything breaks down. He has to break both staves asunder; all fails in the connection with the non-appreciation of Christ.
Ques. Why are the staves called Beauty and Bands, what is the signification of the names?
C.A.C. Last week we were reminded of the beauty of God, and you suggested that beauty is graciousness; now the moral beauty of God came out in His desire that all nations should share with Israel in the blessedness of Christ. That was the covenant made to Abraham. "In thee shall all the nations of the earth be blessed". They were to be the first to appreciate Christ, and then all nations. If they did not, then all God's design for the nations broke down. I know it was taken up in a new way after His resurrection, but it all broke down with them, and the leaders loathed Him.
Rem. I thought the staff was connected with the care of the sheep.
C.A.C. And His thought was the Lord serving Israel, and if all appreciated Him there, it would widen out to all nations. But instead Israel became a curse to all the nations,
{539}
and is so to this day. They carry the hatred of Christ to all the nations, the rod is broken asunder.
And then Bands, "And I cut asunder mine other staff, Bands, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel", that is, the Lord had in mind that Judah and Israel should be united in the appreciation of Himself.
Rem. Israel is what He had in mind, but it all broke down.
C.A.C. These thoughts that broke down are taken up in a new way in the assembly. The thought of brotherhood is taken up in the assembly. It was to be founded on the appreciation of the Shepherd, and it was broken. God is working today to bring about brotherhood founded on the appreciation of Christ. The unity of the one flock is brought about by appreciation of the Shepherd. "There shall be one flock, one shepherd". A public unity might have been even yet if the appreciation of Christ had not failed. All divisions show governmentally that the rod Bands is broken.
Rem. "That he should also gather together into one the children of God who were scattered abroad" (@John 11: 52).
C.A.C. Non-appreciation of Christ is the cause of all divisions, whatever people may say about doctrine or personal grievance or differences of opinion.
Rem. The potter is concerned with the clay, which is out of the earth, earthly.
C.A.C. Yes, we have to come to the Shepherd -- a new character of Christ. This book is rich with presentations of Christ, as Builder, as the Branch, as Priest and King, and now as Shepherd. There is power in the Shepherd to unify all the people of God in the world. There is no pleasure to God in a national religion, or in adopting the principles of a particular sect. What God delights in is appreciation of Christ and that saints should walk together on that ground and no other. We find the Spirit never deviates from that ground. "He shall glorify me, for he shall receive of mine, and shall announce it to you" (@John 16: 14). There would be no difficulties then. These scriptures are the word of God to us here
{540}
tonight. We must pray more in secret on this line. What is the good of coming to a meeting without having prayed beforehand? We should pray for more appreciation of Christ: 'Lord, increase my appreciation of Christ in this meeting, may I appreciate Thee more than ever in my life before'. All phrases and expressions would then be cast to the potter. It is the fresh appreciation of Christ, I see more and more, that is the thing to be at.
The last verse refers to antichrist, and it is either Christ or antichrist, there is nothing between. The "foolish shepherd" is antichrist, and christendom is drifting very quickly towards the time when they will refuse Christ. The wolf scattereth the sheep. John says, "Even now there have come many antichrists". They had distinguished the two influences at work. There is that which is of God leading us to value Christ more and more every week, and that tending to take us away from Christ. This is a very wholesome chapter.
NOTES OF A READING
@Zechariah 12: 1 - 14
C.A.C. God was encouraging the remnant in Zechariah's day by showing them what thoughts He had in His mind in regard to Jerusalem, and He would encourage us in our day by bringing before us the great thoughts He has in regard to the assembly, for the assembly now has the place that Jerusalem will have in a coming day on the earth. I thought John's sight of the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God was to bring before us God's great thoughts as to the assembly, so that we might enter into them. He does tell us that if we wash our robes we can go in by the gates into the city. It is not altogether a future thing.
Ques. Is it not a characteristic that He shows you things? We do not have to wait, but He shows it in its spiritual meaning.
{541}
C.A.C. So that we might be affected by it. God intended the remnant to be exercised. They prospered by it, and so we may do.
He is causing Jerusalem to be disliked and hated by all nations. It was all His doing. "I will make Jerusalem a cup of bewilderment ... and a burdensome stone unto all peoples", it says. Though it was God's chief interest, He would cause it to be seen that everybody hated Jerusalem. All the nations hated it, just as God's thoughts as to the assembly are hated today, every kind of corruption and imitation has been brought in, all opposed to God's chief interest.
Rem. In Revelation He shows the completed thought of the city and that He never deviated from it.
C.A.C. Yes, and after great opposition to His thoughts in the harlot. Christendom has taken on a character diametrically opposed to the assembly. If all the nations hated God's chief interest, then saints must be more devoted to it than ever. So the more the assembly is despised and hated, the more we should cling to it. God's thought is that the assembly should have the same place in our hearts as in His. He would bring that about in a remnant, so He says, in verse 4, "I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah". I think that is the position today.
Ques. Would you mind explaining?
C.A.C. The house of Judah is the people who pray.
Ques. Praise?
C.A.C. No, pray.
Ques. Where do you get that from?
C.A.C. It is what it says somewhere. @Deuteronomy 33: 7 says, "And this of Judah; and he said, Hear, Jehovah, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people".
Ques. Does Judah rather represent the remnant?
C.A.C. Yes, and is marked by prayer. He prays about things and he wants to be brought to God's people. They are people who really want to know about God's house and pray about it. Those are the ones that God opens His eyes upon
{542}
today. They are the companions to seek, those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart.
Rem. Verse I speaks of God laying the foundation of the earth and forming the spirit of man within him.
C.A.C. Great and wonderful as His works are, God's eye rests on His assembly today.
Ques. What does "And bring him unto his people" mean?
C.A.C. In your place in the assembly. If a man has concern about spiritual relations, and if he has any light at all, he must know that God has His assembly corresponding to Jerusalem, and such a one prays about it. "And the leaders of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength through Jehovah of hosts their God". That is, a sense of the value that attaches to the saints in Jerusalem comes home to them.
Rem. "Every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto Jehovah of hosts" (chapter 14: 21).
C.A.C. Very beautiful. That is the climax to this book.
Rem. They that have washed their robes have right to enter into the city.
C.A.C. That is chapter 13. It is a matter of divine sovereignty, but it is open to all to pray for all saints, because then we are bound to look at them in relation to God's assembly. The Colossians were marked by that-love toward all the saints. We must wake up to that privilege. If we pray for all saints we cannot think of a sect. Whoever heard of anyone praying, 'God bless all the Presbyterians, all the Baptists, all the Anglicans, all the Wesleyans', etc? You must pray for them according to their place in the divine mind. "The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength"; that is, we look at saints according as God has put them in the assembly. It is the assembly of God and He has given a great price for it. "The assembly of God, which he has purchased with the blood of his own". And as our prayers take on this character we shall get increased light as to the assembly. There is no doubt that this is how light came as to it at
{543}
first. Then you cannot tolerate anything that is contrary to it. "In that day will I make the leaders of Judah like a hearth of fire among wood", etc. "And Jerusalem shall dwell again in her own place, in Jerusalem". I take it that is what we ought to do, we ought to burn up anything that is contrary to God's thought of His people; we should burn it up in our prayers. He means Jerusalem should dwell in her own place, in Jerusalem. It is a day of recovery and God intends that a remnant at any rate should really dwell in God's thoughts about His assembly. This is the line on which God works if we pray about God's thoughts. We cannot do that without repudiating all contrary to them. We repudiate it in our own spirits, and as we do so we come to dwell in Jerusalem, in God's thoughts as to His assembly. He says something wonderful of such. "In that day will Jehovah defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem ... and the house of David as God, as the Angel of Jehovah before them".
Ques. What is the thought of the house of David?
C.A.C. It was the seed royal. These most weighty words are used to show how God will strengthen those who will take up assembly ground and make use of the provision given. There is no end to the strengthening for it. Well, we should entertain the thought of it. There is no limit to the thought of divine strengthening. "Strengthened with all power according to the might of his glory". That is the manner of the strengthening He will impart to His people, so we need not be afraid. All is intended to have a most energising effect, if we only take up the ground. It moves on the line of the house of Judah, that is the question of prayer, then we move into the thought as to the assembly, and then we take up the power. Nothing is so humbling as lack of power. I suppose the want of power is occasioned by our not taking up the moral exercises in this chapter. It is after they take up assembly ground that the spirit of supplications is poured out. It is looking at the assembly as a divine reality and carrying it on in a spirit of grace and of supplications.
Rem. Judah abides forever, and Jerusalem from generation
{544}
to generation.
C.A.C. Well, it is very interesting to see that God saves the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David be not magnified over Judah. That is, God gives the first place to those that pray.
Ques. Would this be linked with the spirit of sacrifice of Judah for Benjamin?
C.A.C. Well, if we pray, we are prepared to suffer for the things we pray for. It is no good for me to pray if I am not prepared to suffer for what I pray for. The glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem would represent abstractly what is true. We say all saints are of the assembly, but if we have not prayed about these things, we have not realised them at all. Many pious persons would assent to what I have said, but without prayer these things are only terms and phrases. Israel will go through the deepest exercises. If we take assembly ground, God raises moral exercises with us. He is not doing so in the sects, He lets them drift along at their own level -- so the people go through the deepest exercise as to their treatment of Christ. They would not be fit for the millennium without that, and no one is fit for the assembly who has not gone through this exercise. The most serious thing about us is how we have treated Christ, not our vanity, pride, etc. God thinks little of all the other wickednesses of man in comparison. Taking assembly ground we come to judge how we formerly treated Christ. It is not atonement here.
Rem. "Why dost thou persecute me?"
C.A.C. Yes, I think that is the idea. What gives such intensity really to the Lord's supper is the thought of how we disregarded Him. Now we love Him, and we cannot mourn sufficiently at having disregarded Him. We cannot afford to lose a minute now in making the very most of Him. A Son given, and yet they pierced Him. What profound exercises they go through.
Ques. Is it the line of things in Laodicea?
C.A.C. When you come to Laodicea He has no place at
{545}
all, except outside the door. How have I treated Christ? How have I treated Him this week? Have I acted as one who thinks everything of Christ and nothing of any other man? It is very searching. What a relief it is to come together for the Supper, to make up for the years in which we treated Him so badly.
Rem. In @John 19: 37, "They shall look on him whom they pierced".
C.A.C. That was the great sin of the Jews. He ought to have been most precious to them. In christendom His name is professed, but He is pierced all the time. It is thus we are ready for the fountain in the next chapter. We are purified in heart from all uncleanness.
NOTES OF A READING
@Zechariah 13: 1 - 9
C.A.C. I suppose we gather from the first verse that the Lord has means available for the cleansing of His people, so that their former state of sin and uncleanness may be removed.
Ques. Is it not significant, the fact of its following on the great mourning in the previous section and history in connection with Christ?
C.A.C. Yes, I thought so. That would produce the desire for cleansing. The thought is suggested in many parts of Scripture of cleansing by water, but it is not quite as the old hymn says, 'There is a fountain filled with blood'. That is an unscriptural thought.
Rem. The mention of water occurs very frequently in John's writings, connected with the thought of cleansing, does it not?
C.A.C. Yes, the thought of washing is often in Scripture. "Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and
{546}
I shall be whiter than snow". It is the result of washing by water, not by blood. We can perhaps understand better the cleansing by blood because that is purely under the eye of God, while cleansing by water is a moral reality brought about in the saints, as I understand it.
Rem. "Washing of water by the word".
C.A.C. Yes, we get that thought.
Ques. Is the washing by water of those in positional nearness, at least those brought nigh, the people of God, or is it wider than that?
C.A.C. It seems to be the first step in God's ways according to @1 Corinthians 6. Paul mentions a number of things and he says, "These things were some of you; but ye have been washed, but ye have been sanctified, but ye have been justified". It seems to come two steps before justification.
Ques. Is it not all because of the blood?
C.A.C. Yes, but not in atonement here. I doubt if that question is raised in the book of Zechariah. No, I think it is the moral character, such as God refers to in @Ezekiel 36: 25, "And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean". "The washing of water by the word", that comes in as a continuous process. The assembly is sanctified by the washing of water by the word. But the washing of water here is brought about once for all. "Ye *have been* washed", Paul said to the Corinthians, and "Ye *are* clean" the Lord said to His own.
Ques. Is that why prophets and unclean spirits pass out of the land?
C.A.C. Yes, in moral cleansing these things have no place. It is a setting aside of the former condition.
Ques. As in baptism?
C.A.C. Yes, it is a kind of finality Scripture speaks of as the washing of regeneration; that is, coming into a new order of things of which every saint is conscious. Putting off the old and putting on the new -- every saint is conscious of it. "Born of water" comes into it clearly, the whole person takes on a new character. If we do not understand that, we do not
{547}
understand much; we do not understand what it is to be a Christian. It is the outward means of purifying. It is the seeing in the death of Christ the closing up of our former state, and the washing brings that to us in a definite way so that we know it as a reality.
Rem. It says, "In that day".
C.A.C. Yes, it is looking forward surely to that day when it will be brought about for Israel in the knowledge of the death of Christ. Israel will come under the action of the fountain then.
Ques. Is not His death referred to in the thought of His being pierced?
C.A.C. Yes, but it brings in the thought of the wickedness of men.
Ques. Will the land come under this cleansing?
C.A.C. Yes, all religiously unclean will pass out of the land. It is what comes to pass in christianity, the false prophets have gone, we do not listen to them.
Rem. So it is not a case of "Ephraim is joined to idols", but, "What have I to do any more with idols?"
C.A.C. Yes; we do not want anything but what is of God. If you could not sign that statement you are not Christians at all.
Rem. Numbers speaks of the water of purification.
C.A.C. Yes, it is the setting aside of the former state. Baptism is a clear indication that a man's former state is gone -- buried. That is the teaching of it.
Rem. "I will cut off the names of the idols". Their names are not mentioned, their names are gone.
C.A.C. That is very good. You see what a complete cleansing it will be for Israel. They will destroy false prophets and they will speak of their Messiah in all His blessedness and glory. And surely they are not to be in a better state than we are; I would not like to assert that at all. It is the day of Christ as the end for faith and love of our former state. We come to that in our spirits. We are not Christians if we have not taken that ground.
{548}
Rem. When invited to shoot, J.B.S. said Mr. Stoney was dead.
C.A.C. It is the application of the death of Christ in its purifying power so that a man's affections are detached from all he was in flesh, and attached to Christ and all he knows of God in Christ. It is a new moral state. That is christianity.
Israel will benefit in the coming day. Not one will boast in being a child of Abraham, but in God and in Christ, and so will be morally clean. That sort of person is morally clean.
Rem. John stresses both the water and the blood. There are both.
C.A.C. In one way, but not in the sense we are speaking of. It is what is true all the time we are here. There is always the danger of retiring to the flesh, so that we leave the state we are in with God; something we have been delivered from we go back to and link on to it. That is very dreadful, for we are not true to our baptism. Peter was told, "What God hath cleansed, do not thou make common". The sheet of animals represented the gentile world that had come under God's cleansing. They were morally cleansed before, for they were judicially cleansed when they had received Peter's gospel.
Rem. "He that is washed all over needs not to wash save his feet".
C.A.C. Yes, I think that is the idea. An element of purification enters into the saints from the very beginning. We are cleansed to be suitable to Christ risen and glorified, which is more than could be said of Israel. God tells us in detail in @Ezekiel 36 how He will purify them until the point is reached in the end of this chapter: "They shall say, Jehovah is my God". That is a clean people.
Rem. Refining comes in in addition to the water.
C.A.C. It is a cleansing by fire.
Rem. That is a more drastic matter.
C.A.C. So the prophets are dispensed with -- those that give wrong impressions of God -- so room is made to bring in Christ in verse 5.
Ques. Why does he say, "I am a tiller of the ground"?
{549}
C.A.C. One comes in really to serve man on God's part. "He shall say, I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the ground; for man acquired me as bondman from my youth". That is the place that Christ has taken to serve man. It is a very beautiful thought, He came in to be acquired by man, to be a Bondman, to do anything and everything man needs. He came not to be ministered to, but to minister. Instead of His service being accepted, His hands were wounded. He was wounded in His very service. He was reproached for His service. One would have thought men would have been thankful to have such service, but Israel as such did not value it.
Ques. Why does He say, "I am no prophet"? He was the greatest Prophet.
C.A.C. I thought from this point of view the Lord disclaims being anything but a Servant. The condition of lowly service into which He came is the point of view in this book.
Rem. The prophets are cut off and He comes in on an entirely new basis.
C.A.C. Yes, I think so. His only thought was to serve men.
Ques. What would the thought be of the Husbandman?
C.A.C. "Tiller of the ground". He came to labour. A prophet would have some status and be rather an important personage. The Lord disclaims that. He came to labour, that was His object here.
Ques. Referring to Adam as tiller of the ground to produce that which is for his sustenance, is it here the Lord taking up what fell upon man?
C.A.C. Yes, and in that humble place of taking no reputation, a humble Toiler for the good of men. It is one of Zechariah's unique statements about the Lord you do not get anywhere else. It is just the opposite to what you get of man in his greatness. If we had nothing before us but the thought of service, we should be supremely happy. When we are not happy, it is because we are not in the spirit of service. The happiest people are those who are given up to service. I covet that for myself -- I should be a great man spiritually if
{550}
I coveted nothing for myself but serving the saints. It follows the purification of the fountain, which cleanses us of all those wretched self-importances that hinder our service.
Rem. "I am in the midst of you as the one that serves" (@Luke 22: 27).
C.A.C. Yes, His whole life was on that principle. It is very encouraging because it is open to us -- proposed to us -- to think of others and serve. The youngest child can take that up, willing to help and serve others. It is a wonderful model.
Rem. I notice in the tilling of the ground in Genesis, there is a river flowing out to water the garden.
C.A.C. Out of the service there is the living water going out of Jerusalem. In the next chapter it flows out of those who are set to serve. They do not think of themselves, then you get the water flowing out. The Lord serves in love, and will in a sense serve eternally; and in the days of His flesh He gets no recompense. His hands were pierced in the house of His friends, who should have thought much of Him. They were the very persons to pierce His hands.
Ques. Would you say something about verse 7, "Awake, O sword against my shepherd, even against the man that is my fellow, saith Jehovah of hosts"?
C.A.C. That is almost beyond us -- to find there is something in the pathway of the Lord that is far greater than His rejection and His piercing by men. He finds Himself in the position where He finds Jehovah's sword against Him, and He has entered @Isaiah 53. "We did regard him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted". That is what He was publicly. His service came to an end in the smiting of God. I find a fathomless depth in it which I cannot say much about. A time came when He was smitten, but not in atonement.
Ques. Who says this, "Awake, O sword against my shepherd"?
C.A.C. It says, "Saith Jehovah of hosts" (verse 7). The time came in the Lord's history when His service as Shepherd had to cease, and He had to taste what was before Israel, as about to be smitten and cut off, and He entered into their
{551}
position of being smitten and cut off. He felt it in His own spirit. It all came to an end, His service in the flesh and the fruit of it -- the few that He had gathered around Him scattered. It was God's doing. "Jehovah's fellow". It is just then, when in extraordinary humiliation, that He is always saluted according to His divine glory.
Rem. It is the same where it speaks of smiting on the cheek the ruler of my people.
C.A.C. Yes, the Lord had to face the smiting and the giving up of all the promises that centred in Him in the flesh. He felt it intensely. We see something of it, "Now is my soul troubled". It all had to be given up in view of being taken up in resurrection.
Rem. "Cut me not off in the midst of my days".
C.A.C. This is not the thought of atonement, for the sheep are scattered. It would be gathering if it were the assembly. "That he should also gather together into one the children of God who were scattered abroad". He said, 'You will all be offended in Me tonight'. They did not understand it and I feel how little I understand it. The Shepherd smitten and the sheep scattered, they had to go through it.
NOTES OF A READING
@Zechariah 14: 1 - 9, 16, 20, 21
C.A.C. We get still the thought of the remnant and the Lord's dealing with the remnant, so that in result their blessing merges in the full result of the divine ways. We can see this corresponds in great measure with what is going on now. He is dealing with the remnant and instructing them and putting them through discipline, and all He is teaching the remnant today is going to merge in the full blessing of the assembly and in a glorified condition; that is in substance what we get in this chapter.
{552}
Ques. Is that what we get at the end of verse 5, that the assembly will come into the good of things, "And all the holy ones with thee"?
C.A.C. We did not touch on the last two verses of chapter 13, and they ought not to be left out. We see in chapter 13: 6 what the Lord suffered from men, and in verse 7 we see what He suffered as the smitten Shepherd, which results in judgment coming on those who had failed to recognise His service. We find two parts cut off, but the third is left and brought into the fire to be refined. The thought comes before us that God secures a remnant whatever happens to the bulk of the people. The others are cut off in judgment.
Ques. "And I will turn my hand upon the little ones".
Would that be the remnant?
C.A.C. Yes, I think so. The present sorrows are God's judgment of an apostate or nearly apostate profession, and at the same time He is dealing with the saints in a disciplinary way, to refine the saints. It shows there is precious metal there, silver and gold, and it is to be secured without any admixture. There is always something there, but there is a good deal that is impure which has to be dealt with.
Rem. "The proving of your faith, much more precious than of gold which perishes".
C.A.C. Faith is very precious in the sight of God, so that He subjects it to testing that it might be purified. And that is going on at the present time. It is comforting that He has His hand in all that is going on. We ought to see that He is dealing judicially with all the nations. Chapters 1 and 2 of Revelation show that God's judicial dealings go on with the public profession -- it is shown there.
Rem. As to the value He secures in the saints, God keeps the matter under His control, as in @Hebrews 12 in chastening.
C.A.C. The trials of the path of faith in @Hebrews 12 nobody need have at all unless they wish. You can go out of the path of faith and avoid them. "But if ye are without chastening ... then are ye bastards, and not sons". It is a comfort now when saints are not suffering persecution that
{553}
we have this. But we are suffering along with others and not suffering for Christ, but it is the refining process by which God is purifying His saints and getting them ready for glory.
Ques. What difference is there between governmental dealing and judicial dealing?
C.A.C. There is judicial dealing in government, but we reap what we sow in God's government. But Christians sometimes suffer in the ways of God for no wrong-doing. Why should a bomb fall on a brother's house and kill him? It belongs to the inscrutable ways of God. There may have been nothing wrong with the brother, but it is to sanctify the saints. What falls on our brethren is intended to purify us.
Rem. "How unsearchable his judgments, and untraceable his ways!"
C.A.C. His government can be traced, but His ways are past finding out. Many a believer can trace God's government (and I know where I went wrong), but not His ways. Why did He allow James to be martyred? It was part of His ways, but they will all be justified by and by. The discipline of the Father is not always corrective, but it is instructive. A child is sent to school for instruction -- that is the primary object, not the discipline of the birch-rod (@Psalm 103).
Rem. "He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel".
C.A.C. So Moses prays, "Make me now to know thy way". He wanted to know God's blessed way in Christ. God says, 'All right', and puts him in a cleft of the rock and covers him with His hand while He passes by. He was going to put man out of sight in the rock and reveal Himself.
In the chapter before us Jerusalem is under judgment. There is a remnant who call on Jehovah's name at the end of chapter 13, and He will hear them. "I will say, It is my people; and they shall say, Jehovah is my God". But there are a lot of people in Jerusalem that do not belong to that remnant.
Ques. Why is it in verse 1 "the day cometh for Jehovah", as if it were not quite the full day of Jehovah?
{554}
C.A.C. I think that is right, as the first part of the chapter deals with God's preparatory ways. It was necessary that judgment should come upon those who rejected them, as it actually did on Jerusalem forty years after, and then the most awful judgment ever upon any city perhaps fell. But He secured a remnant, "The rest of the people". In the beginning of the Acts they passed over into the assembly.
What we find is that the Lord acts in a remarkable way for the remnant. He comes and stands on the mount of Olives.
Ques. Is this the carrying out of what the angel said in @Acts 1? "This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall thus come in the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven"?
C.A.C. Yes, "in like manner". It is contrasted with His entry into Jerusalem. It is a remarkable service of His love to the remnant. He comes down and the valley is formed so that the remnant can flee -- a beautiful way in which He comes in for the remnant. He provides for them in the mount of Olives position, not Jerusalem.
Rem. "He led them out as far as Bethany". Luke says He was taken up from there and He was going to come in like manner.
C.A.C. The mount of Olives is unique, and stands by itself. It is the mount of Olives in Acts l. It was really the remnant there that saw Him go from the mount of Olives.
There is the making of the valley by which the remnant flee, and the holy ones come (verse 5). They flee to that position in order to come back with Christ into the royal city. There is a wonderful analogy with what is going on now. In the millennium He is going to be King in Jerusalem, there is not any other. "In that day shall there be one Jehovah, and his name one". Before being King His feet stand on the mount of Olives and he makes a way out for the holy ones. They will go out into that valley to learn their association with Him. They learn Him in relation to heaven. It will be made known to them that for two thousand years their Messiah has been in heaven, all the while that the assembly has been here. Of
{555}
course our way out is the rapture, our way out is Ephesians and @John 20, that is, our heavenly position, and in actuality the rapture. We are going out into heavenly association, they go out and come back into earthly association. He would have a company of which He will be the ornament according to Isaiah. They will come back in association, as a queen in gold of Ophir and as the virgins that follow Him. Is that not the setting?
Rem. Yes. @Psalm 45 gives us that.
Rem. The dragon makes war with the remnant of her seed in Revelation.
C.A.C. It is the same remnant, but there is a beautiful touch here as to the remnant. The Lord is in the mount of Olives position before He is in Jerusalem, and that is where we know Him -- in His mount of Olives position.
Rem. He often resorted there with His disciples, as linked with Him.
C.A.C. Quite so, He resorted there as was His wont. It is His own place and is connected with the heavenly position and the Spirit. The remnant of the assembly has the privilege of going out now.
Rem. When David reached the summit he worshipped.
Rem. On the mount of Olives His disciples ask, "When shall these things be?"
C.A.C. There they receive instruction as to all that is going to happen in Jerusalem. We can go out to Him in the mount of Olives position; He is not yet in the Jerusalem position. This is a peculiar acting of the Lord for the Jewish remnant, which corresponds to the rapture for us. The Lord would separate us from the Jerusalem that now is -- the whole legal system. It was reproduced in judaism when the Lord was here and is continued in christendom, so the thing is to go out to the mount of Olives. We can do that in our meetings. There are two things that we do: sing a hymn and go to the mount of Olives. We may sing a hymn, but I am not sure that we do that. He would have us reach Him in every association with Himself, He would have us reach Him in the
{556}
mount of Olives position. He would have us reach Him in spirit. If we reach Him in the mount of Olives position we are beyond the rapture. The Ephesians are beyond, seated together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus; what could the rapture do for them? For this reason there is no mention of the rapture in that epistle.
I suppose verses 6 and 7 show us the process of instruction.
There is a special day known to Jehovah through which the remnant have to pass, and they reach light at eventide. It suggests that they do not reach the light in the mount of Olives position without going through a day of exercise.
Ques. What character of exercise? It says, "Not day, and not night".
C.A.C. It would be illustrated by the three days Saul of Tarsus went through when he neither ate nor drank and was without sight. He got the light. It came like a flash in one second. But the revolution produced in Saul's soul took three days and nights; it was mixed, he had not the Spirit. It was at the end of that time that he received the Spirit. It answers to what the disciples went through when the Shepherd was smitten; no one knows what they went through, what obscuration of all light there was when they saw the Shepherd smitten and He gave up the ghost on the cross. We should do well to ponder it. And if you look at it as one day, at even there is light. And we have to go that way to reach the heavenly position. We have to learn there is not a vestige of hope in the man after the flesh; even Christ after the flesh has to die. We have to go through it in principle.
Rem. We know not what is become of Him, they said of Moses.
C.A.C. They had lost sight of, and all interest in, the One ascended. It is just the history of the christian profession. Of course the remnant is bound up with Him.
Rem. 'Because I go away', the Lord said, 'ye have sorrow', "but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice".
{557}
C.A.C. At eventide it shall be light. It is very wonderful to see the harmony of God's ways. If you see the harmony of His ways, it corresponds universally with the remnant -- with the church. What light the remnant will get; they will see Christ in the Old and New Testaments from first to last, "and in the Psalms", and will come into conscious association with Him in the mount of Olives position and be ready to come back with Him to reign.
"Living waters shall go out from Jerusalem". From that point onward Jerusalem is seen as the city of the great King in her millennial glory, and all the earth is refreshed by the waters that flow out. All go out, as in @Revelation 22. The feast of tabernacles will be kept (verse 16), for every promise has been harvested and everything is gathered in, and holiness characterises everything. It is written on the bells of the horses; that is, natural strength takes on an entirely new character -- the character of holiness. All the pots and bowls are marked by holiness.
Rem. So the full thought of God is reached.
C.A.C. Yes, and gain to us as light is to be reached in the assembly, for all the spiritual thoughts of God as in the remnant are forecast in the assembly. We have our own vision of the heavenly Jerusalem in Revelation, but whether earthly or heavenly it is to impress us as to the character God would have put on His city. The assembly is His city today, marked by the supremacy of Christ and by holiness.

NOTES OF A READING
@Malachi 1: 1 - 14
Ques. Perhaps you would tell us the general purpose of this book?
C.A.C. It is the last testimony of Jehovah to Israel, giving the condition of the last days in hope that there would be recovery. Haggai and Zechariah, which we have looked at, would correspond in some extent with the letter to Philadelphia (@Revelation 3). This would rather go with Laodicea. I thought it was to be noticed that though a dark day and Jehovah had to say sorrowful things, yet His word is to Israel.
Rem. You mean not merely to Judah, but to the whole of Israel.
C.A.C. Actually a small remnant had come back from captivity, but they are addressed as Israel, showing that in the darkest day when things are most corrupted, God does not give up His thoughts.
Rem. So there is an overcomer too for Laodicea.
C.A.C. Quite so, and the letter is written to the angel in Laodicea. God lets no one off assembly responsibility. Israel was one whole under the eye of Jehovah, just as it was at the beginning. "Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel". It is Israel, not Judah, in chapter 4: 4. So God had the assembly before Him at the beginning and at the end, and there is not a single believer on the face of the earth exempted from assembly responsibility.
Rem. Having in view the light of His glory being great before the nations.
C.A.C. That is the form the assembly has taken now, is it
{562}
not? There are local assemblies "in every place", particularly in the gentile world.
Ques. What is the force of "The burden of the word of Jehovah to Israel"?
C.A.C. It is the word used by all the prophets, and particularly in Isaiah.
Ques. Is the thought that it is pressing, the prophets entering into God's feelings in regard to things?
C.A.C. I should think so.
Ques. What do you mean by saying no one is let off assembly responsibility?
C.A.C. Responsibility is always determined by the conditions and relations that God has established, is that not so?
God has been pleased to establish certain relations in His own sovereign love, and all saints are under responsibility to acknowledge the relations that God has established. It is the time of the assembly now, it is what God has established. If we recognise that is so and that God has nothing before Him but the assembly, we shall have nothing before us but the assembly. God does not recognise human systems. Every believer is responsible to recognise the assembly and that he is part of it.
Ques. Is the prophetic word designed to bring believers into the mind of God?
C.A.C. All that God does is intended to bring His people into His mind. He did not consult His people; He established things in His sovereign love, and by election and calling He has brought His people into those relations and responsibilities at the present time, and we are to recognise those principles and walk by them.
Ques. Would it apply to each of the seven phases of the assembly in Revelation?
C.A.C. God does not recognise anything but the assembly in its unity, or local assemblies; God gives no sanction to what man has set up. Divine teaching is needed and sometimes divine chastening to bring us to recognise what subsists,
{563}
but the assembly is a subsisting reality in virtue of the Spirit. The religious world is a denial of it, subsisting in human expedients, but God has not departed from His thoughts.
Ques. Did any one of the assemblies become a pattern of what you speak of?
C.A.C. Overcomers in each assembly show that it is a matter of exercise to enter into the mind of God. In the most favoured assembly we should need to be overcomers to enter into the divine relations. We have come to a time when things are being tested, and it is a question of whether we are giving satisfaction to God. No church position in itself will satisfy God. These people failed to satisfy Him. If we fail in this, it is a complete failure.
Rem. At the end of the book we have, "They that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another", etc.
C.A.C. Yes, and we see what pains he takes to refine Levi that He may get a pure offering -- an offering that will satisfy Himself. The remnant goes on and appears very distinctly in this book, but God has to deal with the general condition. It is to warn us, for we might be walking with the most spiritual persons on the earth and yet be failures. We must not relax in our diligent warfare.
Rem. In @2 Timothy 2 there is the individual first; you look after yourself first, and then you look after other people. You cannot judge other people until right yourself. A vessel of honour wants to keep company with other vessels of honour.
Ques. How is that done?
C.A.C. That means withdrawing from iniquity, fleeing youthful lusts, and following righteousness, faith, love and peace, with those that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. It is quite simple, but it takes some working out.
It is striking that Jehovah should begin. He was speaking to a people who were obdurate and insensible, and He begins by saying, "I have loved you". There is no more touching
{564}
word in Scripture. You get to Laodicea the valued words, "As many as I love". He speaks of His love, dreadful as their condition was.
Ques. Is it a mark of divine love?
C.A.C. We owe everything to God's love, everything we have. It is sovereign love -- the love of election. God set His love upon us when we were dead in trespasses and sins; it ought to appeal to us very much.
Rem. Malachi was the man with the message; how would he fit in today if this book is an indication of the Laodicean position?
C.A.C. Well, the Lord does not cease to speak to the assemblies even in that condition. The Spirit never ceases to speak to the assemblies.
Malachi means: "Messenger of Jah". It would fit in with a man with a message. Whatever we are or have is of God's sovereign love, it is of His calling. The apostle addresses the Corinthians on that ground. They were called, everything they had as an assembly they owed to the divine calling. If we realised God had called us in love to a certain position and service, we should be greatly interested to fill it to His satisfaction. Our approach to Him is to give Him satisfaction.
If God has established certain conditions in sovereign love, and if we realise that otherwise only certain perdition awaited us and that we owe everything to His sovereignty, it imposes a responsibility to approach God in a way that is satisfying to His love. If not, we have not realised it. The question is one of how we approach God. The tabernacle was set up and immediately the Lord God spoke out of the tabernacle as to the offerings. It is a necessity to God's love that we approach Him in a way satisfactory to Himself.
Rem. If sustained in His love it will always be a right offering.
C.A.C. The offering represents the offerer, a serious thing. If I do not bring an acceptable offering, it is because I am not right myself. Their offerings showed this insensibility to Jehovah's love.
{565}
Ques. Why is the question put, "Was not Esau Jacob's brother?"
C.A.C. I thought to bring out this great thought of God's sovereignty. Esau was passed by in divine sovereignty, he despised what had divine value.
Rem. I was wondering if it would indicate the special character of the love, love connected with choice -- a selective love in that way -- expressing in a way the special position that the saints have in God's love. It would affect us and cause response.
C.A.C. We have come under the sovereign love of God. We owe everything to that -- our place in the body, the house, the wife -- it is all a matter of the sovereign disposal of God's love. We had nothing to do with it. "Who has saved us, and has called us with a holy calling ... according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the ages of time" (@2 Timothy 1: 9). The more we enter into that, the more we should be qualified in offering. Our most intimate privilege is connected with priesthood, and is the first thing that fails -- and so here. God is not pleased with what is brought to Him today in christendom. If the place of blessing in Christ were understood, the things said would not be said.
Rem. It is not any mark on us, but it throws us back on our own worthlessness, so that it would be all Christ.
C.A.C. The only Man is Christ. The man who offers a pure offering, purifies himself, so he only offers Christ. God's thought is to have a pure oblation -- for all the assemblies everywhere to present a pure offering, so that God can be pleased with the offering and with the offerers. I think our offerings are always Himself. We cannot present to God anything that we are. We want to be freed from what is blind and lame and sick. Perfection is only found in what Christ is before God.
Rem. If we were acquainted with the presence of God, we should know better what is acceptable to God.
Rem. Esau is a profane person and is to perish forever.
{566}
C.A.C. Edom perishes altogether in judgment, he perishes absolutely. He is tested out before God hates him in the last book in the Old Testament, rightly marking that he was a subject of divine hatred. Edom is a touch that links with traditional christianity, which is without an atom of appreciation of Christ and will give up interest in Him for self-gratification.
Ques. Would it be challenging God's right?
C.A.C. @Romans 1 - 8 unfolds God's love and chapter 9 shows it all to be a matter of God's sovereignty. It is not because we received Christ that we got blessing. We must never get away from @Ephesians 2. It was when we were dead in offences and sins God quickened us. So the highest epistle is the lowest, is it not?
FROM C.A.C.S NOTEBOOK
@Malachi 1: 1 - 14
It is to be noted that Malachi's word is to Israel (chapter 1: 1), showing that in the mind of God His people are one whole at the end of the dispensation as they were at the beginning (chapter 4: 4). However small things may be and however corrupt, the people are addressed as "Israel". They have that place in the mind of God. In the New Testament, the assemblies in Corinth and Galatia, and the seven assemblies, God does not release any one from assembly responsibility: "All the assemblies shall know" (@Revelation 2: 23). "In the assembly". God will not give up His sovereign ordering of the assembly in virtue of the presence of the Spirit, and God does not sanction any human arrangements which are inconsistent with it. God does not recognise anything but the assembly.
It is surprising to us that the first thing Jehovah says is, "I have loved you". That is a matter of divine sovereignty.
{567}
He was going to deal with a most obdurate state of heart and departure of all kinds. But He begins with "I have loved you". Esau the despiser comes under judgment, but Jacob is loved. It is a question of God's election and calling. God has been pleased to call certain persons and to put them in His assembly. It is a fixed position and that is to determine all the conduct of the saints. All response depends on known relationships: our relationships as saints are fixed and unalterable: we have now to be true to these. God has loved us sovereignly and put us in certain relations. Then He may have to chasten us and admonish us and teach us to bring us into correspondence with the relations in which He has set us. How we have to do with God brings to light our true condition.
So we see here that the divinely established relations were not answered to. They were all established in sovereign love; then how sorrowful it is if they are not answered to. This is opened out in verses 6 - 10, and we find that the priests are the chief offenders. They despise Jehovah's name in offering polluted bread on His altar.
The offering service comes first in the mind of God (@Leviticus 1: 1). The first thing is what is due to God, "My bread" (@Numbers 28). Something was brought before God which is unworthy of Him, something which is not Christ: blind, lame and sick do not speak of Christ; they speak of man's selfishness and contempt of God. What the worshipper is comes out in what he offers: the "blind" refers to what is unintelligent, God has no pleasure in it. The lame and the sick speak of defects in the state of soul: they show that the offerer is wrong himself. We cannot offer beyond our own state of soul. If a brother is not walking well it is very important that others should make straight paths for their feet that the lame one may not be turned out of the way (@Hebrews 12: 13). People who are lame and sick cannot offer beyond their own state of soul.
In chapter 3 God has to rebuke those who did not bring the tithes, but in chapter 1 He rebukes those who would not do
{568}
anything unless they were paid. "All seek their own things" (@Philippians 2: 21).
But verse 11 gives the true thought: it seems almost intended to apply to the local assembly -- God's name great, incense and a pure oblation. We see from chapter 3 that this involves refining: there cannot be a pure oblation apart from the purifying of those who offer. The true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth, the living water taking the place of corrupted inward springs. We know the character of what springs up naturally.
FROM C.A.C.S NOTEBOOK
@Malachi 2: 1 - 17
Judah had married the daughter of a strange god. The wife of his youth in this connection, the wife of Judah's covenant, was the law of Jehovah. There must be faithfulness to the original and divinely appointed relationship. "And did not one make them?" (verse 15), I think refers to what God set up at the beginning of the dispensation: "Remember the law of Moses my servant" (chapter 4: 4).
"And the remnant of the Spirit was his", is a striking intimation, as it seems to me, that the Spirit would be faithful to what God had set up. It is the Spirit viewed as giving character to the dispensation, taking as it were remnant character as remaining true to what was originally ordained in a time of great departure. "And wherefore the one?" raises the question of what God had in mind in the original relation in which He set His people: "He sought a seed of God". Faithfulness to the bonds which God established at the beginning will secure this: the law governing the dispensation, whatever it is, must not be put away. God hates this and I think the Lord had this in mind in @Luke 16: 18. Now it is the glad tidings of the kingdom of God; that is, the moral sway of God as
{569}
known in grace. Christendom has dealt unfaithfully with the wife of her youth. They may cover the altar of Jehovah with tears; plenty of religious sentiment, but it is nauseous to Him. Romans and Galatians show the character of the dispensation, 1 Corinthians assembly responsibility, Hebrews the way of approach, Colossians and Ephesians the risen and heavenly position. But all this has been put away. It is an unfaithful *husband* because it is the responsible side, not the subjective side, which is here contemplated.
NOTES OF A READING
@Malachi 2: 1 - 17
C.A.C. The great gain of Scripture, as we have been noticing, is that we get in any part of it principles of present application, because there is a uniformity in the ways of God, so that what is true at one period is also true at another.
Ques. With regard to the pure oblation in chapter 1: 11, would it be found at the present time in the assembly of God's people?
C.A.C. Yes. No doubt it looks on to the coming time, but it is clearly anticipated in the assembly. It would apply to the local assemblies, do you not think? These things that come out here, come home to us; the prayer meeting -- the time of incense; the morning meeting -- pure oblation; and the ministry meeting in chapter 2.
Ques. Would you explain how it comes in chapter 2?
C.A.C. I meant the whole principle of ministry as committed to Levi, a ministry on God's part to His people. It says, "The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many away from iniquity. For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and at his mouth they seek the law; for he is the messenger of Jehovah of
{570}
hosts". It shows that God had in mind, and still has in mind, to have a ministry that will instruct and help His people.
Rem. There is the word of the Lord's commandment.
C.A.C. It is a kind of fixed principle in the mind of God. Their prayer is to be continued. Incense is connected with prayer in the psalm, as we all know. The oblation would be ministry to God such as should be and is found when the saints come together in assembly. We come together to minister to divine Persons.
Ques. To worship in spirit and truth -- would that be a pure offering?
C.A.C. I thought so. This service had failed in Israel and it has failed in the assembly, looking at it as a public body on the earth, but God has been and is working, that it might continue in an acceptable way. So incense goes up in prayers that are delightful to God.
Ques. Why are the priests addressed?
C.A.C. I suppose the breakdown is more serious with them than with anyone else. The nearer to God the place, the more serious it is if God's service is not carried out. He has a thought of putting the service right so as to get what he is seeking. "My name shall be great among the nations".
Rem. In chapter 1: 6 God charges them with having despised that Name. "Priests, that despise my name".
C.A.C. Well, we can see how little God's name is revered, speaking generally today; it is hardly known!
Ques. You apply priests to the saints as serving God in the intimacy of priests?
C.A.C. Yes, and that God's name should be known, as made known.
Ques. Is this just prior to the coming of the Lord?
C.A.C. Yes, only just a brief interval is left for God to secure what He has been seeking for nearly two thousand years. He has been seeking worshippers for the Father. His name as revealed is very little known. He has attracted His saints attention to the gospel of John for many years, God's name occurs there many times.
{571}
Rem. An indication that we are near the close.
C.A.C. So, it is wonderful to see God can be served exactly as He pleased. A pure oblation is something without any blemish.
Rem. The coming millennial glory will not be so great as what is before the saints now. They can be raised to the greatest thoughts of God now.
C.A.C. In the millennium there will not be the capacity to worship as there is now, there will not be the spirit of sonship. Their relations with God will be those of an earthly people. Is that not so? The great point now is that God has secured by His calling a heavenly people who know God as the Father in relation to what is heavenly. Notes of praise rise from the assembly higher than will rise in the millennium.
Rem. In Philippians we get those "who worship by the Spirit of God, and boast in Christ Jesus, and do not trust in flesh".
C.A.C. That is very wonderful, so the Spirit supports us as we take in the revelation that came out by the Son, and we can speak to God worthily as those who take in the great thoughts of God.
The worship of christendom is at a distance and is in darkness. The Father is not known, the heavenly position is not known, so that it is not a pure oblation, but carried on more in the character of sinners. God has come out in the full blessedness of His nature, and there is nothing to be added. As Father He gives His saints a place before Him that corresponds to that revelation, and as we enter into it we can offer a pure oblation.
Ques. Is it seen in Levi, "Jehovah ... let the work of his hands please thee" (@Deuteronomy 33: 11)?
C.A.C. Very beautifully. Levi has a twofold service; Godward in the incense and offering, and manward in instructing the people. If there is any sense of imperfection with us we cannot worship.
Rem. Levi fulfilled the conditions to secure this place.
{572}
C.A.C. Yes, he broke from all natural ties-from everything he was naturally. He knew not his father, his brethren or his own children. He broke loose entirely from what was natural, so had this great place of service. In this last book of the Old Testament God goes back to it. 'That is my ideal, I want that amongst my people'. It means now to be faithful to the light that has come to us from God.
The fact that the Lord spoke of worshipping in spirit and truth shows that the worshippers have entered another region altogether. There is not a shade on the revelation of the Father. We contemplate the One who is in the bosom of the Father, who has been in such blessed nearness that He reflects all in Him, and God is declared. God has found a way of setting aside all that we are in the flesh, so there is not a flaw, the worship is perfect. It is not a question of what I am as an individual. He has called me into absolute perfection and if I do not see that, I shall never worship. The service of praise is all occupied with Christ, it is all Christ. That is a pure oblation. Rejoicing in Christ Jesus and having no confidence in the flesh -- it is one of the most concise statements of what christianity is. So that to study the gospel of John in connection with the Father's name would make us worshippers. It would make us all worshippers if we went through the gospel of John on the knees of our hearts.
Rem. The question of condition in His people is raised and has to be judged (verse 14).
C.A.C. Yes, we have to be faithful to the divinely created relations in which God has set us, we must be faithful to those conditions -- that is what it means, all that He has to say as to the wife of Judah's youth -- conditions established by God at the beginning of the dispensation. The wife of youth is put away and there is a strange god. So we should be faithful to the relations established at the beginning of the dispensation. "And hath married the daughter of a strange god", so faithfulness now lies in preserving fidelity to those relations.
Rem. It is the question Paul raised in Corinthians when
{573}
he said, "I have espoused you unto one man", in pure affection.
C.A.C. Yes, and as in right relations among the brethren which have been divinely established, whether we have been faithful or not, whether as in the body or as living stones as in the assembly -- all established relations as set up at the beginning. And we must not put away the wife of our youth; it is what christendom has done. The wife of the covenant clearly refers to relations that God has established. It would help Christians immensely if they recognised that certain relationships have been established by God on earth, and every Christian is responsible to recognise them.
The assembly has a certain character impressed on it at the beginning; Christians had nothing to do with the setting up, with the character of the dispensation. The epistles to the Romans and the Corinthians lay down the character of the dispensation, and we have to be faithful to it, or we are putting away the wife of our youth. What we had at the beginning is the wife of our youth, and our responsible history and affections are to remain indelibly attached to it. Approach is set out in Hebrews, and our heavenly position, and you are to be faithful to it. God says, 'I will not have it put away'. We always need to be reminded of these things, even when we do know them. These Old Testament scriptures bring out in a striking way these great principles. If a man puts away his wife, he has changed his mind. So Paul had to say to the Galatians, "Who has bewitched you?" They had put away all the beautiful grace of God ministered to them and married the daughter of a strange god.
That is our great business in life, to learn what God set up at the beginning, and it is what our most intense affections ought to be bound up with -- those conditions that God set up at the beginning. They are worthy of all my love.
It takes in a very wide range of things. What held His people's affections at the beginning, God intends should hold them at the end. If not, we have done a dreadful thing. The
{574}
man is addressed here as responsible, as God deals with the responsible side. The feminine side refers to state. Here it is the male side, the responsible side is guilty. It all goes together of course, for if I give up these conditions in a practical sense, my state must be wrong.
Rem. Then I lose my happiness and shall not "Have joy with the wife of my youth".
C.A.C. That is very good indeed, I think that is what God intends us to learn. You cover the altar of the Lord with tears and weeping and crying out; that is religious sentiment, which is positively nauseous to God when found in people who have moved away from His original thoughts. God says then, 'I do not want your feelings and tears, I want to see you clinging fast to original conditions -- that will please Me'. All go together, the incense, the oblation and ministry, and faithfulness to established relations. They will all come into evidence. As to the prayers, there are some beautiful models given us of how to pray. It would be good to read the prayers of Paul before coming to the prayer meeting.
Ques. Why is she said to be "Thy companion"?
C.A.C. It means that all is to be kept by our side, near to us. It is God's design that there should be a seed of God. There will be a product if we hold fast to what is from the beginning. The covenant was for Israel, with us the wife of our youth covers the whole system of blessing brought in by Christ.
Rem. It says, "The remnant of the Spirit was his".
C.A.C. I think that is to remind us that the Spirit remains faithful to the original relation and goes right through with it, even if departed from. So the Spirit takes on a remnant character. The Spirit is going on with it whatever everybody else does, He is going through with the character of the dispensation. He is the Spirit of truth. He is never going to give up any precious thought of God, never going to deviate from what was set up at the beginning. And the ministry is never to deviate, "The law of truth was in his mouth ... for he is the messenger of Jehovah of hosts".
{575}
It is God's order of ministry, and it never deviates from the truth. What God feels most is our getting away from the affectionate conditions at the beginning. He feels it more than anything. Christendom has done this, and He will not accept any offering from people in a legal or carnal state. All these conditions are established in holiness; God has called us in holiness, and if we have got away from that character, we have got away from the character of the dispensation, away from holiness, away from grace and love; and all moral breakdown springs from getting away from grace and love.
FROM C.A.C.S NOTEBOOK
@Malachi 3:1 - 18
There is always, I believe, a preparation for the Lord, but when He comes He takes up things so that God may be served. The sermon on the mount is like a refiner's fire and like fullers lye. His sitting is a permanent position so long as the refining goes on. The addresses to the seven assemblies show Him as refining. It is the children of Levi: those responsible for the service. The refining process is in order that we may handle holy things in a holy way. An oblation in righteousness (verse 3): the oblation is generally the meat-offering but it seems extended here to the peace-offering, and perhaps other offerings. We can only bring what we have of Christ, but we must bring it as purified from all that is not Christ: being disciplined by the Lord is refining. "Let a man prove himself" is a similar thought. @Leviticus 9, @1 Chronicles 21: 26 would be the former years, the days of old.
The whole tithe is to be brought into the treasure house: @Numbers 18. The test is always present as to how far our affections are in practical activity with regard to the Lord's work. In a difficult day it is not so easy to find the Levites,

but we can always find one: the labourers are few. But we have to accept the principle that our spiritual prosperity depends, as @2 Corinthians 9: 6 expressly says, on our sowing: the spirit of blessing, and each according as he is purposed in his heart. But the levitical tithes are an obligation: they are part of the divine economy, an opportunity to show that we are concerned there shall be food in God's house. It is striking that there is nothing said in the New Testament about tithes, but @1 Corinthians 9 helps as to the principle of it.
When there is a lack of fruitfulness we might ask whether "the whole tithe" has been brought in.
NOTES OF A READING
@Malachi 3: 1 - 12
C.A.C. I suppose whatever the state of the people of God may be, until He definitely casts them off, he is always seeking access to their hearts.
Ques. Do we find that in Laodicea? "Behold, I stand at the door and am knocking".
C.A.C. Yes, I was thinking of that. Until the moment of final rejection we can count on the Lord's service of love to all those who are professedly His people. The state in which they are may require the Lord to take on a special character as we see here, a character of cleansing and refining. He is not exactly doing that in @John 13 - 17. If He washed their feet, it was a tender service of love, and it did not contemplate that they were in a bad condition. But when everything is out of order, and particularly when the service of God is out of order -- because that was the great calamity in this book -- the Lord has to come in as the Refiner and Purifier. But it is still the service of love, as He says to Laodicea, "I rebuke and discipline as many as I love".
{577}
Ques. Had the first verse a kind of fulfilment when He was here in the days of His flesh? They were making the house of God a place of merchandise.
C.A.C. Yes. I have often thought of the service when the Lord came to His temple; He saw plenty then in need of adjustment. It says He looked round upon all things. Well, He is doing that today. In the christian profession He sees almost everything to be in need of correction and purifying. I suppose that accounts for the character of a great deal of the Lord's ministry when here, because of the exposure of things here. A great deal of it had that character.
Ques. Why is the Angel of the covenant brought inhere? What do we learn by that?
C.A.C. Well, I suppose the Lord as the Mediator of the covenant might be spoken of as the Angel or Messenger.
Ques. Does it suggest His mediatorial place and service?
C.A.C. It rather, I think, suggests that he brought in the knowledge of God. All that God could make known of Himself was there in Jesus, but things being all wrong, the very declaration of God became a refining fire.
Ques. Do you understand this to be a warning of judgment to come? It seems connected with judgment. J.N.D.s footnote refers back to @Exodus 32: 34. The Angel that was to lead them would visit their sin upon them. Would it be an opportunity afforded for the people of God to get right with God?
C.A.C. Yes, the object directly in view is that the children of Levi may be purified to offer an oblation to Jehovah in righteousness. That is, if the Messenger of the covenant comes in, His first and chief thought would be that the service of God would be put right, and the refining would have that in view.
Rem. Yes. There are two portions to it. He would do this in an arbitrary way and the result of His judgment would be the purifying of Levi. All would be removed that was not according to His mind, and the rest would remain. It seems a
{578}
warning that it would come in punitively and so there is an opportunity to get right before.
C.A.C. I suppose this service is very like what the Lord is rendering to the seven assemblies. The address to them seems to have a refining character. The Lord is calling attention to what will not do for God. Five of them are characterised by the presence of things He greatly disapproves of.
The overcomer would profit by the refinement, so that what was disapproved of would be cast overboard, and the service of God would go on in purity.
Rem. He sent His Angel and the Jews refused Him, so a remnant is secured to carry on.
C.A.C. "Refiner's fire" and "fullers lye" -- both are very drastic measures of purifying and cleansing, and the love of Christ makes Him jealous and this severe process is necessary.
Rem. Chastening springs from divine love.
C.A.C. And we see at Corinth the refining fire there, that is a very clear example in the New Testament. It says in chapter 11: 28, 32, "But let a man prove himself, and thus eat of the bread, and drink of the cup ... that we may not be condemned with the world". That is the refiner, and the Lord looks that we should be in harmony with it. "Let a man prove". You put yourself to the test to see if there is any dross to go, and the Lord looks that we take on a service in correspondence with His service. People are sick now and even die under the Lord's refining process. "He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver". That is a position that He takes up and retains until the refining process is carried out. He is in it this minute, He is deliberately considering His ways of refining love and the effect they are having on me.
The children of Levi are those specially separated for the service of God and so must be refined. The Lord is absolutely intolerant of what interferes with the service of God, He will not put up with it. The service is looked upon as carried out effectively. "He will purify the children of Levi, and purge them". It is as if the Lord said, 'I will see this matter
{579}
through'. The object is that we should be prepared to handle holy things in a holy way. The most holy things have been put in our hands; it is a matter of offering an oblation. Oblation is a general term: it is extended to the peace-offering here and perhaps other offerings (it is really the meat-offering), so that it comes with ourselves, all is offered to God. It is Christ, of course.
Rem. It sets out the highest form of service, the highest privilege of remnant days just before the Lord comes.
C.A.C. Yes. We cannot bring what we do not have. It says, "They shall offer unto Jehovah an oblation in righteousness". I think the point of it is that the offerer must be in keeping with the offering. We have nothing to offer but Christ, but God's pleasure depends on what I am. If the person is altogether out of harmony with what he brings, God has not pleasure in it.
The refining process is most necessary, having in view bringing us into correspondence with Christ, and our business is to be in correspondence. John says, "Every one that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as he is pure" (@1 John 3: 3). That is just the normal action of purifying in the saints.
Rem. In @Exodus 19: 22, the priests hallow themselves. "And the priests also, who come near to Jehovah, shall hallow themselves".
C.A.C. Yes, so it supposes this priestly exercise goes on every time we eat the Lord's supper; we put ourselves through a searching enquiry. It is the normal exercise of the saints.
Ques. Is it eating unleavened bread?
C.A.C. Yes; @1 Corinthians 5: 7 says, "Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, according as ye are unleavened. For also our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed". In a certain sense the saints are viewed as unleavened, but then we must be practically so. No upright person would care to have it otherwise.
Rem. It is a matter of righteousness.
{580}
C.A.C. It is what is right, it is nothing arbitrary. If I bring Christ to God, I should correspond with Christ. If I speak to God of One meek and lowly in heart, and I am just the opposite, how could that be? We through self-judgment refine ourselves from those things that are not like Christ, so the saints are being refined all the time until our deathbed.
Rem. The refiner watches until he sees his image in the molten metal.
C.A.C. Until there is not a speck left to mar the image. That is what the Lord has in mind for us all, though the process is quicker with some than others.
Rem. It has been said that discipline is according to our temperament -- Paul's and Peter's were different.
C.A.C. I think so.
Ques. Does @John 15 compare with this?
C.A.C. "Every one bearing fruit, he purges it". It is the fruitfulness of the vine that attracts the Father's attention; it is not exactly a question of correction.
Rem. The end in view is a very high standard.
C.A.C. Well, it must be so if people are called in infinite love to be near to God. You would not like to think that God was not particular. Every saint must correspond with Christ.
I have no doubt that all the present difficulties and trials and pressure on the saints are the refining process, in order that the service of God should be carried on in a much more holy way than ever before. So He refers here to the "days of old".
Rem. Jehovah said, "I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness" (@Jeremiah 2: 2).
C.A.C. As when Aaron offered the burnt-offering and fire came out and burnt it up (@Leviticus 10). It was such an offering that God could publicly acknowledge it. So with David at the threshing-floor of Ornan, fire came down upon the altar. There was something about David's exercises which brought it down. There was something in David pleasing to God (@1 Chronicles 21: 26). So with Manoah's offering, the Angel did wondrously (@Judges 13: 19). We should look for a sense that
{581}
the blessed God has accepted with pleasure what we have brought. Cain's offering was not! Has God accepted it with pleasure? We should not be content with anything else. I would not like God to be pleased with what I bring, if I am out of harmony with it.
A RESULT FOR GOD
@Malachi 1: 11; @Malachi 3: 1 - 4
I feel encouraged to refer to the book of Malachi in connection with this most important subject of a result for God. The question raised in the book of Malachi at the end of the dispensation is whether the conditions with which it began are maintained. The great proposal in the covenant was that there should be a kingdom of priests. God had sonship in mind as underlying priesthood, and he would have it to mark the whole of His people so that a great result might be secured for Himself. The dispensation had run through, and at the end Malachi raised again the question of a result for God.
The three post-captivity prophets have each their own line. Haggai dwells on the house, Zechariah on the conditions on which the house can be built and maintained; but Malachi assumes that the house is built, and he raises the question of the moral state of the priesthood as essential to the offering of a pure oblation. We have reached something similar in our day; God has recovered the truth of the house, but the house requires a purified priesthood. Malachi addresses himself very definitely to the priesthood, and to the unhappy state in which it was found. In chapter 1 the result for God is most deplorable; the people are addressed as persons who despised God's name, and who said that His table was contemptible. They were offering the blind and the lame and the sick, and God indicates his great displeasure.
In the offerings generally it is not so much a question of what Christ is in Himself, but of what He is in the apprehension
{582}
of the offerer. None can yield a pure result for God's pleasure apart from spiritual state. The exercise comes home very closely as to what capacity we have to offer; what we bring indicates where we are. A blind offering indicates lack of intelligence in what we bring to God. I fear we are not altogether free from defects of this kind. Then offering the lame for sacrifice typifies the activity of one whose walk is not in keeping with what he says; all he says is lame, and it is displeasing to God. The sick would be something professedly brought to God when we are ourselves in poor spiritual health, very low spiritual vitality. How can it yield pleasure to God?
God says, "From the rising of the sun even unto its setting my name shall be great among the nations; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure oblation: for my name shall be great among the nations, saith Jehovah of hosts". No verse in the Old Testament applies more to the present time; we may apply it to the gatherings in various localities. What is in view is that there may be a result for God that is according to His own mind. We pray much, I trust, that there may be great increase in the quality and quantity of what is offered to God. This depends on God's name being great amongst us. The Lord's great service is to make God great among us. He said, "I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known". I feel we very much need a deepened sense of the greatness of God. The basis of the whole principle of offering is a great sense of the greatness of God. I feel the need of it in my own soul, and think I can say I pray almost daily for an increased sense of *the greatness of God*.
The main subject of the earliest book of the Bible, the book of Job (probably written long before the books of Moses) was to show that the greatness of God must be apprehended in the soul if our relations to Him are to be suitable. A man may be ever so pious, and yet break down because he has not an adequate sense of the greatness of
{583}
God. The helpful chapters at the end of that book are all on the line of making God great. When Job got a view of the greatness of God he thought rightly of himself, and he was accepted. He had brought offerings in the first chapter, but there must have been defect in them, because we cannot bring to God anything that exceeds our sense of the greatness of God.
The Lord Jesus at the end of the dispensation is introduced as coming to His temple -- "The Lord whom ye seek will suddenly come to his temple, and the Angel of the covenant, whom ye delight in" (@Malachi 3: 1). This is not His coming in a public way; *that* is referred to in chapter 4: "Unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings". But before that He comes in a *private* way to His temple and as the Angel of the covenant.
He enforces in the priesthood the moral conditions that are suitable to God. "He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and he will purify the children of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver". He is bent on a pure result -- pure oblation -- so He puts the priesthood through a refining process. What He is doing at the present time answers to this. The Angel of the covenant has *come*, and He has come as a Refiner. This is most encouraging, because it shows there is something there of value. There is great potential value in the brethren. There may be an admixture of dross, but if there were not some gold or silver He would not sit as a Refiner. There is the possibility of a great result for God -- a pure oblation -- that God may have the portion at the end of the dispensation which was in His mind from the outset. Now we are in the hand of the blessed Refiner; *He* knows what is hindering the fifth part being offered to God. He has come to His temple in order to purify the priesthood that there may be a pure oblation. We have all heard unlimited ministry, we have read the Scriptures, and we have a good deal of knowledge, but there is no result for God in that alone. A pure result for God lies in spiritual purification. We would desire
{584}
that there might be a result that is in keeping with His greatness. "My name shall be great". Not that we can ever rise to the full measure of which He is worthy; the most He looks for is the "fifth part", which is all the creature is capable of giving. Silver speaks of redemption, and gold of the work of God in His people. On this line there is something God can purify, to bring about a pure result.
May we be more capable, through His favour, of yielding this pure result for the pleasure of God.
