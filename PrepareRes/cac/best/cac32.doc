NOTES OF A READING @1 CORINTHIANS 1: 1 - 9
C.A.C. This epistle is important for us, as giving the place the assembly has locally in the mind of God, and the great grace available for it in Christ. It also develops the dangers apt to manifest themselves, and the divine remedy for them. The object of the epistle is really to bring the saints locally into oneness of mind, and the joy of all that grace has conferred upon them as subjects of the work of God. This epistle is serviceable in a day of departure.
Paul had in view in writing it that we should be put in our right place locally. Actually in christendom a vast number of things have sprung up that have not the character of the assembly of God, and we have to go back to the beginning to find its true character. "Sanctified in Christ Jesus" -- that is not by being Jews, or better than before, but sanctified in Christ Jesus. God had certain great thoughts in His mind before we were converted (see @Psalm 40: 5). We have to get on to that side of things, what is in the mind of God for us; and however wonderful it is, Christ came in to bring it to pass. Saints are set apart from everything displeasing to God. If it got hold of us, it would have a most practical effect. This is built into our faith by the words of the apostle; and if I have never understood it before, it is there for me now. We are not set apart in the flesh, but in Christ Jesus.
Rem. Outside all the Adam conditions.
C.A.C. The youngest believer can say, I am in it, it is the mind of God for me. "Of him" (that is, God) "are *ye* in Christ Jesus" (@1 Corinthians 1: 30) -- as a subject of divine working, the soul is brought into a new region, "in Christ Jesus". So the youngest believer is entitled to say, I am pleasing to God. It is God bringing in what is of Himself. If not walking in the Spirit I am sure to drop into human thoughts.
{4}
If I am full of Christ and what Christ has brought in, I cannot think of myself at all, and I am suitable to be a constituent part of the assembly.
Rem. "In Christ Jesus" -- it is the anointed Christ; they are linked up with that anointed Man.
C.A.C. It is the question of transfer, of 'changing your man', as it has been put. And we are in that Man; what I have of failure would only make me more thankful that I am linked up with the Man of God's pleasure.
Romans develops deliverance much more than this epistle. Here they allowed things to come in that did not belong to the work of God in us, and we have to learn to set them aside; and we come into the truth by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is descriptive of a Christian in Scripture. In every place there are such; they call on Him in the character in which He has made Himself known. That is not praying. "His name" is the way in which He has made Himself known. It is made known in the gospels, we might say, which present the varied characters of love He has assumed on behalf of His saints. Our knowledge of Christ comes out in how we call upon Him. The first part of our morning meeting consists in calling on His name; and we know Him first of all and most of all through His death. They call upon Him in their heart. They call upon Him not dependently, but worshipfully, as men called upon the name of Jehovah in contrast to all that was idolatrous. Abraham made an altar and called upon the name of Jehovah, in the character in which he knew God. So we call upon His name, responding in heart to the character in which we know Him, in absolute liberty. We lose ourselves when we do that. The varied characters of love which He delights to wear and in which He delights to serve us are all set forth in His name. We come together to call adoringly on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and all that it means.
Spiritual affections and appreciations of Christ are in the
{5}
saints; they cannot help it. However carnal I am, the Spirit of God can touch these, and there is the flow. So we should detach ourselves from the world and the flesh and occupy ourselves with Christ and all that is of Him. We may hear one pray beautiful words to the Lord, but is it the voice of the heart? "Those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart" (@2 Timothy 2: 22); "out of a pure heart" means it is genuine. Do they appreciate the Lord in true affection? The Lord would never bring anyone to a sect! It never occurred to God to make anything of my flesh, but to annul all that. "Sanctified in Christ Jesus" is God's side; then in calling on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we link ourselves on to that. It is the proper and normal occupation of the assembly.
Nothing is so intended to touch our hearts as the Supper. You cannot think of yourself at the Lord's supper, you are obliged to think of Him.
God bestows all in the grace of the Head; for there is none of us but would confess we have a glorious Head. And these things are continually brought before the saints. God sees to it that there is the furnishing through gifts and ministry of the light of all the precious thoughts of God. At Corinth the gifts were there, but they needed trimming. But the Lord on His part would not fail to supply what is needed. If we recognise a lack locally, we should ask for it to be met. We should ask for things. Epaphras was labouring that the body should function (@Colossians 4: 12). If we were more concerned about contributing, we should get more. How has God furnished His assembly, and how has Christ as Head furnished it, and how has the Spirit furnished it? We look to the Scripture for the answer, and we set ourselves to desire that, and we get it!
This epistle is corrective meal and would neutralise what is deadly in the pot (@2 Kings 4: 41).

NOTES OF A READING @1 CORINTHIANS 1: 4 - 21
C.A.C. An assembly is a place where speaking goes on; political speaking goes on in a Greek assembly, and religious speaking in a synagogue.
The assembly is a company of persons in each locality where there is divine speaking, where the things of God are spoken of in a suitable manner. That is what the apostle dwells on in the early verses in this chapter (verses 4 - 7); that is, they were fully furnished for divine speaking. It is not a company marked by silence, but by speaking, according to the resources provided, the grace in Christ Jesus that qualified them. Speaking supposes intelligence in both speaker and hearer. The "oracles" connect very much with it; if a man cannot speak as having the mind of God he should be silent in the assembly.
In these verses you get the constitution of the assembly, and what qualifies it to function. It functions in virtue of the grace that God has given it in Christ Jesus; it provides for everything in the assembly. He is bringing it out to people who badly needed it (and *we* badly need it); they had quite got away from the constitution, for there were divisions and so on. It is a wonderful source of supply -- "word", "knowledge", "testimony" -- and all is to find expression in the assembly in a divine way. Is what is said really being said from a divine source, from the grace that is in Christ Jesus? Then some are too backward. Why cannot I speak in the assembly? Is there a shortage? Has God set the assembly going without sufficient to carry it on? Why cannot I have a supply from the Head? There is to be no exaltation of man in what is said, or in the way it is said. It is a new kind of speaking which carries the grace of a new kind of Man -- not Adam at all. Every brother should look for ability to draw from this resource. What I can do
{7}
personally is not worth a straw, but what I can do in the grace that is in Christ Jesus is the only thing that counts.
Rem. The apostle asks for prayer "in order that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth to make known with boldness the mystery of the glad tidings, for which I am an ambassador bound with a chain, that I may be bold in it as I ought to speak" (@Ephesians 6: 19, 20).
C.A.C. Beautiful! A man, an unbeliever, came home to his wife from a meeting, shaking like an aspen leaf. All he could say was, 'I only know that God is in that place'. He did not know he was quoting Scripture (See @1 Corinthians 14: 24, 25). Well, that is the character of the assembly of God. And all has in view that we are so confirmed in Christ that if we knew the Lord Jesus Christ was going to appear in five minutes, nothing would need altering, but be just as it should be.
Ques. What is the difference between "the testimony of the Christ" here (verse 6) and "the testimony of God" (chapter 2: 1)?
C.A.C. Just the difference between Man and God. The first is the anointed Man, the second the preaching of the glad tidings making known what God is to men. "The testimony of the Christ has been confirmed in you" means the thing is confirmed that God has brought in a new order of Man. That is confirmed; the assembly should be a testimony to a new order of Man.
Rem. It needs a counterpart in the assembly, in that way.
C.A.C. What good is it for me to say that God has brought in another Man, if people cannot see a trace of that Man in me!
Rem. Adjustment to the constitution would keep us right.
Ques. How would you explain the constitution?
C.A.C. Everything has a new character as deriving from Christ; and there is provision for it to be made known;
{8}
and it results in it becoming a reality. We want to be in the reality, the grace of it, and that leads to the fellowship in a practical sense. Saints have been so affected by the influence of the assembly that there is not a spot on them in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is wonderful! The apostle is writing that it may be practically true. All this forms the fellowship. The saints are brought into a wealth in which they all have a common share.
Ques. Why "of his Son" (verse 9)?
C.A.C. It is to give the highest possible touch to it, it is of such an elevated character. We are called by God in His faithfulness to have a common share in what has come in by His Son. It, the fellowship, is greater than the exercise of gift. There are four aspects of it. There is the fellowship of the body and of the blood of Christ, and of the Holy Spirit; but the greatest of all is the fellowship of God's Son. There is nothing greater than what God has set forth in His beloved Son. "When God ... was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations" (@Galatians 1: 15, 16). It is the greatest thing God has to speak of; it is the greatest glory of the gospel, because it is "concerning his Son ... Jesus Christ our Lord" (@Romans 1: 3, 4). It is opened out in the assembly. Fancy having a common share with Paul and John; they had a share in it. It is exclusive of all he goes on to speak of. Then "Jesus Christ our Lord" -- we confess we have come under His control. We continually need Him as such so that we are commanded for the blessing; and only so do we really come into the blessing. First He commands the blessing, and then us for the blessing. We are not fit personally to say one word in the assembly. But what is God working for? That the assembly should be marked by divine speaking; God is faithful. Verse 10 would seem an impossibility; but God likes to deal in impossibilities! If we move according to the constitution we shall find it impossible to be otherwise. He does not stress the Spirit here, but the kind of
{9}
speaking is to be according to the new kind of Man. Is it not a lovely conception? It works out universally.
The character of all this epistle is that it is the Lord's commandment. If we think of Moses as a type in the Old Testament, there was a beautiful unity when they were building the tabernacle, so that the whole thing was seen in its completeness.
If we have favourite teachers we may miss the greatest possible blessing. "I of Christ" (verse 12) would be pretension to the highest possible level -- the worst party of all. J.N.D. said he would never go with a party, whether for the truth or against it, whether good or bad. The name of the Lord Jesus Christ is the great lever and is to govern us. "Has Paul been crucified for you?" (verse 13). The assembly is formed of persons who cherish the thought of the whole assembly. "With those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart" (@2 Timothy 2: 22). You cannot have a party on that line!
It is good for us to remember to what we have been baptised. @Matthew 28 is the greatest thought of baptism: the nations baptised "to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit". Baptism connects us with divine Persons. The baptism of the feeblest saint is as great as the baptism of Paul. But what are we baptised to? To Christ and His death. Paul said, "Christ has not sent me to baptise" (verse 17). It was not in his commission, but it was in that of the twelve. That is important, because it puts baptism in its proper place. Paul had to do rather with the heavenly. Baptism is for earth; it is connected with the kingdom rather than with the assembly. It gives a certain side of privilege, but gives no title to heaven. The thief on the cross did not need to be baptised, he was going directly to heaven. But if he had been reprieved, he would have had to be baptised to enter the assembly.
Rem. The glad tidings bring you to heaven.
C.A.C. Yes, in the fulness of them they bring people to heaven.

NOTES OF A READING @1 CORINTHIANS 1: 17, 18, 21 - 24; @1 CORINTHIANS 2: l-5
C.A.C. It was thought that in considering together the precious subject of the Lord's supper we should first of all get some idea of the kind of persons who can eat the Supper. The thought, therefore, is to see how these people at Corinth came to be the assembly of God, and the features that marked them as the assembly of God. It is clear that the Lord's supper has its place in the assembly of God, and to understand it we must necessarily be acquainted with the character of the assembly.
Rem. I was wondering whether the two verses in early Acts would give the thought. "Those then who had accepted his word were baptised; and there were added in that day about three thousand souls. And they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers" (@Acts 2: 41, 42). They give the setting of those whom we have in view at the present time.
C.A.C. Yes, the same character of things evidently took place at Corinth. The testimony corresponded with that rendered by Peter at Jerusalem. His testimony was that "God has made him, this Jesus whom *ye* have crucified, both Lord and Christ". That was the announcement which promptly affected them. Likewise at Corinth (@Acts 18) Paul announced to them in the synagogue that Jesus was the Christ. It is well for us to understand that that is the very essence of the assembly position, it is composed of persons who believe the testimony that Jesus is the Christ.
Ques. Do you get that in the opening verses in Corinthians? Paul refers a good many times there to "our Lord Jesus Christ".
C.A.C. Yes, it is important to look at these things from the standpoint of divine testimony. It is not a question of our personal experience or needs at all, but it is a
{11}
question of a Person to whom God has given testimony that He is the anointed One; He is the Christ, God's Anointed. It is the testimony apart from all feeling or experience that I or anybody else may have.
Rem. "According as the testimony of the Christ has been confirmed in you" (verse 6).
C.A.C. He refers to it further on: "I came to you ... announcing to you the testimony of God". It is summed up in "Jesus Christ, and *him* crucified". We cannot be too simple in regard to it, yet it is most profound because of its stupendous reality. We just believe the testimony. It certainly must come to us as the testimony of God and if we receive that testimony it would result in our identifying ourselves with the Person who is the subject of testimony; and those who do so form the assembly in a place.
Ques. Will you say what the testimony of the Christ involves?
C.A.C. It is most important to understand that. The testimony is that there is such a Person as God's Anointed. There are many prophetic references to Him in the Old Testament, but the testimony now comes to us that Jesus is that Person, that anointed Man of whom the Old Testament spoke. The thought of being God's Anointed means that He is the Man whom God distinguishes and accredits, and we cannot believe that without being powerfully affected. It is the first thing we come to when we have to do with God; we must accept that He is God's Anointed.
Rem. It was said of Simeon that "it was divinely communicated to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death before he should see the Lord's Christ" (@Luke 2: 26).
C.A.C. That is the whole thing. Jesus claimed to be the Anointed when He stood up in the synagogue at Nazareth (@Luke 4: 18 - 21), and His whole life was the evidence of the fact. I think Paul gave that evidence at Corinth for he "reasoned" with them. It was a matter of careful proof that Jesus was the Anointed.
{12}
Rem. The main theme of the first preaching was that God had made Him "both Lord and Christ".
C.A.C. This lies at the very basis of the formation of the assembly; you have no company to take the Supper otherwise. It is all a question of believing God's testimony, and His testimony is Jesus. It clears the ground at once. Corinth was full of idols and there were schools of philosophy and a synagogue of Jews, but none of these things had been anointed by God. He had put no distinction on any of them. He had put distinction on Jesus. These things are in a sense simple, but they are immense in moral power and significance. God is distinguishing one Man, He is testifying that Jesus is the anointed Man. It is no question of our exercises at all.
Ques. Is there a separating power in it?
C.A.C. Yes, I do not want to go on with anything that God has not anointed. God has shown me a Man who has been anointed. He stands alone -- it carries with it a separating power. This is a thing that can be reasoned out and Paul shows there is unquestionable evidence that Jesus is God's anointed Man. If people do not believe it they do not believe God's testimony. It was all developed in the life and testimony of Jesus, all was an undeniable proof. "Jesus who was of Nazareth: how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power; who went through all quarters doing good, and healing all that were under the power of the devil, because God was with him" (@Acts 10: 38). Now God is still submitting the evidence of it to men, and they are responsible to form their own judgment regarding it.
Rem. God has raised Him.
Ques. Why is it that he stresses the crucifixion?
C.A.C. Because the princes of this world had crucified the Lord. The testimony was all there before their eyes. They did not call the blind man of @John 9 or Mary Magdalene as witnesses. They did not call any worth hearing.
{13}
Rem. It says, "None of the princes of this age knew, (for had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory)" (@1 Corinthians 2: 8).
C.A.C. It shows their blindness. It is just to bring out the utter incapacity of men to receive the testimony of God. So there must be certain persons who are called, and to them Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God, but He is to the Jews a stumbling-block and to the Greeks foolishness.
Rem. Man after the flesh cannot appreciate Christ.
C.A.C. That is the whole thing, so the belief that Christ is God's anointed Man really delivers the soul from every other kind of man. That is the kind of man God distinguishes and accredits. A distinct issue was raised that none of us can avoid. The mass of men do not believe that He is the Christ, the fact that some do makes a sharp line of demarcation, and every believer feels that he must be baptised and take his stand with Christ, or be with the world that crucified Him. It is a clear-cut issue.
The anointing brings out the moral character attaching to Jesus. There was not a single thing about Him that God was not pleased to distinguish; He loved to put distinction on that Man.
Rem. I was wondering whether it went back to the breakdown in Eden. It is a necessity that One who pleases God should come into evidence, and that is the One to whom God is looking.
C.A.C. Yes, that is it. There is a perfect testimony in that blessed Man to all that God is morally. Does that attract me? Do I believe this testimony? If so, I have finished with the world as a system.
We find how very soon there is a sense even in a child of being naughty, very early there is a sense of not being pleasing to God, even at two or three years old! This wonderful testimony comes concerning Jesus -- there is everything in Him for God's delight. If I believe that, I
{14}
must stand by it.
Rem. We see it in the first two Psalms. God can anoint the Man in @Psalm 2 who pleases Him in @Psalm 1.
C.A.C. Yes. This is the supreme question of all time. There is one Man whom God has signalised and accredited, and every other man is discredited. If persons believe that, they are fit for the assembly. It is a question of whether I have believed the testimony. It is what I believe, not a matter of experience or formation.
After the preaching that God had made Jesus "both Lord and Christ", they recognised what an awful state the world was in and said, We must get clear of it! If I have really believed the testimony of God's Anointed, I have finished with the world. The world is after money and gain and pleasure. There is not a single thing that God has anointed in it. If there is one divine spark in my soul I am attracted to Jesus. Then I accept baptism, I have finished with the world -- that is what baptism means.
This is the kind of company who can eat the Supper: persons who have believed the testimony that Jesus is the Christ, the anointed Man.
Ques. When did this anointing take place?
C.A.C. It took place at His baptism, which was the public accrediting of that Man.
Rem. I suppose we need to see the beauty of His deeds and Person and the immediate effect of what the world has done, and these would help us to have done with the world.
C.A.C. So that all things are exposed. The princes of the world are exposed; they crucified Him, they are exposed. How could I go on with politics and such things if I believe that Christ is God's Anointed? The assembly is made up of people who have judged these things.
Rem. It involves His coming into His rights down here.
C.A.C. Yes, it must involve that, because the One
{15}
whom God has anointed must have the supreme place. God has not adjusted things yet, but when God adjusts everything in the universe He will have that place. What you feel is He ought to fill the scene -- the universe. He is capable of filling it, we all ought to have that sense.
Ques. Would you say that if we are in the good of God's testimony, the Lord's pathway traced through this scene has a different bearing altogether?
C.A.C. Yes, and then, of course, His being crucified brings in another element, because if I accredit the Man whom God has accredited, there is another man who is the direct opposite. That is the best way of learning *self*. The proper way of learning self is to learn Christ first. It is reached by believing divine testimony, not on the line of my exercises. We see God expressed there; and everything that is pleasing to Him is all there in that Man and not in a world of learning and pride.
Ques. Will you say why it is the cross here and not the death of Christ?
C.A.C. We learn the necessity to value the cross, because if I really accept Christ as the Anointed of God and contemplate His character in the gospels, I begin to feel I am not like Him. He is everything that is desirable, but I am just the opposite -- that is where the cross comes in. The cross is a judicial matter, it was intended to be so by the princes of this world. Their judiciary sentence pronounced that Jesus ought to be subjected to the utmost degradation. From the divine side we know God would never have let them crucify Him if He had not something else in mind, that is judicially to expose what in us is not in correspondence with Christ. It is exposed publicly for He suffered on the cross what was due to me. He suffered for it, that is God's side of it. Everything about me deserved to be nailed to that cross; if I believe that I should never want to lift up my head again. God has been pleased to set forth in the most beautiful Man the condemnation of the degraded man -
{16}
what I am. Every one who comes into the assembly comes in in the light of that, and cannot come in otherwise. It is a wonderful company clothed in white raiment in a world of persons in black garments who do not believe God's testimony.
Rem. "God has made him, this Jesus whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ".
C.A.C. It was to mark in the strongest possible way the contrast between those that crucified Him and the place that God has given Him. He fills it gloriously and He fills it efficiently; we come together in the light of that. This is really the basis on which the assembly of God stands; when once it gets into the soul you cannot get away from it.
We should be reminded of one thing, that faith cannot be maintained in its integrity without the Spirit, and that is why Christians today are in such a lamentable state. At some point in their history they have come to this and they have drifted from it. How is it to be maintained? Only by the Holy Spirit. Christians are often not in the grace and power of it because they are not keeping in the company of the Holy Spirit. I am sure that we have all come to the faith of it. God is committed to that Man and we have committed ourselves to that Man and to His name and His company, but the maintaining power of it is the Spirit. If I do not keep company with the Spirit I wane in my soul. He is the power of things, and the Spirit never deviates from Christ. I may often do so, but I should be kept steady if I kept in the company of the Spirit.
{17}
SPIRITUAL SPEAKING
@1 Corinthians 2: 12, 13; @Ecclesiastes 12: 9 - 11
The present period is a dispensation of speaking. It is marked by the Father speaking, and the Son speaking, and the Holy Spirit speaking; and spiritual persons are speaking, too, as we have been reminded this evening from @Malachi 3: 16. We have been reading lately of the treasures of the house of God, and we have had before us now how wisdom fills the treasuries of those who love her.
It is of deep interest to consider that divine treasures take intelligible form by being expressed in words. We are capable of receiving and communicating divine things by means of words, and our intelligent bond with one another is realised as we speak one to another. It may, of course, be truly said that the Lord and the Spirit are our bond, but there is no *intelligent* bond unless spiritual things are communicated in words. Peter said to the Lord, on behalf of the twelve, "Thou hast words of life eternal" (@John 6: 68). Those words, those particular communications, were the link between the Lord and them.
The speaking of the apostle, as referred to in @1 Corinthians 2: 13, was in "words ... taught by the Spirit", and his service was marked by "communicating spiritual things by spiritual means". The words taught by the Spirit were inspired words, and we do not claim to use Spirit-taught words in that sense, but we should seek in our speaking to one another to use words that are rightly expressive of the mind of the Spirit. By such communications we can have intelligent links with each other, and come into contact with the work of God in each other's souls. That can only be brought about by means of words being spoken and heard.
In connection with this subject it is well to observe the method of the Preacher in Ecclesiastes, for he was a model
{18}
speaker. He was "wise", and he "pondered", and he "sought to find out acceptable words". We are often too casual and haphazard in our speaking to one another. It would be well if our speaking were more the outcome of what we have "pondered". It would thus take on more of the character of "the words of the wise", of which we are told that they are "as goads". Words which stimulate movement are truly valuable, and the collections of them are "as nails fastened in: they are given from one shepherd". It should be our business to collect as many of "the words of the wise" as we can, not merely as having them in our notebooks, but as having them "as nails fastened in". That is, they are driven right home, and have a fixed and permanent place in our souls. Let us consider whether our speaking is like this, whether it comes to others with stimulating power, and is so fastened in that it cannot be got out again. Nails truly fastened in remain permanently as part of our structure, if we may so speak.
In this way the work of the Lord would be promoted and developed amongst us. That work is largely accomplished by means of speaking. Our words are to be "acceptable"; they are not to be raw or immature. Our speaking to one another is important, for much depends upon it. Either it binds together, or it tends to disintegrate. Divine Persons have spoken so that we might take on the same character of speaking. It was so in the case of the apostles who learnt from Christ, who, indeed, uttered "acceptable words", learning from His Father every morning "how to succour by a word him that is weary". What a Model He is for us! In @Luke 4 how carefully He found the words that were precisely suitable for the occasion! It is true that His words were rejected, and therefore we need not be surprised if our words are rejected; but let us see to it that they are "always with grace, seasoned with salt" (@Colossians 4: 6).
There is a particular sense in which these meetings for ministry are a revival of spiritual speaking. If prophetic
{19}
ministry had continued in the church it would have been a great check upon incoming evil. It would have been an effectual barrier to the setting up of the clerical principle. Probably the giving up of meetings such as are spoken of in @1 Corinthians 14 was one of the first proofs of assembly decline, and it opened the way for man to have a voice in the assembly rather than God. Now that they are revived again it is for us to continue in exercise that the speaking is really in the power of the Spirit of God. "Goads" are not spiritual commonplaces; they are words which make it necessary to move forward. And "nails fastened in" are words "given from one shepherd"; they come from the Lord, and remain fixed in the soul.

NOTES OF A READING @1 CORINTHIANS 3: 16, 17; @1 CORINTHIANS 5: 6 - 8
C.A.C. We were reading last Lord's Day that these persons who are addressed as the assembly of God in Corinth were persons who had believed the testimony of the Christ -- that Jesus is the Christ, that Jesus is God's anointed Man. What we had before us was that if Jesus was the Man whom God could accredit and distinguish, this necessarily involved the setting aside of every other man. That was judicially brought about at the cross, so that "Jesus Christ, and *him* crucified" really implies the testimony of God, and it was declared in Corinth.
Rem. This would be foundational and it would be illustrated in the Ethiopian eunuch who wanted to be baptised. That is, it is soul work.
C.A.C. Yes, he believed the testimony and it was testimony of "some other". His question was, "Concerning whom does the prophet say this? of himself or of some other?" The Ethiopian had some inkling in his soul of some other man. And Philip preached unto him Jesus, *He* was the other Man! Immediately he wished to be baptised. Every one who really believes that Christ is God's anointed Man must desire to be in the good of his or her baptism, to be manifestly on the side of that Man whom God distinguishes. Those are the people who compose the assembly of God and form the temple of God.
I thought it would be well to read these verses today to see the greatness of the position the assembly occupies. Unless we do, I do not think we shall be able to enter much into the thought of the assembly.
Rem. Last time you referred to the need of the Spirit to support faith.
C.A.C. Well, I think it is important for us to recognise that faith is not sufficient, there must be a divine power to
{21}
maintain things, and that lies in the Spirit. Many believers begin with faith, but decline because they do not keep company with the Spirit. So in chapter 3 the apostle stresses that fact. In chapter 2 he stresses that his own service has been by the Spirit; here he tells the saints that they are the temple of God and the Spirit dwells in them. The Spirit is needed to support and maintain in our souls the things we have received from God.
Rem. These are such great things and we are so feeble that we need divine power to be maintained in them.
C.A.C. Yes. The thought of being the temple of God would suggest that it is a place where the service of God can go on suitably. That is the thought of the temple. There would be light in the temple. There were idolatrous temples in which dark and dreadful mysteries were enshrined. We should be exercised that there should be something in the place where we live which has the character of the temple of God. There is much around that has not.
Ques. When the apostle touches one of these vital points, he says, "Do ye not know?" Why does he say that?
C.A.C. I think it intimates that there may be great realities that we have never recognised. There are Christians around us who have no thought of the temple. Have we recognised the temple of God as a place where there is divine light, and where God can be served and which is marked by holiness? It is a very important matter if we are going to serve God in His temple that we should take our shoes off as Moses did before serving. And Joshua too, before he commenced his service was told to take off his shoes in recognition of the holiness of the place where God was.
Rem. That would not hinder liberty.
C.A.C. No, it would *create* liberty! There is no liberty apart from holiness. We do not want liberty apart from holiness!
Rem. It says, "The temple of God is holy, and such
{22}
are *ye*".
C.A.C. If there is a wrong state it can only be put right by the truth. If the testimony of Jesus being God's Anointed is accepted, and the truth of the cross as setting aside every other man, then we come to it that we are the temple of God where He dwells. We have to accept that as a great divine reality.
Ques. Will you please say what you mean by taking off our shoes?
C.A.C. I suppose it intimates to us that we set ourselves aside and any dignity or greatness that might have attached to us and we take the lowest place. The ground is holy. God said to Moses, "The place whereon thou standest is holy ground" (@Exodus 3: 5). That is, there is no suitability in anything being found here that is not of God.
Rem. It says in Ecclesiastes, "Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and draw near to hear, rather than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they know not that they do evil. Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter anything before God: for God is in the heavens, and thou upon earth; therefore let thy words be few" (chapter 5: 1, 2).
C.A.C. Yes, I think that is very helpful in this connection. There is a danger of saying too much; we had better say a little that the Spirit of God can sanction rather than a great deal otherwise. In the assembly you would not look for an excessive amount of utterance but for things to be said which the Spirit could sanction. I think that taking off the shoes would intimate putting off what is not suitable for God. The shoes are loosened as not suitable to holy ground.
Ques. In what way is the temple looked at here?
C.A.C. I think that it is the place where God is suitably served, but the prominent thought here is holiness, the definite exclusion of what is not holy. We have to
{23}
recognise that we are connected with what is intrinsically and essentially holy -- that is the character of the things to which we belong.
Ques. Would taking off the shoes mean there is no standing for man, but the place is a place of service?
C.A.C. That is very important, so that we serve God in relation to what has come entirely from God. "All is of thee, and of that which is from thy hand have we given thee", David said (@1 Chronicles 29: 14). It is what comes from God into the hearts of His saints and gladdens them, and they can bring it back to Him, and it bears the stamp of holiness.
Then the thought of the temple suggests *intelligence* -- that God is intelligently served. In heathendom every idol temple would be marked by certain persons who understood, or pretended to understand, how that particular god should be served. There was nothing casual or haphazard about the service in the temple at Jerusalem. The courses of the Levites or the priests were all ordered. There were songs, they sang psalms that were inspired, that were indited by the Spirit of God and therefore acceptable to God.
Rem. Ezekiel was to show the form of the temple to the house of Israel to make them ashamed. "Make known to them the form of the house, and its fashion, and its going out, and its comings in, and all its forms, and all its statutes, yea, all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof; and write it in their sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the statutes thereof, and do them. This is the law of the house: Upon the top of the mountain all its border round about is most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house" (@Ezekiel 43: 11, 12).
C.A.C. That is very helpful. We have to bear in mind that we are in the midst of the christian profession, and we have to learn the true character of the temple and service. There are things which God has ordered and appointed, the
{24}
service in the temple is all in accord with what God has appointed.
The temple of God is a place of light, light is continually shining there. The candlesticks in the temple were bearing light, so light is maintained in the ministry by the Spirit; so that we are instructed priests who know what to do and how to do it. It is a great matter to accept these things as the truth of God. They may humble us, but at the same time they lift us up to the holy thoughts of God.
This subject is further developed in chapter 5 where the saints are spoken of as being unleavened: "according as ye are unleavened". That is what the assembly is in its true character. It is the holy temple of God, and it is an unleavened lump, therefore if anything comes in that belongs to the former state of things it is to be purged out -- it is a little bit of the old lump of what we were according to the flesh brought over. Satan would like to bring it over to what is really unleavened.
Then there is a holy watchfulness to be maintained, for the old leaven is not far from any of us -- it is myself -- and the danger is that it may leaven the whole lump; so we must deal with it promptly and cast it out. This does not refer to the evil committed but to the puffing up of the company who had not mourned over it. That was old leaven and that had to be purged out. To meet that, the apostle brought in a new apprehension of Christ that they had not had before. God generally does that when we have been wrong: He brings in a new impression of Christ. There is a difference between Christ *crucified* and Christ *sacrificed*. The Corinthians got away from the former, and God recovered them by presenting Christ sacrificed -- a deeper lesson. If I am going on rightly, God helps me by continual presentations of Christ; if I am going on wrongly, He helps me by a presentation of Christ. That is God! It is wonderful!
Crucifixion is a public matter. Every one can take account of a crucified man as put in the place of curse and
{25}
dishonour. But Christ sacrificed is a more inward thing and refers to all He went through in His holy soul as typically roast with fire. As we move on in the epistles we are more able to take account of Christ's death as an intimate matter. The attention of the household was concentrated on the lamb for four days before it was sacrificed, intimating that God would have us consider Christ in His spotless character and perfect suitability, and then sacrificed and eaten in this character. This is a private matter. I believe it is an intense, personal exercise before God. It is *to be eaten*. It is not Christ crucified, that was a spectacle, something to be looked at. "Jesus Christ has been portrayed, crucified among you", Paul wrote to the Galatians (chapter 3: 1). It is a far deeper thing to eat the lamb roast with fire, and it is intended to give the power to get rid of the leaven. If it is an assembly that is affected by leaven, it is only done by this intimate personal eating of the passover. He has been exposed to the public judgment of God and now He has been sacrificed. If we want to get to @1 Corinthians 11 we shall have to reach it by way of chapter 5.
It is possible to see Christ crucified and yet to become bewitched as the Galatians were. But feeding on Him would prevent that; it would give us a constitution that would preserve us from being bewitched. The passover was eaten at home; it is the intimate consideration of Christ as coming under the action of the judgment of God. He is *our Passover*. Thus we become attached to Him. The four days give the opportunity for the firstborn sons to become attached to Him. So God secures "firstborn ones". The passover is very important and wide in its range.
The Lord would help us so that we should eat the passover in company with Him, and consequent on that is the keeping of the feast. All leaven was to be discarded for seven days, typifying the whole christian period. There is power brought in to refuse the leaven. This is how the assembly assumes its true character. Someone might say,
{26}
We cannot set ourselves up as being unleavened. Well, let us acknowledge the fact that God says, "Ye are unleavened". He would say, 'I am going to bring Christ into your affections in such a way that you will get rid of it without any trouble'. This is brought about by private and personal consideration of Christ as the passover. I think we have much too small a thought of the passover, as if it were only very initial and elementary, but it is the greatest of all sacrifices, and of which God says, "My sacrifice" (@Exodus 23: 18). It is the only sacrifice by which He gets His own firstborn sons out of the world for His pleasure. I think it is correct to say we have to eat our way out.
{27}
NOTES OF A READING @1 CORINTHIANS 5: 1 - 13
C.A.C. We cannot but notice that the first administrative action in the assembly, referred to in this chapter, is connected with the judgment of evil. It would seem to suggest that that is of primary importance. If the unleavened character of the assembly is not preserved there is no moral foundation for anything. Holiness is the law of God's house, as it is written, "Holiness becometh thy house, O Jehovah, for ever" (@Psalm 93: 5). The assembly of God is marked by great sensitiveness as to what is evil; this was lacking at Corinth, so that there was found amongst them that which was very much condemned, even in the world. Yet they were not mourning about it, but puffed up. They were very well pleased with themselves when they had evil among them that was abhorrent even to the natural man. It shows how they had fallen under carnal influences; it was manifest in how they were divided into parties, and later we find them going to law for redress. It all showed extreme lack of spiritual sensibility. They ought to have been preserved instinctively from such things, without instruction. Priestly sensibilities were lacking. We ought to feel that things are right. Scripture speaks of fulfilling the law according to nature, showing "the work of the law" in man's heart (@Romans 2: 14, 15). They ought to have mourned, even if they did not know how to deal with such a case; then God would have taken this wicked person away. A Christian walking in the flesh may become harder than a man of the world -- duller in sensibilities. Even the grace of God can be turned into lasciviousness. There is such a thing as people having a superficial knowledge of grace, making them more careless than when under law. Grace should have a much greater effect. The Corinthians had come under bad influence. It is one of the first instincts of the
{28}
divine nature to shrink from evil.
And the apostle sets up the standard as to how such things are to be dealt with. Evil is not to be allowed in the assembly. The apostle had judged it himself, and he required that they should judge it, that they should act regarding this person. It is a very solemn warning to us that, after having light from God, and the Spirit, when there was glaring evil among them they were not disturbed.
Rem. The assembly is the place of divine light and where judgment is carried out.
C.A.C. We find here that a man that acts wickedly is delivered to Satan. The apostle exercised his authority in delivering him to Satan, which meant, I suppose, some bodily affliction. They had just come out of the heathen world, which was full of dreadful conditions, and had brought a good deal of the old leaven with them. So Paul takes one man as an example -- for there were many. As he said in his second epistle, he was afraid he would find many who had not repented. God had the intention of getting to the root of their state. The Corinthians were to judge their condition and cast out the man. He was not the leaven, but it was their whole condition; it was more important that the assembly should get clear. One unhappy feature of the state of christendom is that there is practically no judgment of evil. Only the apostle could commit a man to Satan. It is very wonderful that he takes account of the man as capable of having his spirit saved in the day of the Lord Jesus -- that he was a believer. The object in view is the ultimate blessing of a very grave sinner who is to be discredited publicly. We are not exactly called upon to decide whether a person is converted or not, we could hardly do that.
Rem. Could this be done today -- to put a man away?
C.A.C. We have had some exercise as to whether it is quite suitable under prevailing conditions to do things formally on this ground, but in withdrawal the end arrived at is the same. We are all called upon to carry out @2 Timothy 2,
{29}
and the result is that the one withdrawn from is not walking with us nor we with him. @1 Corinthians 5 is a matter of obligation and we have the light of it always before us without assuming exactly to be the assembly. We do not want to weaken one scripture to strengthen another, and in every case of discipline we act on this chapter. Many have felt that in a day of ruin and scattering it is more comely to take the ground of withdrawing from a person. It is proper to the assembly of God that one who has been walking wickedly should be dealt with by God and we look on that as a fixed principle. Paul looks upon them as gathered together (verse 4); that is, there was a solemn act of the assembly and the apostle identified his name with it and the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. In any act of discipline we ought to be assured that Paul is with us, and the Lord Jesus Christ in it, otherwise it would hardly be right. And it has absolute authority over us all -- it ought to have -- and we bow to the commandments of the Lord.
Then he brings in the thought of leaven. If leaven is not judged it will spread, it is the very nature of it. What has the character of unjudged evil will spread, and must be purged out. What the assembly is abstractly remains true -- a holy and unleavened company -- and nothing contrary to it can be tolerated. There is to be nothing brought over of the old lump (that is, something brought over from our unconverted days). So now it is necessary to keep the feast. We are to realise that Christ was actually sacrificed; that is, there was not the slightest toleration of evil when Christ took the judgment of it upon Himself in love. He had to bear in His holy perfection all the judgment due to us, and if He did, how can we possibly think of going on with it?
"A new lump" (verse 7) -- the assembly was to take on that character practically. It is one of the descriptions of the assembly. We once belonged to an old lump that was thoroughly leavened, but we have been taken out of that, to be a new lump without any leaven at all. There is no reason
{30}
why leaven should work in any saint. The feast of unleavened bread was for seven days; we are always keeping the feast. The passover was the basis of everything. The lamb was "roast with fire" (@Exodus 12: 9); that is, every bit of the working of flesh in me -- well, Christ bore the judgment of it. I could not very well go on with it if I thought of that, could I?
The "unleavened bread of sincerity and truth" is the contrast to the leaven. I think it is the saints viewed in their responsibility, they are to be an unleavened lump. There is no reason that the flesh should ever work in me.
The assembly is a place where discipline is exercised, and where there is no discipline there is no assembly!
Then he shows that we are not to have social intercourse with wicked persons, "with such a one not even to eat". There is not to be any intercourse with a person who has been removed from intercourse with the brethren, except what is priestly. The priest had to look at a leper from time to time to see if he were healed. We have a responsibility towards, and a care towards, any in the town we have withdrawn from -- it is not done to get rid of them, but to secure them; it is their blessing all the time that is in view, and we should always keep that side in view. If we carry on as if nothing had happened, we are really doing that person an injury. The apostle, no doubt, yearned over this man, and this man was liable to be swallowed up by excessive grief (how we should love to see that!). And Paul goes over to the side of comforting him. But he says, "It was not for the sake of him that injured, nor for the sake of him that was injured, but for the sake of our diligent zeal for you being manifested to you before God" (@2 Corinthians 7: 12). He was concerned about the assembly, and the Lord always supports His people in that when He sees it.
This chapter is of importance for us, for we are unlikely to go through a course of years without having to do with cases that call for the holy discipline of the assembly.
{31}
RIGHTEOUSNESS IN THE LAST DAYS
@1 Corinthians 5: 1 - 13; @2 Timothy 2: 1 - 26
In the first of these scriptures it seems to me that four distinct actions are contemplated. Of course, they all operated together at Corinth, but they are distinguishable one from the other.
Firstly, the apostolic action in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, with which the saints (as gathered together and having the power of our Lord Jesus Christ) are identified, by which the wicked person was delivered to Satan for destruction of the flesh. I think it would be generally agreed that there is no apostolic power to act thus today.
Secondly, that with such a one there was to be no mixing -- "not even to eat". The application of this would clearly be individual, and it is as obligatory on each individual saint as ever.
Thirdly, "Remove the wicked person from amongst yourselves". This was to be the act of the whole company of saints. The evil-doer was to be no longer of their company. He was to be excommunicated from the privileges and fellowship of the assembly, and outside there was nothing for him but the world of darkness and Satan's power. It was a "rebuke" terrible in its nature, and, as we know, well-nigh overwhelming in its effect.
Fourthly, "Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, according as ye are unleavened". This was a deeper and more searching exercise than merely getting rid of the wicked person. The fact that such a one was amongst them, and known to be so, without any mourning being caused, exposed their general state, and it was this which, I think we might say, was the most serious aspect of the case. There was general puffing up, boasting and the allowance of what was fleshly in many ways. All this "leaven" was to
{32}
be purged out, that the assembly might be practically true to its character as a "new lump" and "unleavened".
All this is before us in its solemnity and force as the commandment of the Lord. In proportion as we limit it in thought to anything less than the whole assembly of God, we lose in our souls its import, its unspeakable gravity, and it is well that a deep sense of this should be retained. The desire to preserve the force of this makes me hesitate to use "yourselves" in a limited sense. That is, to appropriate the "yourselves" of @1 Corinthians 5: 13 to a few saints who are perhaps today the one-hundredth part of the assembly of God in a town. The assembly as such could, and did, act then effectively as an administrative body with divine authority. The "yourselves" was the whole christian company -- a concrete company from which a wicked person could be excluded. The fact that the assembly is not in view as such a company today is the sad evidence of ruin through man's failure. Indeed, it was the appalling contrast between what he saw the church to be in Scripture, and what it had become in his day, that led Augustine to speak of the "invisible church" and the expression has been in common use ever since. The use of such an expression is in itself the most complete evidence of utter ruin.
We have to feel, and it is right we should feel, the changed conditions. We may be sure that the heart of Christ is very deeply affected by the ruin, and He will not suffer His saints to be unaffected by it. It is really a very holy privilege to be sympathetic with the heart of Christ as to the ruin of that which bears His name in this world. If we are so, it will surely lead us to act with simplicity and lowliness becoming the present state of things. We have, I trust in some measure, the sorrow of being conscious that in the present conditions no such corporate action of the assembly as could be taken at Corinth is possible. It brings home to us that we are in the last days and not in the first.
But are we, on that account, to give up the truth, and
{33}
accept association with evil? Far be the thought! If any principle or pretext were alleged which would have the effect of causing saints to continue in association with evil it would be obviously making the commandment of God of none effect. We must certainly in the light of @1 Corinthians 5 refuse all fellowship and intercourse with a wicked person. But we must also recognise that all the conditions in the christian profession are changed.
It is these changed conditions which have been distinctly taken account of, and provided for, in 2 Timothy. In that epistle we have the Lord's mind as to how faithful saints should act in the last days, and how those saints should walk *together*. But it is essential to the right understanding of 2 Timothy that we should see that the light of the ministry of the gospel and of the ministry of the assembly is supposed to be possessed by the persons who are in view. That is, the epistle is addressed to an individual who has heard things of Paul, and who is thoroughly acquainted with Paul's doctrine (@2 Timothy 2: 2; @2 Timothy 3: 10). These things, entrusted to faithful men, are to be the subject of instruction amongst the saints. This would clearly include what we have in Romans and Corinthians, and also Colossians and Ephesians. Every scripture is also spoken of as "divinely inspired, and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may be complete, fully fitted to every good work" (@2 Timothy 3: 16, 17). This proves that no part of Paul's doctrine, or indeed of any scripture, is to drop out of account.
In the light of all this the faithful saint is to "shun" vain babblings (chapter 2: 16), everyone who names the name of the Lord is to "withdraw from iniquity" (verse 19), and he who would be "a vessel to honour, sanctified, serviceable to the Master, prepared for every good work" must purify himself from vessels to dishonour "in separating himself from them" (verse 21). He must "flee" youthful lusts (verse 22), and "avoid" foolish and senseless questionings (verse 23). These
{34}
things, negative though they be, are most necessary in the midst of a profession where iniquity abounds.
But there is something positive also. We are to "pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart" (verse 22). The pursuit of these things would clearly involve practical consistency with every part of the truth which the individual has heard and known as Paul's teaching. As *in the light of the truth of the assembly* he finds here definite instructions in relation to his walking together with other like-minded saints. The "with" clearly brings in what is collective. He is not to be isolated. How could he be in the light of the assembly? Righteousness, faith, love, peace, are bound up with the practical recognition of our divine bond with all saints as members of one another in Christ's body, and as built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit. We cannot pursue these four things *alone*; in the very nature of the case it must be "*with* those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart". This necessitates much individual exercise, for if I am not pursuing righteousness, faith, love, peace, how shall I be able to discern others who are doing so in dependence upon, and desiring loyalty to, the Lord? "A pure heart" suggests that there must be more than the *claim* to be such; it must be a reality before the Lord, and when it is so there will hardly be the need or desire to *claim* it. The heart is set on maintaining it *under His eye* in spiritual reality.
The assembly exists, and all truth pertaining to it -- including l Corinthians -- remains as divine light for us, but our path amidst the ruin is marked out in 2 Timothy. No company can claim to have the status of the assembly, or to act as such. But saints can still, in the light of @1 Corinthians 5, refuse intercourse with a wicked person. It is imperative that they should do so. Indeed it is clear that none of such as were characterised by the moral traits of @2 Timothy 2: 22 would go on with a wicked person. To recognise the authority of @1 Corinthians 5: 13 as the commandment of the
{35}
Lord, and to be consistent with it, is part of the "righteousness" we are to pursue according to 2 Timothy, and we do so in company with our brethren who are treading the same path. Saints *act together* as pursuing "righteousness". And they not only have in mind the necessity for withdrawing from iniquity, but they act as those who have apprehended the true character of the assembly, God's house, as being essentially holy, and thus necessarily *exclusive of evil*. Profound exercise as to this before God, and eating the sin-offering, is of the deepest importance. But all this is spiritual and priestly exercise *within* -- a *temple* character of things which forms the moral basis in souls of the action taken in public. This must have due place, or we shall lose a solemn element which should be present in every dealing with a wicked person.
The assembly is characterised by purity, it is the abode of God's holiness. If the saints are the shrine where God dwells, this necessitates the positive refusal and rejection of evil. But we do not limit the thought of the purity and holiness of God's house to any special company of saints. All saints are of that house, and we apprehend things from that point of view. At Corinth there was a concrete company which had that character, and from which a wicked person could be excluded. But we are in a time of ruin, and though the assembly still exists, and is still characterised by holiness, it is not in view as a concrete company. But exercised saints can apprehend the character of God's house, and walk together consistently with it, in spite of the ruin, though, of course, very much affected by it. If we walk together in the light of what pertains to the whole company, we necessarily take action and we do so together. We come to the solemn judgment as before God that an evil-doer is unfit for christian fellowship, and we sever all our links of association and fellowship with him. Nothing could be more simple and definite, or more absolutely in keeping with @1 Corinthians 5.
{36}
Saints do not claim to act as the assembly, or as being the "yourselves" contemplated in @1 Corinthians 5: 13, because they take account of the true scope of "yourselves", and they realise the present ruin under the eye of the Lord. But they seek to maintain consistency with every part of assembly truth, and every divine principle. They seek to come together and act together, in such a way that the Lord may be able to own them as gathered to His name and acting in His name. They desire, above all, that His presence with them may be their support, and that every act may be so carried out as to have moral value under God's eye. But they own the ruin, and do not set up to be anything. They are conscious that their place of blessing and power is to be a poor and afflicted people whose trust is in the name of the Lord. He will not fail such. They act together in refusing to be linked with evil, but the only community or corporate body which they recognise is the whole assembly.
The peculiar conditions of a day of ruin tend to narrow us in thought. If we have found a few saints with whom we can walk according to the truth, and on the line of @2 Timothy 2: 22, we have to be exercised that we do not connect with them in a corporate way ideas which properly are only to be attached to the whole company of saints. Beloved and honoured servants of the Lord have frequently warned us against any such limitation. And I trust we recognise the importance of keeping such warning in mind. There are many expressions which we commonly use, as a matter of convenience, in a limited sense as referring to those who walk together. Such expressions as "we", "us", "ourselves", "the saints", "the brethren", "the assembly", "fellowship". So long as these are used simply and understood there is no harm in them, and I have no doubt we shall continue to use them. But the very fact that we do so renders it wholesome for us to be reminded occasionally that if they were used *formally* in this restricted sense they
{37}
would be purely sectarian. We need to keep our hearts and minds in the largeness of the assembly of God, while our feet are kept in the path of 2 Timothy.
The present application of @1 Corinthians 5 will be found as saints regulate their associations in the light of it, and its moral force will be preserved in their souls and in their actions. It has present authority and application, but it should be clearly before us that we act in the light of it as walking together according to @2 Timothy 2: 22. Each walks in the light of the assembly, and seeks to pursue consistency with every part of assembly truth, and this is the divine way in which saints can walk together in the last days.
This is important as involving personal exercise on the part of each one. And this individual character of things is very suited to the last days, and gives faithful testimony a peculiar character and value. It is very possible that, while what was done at Corinth was the act of the assembly *as such*, there might have been many individuals among them who were not truly in accord with it (see @2 Corinthians 12: 20, 21 ). But now each faithful individual is to pursue righteousness, etc., and what is collective really results from what is individual. Thus in the day of ruin it may be possible for things to be maintained under the eye of God in even greater moral value than was the case at Corinth. Faith and faithfulness came out with peculiar lustre in the dark days of Israel's history, and it may be so in the corresponding time of the church's history. We surely desire to have our little part in such divine favour!
You ask, if two or three in a day of ruin come together, say on Lord's day morning, do they not do it in assembly *character*, if as you have rightly insisted they are "of the assembly" in the place?
I should say that the two or three are "of the assembly" and are therefore responsible to judge themselves, and to see to it that their associations, ways and spirit are in
{38}
keeping with its holy character. It is also one of the first elements in "righteousness" that they should recognise and own the ruin into which things have fallen in the assembly of which they form part. In proportion as they are here for Christ, and devoted to His interests, they can be found gathered together unto His name and acting in His name, and they will have *assembly character*. But if their actions are such as to manifest indifference to Christ, or failure to maintain His rights, or are out of accord with the truth, though they are "of the assembly" they are not found in *assembly character*. There are many 'believers meetings' which could not be recognised as having assembly character at all, though all believers in them are "of the assembly". It is as saints are formed in these moral features which properly belong to the assembly that it may be said that they come together in *assembly character*. But the more truly they come together in assembly character the less disposed will they be to claim to do so in any formal or ecclesiastical way. The character of their assembling, and of their actions, will speak for itself, and be justified by the truth. To speak, in a day of ruin, of coming together in *assembly character* in any other sense than as having the moral features of the assembly would be, I fear, that very ecclesiasticism which F.E.R. and others have so dreaded and deprecated, and with which J.N.D. would not have had an atom of sympathy.
In connection with this, I would like to call your attention to a most important paper, which, I am sure, you have often read and pondered. I refer to J.N.D.s Considerations on the Nature and Unity of the Church of Christ, written in 1828 (Collected Writings 1). That paper contained, as you know, the seed of the great spiritual movement which, in the Lord's ways, marked the last century so distinctively. What is so prominent and striking in it is the intense depth of exercise which it discloses as to *the moral features of the assembly*. This was the line on
{39}
which assembly truth was recovered. It showed unmistakably that everything ecclesiastical was in complete ruin, but emphasised that that ruin was brought about by unfaithfulness and spiritual decline and defection. It presents everything from the moral side. It was in this way that the Spirit of God recalled saints in these last days to the truth of the assembly. It was no question of recovery to correct scriptural order, or to assembly position, but of exercise as to the restoration of those blessed moral features which mark the assembly. And I think we must conclude that divine revival could only be brought about in this way; the point of departure must be the point of recovery. It might well be a deep exercise for us, do you not think, as to how far we do come together in assembly character?
Then you ask, 'Is it no longer possible for any saints to "come together *in assembly*" because they cannot find the whole?' I do not question the possibility of this. I am sure that as saints walk according to @2 Timothy 2: 22, and come together responsive to the Lord's love, they will know what it is to be in assembly, and to taste largely, through His marvellous grace, of assembly privilege. May we desire and experience this more and more! But is it not quite another matter for a few saints amidst the ruin of the last days to claim that they can exercise assembly administration in discipline formally as at the beginning? The assembly which was together in Corinth in outward unity as God's assembly in that city is now broken and scattered, a great part of it submerged in the world. Indeed, such is the state of things that the fact that two or three come together as seeking to walk in the truth is but a witness, as J.N.D. said, to the ruin. The fact that we are in entirely changed conditions is forced in a sorrowful way upon our attention.
My exercise is that we should adequately recognise the present ruin: it is one of the first elements of "righteousness" to do so; and it will be the first effect of receiving the light of the assembly. J.N.D. said, 'If any
{40}
Christians now set up to be the church, or did any formal act which pretended to it, I should leave them as being a false pretension, and denying *the very testimony to the state of ruin which God has called us to render* ... . I think it of the last importance that this pretension of any body should be kept down: I could not own it a moment, because it is not the truth' (Collected Writings 1: 350). I quote this for the words I have put in italics, which indicate J.N.D.s sense of the importance of not losing sight of the ruin. The conditions are not now as at Corinth. J.N.D.s paper On The Formation of Churches, written in 1840, contains much that is instructive in principle as to this, though he is not speaking of the point that is at present before us. For example, 'A return from existing evil unto that which God at the first set up, is therefore not always a proof that we have understood His word and will. Nevertheless, we shall rightly and truly judge that what He did at the first set up was good, and that we have departed from it' (Collected Writings 1: 142). 'Shall we, who are guilty of this state of things, pretend we have only to set about and remedy it? No; the attempt would but prove that we are not humbled thereby. Let us rather search in all humility what God says to us in His word of such a condition of things; and let us not, like foolish children who have broken a precious vase, attempt to join together its broken fragments, and to set it up in hopes to hide the damage from the notice of others' (Collected Writings 1: 144). 'I am enquiring what the word and the Spirit say of the state of the fallen church, instead of arrogating to myself a competency to realise that which the Spirit has spoken of the first condition of the church ... . The lowliness that feels aright the real condition of the church, preserves us from pretensions' (Collected Writings l: 146).
It is not enough to see that an expression is in Scripture. We must take account of the conditions in which the Spirit used it, and we have to ask whether the same conditions are present now. The propriety, or otherwise, of using words
{41}
now in a *formal way* which stand connected *in Scripture* with the assembly in its original character and unity is a matter for spiritual discernment.
What was perfectly suitable and appropriate when the building was intact might be pretentious if taken up formally when it is in ruins. The Lord has revived, in infinite grace, Paul's ministry, and also (especially since J.N.D.s departure) John's. In the light of this there has been both separating and gathering of saints. But I think we should conclude from Scripture that the work of the Spirit at the end would not be on the line of re-establishing the Corinthian order so much as bringing about personal attachment to Christ and love to the brethren, so that all that is vitally characteristic of the assembly should be found here.
In Philadelphia everything is cherished which is divinely precious and vital. It is that which was from the beginning revived and restored in mercy at the end. Not a restoration of assembly status, but a revival of Christ in the affections of His saints, leading to love of the brethren. This is the principle on which saints may walk together even in the most difficult times; it is in line with 2 Timothy, and we may surely count upon the Lord to maintain it to the end.
The Lord has given through many "vessels to honour" a very blessed ministry of truth concerning Christ and the assembly. That ministry has made its way in the face of conflict all the time, and its effect, where spiritually received, has been that man in the flesh has been known as set aside in the cross, Christ's word and name have become precious and cherished, and the brethren have been loved. This is Philadelphia as I understand it. Not an ecclesiastical body, but saints characterised, amidst the ruin of the ecclesiastical body and owning their share in it, by spiritual affections and intelligence such as were found in the assembly at the beginning.
I most fully own, and rejoice in, the abiding value of
{42}
@Matthew 18: 20. It is blessed encouragement for even "two or three" of the assembly, and though not given especially for a day of ruin it becomes available in such a day. To be gathered together unto Christ's name secures His presence; it is privilege and power. And "two or three" may still act in His name, and with the sanction of His presence. Who could doubt that such acts are "bound in heaven"?
But then all this produces deep exercise. J.N.D. is careful to say, 'Their acts, *if really done in His name*, have His authority'. This is just the point. It is not for any two or three to *claim* that they do things in His name, but to be exercised in every way -- in the consideration of Scripture, and in much prayer and humble dependence -- that it should really be so. And this is especially important in a day when there is not only the general ruin, but the added confusion of many companies claiming to meet and act in His name. I add that, of course, the responsibility that it should be really so in any dealing with evil rests upon saints locally; saints elsewhere own what is done, as J.N.D. says.
If two or three really act in Christ's name amidst the ruin, would you not expect that their action would be both morally suitable to the matter in hand, and to the conditions in which the action is taken? Christ takes account of the ruin; He is deeply affected by it. Would it not be in accord with Him for us to own that the conditions are changed from what they were at Corinth? The subject of our present inquiry is not whether two or three may act in His name or not, but as to what manner of acting -- or rather, what ground to be taken in acting -- is most suitable to His name in a day of ruin?
To *have* assembly character, and to *act* in Christ's name, is blessed divine favour. To *claim* that we have this character, and that we so act, might be the most worthless pretension. May our exercise ever be to have things in spiritual reality! And it may be well to remember that we do not necessarily get rid of pretension by seeing that 2
{43}
Timothy is our special charter in the last days. A few individuals who *claimed* that they acted and walked together according to @2 Timothy 2: 22 might be the most pretentious persons on earth. The true value of what we do does not consist in what we claim it to be, but in what it is under God's eye.
<hr>
I fully appreciate the importance of order. If saints walk together according to @2 Timothy 2: 22 in the light of all assembly truth, and seek, through grace, to maintain practical consistency with it in a day of ruin, I feel sure that of such it may be said, "Rejoicing and seeing your order" (@Colossians 2: 5). But this would be found without any thought of setting up to be an administrative body.
The truth regarding overseers or elders supplies a suggestive and helpful analogy. Elders and deacons had an important place in church administration at the beginning. No intelligent brother would think of taking any such place officially now. But I trust it is a matter of continual exercise with us that the care and service should be maintained. And in some feeble measure it is maintained.
All that is comely and in accord with divine order will be found with those who walk together according to @2 Timothy 2: 22. But they will have no more thought of setting up to be an administrative body than those who serve in care and ministry would have of setting up to be deacons or elders. Divine order is maintained -- as to the moral reality of it -- without anything formal and therefore without pretension. It is consistent with the order of the assembly that a wicked person should be excluded from the companionship of those walking together. But this will be done on the line of following righteousness, and through each one taking up the exercise of it personally, and maintaining separation from the one in question. And, of course,
{44}
in such a case those walking together would act together. All that pertains to order and administration is secured, so far as possible in a day of ruin, as saints move on together in accord with the testimony. But there is no claim or attempt to secure this in a formal way in the scene of the church's ruin, though there is that which *faith* can recognise as in keeping with due order.
'Church position' is perhaps a somewhat ambiguous phrase. If it means that all saints are by God's grace and calling, and as having the Spirit, of Christ's body and God's house, and that all saints are responsible to be consistent with this position, and that those who walk together in the truth recognise this, and seek to be consistent with it personally and in their associations, I do not object to it. But if it means that a certain company of persons have 'church position' *in the scene of ruin* in a way special and distinct from other saints, it is ground which I do not care to take.
Spiritually, and as a matter of faith, it is open to those in separation from evil to enjoy assembly position and privilege to the full measure of their spiritual capability -- that is, the measure of faith, affection, growth, intelligence, and the Spirit's power; the measure, too, of the Lord's grace, in vouchsafing His presence to them and the gain of His headship. But when it comes to a question of the position which we take up formally *here* in the scene of the church's ruin, and conscious, as we surely are, that we are involved in that ruin, I think the greatest lowliness and the absence of all pretension whether in thought or word are becoming. To have the two sides clearly before us, and not to confound the one with the other, is very necessary if we are to be found here in intelligent accord with the testimony. As we know and enter into the grace and blessedness of the former, we can afford to take very low and simple ground in the latter. I believe the present exercise is intended to help us as to both, for if we are
{45}
defective on one side we shall almost inevitably be defective on both.
Providing that holiness in separation from evil were fully and practically maintained, I should be happy to leave my brethren free as to the terms which, in godly exercise, they might judge suitable to use, because it is the act of complete severance from what is evil which to me is vital, and not the words in which it is expressed. If they felt happy to use literally the words of @1 Corinthians 5: 13 it would not affect my love for them or my fellowship with them, because I trust that *in mind and spirit* my brethren feel, and desire to own, the ruin as much as I do. If it were a matter of conscience with them to use those words I would defer to them. But personally I would desire to avoid the use of terms which might appear to involve the assumption that 'church position' attached in some special way to a certain company. That a few saints are privileged to walk together in these last days, through the Lord's peculiar grace, in the light of assembly truth and assembly position is true, and I count it great divine favour to walk with them.
Can it be truly said that the form of action which is regarded as comely in this little paper involves disobedience to the commandment of the Lord, and that it should be separated from as iniquity? Brethren must judge as to whether this is so. If a person is absolutely excluded from the companionship and fellowship of those who walk together, is he not, as a simple matter of fact, removed from amongst them? Is not the Scripture obeyed so far as possible in present conditions? Could any words that could be used add to the completeness or definiteness of the severance? And it must be admitted that even @1 Corinthians 5: 13 is not a *formula*; it was an injunction to be carried out in *fact*. Where then is disobedience? In what does it consist? There is the fullest possible obedience, but it has taken a form becoming to the day of the church's ruin.
There is a serious exercise as to whether it is comely to
{46}
formally take the place in the scene of the church's ruin, of a 'company' having 'church position'. It is not thought well to have the 'company' idea in mind save as embracing, in principle, the whole. There are dangers to be guarded against -- a sectarian position or thought on the one hand, and a lack of due recognition of the ruin on the other. Those who do not agree with the way in which this exercise is sought to be expressed may surely in brotherly love respect the exercise and bear with it. It in no way infringes on what is due to the Lord. No one can say that what are called 'new' principles have been productive, or are at all likely to be productive, of laxity in associations. It must be obvious that to insist on each individual being true to certain principles in no way relaxes the obligations which are common to all. But the principles advocated are, in truth, as old as 2 Timothy.
In conclusion, I would submit to the judgment of others the following considerations. Firstly, is not the act of exclusion or separation from a wicked person an act which stands in connection with our position and attitude in that which is now the scene of the church's ruin? Secondly, can we take up formally any position or attitude *in that scene* save that of being involved in the ruin? Thirdly, are not the words which we use in such circumstances a solemn and formal announcement to which all who walk together are definitely committed? Fourthly, if these three questions are answered in the only way in which it seems to me they can be answered, is it not right and seemly that the words used should be in keeping with the truth of the position? It is really a question of where we are, or where we consider ourselves to be, in the place where the church is in ruin.
The exercise as to this matter may appear to some to be a mere quibble about words. But I am convinced that when saints consider it soberly apart from the atmosphere and spirit of controversy, and especially apart from any thought that it involves separation from our brethren, they will
{47}
realise that it is perhaps more important than at first appeared. The exercise has been widespread, and one feels constrained to believe that, under the Lord's hand, there is needed divine instruction in it. May it be our concern to see what that instruction is and profit by it! And may we be subject to one another in the fear of Christ, and be ready to give due place to every part of the truth! May God enable us, in this last solemn and critical moment, when the enemy is seeking to disintegrate and scatter, to lay ourselves out diligently to endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace!
1920<br>Beloved Brother, ... It is many years since I saw the paper, Righteousness in the Last Days, but I believe the statements in it were intended to warn against the setting up on the part of the saints of any formal claim to be "the assembly". Well-known servants of the Lord, such as J.N.D. and F.E.R., had spoken in a similar way when circumstances seemed to call for it. But these honoured servants spent their lives in labouring that saints might be brought into the truth of the assembly, and might walk together according to it in spiritual reality. So that the warning against assuming in a formal way to be "the assembly" is quite consistent with the earnest desire that not one iota of the truth in regard to the assembly shall be a dead letter. I believe that the Lord intends us to walk in the light of every part of that truth. He has, in wondrous mercy, revived a testimony to what is in the mind of God, and I believe that He will maintain it.
I cannot understand saints who have had light as to the assembly, and who believe that the divine thought of fellowship, and of assembly features and privileges, has
{48}
been revived in mercy, and that these things are known in a practical way by thousands of saints the world over, taking the ground that assembly administration in dealing with evil is not to have any place. @Matthew 18: 15 - 20 is clearly part of the truth as to the assembly; it is a divine provision for matters which the Lord knew would arise. It may, of course, be said that the assembly is not in evidence in a concrete way as it was at Corinth. But if a few saints are in the light of the assembly, and in suitable moral conditions, assembly features will be there without any formal claim to be "the assembly". My impression is that, without any pretension, there is an increased cherishing of every part of the truth concerning the assembly, and increased desire to maintain it in a practical way. In order to this there must necessarily be the feature of assembly administration.
The Lord appears to have had a day of departure in mind when He added @Matthew 18: 19, 20 to what He had said before as to "the assembly". "Two of you" would be two of the assembly -- two who hold assembly ground spiritually, however great the general departure may be. If only "two" are available they can maintain what is due to the Lord in the assembly, in dependence upon His Father, and with the support and sanction of His presence. This, when the conditions of @Matthew 18: 19, 20 are found, is not a pretension but a spiritual reality, and it can be carried out in faithfulness to the Lord without any formal claim to be "the assembly".
I fully admit the weakness of things in the present day. It is manifested by the fact that I, or any other brother, may maintain the truth at one time and discredit it at another. You have had humiliating evidence of this in your own locality. But I cannot think of saints as able to take up in a practical way the fellowship, and the spiritual privilege of the assembly, and as having the Lord in their midst, and yet as unable to act with His sanction and authority in the matter of dealing with evil.
{49}
I am sorry to hear that some who have been withdrawn from claim that they are still in fellowship, for this seems to indicate an unwillingness to face the issues that have been raised, without which there cannot be a restoration of confidence.
I am not able to write as fully as I could wish, but I hope I have written enough to make clear what is in my mind. I fear that the statements in Righteousness in the Last Days may not have been sufficiently guarded, and it may be they would need to be balanced by the statement that assembly truth and principles can be maintained, by the grace of God, without any formal claim to be "the assembly". There has been a good deal of ministry which bears upon this with which I am in the fullest accord.
With much love in the Lord,<br>Yours affectionately in Him,<br>8 May 1941
{50}
CHRIST AS THE PASSOVER AND THE FEAST OF UNLEAVENED BREAD
@1 Corinthians 5: 7, 8
C.A.C. It has come before me whether it might not help us if we looked a little at Christ as the passover and the feast of unleavened bread. The Spirit of God has made them both one in @Luke 22: 1, "Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the passover, drew nigh".
I suppose that every thought of God must reach us first through our need. God begins with us in our deep need. He introduces His thoughts to us first in connection with our need. But there is what is much greater than our need or His meeting it, and that is what is in His heart, the thoughts He cherishes in His mind. It is a great thing if He brings into our souls a divine thought, as He can add to it and cause it to become bigger and bigger. We never leave anything behind in God's things. The passover is brought before us in different settings. It was kept (1) in Egypt, (2) in the wilderness, (3) in the land, (4) in the days of Hezekiah and Josiah, (5) in days of recovery (Ezra), and (6) in the most blessed way of all when the Lord Jesus was here on earth. It was constantly coming out in new circumstances. The climax, the full thought, is reached when it is "fulfilled in the kingdom of God". And, inasmuch as saints are in the kingdom of God now, it is the pleasure of God that we should come into the full thought now, and not only know it as at the first as a shelter from judgment. The kingdom of God is come for us; we are not waiting for it. As having the Holy Spirit, we are in the kingdom and the kingdom is in us. We may understand it in its fulness, as "fulfilled".
Rem. I think you have said that the kingdom of God was established when the Holy Spirit came down.
C.A.C. Yes. The kingdom of the heavens is established in a glorified Man in heaven. There is a Man
{51}
crowned with glory and honour in heaven this minute. There is supreme rule and influence from Him now. But the kingdom of God is established in the Holy Spirit down here. He is the seal of the righteousness of faith. "The kingdom of God is ... righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit" (@Romans 14: 17). It is what is in the Holy Spirit down here. The kingdom of God is a blessed sphere subsisting now, in the power of the Holy Spirit, down here in this world. We need to see what is here. Up there "we see Jesus ... crowned with glory and honour" (@Hebrews 2: 9), but there is also what is here. We need to have our eyes opened to see (as Elisha's servant of old, @2 Kings 6: 16, 17) heavenward and earthward.
The question is, What do I see? What is in the newspapers, or the circle where all the thoughts of God can be known in their fulness? Every thought that God had in His mind at the beginning? Peter speaks of "precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, the blood of Christ, foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world" (@1 Peter 1: 19, 20). That was long before @Exodus 12. What God had in His mind then was that He was going to have a people brought to Himself. I was very thankful once to think that God was outside, happy because God could not reach me in His judgment. How different to know that "Christ indeed has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God" (@1 Peter 3: 18). We want to get more and more into the thoughts of God and escape from the thoughts of men; it is the only way of blessing. A great many are glad that God cannot reach them in His judgment, but that is not the truth. The truth is that all the blessing starts in the heart of God, not that Christ comes in to rescue us from God. What a difference! The first time, the passover was kept for shelter, but it was only once needed for shelter. We have not to keep it in one sense in that way as Christ has kept it for us. "By faith he (Moses) celebrated the passover and the sprinkling of the
{52}
blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn might not touch them" (@Hebrews 11: 28). Moses kept it for all Israel. The true Moses has really kept it for all who are brought to Him by the grace of God. The passover and the sprinkling of the blood stand in eternal blessedness for ever as the ground of our blessing with God.
Rem. We "keep the feast".
C.A.C. "For also our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed; so that let us celebrate the feast". There is a continual adding. What God gives you, you never leave behind. Did they leave the manna behind? No, they carried it over Jordan in the golden pot. They had a more blessed sense of what it was for God than ever they had in the wilderness. It was not needed for food then. We see the same thing with regard to Aaron's rod. The priestly grace of Christ that was needed in the wilderness is carried over in the ark. It remained with them in a divine way in the ark. God is never going to let me lose one single thought of Christ that I have ever had. I am never going to lose it. Although I may be freed from the pressures where I valued it first, I shall enjoy it in full for ever.
God never let the passover drop out. At each new step God brought it in. Its first celebration starts the year, the first year. "This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you" (@Exodus 12: 2). The second celebration takes place in the second year, "in the first month of the second year" (@Numbers 9: 1). How much more glorious was it than the first! Why? Because it is not now a question of judgment or the destroying angel but of God having taken up His dwelling. The tabernacle has been constructed according to His mind: it has been put together and set up, and the glory has come down. It is God's pleasure to be near to His people, and the first thing He would have them do is to hold the passover. And when He speaks of this second passover, He says of it, "Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with
{53}
leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my feast remain all night until the morning" (@Exodus 23: 18; see also chapter 34: 25). That refers to the passover. In @Exodus 12: 5 it is spoken of as "your lamb", what you need for shelter, but now it is "my sacrifice, my feast". It is not "the fat" in @Exodus 12, it is all about the blood there.
Ques. Does "the fat" speak of the excellence of Christ?
C.A.C. When we come to "the fat" we are getting more to God's side of it, His own thoughts about it. We may have kept the feast in the fourteenth day of the first month of the first year, but have we kept it in the fourteenth day of the first month of the second year? God has not only taken us up to meet our need perfectly and divinely but to bring us to His thoughts of Christ. What a feast for God! He is carrying everything out through that "Lamb slain"; the book of life is connected with it in @Revelation 13: 8, "Whose name had not been written from the founding of the world in the book of life of the slain Lamb".
Ques. When God says, "My sacrifice", is He referring to what He sacrificed?
C.A.C. It is His own delight in it rather, His delight in what comes about by the death of Christ, the fat of the Lamb. The blood speaks of the life given, meeting what is due to God. "The fat" would speak to us of the excellence of Christ such as God alone could estimate it. "All the fat shall be Jehovah's" (@Leviticus 3: 16), but "the blood shall be for you as a sign" (@Exodus 12: 13). No one but the blessed God could measure what the fat speaks of.
Ques. As to @Philippians 3: 8, "The excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord", how would that fit in?
C.A.C. We see that God has got it first, and that stirs up our hearts to want it for ourselves. Paul was throwing what was gain to him behind him there. Everything else, apart from the excellency of that knowledge, was dross and dung. All that could commend Paul he throws aside. He
{54}
says, as it were, 'I have seen another Person. His love holds me fast'. In the embrace of that love he is prepared to throw everything else overboard. You come to keeping the feast, for you cannot eat the passover without keeping the feast because they are both one (@Luke 22: 1). Nothing is to have any place with you but Christ. All that would give me a place has to go.
Rem. I have known a lovelier One.
C.A.C. All this fits in with the light of the glory of the tabernacle. Everything in it spoke of Christ. "Let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them". All the material came out of the hearts of the people. It was all a free-will offering. One had gold, another silver, and so on; all came from their side. God has taken us up to put valuable substance into our souls; He has put Christ there.
In every saint God has put spiritual substance so that we can contribute to His dwelling-place. We understand the blessing of God's dwelling-place by contributing towards it the knowledge of Christ that we have. There are thousands of contributors. The way that God is working at this present time is that He puts the knowledge of Christ into the hearts of His people and thus we fit together. We should fit together beautifully if we only gave place to Christ.
Rem. "That they may be all one" (@John 17: 21 ).
C.A.C. "One in us", one in the knowledge of divine Persons. Divisions come in because we do not give place to divine Persons. The only way to unity is to let that which is of God and of Christ enter our hearts; then all that is of God and of Christ in one will fit with all else that is of God and of Christ, and thus we arrive at God dwelling; His people are round Him and near Him and learning the passover as God's feast. The more we get increased, the more power there is for the practical refusal of the flesh, and the more power there is to keep the feast. How are we keeping it? In the light of Egypt or of the tabernacle, God dwelling? If I am keeping it in the light of God dwelling I shall have great
{55}
power. What I know of God and of Christ becomes great power for keeping the feast, so that we get rid of the leaven in that way. In the sense of what the passover is to God, there is power in the soul to purge out what marked us in our unconverted days. "Not with old leaven". Whatever taste we had in our unconverted days reasserts its power if we get away from God. Then there are also personal feelings, "the leaven of malice and wickedness", but we have power by the Spirit to refuse the leaven and bring in the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. If we were content to be what the grace of God had made us, we should be happy. The apostle could say, "By God's grace I am what I am" (chapter 15: 10). Let me be what the grace of God would make me. "In simplicity and sincerity before God, (not in fleshly wisdom but in God's grace,) we have had our conversation in the world" (@2 Corinthians 1: 12). They were like Christ. The question with us should not be 'What is right?' but 'What is like Christ?' We should be concerned to give expression to Christ.
Rem. We are often slow to recognise what is of Christ in one another.
C.A.C. An old brother used to say, 'It takes a lot of grace in one to see a little grace in another'.
There is a great difference between the passover as kept in Egypt and that kept after the sanctuary had been made, setting forth all that God had found in Christ. The saints are now "the true tabernacle, which the Lord has pitched, and not man" (@Hebrews 8: 2). Exercises with regard to holiness are most important. "The temple of God is holy, and such are *ye*". There should be great exercise with us to maintain holiness.
Rem. And all is to be "according to the pattern".
C.A.C. Some Christians ask whether certain things are left to our discretion or not. The answer is, 'Nothing'. Everything was done with regard to the tabernacle "as Jehovah had commanded Moses". Every ring and pin was
{56}
made as God required it. If that was so in regard of the type, the shadow, how important now in regard of the substance that all should be according to "the Lord's commandment" (@1 Corinthians 14: 37). There is to be no allowance of contamination or defilement. Hezekiah commenced by cleansing the house of Jehovah, "And the priests ... carried forth all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of Jehovah" (@2 Chronicles 29: 16). It was all cleared out and in view of keeping the passover also. They could not keep it for the pleasure of God except in holiness. There is a lack with us of keeping the feast. We are not sufficiently exercised about it and therefore we have not much access into the mind of God.
Ques. Is to "keep the feast" a perpetual thing with us?
C.A.C. "Seven days". We work as Christians by the week. We begin the week on the first day by eating the Lord's supper. The Lord ate the passover with His disciples and brought in new thoughts in connection with it. We eat it now in the light of all that the Lord has added to it.
The third passover was kept in a new position over Jordan and in the land, and in new conditions -- after circumcision.
Ques. Has the passover a burnt-offering aspect?
C.A.C. The burnt-offering is introduced in connection with passovers observed in the days in Hezekiah and Josiah. In fact, in one passage the Spirit of God seems to speak of the passover as "the burnt-offerings" (@2 Chronicles 35: 14). It was provided for in @Numbers 28: 19 - 24, "besides the continual burnt-offering ... after this manner shall ye offer daily ... two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven yearling lambs", etc. It is a wonderful setting forth of the excellence of Christ as the burnt-offering. We shall get a multiplied apprehension of the death of Christ as we begin to keep the feast.
Rem. "And their oblation" also.
C.A.C. You get a sense of the delight of God in
{57}
connection with the death of Christ, "an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour" (@Ephesians 5: 2). God is enriched. The sin-offering meets His claims but the burnt-offering enriches Him beyond measure and He wants us to know Him as thus enriched. The meat-offering is not offered in connection with atonement, but in connection with His perfect devotion to God as the obedient, dependent Person, "fine flour".
Rem. Also "oil" and "wine".
C.A.C. Oil denotes that everything was in the power of the Spirit, but the wine was poured out in the sanctuary. You can pour something out for God. And in Hezekiah's day there is the addition of "cymbals, with lutes and with harps" and "at the moment the burnt-offering began, the song of Jehovah began" (@2 Chronicles 29: 25 - 30). And it is a long time before the burnt-offering is finished, "all night unto the morning". And we know the day that is going to break very soon when the glory of the Lord will cover the earth. Now, continually, we can send it up "all night". "It shall never go out" (@Leviticus 6: 13). The Spirit will maintain the affections of the saints for Christ. God will keep up the line of faith.
The greatest passover of all was when the Lord sat down with His disciples. It is said of the passover held in the days of Josiah, "And there was no passover like to that holden in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel hold such a passover as Josiah held" (@2 Chronicles 35: 18). But now, it is since the Lord was here. There was the sweetness of companionship in it: "With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer". If He valued it then, does He not value it now? They were those given Him of the Father, their affections were bound up with Him: "Lord, to whom shall we go?" He sits down with them and connects (in Matthew and Mark) the loaf and the cup with the passover. In Luke they are separated or, rather, distinguished from it, His body
{58}
given and His blood shed in relation to the new covenant. But in Matthew and Mark the thought of the passover is given fulness to. The Lord brought out a new glory and put it on the passover, and it will never be disconnected from it. Even in the millennium it will always have the character that the Lord gave it. God's people on earth in a coming day will see the whole pleasure of God accomplished. The Lord brought in a new element, a cup which is not connected with the passover in the Old Testament.
Ques. I suppose "this do in remembrance of me" (@Luke 22: 19) is peculiar to us?
C.A.C. The assembly is in view. "This is my body which is given for you". It is the peculiarly blessed way in which the church enters into it. We have it in a better way than Israel will ever have. We understand the fulness of God's thought in the passover -- what God has found -- and that has been furnished to Him in Christ in both the bread and the cup. "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you". It is a cup into which we drink, filled with all the love of God.
Ques. Would you connect it with @Psalm 16: 5, "Jehovah is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup"?
C.A.C. It was His portion as Man on earth and thus His cup -- unbroken joy in the love of God, His own personal portion, as He says, "That they may have my joy fulfilled in them" (@John 17: 13). What could be more blessed than to have His portion? God introduces a thought in connection with our need first, but He adds to it, and it becomes bigger and bigger until the Son comes and brings in the fulness of the divine thought, and we are set in it.
Ques. "The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage". Does that give us a thought of the Lord's joy?
C.A.C. It is His joy, what He acquires. He wanted it and He has got it, present possession of the assembly
{59}
(@Ephesians 5: 25 - 32). Someone may say, 'But what if there are only two or three of us?' Never mind, you can have the substance of it. There is no reason why two or three should not minister to Him. It is one loaf and one cup. If ninety-seven out of one hundred do not respond, it need not hinder the three. "And the whole congregation of the assembly of Israel shall kill it" (@Exodus 12: 6), as if there were only one. And Hezekiah speaks of it being "for all Israel" (@2 Chronicles 29: 24). "The cup ... which we bless". How big is that "we"? Is not there room in it for every saint? "The bread which we break". God supposes that every Christian does it. "*We* have all been baptised into one body ... and have all been given to drink of one Spirit" (@1 Corinthians 12: 13) is the whole church of God. It is heartbreaking that so many are not there when we come to break bread, but two persons can hold the truth of God's assembly for the whole church. The testimony consists in holding the truth for the whole assembly. The whole assembly will come out in the value of the truth in the day of glory. Some may then say, 'But, Lord, we have known nothing of it before', and He will answer, as it were, 'I had a few faithful souls holding it for you all the time'. I feel inclined to say to believers sometimes, 'I have valuable property in my possession that belongs to you and as soon as you put in a claim to it, the better will I be pleased'. The truth belongs to all saints. Anything not according to the truth is a lie. I want to be identified with the truth, not with a lie. You hold the truth as a steward for all saints. It is a great honour to hold it as the heritage of His people.
Rem. It is said of some in @1 Chronicles 11: 14 that "they stood in the midst of the plot and delivered it ... ;and Jehovah wrought a great deliverance".
{60}
NOTES OF A READING @1 CORINTHIANS 6: 1 - 20
C.A.C. The effect of the teaching was to give the saints a very true sense of their dignity. There is more capacity really in the saints to judge of things rightly than in the highest court of justice.
Rem. It seems to make the assembly the highest tribunal.
C.A.C. Yes, and not only the assembly but the saints individually. "There is not a wise person among you", he says, which shows that matters of judgment connected with this life are not supposed to come before the assembly, which is instruction for us. They are matters to be reserved to wise men. 'Have not you a wise man among you?' Paul says. "Set those to judge"; that is, it is by appointment. The assembly deputes one or more to go into it and adjudicate it. In Israel, in every ten persons there was one who was qualified to decide matters. If it was so in Israel, there would not be less competency in the assembly. It does not suppose here that these matters are brought to the assembly, but the assembly appoints those to adjudicate, so the matter does not become a matter of general discussion, or perhaps of personal feeling. It is the wisdom of God, so it is settled, so to say, out of court. If they cannot find a wise man, "set those to judge who are little esteemed in the assembly" (verse 4).
To decide a dispute between one brother and another calls for an intense degree of spirituality. What the apostle is at throughout the whole epistle is to form spirituality in the saints. It makes a great demand on me to be in a spiritual condition, and that is a great help to me. We then shall possess those features in a substantial way. Sometimes we are baffled by feeling our incompetency; but it is a great call to spirituality. It is a great exercise for us all. If we take
{61}
up in prayer and worship the great things of God, and we do, are we not competent to decide a dispute as to matters of this life? But all this is to lift us up to our true dignity as the people of God.
Rem. "The elders" are mentioned in @Revelation 5.
C.A.C. What is represented in the elders is maturity of judgment, and that is characteristic of the assembly. Such matters were to be considered by two or three wise men, and if that principle had been adhered to, it would have saved the saints much distraction. We could not walk with or be in fellowship with anyone who acted in this way and went to law. Now we have had the instruction, we know such action is altogether against the dispensation of grace. But at the same time Paul does not mince matters: such persons will not inherit the kingdom of God (verse 9); it is an absolute principle. I ought to be afraid to do something wrong, because then I am not practically in the kingdom of God! But such a matter must be settled righteously. Why should I want to be vindicated? Not to contest my rights -- that is the path of liberty. Thus the individual can leave his matters in the hand of the Lord, and it is not necessary for him to seek his own justification. But it is not so with the assembly, the assembly could not let things pass. It shows that God's way of handling things is the wiser and the best way.
A person walking in self-judgment and in the Spirit does not make a false judgment, as a general principle. It exposes my state if I do. It is a test in subjection too. The principle of government in Israel would only work on the ground of subjection, and no principle of government in Scripture will work under any other condition. A person without subjection is not fit for the assembly.
Rem. "But ye have been washed ..." (verse 11).
C.A.C. Now that is what has operated.
Ques. What is justification "... by the Spirit of our God"?
{62}
C.A.C. Does not it bring out the wonderful character of the working of God in His people? It is very important to take note of it, that the Spirit of God enters into all in this matter. It is the working of God in the matter, so the saints are morally cleansed from all the pollution around them, and the Spirit and the name of our God enter into it. The divine thought was that they should be freed from all that characterised them naturally; and he brings the highest motives to bear even on the basest and vilest lusts of the flesh.
Ques. It would not be right for a believer to bring anyone before the world's court either, would you say?
C.A.C. We used to be told the apostle did not say anything about that possibility, because he did not conceive such a thing possible!
The last section of the chapter has to do with our bodies, and it is summed up in, "glorify now then God in your body". The body is for the Lord, a vessel to be disposed of by the Lord; and the bodies of the saints are members of Christ; they are to be vessels through which Christ is to be expressed. He has no other vehicle of expression in this world but the bodies of the saints; so it dignifies the bodies of the saints! And the saints are "joined to the Lord" (verse 17). What wonderful elevating realities are brought in in regard to our mortal bodies, because all this refers to our mortal bodies. "He that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit"
(verse 17). It is a remarkable introduction of the marriage thought in connection with the bodies of the saints. It is an individual matter: "He that is joined to the Lord". It is worked out in the holiness of individual believers. There is the thought of being actually joined to the Lord, the most intimate link possible, of the individual believer who is in a mortal body, with the Lord. It involves a personal nearness and intimate contact with the Lord -- "joined to the Lord".
There is no other scripture I know of like it. "Members of the Christ" (verse 15) shows that the bodies of the saints are
{63}
the vehicles through which Christ is expressed; they are not to be used in the expression of self-will, or unrighteousness in any form. It rules out, by the highest possible consideration, the gratification of the body. In the presence of this, how can you entertain the thought of bringing your body into contact with anything vile? It is inconceivable! When it is a question of being joined to the Lord it is a spiritual matter. "He that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit", and that is true of the believer when he is still in the body.
Another motive is that purchase has come in; it is an unrighteous matter to indulge the flesh. Our bodies are the Lord's, the price has been paid for them. So a chain of most wonderful statements are brought in to counteract the lowest and basest things you can think of. "Joined to the Lord", would be an affectionate personal intimacy with Him. We read (@Acts 11) that certain persons "turned to the Lord"; certain persons were exhorted to "abide with the Lord"; and some were "added to the Lord"; but this is intimate contact with the Lord in relation to the body. It is the marriage figure that is in his mind, but he applies it not to the assembly, but to the individual.
The first part of @Romans 7 would come in here. God would have us conscious of an affectionate link with the Lord, as husband and wife are conscious of an affectionate link with each other. It is with the Lord in a marriage sense; it is only as we are conscious of that, that we shall understand the marriage links that exist between Christ and the assembly. There is nothing more wonderful than the way that here the highest possible considerations are brought to bear on the lowest dangers that attack us through the flesh.
{64}
"JOINED TO THE LORD"
@1 Corinthians 6: 17
"Joined to the Lord" is a very striking expression -- "He that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit". Paul had spoken of the body as being "for the Lord" (verse 13); He has an exclusive right to it as over against any unclean association. Our bodies are members of Christ, which is a wonderful exaltation of the body; the mortal bodies of the saints are members of the anointed and exalted Man, and this is brought in to correct the debased filthiness of those who had recently come out of the corruption of the heathen world. And in this same connection Paul speaks of the individual believer as "joined to the Lord". It is evident that the marriage bond is in his mind; he would have each believer to know that he is in this bond with the Lord. As members of Christ the "body" conception is before us; our bodies are for the expression of Christ; but being joined to the Lord is the way by which we are brought into vital oneness, one Spirit with Him. I do not remember that the thought of being joined to *the Lord* is found in any other scripture, and it is presented as an individual matter. The people at Lydda and the Saron "turned to the Lord"; at Joppa "many believed on the Lord"; at Antioch "a great number believed and turned to the Lord". Barnabas exhorted all "with purpose of heart to abide with the Lord".
We read that "a large crowd of people were added to the Lord". But something more intimate is suggested in being "joined to the Lord"; it is a personal bond entered into which is comparable to the marriage relation, and which results in spiritual oneness -- the individual is "one Spirit" with the One to whom he is joined. It is truly a wonderful thought.
{65}
NOTES OF A READING @1 CORINTHIANS 7: 1 - 40
C.A.C. All these instructions are most important, and never more so than in the present day when lawlessness abounds, even in the christian profession. But christian liberty is preserved as we submit ourselves to divine instruction.
Rem. The apostle handles things with great delicacy of touch, not to bring the saints into bondage (see verse 25). He says, "I think" twice over.
C.A.C. No, it is not laid down exactly in an authoritative manner. It is in divine wisdom that most of the subjects should be presented to us as the products of a spiritual man, who could say he had God's Spirit. And it was true, and all is by the inspiration of the Spirit; it is not that it has not authority. Christianity is a spiritual system, and matters have to be decided spiritually. Almost the only thing in the chapter that is said to be a definite command of the Lord is that the wife should not leave her husband, nor the husband his wife. That is the Lord's authority, there is no appeal against that! There was great disorder and looseness of morals at Corinth, and all is corrected with exquisite delicacy of touch. It is all in view that the saints should be in liberty and without distraction. On the other hand, some were underrating marriage. There was a line of ascetic teaching, forbidding to marry, which is a doctrine of demons. An earthly people would regard, I suppose, that not to marry would be to suffer disability, but Paul shows that such do not suffer any disability -- that is a comfort! He leaves the whole thing in liberty, he puts no one in bondage, what is done is done in liberty. So that a Christian can be perfectly happy and perfectly free with the Lord without the marriage tie. The apostle was not married, and I think he was perfectly happy, indeed in this chapter he
{66}
rather hints that it is good. He is careful to show that there is no disability with it. He was superior in spiritual power to what was right naturally. It was quite right, but there was a possibility of being superior to it in devotion to the Lord.
So that if marriage is not granted to every one of us, we need not regard it as any drawback, and there have been many thousands with whom this has been so. It is a great comfort to see there need be no spiritual loss; it may be a gain. To be entirely freed for the Lord and untrammelled by any natural relationship is really a better way of spending one's life.
Ques. "On account of the present necessity" -- what does that mean?
C.A.C. I think it is of general bearing. It is the time of Christ's rejection and reproach, when Christians do not look to have the best of both worlds. We have an extraordinary freedom at present, and marriage is God's ordering. There is a providential ordering in all these things, and it is not wise to set aside any of these things. If a brother or sister marry, we recognise the ordering of God in it and give them our fellowship. We should not like to think they were going to be worse Christians for that! He puts these verses in as a warning, not as a consequence.
Rem. Let "the younger (women) marry", he says (@1 Timothy 5: 14), in view of departure of the last days I suppose. To have mercy to be faithful seems the balancing point.
C.A.C. This chapter views the saints in the wilderness. This is not Colossians or Ephesians, where a greater dignity is given to the thought of marriage, and where the whole thing is carried on to a higher platform -- that of Christ and the assembly. Marriage belongs to the period before sin came in, and was purely the thought of God, and there was no thought of creature imperfections at all.
Then a woman who has an unconverted husband is not to be cast down, is she? There might have been many such;
{67}
but then he shows that the unconverted partner derives an advantage from it.
Rem. It seems difficult to understand that the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife etc., and the children holy.
C.A.C. That is why we have come here tonight. I think it gives us an insight into the mind of God. In such a case there is a certain advantage conferred on the unconverted partner; so he is not quite on the same footing as a man that is in the world. It is looked at much on the line of privilege. It is put in a remarkable way -- his conversion is to be looked for -- that she can save him. "For what knowest thou, O wife, if thou shalt save thy husband? or what knowest thou, O husband, if thou shalt save thy wife?" (verse 16). He does not say 'woman'; it shows God recognises the relationship. It is intended to encourage people in the possibility, and to let the unbeliever know that he is advantaged before God in having a believing partner. It is a special privilege connected with the marriage relationship -- he is sanctified in his wife.
And it says, "God has called us in peace" (verse 15); that is, the unconverted husband is to be thought of specially, and the wife is not to bring in anything to disturb the peace of the marriage relationship.
Rem. Peter speaks of husbands being gained by the conversation of the wives.
C.A.C. I have remarked all my life that when God converts one partner He almost invariably converts the other in time. The very ordering is God's, and this is specially so if they are God's elect, for every circumstance of their lives is ordered, and this is the greatest circumstance perhaps in any one's life. The whole chapter to my mind is full of spiritual encouragement. If the unbeliever, in spite of all the grace, departs, he says, "Let them go away", which is a very solemn thing. Marriage here is viewed on the lower plane -- on the natural plane.
{68}
In verses 17 - 24 the ordering of God is recognised in one's position as Jew or Gentile, or even as to one's occupation in life. One has to recognise the ordering of God in all these things. Take a man who is converted and his wife is not -- well, he has to recognise the ordering of God in it. So, if a slave, he is not to desire to alter it. If he has the opportunity to be free, he is at liberty to be free. But it does not matter very much, because the slave is the Lord's freedman, and the freeman is Christ's bondman. The thing that comes about in the ordering of God is the important thing. What we are occupied with (provided, of course, it is not in itself contrary to God), we are to continue in as the providential ordering of God. All is to make us content with where we are thus placed. We are not to want to change our occupation, as if we might be better Christians, or serve God better elsewhere. I am put in the circumstances in which I can best be a Christian, and if I cannot be a Christian there, I cannot be anywhere! If things bear a little hardly on me, well, that is not bad for me, indeed it may be a good thing, they may just touch me at the very spot where the Father sees there is need.
Rem. 'Do not change your location, or your vocation', J.B.S. said.
C.A.C. I suppose that is a large part of piety. Such saints are happy and more at liberty in their pathway, and get the advantage of it. We should so act in the natural sphere that we pass happily and freely into the spiritual sphere. Even a husband and wife leave the relationship behind them, and are as brother and sister in the spiritual sphere. This is the way a spiritual man takes account of the natural sphere, but he has in mind that we shall be at liberty for the spiritual sphere.
Ques. Is verse 32 what the Lord would love?
C.A.C. Yes, indeed! The Lord's word is, "Be careful about nothing". We need to be careful about nothing, "but in everything, by prayer and supplication with
{69}
thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God" (@Philippians 4: 6). Why should we carry any care? I often say to myself, how foolish I am to worry about something that only God can manage, and I have the liberty of taking it to Him! How this sphere of natural things tests us! We are always coming up against things that are difficult to us; but then it is the discipline of the Father's love, the very thing that is going to lift me up. He brings me down to the very thing that will lift me up. It makes more room for God. We want more room for God in our natural lives, and if this is brought about the assembly will gain. It is better to be with God in the greatest trial than to be in the greatest comfort without Him.
Ques. To depart and to be with Christ has its bearing today on us?
C.A.C. Yes. The enjoyment of the love of divine Persons is sweeter and greater than anything we could enjoy naturally. We should all sign our names to that.
Rem. David's knowledge of God enabled him to meet the Philistine.
C.A.C. It is beautiful to see in the Old Testament that God could make Himself such a reality to a young brother.
Ques. Was David the young brother?
C.A.C. Yes.
{70}
NOTES OF A READING @1 CORINTHIANS 8: 1 - 13
Ques. Is this one of the matters they had written to the apostle about?
C.A.C. It appears to be so. The Spirit of God seems to take advantage of imperfect conditions to bring out very high and exalted truths. The very degraded habits of the Corinthians, into which even believers are likely to fall, were the means of bringing out the truth that they were the holy temple of the Spirit, and members of the body of Christ.
Ques. Why does it say, "Knowledge puffs up"?
C.A.C. It is a case where knowledge might even make people careless of their associations. There was a danger of knowledge and personal right to do things turning to a snare -- that is, the very knowledge that an idol was nothing might make a man say, 'It does not matter if I go and eat meat in an idol's temple; it means nothing'. But the apostle brings out that it may mean a weak brother is stumbled. If my liberty is injurious to another, it is a good opportunity for me to use self-restraint. "Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies".
This very question leads the apostle to develop in a very remarkable way the truth in relation to God, the truth of the economy of revelation (verse 6). It is one of the most comprehensive verses of the Bible.
I suppose these verses show a danger of the Corinthians, and of us all, of putting too much value on knowledge in contrast to formation in the divine nature. I may know a great deal more than some believer in Teignmouth, yet he may be more formed in the divine nature, and he is the better man of the two! Paul says, for instance, we all know that an idol is nothing, and so a christian might use that knowledge to go and have a meal in an idol temple. Love is
{71}
the great building power. A man full of divine love would edify those he comes in contact with more than a man full of knowledge.
Ques. Why does it say, "If any one love God, *he* is known of him"?
C.A.C. The knowledge of God -- that is what God cares about. Not knowledge about Him from the Scriptures, that does not call forth God's recognition. That is, He takes account of where people's affections really are towards Him. God is not occupied at all with the amount of knowledge we have. Such are known of Him. He speaks in the Old Testament of "thousands of them that love me", even in Israel, and in Elijah's time He had seven thousand. Those are the people God takes account of -- He knows them.
Ques. Can we be conscious of it?
C.A.C. Oh yes, every one that loves God is conscious of it.
Rem. David said, "Thou knowest my down-sitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off" (@Psalm 139: 2).
C.A.C. That was the divine searching; in that sense He searches every one, nothing is hidden from Him. David knew God, and did not shrink from divine searching. He was afraid of himself, and so he asked God at the end of the psalm, "Search me, O God, and know my heart; prove me, and know my thoughts; And see if there be any grievous way in me; and lead me in the way everlasting" (verses 23, 24).
Here it is that the revelation has had its proper effect upon man. God has loved man that He should be loved by man, and where the revelation is received, that is the result. It is a very precious thought that God has come out in His beloved Son; and we are so affected by it that we respond to Him and we love Him.
Later on in this epistle he could tell us that what is offered to idols is offered to demons. It applies in principle
{72}
now to any place that represents a system that is not according to divine truth. We see great buildings, and these buildings represent certain systems of things that are not according to the truth. We do not want to mislead other people. I would not like to go anywhere where it would not be good for another to go.
Ques. Would you say more about verse 6?
C.A.C. That brings in what would effectually set aside idolatry. If God and the Lord Jesus Christ have Their place with us, we have done with idolatry, and really with everything that is not in accord with the revelation, because that is how it stands today.
God has come out as the Source of everything that is good and blessed. He has come out in that character, and in relation to a world of evil, and where men's hearts are full of distrust of Him. He has come out as the Source of every good; that is, God the Father is the Source of everything.
Rem. "Now they have known that all things that thou hast given me are of thee" (@John 17: 7).
C.A.C. I think some have a kind of undefined feeling that the Lord Jesus is the Source of everything, but the distinction is clearly made in these verses that God the Father is the Source, and the Lord Jesus the Channel, and the One through whom we derive everything, so that we may be in the happiest relations with God, "of whom are all things, and *we* for him". And when we speak of God we refer to the Father.
Ques. Knowledge will not bring me there, but love *will*.
C.A.C. Yes, the Lord Jesus is a divine Person and in that sense equal with the Father as to His deity, but He has taken up a certain position as the Mediator, so that all that is in the heart of God might be carried into effect, and that through Him we might have a most blessed place with God.
Ques. What are the "all things"?
C.A.C. The "all things" are the "all things" known in
{73}
the present economy. I think it refers to what is known in the economy of grace. It supposes that the Lord Jesus Christ is a glorious Man at the right hand of God. We have to do with these two blessed divine Persons. God the Father is the Source of everything -- every blessing that has come to us. It all comes from Him in love and goes back to Him in love, but it is through the Lord Jesus that it comes to us. We see that everything that has come out in the Lord Jesus is the expression of the Father -- the words He spoke and the works He did too. He could say, "He that has seen me has seen the Father" (@John 14: 9).
Ques. How far does the thought of Mediator come into this?
C.A.C. That is just what enters into the whole thought of the Lord Jesus Christ. There is one God; that is, the Father -- the Father is the Source of everything. It was the Father who sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world. The fact that the Lord was here in holy manhood was wholly of the Father -- that He should send the Son to be the Saviour of the world. That is very important, because of the worship in the assembly of the Father and the Son too, but there is also the peculiar glory that attaches to Him as the Mediator.
Ques. Why is the Mediator necessary for the revelation of the Father?
C.A.C. Well, the revelation of the Father is clearly mediatorial. Christ has come into the place of manhood that He might mediate to men all the grace and love of God, and that He might be the Revealer of the Father.
Rem. In Hebrews He is "mediator of a new covenant" (chapter 12: 24).
C.A.C. The mediatorship of the covenant is a special part of His mediatorial service. When He presents to us the cup of the new covenant He is taking a mediatorial place. "This cup is the new covenant"; it is as Mediator He says that.
Here what He has in mind is those who have come into
{74}
the light of the revelation. In Corinth there was the assembly of God. They had received Christ and the Spirit, and they were in the light of the revelation of God.
Rem. "And *we* for him", it says (verse 6).
C.A.C. And that will be the ultimate result, that the saints will be entirely for the pleasure of God. If He sets the home ringing with merriment because of one returning son, what will it be with many? The returned son would have had a very blessed sense that he was for the father. All that was in the Father's heart has come out to us by the Son, and believers are presented before God according to the value of His Person, His redemptive work, and His place on high. All that we have by Christ; we bring nothing to God but what we have derived from Christ. And He has come into a place in the presence of God in which He can have the saints along with Him.
I was thinking only yesterday that in one sense there is nothing higher than the attitude of subjection. We are learning it under the Father's discipline. All the terrible pressure coming upon the children of God in the world is teaching this, because subjection is going to be our place eternally. The Son is going to be in subjection eternally, and the saints are going to be with Him in that place eternally. The Father's chastening in @Hebrews 12 is to bring us to the place of subjection, and we only acquire it in that way. And we are acquiring it to be suited companions of the Son throughout eternity. God's chastening always touches the will; we should have none if we had no will. J.B.S. said that we could easily discern what part of our nature was most likely to be active, for the Father is always touching that part. But if we take up the attitude of subjection the difficulty is gone, and we have acquired something for eternity.
God was revealed in One who never did His own will, never spoke His own words. It is a wonderful thing that God is going to have many sons patterned after Christ, is it
{75}
not? So that we have constantly to consider what has come to us from God through the Lord Jesus Christ, and all He has brought to pass. We shall see that we have come into a system where there is no flaw, and full of divine glory. His work is without a flaw, and the place we have with Him before God is divinely perfect.
"One God, the Father ... . and one Lord, Jesus Christ" is exclusive of all idolatry, the contrast to "gods many, and lords many". You see, these divine Persons are so great, that if They really get possession of the heart, They shut out everything else.
Rem. It is God and the Lamb in Revelation.
C.A.C. The distinction between divine Persons will be maintained eternally. Everything for us depends on the distinction, because it needed that a divine Person should come in to undertake for us, and He had set us in the highest and most blessed place in the family that a creature could possibly be in with God.
I do not know any scripture that is more comprehensive than this one. The greatest things possible in relation to God and Christ are brought in to counteract the action of one going into an idol house to eat meat. So it is all along in this epistle; he brings in the whole universe of God, and the principle of headship in the whole universe of God, to settle the question as to whether a woman should have her head covered. But if we want really to be happy, we must have divine Persons before us, and the way that divine Persons have moved in relation to us.
The weak brother comes entirely under the system of idolatry, and he will perish as going back to the very system he has come from. See what he says in verse 11. It is very touching, that. I would not like to do anything to stumble a person "for whose sake Christ died".
{76}
KNOWN OF GOD
@1 Corinthians 8: 6
There could be nothing greater or of more practical importance than the place that God and Christ have in our affections. Paul speaks in the opening verse of @1 Corinthians 8 of the contrast between knowledge and love, and it is important to note this. He says, "We all have knowledge"; that is, we know a good deal about God, but that does not give us recognition with God. "But if any one love God, *he* is known of him". We may know a great deal, but we should be concerned to be marked by that which God values and readily acknowledges. "If any one love God, *he* is known of him": there is something there that God can recognise; God can only truly delight in a nature that suits Him. I may say, I know God and I know the Lord, but the question of real importance is, Does the Lord know me? Is there anything in me that God can recognise as being of Himself?
The epistle to the Romans shows the wonderful way in which God has approached us in grace. He has set forth His righteousness, and His grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. He has made Himself known as the Justifier and the Deliverer; He has given us the Holy Spirit, who has shed abroad His love in our hearts and who witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God. The result is that we love Him; God gets a place in our affections.
What is written in verse 6 is of importance, "Yet to us there is one God, the Father". The apostle is referring to those who love God. There is on earth a company, the product of divine love, to whom the blessed God has become an object of affection. This alone will deliver us from idolatry, which is a terrible snare -- not perhaps in the gross form in which it was found in Corinth, though there are still "gods many, and lords many". There are many influences in the
{77}
world that are always bidding for a place in the hearts of men; the christian company is to be found in complete separation from these, and that separation is brought about by the place which the one God and the one Lord hold in the heart.
We may never have given God the place due to Him, but if we were to take into account who He is, and what His nature is, and how He proposes to satisfy His love, we would love Him with all our heart!
It is important to weigh the words in verse 6; it is not there what God is in Himself, but what He has become to those who love Him: "To us there is one God, the Father, of whom all things, and *we* for him". This involves the whole delight of God in man, the making known of His love to us, and His proposal to find His delight in us eternally -- "*We* for him". "Of whom all things" brings God before us as the blessed One who originated thoughts for His own pleasure before even He commenced the work of creation, which had in view the satisfaction of the love of God. All that He proposed utterly failed in connection with the first man and his race -- all broke down; sin and death came in; but that could not change what was originally in the thought of God: He could not give up the satisfaction of His love.
Scripture shows that this was in mind when it speaks of wisdom rejoicing before Him and delighting in the habitable part of His earth. God's delight, the satisfaction of His nature, would be found in men. A universe created in wisdom alone would not suffice God. The realisation in our souls that we are necessary for the delight of the love of God would give us to be marked by great dignity.
We are not occupied with the way God is for us, but with the wonderful way God is for *Himself*. "Of whom all things" -- everything that will satisfy the love of God is of Himself -- and then the wonderful words are added, "*We* for him". Oh, the delight of God in men! This is the one God who is held in affectionate regard by those who love Him.
{78}
It is in that character that we love Him; we hold Him in our affections as the One who has proposed to satisfy His own heart of love to the full. Men are necessary for this; He must have men; no other order of being, however exalted, could satisfy the love of God. And we are those who have been called and brought to the knowledge of God through grace so that we might afford Him that peculiar satisfaction which His love seeks. To see this secures a place for the blessed God in the affections of men; it forms the intelligent spring of the Spirit's cry, "Abba, Father".
The fact that we are for Him covers every phase of our position and relationship with God; whether we think of ourselves as bondmen, as children, as priests, or as sons, we are for God. Every position in which divine love has set us is for the satisfaction of God. If we all understood this, it would produce a profound effect on us.
The Father is the Source and Spring of everything. He is the Originator of every purpose and counsel of love, but the Son became Man -- the "one Lord" -- in order to effectuate everything. The one Lord is Jesus Christ; Jesus, the anointed Man; a divine Person in manhood. He is to be held in affection as the One by whom are all things. When we come to the one Lord, it is "by whom are all things, and we by him". The understanding of the wonderful service and activity that He has taken up for the pleasure of God causes us to give Him His place as Lord, for all that the pleasure of God proposed has been entrusted to the one Lord to be carried out by Him.
"One Lord" is in contrast with many lords; there are many influences in the world, but the one Lord is exclusive. If He is held in our affections as the one Lord in relation to all that is brought to pass by Him, He must be without a rival.
The creation of Adam in innocence did not suffice for the satisfaction of the love of God, because it did not bring out what God was in the depths of His nature. The presence
{79}
of lawlessness and death in the world has been the occasion for the display of the glory of the Lord; and now the one Lord is held in affection in millions of human hearts. When we speak of one Lord we have a majestic thought in mind, that of supremacy in dominion; no power of evil can stand before or challenge the one Lord. He desires to be held in the affections of the saints in His majesty and greatness as the one Lord. He came into a scene under ruin, and touched the creation that had become subject to vanity, and glorified God in doing it. He touched death with the touch of a conqueror; He rules over the dead and living. What a glorious Person He is!
His dominion is exercised in order that the love of God might be satisfied. The one Lord has proved His greatness -- the greatness of a divine Person in manhood. He dealt with lawlessness and death, and He has relieved us of all that was against us. He has exercised lordship in order that the love of God might be satisfied, and that by Him we might be placed in the presence of God for His satisfaction.
The one Lord came out of eternity, saying, "Lo, I come ... to do, O God, thy will" (@Hebrews 10: 7). That will is eternal in its character: it embraces more than the glories of the kingdom; it involves the fulfilment of all that the love of God proposed for its own satisfaction; and will have its culmination in eternity.
The distinctive glory of the Father is to originate purposes of love -- "Of whom all things". The distinctive glory of the Son is to give effect to those purposes -- "By whom are all things"; and it is by that blessed One that we are for God's pleasure at this moment, and shall be eternally.

NOTES OF A READING @1 CORINTHIANS 10: 15 - 22
C.A.C. We were noticing that faith is not sufficient if things are to be maintained. Without the Spirit, faith will decline. So the apostle calls attention to the saints that they are the temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwells in them and the temple of God is holy. We were seeing that in the temple of God we get much light as to Christ; everything in the temple speaks of Christ, and coming to the truth of the temple we get more light as to Christ. So in chapter 5 we have an increased knowledge of Christ; He is known as "our passover ... sacrificed". That means we have a spiritual view of Him and see Him not only crucified but sacrificed, which brings out the personal sufferings of His holy soul when He was typically roast with fire. By feeding on Him as the Lamb roast with fire we get strength to get rid of all leaven. So the exercise in chapter 5 is to purge out all leaven "that ye may be a new lump". Leaven is something that works inwardly causing us to be self-important, something in us that is not Christ. The assembly normally is unleavened, there is nothing active there but the life of Christ. It is only an unleavened company of persons who can truly eat the Lord's supper.
In chapter 10 we come to the thought of communion or fellowship. It is the question of the adjustment of our associations.
Rem. There was a young man in Malta who said his reason for coming to the meeting was because he found more of Christ there.
C.A.C. He was an "intelligent person" evidently as wanting more of Christ. Persons like that are suitable material for the assembly; if they want more of Christ they wish to eliminate what is not of Christ; we must begin personally as leaven works inwardly. "That ye may be a
{81}
new lump", that is what the assembly is; a leavened mass could not really be the assembly of God. Persons can go a long way on the line of exercise about themselves and their conduct without being much exercised as to their associations. I suppose every believer who is exercised about personal conduct may not be about associations; but if these are not right we cannot eat the Lord's supper.
We get the truth of associations in chapter 10 before the Supper in chapter 11. It would seem that at Corinth there were some who could go into an idol temple and eat what was offered, doing it on the principle that the idol was nothing and that it did not make any difference if it was offered to idols. But the question of association comes in, and the apostle shows that they were really in communion with demons. God is very concerned about the associations of His people and not only about our personal conduct. It is a serious matter to be going on with something that, in principle, is evil. A recognition of the true character of christian fellowship would save us from that. The apostle brings out the only kind of association that is contemplated for Christians. They are linked up with the communion of the body and blood of Christ -- it is an exclusive fellowship. Nothing could be more exclusive than the thought of the body of Christ and the blood of Christ. If we are associated with that, it entirely precludes any other kind of association. It says, "Ye cannot drink the Lord's cup, and the cup of demons"; "ye cannot", that is the true principle of all associations. It is not that there is anything narrow about it, it is a far greater and richer fellowship than any other kind of fellowship. He would impress that on us by speaking of the blood first, which is not in the order of the Supper. "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of the Christ?" He has in mind to give us a sense of the wealthy character and wonderful blessing of the christian association. It is well for us to look at it and see that it is the cup of blessing. He supposes that all believers
{82}
bless the cup and break the bread; the Scripture does not suppose that any Christian fails to do so. If he does not he can hardly be said to be occupying true christian ground. Such are not behaving like the believers in the beginning for they "persevered" in breaking of bread.
The blessing of the cup shows very clearly that we think very highly of it. There is nothing about drinking the cup here; it is blessing it, involving that we look at it. You look at it as a cup of blessing and you bless it. It supposes that all Christians do it. "The cup of blessing which we bless" -- he assumes it. He is hardly thinking of the cup in its literality but in its import. It is very large in its import and contains every blessing that comes to us in the death of Christ. In this chapter you look at it; it is a cup larger than any cup you ever thought of, and it contains the love of God that comes to us through the death of Christ. It shows the necessity for purging out all leaven, for it will obscure our vision of the cup. The thing to do is to get rid of the leaven. We see here the immensity of the cup of blessing and we are associated with all that. How can you associate yourself with this defiling world after that? It would be well if some of us came into fellowship! If we were to consider all that the cup speaks of, it would take several readings. It is a great study to consider the effect and result in blessing of the blood of Christ being shed.
Rem. *It is a feast* -- the feast of unleavened bread.
C.A.C. I am glad you called attention to that. It is not a *fast* of unleavened bread. When you can stamp out a little bit of leaven from yourself it is a happy day for you, as making more room for Christ. It is feeding on the holy, spotless Lamb that gives us power to eliminate the leaven that is so ready to be active in us. We shall never eliminate it in any other way.
When our associations have been adjusted, we shall be quite free for the Supper in chapter 11. Our leaven has been purged away and our old associations put away because of
{83}
the new associations we have entered upon, then we can sit down together to eat the Supper. It was not the Lord's supper that the Corinthians were eating. It is a very important point that the assets of the fellowship are put first -- the infinite gain that comes to us in the shedding of the blood of Christ. We then have no craving for any other associations among men. All of these propose some benefits, but what benefit can it give me if I am in the gain of the benefit of all that of which the cup speaks? It is a fellowship of supreme satisfaction.
Rem. There are worldly attractions as well as religious associations.
C.A.C. There are all kinds of things to ensnare us, but we shall have fewer desires for them as we come more and more into the knowledge of our associations.
Then the other important element of the fellowship is the bread: "The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of the Christ?" He suggests to us the thought of partaking. With the cup we are to look at it and bless it, but with the bread it is the thought of eating. The bread which we break -- you do not break bread except with the thought of partaking of it, and our object in partaking is that we may become an unbroken loaf ourselves. "We, being many, are one loaf, one body". In connection with the bread he distinctly brings forward the thought of partaking of it. It was when the bread was going to be partaken of that the Lord broke it. That gives us another view of the christian association or partnership. Christendom has got very used to the word "communion", and "fellowship" has become with us rather hackneyed, so it is good to use another word. It is a partnership -- a most wonderful one, and it brings out what corresponds with the cup of blessing. The blessing that is in the heart of God and in the love of God comes to us in the value of the blood of Christ, that is the side of blessing. But that necessitates something else and that is a moral character with us which corresponds with all the
{84}
blessing, and I think we reach that through the loaf.
The blood of Christ is a sacrificial thought and intimates the blessing that comes to us from God in the value of the death of Christ. It can never be less and it can never be more.
The body of Christ reminds us of what was in His body for the pleasure of God. It is the other side of the question. There was a Man here in a body, and that body was the vessel of God's pleasure from the manger right through to the cross, and most of all at the cross. We are to partake of the bread morally, we all partake of the one loaf. The exercise is important. To put it simply, it shows that the fellowship can only be taken up in the life of Christ, only in that character of life that was expressed in His body. There is a moral significance attaching to it -- a moral result. The partaking results in our being one loaf, one body. Every Christian normally wishes to move on that line, for we can only move on the line of the life of Christ or the line of the flesh. We can see what the life of Christ was in @Psalm 16, "Preserve me, O God: for I trust in thee". Is it not very attractive to think of partaking of it?
The psalmist goes on to say that his delight was in the saints, speaking of them as "the excellent ..., In them is all my delight". That is the life of Christ, and we delight in the saints too. As to the idolatrous world he says, "Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, and I will not take up their names into my lips". He will not touch the idolatrous world, and he finds his joy in God, he has his portion in God. That is all the life of Christ; it came out in His body that was given in death that we might partake morally of it, and then we shall come out as one bread. If this one is a partaker of the life of Christ and that one is a partaker of the life of Christ, if we are all partakers of the life of Christ, shall we not come out as one bread? That is the common partnership of the body of Christ. This is the association in which we are set today, and it is only as we are true to this
{85}
in principle that we are fit to eat the Lord's supper. We are not in a condition to eat the Supper otherwise. It is good for us to see what christianity is. Christianity is Christ. All this puts our associations right, we cannot touch any other kind of association. The more clearly we see what true christian fellowship is, the less we shall be influenced or attracted by any other kind of fellowship whether religious, political or social. They are altogether inferior and below what we have learnt to value. There are associations working for the benefit of man, and christians get drawn into them, but they are inconsistent with the true Christian fellowship, and if Christians learnt the true character of fellowship they would have to give them up.
Rem. There is the thought sometimes of doing things as an individual.
C.A.C. There is no ground in Scripture for any believer detaching himself from the company of his brethren. I have often referred to the young brother who was on a two-year cruise in the navy. He said to himself as he lay in his bunk the first night, 'I do not know that there is a single believer on this ship and I do not know that I shall see a single believer for two years, but how I behave myself on this ship will affect the fellowship all over the world'. If you go into wrong associations you take all the partners with you and it is inconsistent with the association in which God has set us in His great blessing.
{86}
THE LORD
@1 Corinthians 11: 20 - 32
It is to be noted that "the Lord" is mentioned seven times in these verses. It is a title which calls for reverence as setting forth that He is a divine Person. It is the word used in the New Testament to translate the word Jehovah from the Old.
Luke speaks of Jesus as "the Lord" more than all the other evangelists. I have no doubt it conveys that He was a divine Person. We may distinguish between "the Lord" as an official title and as a personal title. When Peter said, "God has made him, this Jesus ..., both Lord and Christ", he was presenting the official glory with which God has invested Him in contrast to their crucifying Him. But He was personally "the Lord" in the sense that He was a divine Person in manhood. He took a prepared body that He might give it in love for the assembly so that the assembly might be enriched with all that His incarnation brought in. And the cup is the new covenant in His blood. Who could consummate the new covenant but a divine Person? So the death of the Lord is a wondrous thing; He was "the Lord of glory". His supper can only be truly eaten in a worshipping spirit, as understanding that He is supreme because of who He is, but supreme in love when we think of what He has become, and how He has died. A living remembrance is kept up by those who love Him, but if there is not reverence and worship it is not the Lord's supper at all.
{87}
SUMMARY OF A READING @1 CORINTHIANS 11: 20 - 34
C.A.C. In coming together, each one should go away better than he came. We are not sufficiently exercised about coming together, especially as to the Lord's supper. The idea of a supper is a meal. Here it is not so much the Lord's supper as a lordly supper. It is a memorial to the world, not to the saints. I connected it with @Luke 14. Lordship now is connected with blessing and grace; He is the *Minister* of grace and blessing. In Luke you get what has been spoken of as heavenly grace, and in the Lord's supper you have access into all that. In the cup you have what is connected with heavenly grace. You get what is of Christ in contrast to what is of the world's system. The way you learn the love of God is in Christ. The divine idea is that you come together in a common festivity. In coming together in assembly it is properly to enjoy what God has given us.
No one has peace who has not reached a spot in his soul where there is nothing but Christ. The only cure for a dissatisfied state of soul is the ministry of Christ personally to the heart. But there must be surrender. It may come in different ways to different individuals but there must be surrender. The Lord takes occasion in a special way to minister Himself in the Supper. The coming of the Lord to His own is what marks the present time, and particularly when we come together. I think the Lord recognises a company on earth who love Him and cherish His company -- "I am coming to you". Christ's assembly derives from Himself; there is nothing in Christ's assembly but what is of Christ. People in a bad state would not know the presence of the Lord. I do not think people in a bad state would want the presence of the Lord. The Lord comes to those who want Him. "Behold, I stand at the door and am knocking" (@Revelation 3: 20) -- He waits to be invited. If we get
{88}
near the Lord we shall understand the character of the assembly as we could in no other way. You might get the whole meeting for a little moment into a sense of not being conscious of anyone else but the Lord. The test of everything in the meeting is, is it edifying? I think a meeting that is really in power has a distinct line, a character. I think it is a question of faith -- whatever is done is in faith. It ought to be a great reality to see that the Lord is here.
Ques. Should we have faith about what any brother does in the meeting?
C.A.C. You have confidence in your soul that it will please the Lord if you take a certain course. Slowness in the meeting is want of liberty.
{89}
NOTES OF A READING @1 CORINTHIANS 11: 23 - 26
C.A.C. It may be well just to say what we had before us on a previous occasion, namely the presentations in Mark's gospel and in Matthew's of the Lord's supper: the prominent feature in Mark is that the bread was to be taken, and in Matthew the prominent thought is that it was to be eaten; the thought of calling the Lord to mind does not have any place in these two gospels.
But when we come to the account in Luke of what took place in the presence of the twelve apostles, and the account given to us by Paul, which he received from the Lord that he might give it to the gentile assemblies, the thought of remembrance or calling to mind is, I suppose, the prominent thought of the service. So that we come to that particular aspect of this precious subject this afternoon.
Ques. Does Luke's account follow this?
C.A.C. Well, I think it is very likely that this account was the first one that was given to the assembly. It is a debatable matter, but it is probable that 1 Corinthians was written before Luke's gospel. This account distinctly places the Lord's supper in the assembly, does it not? It is important that the Lord's supper should not be seen as an individual privilege. Most believers perhaps regard it in this way. It is important that it should be seen as a collective matter -- it requires that the saints should come together. It is that He should be called to mind in a particular way, and requires that the saints should be together in order to do it.
There are comings together mentioned here. It was evidently possible, we find, to come together for the worse, but the proper object to be before the saints in coming together in assembly is to eat the Lord's supper.
Ques. Does it belong exclusively to the assembly?
C.A.C. Yes, we have no reason to think otherwise,
{90}
and the moral significance of the one loaf and the one body would confirm that thought.
Rem. Other families will take up other things, but not this.
C.A.C. I think that is so. It was for the collective calling of the Lord to mind, so that no amount of individual exercise or desire, prayer or study of the Scripture could take the place of it. There was evidently a custom in Israel of breaking bread for those who had died. We are all familiar with the scripture (@Jeremiah 16: 7). That scripture shows us it was customary to break bread and drink a cup in reference to those who had died. Now the Lord takes up that custom and glorifies it by giving it an entirely new setting. He gave it a new thought altogether, because the thought was that it was done in mourning. There is no such thing in the Lord's supper. When the Lord instituted it, He set aside all thought of mourning; it is a eucharist -- it is thanksgiving.
It is the Lord's desire to bring about a particular condition of mind in His saints collectively; that is the Lord's intent, and it is brought about by the breaking of bread and nothing else. If anything else would have done it the Lord would have used other means. Love is infinitely wise, and there is no better means than the Lord's supper to bring this about.
Ques. Is there not the thought of His sufferings?
C.A.C. *The Lord* did not mourn. No, the sufferings are not absent, but they are past. When the Lord instituted the Supper He was in mind beyond His sufferings and death. He spoke of His body given and his blood poured out, so they were all past in His mind.
Rem. To remember the Lord in His death is not a right expression.
C.A.C. No, I do not think that it is right, though it is often used and affectionately meant. But it cannot be established by Scripture.
{91}
Rem. The emblems represent a dead Christ, it has been said. We cannot dissociate them from His death.
C.A.C. Yes, His body is given and His blood poured out, that is clearly in death; but it is for a remembrance -- the calling of *Me* to mind.
Rem. His death is included.
C.A.C. Quite so. It is not Christ after the flesh that we call to mind, it is a living Christ known in love which has been expressed in death.
Rem. We are apt to be too historical. Mr Raven called attention to its being a remembrance, not a reminiscence.
C.A.C. Yes. No one will understand the Supper until he sees the Lord was anticipatively beyond His sufferings and death, and is now actually so, so that nothing remains but thanksgiving. In breaking the bread and drinking the cup there was nothing of mourning, it was an occasion of unmixed thanksgiving. The Lord says, 'Now, I want you to call Me to mind in that relation of things'. It was intended to bring about an attitude of mind in the saints of the assembly, so that they are positively unified in one mind, so that there is not a divergent thought. Is not that a wonderful thing?
We have been saying that there needs to be a constitution built up, so that assimilation precedes this. The eating and the drinking, I think, really preceded the calling of Him to mind.
Rem. It is remembrance of Himself.
C.A.C. It is "in remembrance of me" in relation to this particular act of breaking bread and giving thanks for the cup. The Lord says "This do" -- you *do* it, but do it for the calling of *Me* to mind. It is not a dead Christ; it is Christ beyond death. If we miss that, we miss it altogether. It has an active sense of calling to mind. He would have the assembly united in this wonderful way, all having Him in mind. The functioning of the assembly depends on this unity of mind.
{92}
Ques. What is the significance of when He was "delivered up"? It is not when He died.
C.A.C. I think the great moment of crisis had come. That was the thought: the great moment of crisis. He was just about to be actually delivered up and to go through suffering and death, but He anticipated it, having in mind that the saints were going to continue in the place where He was absent. In doing it the Lord regarded His own body as given and His blood poured out: He was anticipatively beyond His sufferings and death. He says, 'Now I want the saints of the assembly to call Me to mind in that manner'; we come into the apprehension of the love of the Christ that we know. As Christ is now, He has given His body for the assembly, and His blood has been poured out -- that is how we know Him. So the calling of the Lord to mind is not our individual thinking of Him in what He has done for us; we can do that all the week. There is this peculiar privilege of doing it collectively, so that all are unified, so that this blessed *Me* fills every mind.
That is the starting point of assembly privilege. We cannot move at all until we are all of one mind. It should have a pervading influence all the week, but there is a remembrance at the beginning of the week when the saints together experience this peculiar unity of mind, which brings all together, so that we merge. It is not like so many individuals. We are so intensely individual. I was looking last week through the epistles to find something of individual privilege or blessing and I found it very difficult to find any! It is so beautiful that the Lord unifies us in the calling to mind of something of which there cannot be a divergent thought. The Supper properly taken would absolutely abolish every bit of discord.
We see the importance of this matter to the Lord. He had given it officially in the presence of the twelve apostles, who represented the assembly administratively; but when He gives it from heaven it is almost a personal matter. It
{93}
is a personal communication to Paul. He cherished the thought of it and wanted it to be set amongst the assemblies, such as ourselves. We need to cherish the thought of the assembly, for it is the assembly that eats the Supper. A young person says, 'I should like to remember the Lord', but that is not quite the divine thought, there should be the thought of being identified with a certain company of persons.
We have been noticing that it is not until chapter 11 of this epistle that he speaks of the Supper, and morally we have to travel over the previous ten chapters, we cannot jump into the matter. He speaks of many and various matters before He comes to the Supper.
Rem. The Supper is introductory to what is coming.
C.A.C. I think the Lord had a good deal in view that He did not unfold to the Corinthians, because they were not ready for it. The apostle suggests that he has many things to add later on, but he brings in this great unifying power by the calling of the Lord to mind in this precious and distinctive way.
Ques. "The Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was delivered up" -- would it be suggestive of intense affection?
C.A.C. Yes. And yet the Supper was being brought in correctively. There was great disorder in Corinth, they were making it applicable to saints in whatever state they may be. They made it available to the most carnal believer on the face of the earth. The apostle speaks of their eating and drinking in a carnal way and even bringing judgment on themselves. It does not enter into the Supper at all.
Rem. I should like to be clearer as to the difference between blessing the loaf and giving thanks for it.
C.A.C. When the Lord blessed the loaf He gave it a new and spiritual import which never attached to any loaf before; but in giving thanks the Lord places Himself on ground where there was nothing to do but to give thanks -- it is not a mournful occasion. Tears shed over the Lord's
{94}
sufferings at the Supper are not pleasing to the Lord. It is not the right time and place. You can do that in your room, but do not bring tears into the assembly. It is a moment of thanksgiving, a joyful occasion.
It is important to notice that the whole service has the character of calling to mind from the giving thanks for the loaf, which is the beginning of the service, to the drinking of the cup, which is the end of the service of calling Him to mind. The Supper so gone through spiritually leaves the Lord filling every mind. That is the sort of material for the service of the assembly.
Ques. We have spoken of the Lord giving His body for the will of God, here it is "for you". Is it included in the thought of the will of God?
C.A.C. I think all that was accomplished for God in the giving of His body is conferred on the assembly -- the whole value of it. The whole value of the incarnation and the giving of His body in death is for the assembly, and we come to it afresh each Lord's Day. It is not that we do this Lord's Day what we did last, we come afresh. So you can understand how the assembly becomes suitable to the Lord.
It seems to me that a company of persons, fifty or so, who actually come together, find things become so unified that there is no divergent thought. And with all unified in thoughts of this wondrous Person, what is there to hinder the Lord coming to us? There is everything to attract Him! He may not come to us if we are not attractive to Him. I think that is sound doctrine. He fills every mind. The effect of the Supper has failed of its object if it does not fill every mind with Himself. Then, there is a clear course for the Lord, He does not keep away from those who attract Him. The spouse says, "The voice of my beloved! Behold, he cometh Leaping upon the mountains, Skipping upon the hills" (@Song of Songs 2: 8). He will come with the utmost speed if the conditions are there. The calling of Him to mind is with this in view. It is not for our comfort or 'a means of grace'
{95}
for us, though we shall assuredly get that. But the object is so to unify us that we are attractive, and the Lord says, I cannot keep away from that company. He will not keep away if these conditions are there. He comes as an Object of worship; He comes in all the greatness and wonderfulness of what He is as having given His body. Then the assembly's relation to Christ, and Christ's relation to the assembly can be developed affectionately.
Rem. Everything up to that point is prescribed, and nothing after.
C.A.C. Yes, quite so! We have no divine authority to do anything else before we break bread, not to carry on a little service before it, which has been done. The Lord has expressed His mind: This do for the calling of Me to mind. It is not an open matter, if our affections are right, we shall carry out His mind.
Rem. Sometimes we try to work up to it as an object.
C.A.C. In christendom they have what they call 'the Lord's supper' at the end of the service. That is not the divine thought, it is at the *beginning* (@Acts 20: 7)!
With this remembrance in view, I wish we might have this before us, that the Lord's thought is that it is for the calling of *Him* to mind (not a state of heart exactly, but a state of mind), which has a unifying effect. I wish we could pray about it and consider it.
{96}
THE LORD'S SUPPER
@1 Corinthians 11: 17 - 34
It is evident that the truth of the Lord's supper was brought out correctively in @1 Corinthians 11, the Lord's death having ceased to hold the hearts of the saints as gathered together. So that there was a disunited state of things and the saints were not unified; there was not a collective calling of the Lord to mind. Now it is in the absence of the Lord that He is to be called to mind, and this is necessarily as the One who had passed through death. The assembly knows Him thus. The whole truth of His devotion to the assembly has come out, and the whole truth of God's relations to His people on earth. For one aspect of the assembly is that those who compose it are set in blessing of new covenant character. They are born anew and cleansed morally by the knowledge of God, and their sins and lawlessnesses are remembered no more. But they have come to this great blessing as brought into the value of the blood of the Lord Jesus. The houses of Israel and Judah have not come into new covenant blessing yet, but the saints of the assembly have; they are in it as a people on earth. His death has brought it about, and the memorials speak of His death, but they are partaken of for the calling of Him to mind. But the One we call to mind is known to us as living. We should not be together in assembly at all if we did not know that He was living at the right hand of God and had thus received the promise of the Holy Spirit and poured out the Spirit on His own down here.
The "me" that is called to mind is the absent One now in heaven, or gone to the Father, but known now as He could not be known in the days of His flesh. His love and what He is for the assembly has been expressed in death but He lives in all the strength of it. He is called to mind as the perpetuation of that love, though absent and risen.
{97}
The assembly is not to think of Him collectively in any smaller measure of love than was set forth in His death, and it can never think of Him in a greater measure, but the love that is thought of is a present love, a living love. He says, as it were, 'The love expressed in My death was Myself and it is living in Me now'. He will never express that love in the same way again but it will never be less than it was then. The "me" is unchanged. It is not one Person in death and another as with the Father; the "me" is the permanent Lover of the assembly.
But His death is employed in the Supper because the assembly begins at that point, and also because of the deep moral exercises which are bound up with the Lord's body and His blood. It is the public announcement of His death until He come. It is a great reality! The Lord has died here. If what we do is the setting forth of that, how can we do it unworthily? It must be done in deepest reverence, with subdued hearts, as in presence of the fact that the Lord, the righteous One, died here. If one does not regard the emblems with reverence, one is guilty in respect of the body and the blood of the Lord. They are that symbolically and representatively. There is no change in the elements, but they have been consecrated by the Lord to represent His body and His blood, so that they are not ordinary bread and wine to be treated merely as such. The Lord's words have consecrated them, and he who disregards them becomes guilty.
"But let a man prove himself" (verse 28). Are the bread and the cup really to me symbolically the body and the blood of the Lord? Do they really mean that to me? Then I am welcome to eat and to drink. But if I do not distinguish His body I am trifling with a holy institution and I shall come under judgment. They were not distinguishing the body at Corinth. The Lord's supper had become just like a common meal, and the Lord was dealing with them on account of this.
{98}
In the act of eating and drinking the assembly announces the Lord's death. The act has a public voice; it does not speak of His life in flesh, or of His risen life, it speaks of His death. Then it must be done worthily. This refers to the manner of doing it, not to the worthiness of the persons who do it. It refers to what can be seen. If one did it unworthily he would certainly have no part in calling the Lord to mind; he does not regard the bread and the cup as representing the body and blood of the Lord, but they do in the Lord's account. They have that place in the assembly; the assembly gives them that place. So that to eat and drink carelessly is a most serious matter; it makes one guilty in respect of the body and blood of the Lord. Therefore a man is to prove himself as to whether the bread and the cup really represent to him the body and the blood of the Lord.
It is not examining his own spiritual state, or reviewing his own history, that is meant by this; it is not even a question of seeing whether I have judged everything that I ought to have judged. These things are all necessary in their place but they are not what the apostle has in mind here.
Do the loaf and the cup really represent to me the body and blood of the Lord? If they do, there would be no doubt about my partaking worthily. But if one does not distinguish the body, one eats and drinks judgment to oneself. That is, it is essential to separate that bread from all other bread, to see the unique place the Lord has given it as representing His body. It comes before us on every occasion invested with the special and holy character given to it by the Lord's own words.
{99}
THE SUPPER
@1 Corinthians 11: 17 - 34
The twelve apostles were with the Lord when He instituted His supper. It was given to men who had a place in the assembly as representing the Lord's authority. They were to do a certain act in remembrance of Him, and this was of such importance to Him that He gave an account of the institution to Paul from heaven so that Paul might deliver it to the assemblies in the gentile world. The Lord was to be remembered, or called to mind, in a certain definite act which required that the saints should come together. There are five references to coming together in these verses, and Paul clearly implies that their coming together should have been to eat the Lord's supper, for he has to tell them that they were not eating that Supper. Each was eating his *own* supper, and there were divisions among them even when they came together, so that they came together not for the better but for the worse. Truly eating the Lord's supper would abolish all divisions among saints, and would bring about perfect unity in mind. We are not told in 1 Corinthians *when* the Supper was to be eaten, but we have an example in @Acts 20 of certain brethren, of whom Paul was one, who spent a whole week in Troas, and there is nothing said about them assembling to break bread until the first day of the week: this intimates to us that that is the special day for assembling together.
The proper object to be before us in coming together in assembly is to eat the Lord's supper, and it is for the remembrance of Him, or calling Him to mind. If the Lord were here we should have no reason to call Him to mind. It is because He is not here that the assembly calls Him to mind in a collective way. No doubt there was a custom amongst the Jews to break bread for one who had died and to drink a cup of consolation (@Jeremiah 16: 7), and the Lord took
{100}
this up and glorified it by giving it a place in relation to Himself. But He gave it quite a new and different setting.
The breaking of bread amongst the Jews was in "mourning", the cup was one of "consolations" for a parent of whom they had been bereaved. We do not break bread for the Lord in this sense at all: our breaking of bread is a service of thanksgiving, it is a eucharist, there is no mournful element in it. It is not that we have lost Him, but that we have gained Him in the most blessed way: His body has been given, His blood poured out for us. He now has a body of glory in heaven, but He once had a body which He devoted to the will of God and for us, and He once had a life which could be poured out that the new covenant might take effect. And it is ours to give thanks, even as He did when He instituted His supper. We call Him to mind as giving thanks for the loaf and the cup: the Lord was in Spirit beyond His suffering and death when He gave thanks. All was, to His mind, accomplished, His body given and His blood poured out, so that nothing remained but thanksgiving. That is, the Lord placed Himself anticipatively in the position in which His own would be when they ate His supper, and He would be called to mind as in that position. It was in the night in which He was delivered up: the hour of crisis had come, but in His own mind and spirit He could, in the company of His apostles, regard His body as given and His blood as poured out. The new covenant as brought in in the power of His blood was present to Him in that cup. We are to do what He did, for the calling of Him to mind, and we are also to eat the bread and drink the cup, which He did not do. That is our part, to call Him to mind, and our drinking the cup has its place in this. So that the whole service, from the giving of thanks for the bread to the drinking of the cup, is with the object of calling Him to mind, not quite as He was here in the days of His flesh, for His sufferings and death were all future then, but viewed as having given His body and as having
{101}
made good the new covenant in His blood. So that it is Christ as He is now who is called to mind. He is not viewed as present, but as called to mind, for the saints of the assembly are in the place where He died, but they call Him to mind as the One who in instituting the Supper regarded His body as given, and His blood as filling the cup with new covenant blessings. It is not Christ after the flesh that we call to mind, but Christ as having given His body for the saints of the assembly and as having secured in His blood the new covenant.
What a beautiful thought this gives us of the assembly as all brought together into one thought of Christ! The whole company calls Him to mind in the reality of His great service of love so that every mind is filled with Him as He is now in the presence of God, having devoted His body and His blood for the assembly! Now if a company on earth is thus filled in mind with Him, what is to hinder His coming to them? We do not read of His coming to any company of saints after His ascension because this is not a public matter. It belongs to the intimacies of holy affection, but the disciple whom Jesus loved has recorded His precious words, "I am coming to you". It is for love to be on the alert, to be ready to say, "The voice of my beloved! Behold, he cometh Leaping upon the mountains, Skipping upon the hills. My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart" (@Song of Songs 2: 8, 9). He is making haste to come to those who call Him to mind. He is able to come in a spiritual way to us if we are ready to receive Him in the truth of His present love to the assembly. The Holy Spirit is here, who is also the Spirit of the Lord, the Spirit of the glorious Man who is at the right hand of God, so that if He is attracted to come to us He can come in an unseen but very real way to His lovers here as collectively calling Him to mind. He does not come in body, as we well know, but He comes in a spiritual way, so that He can be thus known in a thousand different assemblies at the same time. But when He comes we no
{102}
longer call Him to mind: He is there Himself, discerned as present by His lovers who worship Him. Some may ask, How, and in what character, will He manifest Himself? That we cannot tell beforehand.
{103}
CALLING HIM TO MIND
@1 Corinthians 11: 23 - 26
The yearly sacrifices called sins to mind, but the Lord's supper calls Him to mind. When He instituted it He was going to be absent from His own, but He provided that they should do collectively what would call Him to mind in a very special and distinctive way. He would be called to mind as having given His body for the saints of the assembly and as having His blood poured out. His life in flesh has terminated in a wondrous way of love, for it has been given up for His own, and even those who had known Him according to flesh would know Him thus no longer. His disciples, in breaking bread, called Him to mind in an entirely different way from how they had known Him "in the days of his flesh". They called Him to mind as having passed by death out of that condition, and as disclosing His love to them in doing so, but as living in relation to them in the preciousness of that love though absent from the world. If we call Him to mind, it is as He is now, absent from the world, but known in the love in which He gave Himself.
But then we call Him to mind as having made Himself in death and blood-shedding available for us: He says "for you" in regard of both His body and His blood. He looks at His own now as those for whom He has given His body. Whatever they might have been before, His body is for them, and they are to take this in and understand it. All connected with the first and imperfect order is taken away, and the second is established, and not a trace remains of any liability which we might have incurred as Jews under law or as lawless Gentiles. The cup is the new covenant in the power of the blood of Christ, and it is impossible to alter that covenant, or to diminish the value of the blood in the power of which it stands. Christ effected all this when here, and what He effected remains, and the assembly now
{104}
calls Him to mind as the absent One whose love effected it all, but who is now in a most blessed relationship of love to the assembly, though absent. The emblems represent the body and blood of the Lord: He used His body and His blood to give expression to His love, but His love has achieved Its purpose, and the assembly calls Him to mind as living for her in all the reality of His present love.
The wondrous thing now is that we can be risen with Him, through faith of the working of God who raised Him from among the dead. The full weight of our death was upon Him: it has passed from us altogether that we might be raised with Him. Not only are we cleared from the past, but we are introduced into what is wholly new in association with One who has been raised. What pains His love took to assure them that the night of death had passed, and that there was a morning without clouds, and that He was the Light of that morning! His active grace would draw them over the abyss of death, where He had been for them, to Himself.
{105}
SUMMARY OF A READING @1 CORINTHIANS 12: 1 - 31
The assembly is looked at as the place where God is working; all the Persons of the Godhead are concerned. The Spirit gives the gift but the Lord directs the action. Everything that is of God in the assembly gives the impression of Jesus as Lord. The one who takes part gives the impression that he is really subject to the Lord. There is what is spiritually natural. What marks a man is what he prays about in secret. God draws out the heart in a certain direction. It is not that a man *thinks* about it but it is spiritually natural. Here it is the spreading abroad of what is given; what is good for me is equally good for all saints; that is in the way of christian life and blessing. Ephesians goes much wider than this; it takes in all saints everywhere.
We want to know more of what it is to drink of one Spirit, the Spirit of Christ; that is how unity is arrived at practically. Instruction will not bring it about, nothing but drinking of the Spirit of Christ. It is something you drink here, the Holy Spirit looked at in a particular way. Everything that was suitable to God came out in the Lord Jesus. What a wonderful thing! It is only as the life of Christ comes out in the saints that there is unity. All this was brought out to exercise the Corinthians, and it ought to exercise us. Are we acting in that way -- like Christ? Is the Spirit of Christ coming out in us?
{106}
SUMMARY OF A READING @1 CORINTHIANS 12: 1 - 31
One Spirit, the great object of all is to bring out Christ. It is very encouraging that in each there is a little bit to be worked out. If I fail in my bit, in so far the testimony fails. There is a loss to you and to other members. It is a greater thing to be a member of the body than a gift. The gifts are set in the *assembly*, not in the *body*, but for the edifying of the body. The gifts are working for the time when they reach 'that favoured hour when toil shall all be o'er'. Gifts will cease then; there will be no more need of gift. Divine light and divine warmth are in the body. God might take up a man and use him as a gift but it is a greater thing to be a member of the body. If we get the thought that we are in the body of Christ, it would awaken the desire to express Christ. The exercises of each one ought to be that I am a part, and a necessary part, of the body of Christ. We think that if we go on well as individuals that is all that is required, but there is more, we must show love. Drinking into one Spirit (verse 13); really the Spirit of Christ is love. There is a want of the practical working out of Christ in the saints; we are not looking out for Christ in the saints and that is the cause of a great deal of dissatisfaction; we look at the imperfections. We have to recognise the assembly according to God and in that way to bring in light and power and grace. You see how the apostles kept the mind of God before them. Paul spoke of the whole twelve tribes when they could not be seen or found; faith stuck to the original intention of God; God has set His testimony amongst His people and I think faith sticks to it. David says, "I have stuck (Darby Translation is 'cleave') unto thy testimonies" (@Psalm 119: 31, Authorised Version). It is a fine word.
A good deal of right conduct fails in its object because it is not done in a right spirit. If discipline is done in a hard,
{107}
legal kind of way it fails of its object because love is not in it.
If a member suffer (verse 26) he is incapacitated to fulfil his proper function. Each member is supposed to contribute, and if he ceases to contribute he is a drag upon the others. What the apostle is working for all through is the vitality of the body, and the vitality of the body is love. Each one has a particular place and he should set to work to find out what that place is. If saints were exercised as to their place in the body each would very easily find and fill his right place, not by introspection but by exercise. If a person is going on simply and happily he would naturally be in his place and be a contributor. The apostle is here viewing the working of the assembly as come together.
{108}
FROM C.A.C.S NOTES @1 CORINTHIANS 12: 1 - 31
The body is the organism down here in which the various members function as the Spirit has sovereignly assigned to them their place. The assembly is composed of the same persons but viewed collectively rather than corporately. It is a company of persons found in many different places but having the character everywhere of God's assembly. The Spirit divides to each member of the body as He pleases, and God has set certain gifts in the assembly. These gifts are sovereignly conferred and yet they are the subject of desire, so that it is open to us to pray that we may have gifts. The greater gifts are to be earnestly desired as being for the greatest profit of the assembly. But after all, a gift distinguishes a person, it makes him different from his brethren, and this might work wrongly if gift were not clothed with the divine nature. If there is a part of the body which lacks honour, it becomes our privilege to clothe it with all the thoughts of divine love which will much more than compensate for any seeming lack of honour in the divine ordering. But then on the other hand, the comely and prominent member needs to be reminded that without love he has nothing and is nothing. The gifts are all to be accompanied by love. It is love that gives stature. We may have spiritual gifts and yet be children in stature.
There was much gift at Corinth -- they came behind in no gift -- but there was a lack of the binding, wrapping power of love. The real power of ministry is love marking the vessel of gift. In chapter 12 it is seen that the Spirit distributes the gifts and that they all work in harmony as members of one body. But the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, is God operating here not only in power but in love. That is, He is operating according to His own end. The Lord's supper has shown how divine love is operating, and
{109}
the Spirit has come in as a result of that operating. The Spirit has now a vessel here in which His movements come out. But they are all movements in love because they are for the expression of God. "God is indeed amongst you" (chapter 14: 25). The body is for spiritual manifestations, but they are given in love or God is not in them at all.
{110}
FROM C.A.C.S NOTES @1 CORINTHIANS 12: 1 - 31
Having given us the truth of headship in its bearing on order with regard to man and woman in their speaking to God or for God, and having given the Lord's institution of His supper as the rallying point of the assembly, the apostle takes up the subject of spiritual manifestations. He does not pursue the line of assembly worship towards the Lord or towards God: He makes no reference to the Lord taking His place in the midst of the assembly. I suppose the state of the Corinthians did not permit of any development on that line. The matter that was important to be considered next was the subject of spiritual manifestations as found in the assembly viewed as the one body here on earth. It is the body as the anointed vessel here, furnished with gifts for profit, all of which are operated by one and the same Spirit. This is a universal thought, which is made known to us that we may understand what has come to pass in the wisdom and power of God. It extends far beyond Corinth, for it took in at that time all saints on earth who had come under the baptism of the one Spirit. This delivers us at once from any thought of independency, for how can any member of one body be independent of the other members? They must all work together in unity, and this applies particularly to the gifts, services and operations that go on in the body. He does not go into the deeper and more spiritual aspects of the truth of the one body as seen in Colossians and Ephesians where the body is for the display of the graces of the heavenly Man. Here it is the gifts and services and operations that are profitable to the saints. A divine wealth has been conferred which results in a great variety of contribution, all having its source in one Spirit, and therefore all operating in perfect unity. This was something quite different from anything they had known in the world.
{111}
They had been "led away to dumb idols, in whatever way ye might be led" (verse 2). It seems to indicate that they had been under a leading of an evil kind, and they had now to learn to recognise the Spirit of God. And this would be, in the first place, by observing how speakers referred to Jesus. If one said "Curse on Jesus", he was certainly not speaking in the power of the Spirit of God. This shows that there were those who pretended to have spiritual gifts, but they were really Satan's ministers. Satan's ministers would be known by casting some slight on Jesus -- something that would take away His true glory as the blessed expression of God in Man. This evidently took at Corinth a bold form. Satan had made such inroads, and got such a footing there, that there were speakers actually going so far as to say "Curse on Jesus". The low state into which the Corinthians had dropped may be gathered from this, and, of course, it is a warning to us; see also @1 John 4.
But on the other hand "no one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit". I would much like help on this scripture. It can hardly mean that whenever the literal words, Lord Jesus, are used, as they might be by an unconverted man, they are evidence of the power of the Holy Spirit. Is it not rather intended to indicate to us that the first evidence of the power of the Holy Spirit is the personal recognition by the one who speaks of the lordship of Jesus? The Holy Spirit would keep that in the forefront and no one can really give the Lord Jesus His place and due honour except in the power of the Holy Spirit. The test of the power of the Holy Spirit is the recognition of the lordship of Jesus. Let no one think that he can speak in the power of the Holy Spirit unless his whole heart bows down to the Lord as the supreme One. This conditions all the spiritual manifestations.
All the gifts are in the power of the same Spirit, so they are unified, and they all function to bring the body into evidence. Every manifestation of the Spirit brings out that
{112}
the Spirit is here, but acting by means of gifts for the profit of saints as composing the body. There is continual evidence that the Spirit is here, but manifested in distinctive ways, of which nine are specified, which would cover in principle all spiritual manifestations. The gifts can never be in discord because they are all in the power of one Spirit, and they can never be the subject of partiality or preference, so as to be set against one another, for they are all beautifully blended and co-ordinated like the members of the human body. The body is looked at in this chapter as made up of members, each of whom has a distinctive fitness for the manifestation of the Spirit. It is seen as a practical and substantial reality.
The actual services are under the administration of "the same Lord". The Lord is the Director in all service: the servants do not look to the Holy Spirit for direction or support, but to the Lord. So personal nearness to the Lord is required for every act of service. The gift is capacity for service, but individual reference to the Lord is needed by each servant, or he may miss his way or lose his time or perhaps get in the way of other servants.
Then there are divine operations going on all the time. The Spirit gives ability to serve, the Lord directs in service, but alongside all this, God is operating. The question for all who serve is, can God operate by means of what we do? He operates all things in all -- we rejoice in that, we look out for it. The assembly is a wonderful body, the only body on earth in which God is operating in a spiritual way.
The manifestation of the Spirit is always for profit. It is that side of things which is brought before us in 1 Corinthians, not the Spirit leading Godward but having the profit of the saints in view. The Christ is the anointed body down here in which every member contributes to the well-being of the whole, according to the Spirit's sovereignty. It strikes me that all the things mentioned here are things in which sisters may have part as well as brothers. The
{113}
ministerial gifts are mentioned at the end of the chapter and graded according to their importance. But spiritual manifestations are not limited to brothers or to the assembly as convened. The point in this chapter is that all the saints have been baptised in the power of one Spirit into one body, and have all been given to drink of one Spirit. Such a thing was never known before -- how near it brings God to men. There is baptism into one body; this is effected in the very place where we were Jews or Gentiles, bond or free. In entering into what the Spirit has effected we are conscious of great nearness to each other. You have your spirit and I have mine naturally, but now alongside my spirit and your spirit is something much greater, and that is the one Spirit who has baptised us into one body: all organically one in the power of the one Spirit. "And have all been given to drink of one Spirit". Being baptised is being made to share in the promised effusion of the Holy Spirit. It is a universal thing and applies to all who now stand in the value of redemption. But being given to drink is what we do each for himself, so that all souls have the same inward satisfaction and joy. It is not simply that we are constituted one body but we all have the same kind of inward satisfaction.

Baptism is always, I believe, in Scripture a bringing on to entirely new ground. John's baptism was to repentance: his was "the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins" (@Luke 3: 3). But after the Lord's ascension, His disciples were baptised with the Holy Spirit (@Acts 1: 5), but all so baptised were Jews. Peter said this extended to the Gentiles (@Acts 11: 16). But Paul as having the light of the body -- his own peculiar ministry -- shows that Jews or Greeks, bond or free, have all in the power of one Spirit been baptised into one body. All thus now baptised in one Spirit are brought to this new ground, they are brought to be one body. However distinctive their gifts, they are one body. The distinctive gifts as operated by the one and the same Spirit are compared to the different members of the human body: they all work together as one body, they can never be detached or independent, because all are in the power of one Spirit. As a member of the body I cannot isolate or individualise myself: I am a member of an anointed body, an entirely new position here in this world; I am a constituent part of a vital organism in which the operations of the Spirit are active. My business is to function in that organism in which I am placed by the baptism of the one Spirit. I am a member of the body and I have to recognise that I am one of many, and to learn how to function in my appointed place so that I promote the well-being of the body.
The human body is the most wonderful organism of which we have any knowledge. Man was not only created and made, but he was "formed" under the direct touch of God's hand. It is, as we might say, an artistic conception. There is an expression in the Song of Songs applied to the prince's daughter: "The work of the hands of an artist"
{115}
(chapter 7: 1). Man, as to his body, was indeed this; he was "fearfully, wonderfully made", "curiously wrought", and all his members were written in God's book "when as yet there was none of them" (@Psalm 139: 14 - 16). The members of the human body were the subject of divine counsel, and were written in God's book before they were formed by His hand out of the dust of the ground. Dust was the material out of which they were made, but the design was in God's book before they were formed. He worked in divine skill to form what He had planned long before, and as He formed the body of Adam we may be sure that He had in mind that one body which would in due time be the result of the baptising of the Spirit. In that body there is the most perfect balance and proportion. It cannot be improved upon; each member is necessary and is in its place; no one member can take the place of another. The foot may be foolish enough to say, "Because I am not a hand I am not of the body"; so is God having in mind that certain members would be discontented with the place assigned to them and might cease to function bodywise because they thought some other member had a more favoured place? But it is of God that there should be different members, and the Spirit has made no mistake in the place and function which He has given to each. Each is needed, and God on His own behalf has set each of the members in the body as it has pleased Him. The body is the great result, the sum total; no one member is independent of any other member.
But then another truth comes out, that certain members of the body seem to be weaker; but they are necessary! And certain parts we esteem to be less honourable, but these we clothe with more abundant honour -- a striking and significant suggestion, for it is suggested that clothing implies honour. It seems to me that the clothing as applied to the less honourable members would be put on the saints by the ministry of what is eternal or that which is perfect. The gifts which characterise the members are time gifts; not
{116}
one of those mentioned in the early verses of chapter 12 go into eternity. Now I may be less honourable in the distribution of the time gifts, and it is they which are chiefly in view in this chapter, but this does not hinder me from being honoured in a greater and permanent way. God has tempered the body together: that is the natural human body, and it has entered into His design that certain parts of the body should be adorned by clothing. This thought, as we know, runs through Scripture, and this chapter shows that it has some application to Christ's body. The less honourable saints are, in regard to the time gifts, the more important does it become that they should be governed by love, which never fails. Love will preserve us from any division in the body: it would seem that the members have the same care every one for another. The way of surpassing excellence is like the adornment which make beautiful even the least honourable members in the body here. Spiritual manifestations are subordinate to love. So that if I feel I am less honourable than others in the line of spiritual manifestations, I must lay myself out to excel on the line of love.
If one member suffer (that is, a member out of function for the moment) all suffer with it. If a member is glorified (that is, a member through whom there is a manifestation of the Spirit) all the members rejoice with it.
Now while all this refers to the human body it is, of course, intended to have its application to Christ's body. So the apostle concludes the subject by saying, "Now ye are Christ's body, and members in particular". The one Spirit coming into manifestation in the saints in Corinth, and in every locality, so one is exercised to be a member in whom and by whom spiritual operations go on. It is easy to see that this would practically exclude the flesh and the natural mind of man and would really prepare us for chapter 13.

I would suggest the importance of recognising that the local assembly is the assembly of God; it is the place where the word of God is known and where God dwells and walks. He dwells there so that He may be known, and He walks there: there are movements of God in the assembly which can be discerned by those who have eyes to see.
Then the assembly is also the body of Christ. It is the anointed vessel in which manifestations of the Spirit are found. And if we look at these manifestations in chapter 12, we see that they refer to a furnishing which brings into evidence what is profitable. Everything necessary is provided just as in the human body. The word of wisdom, the word of knowledge, faith, gifts of healing, miracles, prophecy, discerning of spirits, tongues, interpretation. Nine members, as we may say, provided for functioning in unity, so that each one is complementary to the others. No one is sufficient without the others. This is a death-blow to the clerical system. All the saints have been baptised into one body, to function together in unity, all given to drink of one Spirit. It is important to see that here he does not touch on prayer or praise or worship. It is all what relates to what is profitable for the saints. It is supposed, I think, that all the men take part in prayer or praise. These are not matters sovereignly distributed by the Spirit; they pertain to believing men, as such.
All this comes out in each local assembly. All are necessary to the local functioning, bringing out that the Spirit of God has distributed spiritual qualifications so as to secure the profit of all, and each being necessary. It will be seen that it is not the ministry of the word in chapter 12 alone, but many other furnishings. Prophecy would be as one thing amongst many. At the end of the chapter certain
{118}
distinctive gifts are said to be set in the assembly, and amongst them ministerial gifts have the first place. These are outstanding contributions to the welfare of the assembly.
This all shows how the assembly is furnished, so that we come to chapter 14 with an assurance that adequate supplies are available. God dwells there, and the assembly is the Christ, and there are spiritual qualifications. But chapter 14 shows that the saints come together in any locality to be edified. The whole chapter supposes that we come together assemblywise for the ministry of the word. It is all through a question of the assembly, and the whole assembly comes together in one place. It would be apparent, I think, that the Lord had in mind that a power for ministry to edification would be found in every locality where His name was called upon. It is evident that Paul expected to find such gatherings of the saints if he came.
He expected that he might speak to the assembly "five words". All through, it is "in the assembly".
It will be noticed that a wide scope of ministry is in view. Prophecy is expressly said to be marked by edification, encouragement and consolation. Then the apostle speaks of a wider range of ministry in verse 6: revelation, knowledge, prophecy, teaching. Then instruction in verse 19; learning and being encouraged in verse 31.
It is manifest that a great variety of ministry is contemplated, and as a matter of individual exercise. Each is to be exercised to prophecy; that is, it is not to be ordinary talking, but a speaking that will make manifest that God is amongst His saints in assembly. God would help in this, it is His own ordering.
The readings do not afford room for this. We limit ourselves to one book generally. It is most important that we should consider all Scripture together, if possible, but it is quite a different thing to be found desiring earnestly the greater gifts and being emulous of spiritual manifestations.
{119}
I have no doubt we shall have to accept our measure in each locality; we cannot go beyond the measure of spirituality that is there. But the very exercise of such assemblings would promote and deepen spirituality. Many a brother would be transformed if he took up the exercise. I think there is enough available in the way of vessels. All that is wanted is love. The saints ought to be able to rely on the fact that no brother will attempt to speak without a definite exercise before God.
The word "assembly", or "assemblies", appears nine times in chapter 14. In prophecy there is a moral force which affects even an unbeliever, showing that it is not merely saying what is correct.
Coming together to eat the Lord's supper is evidently preparatory to worship, to the direct service of God. The Lord remembered, the will of God, the love of God, the Lord coming to His own, leading to God and the Father. We are not thinking of edification then but the spiritual service of God. We worship by the Spirit of God; "the Father seeks such" (@John 4: 23).
{120}
SUMMARY OF A READING @1 CORINTHIANS 13: 1 - 13; @1 CORINTHIANS 14: 1 - 40
It is good for us to be going on with that which abides to eternity. Things in the assembly come to an end but the Spirit abides. Love is the spirit of everything. The love of God will be the moving spring of everything in a coming day. At the present time the great exercise of love is to edify, it is for building up. Seeing all is in part, all are necessary the one to the other. You have a part that I have not. Every individual saint has had a ray of light direct from heaven, an impression of Christ. The impression of Christ we have will come out in the city. What makes a saint such a wonderful person is that he has received something from Christ. God did not intend that every saint should be cast in the same mould. Each member in the body has a particular place in the body and we can rejoice in the thought. The impression of Christ that any saint has is very edifying, for we are able to pass on the knowledge of God that we have and it is edifying. We do not sufficiently cherish that ray of light that has reached us. We ought to cherish it and follow it up. Prophesying is really bringing the light of God to bear upon souls in a practical way -- it is speaking the oracles of God. It is a kind of thing that entirely sets aside the mind of man.
Love would be always thinking of the good of others. In the assembly we should be soberly considering the good of others. The contrast is made here between the one who edifies himself and the one who edifies the assembly (verse 4). In a man's own room he may be beside himself but in the assembly he is to be sober. Our knowledge of divine things is very small and imperfect (chapter 13: 12); practically we are very small and feeble in our apprehension of things. I dare say all this was brought in to show the Corinthians that they did not know. The Corinthians were taken up with the
{121}
shell of things, but in chapter 13 you get the kernel. God has appointed each one to a certain place, and no one can fill another's place. We know very imperfectly now.
There are three things that go together in chapter 14: 3, and these three things go together in everything in the assembly of God; however high and holy the things are that are set before us, there is encouragement and there is consolation, so that when you are edified you are also encouraged and comforted. God encourages us in what is of Himself; He is the God of all encouragement. The apostle presses understanding very much here; we ought to exercise ourselves to understand what we hear; it was not only the spirit but the understanding. If people's understanding is unfruitful they do not get anything. *He* has the first word of blessing, but He has the last word too, and we come between. Verse 19 is instruction. We come together really to be instructed. He instructs us in the knowledge of God and in the meaning of His own death. "One is your instructor, and all *ye* are brethren" (@Matthew 23: 8). That gives as good an idea of the assembly as any scripture that I know. The great thing is that the assembly is God's place and what is there is of God, so that if an unbeliever come in, evil would be manifested. Everything in the assembly would savour of God and therefore be blessed and attractive to the believer. There is no appeal to sentiment or feelings in any way, the effect is conviction. Then there is certain order laid down here which is very important. God considers the capacity of saints (verse 29). You cannot receive more than a certain amount. Deference to the Spirit in others would lead to peace (verse 30). The women should be exercised about what they hear. If they do not understand let them ask some godly brother afterwards (verses 34, 35). We have to take the principle of the thing. It is a mark of spirituality where a man recognises all this as the commandment of the Lord (verse 37).
{122}
FROM C.A.C.S NOTES @1 CORINTHIANS 14: 1 - 40
We saw in chapter 12 that the one body is formed by all the members being baptised into it in the power of one Spirit. It is not looked at as a defective thing but as an organism complete in all its parts, like the human body, all the members being in proportion and balance and co-ordinated by the wisdom and power of God. The Christ as the anointed body does not contemplate any working of flesh. It is characterised throughout by spiritual manifestations and operations. Now if this is to be worked out practically it is clear that it can only be in the divine nature. So chapter 13 comes in to show us that love is the life of the body. And this is not the 'invisible church', as people say, it is a body composed of men and women in Corinth, and many other places, all being vehicles for the manifestation of the Spirit and for the activities of love.
There is nothing about the saints coming together in chapters 12 and 13, but chapter 14 contemplates the assembly as together and spiritual manifestations going on there. So that the manifestations in this chapter are limited to men -- the women are to be silent. The men are to be emulous of spiritual manifestations. Chapter 13 tells us that we are not to be emulous of others; love would never want to take the place which another has. We would rather like to see him shine in all the spiritual worth which God has given him. But we are all to be emulous of spiritual manifestations.
All the men should desire to pray in the assembly and to prophesy. This is the normal exercise of every believing man. Those who take part in the meetings have to gain through this exercise. Then it comes out that he is ready to make a selection with regard to what we desire. The apostle says, "Rather that ye should prophesy". They had the gift of tongues at Corinth, and we may gather from this chapter that
{123}
tongues were too much in evidence. There was something miraculous about a tongue, but if it does not edify, it serves no useful purpose in the assembly. It is evident that a man with a gift of tongues could use it and think it was a gift altogether in the power of the Holy Spirit; and yet if there was no interpreter it was not edifying.
Edification builds up in the knowledge of God, and encouragement comes in in face of difficulties, and consolation is for those in sorrow. It shows what children they were that they seem to have preferred tongues to what edified. But Paul speaks of four ways in which he might speak of prophecy.
Revelation would be a manifestation from God by inspiration, which would be something imparted which had been acquired from exercise, or it may be from others. Prophecy would be a word from God to meet present conditions in the assembly. Teaching would be the opening up of the truth in the ability which God had given. The apostle speaks lower down in the chapter of instruction, and this is an important matter. How much instruction saints need is only known to those who come in contact with them. Further in the chapter he speaks of saints having a psalm, a teaching, a tongue, a revelation, an interpretation. All this shows how varied are the forms of edification in the assembly; and all this shows the importance of what we call the meetings for ministry, because it gives much greater scope than is usually found in the assembly as conveyed by the Spirit. Ministry then must be suitable to the service of the assembly Godward or towards the Lord. The aspect ever is towards divine Persons, but the aspect in chapter 14 is manward. In the reading of the Scriptures every form of edifying ministry comes before us.
The Spirit of God knew that tongues would cease historically in the assembly, so this chapter was written to comfort us by letting us see that the greater gifts remain. We ought to abound for the edification of the assembly.

FROM C.A.C.S NOTES @1 CORINTHIANS 15: 1 - 58
The first man Adam became a living soul: he lived by divine in-breathing; no other creature became a living soul in the same wonderful way, and all human beings bear his image: he was made of dust, and so are we, for we are of him. We cannot naturally rise above the head from which we sprang, but it is made known to us in the glad tidings that there is another Adam. God has brought in One who has a place corresponding with the place Adam was set in; that is, He is Head to give life spiritually to all those who are quickened by Him. This is a spiritual matter because He is "a quickening spirit": I think it should be a capital "S" here. There will never be another such, it is impossible that there should be another: He is the last Adam. Divine thoughts reach finality in the last Adam; so that we may well fix our attention upon Him and He quickens, or makes alive, a spiritual race who are constituted heavenly ones by being quickened by Him. Quickening is always, I believe, in the New Testament, out of death. The first man Adam brought us all into death, but the last Adam quickens in the power of His own risen life out of death. This was illustrated in His breathing into His disciples on the resurrection day (@John 20: 22); it was to make them realise that they lived now in the power of His risen life. This life is in the Holy Spirit received from Him, His own Spirit as the risen Man, as we read elsewhere, "The Spirit of life in Christ Jesus". The disciples had not had it before, but they knew Him as the last Adam, the quickening Spirit, then. They had been of the natural before -- we see it often -- but now they were vitally in what was spiritual and beyond death. It was an actuality in Him risen and ascending to His Father, but it was spiritually real to them as having His Spirit breathed in.
{125}
This leads on to the thought of the second Man who completely supersedes the first, and His distinguishing feature is that He is out of heaven. He is of a heavenly order, the heavenly One, and those quickened by Him are heavenly ones. He does not quicken for earth but for heaven. He was Himself put to death in flesh but made alive in (the) Spirit, as Peter tells us. Quickening has to do with what lies before it, and that is what is heavenly now in a spiritual sense, or what is heavenly actually when the Lord comes. The heavenly One here (verses 48, 49) is what Christ is as in heaven: He is the heavenly One even in bodily condition. His body is called "his body of glory" (@Philippians 3: 21). He was the second Man out of heaven in all His moral characteristics when here, but it was not until He was glorified that He was seen as the One whose image we shall bear.
The second Man out of heaven is not quite the same thought as the heavenly One. The former applies to Him as having His origin in heaven so that He was always when here of the things which are above. Indeed, He was the Son of man who is in heaven even when here, He was from above in contrast to being of the earth. But when He is spoken of as the heavenly One it refers to what He is now as in heaven, and this makes it surpassingly wonderful that His saints are said to be heavenly ones "such as the heavenly one". We do not understand our calling until we see that we are as much heavenly ones as Christ is the heavenly One. This is a matter of God's calling, and of God's appointment in this time of heavenly things. We cannot make this a time of earthly things because God has fixed that it is a time of heavenly things. All saints now are partakers of the heavenly calling: they inherit God's kingdom on the heavenly side of it, therefore flesh and blood cannot inherit it. There must be a changed condition, and believers get it by resurrection or by a change which is equivalent to resurrection at the last trumpet. Corruption
{126}
cannot inherit incorruptibility: it must needs put on incorruptibility. Corruptibility refers to those living; they will put on an incorruptible condition of body suitable to the heavenly side of the kingdom. So far as they are concerned, death will be swallowed up in victory. The question is asked of death, Where is thy sting? thy victory? The sting of death is sin, that is the sharp venomous sting which death carries. It is the terrible fact that sin brought it in that strikes terror to the conscience of man. Then the power of sin is the law -- a statement to be deeply considered: the law which tells man what he ought to be and to do is the very power of sin: the prohibitions intensified the desire for what is wrong. What man in his ignorance would look to for help against sin is a thing which adds to the power of sin in his conscience. The more clearly he sees what he ought to be, the more powerful is his conviction of sin.
{127}
SUMMARY OF A READING @1 CORINTHIANS 15: 1 - 58
The apostle seems to have reserved to the last the most serious thing at Corinth, the denial of the resurrection. The other things were inconsistent with the truth but this was the sweeping away of the truth altogether. Everything was gone if Christ was not risen; the whole thing was a lie that had been preached to them from beginning to end. The idea of the enemy is to limit everything to the earth and the present time. This was the error of the Sadducees come in -- rationalism. The error of the Pharisees was a religious error. What the devil had brought in from the beginning resulted in death on man and so now he would bring in the denial of the resurrection. Nothing could put away sin but death, and nothing could remove death but resurrection. Paul had received this gospel from the glory; he had it direct from Christ in heaven and what he had received was that Christ had died for sins and that He had been buried, etc. If instead of reasoning out things we bring Christ in we should be put right at once. The simple might not be able to explain things but if he has the unction he has the sense that he is right. God is allowing His people to be tested today by the most pernicious errors. The Old Testament saints died in the consciousness that God would not be baffled. This chapter shows that God is really victorious and will be. We are not very familiar with resurrection power ourselves. The point is really to be in the consciousness of present victory. The enemy has succeeded in putting away the truth of resurrection. Resurrection puts us outside the course of things here altogether. Where Christ is carries the whole position of where His own are -- all that belongs to Him. Where Christ is is the important thing and settles the whole matter if I love Him. I think the common idea is that death is somewhere between God and us; you go through death,
{128}
and there at the other side is God; but there is no longer the distance of death between us and God. Someone has said that Bunyan put the river in the wrong place; he ought to have had it near where the burden rolled off instead of at the end of the journey. We can be with God outside death altogether and that because Christ has died and risen. J.B.S. said, speaking of his departure not long before, that his thought of it was that he should be very happy with the Lord and all at once he would find himself with Him. It is really in the company of a living One that we taste life; it is as being in the company of the Lord that we are happy. There must be a transaction between the soul and Christ; it is not simply that it is something you hear and believe. To these individuals it was a distinct manifestation. What Paul could say was that Christ had possession of him. As to the things of christianity we are often like children looking into the shop windows and desiring to have, and stop there. If God gives us desires, He wants them to be satisfied. I think the actual journey to resurrection is a great reality to us. There is the attraction of Christ and there is the death side to learn too. The discipline of God comes in to help us, and there are the yearnings of life. This is a death scene. God presents everything that is beautiful and attractive to us. I am sure if we paid more attention to God we should get on better. He tells us most blessed things if we would only listen to Him. If Israel had hearkened to the word it would have been their salvation.

NOTES OF A READING @1 CORINTHIANS 15: 1 - 58
Ques. Will you say why the great subject of resurrection follows as it does on the truth of the body and the subject of ministry and so forth, as we get in the previous chapter?
C.A.C. I suppose the apostle with the spirit of wisdom left the most serious matter to the end of his letter. If there is no resurrection there is nothing! It sweeps away the whole fabric of christianity at once. It is well to keep in mind what we have often noticed in the epistle, that the object of the apostle was to produce spirituality in these children of his at Corinth. They had received the gospel, but were very unspiritual. They were gratifying the flesh in many different ways, so he brings forward one thing after another to bring about more spiritual conditions -- a matter which all Christians should carefully consider -- and there is nothing that would produce spirituality more than resurrection.
Rem. The Spirit was given consequent on Christ being risen and ascended.
C.A.C. It is important perhaps to notice the subject is confined to believers in this chapter. It is not a general teaching on the resurrection; the wicked dead are not once mentioned, unbelievers do not come into it. We know they will be raised to the resurrection of judgment. There is no allusion to that; it is the resurrection of Christ as bearing on believers.
Rem. The gospel is brought in here.
C.A.C. He now has to go back to what he had brought before them at the beginning, and repeat it again to them.
Ques. What is the great bearing of resurrection in this chapter? It does not go beyond the earth.
C.A.C. Well, he goes a little beyond the earth when speaking of the heavenly One, but in its general bearing it
{130}
refers to the earth.
Ques. Is it the truth of resurrection here, as established in Him?
C.A.C. The first thing is to believe the testimony that has been rendered. God has set forth a testimony by accredited witnesses; they are all men that can be trusted -- because that is the point here in the different appearings of the Lord -- so that no mention is made of the women among those that saw the Lord in resurrection. They are not required in this chapter. This is a question of the testimony by accredited witnesses and Paul himself tells us that he received the gospel; he got it directly from Christ in heaven. It is wonderful that he should be instructed in the great truth that Christ died for our sins. The Lord told him that from heaven.
Ques. Were the Corinthians actually unbelieving in the fact of the resurrection or is there something more in the apostle's mind?
C.A.C. Certain persons amongst them were saying that there was no resurrection of dead persons. Paul meets it by bringing in Christ. That is the usual way of meeting all difficulties; how all difficulties melt away when He is brought in. If dead people do not rise, then Christ is not risen; all Paul said is false, and their faith not worth a straw, because they have believed a lie. He shows the bearing of His resurrection in regard of all those who are His. "The first-fruits, Christ; then those that are the Christ's at his coming" (verse 23). God has brought about the resurrection of a dead Man, and the value and the result of it are for all those that belong to that Man, and it does not extend any further than that. He says, 'You have received what we told you, and stand in it, and are saved'.
The men who denied the resurrection were Satan's emissaries, and not believers at all. And it had a certain effect, it worked like a poison.
Rem. It brings out a wonderful line of truth.
{131}
C.A.C. So that he turns everything to blessing.
Rem. "According to the scriptures" (verse 3), it says.
C.A.C. Yes, it could all be established from the Old Testament. There is a good deal there about Christ dying for His people's sin, and a good deal about His being raised. It could be proved from Scripture.
Rem. @Isaiah 53 speaks of His burial.
C.A.C. You could not have resurrection without burial, could you? That is, the whole sentence that had been passed on man as a fallen creature was really executed upon Christ. If people do not understand Christ's burial they will be worldly. Many are glad Christ has died for them, as securing them a place in heaven, but what about His burial? It is emphasised in Scripture that we are to be buried with Him. Burial is always connected with baptism. "Buried therefore with him by baptism unto death" (@Romans 6: 4). In baptism the person goes out of sight, so the baptism of Christ is the most serious matter to consider.
Ques. Would you say that condition has disappeared forever?
C.A.C. He will never be seen again in the condition He was in before He died. There was no necessity on His part for burial, but He had come there in the cause of those who were under death and the sentence, "Unto dust shalt thou return" (@Genesis 3: 19). But it does not end there.
Rem. "Handle me and see, for a spirit has not flesh and bones as ye see me having" (@Luke 24: 39). That showed them He was in a new condition in resurrection. It was a first step to spirituality for the disciples.
C.A.C. Yes. It is important to see that Christ has risen in a spiritual body, not a body in flesh and blood. It was a body that could go through a closed door. You may say, How can you explain that? You cannot explain spiritual matters to the natural mind. He could come out of the grave without disturbing the gravestone; the graveclothes were undisturbed too, and the very position of the graveclothes
{132}
was a testimony to resurrection, for it says, they "saw and believed" (@John 20: S), and that was the witness.
We are going to have spiritual bodies too. If I am going to be wholly spiritual in five minutes, I had better be as spiritual as I can now! We may be in spiritual bodies, wholly like Him, without a trace of the world or the flesh about us in five minutes, so we had better be spiritual now.
What He has done is accredited to us; the sins of the believer are absolutely gone. God could not find them. And death has gone, if Christ has died for us. Death does not remain for us as the judgment of God or as the power of Satan; it is absolutely annulled, as if it did not exist.
Ques. What does the flesh mean?
C.A.C. It refers in one sense to our bodily condition, but connected with the bodily condition there is terrible fleshly condition. We have to learn to judge our will, and we look forward to the time when we shall say goodbye to it for ever. In our glorified bodies there will not be a trace of it.
Rem. "In that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God" (@Galatians 2: 20). There is a new influence altogether.
C.A.C. There is a new power, the old shop is opened under a new management. Paul says, "I have persecuted the assembly of God" (verse 9). He is quite conscious he is the same man who did it, though he would not do it now. "By God's grace I am what I am" (verse 10).
Ques. Could we not all say that in a certain sense?
C.A.C. I am not sure we could say much about it. I sometimes feel there is much about me that the grace of God did not make me!
It is rather striking that we have no account of these appearings in the gospels, not one of them is mentioned. He is setting the thing out in public testimony. All these were selected witnesses, accredited men, and they have given a testimony that no one can gainsay. There were, nearly thirty
{133}
years after the resurrection, more than two hundred and fifty persons who had seen Christ with their living eyes. There never was a more established testimony in the history of the world.
Rem. It says, "He appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve".
C.A.C. It is very beautiful to see it was the twelve; that is, what they were in their testimonial witness. In the Lord's mind they were "the twelve". That is God's way of reckoning very often. Paul says, "To which our whole twelve tribes ... hope to arrive" (@Acts 26: 7). Well, Paul, where are they? He could not have shown them.
The resurrection has no part in the history of the world. No unbeliever saw the resurrection of the Lord; it is the peculiar property of the believer. People say, I believe in the resurrection, but they do not.
Rem. Paul places a tremendous amount of importance on the place the glad tidings have.
C.A.C. The gospel is preached to find out people who are interested. If we had never heard of the resurrection, the first time we did we should be profoundly astonished; but we have got accustomed to it. If it does not lay hold of the soul, what is the use of it? It is only a creed to one.
It is wonderful to learn that my sins have been taken away by a perfect, holy Substitute who bore them for me -- that He has gone under for me the sentence of death. "Unto dust shalt thou return", of which I deserved to be the subject, for I deserved to be swept off the face of the earth -- so that I might be able to think of resurrection with joy. No unbeliever can think of resurrection with joy. He knows he is accountable. But the believer can contemplate resurrection with the deepest joy, and know we are entitled to come into all that is connected with resurrection -- to share His part and place, beyond death in resurrection. After His having been in death, think what it was to God to have Him out of it! "Raised up from among the dead by the
{134}
glory of the Father" (@Romans 6: 4) -- the glory of the Father wrapped itself around Him in Joseph's tomb and brought Him out!
Rem. "And has raised us up together" (@Ephesians 2: 6); that is, we are clear for the presentation.
C.A.C. Yes, is it not wonderful?
He is going to come forth in a very short time with all His saints with Him, in His great glory, in this very world as it is now to put down all that is contrary to God, so that righteousness and peace will fill the earth. It is quite possible that hundreds of millions of people will live to see this. For men to be talking about a better world with the Bible in their hand is wicked unbelief; it is flying in the face of the testimony of Scripture.
Ques. "If ye hold fast ..." (verse 2), why is that there?
C.A.C. Of course if people give up the gospel there is nothing else for them.
Ques. "Unless indeed ye have believed in vain" -- what does that mean?
C.A.C. Unless it was all false that I told you -- then it was no good believing it, was it?
Ques. What is the thought in regard to James and the apostles?
C.A.C. I suppose James was brought in as one who had every opportunity to believe in the lifetime of the Lord, and he did not believe, and the Lord appeared to him in resurrection and converted him on the spot. He lived in the same house with him, and did not believe on Him! It says so, "neither did his brethren believe on him" (@John 7: 5). It represents, no doubt, a testimony, that there is such a man. All he had seen of Christ after the flesh for thirty years did not convert him; one sight of Him risen converted him. No doubt he represents those that will not believe on Him until they see Him, His brethren in a future day. So James is brought in as an accredited witness, he is amongst that class.
{135}
The point is, there is a volume of testimony that cannot be discredited.
Rem. James speaks well in @Acts 15: 13.
C.A.C. He never quite shook off his Judaism; there were certain legal characteristics about him, but he could not have given a more definite answer as to the resurrection.
Paul says, "Thus we preach, and thus ye have believed"; so there is no sense in people saying there is not a resurrection. If it is not true, then all we said was nothing, and your faith was nothing, and we have been found false witnesses; that is, he puts it in the very plainest way. It is a question of faith, a divine testimony is only received by faith. He does not mind confessing that, if it is not true, "we are the most miserable of all men" (verse 19).
{136}
SUMMARY OF A READING @1 CORINTHIANS 15: 15 - 45
The apostle would not have had much to say if he had not brought in the resurrection in his preaching. It is important for one to have his feet planted on the rock of resurrection. This was a special attack of the enemy and not the state of the Corinthians that made him write like this. There was an activity of mind at Corinth that laid them open to questions and carnal reasonings. The important thing is that resurrection is the sphere of God's working at the present time. In @Psalm 150: 1 there are two things: "Praise God in his sanctuary; praise him in the firmament of his power". 1 Corinthians is the firmament of His power, and 2 Corinthians is the sanctuary. The first epistle (resurrection) is all the power of God. 1 Corinthians is the foundation epistle and 2 Corinthians is the superstructure. Where Christ is determines everything for God and for faith. If Christ was accepted here and honoured after the flesh, this would be the place for God. The resurrection sphere is the sphere where God is working, and there is no knowledge of God anywhere else. He is the God who raised up Jesus from the dead. Abraham knew Him as the God of resurrection; it is very wonderful.
The enemy has brought in sins, and in that way death has ruined the old creation, and God has a new creation. I think the aim of the enemy is to try and make it out that God is in relation to this scene of evil. Faith knowing God cannot possibly connect God with the present state of things, so Enoch walked with God, and death could not touch him. Enoch is the first example of eternal life in Scripture. God would not let two men die (Enoch and Elijah), showing that He was superior to death and He could make a man superior to death. Now we see the Lord Jesus Christ superior to death. God shows us a scene that never can be
{137}
shadowed by death, and He shows us the Person who fills it. God must have His way and He must have everything according to His thought and purpose. Satan has apparently had his way for a long time. Christ is the first-fruits; you see in a risen Man everything that is according to God, and that Man is put in power to subdue everything to Himself, and when He has subjugated everything He will hand over the kingdom to God. I think it is at the end of the millennium that all will be seen to be dealt with, everything that challenges God's place of supremacy -- sin, death, antichrist, the beast, Satan. God's Man is holy and true.
I suppose that death is the last power to be dealt with (verse 26); all these other powers will be dealt with first, and last of all death. There will be no more death; there could not possibly be death in a scene where God is all in all. The whole scene will be pervaded by life, and all will be suited to God. The wicked dead are not contemplated in this chapter. "In the Christ all shall be made alive", but it is in *Christ*. The wicked are not in Christ. Those in Christ will be made alive after the image of Christ, but the wicked will not be in the image of Christ. It is God's harvest; He is going to have a harvest out of this wicked scene. The whole chapter shows there is going to be a harvest for God; Christ the first, and nothing could be in Christ that is not of Christ.
There are three very important prepositions: *through, of, in*. Through the administration of grace the believer is *of* Christ, and being *of* Christ he is *in* Christ. Everything is *through* Christ, as in @Romans 5: "peace towards God *through* our Lord Jesus Christ", "making our boast in God, *through* our Lord Jesus Christ", etc. What is through Christ can be preached to all men. The moment I receive the gift of Christ I am of Christ, and being of Him I am in Him. It is wonderful how God has gone to work to build up Christ in our souls. In thinking of reigning we think of authority, but the great thing is influence. The influence of the king is greater than authority. The king's influence gives character
{138}
to the country over which he rules. Christ gives His character to everything for God. He will exercise His authority against the rebels but His influence will be exercised over His own. The One who exercises the rule is the Holy One and True. It is all exercised to bring about a sphere where God is all in all.
Everything is subjugated to man and man is subject to God (verse 27). Christ will cease to be King but He will never cease to be Head. He gives up the kingdom but He never gives up the headship, and our relation with Him is as Head. Israel is in relation to Christ in an order of things that will pass away but the church is in relation to Him in an order of things that will never pass away. We are glad to be relieved, but after all we ought to be a little interested in what God is doing. I must have a risen Christ for righteousness, but I do not think there is any affection until we are delivered from our own side. You must be free -- love must be free. It is a blessed thing to see that all our relations with God are outside everything connected with this scene, and that puts us in view of all that for which God is working, that resurrection scene. We want to be a little more in the spirit of it now.
{139}
NOTES OF A READING @1 CORINTHIANS 15: 20 - 28
C.A.C. The apostle reasons in the first part of the chapter on the importance of Christ's resurrection, and he shows that if Christ was not risen, all he had preached to them was nothing, and they had gained nothing by believing it. But if Christ had been raised, it was the proof that dead persons could be raised. If one man was raised, it was the proof that dead persons could be raised. It is most wonderful that Christ has been found among the dead; and He has been found there that He might be the first-fruits in resurrection.
Ques. Is it just as wonderful that the Lord should be in death, as be raised? If He goes into death, it emphasises all connected with that death.
C.A.C. Nothing could be more wonderful than the thought of a divine Person, One who was God, coming into a condition in which He could die. So Christ, the apostle said, was the first to show light to the people and to the nations (@Acts 26:23). By His resurrection Christ has become the great Illuminator of the world -- the Illuminator of the Gentiles.
We see all men going down into death. We do not need the Bible to know death has passed upon all men, we can see it. And the light that is worth having is the light of resurrection.
Rem. That is, not the doctrine, but the substance, for all is substantiated in Christ. They were "preaching by Jesus the resurrection from among the dead" (@Acts 4: 2), it says.
C.A.C. And He was the first, Paul says, by the resurrection of the dead to show light to the people and the nations.
Ques. Why are the nine verses a parenthesis?
{140}
C.A.C. Well, do they not come in as a very special revelation from God? Paul brings them in in the midst of his argument (he leaves it for the moment but returns to it in verse 29), and turns aside to this great revelation -- this great shining of divine light.
"How say some among you that there is not a resurrection of those that are dead?" (verse 12). He exposes the folly of their thoughts. There are plenty saying that today, it is not a thing that has died out.
Rem. Satan suggests that everything to be gone in for is now, this side of death, and the argument is, there is nothing after death. But when a man sees there is something after death, his outlook is altered entirely.
C.A.C. And how it magnifies Christ; because there is only one Man beyond death, after having been in it, as raised from among the dead. He is the only One in that position, so the light of all that is after death shines in that Man.
And the resurrection of those that are dead has come to light in Christ. It is "by man came death". People have extraordinary ideas about death, calling it the debt of nature. They do not like to think they brought death upon themselves. It is man that brought in death, and now Man has brought in resurrection. It is Adam and Christ put in contrast. It is the man -- Adam -- who brought in death, not Satan. My father brought in death, our father brought it in, our parents brought in death. How could any of his race bring in resurrection? That is the question! If one of his race could have done so, it would have been a great triumph -- if there had been one who could reverse death and bring in resurrection. Well, where could such a man be found?
This chapter has a reference to those who are Christ's; it is not a chapter that any unconverted person would have any interest in. We see a Person raised from among the dead, and if I look at Christ I see death absolutely annulled.
{141}
If I look at myself, I do not.
Ques. Why is the word "annulled" used?
C.A.C. Annulled is about the strongest word that could be used to show it is completely set aside, annulled of its power. Christ was in death in a more terrible and complete way than any other ever was. Now He is risen out of it, death is annulled, and sin is annulled, and Satan is annulled. It is in looking at Christ you see that.
Ques. How do we see death annulled, for we see it around us?
C.A.C. By looking at Christ; that is the only way to see death annulled. I see a glorified, risen Man coming out of the dark domain of death -- coming out in victorious power.
Ques. It is not non-existent?
C.A.C. It is in the faith of our souls that we reach it; we have the faith of a blessed Man raised from among the dead, and everything hangs upon that. His death would be nothing, if He had not been raised. His resurrection is the proof of the power and efficacy of His death.
Ques. Why is it "the Christ" here?
C.A.C. He is God's anointed Man to destroy the power of death and the power of the devil completely and put away the sins of His people; and believers thankfully accept it, and they fix their eyes in faith on Christ risen from the dead. So that in the resurrection sphere Christ is everything; you cannot have any doubt about that. He fills that sphere, and He is going to have a great harvest. "The first-fruits, Christ; then those that are the Christ's at his coming" (verse 23). He is the First-fruits of a mighty harvest.
Rem. There is nothing of self in resurrection, nothing but Christ, and we need to get our eyes on Him.
Rem. It is remarkable that we are saved by His life; we are not told that we are saved by His death.
C.A.C. Yes, it has helped me to see that what God has done for Christ (the blessed anointed Man) He can do for
{142}
me; and that is brought out here in the first-fruits.
Ques. And God is going to secure a universe, where He is going to be supreme. Why is it the Adam and the Christ -- the article is used here?
C.A.C. To show the distinctiveness of the two heads. "In the Adam all die". We were all naturally in the Adam -- of that family of which he was head. But "in the Christ all shall be made alive"; that is, it is a transfer to a new Head, and that is what faith really is. I am transferred in the faith of my soul from Adam to Christ. We finish with the conviction that all expectation from Adam ends in death, and we pass into connection with a new Head, and all connected with Him will be made alive in His life. It is not that all men are made alive in Christ, but "in Christ" all are made alive. You must come into connection with the new Head, or there is nothing but death. And all those alive in resurrection will be seen to be in Christ. We could not quite say so of the Old Testament saints, for He had not come.
Ques. Is that @Romans 5: 12?
C.A.C. Yes, the thing is worked out there very fully. It is good to see that in the resurrection state there will only be those in Christ. When Christ comes, the Old Testament saints will be raised and translated with the New Testament saints. They will then be manifestly alive in Christ. What a triumph for God that will be -- myriads of Old Testament and New Testament and tribulation saints, all made alive in Christ. All will be "the Christ's" (verse 23), from the beginning up to that moment.
Rem. God has only one way for every man -- those before waited.
C.A.C. Now there is the privilege available for men, that they can leave Adam and come to Christ. Christ died for all that they might have that opportunity, and that is really conversion; it means I leave myself altogether behind, and possess Christ. So that one can say, Christ is my life. I have no other life but Christ, so that the great
{143}
thing is to get more acquainted with Christ risen. Christ is our life, and it says, "When the Christ is manifested .. then shall *ye* also be manifested with him in glory" (@Colossians 3: 4); I have nothing else of life but Christ, all else is death before God. J.B.S. often asked, Have you changed your man? We are not really converted until this takes place.
Ques. Then we have a clearer understanding of what the death of Christ means?
C.A.C. Why did He die for me? It was because nothing attached to me but sins and death, and He took it all up, that He might be my life. It is very simple. We pass over from ourselves and the world to Christ, and from that moment we never think of anything else in the faith of our souls but Christ.
Men in the world are just working out Adam; and looking at it morally, it is nothing but death. What is the working out of it now but bloodshed and strife, and what is that but death? When Christ comes in, it will be the very opposite, as we read in this very scripture. Man's place, and what is due to man, is death.
Then he passes over in verse 24 to "the end". That is, he passes over the thousand years millennial reign of Christ. He says that those who are the Christ's shall be raised at His coming (that refers to before His coming) and he passes right over to the end, and looks at the reign of Christ as putting down everything that is contrary to God. "When he shall have annulled all rule and all authority and power. For he must reign until he put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that is annulled is death" (verses 24 - 26). That is, the reign of Christ is a time of the subjugation of all rule and authority and power contrary to God. It will be then dealt with by Christ. He will reign until everything contrary to God will be put down.
Rem. Death is spoken of as the "last enemy" (verse 26). The state will not exist even.
C.A.C. Yes.
{144}
Rem. Death is looked at as a spoiler, it robs man and it robs God.
Ques. It goes on to Christ giving up the kingdom to "him who is God and Father". Why is the name of Father brought in?
C.A.C. It is now an eternal name of God. He is Father as well as God. It is the name of revelation, the name the Son has revealed Him as now; He is not so known in the Old Testament. God retains its character; He is not going to lay aside that character. Every family in heaven and earth is named of the Father. The Father it is who has impressed certain features of Christ on all families of the redeemed. Some will have blessing in heaven, and some on earth, even in eternity.
The Son will exercise the kingdom for a thousand years, and then He will give up the kingdom to Him who is God and Father, because there is nothing more to be done on kingdom lines, all will be subjugated. So He will give it up to God and the Father, having accomplished all. God will always be God, and always the Father, and the Son always the Son throughout eternity. So the remarkable statement comes in, that the Son is placed in subjection to God, and all the saints will be along with Him in that place of subjection. It is the way that God will be all in all, because everything in God's blessed universe will come under the headship of One placed in subjection. There will be no element of lawlessness then. True blessedness is to be in subjection to God. The Son has the first place in that glorious scene of subjection. It is the peculiar, distinctive and eternal glory of the Son. It has been expressed, as it were, beforehand in the life of Jesus; He was in perfect subjection. And repentance is that I judge my lawless and insubject self, and I pass over in my affections to the One who was always subject. And then the Spirit is given. In that eternal scene there will be the Spirit; there will be nothing seen in the subject One but God, and there will be
{145}
nothing seen in those in companionship in subjection with that One, but God. And that will be a blissful eternity. Insubjection is what causes all the discontent and annoyance and irritability of the believer; it is simply the rising up in ourselves of the awful corrupt nature of the flesh. But there is that in the new man that loves to be subject to His will.
<blockquote>'God's will is sweetest to him <br>When it triumphs at his cost'. </blockquote>
I am afraid we do not always think so.
{146}
SUMMARY OF A READING @1 CORINTHIANS 15: 20 - 58
Resurrection is the firmament of God's power. Had they known God they must have had the sense that resurrection was a moral necessity. Death was an enemy, and God would not suffer any enemy to triumph. Death comes in as the destruction of man, the creature of God, and God was not going to accept quietly the destruction of His creature, so resurrection has to come in as recovery with a view to the whole universe of bliss. As all the damage has come in by man, resurrection has come in by Man. It was God's intention from the first that He should be set forth in man. Another Man has come in in whom there is the perfect setting forth of God. Really God has brought in a Man in whom resurrection is inherent, One who is the resurrection Himself, not merely one whom God raised. It is brought out here that not only in Christ all shall be made alive, but that that Man by whom resurrection comes is also the Son, a Person of the Godhead. Resurrection is inherent in His Person. He could say, "In three days I will raise it up". "He spoke of the temple of his body" (@John 2: 19, 21). The Christ is also the Son, He is a Person in the Godhead. Though having all the power, He never used it except as in subjection. The Son has taken the place of subjection to the Father, and resurrection is in His power, even the raising of the wicked dead. "All who are in the tombs shall hear his voice, and shall go forth" (@John 5: 28, 29). He was of such intrinsic worth. There was nothing that death could touch morally in that Man, He was beyond the touch of death, the Prince of life. "Thou wilt not ... allow thy Holy One to see corruption" (@Psalm 16: 10). It is a holy scene, it is all characterised by holiness. What marks the new creation is holiness, and therefore it is incorruptible. By the grace of God the Lord took part in death; He was made to feel the
{147}
power of the enemy in death -- of course as to His own personal state there was nothing death could touch. Death is a moral necessity to us. In @Psalm 22 there was not only the forsaking of God but there were the strong bulls of Bashan, and He felt it as no other could, but He was really in the path of resurrection. He was going on to resurrection. There was everything about Christ to make Him the Head and Centre of God's universe.
In verse 24 "the end" is not the finality but the great end of all the ways of God. It is what He does Himself in verse 28. It is part of His perfection, it is His glory to be in that place of subjection. God will be all; He is the only Object of His creatures, but that is only brought about by His being in all. Certain things have a place in the universe that are not at all according to God's nature -- principalities, powers, etc.
And these have all to be put down and removed so that everything in the universe should be according to God. What marks the new creation is love, and what preserves it is holiness: the divine energy of love carrying everything according to God and holiness preserving from everything evil. Sin has come into the universe of God and through eternity there will be the witness of evil. Love is the active power of holiness now. Holiness supposes the knowledge of good and evil. In an innocent world there was no such thing as holiness. You could not have holiness where there was no idea or conception of evil.
Death is the last enemy to be annulled in the historical order of things. Satan will be dealt with before the last resurrection; in the ways of God those who have been the cause of all the mishap will be dealt with first. The issue is that "God may be all in all". And every enemy has to be cleared away that God may have what His heart is set upon.
{148}
SUMMARY OF A READING @1 CORINTHIANS 15: 29 - 45
In those days if a man was baptised he was a target for the enemy. The apostle had had anything but an easy time of it; he had fought with beasts at Ephesus. He shows them that it was folly to become a Christian if there was no resurrection. I think certain unbelievers had come in amongst them and they had corrupted the saints (verse 33).
The notion that people have of resurrection is that they will be raised up to live pretty much as they do now, whereas resurrection introduces an entirely new order, and that is what gives it a practical bearing at the present time.
Every believer now is a child of resurrection, begotten again by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead; it is the very starting-point. Everything depends upon where Christ is; Christ after the flesh exists no more, He has died.
The Christ that we know is a risen Christ, and every blessing is in Him and through Him. The wonderful thing is that the Christian is walking about indwelt with the Spirit of a risen Man. The whole work of God in the soul is to direct us to Christ risen. The practical end is that the saints may represent Christ here because they are connected with a new Head. God has two great ways: there is the privilege line and there is the experimental line. We have to learn death and the breaking up of things here, and then there is what He manifests of Christ to us. I do not think we should value the privilege line if we did not have the experimental line, but it is the mind of God that we should learn on the privilege line. The apostle could say, "Daily I die". I find I am very much in danger of living here rather than dying here. Christ as Priest comes to our side that He may take us to His side. It is very important to see that Christ has His assembly here. The assembly is the place of attraction for us. The assembly is altogether on resurrection and heavenly
{149}
ground. From verse 35 onward is the bringing out of the new order.
The figure of sowing (verse 37) shows that it is not the body that shall be, but a *bare grain*; there is a connection between what goes down and what comes up. The point is that what is put down is not what comes up. What is sown in dishonour and weakness goes down, but what comes up is in glory and power. The present condition is not suitable to the resurrection scene. There is a positive connection between what goes down and what comes up -- as to the dead there is nothing there but corruption; you laid down that body of corruption, and corruption cannot inherit incorruptibility. If we begin to reason and question we shall be sure to err; we must not go outside the statements of Scripture. A man of another order was before the mind of God before sin came in. The saints shall be raised according to the order of the last Adam, a life-giving spirit. There are different orders in creation, one the glory of the sun, another the glory of the moon, and another the glory of the stars (verse 41). The apostle was seeking to lead the saints to another order. The great thing is to keep clear that we are heavenly ones, we are of the order of the heavenly ones. The saint as being a heavenly one has a mortal body here, and Christ has to be expressed in that mortal body; that is a wonderful distinction! It is more wonderful in a certain way that Christ should come out in a mortal body than that He should come out in a glorified body. God's original thought was to have a heavenly man, and He has in Christ. Everything must correspond, and a mortal body does not correspond with a heavenly man.
{150}
NOTES OF A READING @1 CORINTHIANS 15: 29 - 50
C.A.C. I suppose most of the wrong thoughts which Christians have entertained are the result of contact with unspiritual persons. These doubts as to the resurrection no doubt came into circulation through the tares which the devil had sown in the field. So that the apostle has to warn the saints that "evil communications corrupt good manners" (verse 33). I suppose it is more than ever necessary we should keep ourselves very strictly from contact with what is evil, and persons who are infected with evil. And generally what Satan is working at is something that lies at the very foundation of all revealed truth. Satan does not trouble about details. It will be seen that every wrong thought strikes at the very root of all that God has made known.
Ques. Speaking of foundation truths, would verse 29 be an example of the danger of our not abiding by our baptism?
C.A.C. It was very foolish for people to step into the christian ranks, if those who had died had nothing. A number of persons had been standing in the christian profession, in the faith of resurrection, and a good many of them had died, had fallen asleep, but others were ready to come forward and stand in their places. Well, it was a mad thing if there was no resurrection.
Rem. Baptism here has the force of committal, has it not? I believe men are baptised into the Turkish army in that way.
C.A.C. He is showing the extreme folly of the thought. If there was no resurrection, all that went on among Christians was folly; and there was nothing better than to eat and drink and be merry, if tomorrow we die; that is, have a good time of it now.
Rem. In Timothy, Paul speaks of some who said the
{151}
resurrection was past already, and overthrew the faith of some.
C.A.C. You would have thought it was not possible to say such a thing. And I have met with people who say they have their resurrection bodies now. I said to one who spoke to me like that, 'Well, it is a very shabby turn-out'!
Ques. Is it an incentive to take up baptism; you would not take it up otherwise?
C.A.C. Of course not! Being baptised in those days meant you might be thrown to the beasts tomorrow at Ephesus. Well, what folly.
Ques. What does it mean, "I have fought with beasts in Ephesus"?
C.A.C. Paul was constantly facing danger; every day he did not know whether he would be killed. It was the character of his life. No one would enter on a path like that except in the faith of resurrection, it would be folly. And of course we are not unaware that many people are puzzled about resurrection, and asking just what we get here, "How are the dead raised? and with what body do they come?" Well, Paul had a very short answer, we might say.
Ques. What connection is there between verse 34, "Awake up righteously", and what goes before? Does it suggest that there were those who believed, but who had not come to the knowledge of the power of God?
C.A.C. Yes, they were not awake morally. That is why he says, "Awake up righteously" -- they had not a right thought of anything.
Rem. I wondered if it was brought in as a sort of correction. The knowledge of God, and of His power and nature, would do away with these doubts.
C.A.C. Yes. It is a question of what God has before Him for His saints. You cannot see in a seed sown any evidence of what will spring up. It is sown a bare grain, and God gives it a body as it pleases Him -- that is the great thought.
{152}
Ques. So that connects definitely with verse 34 in that way?
C.A.C. Yes, quite so.
Rem. It is a divine necessity that there should be this new body.
Rem. The apostle presses the importance of death here: "Fool; what thou sowest is not quickened unless it die" (verse 36), and "Daily I die" (verse 31).
C.A.C. He is showing that the thought of quickening is, 'out of death'; that is the thought of quickening in the New Testament. If the saints are quickened out of death, it is to have a body as it pleases God; that is, the same kind of body as the heavenly One. He speaks of many different kinds of glory, God having distributed glory; but what is in view is something that transcends all other glories.
Rem. I suppose it is really the idea of order; to bring before our minds that we should be like that One -- after His order.
C.A.C. It is most important to see that. In the wisdom of God there is great variety in His ways, different kinds of flesh and different kinds of heavenly glory, even in nature. God has assigned different kinds of glory even naturally.
Well, He is going to surpass all that in His dealings with the saints; and resurrection is in view of the purpose of God.
Rem. The body will be raised on account of the Spirit that dwells in it.
C.A.C. It says, "Shall quicken your mortal bodies also on account of his Spirit which dwells in you" (@Romans 8: 11).
Rem. They will have a distinct place as of the assembly.
C.A.C. And of the heavenly saints. What he is after in all this teaching is to develop spirituality in the saints.
There was a great lack of it at Corinth.
Ques. You mean, to understand their heavenly calling and place?
C.A.C. That is the thing, to see that truth, and what
{153}
God has in purpose. What is the object of resurrection, if God has not some wonderful thought in His mind for His saints? What does it mean? The saints are quickened in view of all that is in the purpose of God for them.
Rem. The saints are going to have bodies suitable to their environment, not for the earth.
C.A.C. No, God is working now in relation to what is heavenly, and however much we want to be earthly, we cannot be earthly, because God has fixed it, that we are going to be heavenly.
I think there is a present quickening referred to. Saints are not quickened in their bodies, but in their affections, because the glad tidings have brought to light another Adam. Until we see that, we get nowhere. The first Adam brought in sin and death, and God has brought in another Head, One never to be succeeded -- the last Adam, and He is a quickening Spirit.
Man became a living soul in a wonderful way -- by the inbreathing of God; that is, man made out of dust; and we have all been connected with that head naturally. It did not qualify man for heaven, so if Adam had never sinned and never died, he would never have gone to heaven.
Israel in the millennium will be in flesh and blood on the earth. Morally they will be raised up out of their national death to live on the earth. They will have the knowledge of Christ risen, but they will not be risen.
Those who suffer and die for righteousness sake, and anticipatively for Christ's sake, have their part on the heavenly side. Every saint that will be raised, will be raised in the condition of heavenly purpose. It is patterned, of course, by the Lord. He was raised; He was on the earth for forty days to give unquestionable proof. But the very first day He came out of the grave He said, "I ascend" (@John 20: 17). And the place of association with Him as ascended is open to all saints, if we love Him. It is affection that joins Him in that sphere.
{154}
Those in the millennium see them in the heavenly side of the kingdom; flesh and blood cannot inherit God's kingdom. It is the heavenly side of the kingdom, entered into by the saints as raised from the dead. Old Testament saints will, no doubt, be raised at the same time as the saints of the assembly. When they are raised from the dead they will be in Christ.
Rem. There were the saints who rose after the resurrection of Christ "and appeared unto many" (@Matthew 27: 52,53).
C.A.C. It is a very remarkable testimony that persons came out of their graves after the resurrection. Well, I do not think they went back to their graves. Lazarus was brought back to his natural life here, and the last thing said of him was that they were talking of killing him. That was more resuscitation, but it was a wonderful demonstration of the power of the Son of God, that He could bring a man out of death.
In verse 54 he has in mind the heavenly -- the kingdom of God on its heavenly side, which requires a new condition; flesh and blood cannot come into it. It all stands connected with the "last Adam", and the "second man" (verse 47). He is showing that resurrection is an established matter, involving a change of condition. So you cannot tell at all from what is sown what will be raised.
Rem. A new Head is introduced to bring all this to pass.
C.A.C. The disciples on the resurrection day were made to live by His inbreathing. They had never had that before. They had been with Him, but on the natural line; their thoughts had been natural thoughts, but after that they lived in virtue of His own Spirit, "Because I live ye also shall live" (@John 14: 19).
Ques. Why are the saints viewed as being sown? In the Lord's death it was the fruit that is stressed. There is a difference.
{155}
C.A.C. It speaks of all that is actually coming to fruition in the purpose of God. It has done so in Christ. In the last Adam there is the finality of every divine thought. We do well to consider Him. And He was the heavenly One, and we have been brought to know Him thus by divine grace. And the marvellous thing is, "Such as the heavenly one, such also the heavenly ones" (verse 48), which is a marvellous thought for us to take in.
We are all going to bear the image of the heavenly One; there is not to be a shade of difference of bodily condition between Christ and His saints. Those who have borne the image of the one out of dust are going to bear the image of the heavenly One. We do not understand our calling until we understand that. The apostle Paul and the one just converted stand on exactly the same platform as to that. It is not a question of capacity here, but condition.
Ques. All in a certain order are alike; is not that the point here?
C.A.C. The point here is, that we are all alike, we are all to bear the image of the heavenly One. It is the point he is stressing, and it is important to stand to that.
We stand in the value of the heavenly One, and we are as heavenly as He is, and that not because of ourselves, nor because of the work of God in us even. It is on account of the purpose and calling that has marked us out before the foundation of the world, that we are all going to be conformed to the image of His Son. It is most important to see that clearly. This is all connected with purpose; it has nothing to do with responsibility.
Rem. It is all for God's pleasure; He is going to do it for His pleasure.
C.A.C. Yes. What sort of eternal condition does it please God to give those quickened by the last Adam? They are all made to live in the power of life in Him; there is no thought of responsibility in that, it is a sovereign act. The saints are going to be in the heavenly side of the kingdom
{156}
in the power of that. How beautiful to think that every person in that display will be like Christ. Does not that surpass any thought that might bring in a difference on the line of responsibility? In God's eternal purpose He is going to have sons according to His thought. You cannot bring in degrees of capacity, or kingdom reward, into that. They fade into insignificance in the presence of something so vastly great.
J.N.D. suggested that the object of our being like Christ was that there would be nothing whatever to distract from Himself. All those quickened by Him live in His life; there is not a shade of difference between His life and theirs. He is the second Man out of heaven; all that is suitable to heaven has been shown out morally by Him, "the Son of man who is in heaven" (@John 3:13). When we speak of Him as the heavenly One, that does not apply to Him on earth. He is in heaven in a body of glory, and that condition God has purposed for "many sons" (@Hebrews 2: 10). We shall be in that condition.
{157}
NOTES OF A READING @1 CORINTHIANS 15: 46 - 50
Ques. The first man and the second man (verse 47); is it the persons or is it order?
C.A.C. I thought it was the persons, two individuals but the two heads; that is, the first man is the head of an order, and the second Man is the Head of an order. I think it is a mistake to speak of the first man as meaning man after the flesh. It is a common expression and people do not mean the first man; the first man was Adam. It would be more correct to say our old man; that is, if you can. It means that our man is somewhere in the rear. It pleased God that there should be a natural order and it pleased God that there should be a spiritual order. The natural man is one who is in relation to the whole system of created things. It was right that man should be in relation to created things, then if God brings in a spiritual race, the life of the spirit is all in relation with God. "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit" (@John 3: 6); it is, I suppose, of that kind in distinction from what is natural. It is very blessed to see this intention of God to connect man with heaven. The first man was out of the earth and could not be connected with what was of heaven; it was outside the order of his being altogether. God intended to have a Man suited to heaven as the first man was suited to the earth. I suppose Adam was the finest man that ever lived and perfectly suited to the earth. The heavenly is the idea of a man suited to God's own place. In the wisdom of the Spirit the truth of the new order is brought out for its moral bearing and not as a mere historical fact, so that we might understand the new order. The idea of Christ coming in to save a ruined creature is pretty generally accepted, but the truth is He gives His own life and character to everything so that everything should be after His order.
{158}
Ques. What is the difference between "heavenly" and "new creation"?
C.A.C. I think it is new creation because new creation is all after the order of Christ. I thought it was as having reached the heavenly state in resurrection that He takes the place of second Man. A great deal of what Christ wrought when here was in connection with the old order though seen much in view of resurrection, but after His resurrection everything was different. We never shall be like what He was, but we shall be like what He is. I was thinking in reference to Christ after the flesh, when He was here the predominant thought was the presentation of God to man; whereas when you come to resurrection the predominant thought is man in a new place with God. The great thing in connection with the incarnation is that *God* was manifest in flesh, and *God* was declared; but when you come to resurrection it is man in a new place with God. "I ascend ... to my God and your God" (@John 20: 17). In the gospels you get perfect illustrations of the gospel. We go back to the gospels and see it in the light of the cross and the glory, and we see a good deal in it that did not occur to people at the time. @John 13: 3 tells us He came out from God and went to God. He came out from God bringing the light of God to men, and then He goes to God that man might be entirely in a new place and order. It is a great thing to see what is before the face of God: there is a Man as perfectly suited to God as Adam was suited to earth. Christ is there before God representatively.
Ques. What do you mean by representatively?
C.A.C. Many have the idea of a Mediator as One being between a poor sinner and an angry God. The Mediator is between God and men but He has brought all the good of God to me, He has come to tell me that God is favourable to me. God is favourable to me and He has shown that in Christ; Christ came out to be the expression of the heart of God. And this chapter brings us to it that we
{159}
are to have the image of that heavenly One.
Rem. In @Romans 8: 34 it says He intercedes for us.
C.A.C. There He is Priest for me. God has been pleased that tribulation, distress, etc. should be taken up by a Man who knows what all that means and how to intercede for His own. As Man He intercedes, knowing what these things are as having felt the pressure of it all. All the cares and pressure do not take us out of the sense of His love. I think that the result of the intercession of Christ is that we are kept in the happy sense of the love of God. There is creature weakness in the presence of the enemy's power. He is rather showing how divine Persons are All for us: God is for us, Christ is for us, and the Spirit is for us.
{160}
HOW THE LORD WILL COME
@1 Corinthians 15: 51 - 54; @1 Thessalonians 4: 13 - 18
These scriptures should be studied prayerfully. They are so clear and explicit as to require no expounding.
Some of the believers at Thessalonica had died. The others were sorrowing because they were afraid that those who had died would miss the Lord's coming. Paul writes to comfort them by assuring them that the believers who had died would have part in it as much as those who were alive when He came. The spirits of all departed believers are with Christ, though their bodies are still here in the grave. When the Lord comes, the very first thing that will take place will be the raising of "the dead in Christ". That which was sown in weakness, dishonour and corruption will be raised in power and glory, and invested with the splendour of immortality. As it is said in @1 Corinthians 15: 42 - 44, "It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruptibility. It is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body". Then we who are *alive*, upon whom death has not laid its hand, we who have not descended to the grave, shall be changed and "caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we shall be always with the Lord".
That assembling shout may be heard today. Oh! what a soul-transporting thought it is, that in the twinkling of an eye we may be *caught up into glory* with the One who loves us and who gave Himself for us! The last message that has come down from the glorified Saviour is a thrice-repeated declaration, "Behold, I come quickly", "Behold, I come quickly", "Yea, I come quickly" (@Revelation 22: 7, 12, 20). Are we ready to look *up now*, and say with the beloved John, "Amen; come, Lord Jesus"?
We may now look at the *twofold character* of the Lord's
{161}
coming. Scripture plainly indicates that there are two events -- two acts, as it were -- in the Lord's coming, and if we confound these two events we shall come to wrong conclusions. We gather from Scripture that Christ will come firstly, *for His saints*, and secondly, *with His saints*. We have seen that the Lord Jesus is coming again to receive His own to Himself, that where He is they may be also. This is the true scriptural hope of the church. But the second event has a very prominent place in the Holy Scriptures, the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ in great power and glory to judge and reign over the earth. It is this event which is the grand theme of prophecy throughout Scripture. The great mistake which the Jews made, and in which, as a nation, they are still involved, was that they were so occupied with the scriptures which spoke of Christ coming in glory and power that they overlooked those which spoke of His humiliation and suffering. They lost sight of the fact that Christ was *coming in humiliation to suffer*, just as Christians now are in danger of losing sight of the fact that *He is coming in glory to reign*.
Yet all the prophets testify that the Lord is coming to judge the nations, and to rule the earth in righteousness. They speak largely of a time of future blessing for Israel and the whole world: a time when the knowledge of the Lord shall cover the earth as the waters cover the sea; a time when swords shall be forged into ploughshares, and the nations shall not learn war any more. How are all these things to come about?
At this point we must be warned against a common mistake. Many Christians fail to see the difference between Israel and the church, and they apply to the church Old Testament promises and prophecies which belong exclusively to Israel. The Old Testament is the record of God's past and future dealings with people on earth, and of those dealings Israel is the centre. In the Old Testament there is not a line about the church of God. The church is
{162}
composed of Jews and Gentiles, formed into one body, and united to Christ in glory by the Holy Spirit. It is thus a complete contrast to everything we read of before.
All the prophecies concerning Israel's future glory will yet be fulfilled. On account of idolatry and unbelief, and finally because of the rejection of Christ, Israel has been set aside for the present. But the day is coming when Israel will be brought from exile, and from wandering, to that promised land where the glory of God shall be her light, and the presence of the Lord her everlasting joy. See @Isaiah 11: 11 - 16; @Jeremiah 16: 14, 15; @Ezekiel 20: 40 - 44; @Isaiah 60; etc. The prophetic period of future happiness and peace on earth, commonly spoken of as the millennium, is always connected with the restoration of Judah and Israel to their own land.
This present period of grace in which we live is a gap in God's dealings with Israel. He has laid them aside "until the fulness of the nations be come in" (@Romans 11: 25). God is not now dealing with Israel as a nation: He is gathering out a bride for Christ -- the church -- from among both Jews and Gentiles. But when the church is complete and caught up to meet the Lord, God will resume His dealings with Israel. A number of Jews will be convicted of their sins, and will repent deeply of their individual and national wickedness. They will be brought to acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah, and they will look out for Him to come as their Deliverer and King. They will have to pass through the great tribulation spoken of in @Matthew 24, @Mark 13 and @Luke 21, and will look out for the signs which are there spoken of as preceding the coming of Christ in power and glory.
Many students of prophecy have not distinguished the two parts of the Lord's coming, and have supposed that these things are to happen before He comes for the church. It is an utter mistake for Christians to look *for signs*. Before this time of signs, wonders, earthquakes and tribulation
{163}
begins, the church will be caught up to meet the Lord in the air, and will be happy in His presence during the time of all these terrible disasters and calamities on earth. His own word to the church is, "Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee out of the hour of trial, which is about to come upon the whole habitable world, to try them that dwell upon the earth". (@Revelation 3: 10).
The period of great tribulation is described in @Revelation 6 - 18. To read those chapters is enough to make the heart quake: what will it be to go through the terrible realities which are there so vividly described? But where is the church during that fearful time?
She is seen on earth up to the end of @Revelation 3, but in chapters 4 and 5 she appears in heaven under the figure of twenty-four crowned elders round about the throne. God has taken pains to let us see that the church will be complete and in glory before a seal is opened, a trumpet sounded, or a bowl poured out.
Then *after* that great tribulation shall all the tribes of the earth see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory (@Matthew 24: 29, 30). *Then* shall the Lord Jesus Christ be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels, "in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who know not God, and those who do not obey the glad tidings of our Lord Jesus Christ" (@2 Thessalonians 1: 8). This is the event proclaimed in @Revelation 1: 7, "Behold, he comes with the clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they which have pierced him, and all the tribes of the land shall wail because of him".
{164}
NOTES OF A READING @1 CORINTHIANS 15: 51 - 58
Ques. What is the difference between this and the special communication made to the Thessalonians?
C.A.C. The point here was, what we have noticed before, a new order. To the Thessalonians that was not touched upon, it was a question of dead persons there. If man was to be recovered from death, resurrection must come in. This is the bringing out of the new and heavenly order and that could not be brought out until there was a heavenly One. Until Christ had taken His place in resurrection there was not a heavenly one. Martha's thought was a pretty general one, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day" (@John 11: 24). In Old Testament times there was very little light as to what is outside life on earth. All this chapter turns on Christ being risen and being now a heavenly Man, He is the heavenly One. This chapter is not to establish the fact of resurrection, but the new order is what gives it its importance; it is what gives character to christianity. The point is, risen *with Christ*. If you get association, it is of His order. I think Christ as He is is so little known by any of us. Certain historical facts are believed, but have we got a present, living Christ for our hearts today? If so, what sort of a Christ is He? He is a risen Christ. To reach a risen Person one must go through death; there is no other way.
Ques. What do you mean?
C.A.C. It is just a simple fact that a risen Person does not belong to this side of things at all; He can only be reached the other side of death. We see it in figure in the children of Israel; they had to go through the Red Sea and they had to go through the Jordan.
Ques. What is going to help one to reach Christ?
C.A.C. Do you not think we need to know a little
{165}
more of the attraction of Christ? He is God's great attractive Centre. It brings a new Object before us altogether, and it engages our affections with Himself. The power of God is needed just as much in this as for a sinner in his sins. We must begin by learning Him as Lord. He administers all grace and blessing. If we truly learn that, we should soon apprehend what Christ is as Head; there is a new beginning for God's pleasure. It has been said that the fear of the Egyptians moved Israel much more than the attractions of Canaan. Then there is a great deal of self-interest in seeking God. It is really when we begin to seek the pleasure of God that we begin to see things rightly. It is a very blessed thing for us to see that He has taken us up to be bound up in "the bundle of the living" with Him for His pleasure.
Ques. When does the call of God take place?
C.A.C. I think there must be a sense of being called of God very early in the soul's history. I think normally a soul would be conscious of having the Spirit. There would be the full consciousness of being called of God when he has the Spirit. No one could taste the joy of grace without being conscious that it is all of God. There is very little apprehension of Christ as Head. It is very remarkable how God has brought it out in recent years.
Ques. What is the difference between this scripture and @1 Thessalonians 4?
C.A.C. Thessalonians is for those just converted; it was given to comfort their hearts as to some who had died. The subject is the same here, but more in its own proper bearing. This is the complement of the other, it fills it out. There is one point in Thessalonians that goes further than here, "caught up". It is the "Lord himself" that shall descend. There is nothing here about the saints being caught up. Death is swallowed up in victory. He does speak of being at home with the Lord. That gives the nearest to what people think of going to heaven. There is nothing here
{166}
that would lead us to suppose that we are taken off the earth.
There is a remarkable expression used here, "the sting of death is sin, and the power of sin the law" (verse 56). It is remarkable coming in in a place where you would not expect to find it. It is not the same as the law of sin and death in @Romans 8: 2. It is Moses law here, I suppose.
Ques. Does he mean the law of sin in its condemning power?
C.A.C. @Romans 7 speaks of law. "I was alive without the law", etc. That brings in the sense of condemnation of the law. This is experimental, the bitter sting of death, and the strength of sin is the law. The victory is over everything connected with sin and death. It is very interesting to see how he begins the chapter (@1 Corinthians 15) with the gospel, and he comes back to the gospel again at the end. Many true Christians are afraid to look death in the face. This chapter shows how the Christian can look death in the face; it is not so much to give us light as to the future. It is of importance as placing the Christian in his true position of triumph and victory. It is very encouraging to see what is in Scripture because it is there for us; no one need be discouraged by thinking there is so much there that he knows nothing about; if I am not in it, it is all there for me. It is like a man coming into an estate, and after some years he finds it is a great deal larger than he knew of; but he would not be despondent about that; he would perhaps be humbled to think that he had not travelled over his estate a little more quickly.
Ques. Why does it say victory by our Lord Jesus Christ, not, as Romans puts it, deliverance "through Jesus Christ our Lord" (@Romans 7: 25)?
C.A.C. I think as to victory over sin practically one has really to find that He alone is the source of power. It is so important to see that we have a resource. Our responsibility is to use our privileges. It seems to me it is
{167}
like this: there is virtue in Christ and it has to come out of Him to us, like the woman who came to Jesus and touched the hem of His garment and virtue went out of Him to her; it is like that. There must be virtue come out of Him, and it is the virtue that comes out of Him that helps. I think it is a wonderful moment for a soul engaged in conflict when he comes to it that Christ can never fail. You are like a cork on a big billow. You are amid a tempest of evil and He has stood by you. Not only have you escaped the evil but you have positive gain, because you would not have known Christ in that way if you had been without it. I think there is many a soul that is walking in victory without much doctrinal knowledge.
{168}
NOTES OF A READING @1 CORINTHIANS 15: 48 - 58
C.A.C. We have to do with the last Adam.
Ques. What is the meaning of the last Adam?
C.A.C. I thought it was God's Head. The first man was head of creation in a way, but he was not really capable of being the head, and as soon as he was tested he failed, and God went back to His original thought. The last Adam is never superseded. Just as the inbreathing of God gave man natural life so the inbreathing of Christ -- of His Spirit -- into the disciples gave them spiritual life in connection with the new creation. A wonderful new order of things has begun for God, and the great thing is to live in that order of things; and how are we going to live in those things unless we have the Spirit of Christ? We are to know Him as the life-giving Spirit, as the Head. My own impression is that the Son of God as presented in the gospel of John is the last Adam. As I apprehend Him as the Head I get the blessing which attaches to Him in that character. It is a great thing that the Son of God has called us to Himself that He might quicken us. Quickening in the scriptural sense means made to live, and to live in a new sphere of things -- to live spiritually in new things, in a new order of life altogether, in association with Him as the risen One. All these things, as to getting the good of them, are matters for exercise and prayer. The mischief is that people have taken it for granted that because they are believers they have everything. It is a great thing to know the Lord as the life-giving Spirit. Every blessing lies in the apprehension of Christ; it is not something I have in myself. Every blessing in christianity is that I have some fresh apprehension of Christ. We have a great deal in our minds that we have not in our souls. It is so very attractive when you know that the Father has given you to Christ. Getting to know Him better -- that is growth.
{169}
I think life is connected with the presence of the Spirit. If a man has the Spirit, in one sense he has everything. @Exodus 15 is an illustration of this.
They were in the joy of redemption and singing the song, "My strength and song is Jah, and he is become my salvation: This is my God, and I will glorify him". They speak of a habitation, and if you look at the Darby Translation you will see that all is in the past tense: "Thou by thy mercy hast led forth the people that thou hast redeemed; Thou hast guided them by thy strength unto the abode of thy holiness. The peoples heard it, they were afraid: A thrill seized the inhabitants of Philistia. Then the princes of Edom were amazed; The mighty men of Moab, trembling hath seized them; All the inhabitants of Canaan melted away. Fear and dread fall upon them; By the greatness of thine arm they are still as a stone; Till thy people pass over, Jehovah, till the people pass over that thou hast purchased" (verses 13 - 16). In that sense they were in the land. For a brief moment they tasted it, but they had not taken possession. They were in spirit in the land, enemies all gone and singing the song. That is like a soul in the joy of redemption. In the Spirit he is in the land, but then he has a long journey to take and there are many exercises on the way. There is not only life in a new sphere of things but there is life in power.
Ques. In what sense?
C.A.C. The body is to be presented a living sacrifice. Christ is to come out in the body of a believer, and that is a very practical expression of life. The qualities of the heavenly Man are to come out in the saints. What marks the new order is that it is heavenly and spiritual. The saint waits for the fulness of it until he gets his glorified body; spiritually we belong to that order now. The true character of saints will be brought out in display. There is no outward display now; it is all known in the Spirit; but at that moment the saints will be seen truly as heavenly ones. We
{170}
now bear the image of the man made out of dust, the heavenly is spiritual.
Ques. What is that "changed" in verse 51?
C.A.C. In spirit we anticipate the rapture. In Ephesians "raised ... up together" and seated in heavenly places is all spiritual and anticipative of the rapture. We await the rapture to bring us into it actually.
Ques. What is the mystery?
C.A.C. It is what had not been made known before. The Spirit has let us into the secret now. The mysteries in Scripture can be well understood by those who have the Spirit. People in flesh and blood on the earth will be subjects in the kingdom, but the heavenly saints will reign with Christ. It is men after a new order that will inherit the kingdom. There are the two sides of the kingdom, the reigning side and the subject side. The earthly saints will be the subjects in the kingdom and the heavenly saints will be reigning. You are prepared to reign in the kingdom by suffering now. There will be three nations in special blessing, Egypt, Assyria and Israel, but others will come into the light of the city. The truth of the kingdom of God has a very great place in Scripture.
Ques. Which, did you say, were the nations that will be blessed?
C.A.C. Egypt (Gentile), Assyria (Gentile), and Israel His inheritance. "In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth; whom Jehovah of hosts will bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine inheritance!" (@Isaiah 19: 24, 25). So that even in that day God acts in sovereign right, He does His own will and pleasure. The light of God shines for the church in Christ mediatorially. It shines for Israel in the church and it shines for the nations in Israel, so that it comes down step by step mediatorially. God has lighted a candle to give light to everyone in the house, and the church is the light of God
{171}
for the world today. It will come out in the city, the city is the light of the Lamb to the nations below. The light shines out from the city, "The glory of God has enlightened it, and the lamp thereof is the Lamb. And the nations shall walk by its light" (@Revelation 21: 23, 24).
"We shall all be changed" (verse 51) shows what the power of God can do in a moment. It is victory now. God has apparently been sustaining defeat for many years. The victory has been won but it has not been displayed yet. What the saint can say now is, "Thanks to God, who gives us the victory by our Lord Jesus Christ". That is, we are so in the light of all that marvellous work that the saint can be in the joy of it all now, but there is going to be outward victory too. Death is swallowed up by our Lord Jesus Christ. You get the thought of *putting on* the new order in verse 53: "put on incorruptibility ... . put on immortality". It is like @2 Corinthians 5: 4, "but clothed". It seems to me it is the best robe in the full sense of it. We shall never have the best robe in its completeness until we have our glorified bodies -- until we have "put on". It is like the psalmist says, "All glorious is the king's daughter" that is within, and by and by the outside will match with the inside, "Her clothing is of wrought gold" (@Psalm 45: 13). He speaks of a wonderful treasure in an earthen vessel in @2 Corinthians 4, and in chapter 5 he speaks of how the heavenly treasure will be in a heavenly vessel. It is the entire setting aside of the earthly, nothing left but what is of Christ. "So then, my beloved brethren, be firm, immovable, abounding always in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil is not in vain in the Lord" (verse 58). (Note it is, "So *then*".) Every saint is called to work and stand and walk in the light of resurrection. It is what the Lord had before Him Himself. He went through everything in view of resurrection. If you do that, people do not take any account of you, you are nothing, you go down now, but you will go up by and by; go on in the light of resurrection, having this glorious future
{172}
before you, and you do not go down then. Not one bit of labour for the Lord is going to be lost. The Lord laboured in vain and for nought; He says, "I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought and in vain" (@Isaiah 49: 4). The apostle Paul seemed to labour in vain as to present result, for all in Asia forsook him. You do not find a servant of the Lord in Scripture who laboured and was made much of in this world. Every bit of labour for the Lord is gathering up for that day. We get our eye on today instead of on tomorrow. Keep your eye on tomorrow -- the resurrection morrow. Nothing is going to be lost, you have the certainty of results then, we are on the winning side, all that is of the Lord will stand. Paul always had tomorrow in view. Labour is not in vain *in the Lord*. J.N.D. said, 'Christianity is marked by what it brings, not by what it finds'.

NOTES OF A READING @1 CORINTHIANS 15: 58; @1 CORINTHIANS 16: 1
C.A.C. These doubts and questions that had come in at Corinth had evidently an unsettling effect on their minds, and what affects the mind would naturally affect the activities.
Ques. Does verse 58 not show too that all labour is in view of resurrection? It is not by looking at present results that the servant is encouraged.
C.A.C. He may not see much now. The labour is in the Lord. Everything that is for God is really the work of the Lord. It is labour in spiritual things. Those who labour in spiritual things do so in view of resurrection; it is in that sphere, so that if the truth of resurrection is enfeebled the work of the Lord is enfeebled also. The Lord supports what is of Himself, He sees to it that what is of Himself will not fall to the ground. The "work of the Lord" is a great work, it is not a superficial thing. And what the Lord does there is no mistake about. When the Lord takes a soul in hand He makes a good job of it. You see an example of that in this epistle. The apostle was faithful to the Corinthians, and the Lord supported it. He brought the Lord in and then he was steadfast and unmovable. He says about Timothy, "He works the work of the Lord, even as I". The epistles to Timothy show what is to characterise the servant of the Lord and his work. It is nice to recognise the Timothys as well as the Pauls. The note to chapter 16: 15 (J.N.D.) reads 'appointed themselves'. It is good to see that there is room for volunteers. The gifts are in a way pressed men. I suppose "what was lacking on your part" (verse 17) was probably temporal things. It is no small service to care for the saints in a temporal way, caring for the poor. There might be a good deal of need where there was not actual poverty; that is where we are tested in a practical way, and I
{174}
am sure practical care one for another and practical help as we have opportunity is an important thing as to the saints. And that comes out in the collection for the saints. He is pressing a good deal the practical side here. J.N.D. thought that consideration and care for the poor and the needs of the saints were very much more important than we had any idea of; it shows what the care of the house of God is. The natural selfishness of the heart has to be corrected; naturally we are selfish and like to keep what we have to ourselves. I think the apostle was greatly exercised as to the collection. He writes two chapters about it in the next epistle. It was the moral side, the seal of his ministry; the grace in the Gentile ministering to the poor Jews and the grace in the Jews taking it from them. So that the Jew was actually thanking God for the Gentiles. It accomplished more a great deal than the conference at Jerusalem. That was only the Gentile let in on sufferance. This practical ministry did far more than the discourse of @Acts 15. There is the practical binding of saints together; we all admit the doctrine, but there is to be the practical working out. The great thing is to open the heart and let grace shine in, and then it will produce its fruits. All the practical side of christianity flows from that. The word of God is like the seed and it grows up and brings forth fruit. The apostle speaks of the word effectually working in those that believe.
Where the Lord is working the activity of the enemy is sure to be found (chapter 16: 9). I think that whatever the Lord is doing, there is always some kind of adversary to defeat that particular thing. There is something very fine in the way the apostle speaks of his coming to them and about Apollos coming to them. He does not allow any coldness of affection to come in on his part. It shows how his whole spirit was in the fulness of grace. When things are not as we like we turn away and feel annoyed, but not so with the apostle. It only shows how entirely superior to what was
{175}
natural the servant could be. Though they had been speaking evil of his ministry, he was thinking only of their spiritual good. He was pained for their sakes; he was a true parent, he was laying up for the children. He was gracious enough to wish Apollos to go to them and he was gracious enough not to go himself. Apollos, like the apostle, was waiting his opportunity. Every servant has to wait sometimes until his course is clear.
{176}
CONCERNING THE COLLECTION
@1 Corinthians 16: 1 - 9; @2 Corinthians 8: 1 - 24; @2 Corinthians 9: 1 - 15
A question having been raised as to the propriety of the custom of having a collection when the Lord's supper is eaten, it is well that we should see how Scripture presents the subject of the saints giving.
From the earliest day of the assembly, the breaking of bread and prayers were accompanied by a distribution "according as any one might have need" (@Acts 2: 45). The unity of heart and soul which marked the multitude of believers was evidenced by the great grace in which they were ready to give. There was a divine administration of spiritual wealth through the apostles, and a corresponding answer in what the saints freely laid at their feet (@Acts 4: 32 - 37).
The Holy Spirit has called our attention to this as a primary feature of the assembly -- one might say, a constitutional feature of it. There is no intimation that it was enjoined by apostolic authority. It was entirely spontaneous: the practical evidence that the new commandment governed the assembly. They loved one another as the Son of God had loved them (@John 13: 34, 35), and were thus known to be disciples of His. The thing true in Him had become true in them (@1 John 2: 8). How precious this must have been to Him who had given Himself in order to secure a company who should love one another as He had loved them!
Love to one another was in no sense a rival to affection for Him. It was rather the witness of true love for Him that they kept His commandment to love one another (@John 14: 15, 21). It was far from a Judas-thought for the poor, which was only, as the Spirit of God has been careful to tell us, a cloak for selfishness and greed, and for utter indifference to Christ. The covenant had secured, as typically of old, the
{177}
affections of the people of God so that they offered from willing hearts. All flowed, not from legal enactment, but from lively affections. It was in keeping with the character of things -- so delightful to God -- which marked @Exodus 35: 20 - 35; @Exodus 36: 1 - 7 and @1 Chronicles 29: 6 - 17.
When they were in the land, the inheritance bestowed in the love of God upon His chosen and called people yielded wealth for tithes, for offerings, for gifts to those "treasuries" which had so definite a place in the house of Jehovah (@1 Chronicles 28: 11, 12). It was the divine giving echoed back by a willing-hearted people. The Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, the widow were all to be thought of and cared for, as we see repeatedly in Deuteronomy. It was the evidence that Jehovah Himself had the place which He loved in the affections of His people, and that His own blessed character was reproduced in them.
Assembly giving cannot be separated from its blessed Source in the giving of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ. There could not be any disparity, or incongruity in character, between the love that gives in divine Persons and the love which that love begets in the children of God, and which prompts their giving.
The spirit of all this was realised in the assembly at Jerusalem, and it is to be sorrowfully noted that the first manifestation of the working of evil in the assembly was the attempt to have credit for devotedness of this kind when the reality of it was not in the heart. And the first difficulty which arose in the assembly was in connection with the ministration of that bounty which the love of the disciples made available -- a ministration which needed men "full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom" (@Acts 6: 3).
Then when James and Cephas and John gave Paul and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship in their going to the nations, they desired that a similar grace should be found amongst gentile believers; "only that we should remember the poor, which same thing also I was diligent to do" (@Galatians 2: 10).
{178}
And Paul's parting word to the elders of Ephesus was a touching reminder that the Lord Jesus "himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive" (@Acts 20: 35).
In writing to the saints in Rome, Paul speaks of the contribution of Macedonia and Achaia for the poor in Jerusalem as a matter of righteousness: "They are their debtors" (@Romans 15: 27). And to the Corinthians he claims as a "right" that those that announce the glad tidings should "live of the glad tidings" (@1 Corinthians 9: 14), though he is careful to say that personally he had not used that right. Both in Romans and in I Corinthians the righteous claim is insisted on, and in 1 Corinthians definite direction is given as to it being rendered.
It is noticeable that it is not said precisely when the contributions of the saints should be put together. This is left to be determined by the spiritual intelligence of the saints. In keeping with this the choice of deacons (@Acts 6) and of those who should carry the bounty of the saints (@1 Corinthians 16: 3; @2 Corinthians 8: 19, 23) was left to those whose bounty was to be administered. The Lord would leave it in the hands of those whose love was expressed in it; they could be trusted to act suitably as to detail without precise commandments.
But Paul does speak definitely of each putting by at home, "laying up in whatever degree he may have prospered", and this "on the first of the week". He links the exercise as to giving with "the first of the week", and thus with all that that day would speak of to a spiritual mind. There is no hint as to what proportion of one's income should be put by. In @Numbers 18 there is a tithe from all Israel for the children of Levi, but in @Deuteronomy 12 and 14 there is a second tithe to be eaten before Jehovah in the place which He would choose, and there is even a third tithe mentioned in @Deuteronomy 14: 28, 29. This would indicate that with increased prosperity in the land there would be an enlarged outlet for the affections of the people
{179}
towards Jehovah and towards each other. He would not limit their giving to one tithe or even to two. There is no prescribing in @1 Corinthians 16 whether one, two, or three tithes are to be given; it is simply said, "in whatever degree he may have prospered". The proportion is left to be assessed by personal devotedness. And we can surely see that this is according to the love and liberty of the dispensation.
It is well that we should regard this exercise as to putting by at home on the first of the week. It would provide a ready and dedicated fund which could be drawn from, whether for contributing to the collection of assembly character, or for needs that might present themselves to us individually.
But it is not until 2 Corinthians that the subject is put on its true spiritual basis; then the apostle's heart was set free to write to a self-judged company who had cleared themselves of evil. He would not only speak to such a company of the ministry of the new covenant and of reconciliation, but he would make known "the grace of God bestowed in the assemblies of Macedonia" (@2 Corinthians 8: 1). He would speak of this as not unworthy to be dwelt upon in great detail alongside with the glorious subjects of his spiritual ministry. It was, indeed, the fruit in the saints of that ministry, and was in correspondence with it -- the grace and actings of divine Persons characterising assemblies of saints who had been "transformed according to the same image" (@2 Corinthians 3: 18).
The circumstances in which the grace of God had manifested itself gave peculiar lustre and glory to it. "That in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty has abounded to the riches of their freehearted liberality". It was out of "deep poverty" that this contribution was made, but poverty and great trial of affliction accompanied by abundance of joy. The spiritual springs from which the liberality flowed are emphasised by
{180}
this touching reference. The inward and spiritual went far beyond what was material. "Beyond their power, they were willing of their own accord, begging of us with much entreaty to give effect to the grace and fellowship of the service".
It was not that Paul had entreated them to give, but they had entreated that they might be permitted "the grace and fellowship of the service". They were not abundant in carnal things; on that side it was "deep poverty"; but they were abundant in joy and in the riches of free-hearted liberality, and in the grace and fellowship of service to the saints. Indeed, they had given themselves first to the Lord and to Paul and those with him by God's will. There had been complete self-dedication, and "this grace also" of giving abounded as a result; it proved the genuineness of love; it was the evidence of the presence of elements of a profoundly spiritual character.
It is noticeable how the apostle puts the whole subject in these chapters on a most elevated plane. The action of divine Persons is presented as the model, and nothing can be more spiritual than that. Think of the moving strength of such an appeal as this! "For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that for your sakes he, being rich, became poor, in order that ye by his poverty might be enriched".
And then he concludes his appeal by saying, "Thanks be to God for his unspeakable free gift" (@2 Corinthians 9: 15). The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, God's unspeakable free giving, and the grace of God bestowed in the assemblies are linked together in a very blessed way, as having the same precious character, and in perfect harmony one with another.
The spirit of giving in the saints is the evidence of their having been "transformed according to the same image".
How delightful is this to the blessed God, and to His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ! The primary and cherished thought of God has been realised: men are in God's image, after His likeness. It comes out, truly, in things that are "according to
{181}
their power" -- even "carnal things", as Paul would say in another place -- but what comes out is a condition of mind and affection which is patterned after divine Persons.
It may be that the Lord intends to give us a much more exalted and spiritual conception of the whole subject of giving, and to show us that it is characteristic of God's assembly -- part of the very constitution of that assembly -- because it is characteristic of the blessed God Himself, and is therefore a peculiar delight to Him as manifested in His saints. It is not the amount of what we give that has value -- that would be a carnal estimate of it -- but the "spirit of blessing" in which it is given, rendering it delightful to God as being according to what He is Himself. The widow's two mites probably represented a greater devotion of heart than the munificent gifts of Solomon at the dedication of the temple. It is not the amount of our contributions that give them value, but the state of heart of which they speak to the Lord.
Then we may note how spiritual are the elements which appear in those who have to do with this matter. God is thanked for giving diligent zeal as to it in the heart of Titus. A "brother whose praise is in the glad tidings through all the assemblies" is "chosen by the assemblies as our fellow-traveller with this grace, ministered by us to the glory of the Lord himself".
It is striking that one peculiarly esteemed in connection with his setting forth of the glad tidings should be chosen by the assemblies for this service. It seems to suggest that the one who could well set forth the grace of God to men was best fitted to carry the expression of His grace in men. It shows how the assemblies in that early day linked together the grace set forth in divine Persons with the grace bestowed in the assemblies. It was, indeed, the same grace, but peculiarly sweet as seen produced in men, through divine working, who had shortly before been so far from God. Hence "the glory of the Lord himself" was secured by
{182}
it; the brethren who were entrusted with the service of it were "deputed messengers of assemblies, Christ's glory". It is all put on a most elevated spiritual plane. It may be that sometimes "the collection" is looked at as a mere matter of pounds, shillings and pence, and as having to do with meeting righteous obligations of various kinds. It is true that obligations have to be met, but even these have to be met according to the dignity of an assembly which is God's assembly, and which is passing through this world in the spirit of @Deuteronomy 2: 28, declining to be indebted for favours to anyone here; discharging all that is due; owing no man anything. But assembly giving must not be disconnected in the mind from all that is the true spring of it, or it may become to us carnal rather than spiritual. It would then have no longer the character of the grace of God bestowed, or the expression of the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ; it would lose all that is rightly connected with it as a manifestation of "Christ's glory". It might then be felt that there was something incongruous between the Supper and the collection.
In this connection the quotation from @Psalm 112 is very illuminating (@2 Corinthians 9: 9), for in that psalm we see stated of the man that fears Jehovah the same things as are said of Jehovah Himself in @Psalm 111. It is God expressed in His people, and hence their "free-hearted liberality ... works through us thanksgiving to God. Because the ministration of this service is not only filling up the measure of what is lacking to the saints, but also abounding by many thanksgivings to God; they glorifying God through the proof of this ministration, by reason of your subjection, by profession, to the glad tidings of the Christ, and your free hearted liberality in communicating towards them and towards all; and in their supplication for you, full of ardent desire for you, on account of the exceeding grace of God which is upon you" (@2 Corinthians 9: 11 - 14).
If the collection thus carries with it the expression of
{183}
Christ's glory and God's glory it is truly correspondent with the loaf and the cup of the Lord's supper. It is the practical witness that the saints are in mind and spirit in accord with that which they are calling to mind. The Lord loves to link with what He has done the precious fruit of it in those who love Him (@Matthew 26: 13). It can be easily understood that Paul would hardly enlarge on it when writing to a carnal people in regard to the order due to the Lord in relation to eating His supper. But to a self-judged and repentant company who had recognised what was due to the Lord in His supper he would write at much length on what was involved spiritually in the Supper; namely, the ministry of the new covenant and reconciliation, and the expression of the grace of God and of Christ in a practical way in the saints.
What flows out of the affections of the saints as divinely taught is of the same order and character as the grace which has flowed out of the heart of Christ and out of the heart of God. I think the Lord would elevate our thoughts as to it more to the level of His own. In presenting His own love and the love of God to us He would not exclude our love; He would rather call it into lively activity. What would the Supper be to Him if the affections of His saints were excluded from it? Is it not His peculiar portion to have those affections, and to see them flowing in warmth and freshness amongst His own and to one another?
In the light of this the collection is surely very sweet to Him. Not indeed the carnal element in it, but the spiritual grace and affections of which it is the expression, and apart from which it is a mere formality, just as the Supper itself is a mere formality if not eaten in the freshness of holy affection for Him whose supper it is. The Lord has exercised us about the spiritual import of the supper, and He would not have us indifferent to the spiritual import of the collection. We may be sure He would not have spoken to us so fully through His apostle about it if it had not much
{184}
importance in His sight. I think we may say that it is an essential feature of the assemblies as divinely constituted.
In the light of this it is surely not inappropriate that the collection should have a definite place when the saints come together in assembly. The "customs" of the "assemblies of God" are not to be lightly regarded (see @1 Corinthians 11: 16), for if they have their origin in spiritual sensibilities and intuitions -- as they would have normally -- they have divine value. The spiritual intelligence and affections of the saints as wisdom's children qualify them to work out in wisdom what is suitable to God in His assembly. Assembly affections, governed by the letter and spirit of many scriptures, have led to the recognition of the collection as an important feature of the assembly, and therefore not unworthy of a definite place when the saints come together in assembly. We love to dwell adoringly on the love of divine Persons, and then that there should be opportunity for the expression in a practical way of the love of the saints. Both form a spiritual basis for being led into holy and heavenly privilege on the one hand, or, on the other, instructed by the Head in view of our place here in testimony.
The collection is a practical expression of the fact that the saints love the Lord and they love His people and His interests. It is out of such affections that everything can be secured that is for the pleasure of divine love. The whole structure of the tabernacle was the outcome of the willing-hearted gifts of God's people; it all came out of their affections, developed through His working under the influence of His known grace and love. If there is a company marked by love to the Lord and love to the saints, everything that is for His pleasure can be brought about. The gift of the Spirit, the coming of the Son of God to His own, His manifestation of Himself, the Father's love, are all brought in on the ground of "If ye love me" (@John 14: 15). If the collection does not speak of active affections in
{185}
the saints -- affections of true assembly character -- it has no spiritual value under the eye of the Lord that would justify it being associated with His supper. But if it does, it is a delight to Him as an expression of affections which He died to secure.
God Himself is the Source of all ability to give, whether it be the actual means or -- what is much greater -- the disposition to give. All is of Him that is for Him (see @2 Corinthians 9: 8 - 11).
It is well to ponder @1 Chronicles 29 in this connection. They were glorious days in Israel's history when "with perfect heart they offered willingly to Jehovah". Whenever this is the case the giving is in a spirit of worship; it brings the blessedness of God before the heart. There is hardly a loftier note in the Old Testament than the outpouring of David's heart in connection with the willing offerings for the house of God. All was traced to Jehovah exalted as Head over all -- all of His hand and all His own -- but He tried the heart and had pleasure in uprightness; He delighted in the state of heart which led to willing offering. "And I know, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. In the uprightness of my heart have I willingly offered all these things; and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, offer willingly to thee. Jehovah, God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and direct their hearts to thee!" Even the collection should be imbued with the spirit of this great and glorious scene, and if so it would be no unworthy part of the service of the assembly. It would be truly "an odour of sweet savour, an acceptable sacrifice, agreeable to God" (@Philippians 4: 18).
We do not eat the Lord's supper as risen with Christ -- the truth of the Supper is in 1 Corinthians, not in Colossians -- but as those who affectionately own His lordship in the place where He died. It is locally partaken of in each place
{186}
where saints come together in assembly. And it would seem to be appropriate that the collection should be taken immediately after the Supper rather than at a later period. To take it after the meeting was over would hardly sufficiently recognise its assembly character. To have it at the end of the meeting would make it a formal conclusion to assembly privilege, which cannot really be concluded, for it is spiritual and eternal in character. The collection, like the Supper itself, is part of what pertains to the order of the assembly as convened locally rather than of what appertains to the assembly viewed as in heavenly associations and privilege.
{187}
SECOND EPISTLE TO THE CORINTHIANS
{188}
{189}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CORINTHIANS 1: 1 - 24
C.A.C. The apostle is now free to speak of the things on God's side which he could not do in the first epistle. There he drew the contrast between milk and meat. Here I think things are taken up more on the divine side -- it is positive ministry. It is very interesting to see that all that the apostle brought out in this epistle had been the comfort of his own soul when he was heart-broken about them. The things that had been a comfort to him in exercise he could pass on to them now that they are in exercise. The first epistle is much more on the general ground of christianity, the second epistle supposes a people really attached to Christ and anointed and sealed. The same exercise had been going on in the apostle and in the Corinthians, only he had been going through it with God and they as being guilty in the matter.
The assembly at Corinth was brought to its proper moral condition by the exercise it went through. If ministry is to be of any good to us there must be state of soul; it is very much the parable of the sower; there is the divine seed and the divine work. There must be a preparatory work of the Spirit in the soul. There is nothing of the work of God apart from exercise of soul. There is exercise of conscience and heart too and that is the work of God. It is just the same as with the new birth. "The wind blows where it will, and thou hearest its voice, but knowest not whence it comes and where it goes" (@John 3: 8). It is like "O God, have compassion on me, the sinner" (@Luke 18: 13); that is the sound.
There were some at Corinth as much exercised as the apostle; he speaks of some. 1 Corinthians is the firmament of His power, 2 Corinthians gives us the sanctuary side of things -- they are the two spheres where God is praised; one
{190}
is the outside and the other the inside. The Supper brings before us that every other man is gone and only Christ remains. Christ is the Yea. It was really the positive stability of all the counsels of God in Christ. It is a contrast to all that had gone before. God had been setting forth His Yea, and man had been answering Nay, and now Christ has come; He is the Yea -- everything that is of God and for God. When you come to the Son of God there is the perfect revelation of God in Him; then everything that is for God; it is all yea.
Ques. What is "for glory to God by us" (verse 20)?
C.A.C. I thought His glory was that He is the Minister of the new covenant -- the intelligence and praise of it is in the saints. If the saints do not give the praise of it, who will? It is an Old Testament thought, "Thou that dwellest amid the praises of Israel" (@Psalm 22: 3).
Ques. What are the "promises" (verse 20)?
C.A.C. As the power of evil encroached on God's domain, God gave a promise to meet it. There are three great classes of promise. The first, as to sin and death; God answered that by the promise that the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head. Second, the confusion of Babel; God answered that in His promise to Abraham; the seed of Abraham brings in what answers all the confusion. Third, weakness, man's inability to hold the field for God; God met that by His promise to David. The seed of David brought in One who could hold all for God. David at the end of his life has to say, "Although my house be not so before God" (@2 Samuel 23: 5), yet his heart turns to One who could hold it all for God. God brings out what He is in face of all the power of evil. God establishes everything in Christ and then He anoints us. I think the sealing means that one carries God's mark in this world. "God, who also has sealed us" (verse 22). Everything in Christ carried the Father's seal in the presence of men; if they had known the Father at all they would have known the seal. God has a
{191}
people in this world who carry His mark; that is what sealing is. It is a wonderful thing to be in this world carrying God's mark. The anointing is what qualifies a man to fill the position in which he is set. Christ was perfectly competent as anointed to fulfil everything that He undertook. I think morally the anointing precedes the sealing. The true power of the gospel is the setting forth of the Son of God. I suppose that by the preaching of the Son of God the assembly is formed. "On this rock I will build my assembly" (@Matthew 16: 18). You think of the strength of the testimony in a place where saints have come to the Son of God. The preaching of the Son of God takes in both sides: the revelation of God, and what God has brought about. Whenever He is spoken of as the Christ, it is His office. As to the Son of God, it is more His Person you think of.
{192}
THE ANOINTING, THE SEALING AND THE EARNEST
@2 Corinthians 1: 21, 22
It is most important that we should understand the positive character of what has been preached to us as made good in the Son of God, Jesus Christ. If we were content to have things in Christ, and to let every other man drop out of sight, there would be glory to God by us. God would establish us in Christ, or, as it might read, firmly attach us to Christ, or connect us firmly with Him. And this is a collective or corporate matter, set forth in the words "us with you". This is a work of God which is common to Paul and all those who can be said to be in Christ. There is not only the preaching, and all the positive blessedness of what is preached, but a mighty work of God forming an unbreakable bond between Christ and a company of persons in this world who have become the subjects of divine favour. The whole matter is presented here as of God; there is no admixture of any other element. This is all the more striking when we think of the next sentence, "To spare you I have not yet come to Corinth". He speaks of what is true on the line of divine operations; this is what God is doing; Paul does not raise any question about it being understood on their part, or known in its experimental power. Exercises on that line would follow the reading of the epistle, no doubt, but he states here the great and blessed reality of what God has done. Scripture has largely this character, and saints are able to take it up according to the measure of their spiritual exercise. So that the question arises as to how much it means to us? We may be sure these statements meant much more to Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus than they did to the saints generally at Corinth, or perhaps to ourselves, but they come
{193}
before us again and again so that they may acquire a much greater meaning to us than they have had before.
The firmly attaching to Christ may be illustrated by what happened when He was here. The gospels show us a number of men and women who were not loose hangers-on; there were sometimes crowds of people who professed faith in Him, but they were not firmly attached to Him; they drifted off and walked no more with Him when certain features of the truth came out. Some loved glory from men rather than glory from God. But there were some of whom the Lord could say, "Those thou hast given me I have guarded, and not one of them has perished" (@John 17: 12). Not one whom God has firmly attached to Christ will ever be detached from Him. There might be some amongst them at Corinth who had never been thus attached, as there are many in the christian profession generally, but Paul has in mind here what God had done. He is occupied with the positive, and for the moment with that only.
"And has anointed us". I think this refers to the public position in which they were set up as the assembly of God in Corinth. There was idolatry there, and great schools of philosophy, and there was a synagogue, but there was something far greater than all these. There was the assembly of God as an anointed company. It was not that they had anointed men amongst them to carry on the service of God, but the whole company was anointed. Every brother and sister has part in the anointed vessel; there is no lack of competency. For that is the thought of the anointing; it confers a competency which is of God. One longs that this should come much more into evidence. And all have responsibility as to this, for the service can never be beyond the general state without becoming more or less artificial. Power in the meetings cannot be expected to go beyond the general state and condition, so that we must be in the power of the anointing in our households and in everyday life if we want to be in the power of the
{194}
anointing in the meetings. The anointing gives depth, and that is what is wanted in the meetings, not length. The longer we are, without depth the shallower the stream becomes. Whereas in Zion Jehovah becomes glorious, "a place of rivers, of broad streams", as Isaiah said (chap 33: 21).
The anointing gets a great filling out of meaning as we trace the ingredients in @Exodus 30. It is "a perfume of perfumery after the work of the perfumer". "Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured". Things anointed become holy. None of it is to be put on any strange thing.
"Who also has sealed us". The Son of man gives food which abides unto life eternal, "for him has the Father sealed, even God". (@John 6: 27). He carried the Father's mark. An angel ascends from the sunrising having the seal of the living God to seal the bondmen of our God upon their foreheads (@Revelation 7: 2, 3). In Christ we have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, "the promise of the Father, which ... ye have heard of me" (@Acts 1: 4). The Spirit is specially connected with the Father. The exalted Jesus received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit and poured out that which the people beheld and heard. I take it that the seal is to appear, which would be conveyed in the bondmen being sealed upon their foreheads. In the light of this how impossible to think of an invisible church!
"And given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts". The Spirit is an actual part of our eternal portion. God has wrought us for an eternal condition of glory, and the Spirit will be part of it. There will be no other power to enter upon what is in Christ even in eternity.

SUMMARY OF A READING @2 CORINTHIANS 3: 1 - 18
The saints themselves were the letters of commendation -- they were the evidence to the apostle of his work, and this was a comfort to him. He thinks of himself first and then he takes a wider view -- our letter, and then known and read of *all men*. It was a cheer to him that God had really used him, and they were the testimony. Christ was the Writer, the apostle the pen and the Spirit the Ink; the tables the hearts of the saints. It is in contrast to the tables of stone; the saints are the tables of testimony. Christ is writing what God is toward man, not a demand as to what man is to be toward Him. What we get here puts the saints in an important place as being God's testimony in this world. Every bit of the knowledge of God that is in the heart of man is written there by Christ. Christ is One that can make a divine impression in our hearts. The great thing is that there should be a people here for Him according to God so as to be a testimony. When Christ was here on earth in grace, the attitude and testimony of God were perfectly set forth, and that is carried on now in the saints. "Transformed according to the same image" is behaving according to grace. The great point is that there is a divine impression of God in our hearts which is derived entirely from Christ. The greatness of Christ is that He brings us the knowledge of God, that is His glory here. It is a question of what God is for man, not, as in the Old Testament, what man is to be for God. God had come out in the way of demand but now He is coming out in the way of ministry -- supply. It is a glory that confers and conforms, it does not demand. All blessing even in the Old Testament times was on the ground of grace. Faith always links itself on to God in grace; that is the great characteristic of faith in all ages.
In @Psalm 119 it is a question of quickening all through;
{196}
that is, everything has to become living in the soul.
The glory of the Lord is that He is the Mediator of the new covenant. The glory of God is in the face of Jesus Christ. The Lord is a Man and the glory of that Man is that He is the image of God, and every glory is set forth in that Man. The crown of all is in Jesus.
Sacrifice is one element of God's ways, promise is another, and resurrection is a great principle of God's ways, and all has come out in Christ. Sacrifice speaks of righteousness and holiness, resurrection of power, and promise of grace and faithfulness, and all has come out in Him. God has certain defined ways and those ways find their full expression in Christ. All that God is morally is revealed in His ways. All that God is has come out in a Man; it is most wonderful! If we beheld that a little more it would have a great effect upon us. I do not think it had come out in its full radiancy until Christ died and was raised again.
{197}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CORINTHIANS 3: 17, 18; @2 CORINTHIANS 4: 1 - 18
Ques. "The Lord is the Spirit", what does that mean?
C.A.C. I suppose it is connected with the end of verse 6, "The letter kills, but the Spirit quickens". Then there is a long parenthesis, and then, "Now the Lord is the Spirit" (verse 17). It is the spirit of the new covenant in contrast to the letter; the letter being external. Man needs what is spirit, not what is letter. Whatever a man really has, he must have it in spirit, the letter is external.
There is a wonderful effect produced by beholding the glory of the Lord; you are changed, and that is what the letter never did for anybody. The letter kills but the Spirit quickens. It is really the spirit of the thing; for instance, the apostle in chapter 4 says, "*We* also believe, therefore also we speak" (verse 13). That is, the apostle was occupied with the spirit of the thing, not the letter -- the very life of the thing. You want the life of it, and each one must find the life of it in the Lord, and it is as each one gets it in that blessed Person we get life. It is not merely a text of Scripture, it is a Person. The gospel is not preached simply to teach people Scripture but to bring them to a Person. God has unveiled His glory in a Man, He has brought it near to us in a Man.
Ques. What does it mean by His glory?
C.A.C. I think all that God is has come out in a Man, and in connection with our deep need too. It is a very great thing to see that; very much depends on which side we look at the gospel. I may look at it as how it affects me, and all that is very true and very blessed, but it is not what Paul calls "my glad tidings" (@2 Timothy 2: 8). By the fall God's creature has lost the knowledge of God altogether, and God has come out in the gospel to make Himself known, and if that is the case the blessing must be infinite; it must be
{198}
worthy of the Giver. The apostle was anxious that we should see the gospel from the divine side. All is coming out in a Person. The Christian ought to think it his privilege to speak a good word for God, if I may put it so. You feel that people do not know Him. To know Him is to love Him. God will never be content until we love Him with all our heart. In the Old Testament, God says, "My son, give me thy heart" (@Proverbs 23: 26), and in the New He says, 'I have given you My heart'. That produces a different effect, and that is, that I give Him mine. It is a very marvellous thing that God has given His Son and His Spirit; and I ask myself, what is it for? It is that I may know Him. You must have the two things: there is a perfect revelation in the Son, and a perfect capacity to enjoy it in the Spirit. We only get things as we feel the need of them. It is a great principle with God that "He hath satisfied the longing soul and filled the hungry soul with good" (@Psalm 107: 9). The new birth is God working in man so that he has desires after God. Nicodemus is an illustration of a man seeking after God. He says to Jesus, "We know that thou art come a teacher from God, for none can do these signs that thou doest unless God be with him" (@John 3: 2). There was a longing in the heart of that man for the knowledge of God, and that is what the new birth produces. What a wonderful thing that God should open out to Nicodemus things that He had never opened out before. The One who was the revelation of God was before him, and He opened out that wonderful gospel that nobody had ever heard before. Nothing could be available for us without His death, that comes out in @John 3. "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus must the Son of man be lifted up". The death of Christ is brought in immediately, and that is the very way in which the love of God has come to light for us.
The word of God was so precious and holy that the apostle was anxious that nothing should cast a shade on the glory of this wonderful testimony. I think the apostle was a
{199}
*changed* man himself, he was an illustration of what it is to be changed. His exercise at the end of this chapter (4) was that the life of Jesus should be coming out in his mortal body.
God has shone out (verse 6), and when Paul comes to the practical side it is the life of Jesus; that is the way that the glory of God must express itself in a world of sin.
<blockquote>'There only could He fully trace <br>A life divine below'. (`6:2)</blockquote>
If we have the privilege of knowing God in His glory as set forth in Christ glorified, the other side is that the life of Jesus must come out here. If you are ministering the gospel of the glory you must express the life of Jesus -- the life of that holy, dependent, lowly Man as He was here. And one feels that nothing else comports with the gospel of the glory of Christ. What goes along with that? The life of Jesus; you see it coming out in Stephen very markedly. He is an example of one who saw the glory of God, and how did he come out down here? He just comes out as Jesus came out. It is lovely to see it. It is one of the most blessed things in the gospel that it is a power to make us like Christ. You are actually changed so as to be like Him. The glory of the law was a consuming fire, but the gospel of the glory is a conforming power. You remember the old lines,
<blockquote>'Run, run and work, the law demands, <br>But gives me neither feet nor hands; <br>But sweeter sounds the gospel brings, <br>It bids me fly and gives me wings'. </blockquote>
What a wonderful thing that such a man as I am can be given power to be here expressing the life of Jesus! I may think I am a poor thing, what can I do? But He gives me power. One is not surprised that the devil tries to blind minds to that. The Christian has seen the image of God in a Man. I think our great business as Christians is to put Christ
{200}
before people. It is the only thing that will satisfy thirst. We must not forget that there are thousands of souls in this world who are longing for some knowledge of God, and we need to be diligent. The Spirit of God is here and He is diligent. There is one diligent Person here at any rate. The woman in @Luke 15 lights a candle and sweeps the house and seeks *diligently* till she finds the lost piece of silver.
The great thing that people need is light -- she lights a candle. It is a great thing if you or I can be a vessel to carry that blessed light of God revealed in grace.
"God who spoke that out of darkness light should shine who has shone in our hearts for the shining forth" (verse 6), and that is true in principle for all Christians. If the knowledge has shone in, it is for the shining out. It is not anything of ourselves, we are only vessels, and vessels simply carry what is put in them. We have to be nothing but vessels, we simply have to hold what is put in us, "that the surpassingness of the power may be of God, and not from us".
It is a very great subject, the glory of God in the face of Jesus, it takes some travelling over. God has been pleased to bring out His glory in many different ways, but all those ways reach their fulness in Christ. Promise has been a great element in the ways of God. A promise sets forth two things, His grace and His faithfulness; that is, when God has made known His grace, it is made good in blessing through His faithfulness, and all this is seen in Christ. If you want really to understand the glory of God you must survey the whole field of promises, and you see them all in Christ. In Him is the Yea and the Amen of them all.
Another element in God's ways is sacrifice. You see God bringing out the great principle of sacrifice from the garden of Eden right down; in connection with the tabernacle too. In sacrifice you see the righteousness and holiness of God, but these could not be met by the sacrifice in themselves. They all pointed to Christ. You see it all through the Old
{201}
Testament and it all leads up to Christ.
Another great principle is resurrection; you get it all through the Old Testament. Resurrection is the display of God's power. We see the grace and faithfulness of God, His righteousness and holiness, and His power, and behind all we see His majesty and His love. You could spend eternity in meditating upon it. It is "the shining forth of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ". It is God shining out, and what God wants is that our hearts should be the vessels of His glory. And God wants all this known in the *affections* of men and not as a lot of dry doctrine. Then this glorious gospel does not take men out of the exercises of the pathway here, you see that very plainly in verses 8 - 10. God turns the exercises of the way to profit and blessing. It is a blessed thing if we go through them in heavenly light.
'And heavenly light makes all things bright, Seen in that blissful gaze'.
It makes all the difference. The apostle was able to go through the exercises in divine power. It is not that he did not feel them, for God means us to feel things. What a remarkable word that is in @Colossians 1: 11, "Strengthened with all power according to the might of his glory unto all endurance and longsuffering with joy". You are made to feel things, but the power of the glory enables one to endure things with joy. I find a very little suffering soon clips my wings. It is because we know so little of the power of His glory. We may not know much about joy in it, but when souls are really exercised they are able to justify the ways of God. You feel that God's ways are good. The Christian is a paradox, "As grieved, but always rejoicing; as poor, but enriching many; as having nothing, and possessing all things" (@2 Corinthians 6: 10). The apostle was afflicted every way. When *we* have trouble and sorrow *we* are straitened, the apostle was not straitened (verse 8). He
{202}
could not see any way out and yet his way was not entirely shut up. You might find moment by moment God opens the way out. The old woman said she was 'never so hedged up that she could not see a way out at the top'.
There is not much apparent triumphal progress in that, and yet that is the way God carries His saints in triumph. God says, I will not lessen a bit of your exercise and trial, but I will lead you through in triumph. It is a fine thing to be a Christian after all.
{203}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CORINTHIANS 4: 1 - 18
Ques. What is "the Spirit of the Lord" (chapter 3: 17)?
C.A.C. It is the Lord in that special character. It goes back to verse 6. I thought it was that grace is thoroughly known, not only objectively, but the Spirit of the Lord is given. Liberty is freedom of soul with God. It is an immense thing to have this liberty; it arises from knowing God's disposition towards us, so that a man can be happy and free with God. It is quite a different thing from knowing God in your circumstances. The Spirit of God dwelling in man is characteristically the Spirit of Christ. Here it is the Spirit of the Mediator. We have the Spirit of that One. It is very much like the love of God shed abroad in the heart; it comes very near to that practically. It is really here in verse 17 in connection with our being confirmed in grace -- the true grace of God. It seems to me that when a soul is free it is at liberty to be occupied with God's mind. God's mind becomes very interesting and attractive. It is a great thing to be kept on the line of beholding the glory of the Lord. We have always to be called back to it. The crowning point of the new covenant is that His people know God and will be satisfied with His goodness. There is no element of bondage connected with the goodness of God. "My people shall be satisfied with my goodness" (@Jeremiah 31: 14). I think the assembly properly is the sphere of liberty. "Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother" (@Galatians 4: 26).
"Looking on the glory of the Lord". All the goodness and grace of God to man had really come out in the Lord -- all that God is in grace has come out in a Man. There is a Man great enough to give expression to all that God is in grace. In reading the gospels, more particularly the gospel of Luke, we want to see the glory of the Lord. You see Him
{204}
showing out the glory of God in grace. If you put all the incidents together you get a very good idea of the glory of the Lord, and by beholding that you are changed into the same image. Levi beheld (@Luke 5: 27 - 29), and we see in him a man who was really in the communion of grace. You see a man so affected by grace that he goes and does the same thing as the Lord did -- he is changed into the same image. Like as to the good Samaritan, He says, "Go, and do thou likewise".
Here it is a question of the covenant. Moses came down after being with God to bring down what God was, and he had to veil the glory. Now One comes down and clears the ground in grace and makes known God's grace. The grace of God is what is made known by redemption. Death is the basis of it all. Moses prayed, "Let me ... see thy glory". God put him in a cleft of the rock and covered him with His hand (@Exodus 33: 18 - 23); Moses as man after the flesh is hidden and God's glory is shown; and that takes place in the death of Christ, man is hidden and God's glory comes out. We have to come to it to be hidden in the cleft of the rock. God says, "There is a place by me"; those words "by me" are the point. Grace is obnoxious to man; he will tolerate law but will not have grace. In @Luke 4 they wonder at the gracious words that proceed out of the Lord's mouth, but immediately He brings grace home to them they take Him out and want to throw Him down the precipice. Many are praying to God to be helped to keep the law, but how many are praying that they may truly and deeply appreciate His grace?
Ques. What is "this ministry" (chapter 4: 1).
C.A.C. The new covenant ministry; God had made the apostle a competent new covenant minister -- the gospel is in verse 3. Everything is included in the gospel.
Ques. What is "manifestation of the truth" (verse 2)?
C.A.C. It is important to keep to the conscience. When people raise points, touch their conscience and they
{205}
are done for. Ask them about their sins, and it is new light on the subject. There is no hope for those in verse 3. I suppose the conscience of man is always on God's side. When a man is going on wrongly, he is not only not going on with God but he is not going on with himself; he has a conscience and his conscience is protesting. Of course the longer a man violates his conscience, the less it troubles him. Even a poet of the world has said, 'Thus conscience does make cowards of us all'.
{206}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CORINTHIANS 4: 11 - 18; @2 CORINTHIANS 5: 1 - 10
C.A.C. There was a working of death in the apostle. God took care that death should work on everything that was of the flesh in Paul. The character of the gospel is the bringing out of the glory of God; that was the ministry of the apostle. All the lowliness, gentleness, and meekness of Jesus was suited to the way in which He came. If God came into this world He must come in either at the top or at the bottom, and it pleased Him to come in at the bottom.
Ques. How do you understand "the dying of Jesus" (verse 10)?
C.A.C. Is it not pretty much christianity to be always looking for death here? I suppose if we got a little more into this gospel it would put us pretty much on this line. It is through death, and that is where we are deficient, we know so little about it. The discipline of God comes in when we are set for that way, when we have accepted that way.
Ques. What is the meaning of "the life also of Jesus"?
C.A.C. We see in Jesus One who was always thinking about others -- faithfulness to God and love to man -- there was never any consideration of Himself. We look at everything pretty much as it affects ourselves.
Ques. What is "the same spirit of faith" (verse 13)?
C.A.C. All that belonged to faith was really found in the life of Jesus. It was all the outcome of faith. The wonderful thing is that in the life of Jesus we see the life of a Man who had perfect confidence in God, and the gospel is come that we might walk in the same spirit and the same life. The apostle was following on in the life of Jesus and was content to die in His service.
Ques. Why does he say, "All things are for your sakes" (verse 15)?
{207}
C.A.C. All that was in his soul was confirmed and strengthened -- the inward man was renewed, the outward was consumed.
Ques. What does "our momentary and light affliction" mean (verse 17)?
C.A.C. I thought it was all helping to carry on the work of God in his soul. God had a place for Paul in His system of glory, and everything was helping to fit him for it. The afflictions of saints whatever they have been will be seen by and by to have contributed to God's great end. God was behind it all; it was pre-eminently so in Paul's case.
Ques. What "things" are these (verse 18)?
C.A.C. "The things", I suppose, that he is talking to them about in this epistle. These things were engaging his own eyes and he was seeking to engage the eyes of the Corinthians with them.
{208}
NEW CREATION
@2 Corinthians 5: 1 - 21
New creation brings in a further thought (than reconciliation): there is a positive divine work in the saints which will issue ultimately in the holy city ... . New creation is a subsisting fact when the soul receives the Spirit and is consciously in Christ. "If any one be in Christ, there is a new creation" (@2 Corinthians 5: 17).
Everything in @Luke 15 is based on reconciliation. The father could not run and cover the prodigal with kisses if reconciliation had not been effected. The peculiarity about @Luke 15 is that it does not tell the secret ... . We see the Fulness reconciling. @Luke 15 is the glorifying of the supreme grace in which divine Persons are acting ... .
We begin small in it ... but the babe in Christ is a constituent part of new creation. He is part of that immense spiritual system which will be eternally for the pleasure of God. To grasp new creation fully we must apprehend with all saints the breadth and length and depth and height ... . (Insofar as there is new creation the city exists now; we have come to it, and it has come down morally.) What we read in @Revelation 21 and 22 is of deepest interest; it shows the character of what pertains to new creation; those things we sang of in `206:1 pertain to new creation. We can measure ourselves in a way by the holy city, and particularly by the internal life of the city.
The "in Christ" is the secret of new creation. "If any man be in Christ, ... new creation". I think it means we have come to be in Christ vitally, He has become the tree of life to us; all that Christ is becomes subjectively our life through the Spirit ... .
The twelve fruits (@Revelation 22: 2) are the completeness of Christ in His ability to maintain the saints in spiritual freshness and vigour in every season of the spiritual year.
{209}
As being in Christ we touch new creation and if in Christ we want to use Him. What are we in Christ for? Is it only a doctrine? Or is it for headship, a perennial source of supply? If we are in Christ we are in the Head for supply. It ought to be a great exercise for us to be kept in the freshness which pertains to new creation.
In order to get the fruit of the tree of life we have to be overcomers ... . Then we sometimes fail to wash our robes ... . All our personal habits and associations have to be brought under the moral application of the word; a truly exercised heart cannot bear that there should be a spot unsuited for Christ, a single thing that God cannot pronounce very good ... .
There are no *streets* in the city ..., there is only one street; all move in one direction -- in the energy of the divine nature. I think Christians generally are greatly hindered by looking at these figures literally. The street is the movement of the city; it is of gold, that is new creation character -- all things of God ... . We can have a bit of that now; we should not need to have to hide our motives or to be opaque like the world ... . In the divine nature we can afford to be transparent -- "pure gold, as transparent glass". Pure gold can never be got without a refining process. It is a comfort to know that the saints are in the crucible of divine discipline in order that the dross, tin and alloy may be all got rid of and nothing but the fine gold of Ophir be left. God is going to bring His saints out as fine gold; there will be no suspicions in the holy city, no distrust, no uncertainty about the motives of each one. We want to cultivate a little of that now; that is the practical side of things.
The tree of life was not forbidden. God intimated to Adam that He had something in reserve far better than the old creation -- the promise of life in Christ before the ages of time had begun to run their course ... . They ignored the tree of life; Eve speaks as if there were only one tree ... .
{210}
Then we have the river. There is nothing more interesting than to see how the tree, the street and the river are all mixed up together; that is, all the movements of the city and the tree of life and the river blend together. All movement in the divine nature has Christ as its spring and origin, and it is in the power of the Spirit. Anybody trying to make a drawing of this would be puzzled! It was never meant for that; it is a moral conception ... . If we want an illustration of it we shall get it in @Acts 2: 4. We see a sample there of what the city will be; all the movements of the divine nature were in relation to Christ and were carried out in the power of the Spirit. Alas! it did not last long.
@John 8 is reconciliation. "God was in Christ" etc. In @John 13 - 17 we have what answers to the city; it is the city viewed in its moral display in contrast to the present state of things ... .
"They shall see his face; and his name is on their foreheads" (@Revelation 22: 4). The crown of the old creation was, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness" (@Genesis 1: 26). That was the cherished thought of God, and His primary thought will be fully realised when His name is on the foreheads of His saints and they become the image of God and His likeness.
{211}
SUMMARY OF A READING @2 CORINTHIANS 5: 1 - 21
"We know" is christian knowledge, I think. The apostle again touches on the subject of the glorified condition of the saints. Resurrection had been an important subject in his first epistle. The apostle has before him a new and eternal order of things, all the fruit of the work of God. He that wrought us for the selfsame thing is God; it is God's eternal thought and purpose, what lies outside man's course as a responsible creature here.
It is not here like in @John 14, it is in contrast to our earthly tabernacle, it is a building from God. God has something before Him not made out of dust; he contrasts all that is of the flesh and all that is of God -- the earthly thing and the heavenly. Here all is seen as the work of God, the body suited to the heavens; man as made out of dust was suited to the earth. God is in no way satisfied with restoring what has perished; it is not that He reinstates man into his forfeited place. In verse 3 he has the completion of the work of God before him. In @Philippians 1: 23, 24, Paul is telling us how he settled the matter, for their sakes he would remain. He does not stop short of the final issue of the work of God, nothing else has a personal satisfaction for him. It is bringing in life really so that everything is swallowed up that is not life. It is very important that the christian hope should come out. When he enters the epistle of christian experience (Philippians) it is the christian attitude in view of departing. "The earnest of the Spirit" (verse 5) is, I think, the earnest of the full result -- the earnest of this very thing. In @Romans 8 it is the same thought, the redemption of the body. The Spirit does not engage the heart with anything short of the glory. Nothing short of being like Christ is the goal before the christian company. Our present bodily condition is more or less a burden. The
{212}
saint is connected with the old creation in his mortal body, and in that sense he groans. The whole creation groans, everything is out of joint, everything groans and the Christian groans as connected with it. I think faith always has in view what is of God; God has an eternal system before Him and He is going to bring us into it. All His work is in view of that.
The thought of divine purpose never overlooks responsibility. The apostle had confidence in full light of divine purpose and yet a holy exercise as to responsibility, and the two are always kept together in the soul by the Spirit. What strikes me about the judgment-seat of Christ (verse 10) is that we shall have the Lord's judgment about everything; the happiest thing possible for the saint is to be in accord with the Lord's mind about what He does. Some things in our history we may find out after some time are all wrong, and we are therefore gainers; things done last week we would not do now, in the light of the judgment seat, so we have gained by it. I may be in the dark and not know if I have His mind or not, but at the judgment-seat we get His mind about everything, and that is what we want.
J.N.D. used to say we should greatly value that we are always the subjects of God's dealing in mercy. Up to our conversion we were quite blind, and light will be thrown on all that. You can quite understand that if people have not purged consciences, anything of judgment in any shape or form would make them uneasy. The gospel remedies that. All this is put in to exercise their consciences; the effect on Paul was that it led him to persuade men. This did not raise questions for him, it made him think of men. All the time that Christ sits as Judge is really covered by the judgment-seat of Christ. It has often been said that "his wife has made herself ready" (@Revelation 19: 7) is that she has passed the judgment-seat. Judgment is wider than penalty; it is often taken up in connection with the infliction of punishment, but it is more often the discrimination of things. We say a man has sound judgment. A judicial award is founded on a
{213}
holy discrimination; the character of everything is thoroughly brought to light. A judge does not always condemn; take a dog show, for example. A judge is often as much concerned in the approval of what is excellent as in the condemning of the guilty.
The apostle was always zealous to be agreeable to the Lord. He cultivated the judgment-seat of Christ all along and was not putting it off to the future. The sense of having the Lord's mind about things is a very real thing. It is a very distinct thing to have the Lord's mind, and particularly if you have had a different mind before; our own mind has to go; it is very humiliating, but a great reality. You find as to the bride it was granted to her that she should be arrayed in fine linen -- the righteous acts of saints. The fine linen is the righteousness of saints. The bride is seen to be adorned with all that is of the Spirit. There will be seen in the saint the display of all that has characterised that saint spiritually, it will all be distinctly seen. Many of those in whom the most fruit of the Spirit is seen are quite out of sight at the present time and perhaps many have not the opportunity of its coming out, but it will all come out some day. There may be those "boasting in countenance, and not in heart", the apostle has in mind those who were making a fair show at the present time. He is insisting on reality in all this -- there must be reality in having to do with divine Persons, and there were those at Corinth evidently who were not on this line. Whatever God has wrought in the soul cannot be lost. You may depend upon it that the Lord loves to show His approbation of all that is of and for Himself, He never forgets a good point. "I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land not sown" (@Jeremiah 2: 2). He forgets our sins but never the good. "I will pardon their iniquity, and their sin will I remember no more" (@Jeremiah 31: 34). It has been said that when God speaks of an Old Testament saint in the New, He never records anything to his discredit; He calls Lot a righteous man.
{214}
SUMMARY OF A READING @2 CORINTHIANS 5: 12 - 21
The apostle anticipated the judgment-seat. If anyone is fully manifested to God now, there is nothing to add. The saint always welcomes the light of God; one is not a saint otherwise. The difference between one born of God and a natural man is that he loves the light and the natural man hates it. If we are born of the light we cannot hate it; the saint is formed by the light. The government of God works out down here, not at the judgment-seat. If I do wrong, in the government of God I eat the fruit of my own way. If everyone travelled through Romans he would only do good; he would live outside every influence here and present his body a living sacrifice. Nothing is going to satisfy God but having His saints in perfect suitability to and holy accord with Himself. The saint at the judgment-seat gets everything measured according to Christ; Christ is the criterion of everything; it would be a loss to me not to have a divine estimate of my course down here. The judgment-seat of Christ is the end of man's responsibility; God winds up everything worthily of Himself by giving the saint His estimate of it all. Everything must be according to the standard of Christ. The saint here is not supposed to be a mixture of good and evil but he is set up with a capacity equal to his responsibility. Paul was so manifested to God that he had not anything to go over. J.N.D. said when dying that he could say, 'Christ has been my only Object, I am not aware of anything to recall, little now to add'. That is the result of really being manifested to God as you go along; and if we are thus manifested there would not be a sudden blaze of light throwing up a lot of hideous things in the past. The apostle knew what it was to be with God without the intrusion of a single thought that was of himself -- we cannot say this (see J.N.D. note b, verse 13). The
{215}
Christian can be outside himself with God in all the blessedness of what God is; it is his highest privilege. Then the apostle was held by the love of Christ. I suppose the love of Christ would be probably Godward, the devoted love which has taken up everything for God. The love of Christ held him; it holds me, that is the thought, the love in which Christ has taken up everything for God, the removing all the old and bringing in all the new even at the expense of laying down His life. It was what characterised that Man; it is all in relation to God, the obedience of Christ and the love of Christ. It had its outflow manward, but the essential point was what it was Godward. He died for all to bring to a termination that race -- man after the flesh. All is removed that was unsuitable to God that there might be a people in connection with life being in relation to God's Head. The general bearing of the passage is that old things being removed, the love of Christ comes out in that way.
"All have died" (verse 14) is judicial, not moral. Man after the flesh has gone in the death of Christ; all is now in new creation. The whole scene is terminated before God, "The end of all flesh is come before me" (@Genesis 6: 13), and now everything that lives is in relation to the living One; there is no other life. The love of Christ is a love that has come out in a particular way, a way that sets aside man after the flesh. I think there is a tendency to lose sight of the way in which the love of Christ has come out. The point is that God has lost man, and Christ has recovered man for God in new creation, not after the flesh, having judicially terminated all that he was in his old position. The apostle enforces the need of new creation; everything connected with the old had to be entirely set aside that we might be formed in a new state. We cannot walk with God except on new creation lines; we must walk with God in the place that God puts us; we must be with God on another footing altogether. We all have to find out for ourselves that as natural men we hate God. There are times in our history
{216}
when we would curse God to His face, which is grievous to the believer to find it, but so it is. We are by nature akin to the devil; it is a wonderful thing that Christ comes in with another Man; I have another Man's life and righteousness, I rejoice in that.
{217}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CORINTHIANS 5: 14 - 21
C.A.C. Nothing could be more sweeping than what the apostle says here as to "know no one according to flesh".
Rem. He is taking account of a man as before God.
C.A.C. Yes, that is the attitude of a man who is living to the One who died for him and has been raised. With all our light, and we have a lot of ministry, yet how few of us come near to where the apostle was in this chapter. All the old things were really gone in the death of Christ, and in connection with Christ raised all things had become new. Everything that sin had touched had to go that there might be an entirely new beginning for God. Everything was good and beautiful as God created it, and sin came in and touched it all, and the mark of sin stands connected with all that is after the flesh. What is seen in Christ is the absolutely glorious setting forth of the righteousness of God and in new creation nothing is seen but 'God's righteousness with glory bright'.
Ques. There is no discouragement, is there?
C.A.C. No, that would not be the circle where reconciliation is known, would it? Everything is quite of a new order now. If there was anything perfect in the flesh it could certainly be found in Christ, and yet the apostle says we do not now know Him any more after the flesh; it must be a new order. If we are occupied with ourselves we are occupied with imperfection. The love of Christ is that which held the apostle, and the love of Christ holds us. In God's new world everything is in relation to Christ, and in the old world everything stood in relation to Adam. You get the same thought constantly in Scripture, He becomes the gathering centre in attraction to Himself. "I, if I be lifted up out of the earth, will draw all to me" (@John 12: 32). And again, "He should also gather together into one the children
{218}
of God who were scattered abroad" (@John 11: 52).
Then there is the fresh claim of redemption that God has acquired (verse 15). It is a wonderful thing to be able to take that ground; they were to live in relation to Christ, and if I do not live in relation to Christ I do not live at all. In all our relations with God there is nothing but what is *of* God. The soul is put in liberty. "He hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done it" (@Isaiah 38: 15). We have to come to God, and it is a blessed thing to come to God. When we come there we find nothing but Christ; we are not occupied with ourselves, we disappear and Christ remains. Practically we are a long way from God sometimes. There is no greater joy than to see that there is only one Man before God. I see another man very often and that makes me value the death of Christ.
The old things in the case of the apostle were good things after the flesh; he surpassed everybody on that line, but he was very thankful to let it all go. Many have never come to this point until their deathbed when they are obliged to let themselves go and see nothing but Christ. It is a pity not to come to this a little sooner. There is no conflict in your place with God. The point is, on what ground am I with God when alone with Him? A man derives all his power and his character from God; if I am right in the inner circle I come out in the power of it to meet all the difficulties and complications outside. There must be a learning of things experimentally. We are now set in divine grace in company with the Holy Spirit who always resists the things of the flesh so that we may not do the things that we would wish to do. If you come to think of it, it is incredible that God should give us these wonderful things and then leave us to get on as best we can at the mercy of everything. We encourage one another in the things of God; the more we have to do with divine Persons the more we are encouraged. There are so many difficulties because souls do not know the true grace of God; souls want
{219}
evangelising. If we only had the gift of evangelisation what a lot of good we might do; it is greatly needed even amongst people supposed to be Christians.
Ques. What is "the ministry of that reconciliation" (verse 18)?
C.A.C. There were the two things, the ministry of reconciliation that God had given to the apostles, and the word of reconciliation that He had also put in the apostles; they not only had an official ministry but the thing was really in them. Then everything in Scripture is for us -- what the apostles had is all for us in a way -- "Ask, and it shall be given to you. Seek, and ye shall find. Knock, and it shall be opened to you" (@Matthew 7: 7). There is no other way of getting on; it is constantly presented in Scripture. "Diligently seek him" (@Hebrews 11: 6, Authorised Version). And if these things are worth having, they are worth seeking. I think we shall all be able to say this, that if we have in any way set our faces that way we have got a great deal more than we expected. "Things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that love him" (@1 Corinthians 2: 9). "Be reconciled to God". It means that the soul comes on to the ground where there is nothing but Christ. When Christ was here after the flesh God was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself; that was God's approach to man; everything was according to Christ, and that gives character to reconciliation. When the people came to Him with their sins, diseases or infirmities, all were met in Christ; it was because God was in Christ; they came under the influence of all that God was. All that God does is according to Christ. If I see that God's coming to me is according to Christ then everything in my coming to God must be according to Christ. One is the kiss and the other the best robe. It is a wonderful thing to be kissed by God. I have said sometimes to people, 'Have you been kissed?' And they have said, 'I do not know what you mean', which
{220}
shows they have not. You cannot be kissed by God and not know it.
Ques. Is that @Romans 5: 1?
C.A.C. Yes. You get the powerful and overwhelming sense in your soul that God loves you. The love of God is *poured out* -- it is an energetic word! It is a wonderful moment. The prodigal knew the kiss, it showed that all was clear on the father's side. The best robe added nothing to the father's delight; it was as great before as after, but it altered everything on the prodigal's side. That is another aspect of reconciliation. The best robe is to meet every thought of fitness in the soul which is quickened by God and equipped in suitability to God. When we see what it is to be made the righteousness of God in Him, that settles the whole question.
Ques. Is verse 18 apostolic?
C.A.C. The ministry of the apostles is living and abides. The scripture says, "The things thou hast heard of me ... entrust to faithful men" (@2 Timothy 2: 2). It is supposed to be handed and kept alive -- the apostles ministry was never to become dead. They were body and soul in it, they laid themselves out that this blessed ministry should find its way into hearts. The great thing is to preach Christ, what we know of Christ, however little we may know. If we speak of Christ there is a sweet savour about it; people are refreshed and comforted even when they do not properly enter into it. We are not simple in our joy in Christ. "He preached unto him Jesus". The great thing is that people should be impressed with a Person; what is going to deliver if it is not the blessed and satisfying power of Christ in the heart? What else is going to bring the soul out of its graveclothes? Nothing but Christ. If you get the preaching of Christ you have a new Person brought in.
{221}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CORINTHIANS 5: 19 - 21; @2 CORINTHIANS 6: 1 - 13
Ques. When is a man in Christ?
C.A.C. I thought there was progress in it; I do not think anyone is in Christ all at once.
Ques. To what scripture would you turn for the first apprehension of this?
C.A.C. There is a scripture (@1 Corinthians 1: 30) which speaks of "in Christ". I think if a soul has come to the apprehension of Christ as his righteousness, he has come to the first touch of it. @Romans 8: 1 is another experience. I think a man was in Christ in contrast to his experience under law. It is not so much the righteousness of God as the new atmosphere a soul is breathing.
Ques. What would be the difference between us in Christ and Christ in us?
C.A.C. One is the answer to the other.
Ques. What are the "old things" (verse 17)?
C.A.C. The things that sin had touched. Nothing adds to the kiss; it was the father's kiss that was the witness of the father's love, and the next thing is the best robe. It is what the apostle is doing here, if you would only stand still and let him put it on you.
The Urim and the Thummim are light and perfection. The Urim are Luke's gospel, the Thummim John's. The breastplate was all within the span of a man's hand. The Urim are the light of all that God is, the Thummim are perfection in man Godward. It is a great thing to see that the revelation of God is in relation to man; God was pleased to create man capable of knowing Him. The whole revelation of God is bound up with man, The glory of God is in the face of Jesus Christ. It has all come out in that way.
This chapter is the doctrine of the divine parable in @Luke 15,
{222}
new creation. In the house the prodigal was suited to the father's eye. We cannot enter into the truth of the assembly until we are in the good of reconciliation -- God has pleasure in me.
Ques. What is the word of reconciliation?
C.A.C. The apostles had the testimony of it in their own souls. I think that verse 18 is the idea of all true ministry -- ministry not only as to terms, but it is expressed. What a servant is impresses people much more than what he says. It is important that the true character of a thing should be seen in a vessel livingly; it might otherwise be taken up mentally. People ought to be afraid of taking things up mentally. There was no place given to the flesh, nothing had any place but Christ (verse 20). It characterised the full walk and life of the apostles. I think the great point was that the saints should be near to God according to God's own way. A great many accept the truth without being near to God. And he wanted them to be personally near to God according to the truth.
{223}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CORINTHIANS 5: 20, 21; @2 CORINTHIANS 6: 1 - 18
Ques. "God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself". Does that refer to any particular time when Christ was here?
C.A.C. God was in Christ (verse 19) reconciling, etc. Everything was on the footing of what Christ was; all God's ways with man were according to what Christ was. I thought that every bit of grace that was in Christ was on the ground of His death. In Luke, "good pleasure in men" was reconciliation; God had good pleasure in men. The point here (verse 19) is God was reconciling. There was great pleasure for God in having Christ under His own eye. "Ye have had affection for me, and have believed that I came out from God" (@John 16: 27). That gives the idea of reconciliation. There is a bond of contact between God and men.
Ques. What is it on our side to come into the good of reconciliation?
C.A.C. I thought it was this, that really God has found His infinite delight in Christ and He has called us into that circle; it is like the prodigal. In new creation it is not sinful nature that is in view, but God's delight; and the work of the evangelist is not really done until souls have come into a circle where there is positive delight for God. If I think of myself as a man, I am gone, and there is nothing before God but Christ.
The ministry of the new covenant is the setting forth of what God is to sinful man, but reconciliation is that there is delight for God in man. I think you see the activity of divine love in this ministry, thus put in Paul; there is a beseeching character about it, a warmth. In all true ministry there is a warmth and earnestness; that God is beseeching, God is seeking to win man by His earnestness.
{224}
Ques. How do we answer to this earnest beseeching practically?
C.A.C. I think to take it in is the most important thing.
We find ourselves with God on an entirely new footing if we take it in.
I think he turns in the next chapter (6) to the things that hinder. The apostle says, as it were, I have set such wonderful things before you, how is it that you are so small? He turns round pretty sharply on to the practical side; he says, as it were, if you want to be led into these blessed things you must be separate. Chapter 5: 21 is about the biggest verse in Scripture. Man has been a dishonour to God, he has been a libel on God's character, but in new creation everything that is worthy of God will be displayed in us. God has dealt with sin in a right way on the cross, and it is all going to come out in new creation. As J.N.D. puts it in his hymn, 'God's righteousness with glory bright' (`88:4). Righteousness and glory go together more than once in Scripture. Righteousness is often used very much in the sense of faithfulness. It is a matter of righteousness with God to effect His own purposes. New creation will be the display of the righteousness of God. Everything there will be eternally right. Everything will be of God so that it is not creature righteousness but God's righteousness. If it were creature righteousness it would drag down as creature innocence did, but it is God's righteousness and that is all right, it is satisfactory to God.
{225}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CORINTHIANS 6: 1 - 18
Rem. The ministry was not to be a dead letter, but to find a living expression.
C.A.C. I suppose it is really what belongs to the day of Christ's rejection -- something for God in me. Everything that was of God and for God was set forth in ministry with the idea of the thing really working out. The apostle was anxious that the ministry should not suffer, that nothing should bring a cloud on the glory -- the ministry having come into the world, the great thing is that it should not be clouded; it is not being concerned about our character to keep up a religious reputation.
Verse 4 shows the power to go against the stream. In @Philippians 1: 28 it is, "Not frightened in anything by the opposers". It is evidence of the power of God to go on, right in the teeth of everything. Everything was against the apostle's ministry. I suppose we have to be tested in different ways, especially those who take up God's service in any way. It brought out in the apostle that he was a true man. We can all get on very well when in favour, the question is how we get on when things are contrary. We might easily get high-minded as to doctrine, but the practical side comes in as a check. You get the doctrine in Romans; there he says, 'Now I will show you the photograph of a man who is in the good of all this'. I suppose we only understand the doctrine as we are formed by the Spirit in the things.
Ques. What is God's temple?
C.A.C. It seems to me a very holy thing to be said of the saints that they are the temple of the living God.
Ques. Why "living God"?
C.A.C. We are very feeble in our apprehension that God is here; the general idea is that God is in heaven and
{226}
we hope to get there some day, whereas the great thing of the present moment is that God is here. People of the established church have a greater reverence for stones and bricks -- the material building -- than we have for God's building. The reverence they have in flesh, we ought to have in the Spirit and be the moral expression of what God is. God comes into the soul by blessed ministry; it all works out very simply and naturally, if we are only simple enough; there is nothing very complicated in christianity. The temple is a place where you are entirely withdrawn from all the influence of man; it is the shrine, and you are initiated there into things that are entirely outside the sphere of man.
Ques. What is the difference between the temple and the kingdom?
C.A.C. You must be initiated to get into the temple; there are mysteries; you must be a priest to have anything to say to the temple. It puts us outside man in the flesh altogether, for we are not priests according to the flesh. In verse 18 you are outside man's resources. God would say, 'If you be for Me I will be for you'.
Rem. If I am wanted in the place where Jesus is, I shall be cared for in the place where Jesus was.
{227}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CORINTHIANS 6: 11 - 18; @2 CORINTHIANS 7: 1
Ques. What is the thought in the heart being expanded?
C.A.C. I suppose the apostle had been under a certain restraint when writing his first epistle. The conditions at Corinth did not tend to give him liberty; but now his letter had taken effect, he was at liberty to open his heart freely to them.
Ques. "Let *your* heart ... expand itself", and "Come out ..., and be separated"; are these two different thoughts?
C.A.C. They would be expanded by being more separate. True expansion of heart will only be found in the path of separation.
Rem. In the first epistle he calls them "babes"; here he says, "children".
C.A.C. He had to tell them in the first epistle they were babes. They had not grown up in Christ, therefore they had not much capacity to take in spiritual thoughts. He could not speak to them of the things that were so precious to his own heart. "Children" was a suitable term of endearment for them; they *were* his children.
Ques. Why does he say, "our heart", and "*your* heart" in the singular number in verses 11 and 13?
C.A.C. I think he is looking at them collectively. It was a general matter, and they were straitened because they were keeping up links with the world really.
Rem. Things are put in very strong contrast here. Our tendency is to water things down in all directions.
C.A.C. Quite so, righteousness and lawlessness cannot possibly go together, nor can light and darkness. It is an impossibility!
Rem. It is remarkable that separation or division is the first principle that God works upon (cf. @Genesis 1).
C.A.C. Yes, it is the first principle of God's ways; it is
{228}
the first principle of spiritual enlargement that we learn to see the difference between light and darkness.
Rem. There is to be no blending of the two.
C.A.C. Satan is always working on the principle of mixture, he is always trying to bring about a mixture. God hates mixtures.
With God it is to be one thing or another, and Paul insists that the Corinthians are the living God's temple. Well, if *you are* that, be true to it!
And this great thought is to be much before us, that God had said, "I will dwell among them, and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be to me a people" -- that the saints are really the holy places where God dwells and where He walks, where His movements are known.
Rem. It is very touching that God condescends to walk with His people, as it says He did in the wilderness. This, I suppose, is a provisional thing as it is here in the wilderness.
Ques. I suppose it is the most wonderful thing to think of at the present time?
C.A.C. Yes, if we realised that, we should want to be exceedingly separate from everything with the character of darkness or unrighteousness. It is striking how, in both the first and the second epistles, he holds the people of God to what they are. He does not say, You *ought* to be God's temple, but, *You are*; therefore be consistent with it. It ought to be a great matter to us that God has a dwelling-place here on earth, where He moves, and where He discloses Himself in wonderful movements of grace and love and blessing and, of course, holiness.
We need, too, to keep in mind that God wants to receive us as having entered into His own great thoughts; so that He can receive us as intelligently in the place where He has put us. He would take on that character of Father practically with us. 'If you suffer from the world's hatred or opposition, I will be a Father to you'; and if so, it does not
{229}
matter what happens to us outwardly.
Ques. Why is the title, "Lord Almighty" used?
C.A.C. Because He is looking at the saints as here on earth. He says, 'I will be everything to you that I was to My earthly people of old'.
Ques. Is there a difference between "separate" and "separated"?
C.A.C. "Separated" is the thing completed, as it says of the Lord that He was "separated from sinners" -- not simply separate, but *separated*. God has great pleasure in a people who are satisfied with Himself and who do not want that system where everything is opposed to God.
Rem. It would involve holiness.
C.A.C. That would be bound up in the thought of God's temple. There is nothing so holy as what is connected with God's temple. Though no respect is due to any building, respect is due to the saints. You cannot think of anything stagnant where God is. Our tendency is to drop down to a certain religious routine. "The living God", and God moving, suggests activity. So when we come together we expect to get something in a new way, something we have not had before. @Numbers 6 speaks of contact with a dead person.
Ques. How might we be touching what is unclean?
C.A.C. It needs constant exercise, and we have to recognise the utter evil of the man in the flesh. His world is utterly evil. Men talk of a new world, but it is a new world without Christ! Such a thing is abhorrent to every saint, so the thought of it is unclean. The thought of securing better conditions in the world without Christ is an unclean thought, and is doomed to bitter disappointment.
The thing is to be set to experience what God can be to His people in the midst of the very condition of things brought in by sin. What can God be to us as His sons and daughters, while *nothing* is changed in the scene around us, when everything goes on just the same? What can *God* be
{230}
to us? It calls for separation and for holiness. So that this self-purifying is to go on continually, and the perfecting of holiness in God's fear. It is a continually progressive thing.
The apostle was anxious that there should be more space for God to walk in at Corinth. Wherever there is room made for God, He will take it. Wherever there is a holy place -- a suitable place -- for God, He will take it; and saints will experience this just in proportion as they are separated from a fallen world and fallen man.
Nothing will satisfy God but that His sons and daughters shall partake of His own character. How wonderful to think of becoming more like God every day! That is, things we did last year, we cannot possibly think of doing today, we dare not. As we take on more of God's character we become expressive of it, so that God can recognise us as sons and daughters in this world, taking on more of His character every day.
Ques. Is @John 17: 17, "Sanctify them by the truth", a parallel thought?
C.A.C. Yes, it is wonderful the place that the saints have in God's thoughts. They are left in this world in Christ's place, and they have Christ's place before the Father. Of course God's things are continuous in being worked out. He will chasten His children until they *are* like Himself and take on His blessed character of holiness. It has been said that righteousness judges evil with authority, but holiness shrinks from evil and repels it by its own character.
Ques. Would righteousness be seen more at the cross and holiness at Gethsemane?
C.A.C. Gethsemane is a most wonderful theme, in a sense more wonderful for us to apprehend than the cross, because it is the Son going with the Father anticipatively. I think there it is more holiness; that is, the sense pressing on His holy soul of what was involved in all that necessitated the drinking of the cup -- the shrinking from it in His holy
{231}
soul. It is remarkable that it is the only time He uses that unique term of endearment, "Abba, Father". Gethsemane is a most wonderful study for the hearts of the saints. He went through it all in spirit beforehand and all in communion with His Father. I think holiness was perhaps the more distinctive feature there. Then the Father's will must prevail, and, at whatever cost, He *wishes* the Father's will should prevail. Well, that is a very holy feeling; it brings out the holy sensibilities of His soul. We belong to the One who has gone through all that in the agony of His soul, not only drinking the cup of judgment, but before drinking it, He has gone through it all in communion with His Father.
Ques. Is that why "spirit" is brought in here (chapter 7: 1)?
C.A.C. The spirit is very important, because the pollutions of the spirit are more evil than the pollutions of the flesh, because they work inwardly. The gratifications of the flesh work outwardly, but the pollutions of the spirit work inwardly -- something working in a man's spirit that is offensive to God. In @Hebrews 12: 9 it says, "Be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live". The Father is the Father of spirits, and we should remember He is concerned about our spirits -- what we are inwardly. The pollutions of the spirit are to be cleansed. I might be a decent man outwardly, but thoroughly polluted inwardly. There were certain men at Corinth wishing for a place or to be leaders among the saints. Well, that is a pollution of spirit; there might be no pollution of the flesh exactly. I suppose it is the deepest exercise of our souls to keep our spirits pure, so that in our inward exercises we are purifying our spirits and perfecting holiness in the fear of God all the time.
Rem. We only discover our motives as getting near to God.
C.A.C. That is very true. It should be a great exercise with us that we want more of God. We want Him to come
{232}
in and really have the place in our hearts affections that is due to Him. And when that takes place we find out all the things that work against Him.
Paul shows, in the chapter that follows, his intense affection for his Corinthian children. He wanted them for himself, but he wanted them for God first.
Rem. "Ye are in our hearts, to die together, and live together".
C.A.C. And is it not remarkable that he says, "Die together, and live together"? We should not naturally put it in that way. Is it not because morally we shall only live together as we die together?
Ques. It is a spiritual matter, you mean?
C.A.C. Yes. The apostle was clearly on the line of dying, "dying, and behold, we live"; and death always comes first spiritually, and particularly in christianity. He was governed by the thought of dying out of the world so as to live with Christ. So the saints, if they would be in companionship with Paul, must die with Paul, so that they might live with Paul.
Rem. The apostle was the great exemplification of what he ministered.
C.A.C. He saw a little bit of movement in them, and it was sufficient to make his heart leap with joy. And we may have the same joy when we see the same thing; we can have profound joy.
{233}
"BE NOT DIVERSELY YOKED WITH UNBELIEVERS"
@2 Corinthians 6: 14
In Proverbs, wisdom and folly are contrasted. You could not fancy wisdom and folly yoked together. If saints do not separate from the unconverted the result is disastrous. Separation is the witness of the power of God. If Christians only remembered what persons they are, not what they ought to be, they could not associate and be yoked with unbelievers. We have nothing in common with the world morally; its joys and interests are not ours.
If I make a companion of an unconverted man, how can we go on together? The things that are so precious to me, filling my heart with divine light, are actually repulsive to him. I am beholding the glory of the Lord and he is beholding the glory of man. There is no spiritual prosperity if there is not a break in friendship with unconverted people. God says, "Come out". It is very important too not to be in partnership with the unconverted. I think we ought to test all our companionships by whether there is a real desire after Christ. We ought not to make companions otherwise. If I make a friend of one not the Lord's, it is a yoke. You cannot of course break ties of relationships; you have to be prepared to part company with such.
The first division amongst brethren was between Abraham and Lot; one liked to live on the hilltop with God, and the other down on the plains. It is better to part company than to go with those in the world.
Then we should come out with dignity, "For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go out by flight; for Jehovah will go before you, and the God of Israel will be your rear-guard" (@Isaiah 52: 12). One sometimes sees people sneak out, that is to try to avoid their old companions. No, that will not do! Tell them about it. You go out with a high hand; you go out
{234}
with a sense that God is before you and behind you; you are not afraid of anybody, and you are not afraid of the consequences. You go out with dignity.
If we need extra care we shall get it. The daughters represent the weaker side. If there is special need there will be special care. It is well to come under the grace of it. This is parental care. We leave the resources of Egypt, but then we find God.
There is the persecution side undoubtedly, but it is all gain, for you begin to prove for the first time that God is a reality. No young believer finds his feet until he has proved God for himself. The Lord says, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God ..." (@Matthew 6: 33). If you are on that line you are set to prove how He can preserve and keep you. No Christian makes any progress if he does not act on the principle of verse 17. We all had links and we had to break them and come out, and made no start until we did. It is that I had to move, but God moves in me.
{235}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CORINTHIANS 7: 1 - 16
C.A.C. "Pollution of flesh and spirit" (verse 1); both were at Corinth, flesh gross outwardly, pollution of spirit in divine things, self-confidence, vain-glory; there were gross and refined things; also pollution of spirit -- anything allowed in spirit, what one entertains inwardly, anything unworthy of God is really a pollution in those who form God's temple. The fact of being God's temple makes the necessity of separation and holiness very great. The absence of the fear of God is the root of almost every kind of evil; there is a great lack of it today. It has almost become characteristic of the christian profession at large, "There is no fear of God before their eyes" (@Romans 3: 18). I suppose we have now to distinguish between righteousness and lawlessness in the christian sphere; it was not so in early days. When the apostle writes in chapter 6: 14, lawlessness was the state of the world around. Today we have to do with it within, then it was without.
Ques. Do you think saints do not realise their responsibility?
C.A.C. The secret of all is that we do not know the grace of God, we are not established in grace, and there is room for the world when the heart is not kept in grace.
Ques. Does indifference indicate a want of preparedness of heart?
C.A.C. "An honest and good heart" (@Luke 8: 15) I suppose would be where the fear of God was. It is practical, there are certain things that pollute that have to be put aside; they do not always just drop off. I think God puts His finger on things that are hindrances; we may go on for years, but a time comes when God puts His finger on a thing; it may be through ministry, or prayer, and waiting on Him. God gives no more light, if light from Him is refused.
{236}
It is a very serious thing to refuse light from God, should it be in the character of the light which either exposes something in me, or opens up something in Him; serious consequences follow if Christians refuse light -- they get left behind. J.B.S. used to say that discipline comes for correction when people want to go right -- God comes in to help them. God may come in and deal with you so that you could not go on with the thing. A conscience is kept tender by always listening; if we refuse to hearken, it is surprising how quickly the conscience gets callous. Then God comes in and quickens the conscience again, as we see in this epistle; it is very encouraging to see that God can come in and restore things and put things on a footing more suitable to Himself.
The apostle does not seem to have the thought of perfection this side of glory; there is such a thing as entire sanctification though; the apostle prayed that the whole spirit, soul and body may be "preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ" (@1 Thessalonians 5: 23). A saint needs conversion very often, a turn round. God allows many a thing to arise to exercise His people generally. All the trouble at Corinth, and the necessity of dealing with evil, was quite abnormal, but all for their spiritual profit.
God intended they should be exercised by it, that they might come into exercise before God. It is very much the same amongst Christians today. The occasion of sorrow and trial is the voice of the Lord, not by chance or the folly of believers, but we ought to hear the Lord's voice. The Lord has a voice in it. It is only by walking with God that we grow in holiness; it is then very serious that when things arise God means to teach us something; we may have been going on carelessly and run up against some block in the road. We need to be exercised about things. The exercise passed through at Corinth resulted in their understanding the character of God's house, and their behaviour in that house, more than they ever did before. So that when evil
{237}
comes into the assembly it is not all unmixed evil. God uses it for the instruction of His saints.
Rem. The cover of the tabernacle was badger skins to repel evil.
C.A.C. Yes, it is very much what salt is a figure of; it is that savour of God that preserves from the corrupting influences of evil, and what enables one to cut off a right hand, or pluck out a right eye if found to be an offence. The Holy Spirit is a Holy Spirit, we must ever remember that. The moment evil touches the soul, it is a very blessed thing if there is self-judgment at once, it does not then go any further.
How the apostle lets himself out is very lovely. He exposes his own weakness to them; he tells them he regretted writing that letter to them. It was really the love of Christ in the apostle. It is very edifying to see it in that light -- the love of Christ in a vessel characterised by weakness. He was so distressed, that he had no rest in his spirit. It is never happy when saints have to be grieved, and it is no pleasure to the Lord, but a necessity that they should be grieved according to God. The thought of a breach between him and the saints was intolerable, and it should be today if there is any affection for the people of God.
{238}
SUMMARY OF A READING @2 CORINTHIANS 8: 1 - 24
The subject of giving occupies such a large place because it is the practical exhibition of the truth of the one body. It was of great satisfaction to the apostle that the Gentiles ministered to the poor Jews -- it showed a practical binding together. He had besought them not to receive the grace of God in vain, and had said also, "Corinthians, our heart is expanded ..., let your heart also expand itself" (chapter 6: 11, 13), and now he could speak of the grace that had shown itself in a very practical way. It is the character of God coming out in the saints. God's character is that of a giver. If you can become poor even in money to the enriching of others it seems to me it is on the line of what God is and of what Christ is (see verse 9). That makes the subject important.
God is bringing out His own testimony in men "for glory to God by us" (chapter 1: 20); and there is a circle where divine affections can have their outflow; the saints were not to be narrowed up to themselves, but to widen out to other saints -- the wide circle of Christ's interests. There are two sides of expansion. First, separation from what is outside, and then, inside, the outflow of grace and liberality. I do not think the apostle was anxious as to himself; even with the Philippians, he desired that fruit might abound to their account. The two things that characterise the saints are separation from the world which rejected Christ, and then their love for one another; they are bound together in holy love. Separation in itself would be a poor, cold thing; there must be these exercises of divine affections. We need to have the practical character of christianity before us, for we are in danger of being theoretical. This is a remarkable bringing together of things in verse 2: trial of affliction, abundance of joy, deep poverty, riches of liberality; you
{239}
could scarcely have a mixture of greater contrasts. In early days, the light of God's grace was in every heart; there was the simplicity of fellowship and all was brought into the assembly. They brought their money and "laid it at the feet of the apostles". The widow's offering of two mites surpassed even the offerings of Solomon. The tendency of many things is to dry us up and to make us suspicious. We have to guard against it. The widespread character of evil tends to make us suspicious, and we have to mind that that sort of feeling does not have the upper hand with us. The basic thing for us is that we should hold everything as the Lord's. These Macedonians first gave themselves to the Lord and in doing so they gave everything. We give and the Lord accepts, "according to what he may have". He knows what we have and accepts the gift accordingly.
It is not God's mind that among His people there should be some rolling in wealth while others are starving in poverty, but that there might be equality (verse 14). In verse 9 Paul gives a tremendous incentive, and ends (chapter 9: 15) with "Thanks be to God for his unspeakable free gift". It is a question with him of behaving as divine Persons had behaved.
{240}
ESPOUSED UNTO ONE MAN
@2 Corinthians 11: 2
When the servants of the Lord have to do anything which looks like vindicating themselves they always feel foolish in doing it, though it may be forced upon them by the conduct of others. Paul's only reason for doing it was his jealousy on God's part. He did not want the Corinthians for himself but for Christ; he had espoused them to one Man. It was in his mind in all his labour that the Corinthian assembly should be uncorrupted in virgin affections for Christ. He does not regard them as married, but espoused; their thoughts needed to be kept in simplicity as to the Christ. The serpent deceived Eve by his craft; he diverted her attention from the tree and from the will of God. Simplicity as to the Christ is what should mark each local assembly as an espoused virgin.
There can be no doubt that Paul had given the Corinthians a very distinct impression that they were to be for Christ in an affectionate way. There is nothing more delightful than to see this taking form in young believers -- every presentation of Christ laying hold of the heart and displacing what is of the flesh and the world. Paul's presentation of Christ to them was his espousing them to Christ. It is well that this should be always in our minds in any service: it is to be such a presentation of Christ that those who come under its power will not think of any other. It was the present result for which Paul laboured; he desired to present them to Christ as those whose thoughts were filled with Him through the ministry. Now this is just what Satan would seek to counteract. We have to do with a crafty deceiver whose object is to introduce something to our thoughts which is not the one Man. See @Romans 5: 15.
Philip at Samaria, and the whole of the Acts, show how the one Man was presented. God has nothing for men
{241}
outside that one Man, and he is putting right thoughts of Him in men by the glad tidings so that there might be in every place a company of persons who are espoused to Him in chaste virgin character, who want nothing but Christ and refuse what is not Christ, however good and nice it may seem to be. Men at Corinth had transformed themselves into apostles of Christ -- they had that appearance, but there was no truth in it; they were Satan's ministers. No doubt they used Christ's name, and said many things which in themselves seemed to be right, but there was no presentation of Christ as the one Man. Had they brought anything better than Paul? Another Jesus, or a different Spirit, or a different glad tidings? They might well bear with it if they had now got something better than Paul had given them. But it was far otherwise.
Presenting as a chaste virgin to Christ is not a future thing. It is the satisfaction which the faithful minister of Christ cherishes, that there should be a local company, free from corrupting influences, for the eye of Christ to rest upon with pleasure now as answering to His thought. It is the present moral result of the ministry of Christ. We receive Him into our thoughts through the ministry. "In teaching uncorruptedness" (@Titus 2: 7) shows that no element of defect is to be present in what is set before the saints.
{242}
"A MAN IN CHRIST"
@2 Corinthians 12: 1
The way Paul speaks of himself as "a man in Christ" is most instructive, for it shows how a saint can be abstracted in his mind from everything that he is naturally, and can be conscious of what he is as in Christ without anything else being present to his consciousness for a certain period of time, his body even being no hindrance, for he was not conscious of his body at all; he did not know whether he was in it or out of it. Paul was, for the time, taken out of his responsible existence, but not taken out of the consciousness of being in Christ. As having this consciousness he was caught up to the third heaven, which in itself is deeply interesting as showing that there are three heavens. The tabernacle was the representation and shadow of heavenly things, the figurative representation of things in the heavens, and it had three distinct parts. Our great High Priest has passed through the heavens. These are the heavens of @Genesis 1 where the sun, moon and stars are set, and there is a heaven where the sun, moon and stars are set, and there is a heaven where angels are, both good and evil, and from which Satan will be cast out. Then there is a third heaven where the immediate presence of God is, and that is the place which God has prepared for man in Christ.
As far as the third heaven -- we never read of a fourth heaven. It is where Christ is, and a man in Christ can be caught up there. He is equal to that elevation. A man blessed with every spiritual blessing in Christ is as suited to the third heaven as Christ is. Then Paul was also caught up into paradise. The word means, I believe, a garden of delight, and I think it has reference to God's delight in Man. It is because the Son of God is there as Man that it is paradise. Paul was caught up into it; he was brought in a miraculous way into the very inner region of divine delight.
{243}
And there he heard unspeakable things said. Who said them? We cannot doubt, from verse 1, that it was the Lord. If we were entirely abstracted from all that belongs to the natural, and only conscious of being "in Christ", what wonderful things we should be capable of hearing! Such is the state of those who are with Christ.
But we need to go back and enquire from Scripture how we come to be "in Christ". First of all, I apprehend, it is through redemption (@Romans 3: 24). Sinful creatures are justified, righteously cleared of every charge, but they are justified in Christ. How I am cleared I have to see in another Man raised from among the dead; hence it is by faith. Redemption shows that full value has been paid, on the ground of which God can justify, but it is known to faith alone.
Then as to life we are to reckon ourselves alive to God in the One who lives to God. I live to God as in Christ, and in no other way. But then this requires a work of God in me, and we read in @1 Corinthians 1: 30 that it is "of him" that we are in Christ Jesus, who is made so wondrous as our all.
We have just to pursue the knowledge of Christ. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus for liberty.

EPISTLE TO THE GALATIANS
{246}
{247}
NOTES OF A READING @GALATIANS 1: 1 - 24
C.A.C. The apostle seems to write with a greater anxiety and severity to the Galatians than he did to the Corinthians. He tells them that if the line they were on was the right one, Christ had died for nothing. He has to vindicate the divine commission that he held (verse 1) which did not come through man, he did not get his commission through the twelve. We have not got the gospel directly from the Lord, nor from God the Father; we have got it mediately; Paul got it immediately. We owe it all to Paul, for he is in a special way our apostle. What was put into Paul was put there that it might be preached to the nations, the Son of God revealed in the affections of a man, so that that man might become the vessel of the ministry of the Son of God to the nations. If we have not got the gospel from Paul we have not got it at all; no one else has it: it comes that way, and it has pleased God that it should -- He separated Paul from the outset and called him by His grace. It pleased God to reveal His Son in Paul so that Paul might preach Him in the glad tidings. Paul says in another place, "My glad tidings" (@2 Timothy 2: 8) -- he is able to appropriate personally as his own peculiar mission and treasure "my glad tidings". He begins at the outset by preaching Christ, that He is the Son of God: it is a Man in the very supreme place of love and favour with God. The Son of God is the glorified Man in heaven, a Man in the supreme place of heavenly favour, divine affections and acceptance with God: it is a Man there who is preached as glad tidings; that is God's mind for men, and nothing less. All is set forth in a heavenly, glorified Son of God. It pleased God that there should be a new commission from heaven. The twelve had their commission on earth, which compared with the days of the Lord Jesus in His flesh, resurrection and life on earth; but
{248}
then, if one may so say, Paul compared with Him as a glorified Man in heaven. Paul's knowledge of Christ is not after the flesh or in resurrection, but his knowledge of Him is as a glorified Man in heaven.
Ques. Was Paul's evidence greater than that of the disciples?
C.A.C. Yes, "Last of all, as to an abortion, he appeared to *me* also" (@1 Corinthians 15: 8). He was seen as a glorified Man in heaven, all that transcendent light above the brightness of the midday sun, shining in a glorified Man in heaven, all the effulgence of God in His beloved Son. I think the whole truth of the assembly is involved in it. "Why dost thou persecute me?" -- those on earth were carrying the features of the heavenly Man, and Paul was persecuting them -- the whole truth of the assembly was wrapped up in that pronoun "me".
Ques. How would you distinguish between a glorified Man in heaven and a Man in resurrection?
C.A.C. A Man in resurrection stands in relation to all the previous history of man as on the earth; that is, man has been on earth and come under sin and death, but there is another Man who has been made sin and has gone into death, and by the grace of God that Man is seen in resurrection on earth. Resurrection stands in reference to what man is brought out of, the bringing out from that state of death which man has come under. Resurrection is in relation to the former history of man, which is taken up by Christ and God glorified as to it. A risen Christ is the evidence that everything is cleared; He has passed out of the scene of death in resurrection in perfect suitability for God's world.
A glorified Christ in heaven stands in reference to the eternal purpose of God: the eternal purpose of God is to have a Man in heaven, who is morally worthy to be there. He has been in the place of humiliation, and has so glorified God in the question of sin and in victory over
{249}
death, and so met the power of the enemy, that He is worthy to achieve the supreme place. All the purpose of God centres in Him; before the world began it was the purpose of God to have a Man in heaven, and the gospel as unfolded in this epistle is the gospel of divine purpose: it is connected with the Son of God, completely outside all the ruined state of man. Paul was set apart in the purpose of God from his birth: "Who set me apart even from my mother's womb" (verse 15). He was not converted for many a year. This shows how on the side of purpose, before Paul had any history of responsibility, he was set apart; it is entirely connected with purpose. I am afraid there is very little preached of the gospel on the line of Galatians. Most preachings are to show how the ruin of man has been met by divine remedy: it is very blessed and needful, but it is not Paul's gospel. It is very important and necessary to see that if man is not brought to repentance -- Paul insists on that -- if man is not brought to judge himself, he will not move on to the ground of a glorified Man in heaven. No man had ever such a profound sense of his own utter ruin as Paul had. He was a man of a good conscience, he had never done a wrong thing as far as his conscience went -- he was a model man, and yet he was the worst man that ever lived, because he hated Christ with a more intense hatred than any other man. He was led by the Spirit to see himself as the chief of sinners, the first man in that army. There was not much reputation in being the chief of sinners: he found what a desperate state it was possible for the human heart to get into, that it should be filled with hatred to Christ.
Ques. Was not Paul a specially prepared vessel?
C.A.C. Yes, every minute of Saul's life he was under the eye of the purpose of God, and every one of God's elect is under the eye of God's purpose from the moment they enter the world. God sovereignly overrules things; the place where we are born, the family into which we are born, the influences under which we come, our education, our
{250}
profession or trade etc., God's sovereignty takes it all into account, and so orders it that it may bring us into the way and spot of blessing and to the Man of blessing. Paul tells the Romans that he was separated to the gospel of God concerning His Son, he was separated to it, he was a gospel Nazarite, he had nothing to do with anything else. The most blessed thing in regard of our responsible history is that it is connected with divine sovereignty, and divine sovereignty has its way with us in connection with the life of responsibility; it lies behind things and moulds and orders them from the outset. Paul had no exercise when he was born, but he was separated, set apart from his birth. The Lord said, "I have other sheep which are not of this fold" (@John 10: 16), and 'I want all of them converted'. Some of them are sitting in this room tonight, Christ possesses them. He said also to Paul of Corinth, "I have much people in this city" (@Acts 18: 10) -- no one was converted there yet, but He says, "I have much people in this city". Paul was set apart, not only for his personal blessing but as the vessel of the glad tidings, so the Lord says to Ananias, "Go, for this man is an elect vessel to me" (@Acts 9: 15).
Ques. Are we not all special vessels?
C.A.C. Yes, for the blessing of the gospel, but we are not all apostles. I think Paul's service was only connected with time, and with the place he would have in the world to come, but his eternal place in sonship we share with him. We are delivered from this present evil world and linked up with a glorified Man in heaven. There are two worlds: the present world and the world of purpose, and we are being taken out of one and set in another by divine sovereignty.
Ques. How does that work out now?
C.A.C. Every question is settled in regard to our sins: "Who gave himself for our sins, so that he should deliver us out of the present evil world" (verse 4).
Ques. "Many are called ones, but few chosen ones" (@Matthew 22: 14). Is it special to be chosen or are all chosen?
{251}
C.A.C. Do you not think that that brings in a different thought from the thought of sovereignty which we have been speaking of? It brings in the thought of being chosen because of divine complacency. There is a sovereign choice; when the Lord said, "An elect vessel to me", that is a sovereign choice, Paul had been divinely and sovereignly chosen. But when He says, "Many are called ones, but few chosen ones", that is rather the choice of selection: God is selecting those whom He can approve. In regard of Christ, He is the Elect of God, that is not sovereign; He is the Elect of God because there is everything in Him which God could delight in. God chooses Him because there is everything there which is complacent to Him. "Chosen us in Him before the world's foundation" (@Ephesians 1: 4) is sovereign, but here (@Matthew 22) we come into view as the elect of God having character which God can approve. It was said of Christ, "I have exalted one chosen out of the people" (@Psalm 89: 19) -- God looks over all the people and picks out Christ and says, 'This is the One I delight in'.
Ques. Are verses 15 and 16 for every believer, or specially to Paul?
C.A.C. I thought they were specially in relation to Paul; he brings it in as vindicating his ministry and the divine character of it, which he has not got through any human channel. Paul got his gospel through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised Him from the dead: it came straight from divine Persons.
It is nice to see that Paul had many brethren with him, "All the brethren with me" (verse 2). He seems to delight to link others with himself: in other epistles it is Timothy, Sosthenes, or Silvanus, but here it is all the brethren: I think it was to show the importance of the question, that he had all the brethren with him. All those with him were in perfect accord with what he was writing; it gave him pleasure to link all the brethren with him; he does not move without the brethren.
{252}
If an evil principle is introduced it is likely to spread, not only locally but districtwise. Paul wonders that they should be so quickly changed (verse 6). It is a very solemn thing to find how quickly we can change.
Ques. In what way does legality come in here?
C.A.C. In giving some place to the flesh in what might be called the good side. They were going back to the law and circumcision, observing days and all that kind of thing. It all belongs to the present age: if I am under the law I am living in the present age. They are weak and beggarly elements because they produce nothing for God.
It was pointed out at the commencement that God had called them in the grace of Christ to the place that Christ has before Him, but they turned aside to another gospel; they quickly changed from all that, though they did not realise it until they got this letter. They probably had no idea that there had been any change at all, and it probably startled them when they read this epistle and found Paul wondering why they had so quickly changed. The ministry of the word produces exercise, and calls our attention to things that we should never have noticed if left to ourselves. If we were left to our own exercises we might drift a long way without noticing, but the ministry of the word pulls us up and shows where we are getting to. They had moved away from God and moved away from the holy calling of God. "Who has bewitched you?" (@Galatians 3: 1). It shows the instability of man when left to himself, he is nothing but instability.
Ques. How do works come in here?
C.A.C. It appears that the works of the law and those things which had place in judaism had been brought into christianity to spoil it. The devil always takes up what God has laid aside, and he was very quick to bring in legal elements and works of the law such as observance of days, being circumcised, and all that kind of thing, which can be taken up by man after the flesh.
{253}
Ques. Are we in danger of allowing anything like that?
C.A.C. I think we are always in danger of legality in some form or other; the pendulum swings from one side to the other, a man is carnal at one time and legal at another. The great thing is to be kept spiritual, and then we shall not swing either side. If we walk in the Spirit we shall not be carnal or legal: we shall not be indulging the carnality of the flesh, or seeking to promote the legality of it.
Ques. What form does legality take with us?
C.A.C. I think we are much in danger of taking up the position of men in the flesh, and wanting some kind of recognition or place as in that order.
Ques. Why does he bring in the thought of angels from heaven (verse 8)?
C.A.C. Nothing was to be accepted from whatever quarter it might come, even from an angel from heaven. "If even *we*" -- that is a fine touch. We have to see that we do not allow anyone to trouble us and pervert the glad tidings of the Christ. It is easy to see how they have been perverted in the whole of christendom, all kinds of legal elements have been brought in and are applied to man in the flesh, and the glad tidings of the Christ are perverted. We have all been involved in that kind of thing, and we have to see now that we are clear of it; we have to get free in our own spirits from influences of that kind, and come back to the joy and blessing of Paul's gospel. The legal principle brings people into bondage: I should say that if a person is in bondage it shows that he is legal. The general tendency today is more to the Corinthian error, a laxity and looseness about things, self-indulgence and all that, but legality brings people into bondage and results in the works of the flesh coming out. The Corinthian says, "Let us eat and drink; for to-morrow we die" (@1 Corinthians 15: 32), but the Galatian says, 'I will not do that and then I shall be a good man'.

EPISTLE TO THE EPHESIANS
{256}
{257}
THE EPISTLE TO THE EPHESIANS
Though addressed to saints in Ephesus, there is nothing in the epistle to localise it, save that Gentiles are particularly in the mind of the writer. It was probably carried by Tychicus at the same time as he brought the epistle to the Colossians, but was intended to set forth the whole counsel of God in its bearing on saints from among the Gentiles, so that it has a very general character. The opening of the epistle makes this clear.
The blessing now is spiritual and it is heavenly. What is spiritual connects with the fact that God is a Spirit, and also with the fact that there are those who are born of the Spirit and indwelt by the Spirit. Such have capacity for what is spiritual. Then blessings are heavenly because Christ is in heaven and they are in Him who is there. And what is there is linked on with God's eternal purpose in Christ. In purpose He was viewed as Man, and the saints were chosen in Him. There was the thought in the mind of God before the first man existed of men being blessed in Christ and brought into accord with God in nature. "Holy and blameless before him in love" is a nature suitable to God. This comes first; the position and dignity in which God may set us comes second. Sonship through Jesus Christ shows the speciality and distinction which it suits the good pleasure of God's will to confer upon His saints. It is the glory of His grace -- the transcendent excellence of it. It is "in the Beloved"; that is, in Christ as in heaven, glorified. It is sonship suitable to heaven and to the love which rests upon Christ there. The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ chose that it should be so: all His saints are in that favour. We find the expression repeatedly, "To the praise", showing that the end in view is that saints of the assembly should take up the glory of grace in their praises.
{258}
As far as our side is concerned, we need redemption, which settles every moral question -- the riches of God's grace coming out in the forgiveness of offences. Whatever offences there had been, they are forgiven; they become an occasion for love according to verse 7 -- "Through his blood". It is forgiveness on the ground that the life of Christ here has been poured out that we might be with God in the value of it and in this way know the riches of His grace, so that in spite of our past we can share with Christ in the inheritance, which is all that comes unto us to the praise of God's glory. He has marked us out for inheritance, and this calls for intelligence as to administration.
Gentiles had trusted, or hoped, in Christ, "having heard the word of the truth, the glad tidings of your salvation". It is by hearing the word of the truth that we are brought to trust in Christ; it is all about Him. He is the subject of all Scripture, the fulfilment and the Fulfiller of all promises; One mighty enough to crush the head of "the ancient serpent", the devil, the corrupter and deceiver of the human race; One able to express as Man here all that God was in compassion and kindness to His fallen creature; and One who could give Himself a ransom for all, and be made sin upon the cross so that God might be glorified by His suffering what was due to that dreadful thing, sin, which had come into God's universe; One now raised from among the dead and glorified so that He sits as a glorified Man at the right hand of God.
Now all this is "the word of the truth" which God is causing men to hear. It is the truth, whether men believe it or not. But if any believe it, most wonderful light as to God comes into their hearts. They learn God's character and disposition manward; it is told out perfectly in Christ, who has gone down lower than any of us that we might be brought up from sin and death and Satan's power, and become the eternal expression of what God's grace and kindness delight to do for those who have sunk to the
{259}
lowest point through departure from Him. So that the word of the truth is the glad tidings of our salvation. For no man can say, Christ is not for me. He is preached that all men may know that He is for them. And if Christ is for me as the expression of what God has in His mind and heart for me, and I believe it, I am at once made supremely happy. Christ is salvation for me on God's part; I can lay myself out to learn how great He is as eternally divine, and how He has descended to become Man, and then to the death of the cross, and that He is now glorified. It all enters into what He is as salvation for me. Could I desire anything more or greater? He has been found in every place from eternal Godhead to the dust of death, and now He has gone from the dust of death to the highest point in the universe, and in Him we see that divine glory is the measure of divine grace. He is God's salvation for us in every way, and in every position. Is He not in every way trustworthy? The light of who He is brings about that we trust in Him. And those who trust in Him are saved by grace and have the certainty of being glorified and sharing His inheritance with Him.
But there is another most wonderful thing. "In whom also, having believed, ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise". As in Christ we are sealed: God claims us as His own; we are marked off in an unmistakable way under His eye. And the word "promise" connects this great favour specially with the Father. For the Lord said, "I send the promise of my Father upon you" (@Luke 24: 49). See also @Acts 1: 4. It is said of the Son of man that the Father has sealed Him. The sealing in His case was the expression of the Father's delight in Him as the Son of man. But the great matter of "promise" while the Son was here was that the Holy Spirit should be upon men as the seal of the Father's pleasure in them as in Christ. The thought originated with the Father; the "promise" was made in view of the gratification of His own heart. No human mind
{260}
would ever have thought of such favour from God. When the believer is sealed in Christ it is as though God said to him, 'I am very pleased with you, because you have entered into what was in My mind and heart for you, as set forth in My glorified Son'. The Holy Spirit is the seal of this -- the attestation of it -- to the believer.
{261}
NOTES OF A READING @EPHESIANS 1: 1 - 14
C.A.C. Why was this subject chosen?
Rem. That our thoughts might be lifted above the pressure down here to what we have in Christ.
C.A.C. No salutation appears in this epistle, the subject is outside particular persons, and is the common portion of all saints in Christ. All are viewed according to the full thoughts of divine love and purpose.
Ques. Why does he call them faithful -- "Faithful in Christ Jesus"?
C.A.C. Faithful in the sense that they were believing ones. "They who are on the principle of faith are blessed with believing Abraham" (@Galatians 3: 9).
Believing is a great matter: to be full of faith as receiving the divine testimony. Their position in Christ Jesus is a matter of faith with them, not mere doctrine. We are "by faith in Christ Jesus" (@Galatians 3: 26). It is normal to believers. A new place in Christ Jesus is opened up to them. It would help if we took up the position; what confidence it would give in prayer and how it would help us in practical details of life. *Have* we the faith of it? It contains the thought of position and state. Both are always linked with the words "in Christ Jesus". It is a new status we have entered upon, so is characteristic of our state, for it means the position has been taken up -- it supposes it taken up, so it makes state, not merely standing. "In Christ" gives the thought of purpose only. "Faithful in Christ Jesus" is greater than being faithful. A faithful individual -- that is I, not God and His precious thoughts before me.
Rem. I disappear in Christ Jesus.
C.A.C. I pass out of myself into Christ Jesus, it is a faith state.
Ques. What is the difference between "saints" and "faithful in Christ Jesus"?
{262}
C.A.C. We are "saints" by divine calling, as called of God, just as an apostle was called. We had nothing whatever to do with it. It is by the will of God. We cannot alter it. "Faithful in Christ Jesus" means we are marked by the faith of our position in Christ Jesus. It is the basis of all our relations with God. As we pray, how the sense of it would affect us.
Rem. In Timothy "in Christ Jesus" is mentioned many times over in relation to the saints, showing the need of their being established in the new position in the last days.
C.A.C. We need the faith of our new position. It is our abiding place with God. "In Christ Jesus" is a complete change of status, outside all status in the flesh as a worthless and discarded thing. It belongs to me, and why should I not have the comfort of it?
"In Christ Jesus" does not only refer to Him personally, but is an extended thought great enough to admit all saints. It is a suitable introduction to this epistle. If it is our state, where can we not go? We have not only the freedom down here, but the freedom of the heavenlies.
Verses 3 - 14 are all one sentence without a stop. All is an utterance of worship -- a sample of how Paul would take part in the assembly when amongst spiritual conditions in Ephesus. He worships before he prays. He worships, then he prays that they may enter into it. We might well do this, and in private prayer. It would probably prevent our praying afterwards for things we should not have asked for! There is very little about worship in the New Testament so we must pick up what we can. Worship cannot go beyond where the meeting is, or it tends to be unreal, but it is always possible to bring God's great thoughts before Him. Here we see the apostle worshipping -- you cannot say 'I' or 'me' then. This is a model for assembly worship, every sentence grows up out of the previous one -- it develops as it proceeds, and all is addressed to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. It gives an idea of how our new
{263}
position works out Godward. The apostle could say all this with one breath, but we cannot. A spirit of worship is the right introduction to this epistle or we shall lose the value, power and glory of it.
'God' is in relation to the blessed and exalted Man. 'God' is a greater thought than 'the Father'.
Ques. As to "Grace to you and peace from God our Father" -- peace for what?
C.A.C. Peace for pressure down here. Of this grace and peace there is a perpetual outflow; if I turn my face to God the Father this is what meets me as in this new position in Christ Jesus -- a perpetual outflow upon us, always to be known and counted upon.
Ques. What is the difference between mercy and grace?
C.A.C. It has been said that mercy is great in the need it meets, grace is great in the thought of the Person exercising it -- so grace is more purely what is in God Himself, the thought of favour in the heart of God, independent of me, though I may be the occasion of bringing this out. There is no limit to favour for the assembly: "Taken ... into favour in the Beloved".
The nearer we are the more intensely blessed is our portion. Have we got to God? "For Christ indeed has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God" (@1 Peter 3: 18). A wonderful thing it is to get to God -- no sin, no infirmity, no shade of the world or flesh there, but a spiritual realm of blessing in the heavenlies.
{264}
NOTES OF A READING @EPHESIANS 1: 9 - 14
Ques. The will of God, the purpose of God and the counsel of God, is there a definite thought connected with each?
C.A.C. It would seem that the will of God must prevail -- a great comfort. Our place of infinite favour in the Beloved is a matter of the good pleasure of His will. Is that the inner circle?
Rem. Yes, indeed. You were thinking of it in contrast later to the mystery of His will.
C.A.C. I was thinking the subject widens out as we pursue this chapter. What is for the good pleasure of His will is already brought to pass, the saints being put at the very centre of all that is the product of the will of God, and they look out to the vast scene of glory which has such a Centre.
Rem. The mystery -- to head up all things in the Christ -- is now made known.
Rem. And this is all the working out of what was in the mind of Christ when He said, "Lo, I come ... to do, O God, thy will" (@Hebrews 10: 7).
C.A.C. It all stands in the value of His Person; and what He has wrought for the glory of God all puts its measurement there -- according to the Beloved, and the ability to give effect to the will of God. So we move out to a wondrous scene in which no trace of imperfection remains.
"Which he purposed in himself". It originated in God Himself -- all these developments, all are for the satisfaction of His own heart.
C.A.C. Surely. One can see what a vast range of wisdom and intelligence is opened up: wisdom and intelligence are what God would develop in the assembly,
{265}
ability to compass His great thoughts and what He is doing for Himself.
Ques. Would counsel suggest the Persons of the Godhead in conclave in regard to what is purposed?
C.A.C. I should think so. Counsel would suggest the wisdom, if one might use the word, of God, the deliberation by which all is worked out. The purpose is the purpose of love surely, but the love works in wisdom.
Ques. Would "will" be the power to effect the purpose according to His counsel?
C.A.C. I think so; God being what He is, His will is the most blessed thing that we can think of. Saints often limit the thought of God's will to what God would have *them* do.
Rem. "That ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God" (@Romans 12: 2).
C.A.C. In giving ourselves over to God we prove that His will is extremely good and acceptable, indeed it is perfect. We do not get the comfort of it until we give ourselves over to it. But here it is the will of God embracing the universe, but connected with time.
Ques. They are operations carried out in time?
C.A.C. Yes, the reference is to time -- "the fulness of times" -- it is not eternity.
Rem. I notice the activities here are entirely God's acting: "Who works all things according to the counsel of his own will" and, "Which he purposed in himself for the administration of the fulness of times; to head up all things in the Christ".
C.A.C. Yes, quite so.
Ques. What is conveyed in the thought of "the fulness of times"?
C.A.C. Is it everything coming to maturity according to God in relation to time? In a certain sense everything came to maturity when the Son of God came in; it was the fulness of time. All was brought in that was of God and for
{266}
God, but in one Person, in view of many receiving sonship.
Ques. All that is concentrated in Christ is to be displayed; is that the idea?
C.A.C. When we get sonship we come to full maturity of what is in the mind of God.
Rem. It is "fulness of times".
C.A.C. I suppose "times" in which God has developed His mind in the actual history of the world.
Rem. His "administration of the fulness of times".
C.A.C. What do you understand by that?
Rem. What is wrought out and all headed up in Him. God has been working out something throughout all the dispensations and there will be the culmination of it.
C.A.C. Yes.
Rem. The millennium will be the fulness of times as regards the creation. Afterwards there will be the new heavens and earth.
Ques. Would @Psalm 8 be prophetic of this, everything put under the Son of man?
C.A.C. Yes, I think so.
Ques. "When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son" (@Galatians 4: 4) Would that bear on this?
C.A.C. Was not that in contrast to the previous dispensation resting on the law, when the saints were in an imperfect and immature state, and could not get beyond it? The fulness of the time is contrasted with what is imperfect. In Galatians it is clearly sonship that is in view; it is the full thought of God as mature. It is a wonderful time we live in, and presently it is going to reach out to all things in heaven and on earth; and the administration will be perfect because it centres in Christ. Men will not be perfect, but the administration will be perfect.
Rem. "The Father had given him all things into his hands" (@John 13: 3).
C.A.C. How competent He is to secure the pleasure of God in any sphere.
{267}
Rem. In your prayer in the morning you referred to sonship in relation to angels and Israel as well as ourselves.
C.A.C. Scripture shows sonship is not always on the same plane. Sonship is a great cherished thought of God, and the angels are sons of God, but they do not answer to God as the saints of the assembly do.
Rem. They must be in the same place as Christ in order to do so.
C.A.C. Israel will be in the place of sons one day, but it will not be sonship as we know it.
Ques. In what way do you distinguish it?
C.A.C. Well, I should seek to see that if a divine Person came into the place of Son, it gives an entirely new apprehension of sonship. It is a divine Person come into manhood and found in the relation of Son to God; the thought of sonship could not be entertained previously. You do not get such a thing in the book of Psalms as "Abba, Father", do you?
Rem. It is a peculiar place of blessing belonging to the saints now in a faith period.
C.A.C. It is wonderful that God waited so long before He brought in the cherished thought of His own heart -- before it was developed. His thought could not be secured in the sons of Adam.
Rem. I have been struck in reading through the Psalms, that David in the Psalms does not speak of God's love, though he says, "I will love thee".
C.A.C. Loving-kindness is the highest note you would reach in the Psalms.
Rem. 'When time had fully run its course, Thy Son came forth to make it known' (`204:1).
Ques. What is the thought of heading up all things in Christ? Is it a further thought than administration, or connected with it?
C.A.C. I think it is connected with the administration,
{268}
that God will bring everything in heaven and on the earth to find its moral centre in Christ. When God takes in hand to administer (which He is not now doing in relation to the earth certainly), it will work out in that way, so things will work out from Christ.
Rem. It will not be arbitrary, but through the attractiveness of His Person.
C.A.C. And in the fulness of times there will be no counteracting influence.
Ques. And is it that that wonderful scene, when everything is headed up in Christ, is given to us as our portion, our inheritance; is that the thought?
Rem. And sharing with Him is the thought of heirship.
C.A.C. Yes, I think God would have us sometimes to look down as well as to look up.
Ques. What do you mean by that?
C.A.C. The spirit of sonship would lead us to look up, but the spirit of heirship would lead us to look down.
Rem. So the whole scene would be under our eyes.
C.A.C. So it becomes a very real portion to us. The millennium should not be a mere abstraction to us. We are often interested in a detached way only.
Rem. "The whole creation groans together and travails in pain together until now", etc. (@Romans 8: 22).
C.A.C. In Romans the glory is brought in as adjusting everything here.
Ques. I wondered if it was like Moses on Pisgah and John on the mountain, taken to see the extent of the inheritance?
C.A.C. Yes, and I thought what is given to us in Christ as an inheritance, the whole range of what is headed up in Christ. And the Spirit being here brings it to the present time; we have not yet the inheritance, but we have the earnest of it.
Rem. It seems as if our portion here is very definitely marked out; there is no question of challenge, or of a
{269}
lawsuit.
C.A.C. It is the security and stability of being in the will of God, so that nothing can possibly fail.
Rem. It seems as if the apostle, instructed of God, is letting out his heart as to what is in the mind of God.
C.A.C. On our side it is just the question of having "heard the word of the truth, the glad tidings of your salvation".
Rem. How Job remarked on it in his day, "I know ... that thou canst be hindered in no thought of thine" (@Job 42: 2).
C.A.C. Very good. Yes, and we are not properly brought to God until we see that, are we? In being brought to God, we are brought to One whose will must prevail.
Ques. Is verse 12 the culmination of it? The result of all God has set Himself out to accomplish is the response.
C.A.C. Yes, "to the praise of his glory". Why does he distinguish between the "we" and the "you" at this point? He has in mind the Jew and the Gentile, has he not? There was a certain company that had pre-trusted -- a remarkable word -- a remnant of Jews that had trusted in Christ before the time; then there were the Gentiles. He throws into relief the extraordinary acting of God. So there were some who trusted before the time, and we come in along with the favoured company, and have the seal of the Spirit. It is a very distinctive matter, the seal of the Spirit.
Ques. Would it include those at the baptism?
Ques. And Anna and Simeon and those who looked for redemption in Israel?
C.A.C. Well, they would be among the pre-trusters, coming into the assembly, no doubt, later. We get it in the whole record of the gospels; the Lord was securing persons for that, and they were all pre-trusters -- before the day of the manifestation of His glory.
Rem. There are those who trusted Him "through their word" (@John 17: 20).
{270}
Ques. Is the sealing for the inheritance?
C.A.C. Peculiarly marked by the Holy Spirit. I suppose the angels would know every sealed person.
Ques. How would they discern?
C.A.C. Well, I cannot see how any person could carry the seal of God without intelligent beings like angels discerning it; it is a public witness. There should be a very decided evidence; there was then, why should there not be now?
Rem. The cloud coming down and then filling the tabernacle was both outward and inward.
C.A.C. One would covet that our being sealed was a more publicly recognisable fact.
{271}
NOTES OF A READING @EPHESIANS 1: 15 - 23
Rem. It is precious to have this utterance in prayer as a model.
C.A.C. It would suggest to us something of the character of assembly prayer. It would help brothers if they read all Paul's prayers before they came to the meeting for prayer.
Rem. The early part of the chapter is very much after the character of assembly worship, and this is now assembly prayer.
C.A.C. Yes, you have the Monday meeting now.
Rem. There is a difference in the manner of address in these two prayers (chapter 1: 17; 3: 14). Here it is "the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory", and in chapter 3 it is "the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ". Putting the two together is rather like @John 20, "I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God".
C.A.C. Yes, indeed. So whatever we think of God or the Father, it is in relation to that blessed Man.
Ques. What is the thought of "the Father of glory" (verse 17)?
C.A.C. Do you not think that whatever has the character of glory, the God of our Lord Jesus Christ is the Father of it? Is it the thought of an affectionate relation to the system of glory? We have the "God of glory" (@Acts 7: 2), He appeared in that character to Abraham; but here He is the "Father of glory".
Ques. I wondered whether it carried the thought of Originator, or whether, as the Father, He was marked with glory as sustaining those affections, all the glories of that system?
C.A.C. Yes, it is the thought of originating a whole system of glory, but He stands in relation to it as the Father.
{272}
I think it would give us more confidence in prayer, that we might pray more for glory now. If we are seeking glory, we are very likely to get it.
Ques. In what sense now?
C.A.C. I think that this epistle has told us. If we get the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, is that not glory? And "the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints", all that is glory; and the power that raised Christ from among the dead and is operating in the saints -- it all belongs to the system of glory. Paul had this sphere of glory before him; I think it encourages us to pray for it. We often pray for our temporal needs, illness and so on, but there is another order of things: do we pray about *that*? The Father would love to minister it to us now. Nothing is more glorious in one sense than having the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him; it is something in addition to having the Holy Spirit of promise.
Ques. The Ephesians would get that by the prayer of the apostle, but would it come to us by our own desires?
C.A.C. It suggests that there are things that come through prayer. There are certain things that ministry cannot give us and that the prayers of the apostle cannot; it can only be got directly from God by prayer -- but then it is *there*; it is to be had.
Rem. We are prone to be very content to remain below the level of our calling.
C.A.C. It is a wonderful realm of glory that these prayers refer to in chapters 1 and 3.
Rem. To be able to pray for it for ourselves or for others, we need to be in possession of what is spoken of here.
C.A.C. If we are in possession of it, we can ask to be in the full possession of it; so there is always room for more of this spirit of wisdom and revelation to be given to us by God.
Ques. Does ministry present things so that we should be intelligent as to what to pray for?
{273}
C.A.C. Yes.
Rem. The apostle says, "I do not count to have got possession myself; but one thing ... I pursue, looking towards the goal, for the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus" (@Philippians 3: 13, 14).
C.A.C. Yes. It is well to take up the prayer of Moses. He says, "Let me, I pray thee, see thy glory" (@Exodus 33: 18). Well, it is worth seeing! God's glory is worth seeing.
Rem. His prayer was answered on the mount of transfiguration.
Ques. Would you give some idea of what glory is? It would be different in every epistle in which it is presented -- Romans, Ephesians, Colossians, etc. We often have a vague idea of what glory really is.
C.A.C. In a certain way it transcends all human thought.
Ques. Would it be the moral excellence of God as seen in a Man, in Christ?
C.A.C. Yes, I thought so. It has often been said that glory is the excellence of a thing in display. There can be no greater glory for a creature than to have "the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him" -- the capacity to enter into and apprehend what is most excellent in the blessed God, brought out in His purposes of love. It is all brought out there.
Rem. That is the consummation of glory.
C.A.C. There is no greater thought of God than the glory of God in what He has prepared for the satisfaction of His love, so that we should know what is the hope of His calling. The saints enter into what the angels cannot enter into; they have not the same capacity as the saints, and so have a great deal to learn from the assembly.
Ques. Does verse 18 suggest a glory attaching to the saints as the inheritance of God?
C.A.C. Yes, it is what He has in His saints, and it is putting them into all that God has the enjoyment of, speaking simply. It is wonderful that God should have
{274}
picked up men and so enlightened them as having their place in the assembly that they can speak to Him as entering into all the treasures of His love. "In which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge" (@Colossians 2: 3). They can speak to Him intelligently. It is where these things are understood.
Rem. @1 Corinthians 2 says that the things which God has prepared for them that love Him He has revealed unto us by His Spirit -- the Spirit has revealed them.
C.A.C. Yes, and *searched*. "The Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God". That is, He comes over to our side and He searches the depths of God to know all that is there, because all these things are hid in the depths of God, and the Spirit has come into a relative position, so that He can search them out. They were known to the apostles. There is a man here who entered into it and can speak of it, and he says, I would like you to know how I got such a wonderful knowledge. Now they are ministered so that we can pray about them. All ministry is intended to turn to prayer. It is all grace, it is God's free giving. There is no epistle that magnifies grace like Ephesians.
Ques. Can you explain the expression, "The eyes of your heart"? Would it be the perception of the affections?
C.A.C. Yes, I think it shows that the great things of God are perceived by love.
Rem. It has been said that nothing is so intelligent as love. The wisdom of Solomon came out in that in connection with the two women (@1 Kings 3: 16 - 28); he knew love would respond.
C.A.C. So that our stature is in love. It is not in any human ability, nor in any divine gift, our stature is in love; and I do not know any reason why the humblest saint should not be as matured in love as the apostle Paul or John. We should never have Paul's gift, but it is quite within our range to be as formed in love as he was. We do not believe it, I know, but it is a fact!
{275}
Ques. Perhaps not all are so consumed with the desire to obtain it. Was your thought that we do not believe in the possibility, or that we do not desire it?
C.A.C. I think we are to entertain the possibility of it. We should lay ourselves out for it more if we thought it was a possibility. There is an unlimited power working towards us, the power that worked in Christ in raising Him from the dead; it is the same power.
Rem. The problem is things weighing us down.
C.A.C. Yes, that is the secret; we are minding earthly things and minding our own things. Paul said, 'All seek their own things; I have only got one man who is any different'.
Rem. In the prayer in chapter 3 the power works in us; it is not in us here.
C.A.C. Yes, here it is operative towards us. Well, he brings it in in chapter 1, that we may apprehend it objectively. It is the greatest power that wrought in Christ; nothing ever exceeds it. The power that wrought in all the saints is not so great as that. Paul says, I want you to know it, to take account of that. It is given eventually to bring us into the glorified condition, but it is known to us now.
Rem. It must be the entire overthrow of any other power against us; that ought to be an encouragement.
C.A.C. Quite so.
Rem. There are two great thoughts of encouragement here: God's thoughts for us, and His power to bring them about.
C.A.C. Yes, the power that wrought in Christ in raising Him from among the dead, and we want our eyes to be open to it.
Rem. It is not a question of the power operating in the future.
C.A.C. No, it is in the *past*; it is the working of God's power in raising Christ from among the dead, and it is towards those that believe, and it is nothing less than that.
{276}
Ques. Why does it say, "The hope of his calling"? Does it look on to the glorious end and actuality, and include it?
C.A.C. Yes, wonderful things are brought into the hope of His saints by the calling of God.
Ques. Is it the inheritance in a definite setting -- God's inheritance here?
C.A.C. Yes, as what God becomes possessed of for His enrichment and satisfaction in relation to His saints.
Ques. What would you understand by "the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints"? In @Colossians 1: 27 we get "the riches of the glory of this mystery .., which is Christ in you the hope of glory"; would this go further?
C.A.C. Well, words are used to stimulate our interest; 'riches' and 'glory' might well appeal to our hearts. It does clearly bring out the place of the saints, in a sense perhaps more wonderfully than any other aspect, that they should take up for God's satisfaction all that He can regard as His own inheritance. It is wonderful to think of God condescending to use human language to express such a thought. Even the language of Scripture fails to convey the glories of divine thoughts; still God uses it to convey something of it to our hearts. 'Inheritance' -- it is human language, a human thought. We know if a man comes of age he may come into a vast inheritance; some men do, they are born with the right of heirship and when of age come into possession of great property.
God sees fit to apply it to Himself, 'Now I am going to have an inheritance, a satisfaction throughout eternal ages'. He takes it up in His saints.
We might well consider these things in our wakeful nights; then we should have better nights than if we slept. It is better to lie awake all night thinking of the Lord, than to sleep. It is true!
{277}
NOTES OF A READING @EPHESIANS 1: 20 - 23; @EPHESIANS 2: 1 - 8
Rem. It all seems connected, could you indicate why?
C.A.C. Well, the desire of the apostle is that they should know the greatness of the power which God wrought in Christ in raising Him from among the dead. That was evidently prayer; but from the middle of verse 20 the character changes; it becomes statement -- it is a blessed statement of fact. The apostle goes on basing it on the prayer. He states a wondrous fact, that Christ is sitting down at the right hand of God in the heavenlies far above all principality and power, but that is not prayer. It is well to see that the translator has not noticed that sufficiently, but it is obvious to any careful reader.
It is an unfolding to us of the wondrous position in which God has set Him down at His right hand in the heavenlies. It is His *present* position, in which His lovers are intensely interested. It is to be deplored that there is not sufficient interest in the Lord's present position among believers -- that what should be of supreme interest to them is not much thought of. It is a marvellous thing to think of. If we once took that in, we should no longer be troubled with worldliness or earthly-mindedness.
Rem. The assembly is His fulness, His complement.
C.A.C. There would not be the vessel for the display of Christ apart from the assembly. It has pleased God that there should be a certain vessel, a formation, which is spiritually competent to receive, retain and express all the features of Christ, so that it can display what Christ is. The assembly is added to Him, so as to display in a creature vessel all that this Person gloriously exalted is.
This surpasses all the wildest imagination or thoughts or expectation of the creature man. It is the assembly viewed in its entirety, not the assembly as existing at any particular
{278}
moment. It would take in the whole assembly from Pentecost till the rapture; it is a universal thought.
The assembly is complete at any given moment. There is a vessel capable of expressing Christ at any given moment on the earth, and it does not say, 'If they are in the good of it' or 'in the light of it', but it is an *absolute fact*. The assembly is the body, the fulness of Him who fills all in all.
Ques. "The heavenlies" -- what does this mean?
C.A.C. It shows that "the heavenlies" is a very comprehensive expression, does it not? It applies in different ways in this epistle. "Blessed ... with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies", Christ is set down at the right hand of God in the heavenlies, and the saints are made to sit down in the heavenlies in chapter 2: 6. The object of it is to take our hearts entirely away from the earth; heavenly would seem to stand in contrast to what is earthly. In the Old Testament, God is spoken of as dwelling in heaven, but it is as the One who has His dwelling in heaven and who has His footstool on the earth. We have to gather the meaning of the words which the Spirit of God uses in the New Testament. It is a *spiritual* sphere in contrast to an earthly sphere. We all naturally gravitate towards the earth, our occupation of mind is all earthly, so for us to come under the influence of the heavenly is a very wonderful thing in its position and outlook.
What gives character to the heavenlies is that Christ is made to sit down there at God's right hand -- it is where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God. It is very much like finality, so that we do not get the rapture in this epistle.
The saints are actually there in spirit, 'In spirit there already', as we sometimes sing. The assembly is viewed here, not in its imperfection or immaturity, but as the product of God's workmanship. On our side there is nothing but death. There is not an element contributed from our side; it is a matter of grace. It is pure grace that the saints are saved with this *great* salvation. That we should
{279}
be brought into the assembly is just a matter of pure grace. "Head over all things to the assembly". The assembly will be capable, it will be found to be so when the veil is lifted over all that the blessed God is doing now. It will be seen that there is a vast company rendered capable of being so filled with Christ that there will not be a single feature of Christ which has not been possessed by it. It is a wonderful thought that the assembly is equal to the reception of all that Christ is so that it can be expressed in glorified conditions; it is the greatest thought of God. Hebrews speaks of "the heavenly things". The tabernacle was a pattern that brings in the heavenlies.
Ques. He "fills all in all". Will you say a word as to what "all in all" means?
C.A.C. I feel too small to say much about it. Chapter 4: 10 says, "He that descended is the same who has also ascended up above all the heavens, that he might fill all things". It would seem here that He is going to fill all things in the greatness of what has come out in the descending and ascending. In His descending He gave full expression as to what God is, and in ascending He gave full expression as to what *man* is according to divine purpose; and He is going to fill *all* things in the virtue of those two things. Someone said once that there is no allusion to the deity of Christ in Ephesians, but I think the fact that He fills all in all requires His deity. "The fulness of him who fills all in all" -- the fulness of Christ; it is a very wondrous thing to be the vessel of it. It is one of those immeasurable words -- "fills all in all".
It is presented to us as a great divine reality, but we have to let it soak into our souls. Am I prepared to let it, so that I am prepared to be saturated with it? There is not a single thing in the universe of bliss that is not going to be filled out of Christ. There will not be a moral element there which will not be filled out with Him. And think that the assembly is entitled to draw out of that Person -- out of
{280}
Christ, now. There is no limit to what the assembly is entitled to draw out of Christ now, it is illimitable.
It is very striking that He brings all this into such close comparison to all that we were in our lost and dead condition, "dead in your offences and sins". He seems purposely to bring two extremes together with not even a full stop between; we were dead in our sins, an act of death, though we walked in it, in sin. All this is to enhance to our minds the wonderful working of God, it is a background for it. On God's part it is a purely unsought activity of mercy and love, for none of us wanted it. It was God's moving in the blessedness of His own nature and choosing objects such as we were.
And the saints as saved by grace do not retain a single feature of what they were in Adam. God would teach us to divest ourselves of everything that we were marked by naturally. We were dead in offences and sins, sons of disobedience. We have to shed all that and view ourselves as purely subjects of mercy, and think of what *He* has done, even in making us to sit down in Him in the heavenlies. Being what we are, it is difficult for us to put completely out of sight everything but the work of Christ; but it is our privilege to do it.
The great act of God is that He has quickened us with the Christ.
Ques. What does "quickened" mean?
C.A.C. I suppose it means being made to live. He has made us to live with Christ and made us to sit down in the heavenlies in Christ. It is the thing viewed in its completeness, do you not think?
Ques. Has the apostle still in his mind Jew and Gentile?
C.A.C. It would seem that when he says "we" in verse 5, he is referring to the Jews, but when he says "ye" he is alluding to the Gentiles. The wonderful thing is that both Jew and Gentile are viewed in this state of death, and that
{281}
both are brought out of it by Christ's quickening power, so that they, as it were, go up together (the thought of leaving entirely Jew and Gentile) and are made to sit together in the heavenlies in an entirely new position. It is the complete divine thought, and I suppose it is salvation in the fullest possible sense. It is salvation that takes us completely off the earth and gives us a new status and position in Christ and gives us new affections. It needs this quickening power of God so that we can live in this new position suitably. We could not do so otherwise. The Lord breathed His own risen life into the apostles (@John 20: 22), and that is like quickening, so that "to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God" supposes a quickened company able to live along with the risen Christ. God would have the sense of that impressed upon our spirits, the need of divine quickening.
{282}
NOTES OF A READING @EPHESIANS 2: 11 - 22
Rem. The apostle emphasises the state of the Gentiles here: "Without Christ, aliens ..., and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world". We come in on the line of mercy, do we not?
C.A.C. I suppose it does not mean that we should dwell upon what we were, but that we should take account of it in contrast to the wholly new place that grace has called us into.
Rem. It is all intended to emphasise the magnitude of the grace.
C.A.C. That "now in Christ Jesus *ye* who once were afar off are become nigh by the blood of the Christ".
Ques. Do you think the difficulty of a number of Christians is that they are hanging back on what they are and not going forward, and God's thought is not received?
C.A.C. And some think it is a part of humility to own our shortcomings by nature and the corruption of the flesh; there is no liberty found in that, but in seeing that the most marvellous contrast has come in by divine purpose as announced -- "But now".
Rem. The thought of 'miserable sinners' might be a good balance for us, but the thought of sonship is God's thought.
C.A.C. I think that is what gives pleasure to God. It must be pleasing to the Father that we should dwell upon that. All this is to enhance the blessedness of the new position. "But now in Christ Jesus ye who once were afar off are become nigh by the blood of the Christ"; that is the new position, and I suppose when the words "in Christ Jesus" are used, the implication is that the saints have taken up the new position. It is not simply, 'in Christ'; that is the divine purpose. They are viewed as having *taken up* the
{283}
status with God.
Ques. Why is the "become nigh" connected with the blood of Christ?
C.A.C. It is remarkable that it should be put that way; it seems to be in all the value of the blood of Christ.
Ques. Do you take that to be the present tense? It speaks of the blood as though it were existing -- I mean the existing good of the blood; the efficacy remains of what is secured. It remains before God, and the saints are established.
C.A.C. That is, anything that could bring in a shade of distance has been met by the blood of the Christ. It is not here exactly the cross, it is the abiding place of the saints in contrast to the "afar off" place. They are become nigh, God would have it so. It is not exactly by any change in themselves, but by the blood of the Christ, a power outside themselves that can never be diminished. Simplicity of faith on our side would gladly take up the place of nearness -- we "are become nigh". I suppose you might say that it is nearness to God in a dispensational sense, if that is understandable.
Rem. It is true of all positionally in the chapter.
C.A.C. It is the character of the dispensation. It is something that Abraham, David and Moses never knew, and never could know.
Rem. In that way it applies to saints on earth who have not died.
C.A.C. Yes.
Rem. While Israel had a favoured nearness, it was not this. They are brought in now.
C.A.C. That dispensation was one of distance. The ordinary Israelite could not enter the holy place, still less the holiest of all; there was a mark of distance all the time, but all that has dispensationally passed away, and the position is one of nearness, not through the holy character and title of persons, but by the blood of the Christ, so that
{284}
there is an infinite value attached to it.
Ques. Would you say more of the linking it up with "in Christ Jesus"?
C.A.C. Is it not that the saints are conscious of a new position in Christ Jesus? It is not at all a question of what they are according to flesh, but they are "in Christ Jesus".
Ques. It puts it, "Now in Christ Jesus *ye* who once were afar off are become nigh by the blood of the Christ". Does that suggest a collective idea? It must be the saints together, I suppose?
C.A.C. Yes. It is the blessing that has reached the Gentiles. The thought of the Jew and the Gentile is in the mind of the apostle all through this passage. Peace is between the Jew and the Gentile, it is not peace with God. The Jew and the Gentile are "made both one".
Rem. Peter could speak in @Acts 15 in relation to the Jew and the Gentile; "We believe that we shall be saved by the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same manner as they also"; so from this the middle wall was broken down, was it not? The Gentile comes in on the same line as the Jew, and Israel comes in on the same line as the Gentile.
C.A.C. Yes, it is very striking.
Rem. Verse 16 refers to them, I suppose.
C.A.C. Yes. I suppose there could be no greater difference between men, than between the Jew and the Gentile, and if all that is obliterated, how small and insignificant the differences between saints are. They should all perish in the light of Christ and the cross. What makes differences must be something of that which was ended at the cross. It is the thought of persons not only away from God, but from each other, now brought very nigh to God and very nigh to each other, so that they actually become one.
Rem. It is in Himself, "that he might form the two in himself into one new man". It is really the truth of another Man.
{285}
Rem. I was struck that their relation not only to God, but also to one another seems to come in. So that the relation of the saints one to another is more important than we sometimes think.
C.A.C. I am sure it is, especially if we think of the mystery, which is the particular truth at the present time.
Ques. Would you enlarge a little on the expression, "one new man"?
C.A.C. Well, it is evidently a collective idea. It seems to suggest the kind of material that can really be formed into one body. I thought the new man was like the moral material, and the body is the result.
Ques. "In one body" -- what is that, is that the saints?
C.A.C. I thought so. He has reconciled both (Jew and Gentile) in one body by the cross -- that is the great result, that there is one body for the pleasure of God. Then there could not be such a result as that if the new man had not come in -- the new man morally. I suppose it takes all the people in the world to set forth the old man; and it takes all the saints to make up the new man.
Ques. "Man" there is man in a general way?
C.A.C. Yes, and the saints as such have put off the old man and put on the new, and are so addressed in this epistle. But here it is all looked at as effected by Christ Himself; it is Christ who has made of twain one new man, so making peace; and that He might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby; and came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh. It is all what Christ has done; it is looked at as completed.
This is what He has done, and He announces it now. It is very blessed; He accomplishes the whole thing Himself, whether I understand it or not, and at the present moment He is the Announcer of it to Gentile and Jew.
It is wonderful to see that Christ has undertaken to give effect to all that is in the mind of God, and He is presented
{286}
here as having done it; Christ Himself is the Preacher. The glad tidings do not refer to His incarnation, but He has come in a spiritual sense to announce the peace that He has Himself accomplished.
I think it refers to Him in His present position; it is marked by the coming of Christ to announce all that He has brought to pass; and if we listened to Him He would tell us all that.
"If ye have heard him and been instructed in him according as the truth is in Jesus", as the apostle says later on (chapter 4: 21). If we did, He would tell us wonderful things, and things that have all been effected in His wonderful Person.
Ques. May I ask as to access to the Father?
C.A.C. We both have access -- that is our privilege as saints of this dispensation. The whole Trinity is involved in the matter; it is "through" Christ, "by one Spirit" and "to the Father", so the great truth at this time is that we have access to the Father.
Rem. It is important to carry in our minds the thought of Christ and the Spirit, Both being necessary in access to the Father.
C.A.C. Yes, apart from Christ and the Spirit there is no such thing as access to the Father.
Rem. In the days of His flesh He could say, "No one comes to the Father unless by me" (@John 14: 6).
C.A.C. Yes, I suppose that verse 18 is a wonderful summary of the privilege of the moment. We could hardly have it more precisely stated: "Through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father".
Rem. So we should not give the place some would give to Mary in this way.
C.A.C. No, she has no mediatorial place whatever.
She is the most blessed saint, the most highly favoured above others, but she has no mediatorial place.
Ques. Access to the Father is to be known
{287}
individually, but it is to be experienced in a peculiar way when in assembly, would you say?
C.A.C. Yes, we are able as together to leave in spirit anything that divides us and keeps us apart; if not, we have no access to the Father. If there is a bad feeling between a brother and sister, it is utterly impossible. But we have the privilege to leave all that order of things, through Christ and the Spirit, as the Conductors, so to speak, by whom we have access to the Father. It is remarkable how the Lord Jesus and the Spirit take a subservient place in connection with this great privilege. I think we should weigh that carefully.
Rem. It would help us to understand the revelation of the Godhead.
C.A.C. Christ and the Spirit have taken up a position of service in connection with our access to the Father. The access to the Father is the great point -- through Christ and by the Spirit.
Ques. Do you think that the point is that They have come over to the side of the saints?
C.A.C. I think it would greatly help us in assembly service if we understood the relative position into which divine Persons have come. Sometimes there is an addressing of divine Persons as if it did not much matter which was addressed, but it does matter very much. There is a time when Christ is Himself before us, and there is a time when He takes a place of service in relation to the Father, and He serves us in that way. His great concern is that we should have access to the Father. The Spirit also has taken a place of service in connection with this truth, that we should have access to the Father.
{288}
BUILDING
@Ephesians 2: 20 - 22
In @Ephesians 2: 20 - 22 it is not a question exactly of who builds, but of the character of the building and the object in view. It is also important to notice that it is a present structure brought into being in conditions of responsibility, because it is in Jesus Christ, and in the Lord, and in the Spirit. It is also contrasted with the former state of being "strangers and foreigners". It is what we are brought into here and now, the apostles and prophets being men who have lived and laboured in this world, and who have become the foundation of what stands here for God. That building is distinguished by its corner-stone. One Person is pre-eminent there in contrast with every other. It is Jesus Christ the Man of divine pleasure -- each saint contributes something to set Him forth, for Jesus Christ is to be recognised as in us, as the result of Christ speaking in some one. If Jesus Christ is not in us we are reprobates, i.e. we are worthless for God (@2 Corinthians 13). Jesus Christ being in us involves that we are able to move in His life morally as set forth in @Psalm 16. There is a vast company here on earth in whom Jesus Christ is thus made prominent, and in all the spiritual activities of the company, in all ministry, He is the pre-eminent One as the great Adornment of the structure. And it is in Him the whole building is fitted together; i.e. it is in the features and characteristics of that Man.
From the Corinthian point of view, Jesus Christ is the foundation, and each one who builds on it must be careful to build what is in keeping with it. He must build what has spiritual value before God. Corrupting the temple would be by false teaching or in making prominent the man after the flesh.
It is important to see that fitting together leads to increase in temple conditions. If fleshly elements are at
{289}
work there cannot be fitting together nor increase. Of course this must be secured locally if there are to be temple conditions. As we are together templewise we get divine light, and then we can be together bodywise and the light is diffused so that all gain by it. But this is a matter of growth.
{290}
NOTES OF AN ADDRESS @EPHESIANS 2: 13 - 18; @EPHESIANS 3: 14 - 21
I want to speak of two things, the calling of God and the state that is suited to it. First, the wonderful calling with which we are called. In the mind of God it is His blessed purpose and pleasure and delight that we should know what His calling is.
The only part of it I would now speak of is "access ... to the Father". "Through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father". It is a most wonderful thing, beloved brethren, because it is very evident that we could not have access to the Father if He had not made Himself fully known, and, on the other hand, we could not have access to Him if we were not suitable to Him. Now what a blessed thought it is that the Father has told Himself out, for there is not a single thing in the heart of the Father that has not been fully expressed; it has all come out in the Son of His love. And, beloved brethren, it is really in the company of Christ that we know the Father. It is a wonderful thing that we should know the Father by being in the company of the Son. The Lord says to Philip, "Am I so long a time with you, and thou hast not known me, Philip? He that has seen me has seen the Father" (@John 14: 9).
The assembly is the place to learn the Father, because in the assembly we are in the company of the Son, and He makes known the Father's name. Now, beloved brethren, what a circle of love! It is necessary that we should be completely outside of the flesh. There are lots of believers who are not clear in the presence of the Father; they cannot get free from the thought of their imperfection, they are always under a cloud.
We cannot get into the presence of the Father except as deriving from Christ. We are not there as children of Adam at all, and we are free to enter into a sphere where there is
{291}
no imperfection. The calling is that we should have access to the Father. There is a blessed circle into which our hearts can come, conducted into it by the Son.
What is worship? Our appreciation of the Father, that is what it is. And our appreciation of a divine Person must be adoration. We enter into it by the Spirit. It is a scene of ineffable love, and there is no room in it for anything but adoration. There is nothing less than that in the Father's heart for every one of us.
We get the state of the calling in chapter 3, the state which qualifies us to enter into the calling. We could not possibly enter into such a calling without a divine state. If I am to know the Father it must be by the Spirit of the Father. "That the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts", that blessed Person occupying our hearts. He has been everything to God, He has filled the heart of God. The thought is that the One who fills the heart of God fills the heart of the saint; that is, He has His place there. Everything else has gone out of the believer's heart but Christ, and the result is that we being "rooted and founded in love ... may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height; and to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge". It is a great thing that in the assembly we are brought to know the calling of the Father, to enter into it -- this wonderful calling! -- that we should have "access ... to the Father". And that we should be suitable to it, that Christ might dwell in our hearts by faith, Christ filling the vision of our souls.
Let us see that we do not despise the pleasant land. We shall fall in the wilderness if we do not go in for the calling of God; we shall miss the present thought of the Father's heart. We shall have it by and by but we could miss it now. It is a question of going in for it and of getting on our knees about it.
May the Lord give us to know the wonderful character of
{292}
it, and to know what it is to be formed in that state which enables us really to enter into it.
{293}
NOTES OF A READING @EPHESIANS 3: 13 - 21
Rem. The whole chapter from verse 3 is a parenthesis, it was pointed out last time.
Ques. In verse 12 we have the thought of "boldness and access in confidence by the faith of him". To what is the access?
C.A.C. Well, I suppose the whole character of the mystery would come out in the way that the saints approach God, because the object is that principalities and authorities in the heavenlies might learn through the assembly the all-various wisdom of God.
Rem. It is the working out of the mystery He had in mind.
C.A.C. Yes, I think the working of it out is in the actual coming together of the saints.
Ques. Do you refer to the order seen in the assembly?
C.A.C. Yes, I thought so, and the intelligence of the assembly is seen in the access to God.
Rem. This boldness corresponds with John's epistle where love emboldens.
C.A.C. Yes, "boldness and access in confidence" go together, the wonderful system of approach to God being set up according to the truth of the mystery, and set up for the instruction of principalities and authorities. We refer sometimes to the assembly as an august company.
Rem. If the unbeliever is impressed at the ministry meeting at the divine presence, how much more the principalities and authorities would be impressed by this.
C.A.C. They would be impressed to see creatures, who are far inferior to them in point of creature glory, so superior in point of intelligence and access to God, and would see the all-various wisdom of God in it; that should come out in the assembly, I think.
{294}
Ques. What are the "all things" in verse 9? Does it stand in relation to the assembly or does it mean all things in a general way?
C.A.C. I think it means "all things". The wonderful thing is that the assembly has a kind of central place in the "all things".
Ques. Is the assembly like the great divine masterpiece?
C.A.C. Yes, I think so. It is the deepest expression of the wisdom of God. There is nothing like it in heaven or on earth; and to think of that coming out intelligently in the assembly in expression and utterances by men that the angelic host can take account of intelligently! They can only take note of it as it comes under their notice in human beings. It gives a wonderful idea of the assembly as convened and lifts us out of human thoughts altogether.
One feels the greatness of it, if there is ability to express to God all that is in His mind and heart. Eating the Lord's supper is not the end of our coming together.
Ques. Perhaps you will explain that?
C.A.C. Well, is it not the beginning? It claims the attention of the youngest and feeblest believer and sometimes they think it is the end to be reached in itself, but it is the beginning. The all-various wisdom of God coming out in the assembly and being given expression to there is the main thing, is it not?
The apostle always gives a reason for his prayers, he says why (verse 14, "For this reason").
Ques. Would it give a high order of intelligence when it is so, so that all should be edified as well as God praised?
C.A.C. That is true; we are so slow to take up the service of God in the true character of it. We not only take up the service of praising God, but are to say why we praise, so that the principalities and authorities in the heavens listen with wonder. That is something to covet.
Ques. I should like to ask, does it here view the
{295}
assembly as having no previous history, or as persons viewed as in chapter 2, dead in offences and sins?
C.A.C. Well, the epistle clearly takes account of the former condition, and Scripture takes account of redemption. Everything that God does is based on redemption. It indicates that there has been a state contrary to God; but He works in a scene of death and the saints are quickened, raised and made to sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ. That is God's working. And God's thought comes out in Jew and Gentile being set together, showing that there is a former status that was contrary. We should not know God at all if not conscious that a state of sin and death had come in. We could not worship without it. "Boldness and access in confidence" all seems to suggest that once it was not so. But now by the faith of Christ, "by the faith of him", we have boldness and access in confidence, so that we must have Christ before us in order to have any liberty. So I suppose that is why the Supper is the first thing, as it suggests Christ to us and gives us to feed upon Christ.
Rem. So that the object of this prayer is "that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts".
C.A.C. Yes, I think it is most important as the condition for worship. The prayer really gives the state in the saints that is essential for worship.
Ques. I would like to ask in connection with the thought of the cup -- the blood -- is it more in connection with the sprinkling in @Exodus 24, the thought of the covenant?
C.A.C. I think that @Exodus 24 illustrates it, because the result of the sprinkling is that they go up, and Moses higher still eventually. There is liberty to go up. I think the Lord's supper, especially the cup, would fill every heart with liberty.
I think there is a wonderful going up in this chapter; we go up into that which is eternal, "Glory in the assembly in

Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages". We go up into the eternal.
The intelligences see not only what God is abstractly, but what He is as known to creatures -- so known that they can worship as none others can. Each member of the body is a contributing factor; every sister and silent brother contributes -- not but that he might do better!
Ques. I suppose it would be seen in every coming together of the assembly, not only at the Supper?
C.A.C. Well, the Lord's Day morning is particularly the time for going up. It is the only occasion when we come together with worship distinctly before us. This is the state of heart in the saints who have received through the apostle the truth of the mystery. We are poor in it, but it is for us to see that we enter into it, so that we approach in the light of the mystery.
Rem. What a wonderful vessel the assembly is -- God expressed in it.
C.A.C. Yes, indeed.
Ques. I should like to be clear on the scope of this chapter; would it not have a bearing on the saints in a general way, the light of the mystery?
C.A.C. Then the more we apprehend it through ministry and the study of Scripture, the more concerned we should be to see it worked out.
Ques. What is the administration? How does it work out in a practical way?
C.A.C. Well, it works out in the assembly as convened.
Rem. We meet in the wilderness position.
C.A.C. Oh yes, and if we are not right in the wilderness position we should not be right in this position. The Supper is to put us right in the wilderness position. Order is in the wilderness position. There is more than that, there is a going up into the elevated region of the mystery, and a going up together too.
{297}
What goes on then in the assembly convened is that all might be brought into line with the truth; so that brothers taking part bear in mind, or should do, the great variety of states of soul there is, and have in mind that all are to come into it. God's mind is that not one is to be left out in this wonderful approach, not approach as poor sinners but in the light of the mystery.
Rem. The "Amen" at the end of this chapter would show all are brought in.
C.A.C. You can say "Amen" to lots of things that you are not up to! One might feel, Well, I cannot understand that, but it is very good -- Amen!
Ques. But should there not be understanding?
C.A.C. There should be the ability to appreciate it, which should be in every one indwelt by the Spirit, and they should be able to appreciate everything of God when it is expressed.
Ques. Why does the apostle say "not to faint" (verse 13)?
C.A.C. There might have been a disposition to faint. I think that Paul's being a prisoner would naturally be a discouragement, and though outward circumstances were very depressing, Paul is saying, It is all right. It pleased God that this wonderful truth of the mystery should come out in a man in such circumstances. 'My suffering is your glory, you ought to boast in it'.
Ques. In what way did it work out for their glory?
C.A.C. Well, I suppose his tribulation arose because he would give the Gentiles such an extraordinary position. When Paul told the Jews that the Lord had said, "I will send thee to the nations afar off", then they would not hear a word more (@Acts 22: 21). But he suffered because he would have the blessing go forth to the Gentiles.
Ques. Does Paul refer to it when he says, "I rejoice in sufferings for you, and I fill up that which is behind of the tribulations of Christ in my flesh, for his body, which is the assembly" (@Colossians 1: 24).
{298}
C.A.C. Yes, it is another expression of the same thought. The ministry of it to us has cost something. Do the Gentiles value the truth of the mystery generally? They do not. Well, we must not let it fall, we must love and cherish it more than ever, for I think God has peculiar delight in a few poor souls who cherish the mystery.
So in the light of all this we can see what moves the apostle in prayer; for we come into it. He bows his knees to the Father, of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named.
It brings out how the family thought is a very extended one. If God comes out as Father, it suggests the family thought. He is going to impress the family thought on every company, so that all stand in some relation to Him as Father. Father is the name of revelation. Every family will take its character from the Father; the Father puts some impression on every family. The Old Testament saints will carry an impression eternally of the Father. They did not know Him as the Father, but the Father will name them.
Rem. In @Revelation 14 His name is written upon their foreheads.
C.A.C. And it is His Father's name, is it not? There is going to be a certain unity between all the different families of saints, whichever you think of; the saints of the remnant, the millennial saints, etc.
"One God and Father of all", it says (@Ephesians 4: 6). "My Father and your Father ... . my God and your God" (@John 20: 17) -- I think that belongs to the assembly.
Rem. So that there is a certain relationship also between all the families.
C.A.C. There is an extraordinary measure of divine giving contemplated in verse 16, "That he may give you according to the riches of his glory". The riches of the Father's glory -- that is the measure of it.
Rem. He makes a lot of "riches" -- the riches of His mercy, of His grace and of His glory.
{299}
Ques. Is it not a similar expression used in @Philippians 4: 19; is there a connection?
C.A.C. Yes, in seeing the immensity of it; this is the great possibility.
Rem. Our blessing never drops down to the level of Old Testament saints; even the riches are according to His glory.
Rem. In naming all the families, they each will have some distinction.
C.A.C. Yes, some impression of Christ to the Father's glory.
Ques. For the earthly saints in the millennial day, will it be Jehovah or the Father?
C.A.C. Well, they will stand in relation to Jehovah, but we cannot exactly keep the Father out of it, can we? The Father's appointments will be carried out in relation to every family, His thoughts of blessing realised. It is God known in the supreme name of grace. And all are going to be blessed in relation to Christ, with an impression of Christ in their affections. That is the reason for the prayer for strengthening, so that the One who is the centre of all God's counsels should dwell in our hearts through faith.
Of the Old Testament saints it says that "they should not be made perfect without us" (@Hebrews 11: 40); so that they will have to wait for the assembly and not get their blessing before us.
{300}
THE CROWN OF LOVE
@Ephesians 3: 14 - 21; @Revelation 2: 4; @Revelation 3: 7 - 11
I desire to bring before our hearts the exceeding greatness and blessedness of what the Father would bring us into, not only for our joy but for His own joy and satisfaction. What we get in @Ephesians 3 is really the crown of everything, you could not conceive anything beyond it. The apostle prays that the Father would grant them according to the riches of His glory to be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man. Think of that! The riches of the Father's glory! And it is according to that that we are to be strengthened with might by the Father's Spirit. Now do not let us think that these things are mere sentiment. It is a great moment for every one of our hearts when we come to the sense that divine things are real; they are great realities.
In addressing Philadelphia the Lord says, "Thou hast a little strength". It is not a reproach. It means that in the midst of a profession where there is absolutely no strength at all, there is a little company who know what it is in some measure to be strengthened according to the riches of the Father's glory and by the Father's Spirit. That is the source of the "little strength" of Philadelphia. I think if our hearts were awakened to the great thoughts of divine love, we should find there was illimitable power, measureless power, to bring our hearts into the crown of the blessings. It is a great thing morally for even one heart to enter into the secret delight and pleasure of the Father's heart. Now it is open for every one of us to go in for it. It is greater than any gift; the Father's glory, the Father's love, the love of Christ, lie behind all gift. The most wonderful privilege lies within the reach of each heart. Are we really awakened by the grace of our God to go in for it? The apostle prays that He would grant them "to be strengthened" by the *Father's* Spirit; that is, the very Spirit of Him who is the Source of
{301}
all the counsels of love, and it is according to the *riches of His glory*. The Father's Spirit is to be *in us*, and we are to be strengthened with power in the inner man. And what is it for? It is "that the Christ might dwell, through faith, in your hearts, being rooted and founded in love, in order that ye may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height; and to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge; that ye may be filled even to all the fulness of God". O what immense things these are! They are the very crown of the blessing. The divine nature, the love of Christ, that is the very crown of the blessing. Cast your little sounding line in and see if you can gather that!
In @Revelation 2 we find that this church (Ephesus) has lost the crown. What the apostle set before the Ephesians might have *attracted* but did not *command* their hearts, and so the Lord has to say, "I have against thee, that thou hast left thy first love". They had lost the very crown. You find how faithful, how diligent they were, but they did not know these great things -- what it was "to be strengthened with power by his Spirit". Now, beloved brethren, that is just the history of the church; she has lost her crown, she has lost the crown of *love*.
What is so very interesting in Philadelphia is to see that there is a little company at the end to whom the Lord gives back the crown; they have got the love of Christ. What marks them is that they have a little strength, they are strengthened by the Spirit of the Father, and the result of it is, "Thou ... hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name". We find these Philadelphians displayed these things; they kept His word, which is the expression of all that He is in Himself, and His *name* includes His glory. Now, beloved brethren, think of what a thing it is to have enshrined in our hearts His *word* and His *name*! The true distinction of such a company as that is the knowledge of the love of Christ. So He says, "I will cause that they shall
{302}
come and shall do homage before thy feet, and shall know that I have loved thee". That is the true distinction of the church, to be *loved by* Christ. And I say, the knowledge of that love is the very crown of the blessing. The love of Christ is a secret now, a perfect secret between the heart and Christ; but there is a day coming when it will be made public. What a solemn word we have in verse 11, "Hold fast what thou hast, that no one take thy crown". If we know what it is to have that crown given back to us, He says, 'Hold it fast, do not let any one take it from you'.
Beloved brethren, if our hearts are crowned with divine love, you may depend upon it that all the power of Satan and all the influences of the world will be against us. The great effort of the enemy is to take away the crown. The Lord keep us true to Himself till He come!
{303}
LOVE WHICH SURPASSES KNOWLEDGE
@Ephesians 3: 19
To know the love of the Christ is the consummation of blessing -- the very crown of christianity. The greatest endowment and the highest distinction of the church is that she is the subject of -- she is enriched by -- that precious love. And God would have each one of our hearts to find its glory, its satisfaction and its joy in the knowledge of that love. I purpose to bring some of the manifestations and activities of the love of Christ before your hearts at this time; and I trust that each one of us may be profoundly affected as we trace in Scripture a few of the steps and stages of the soul's progress in love which lead on in a path of growing light to the goal spoken of in @Ephesians 3: 19: "And to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge".
I desire to begin at a point where the very youngest believer may find himself in touch with the love of that blessed Person who is crowned with honour and glory at the right hand of God. @Revelation 1: 5, 6 brings before us His love as Saviour. "Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father: to him be the glory and the might to the ages of ages. Amen".
It is a blessed fact that every believer is washed from his sins, but it is of the greatest moment to remember that this could only be accomplished through death. Christ has "washed us ... in his blood". He has cleared us of everything that attached to us in our responsibility as Adam's children. He has offered "one sacrifice for sins", and "by one offering he has perfected in perpetuity the
{304}
sanctified" (@Hebrews 10: 12, 14). And if there is a timorous, burdened soul here tonight, longing to be able to say, 'I am my Lord's and He is mine', it is my joy to assure you that you are welcome to Christ. God puts that blessed Saviour within your reach at this moment. Your sins, your weakness, your temptations, your many efforts which have ended in failure, are all known to God, but you are at this moment welcome to Christ. Believe on Him now and be saved.
Perhaps the majority of those present are assured of the completeness and efficacy of the Saviour's work, but I would that every heart knew better the *love* in which that work was wrought. Love is the secret that lies behind it all -- its source and the measure of its value. It was deep divine love that would have us clear of every spot and stain. If you love a person, you would like that person to be clear of every deformity -- to be free from blemish. If Christ has washed us from our sins, it was not chiefly to relieve us, but to clear us in the presence of His love from everything that was painful to His love. And this imposed a necessity upon Him for which nothing but infinite love could have been equal. For it necessitated His death -- it necessitated the unreserved surrender of the Holy One to bear under judgment and in death the whole desert and consequence of sin and sins. In short, it involved all that is brought before our hearts by the unfathomable words, "The sacrifice of himself" (@Hebrews 9: 26, Authorised Version). Nothing but supreme and ineffable love could have been equal to such a necessity, and nothing could bear greater testimony to that love than the fact that He has "washed us from our sins in his blood".
Believer, let it sink down into your heart that there is something greater and more precious than the Saviour's work; yes, greater than the mighty act of redemption; and that greater thing is the *love* in which it was undertaken and accomplished. It is a wonderful moment for the believer when the thought of this love first enters his soul. Because
{305}
it is not a love which exhausted itself in what it accomplished. It is an abiding love -- a present love -- which is set free by what it has done, so that it is now an unstraitened, triumphant love, for it has removed everything about us that was painful to itself. And there is a present outgoing of that deep and precious love from the heart of the Lord Jesus towards each one of His own in this world today. Many here are acquainted with the fact that this verse reads more accurately, "To him who *loves us*", not "loved us". His love is a present reality. May God make it good to each of our hearts in the power of the Holy Spirit!
I believe the characteristic mark of every one who has come consciously within the circle of Christ's love is that his heart is possessed with real desire to know the thoughts of that love. It gives the soul an entirely new starting-point. It is no longer, What have I got? or What can I do? It is not even, How can I be happier, or holier, or more useful? All such questions centre in self after all. The heart is absorbed and commanded by the blessedness of divine love, and would fain know that love in the circle of its own thoughts, and of its own satisfaction. And while I say this I cannot help adding a few words suggested by the scripture before us. To be washed from our sins is, after all, a negative blessing, and it is in view of something else. To be washed from my sins might satisfy the cravings of my conscience, but it would not satisfy the love of my Saviour. It was the thought of His love to make us "a kingdom, priests to his God and Father". He has cleared us that He might bring us to His God and Father in priestly fitness and nearness. He has cleared us with a view to our being made priests to approach God in His sanctuary. It was His object to secure a company of many sons for the satisfaction of His Father. I trust no one here will rest content with that part of the blessing which meets our need. I am sure that if we get a sense of His love we shall earnestly long to enter into, and
{306}
to answer to, the thoughts and intentions of that love. May it be so increasingly with us all!
I wish now to say a little on that activity of love in which Christ is our Advocate with the Father. "And if any one sin, we have a patron with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous" (@1 John 2: 1). The apprehension of this is of great practical importance, for Satan is ever ready to take advantage of any breakdown on our part, and to suggest that we have behaved so badly that we cannot now count upon divine love. Satan's object is to deprive our hearts of the consciousness of divine love, and thus effectually to block the way to restoration. There is nothing that operates so mightily to produce self-judgment and confession as the consciousness of the fact that divine love is unchanged. There is no cessation of the activity of that love if we sin. Our sin becomes the occasion of a different kind of activity, it is true, but the love is unchanged.
The advocacy of Christ is not exercised in a court of justice but in the home of love -- it is "with the Father". And Jesus Christ is there as "the righteous". He is there as the One who has glorified God completely about the sins of those for whom He is now the Advocate. His presence there is the blessed and abiding testimony that there cannot possibly be any question of imputation of sin to the believer. Divine Persons are now concerned about the one who has sinned, and the object of Their solicitude is that he should be restored to the proper affections and behaviour of one who belongs to the circle of divine love. Sin is entirely inconsistent with that circle, and the one who has sinned has allowed something which must necessarily interrupt the communion proper to that circle. The advocacy of Christ is exercised entirely with a view to our restoration, and I believe every movement of repentance in our souls is wrought by the Spirit as the outcome of that advocacy. If we are brought into exercise of soul about our condition, it is the outcome of the advocacy of Christ, and it is really a
{307}
witness of the love which is active for our restoration. The thought of this breaks us down. When a shade has come in, and the heart has got away, nothing has such power to move us and to break us down as a sense of the unchanging love of Jesus Christ and the Father, and the Holy Spirit delights to impart this to our hearts.
It has often been said that the point of departure is the point of recovery, and this is certainly true. But souls often lose much time by attempting to find their own way back to the point of departure. We can no more restore ourselves when we have got away than we could save ourselves. We are as dependent upon Christ for restoration as we were for salvation. He alone can lead us back to the point of departure. He knows all the intricacies of our path of wandering which we could never trace out, and He knows the secret source of weakness and decline which may be entirely hidden from ourselves. But if He alone can give us divine restoration it is most encouraging to remember that it is the pleasure of His love to do this. I am sure the thought of this would draw hearts to Him in great confidence, and in being thus drawn to Him is the true way and power of restoration.
Then in @Romans 8: 34 - 37, we have set before us the love of Christ as Intercessor. "Christ who has died, but rather has been also raised up; who is also at the right hand of God; who also intercedes for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? tribulation or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? According as it is written, For thy sake we are put to death all the day long; we have been reckoned as sheep for slaughter. But in all these things we more than conquer through him that has loved us".
The enemy, finding himself completely baffled in every attempt to lay anything to the charge of God's elect or to bring them under condemnation before God, will harass and persecute them in proportion to their fidelity to Christ.
{308}
The seven things here alluded to represent all the power of the enemy in the way of persecution and pressure, by which he seeks to discourage the saints of God, and, if possible, to crush them. Though the fires of Smithfield are no longer kindled, and Christians in this country are not at present exposed to imprisonment and the tortures of the Inquisition, there is an immense amount of persecution abroad. In the home circle, in the shop, the workroom, the office, and the factory, Christians are subjected to petty annoyances; mean advantages are taken of them, to say nothing of the ridicule and contempt to which they are often subject, and in many cases there is the expression of real hatred towards them. I suspect there are not many who have sought in any measure to be faithful to the Lord who have not experienced something of this. People who are kind and amiable in other things often become cruel persecutors when it is a question of Christ. Many a husband and wife have got on very well together until one of them was converted, but after that the converted one has had to prove something of the meaning of the words, "For thy sake we are put to death all the day long" (@Romans 8: 36).
Now what will sustain the heart under pressure of this kind is the knowledge of the love of Christ -- that love in which He enters into all the pressure, and considers the effect of it upon our spirits, and makes intercession for us as to it all, so that we may "more than conquer". As we apprehend this activity of His love we are greatly strengthened to face the opposition. There is One in the highest place -- in the place of power, for He is at the right hand of God -- whose love is active to sustain us; One whose hands never get "heavy" like those of Moses (@Exodus 17: 12), and whose intercession never fails. The knowledge of this sustains our hearts in confidence and courage. If we lose the consciousness of the love of Christ we become spiritually weak -- we fall behind as did some of old -- and when Amalek assails us we are in great danger.
{309}
"Remember what Amalek did unto thee on the way, when ye came forth out of Egypt; how he met thee on the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, all the feeble that lagged behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary, and he feared not God" (@Deuteronomy 25: 17, 18). It is to be feared that many are smitten in this way. They are spiritually weak; they have not enough knowledge of the love of Christ to stand persecution, and when it arises they are very soon discouraged and overcome by it. May God establish our hearts in the love of Christ that "in all these things we more than conquer through him that has loved us".
I will now go a step further, and say a few words about the love of Christ as Deliverer. "I am crucified with Christ, and no longer live, I, but Christ lives in me; but in that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me" (@Galatians 2: 20). "For the love of the Christ constrains us, having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died; and he died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised" (@2 Corinthians 5: 14, 15).
Many approach the subject of deliverance almost entirely from the side of their own needs and exercises. They are distressed by certain things in themselves which are not what they could wish. They get before them a certain ideal of what they would like to be, and if they could come up to their ideal they would be quite happy. Most of those who go in for holiness by faith have not got beyond this. They do not enter much into the blessed thoughts of God. They only desired to be rid of the painful and discreditable part of the flesh, and having got power for this, as they suppose, they are content. They can still go on with all the things in which respectable and reputable flesh -- religious flesh -- has its life. This is a very poor kind of holiness; there is nothing very elevated or attractive in it to a spiritual mind. But it is what results from approaching the subject entirely
{310}
from the side of need and expedience. To get the full measure of anything in divine things we must approach it from God's side, and from the standpoint of divine love. Everything is then seen as the infinitely beautiful, and I may add, the necessary outcome of that love which is the blessed source of all "the things that are freely given to us of God" (@1 Corinthians 2: 12).
Now what we learn from the two scriptures I have read is that nothing would suit divine love but the complete removal of man after the flesh, and that this removal has been effected by judgment coming upon him to the uttermost in the death of Christ. But in the very place where we see this solemn judgment of man in the flesh, we see the most wonderful display of divine love. We could not afford to be obliterated, if I may so say, anywhere else but in the presence of divine love. All that I am must go, but how does it go? It goes in a way which magnifies the love of Christ infinitely. There has been a complete condemnation of all that I am morally as a man in the flesh, but that condemnation has come about in the way of divine love -- it has come about in the death of Christ. Thus we get two things together of which the cross is the witness: the complete setting aside of all that we are in the flesh, and the introduction of the love of Christ as a new motive principle -- a new moral centre -- in the heart of the Christian. So that the Christian has a new standpoint from which to regard everything. He does not look at things from the point of view of the importance of self; the love of Christ is now his starting-point -- it is that which constrains him. In the presence of divine love we know our nothingness, and we can afford to 'pour contempt on all our pride'. When the love of the Christ is thus known in its constraining power, there is practical deliverance from all the weak and beggarly elements of legality which after all only retain self, and minister to the importance and satisfaction of the man who has gone for God.
{311}
Many souls go through years of exercise and self-disappointment in the vain effort to make the flesh suitable to God. There is a constant disposition with many to connect the blessings and grace of christianity with themselves as men and women in the flesh. And when, in the wisdom of God's ways with them, things come about which discover to them what the flesh really is -- that it is absolutely incapable of good, but infinite in capacity for evil -- they feel as if everything has gone from them. Without knowing it, such souls are looking for the grace of christianity to be added to the flesh, and they have to learn that this is impossible, for the flesh is incorrigibly bad. But it is a deep joy to discover that in the depths of self-disgust in which the soul has to cry, "O wretched man that I am!" (@Romans 7: 24), "I abhor myself ..." (@Job 42: 6), it comes for the first time into touch with the mind of God. And such a one would rejoice to be able to change his standpoint, and to look at things from the side of divine love. He would realise the necessity for the complete setting aside of the flesh. And he would then learn, as we have seen, that the flesh is set aside in the way of divine love, and that there is another Man before God, filling His eye and heart with unspeakable rest and satisfaction, and that the blessings and grace of christianity are all set forth in Him. He would then be prepared to understand what it is to be "of him ... in Christ Jesus, who has been made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and holiness, and redemption; that according as it is written, He that boasts, let him boast in the Lord" (@1 Corinthians 1: 30, 31).
We will now turn to a scripture in which the love of Christ as Sanctifier is brought before us. "For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make perfect the leader of their salvation through sufferings. For both he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying, I will
{312}
declare thy name to my brethren; in the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises" (@Hebrews 2: 10 - 12). Here we see another of those wondrous activities in which the love of Christ is known. He has become the Sanctifier that He might introduce His own to complete association with Himself, in a love which
<blockquote>'... gives not as the world, but shares <br>All it possesses with its loved co-heirs'. (`249:2)</blockquote>
It is the blessed thought of the love of Christ that His own should be "all of one" with Himself, and if our hearts are attracted by this love, there is no lack of power to bring us consciously into it.
In previous verses of this chapter we see how One who was above all creation has been made some little inferior to angels to accomplish the pleasure of God (verse 7). We see in Him a devotedness to God which took Him into death so that the grace of God might touch everything. To the end of verse 9 it is grace, but verses 10 - 12 are the thoughts of love. It is the pleasure of God to have "many sons" brought to glory. It is the pleasure of His love. I think every Christian has an instinctive sense of what glory is. It is that holy scene where divine love has its supreme satisfaction and rest. And God will have us there for His own delight, and He will have us there in perfect suitability to the place and to the affections which belong to the place. We are not going into glory as aliens or as an importation of another order, but as belonging to the place. We hear of African princes being presented to the Queen. There may be favour in it but there is no love, for they are not at home in the place to which they are introduced; they do not belong to the place. But God is bringing us to glory as those who belong to glory -- as "many sons". Divine love has measured all that was involved in this, all that was necessary to bring it about, and has accomplished it all. It is not only that grace has perfectly met our need and our
{313}
responsibility here, but divine love has given us an entirely new origin. The death of Christ is not only the end of everything that we were as in the flesh, but it is that from which we have derived our origin as a race who know the love of God. "Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, it abides alone; but if it die, it bears much fruit" (@John 12: 24). The fruit of the death of Christ is a race who know the love of God which has displayed itself in that death; it is a race begotten by the love of God. Christ has gone into death that He might be the Origin of a company deriving everything from Himself -- a company of "many sons" knowing the blessed and perfect love of God, and at home in that love. He thus secures a sanctified company, "all of one" with Himself, "for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren".
If Christ could not regard us apart from the flesh, He would be ashamed of us, but on the ground of His death He can regard us as entirely apart from it, and as deriving everything in new creation from Himself. As we appropriate His death we are able to regard ourselves as apart from the flesh, and it is thus that we enter into the true privilege of the assembly. For what glory will be actually, the assembly is morally. It is that wondrous circle where we are privileged to taste the blessedness of being associated with Christ in the presence of His God and Father. He has declared His Father's name to His brethren that we may enter into all the blessedness of the love which rests upon Him. "That the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them" (@John 17: 26).
Then, on the other hand, none but Himself could give a suited response to the love into which He has brought us. Hence He says, "In the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises" (@Hebrews 2: 12). He is the greater Praiser, but He has a company in harmony with Himself. The notes of His song vibrate in the hearts of His brethren. It is a wonderful thought of divine love that Christ should become the Centre
{314}
of a sanctified company capable of appreciating the Father's name, and capable of being in harmony with the song which only Christ can sing -- a song which is the suited and adequate response to all the fulness of the revelation of God. May God lead our hearts a little more into the profound blessedness of this!
Just a few words in conclusion on the scripture to which I alluded before, where the apostle prays that the saints might "know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge" (@Ephesians 3: 19). Three things are necessary in order that we may apprehend the whole scope of the Father's counsels. They are brought before us in the prayer of the apostle.
We must be strengthened with power by the Father's Spirit in the inner man; Christ must dwell in our hearts by faith; and we must be rooted and founded in love.
Then we can survey "the breadth and length and depth and height"; we can apprehend the infinite scope of those counsels which will have their eternal display in a universe of bliss of which Christ will be the Centre and Sun. But in that universe of bliss the assembly has her own peculiar and distinctive portion in the love of the Christ. She will be the satisfaction of His heart for ever, and His love will be her satisfaction and her inalienable portion. As the last Adam -- Head of the new creation -- Christ will have His assembly which He loved, and for which He gave Himself, to share His glory and to know how He finds His satisfaction in her. And Paul would have us to anticipate the glory -- to enter even while here into the peculiar distinction of the assembly -- to "know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge". As I said before, this is the consummation of blessing, the very crown of christianity. May God greatly affect our hearts by the consideration of it, and bring each one of us more under the present influence of the love of the Christ.

NOTES OF A READING @EPHESIANS 3: 20, 21; @EPHESIANS 4: 1 - 6
C.A.C. We need to cultivate a great sense of the power that works in us.
Rem. This is God working in us.
C.A.C. Yes, and the great thought seems to be the thought of power. "Strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man", and then "fully able" in verse 18, which supposes power. There is an immeasurable power working in the saints.
Ques. Would you say more about it?
C.A.C. Well, I do not seem able to say very much, but it is evident to us all that there is such a thing.
Rem. If we know ourselves naturally, we are not surprised at great power being needed to make it living in our hearts.
C.A.C. Yes, I suppose that this is the climax of what can be reached by divine power in the assembly, because this supposes an assembly setting of things. It is "the assembly in Christ Jesus" which is contemplated, so that all the saints are necessary to the thought. It is "with all the saints", as if it took the whole company of the saints to compass these things.
Ques. The power, is it an allusion to the Holy Spirit?
C.A.C. Yes, I suppose it is. It is "strengthened with power by his Spirit"; that is, the Father's Spirit.
Ques. Would you say something about "the assembly in Christ Jesus"?
C.A.C. Do you think that it looks at the assembly as seen entirely apart from the flesh -- from mixed conditions; that is, it is what subsists eternally? The assembly in Christ Jesus continues "unto all generations of the age of ages". It is the thought of the assembly divested of everything which it will not carry into eternity. We should be able to see it so.
{316}
It is possible to conceive of the assembly from that point of view. The assembly in Christ Jesus presents that to me. It is the assembly viewed according to the counsels of infinite love, and viewed as an entirely unmixed spiritual product of the work of God. Well, it needs strengthening to apprehend the thought. So there is nothing there but glory to God; it is, "To him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages"; that is, viewing the assembly in that light there is nothing there but the glory of God. I suppose we touch that when we are together -- even for a moment -- the blessedness of the condition of things brought about in the assembly where there is nothing but glory. It is something like the glory filling the house, is it not?
Rem. We get the city coming down out of heaven from God, having the glory of God, in Revelation.
C.A.C. It is wonderful to think of the vessel of divine glory; and that is simply what is, not what ought to be; and as we are strengthened to be enabled to enter into it, we should pray for power to enter into it when we are in assembly. It needs great power to enter into it. Then God would have His proper portion.
Rem. "In him is the yea, and in him the amen, for glory to God by us" (@2 Corinthians 1: 20).
C.A.C. Yes, and that you might say in a limited range -- the range of promise. I have been told that there are 30,000 promises in the Bible; they are all yea and amen in the Son of God. The assembly should be able to take up everything that God has given expression to in promise, so that God gets the glory of it.
But here it is an *unlimited* range. It shows us the immense variety of the rules of worship. We are apt to get in a groove, to get contracted in the way we express our worship. God would have us expand into the full range of promise, and then to expand into what belongs to His eternal purpose in Christ Jesus before the world was. If we
{317}
do not, the angels cannot! If we do not give Him the glory of it, He will not get it at all; is that not true?
It is a marvellous thought that there is a power working in us. We are poor things and cannot take it in, we may say, but what about this power? Does it not mean anything to us, or is it only a word in the Bible?
Rem. We did not, I think, refer last time to the words, "That ye may be filled even to all the fulness of God".
C.A.C. What had you in your mind as to it?
Rem. It seems a very remarkable statement -- a filling of the saints to enable the praise and glory to come out.
C.A.C. The fulness of God is, of course, of fathomless depth, but is that which is adequate to bring out all that God is morally and in the counsels of His love. It is not what He is in His being, but what He is in His fulness. It is an unlimited range of things. It used to be illustrated by a basket in an ocean. Well, the basket is in the ocean and the ocean in the basket.
Rem. I was thinking that the thought of glory must spring from resource. We must know something of those promises you mentioned, the knowledge of God and His riches. It does not spring from poverty.
C.A.C. Yes, surely, and the thing is there in power, not just in word.
Rem. Yes, it is not a flow of language, but something real and living, something that is vital.
C.A.C. And the power *does* work in the saints; it is a great thing to recognise that. Sometimes we are on the line we wish it would. The assembly is the vessel in which the power of God works, so that there may be an apprehension of God in His great thoughts of love, and particularly manward -- as men, and not angels, may know Him.
Ques. Is it more operative when the saints are convened?
C.A.C. I think so. I do not see how we can in a practical sense touch assembly conditions except as
{318}
together.
Rem. There is a warning as to "forsaking the assembling of yourselves together" (@Hebrews 10: 25).
C.A.C. Yes, I think we should look for a working of divine power when saints are together that you cannot get privately. Power working in two is more than in one; there is an accession of power. So that we should look more for this. We must admit that there is not always the power there might be. Well, that raises the question, Have we got the faith of this power working in the assembly so that God may be really known, so that this glory that is due to Him may flow richly in the assembly? I think it must be collectively, in the assembly.
Rem. It speaks of the love of the Christ, the fulness and the glory in these verses. Are they progressive thoughts?
C.A.C. Is there not a certain outline given for when the assembly is convened? Christ dwells in the affections of all, that is the first product. Well, I think we come to that through the Supper. Then there is the rooting and founding in love, and the apprehension of the breadth and length and depth and height (that is, the vast universe of bliss, as we speak); then the Centre of it in the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge; then "filled even to all the fulness of God". It seems to be an ascending climax. I suppose these things would be a matter of prayer all the time; that is, this is a perpetual prayer which I think we can realise in some small way in observing how the saints function in the assembly. There has been a certain development of these things and it is going on, and will go on right into eternity.
Ques. The expression, "Unto all generations", would it be connected with every family?
C.A.C. I think it is about the fullest expression of eternity that we have, is it not?
Rem. It is very uncommon -- "the age of ages" -- and I think unique. Generally "the age of ages" is used to
{319}
emphasise the greatness of the eternal state. No age is comparable to it.
C.A.C. We say sometimes, 'Eternity's begun', and perhaps for a moment we realise it.
Ques. Is there a sense of glory to God in the state of the assembly? There is a perfection in it that is glory to God, it has such excellence as wrought of God.
C.A.C. Yes, and it supposes, of course, the answer to the prayer: that which has gone before has been answered. Well, it is very marvellous that it is in the light of all this that we are to take up our relations with one another as brethren. We are to walk in the light of all this. Persons who have been made so great in relation to God would not have much difficulty in exercising meekness and lowliness and forbearance.
Rem. That would enable the apostle to speak of himself as "the prisoner".
C.A.C. Yes, it is very affecting. You have suddenly dropped down into prison, intimating that the actual conditions in which saints are found may be very straitened. It is a setting forth of the actual condition in which the testimony is found.
Rem. The two sides presented are sometimes a difficulty to us practically.
C.A.C. Well, I suppose we are really put to school to learn how to do it, are we not?
Rem. We have had such good times for so long that we find the pressure side difficult.
C.A.C. We find that things have to be worked out in a practical way in circumstances of trial and in contact with the brethren, who test us. We are tested by the brethren, but it is to bring out the divine formation.
Rem. The children of Israel had a great prospect too before them, but when they were tested it brought out rebellion. We sometimes find it difficult to be in the good of our calling.
{320}
C.A.C. Well, it is designedly brought in after this wonderful unfolding of divine power and what it can do for us in this spiritual realm. Then we are set along with the brethren where these qualities are needed, "lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, bearing with one another in love". It is not the world here; these qualities are to come out when we are with the brethren. As placed among the brethren, we are "to keep the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace". I think we should stand the test very well if we got the good of chapter 3.
Rem. We should have a sense of wealth, so that the creditor should release his hand, as you remarked when we were reading @Deuteronomy 15: 2.
C.A.C. There is no spirit of exacting. If we are in the spirit of demand, wanting every penny, it is not like God -- that is all. And these are inward qualities: meekness etc. It is not simply that we do not say anything though we are boiling inside!
Rem. I think that is important, because a man in the world can do that if he has self-control.
C.A.C. I think we do not ourselves get much beyond a little of that sometimes, and pat ourselves on the back for it! But the thought is that the inwardness of the saints is right, not just that things are restrained. There is the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace. It suggests that it needs a certain application.
Rem. We are never shut out from exercise anywhere.
C.A.C. The unity of the Spirit is a subsisting reality, and we are to endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace; so the spirit of contention has no place.
Rem. "I am meek and lowly in heart" showed His inwardness. It is the only reference to His own heart that the Lord made. If these are there, the testing will only bring them out.
C.A.C. Well, if we get on so well together Godward
{321}
in chapter 3, correspondingly with that is how we get on together in the working of it out practically amongst ourselves.
Rem. It is not much use speaking of the one, what we enjoy, etc., if the outward and practical side is all wrong and does not answer to it.
C.A.C. Yes, the thing is marred, is it not?
{322}
NOTES OF A READING @EPHESIANS 4: 4 - 12 (1ST CLAUSE)
C.A.C. I suppose the calling referred to in verse 1 would refer to what he had spoken of at the end of chapter 2. That is, we get the thought of the one body and one Spirit. But this great truth is to be worked out in conditions of imperfection.
Ques. Is that why we get the earlier verses of chapter 4?
C.A.C. I thought so, the necessity for lowliness, meekness and forbearance, etc. It always suggests an imperfect condition of things and that is how we are tested. If the saints were altogether perfect, we should not have to exercise long-suffering in relation to them or bear with them. So that the unity of the Spirit should be worked out in spite of everything that would hinder it.
Rem. And it is an exercise that devolves upon us all, every one.
C.A.C. I think so. Each has to see that he or she does not bring in something contrary to the unity of the Spirit. There are all kinds of things that militate against this wonderful truth of unity: our natural proclivities, temperaments, etc. Satan is behind this, for God is after the unity, for "there is one body, and one Spirit". I think it means a good deal of self-denial for every one of us.
Rem. We are inclined to expect more consideration from our brethren than we are to give it.
C.A.C. We are all naturally characterised by self-concern and self-importance in some degree, but they are foreign elements and we are to walk worthy of the calling.
Ques. Would you link up the calling with chapter 2?
C.A.C. I thought all was connected. It speaks of the one new man and the one body, and access by one Spirit to the Father, and brings in the fellow-citizenship of the saints,
{323}
and being "built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets", etc. -- all seems bound up in the thought of the calling, and we are to walk worthy of it.
We have often been reminded of the parenthesis in chapter 3, so the beginning of chapter 4 really links on with the end of chapter 2; and if we kept these great and wondrous thoughts of God before us, we should feel there was a great and worthy object to pursue.
And those are subsisting facts: the one body and one Spirit. They are great divine subsisting realities. It implies that there is ability in the saints viewed spiritually to work in a perfectly harmonious way with one another. We are competent to walk in perfect harmony as members of the one body and as energised by the one Spirit. People would tell you that it is a beautiful conception, but impracticable. But then we ought to confess that it is a possibility, and that there is competence in the saints for it, if they would but recognise it; so that all friction is eliminated. It would be a wonderful sight to see fifty people walking together in the truth of this, a wonderful thing in the sight of heaven.
Ques. Is this what is pictured in @Isaiah 11? "The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb", etc.
C.A.C. Well, that is very good, because I think those features very aptly describe us naturally -- "hateful, and hating one another" (@Titus 3: 3). Fancy God taking up creatures of that character, so that they harmonise in the one body! The whole of christendom says it cannot be done. Well, God says it can be done. Which side are we to take? It comes to that, does it not?
Rem. A little child leads them.
C.A.C. If I am meek and lowly, I shall not bring in any grit. As to awkward people who do bring in grit, well then with them we must forbear; we must exercise forbearance with those as contrary. We have very little idea of how wonderful the body is.
Some years ago a brother visiting remarked, 'The saints
{324}
in T. do not understand the body'. Still that is no reason why we should not make a beginning, is it? If we only accepted that we are in this matter, what a difference it would make in all our lives, our way of speaking of the brethren, and in our practical walk. I believe fifty people being in the light of this would shake the world.
Rem. People often say how difficult it is to control matters and make them work.
C.A.C. And particularly for want of material! Wise men put out wonderful theories, but there is no material. The greatest reality in the world today is the body. All is to work harmoniously, that is the conception. We want the love of it and the faith of it. It has pleased God to break up the thing in small pieces, locally, so that it should be known all over the world. It all hangs on the fact that the Lord took a body Himself; He took a vessel prepared. And now He has set the saints together in one body, so that all that is of Himself should be expressed. If we really entered into it, it would give us sleepless nights, and then we should get up in the morning and try to work it out!
Rem. And it should be recognised by all.
C.A.C. That is, it is a substantial thing. The thought of the body was wonderfully expressed when the Holy Spirit came down at the baptism, to become tangible in Jesus. So in the saints He becomes tangible in His operations. That is the conception, this uniting bond is peace. It is not exactly from this point of view that the Spirit is the bond, or even the body, but the uniting bond is peace. We are to be set in peace with all the brethren. There is to be no friction between any brother or sister; I take it that is what is meant. So that the Jew and the Gentile, the most contrary elements in the world, are made one. So here it is the thought of the saints moving together and resisting every element contrary to peace in our spirits. I feel what a great undertaking it is.
Rem. The note in the Darby translation to verse 3 is good: 'It is not only "bond" but the "bond-together". It is
{325}
not the power of union -- that is the Holy Spirit; but the practical uniting in fact, as amongst men on earth'.
C.A.C. That is very helpful, and confirms what has been said. It is no good to speak of one body and one Spirit if I am out at elbows with my neighbour!
The Lord said to His disciples in @Luke 10, You ask if the son of peace is there; if not, do not go in where the son of peace is not, you will regret it if you do. It is very practical advice for us. It is disregard of this wonderful teaching that has brought christendom to where it is. All the sects etc. have grown out of disregard of this chapter.
Ques. What is the hope of the calling? "One hope".
C.A.C. Well, I suppose in the teaching of this epistle it is the heading up of everything in Christ, that God is going to head up all things in the heavens and upon the earth in Christ. We have the thought before us as a matter of hope, that all is going to be gathered up and centred in Christ. Well, the only family that finds its centre there at the present time is the assembly.
Ques. There is great emphasis on "one" in this chapter; "One Lord, one faith, one baptism", etc., emphasising, would you say, the general oneness of things marking the whole dispensation?
C.A.C. Yes, I think so. It has often been said that the unity really depends on God being one, so we get one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father. There is one Spirit, i.e. the inward thought, it is a purely spiritual thought. And then there is a circle where there is one Lord, which takes in the whole of the profession -- one faith and one baptism. And then there is a wider thought still -- one God and Father, etc. It is the widest thought possible and takes in all mankind.
Ques. Does "in us all" refer to believers?
C.A.C. "In us all", yes, I thought so. There is the wide scope of relations in which God stands to all, but He is only in the saints.
{326}
Ques. In what way would you say it is true of the saints, "in us all"?
C.A.C. I suppose in view of the Spirit and the divine nature, God is in us. "He that abides in love abides in God, and God in him", John says (@1 John 4: 16).
Ques. What is the force of "through all"?
C.A.C. Well, I suppose there are operations of God through all men; He operates in some way through all men.
All men have a knowledge of good and evil and all have consciences, and there are divine operations. Every man has a spirit in relation to God. His natural spirit as a man came from God, and He operates by way of good and evil, and conscience. He operates through all; all creatures are taken into the field of His operation; that is, God has not given up His relations with all men; men have given Him up, but He has not given them up. There are operations of God going on through all men. Of course, the solemn thing is that men refuse these operations of God and trample them under foot. His Spirit is pleading too, and He says, "My Spirit shall not always plead with Man" (@Genesis 6: 3).
Ques. In what way is God the Father of all? He is not universally Father?
C.A.C. No, men have gone astray in that thought. God is Father of all in a creatorial sense; all men got their spirits from God, we all come from God. The universal fatherhood of God is the terrible fallacy that all men are the children of God without redemption. But they are not truly so without conversion and the divine nature. Still there is the universal fatherhood in a creatorial sense.
Of course, in preaching, men are addressed as responsible creatures of God, and any preacher should have a sense of the greatness of men, for they are creatures of God; the fall does not take away that fact. James says, you "curse ... men made after the likeness of God" (chapter 3: 9), and he is representative in that likeness now. Of course it is a sad thing if he dishonours it.
{327}
Rem. Even, it is said, the young lions cry to Him, and man is on a higher plane.
C.A.C. It is very striking that God should look upon the brute creation in relation to Him. "He giveth ... to the young ravens which cry" (@Psalm 147:9).
Rem. It says of the lower creatures, "The young lions ... seek their food from God" (@Psalm 104: 21).
Ques. Why is it brought out here in this epistle?
C.A.C. Is it not in connection with the greatness of the calling? We stand in relation to God who is so great, and great in His operations. So that all this wonderful truth should characterise the saints, and there are adequate supplies to work it out. "To each one of us has been given grace according to the measure of the gift of the Christ". So every believer has a supply to work out these things in a practical way, so it is no use saying we have not. "To each one of us".
Ques. The gifts given are for that?
C.A.C. But the grace is given to each one; the gifts are a speciality, but then they are for all the saints.
Ques. "According to the measure of the gift of the Christ": what is the meaning?
C.A.C. Well, I think it means grace adequate for the working out of the matter in hand. It is not a wonderful picture merely, but to be worked out. "One Lord, one faith, one baptism", etc. How is it to be done? Well, "Unto each one of us has been given grace according to the measure of the gift of the Christ", so it is illimitable. It might be rendered, 'the beneficence of the Christ', so it is according to the largeness of His grace. The object of the gifts is that the saints may be perfected. The grace given in measure is measureless.
These gifts are furnished from above the highest point in the universe that the saints may grow up to the full measure of the thought of God. This chapter is full of the most wonderful conceptions. These things are to be worked out
{328}
by the power of the grace that comes from Christ, not naturally. The gifts come in to help us in an external way, if that is to be understood. The gifts are received "in Man" (@Psalm 68: 18), in that order of being; of course in the Person of the ascended Christ, and so they are for man.
The gifts reach out to all men. They are external helps; the grace is supplied within. They help us by bringing us something that we should not otherwise have known; so we become intelligent and perfected. So many saints are dwarfed and stunted in their growth today, because they do not get the benefit of the ministry and what it brings.
{329}
NOTES OF A READING @EPHESIANS 4: 10 - 16
Ques. Is the ascent of Christ the measure of the descent in a certain sense, no one could have gone higher? "He that descended is the same who has also ascended". Why is it put that way?
C.A.C. Well, these great movements are to be considered. Do both refer to Him as Man?
Ques. Do you think that "He that descended is the same" shows that there might be a question as to whether it was as Man on both occasions?
C.A.C. Yes, it seems to be His own act in each case; "He ... descended" does not seem to have in view exactly His incarnation; His descending movement as Man would cover His death and burial. It is striking it is "the lower parts of the earth", referring to His burial.
Rem. "My bones were not hidden from thee when I was made in secret, curiously wrought in the lower parts of the earth" (@Psalm 139: 15).
C.A.C. He has been in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
Rem. In that way the death and burial of Christ are linked together.
C.A.C. The full depth of His descent is brought out in His burial.
Ques. The object of His descent was that He might fill all things?
C.A.C. Does that not show what was in the mind of God in it all? He is going to fill all things in the power of what is brought about in His descent and ascent. There is not a spot in the moral universe where He has not been. He has been found in every spot between the dust of death and the place where He is as ascended up above all heavens.
Rem. So that God will never see anything empty again.
{330}
C.A.C. That is a very beautiful thought, and would you say that the assembly is the first circle to be filled? That would involve that the assembly is a wonderful vessel. We were seeing earlier in this epistle there is to be glory to God in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages, and we can understand the assembly being filled.
Ques. Filled with what?
C.A.C. Well, filled with what is exactly the opposite to all those powers that needed to be led captive. Would not the thought suggest that there are hostile powers which are found in that scene but are all met? All those powers that have brought God's creature into captivity are all overcome and dispossessed, so that Christ takes the place of every power hostile to God and is able to fill the universe with what is of God. It is a most wonderful scope of things. Great powers have been active in God's created universe which are contrary to God, and men particularly have come under the power of those forces of evil. We have been under their power, but here is a blessed Person able to go to the highest and lowest points to overthrow those powers and fill all to the pleasure of God.
Rem. The woman in @John 4 is an illustration, "If thou knewest the gift of God", etc.
C.A.C. That is how we must all begin, surely. We have heard it was the power of corrupted affections which held her, so that she could not possibly be a worshipper, but the Lord could free her from that to know God and become a worshipper. She becomes a waterpot with a spring in it never known before; it will never be empty.
It is very striking that this should be linked up with the giving of gifts, as if the divine intent was that all this should be brought into the hearts of men by means of gifts.
Ques. Is the idea that He has removed the bondage of the old man and set man up in riches through gift?
C.A.C. And the thought of gift would link itself with
{331}
what we were saying, "If thou knewest the gift of God" -- the word used to speak of the munificence of a king. And Christ has received certain gifts as the ascended Man that they might be dispensed, all having in view the enrichment of man, his enrichment in the great thoughts of God, not only evil powers displaced but all that is blessed brought in and made the positive substance of man.
Ques. What would be "the gift of the Christ"?
C.A.C. I think we were saying before that we thought the gift of the Christ, of the grace of Christ to each one, would help us to work out the earlier verses of the chapter. The truth of the body is to be worked out in unfavourable conditions, so that meekness, etc., is required. The gifts are external, but the grace given is what works in particular members to enable us to correlate with one another notwithstanding the difficulties. When you come to these great gifts of the ascended Christ they are external; the end in view is that they act to the edifying of the body of Christ, so that each of these gifts is a remarkable enrichment to us, from the ascended Christ towards the body, bringing something of the fulness of the ascended Christ. So that there is the power of the ascended Christ in each of these gifts, whether apostle, evangelist, shepherd, etc. They are an expression of the power of the ascended Christ, so that, as I understand it, there is power in the exercise of these gifts to subdue the hostile powers that are amongst us. The evangelist comes along and the power of all these influences is broken, and by the power of a gift from the ascended Christ. It is by the power of an ascended Christ because, I suppose, that is not quite His headship.
Ques. Can we preach the gospel without reference to the death and burial of Christ (verses 9, 10).
C.A.C. No, but you might have a very good preaching without literal reference to it. For instance, Paul gave a very good address at Athens, but he did not introduce the gospel into his preaching at all, but that God commandeth men to
{332}
repent, and he just mentions the resurrection. He did not preach the gospel, yet it led to the conversion of several interesting people.
I was thinking that here it was rather the immense distinction of Christ as the One who had died and ascended to the highest point, and it is as this Person that He receives gifts and dispenses them. It is an immense range of power, it seems to me. I do not know that we connect power with His headship. These gifts are positive power. Any babe could preach Christ, but then the gift is effective; Christ is so preached that everything is broken down in the soul and room made for Christ in all His saving power -- but it is effective. I think the gifts are the evidence of Christ's victory, and certain gifts operate as the agents of that power. For instance, "These men that have set the world in tumult, are come here also" (@Acts 17: 6). It had overturned idolatry, the whole Roman empire and the philosophical system; it was *done* through that power! We have little idea of the power of the gifts. What an extraordinary result there was from the apostle's labours. The apostle John was the only one who died a natural death, yet they overturned the world. Everyone in the prison at Philippi was convicted on the spot, they did not try to escape. The power goes through. An evangelist comes and people are delivered out of the world system, and that is effected by the gifts. And wonderful things are effected among the saints by the prophetic ministry. It is not so obvious but it is the same kind of thing; something is standing in the way and the prophetic word touches it, goes right home, and a divine element is brought in so that there is a change in the constitution of the saints. It is going on all the time, something is actually *done*; it is not merely a means of comfort. It is going on in obscure conditions, but that does not make it any less the power of the ascended Christ.
Rem. The test is the result, not what is said.
C.A.C. All is for the perfecting of the saints. This
{333}
whole operation of power from the highest point in the universe is going on for the perfecting of the saints; that is the idea.
Rem. It seems as if a man could not teach unless he were a shepherd.
C.A.C. I think that is right. A shepherd has a knowledge of souls and the needs of souls; that has to be met and is a matter of shepherd care.
Ques. Is "the perfecting of the saints" the idea of completing?
C.A.C. The perfecting of the saints would seem to imply that there is nothing left to hinder the normal working of the body. The work of the ministry is the service that would be going on continually in the body, not so much the ministry of gift but the mutual working in the body so that no element is left unfinished; there is nothing to hinder the service that goes on normally in the body.
Rem. The evangelist brings in the material.
Ques. The work of the ministry would be the normal activity among the saints?
C.A.C. I thought so. If the saints were all perfected, the mutual service would suffice for the edifying of the body. I think the reason for the gifts is to make us independent of them. So the gifts have in view a condition that will never actually be reached on earth, a wonderful end that will never be reached. The gifts are that nothing should hinder the harmonious working of the body. Every member of my body serves every other member, so as the saints are perfected every member is set free to serve every other member -- a wonderful ministry that goes on in the body itself. We get lost in these great things.

NOTES OF A READING @EPHESIANS 4: 11 - 16
C.A.C. It would help us if we kept distinctly before us that the object that God has in view, what He is working for, is not only for the future, i.e. not just for heaven, but to be aimed at as a definite object while the saints are here on earth. For it is clear from verse 13 that it is to be reached now.
Rem. This is the time of growth. "The full-grown man", it speaks of in verse 13, so it is for now.
C.A.C. That is in contrast with the babe state in the next verse.
Ques. Would you say more about arriving at "the knowledge of the Son of God"?
C.A.C. I suppose there is nothing beyond what is set forth in the Son of God. The full revelation of God is there and the full answer to it in Man.
Rem. There is also "the unity of the faith".
C.A.C. There is much that enters into "the faith". I suppose all that is the subject of faith is included in that, but the Centre of the circle is the Son of God.
Ques. Is "the faith" the full light of christianity?
C.A.C. Yes. I think every element of "the faith" is there.
Ques. Is the idea of "the unity of the faith" that every part of it is entertained and the saints are intelligently in it?
C.A.C. It is one whole, so it is indivisible faith. And all the saints are to arrive at it by means of gift, by ministry and by the edifying of the body. "Until we all arrive" -- that all the saints may arrive at it. It is outside the whole range of human opinion, I thought, and the thought associated with it is that finality is reached on God's part in His Son.
Ques. I suppose the "full-grown man" is a collective thought?
{335}
C.A.C. Surely. The "full-grown man" views the saints collectively as having arrived at maturity of intelligence. The thought of the wife in the next chapter views the saints more from the side of affection; but this is a masculine thought, is it not? Paul had in mind that many evil teachings were about; "unprincipled cunning" and "systematized error" marked the conditions in the world: not only do men gratify their own lusts and seek their own pleasure in a fleshly way, but Satan is all the time working to bring in error in all those things relating to God, so that a "full-grown man" is needed to escape these things.
Rem. It is very strong language, "unprincipled cunning" and "systematized error", things which abound more than ever.
C.A.C. Yes, indeed; so that the saints need maturity, they need the apprehension of "the fulness of the Christ".
Ques. Would "the fulness of the Christ" refer more to all that has come out in connection with Christ in this epistle, more personally, I mean?
C.A.C. I thought so.
Ques. I suppose the great bulk of Christians are "driven about" and lack maturity?
C.A.C. All this shows the importance of ministry, as all this is looked at as the result of ministry, showing the importance of these things being maintained in the ministry -- "the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God" and "the fulness of the Christ" -- so that the saints are kept in the presence of these wonderful things.
Ques. I suppose we are only preserved when in the living enjoyment of the truth?
C.A.C. Yes, and then all these systems of error are seen to be utterly worthless. What do they give us? They give us nothing.
Ques. Does it suggest that God has certain thoughts of His saints collectively down here, a sort of final development that is His ideal, if I might so say, and He is
{336}
working to bring them to His ideal?
C.A.C. Yes, indeed; so that we look for increase of stature, do we not? It has often been said that the body is looked at as complete at any particular time; that is not to say that it cannot increase. This is the divine ideal in relation to the body as a whole, and each individual assembly should be manifestly marked by increase. The saints who are gone are out of it. The saints who have departed have ceased to function as members of the body; so it is for us who still remain to see that this increase goes on normally, i.e. bodywise. We want it not only with two or three members, but we want uniform development all round. One member showing marked increase is not the divine ideal; one side of a body increasing only may be a monstrosity.
Ques. "The fulness of the Christ", does it suggest the assembly being the fulness of the Christ?
C.A.C. You mean there is the thought of the assembly coming up to the measure?
Ques. Is it God's thought of what the assembly should arrive at; and we are to come up to that measure? It is our exercise.
C.A.C. Yes. We can all recognise verse 14 as being in evidence, this false teaching, but then there is something going on that is exactly opposite to that on God's part, the saints being enlarged in the apprehension of all according to God in its maturity and finality, for it is finality in the Son of God. There is no development beyond that.
Rem. Men see there is something wrong and try to put it right by system, which is mechanical and not vital.
C.A.C. So that the very system becomes "systematized error".
Rem. The two points you referred to, the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God, would establish us.
C.A.C. I think we are more familiar with the wifely
{337}
thought than with the full-grown man. The Lord refers in @John 17: 6 to "the men whom thou gavest me". John refers to the bride more than any other, but there is also this masculine thought, the assembly viewed as having ability to hold divine thoughts as set forth in the Son of God, in God and in Christ. And this is to be held in love, it is not a system of theology.
Ques. Would "the truth" there be a comprehensive thought?
C.A.C. Yes.
Rem. It would be almost synonymous with "the faith": "Building yourselves up on your most holy faith" (@Jude 20).
Ques. "Holding the truth in love", what does that mean?
C.A.C. He speaks in verse 18 of certain persons who are "estranged from the life of God". It has been said that is 'love in activity', and it is really in the divine nature that the truth can be spiritually held, in a nature kindred with God.
Ques. Is that why Paul breaks off in a kind of parenthesis in the great chapter of love in Corinthians?
C.A.C. Yes, it is what gives vitality to things; truth without love is very cold and barren.
Ques. Would you say that the people in "systematized error" know anything of the faith?
C.A.C. I should say they were enemies of the faith!
Rem. Verses 13 and 15 would show this chapter is for setting forth things in love and intelligence; we have been a bit lopsided in them.
C.A.C. The great point here is growing, "We may grow up to him in all things, who is the head, the Christ: from whom the whole body, fitted together, and connected by every joint of supply, according to the working in its measure of each one part, works for itself the increase of the body to its self-building up in love", which brings us
{338}
back to the divine nature. Why should it say, "In all things"? What should we understand by the "all things" referred to? I should like to have some clear thought with regard to it.
Rem. It is characteristic of this epistle, the comprehensiveness of it. The unity of the faith would imply that nothing can be omitted, everything must be held. We sometimes think detail unimportant.
C.A.C. Yes, I think that helps, and he says about every joint of supply that it is "according to the working in its measure of each one part". It is the body viewed as acting through many joints and parts, is it not?
Ques. Does it suggest equal growth of a perfectly formed body?
C.A.C. Well, that seems to be the thought, and in all things there is a growing up to Christ as the Head; increasing room is left for the headship of Christ. It is not exactly the thought of the Spirit in this scripture. In Corinthians the Spirit is made much of; here it is every single member in the body coming into the apprehension of Christ as Head, so that the Head comes into prominence in the way the body is working. So it is a spiritual advance on @1 Corinthians 12, the Spirit being prominent there, and the body learning to function by the Spirit. So there is a spiritual functioning in relation to the Spirit. But this would seem to be a functioning in relation to the Head.
Rem. So that our development is on that line, in relation to Him as that, each member being conscious of being linked with Him.
C.A.C. In the distribution of the Spirit we find great variety, to one is given one thing and to another that. The variety is emphasised of the distribution that lies in the power of the Spirit, but here it is more bringing all to one Centre, the centralising rather than the distributing aspect. It is helpful to distinguish between functioning in relation to the Spirit and in relation to the Head. Do you think we
{339}
ought to know *when* we change from the Spirit to the Head? I think one can see that we are on a higher level in Ephesians than when viewed in the Corinthian point of view, where the Spirit is prominent to set aside what is of the flesh and of the mind of man. But everything growing up to Christ in the body, every member learning to function in relation to Christ, in relation to a glorified Man in heaven, is a wonderful thing. Well, that is a very great thought. It is not the Spirit exactly operating in one or two distinguished members, but the whole body moving together. "The whole body, fitted together, ... works for itself the increase of the body to its self-building up in love". It is the whole christian company viewed as the body functioning in relation to Christ as Head, so that every joint of supply can draw from Him. Joints of supply are not gifts, they are in the body, and sisters can be joints of supply. All draw from Christ in heaven. The point is, are *we* drawing from Him? I believe He is extremely ready to be drawn from. The woman in the gospel only needed to *touch* the hem of His garment. Well, can we touch Him? We are all in it, for sisters too can be drawing from Christ as Head. So there is a power of self-building up in love that is even greater than the action of gifts.
{340}
NOTES OF A READING @EPHESIANS 4: 17 - 24
C.A.C. I was struck in reading to observe how the mind and the understanding have a very important place. It speaks of the nations as walking in "the vanity of their mind, being darkened in understanding" and then, "by reason of the ignorance which is in them". It seems to suggest the importance of the *mind* being right.
Rem. "Being renewed in the spirit of your mind", we get further on.
C.A.C. I was thinking of it in connection with @Romans 1: 21, 22 where he says of men that they "fell into folly in their thoughts, and their heart without understanding was darkened: professing themselves to be wise they became fools", and so on. It seems that a wrong state of mind in reference to God is what leads to the vile lusts which degrade and dishonour man. This position comes about by not thinking right; is that not important to notice?
Ques. Attention has been drawn to the mind, has it not?
C.A.C. Yes, it is a most important part of man, his mind, and most important that as saints we should think rightly. Paul says to the Athenians, "We ought not to think that which is divine to be like gold or silver or stone, the graven form of man's art and imagination" (@Acts 17: 29). It is a degrading thought.
Rem. The heart is connected with the mind both in this passage and in Romans, and as a man "thinketh in his heart, so is he" (@Proverbs 23: 7, Authorised Version); they are linked together.
C.A.C. The heathen world was given up to uncleanness -- "vile lusts" -- but it began by having wrong thoughts about God.
Rem. It is the work of Satan to darken and blind the
{341}
thoughts of men.
C.A.C. Yes, indeed, so that it is most important for us that we see to it that we think rightly, and if our thoughts were governed by Scripture, we should do so. How do we think? It is a most important matter. We walk and speak wrongly because we think wrongly. If the thoughts could be put right, all would be right. So that one great blessing of the new covenant is that right thoughts are put into the mind.
Ques. The law is put in the man's mind in @Romans 7; would that be the desire to do right, but he had not the power?
C.A.C. Well, but he had got nicely started on the road to it! If the mind is right and the thoughts are right, then a law is set up inwardly in the mind and he will never be happy until he can work it out. Nothing makes a man more wretched than having a divine principle set up in his mind which he cannot work out practically. No wonder he says, "O wretched man that I am!" So he sums it up at the end of the chapter, "So then *I myself* with the mind serve God's law; but with the flesh sin's law". So that that has the upper hand. He says here, "estranged from the life of God by reason of the ignorance which is in them".
Ques. Does the expression "life of God" mean life characterised by the knowledge of God?
C.A.C. It is one of the remarkable expressions of Scripture. The life of God is the activity of love. If we are really enlightened as to God, and our natural ignorance removed, and light has come into the mind, we see that the life of God is love in activity. Really the life of God is to be the life of the saints; we are to be on happy terms with it, as those on the same lines.
Rem. It says that the apostles were to "speak in the temple ... all the words of this life" (@Acts 5: 20).
C.A.C. Yes, it was not all the words of 'this doctrine', but of "this life". So that christianity is described in the
{342}
Acts by a very suggestive term, now disappeared out of use and rarely alluded to, though I do not know why. It is repeatedly called "the way", which signifies that certain persons are moving together in a certain way.
If we really understood that the life of God was the activity of love, we should see what a degrading thing it is to be governed by selfishness and self-gratification; so that we should be prepared to cast it aside as an unworthy life, unworthy of creatures of God.
Ques. Does the apostle bring these debasing things in as a contrast to all that is of God? "But *ye* have not thus learnt the Christ".
C.A.C. Yes, it is really the dark background which sets off in a very wonderful way the contrast. There are persons who have learnt the Christ, it is still a question of the mind. Christ is a Person to be learnt. It is in the mind that we learn the Christ.
Ques. Would you say how the mind can take in divine thoughts? We have always been afraid of it.
C.A.C. Well, there is, as we know, the utter inability of the natural mind, or the mind of the flesh, to entertain what is of God, but still man as a creature is an intelligent being; he has a mind. And God intends that man shall be recovered in his mind. Romans speaks of the "renewing of the mind", showing that the mind is not discarded, it is renewed. The mind determines a very great deal.
Ques. The mind of the flesh -- is that something rather different from the natural mind and intelligence?
C.A.C. Yes, I think according to the flesh the mind is corrupted and comes under vitiating principles that incapacitate it for receiving. But when God comes in in new birth, that process affects the whole man, his mind and heart and will; there is a new beginning on a new principle altogether.
Ques. Would "the spirit of your mind" be the intent of the mind?
{343}
C.A.C. I think it is a remarkable expression, "The spirit of your mind". You might have your mind renewed and not have the spirit of your mind renewed. To illustrate it, when James and John wanted to call down fire on the villages that would not receive Christ, their mind was right. It was a very good mind that desired that every village should receive Christ; but the spirit of their mind was not right. They had not had their spirit adjusted according to Christ. If they had learnt from His Spirit, their spirits would have been renewed and they would not have thought of burning people up.
I think it is most important about the spirit of the mind. You may find yourself saying something perhaps right, but you are not saying it in the right spirit.
It is a question here of learning the Christ, and hearing Him, and being instructed in Him; it all has to do with the mind. We have to be instructed, so that we learn from Christ how to think. And then the matter of communications, what we are saying to one another this afternoon, is by the mind; it is the organ of reception.
It is wonderful that he suggests that the saints have heard Christ. They certainly had not heard Him in the days of His flesh; these Ephesians lived far from Palestine. There is such a thing as saints hearing Christ.
Ques. Is that how they came to a knowledge of the life of God, by learning from Christ?
C.A.C. I thought so. Then there is the precious thought that Christ is still speaking. There is a moment in the history of the soul when the voice of Christ is heard for the first time -- not sermons, or christian teaching, etc., but something quite new breaks into the soul, what J.N.D. describes as a 'powerful, mighty Voice, so near', calling from earth apart, and in tones of solemn sweetness captivating the heart. To hear His voice is a wonderful thing, and it is heard just as surely as Paul heard it from heaven.
{344}
Rem. It says, "And, coming, he has preached the glad tidings of peace to you who were afar off, and the glad tidings of peace to those who were nigh" (@Ephesians 2: 17).
C.A.C. Yes. It shows that Christ is teaching and speaking, and what He has to say refers to what has been set forth in Himself as here on earth -- "As the truth is in Jesus"; that is what He has to say. What is set forth "in Jesus" really, so He is made to stand forth very distinctively. It has to do more particularly with His death, because it has principally to do with putting off the old man and putting on the new. And it was set forth in Him -- it is wonderful.
Rem. And not in the cross.
C.A.C. Well, it is better than that when we see it. It is wonderful that God should teach us "in Jesus". The putting off of the old man and the putting on of the new man is "in Jesus"; whether we understand it or not, that is what it says.
Ques. You connect that with "instructed in him", how He moved here in this scene?
C.A.C. Well, I think so. All the instruction that is worth having is set forth in Christ; and amongst other things the putting off the old man is set forth in Him. When He was on the cross He was there representatively; all that made up the constitution, and character, and history of the old man was brought before God so that it might be condemned when He was on the cross. The whole thing was there representatively before God; so that when He laid down His life in the flesh that was put off. He was there on the cross that it might be condemned and it was put off never to be resumed again.
It is the same teaching as @Romans 6, but looked at in a fully developed manner, so that all the features and characteristics of the old man were before God for judgment when He hung on the cross. Then when He was buried that was definitely put off, never to be resumed, and the new man is patterned in Jesus raised from the dead.
{345}
Ques. So that all for the believer is established on resurrection ground?
C.A.C. We see it patterned in Jesus, not that He was ever the old man or the new man, but the thing was exemplified in Him.
Having apprehended it as set forth in Jesus, we see that there is absolutely nothing for it but the putting off of the old man and the putting on of the new; and the Christian is accredited as having done it, and having come into the great result that has been set forth in Jesus. If we have not done it we could hardly be said to be Christians, could we?
Rem. Features of the old man are seen in us as well, though, in practice.
C.A.C. This scripture would regard that as ignorance, if we retain some features of the old man. This instruction is like the school books; it has to be taken in. It will then make a tremendous difference to, and will effect a revolution in, the constitution of the person who takes it in.
The power of it is in seeing it in Jesus; and He is called here (the only time, I believe, that He is so spoken of), '*the* Jesus' (according to the footnote in the Darby translation), as if to stand out in His distinctiveness as the only One.
Ques. Why is He so called here?
C.A.C. Well, I think that God's object is that there is only the One; Jesus had been a name in general use, but after the coming in of the true Jesus, it is remarkable how it was suddenly blotted out from the directories of the world. The Jews would not call their children by that name and the Gentiles did not wish to, so the Name really belongs to one Person.
Rem. We read of Jesus who was called Justus (@Colossians 4: 11). The name was changed.
C.A.C. Yes, they altered his name. Christians saw the impropriety of using it. None of us wants to be called Jesus, but we want Him to stand out in His distinction before us, and we want to learn the putting off of the old man and
{346}
putting on of the new in Him.
Rem. "Which according to God is created in truthful righteousness and holiness".
C.A.C. Yes, the new man is a divine creation; that brings out another thought, that he is a new creation, in righteousness, and it is in truth. This very truth especially produces righteousness and holiness, the old man having been put off, and it makes room for a creation of God in the moral sphere -- not a material creation, but moral, and the new man is that, and all the saints make up the new man. It seems clear that the old man is not an individual. The old man is morally after the devil, but the new man is after God. It is a great conception of a new order of man created by souls coming under the influence and instruction of Jesus, so that falsehood and anger and stealing and bad feelings are all utterly inconsistent with the thought of the new man, and ought to be put off as inconsistent.
Rem. We are free from these old-man products really, and they should not mark us at all.
C.A.C. And yet in a practical sense we need these exhortations as to truthfulness. There is a great amount of untruthfulness and dishonesty. In a practical sense they remain unjudged and so the Holy Spirit is grieved and things are not in power. We complain of lack of power, but if we knew the conditions we should be surprised that there is any power. When we have professed to put off the old man, it is really a dreadful thing to retain his features. And why should we want in any way to deceive the brethren, for we are members one of another? There is no sense in it, is there?
{347}
NOTES OF A READING @EPHESIANS 4: 25 - 32; @EPHESIANS 5: 1 - 4
C.A.C. One has thought that these exhortations are needful because of the general tendency to revert to the original type, a manifest tendency in all nature; that is, you may cultivate any animal or plant or vegetation, and you may bring it under cultivation to a high state of development, but if left alone it will speedily revert to the original type. Well, that is a lesson in nature which has its corresponding danger amongst the saints, so that the Spirit of God would maintain holy exercise with saints such as the Ephesians, seeing that if spiritual cultivation ceased to be active, they might revert to the former things.
Each one of us knows what our original type was. It was a condition, however modified it might be by restraint or by christian influence, that was a vile type, and we are thoroughly ashamed of it. So constant exercises are necessary or we should revert to the original type.
Ques. Is there a kind of parallel in @2 Corinthians 12, which begins with "a man in Christ" and then speaks of terrible features at the end of the chapter?
C.A.C. Yes, so that light as to the highest possible position through grace will not preserve us; there must be the continual exercise, bearing in mind the truth as to putting off the old man and putting on the new, "as the truth is in Jesus". We must keep that in mind. We cannot go through a single day without considering that it involves our having put off the old man and put on the new, and remembering too that we have been sealed for the day of redemption by the Holy Spirit of God.
Rem. The putting on of the new man is not exactly a continuous thing, but the instruction is that the life is to be in conformity to that.
C.A.C. Yes, it is a question of putting off the old man
{348}
and putting on the new, is it not? I think we have put off the old man as Christians; as having come under the teaching of the Christ, our minds have been formed after a new pattern, after the pattern of Christ. Now continual exercise is needed that we do not admit something that is contrary; a lie admitted is a dark and devilish feature, and so with everything named here on that line.
Rem. I suppose the two sides would be necessary; the putting off -- the negative side -- having been done in the death of Christ, and the positive side in being occupied with Christ, so that in feeding on Him we become like Him. While the new man is an abstract thought, there are features produced positively in new creation in the saints; there can be no deterioration in that.
C.A.C. And we are to walk in that way. The test is, is it new creation? We all know that when we decline in soul and our converse with heaven is not kept up, we revert and these things command us again.
Rem. So with Peter in his denial, for illustration.
C.A.C. I think you see it in Peter then, and in other illustrations. How easily he fell under the influence of other brethren from Judaea, and I do not think I am any better than the apostle Peter!
We tend to revert to the original type. I think that is a sentence that might well be ingrained in our minds, for we go back to our own characteristics, and we are born liars, every one of us. And the old man is an order of being that has innumerable phases and comes out differently in different people.
Ques. I am not quite clear about this. When do we put off the old man?
C.A.C. When we come to the truth as set forth in Jesus; that is, it has been set forth in a Man; and in the death of the Lord Jesus there was manifestly the putting off of the old man; that is, He was in the place and condemnation of the old man, but He put off, laid down the
{349}
life in which He could be made sin, and His putting on the new man really is His coming out in resurrection, with no sign of the old man on Him. He has put on a new order of life that can never be tainted by sin. *We* do it by hearing Christ and being instructed in Christ. "But *ye* have not thus learnt the Christ, if ye have heard him and been instructed in him according as the truth is in Jesus" .
It is thus we learn the absolute necessity of putting off the old man and putting on the new; and a person who has not done it is not a Christian; he could not be. What do you say to that?
Ques. Oh, that is all right, but is there a point when we come to that position definitely, that we see it in Christ?
C.A.C. Yes, and how can you take up your christian relations with God on any other ground? There is no other relation. If I am clothed in the old man I am just the same as if I had not the instruction.
Rem. It seems to me that, though they are believers, many have not liberty because they do not see this very thing.
C.A.C. The apostle presents the truth in a very concentrated form, and it may be spread over a very considerable experience, embracing such scriptures as @Romans 7. He says, 'Now you have heard Christ and you have been instructed in Him and what it means to put off the old man and to put on the new, and you have learned it under the instruction of Christ'. Whether you have been forty years or one year over it does not alter it; and if we have not come to it, we have not come to christianity.
Rem. This could hardly be said of the Romans or the Corinthians, but of the Ephesians; but God has it in view for all His people.
C.A.C. That is so. Of course it is presented first in the gospel; one part of the gospel is that our old man has been crucified with Christ. "Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him" (@Romans 6: 6) is presented in the
{350}
gospel. No exercised soul would have any comfort or peace until he learnt that. It is a divine fact that no experience of mind can interfere with. Well, that is to be received as part of the gospel. That old man, I am disgusted with him, and I must be free of him to be happy in God's presence.
Rem. We are told to put on the Lord Jesus Christ in Romans.
C.A.C. In Romans the babe in Christ realises what a privilege it is to "put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not take forethought for the flesh" (@Romans 13: 14). He is made into a new dress for me and I am to put it on. To gratify the flesh you have to make provision, a mercy it is so, and if we do not, we do not fulfil the lust of the flesh. That is putting it in a simple way for the new convert to understand.
Is it not important to see that this is not at all a question of doctrine? He has in mind practice; you stole, you were a corrupt person. What has happened? Have you put off all that? If not, you are not a Christian. The whole point is intensely practical; it refers to conduct, not ideas in the mind, religious or moral. You might have them and yet be stealing. Nothing is really truth but the life of Christ in the believer. If so, I have practically done with all these things marking the man in the flesh. If not careful, however, I shall revert -- a terrible thing. Then I must keep near to God and not grieve the Holy Spirit. It is not a question of grieving God in heaven, but One who has permanently attached Himself to me as a seal by the act of God, so He is very near to me and I must be careful not to grieve Him.
Ques. What is meant by being "sealed for the day of redemption"?
C.A.C. There is to be nothing about the saints that is not fit to be transferred to that scene of absolute redemption. The day of redemption will free us from the very presence of the flesh; so that you do not think of any moral change. I think that most believers look for the time
{351}
when they have done with the flesh and infirmity, and any thought of it being beforehand is for them out of the question. The real truth of christianity is that we are free of all the things which do not correspond with God's redemption thought.
Now take this epistle, what wonderful things are said: "Raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus" -- what a position! Now, he says, you can be in moral correspondence down here with what you are graced in in Christ in heaven -- it is wonderful.
Ques. Speaking truth would be the current language between the members, would you say?
C.A.C. It is a very good way of putting it.
Rem. It says of Jews in Nehemiah's day that their children spoke half in the Jews language and half in the language of Ashdod (@Nehemiah 13: 24).
C.A.C. Many believers are like that, speaking a few words of the heavenly language and a good many of the other.
Ques. You said that there was no need for any moral change, that the church was fit for translation. There is no reference to the body here, I noticed; this is moral conformity to Christ here, is it not?
C.A.C. Yes, and of course the body of Christ is the wonderful vessel in which the features of Christ are expressed. There could be no change in that. God is going to maintain Christ here in the saints, and He is not going to let any power turn Him out. Rebecca was made quite suitable for Isaac before ever she saw him. See what pains the steward took to make her suitable for Isaac, when she had never seen him.
Ques. Would you explain verse 26?
C.A.C. I think it puts the saints in a very tight place.
Rem. We are all puzzled as to this verse.
C.A.C. Well, it means that if we are to be like Christ,
{352}
we should be angry. It says distinctly that the Lord was angry, and we should not be like Christ if we were not angry sometimes, but we must be very careful, for it may degenerate into sin more than any other human movement.
Ques. Is that why it says, "Let not the sun set upon your wrath"?
C.A.C. Yes, that is, it is to be brief, you must eliminate it before you go to bed; otherwise it will damage your spirit.
Rem. It would make room for the devil.
C.A.C. I think anger in the human spirit is a most favourable state for the devil. Demon possession begins with a violent outburst of anger, which seems to give the devil an opportunity, so that we ought to be very sensitive and careful. It is the devil getting in instead of the Spirit of God. There are great supernatural powers contemplated here, and we are, as it were, between these two powers. There is the danger of falling into the power of the devil, and the possibility of going on happily with the Spirit of God. It shows what a wonderful person a saint is; the possibilities of evil and good are almost infinite.
Rem. Job was a subject of it.
C.A.C. Yes, and we might begin our anger in the Spirit and end in the flesh. Anger is a thing not to play with.
Ques. Does God being angry with the wicked every day open up another subject?
C.A.C. Yes, and corresponds with what we are saying, that anger is a christian quality.
Rem. God makes His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, I link that up with God being angry with the wicked every day. Every day the sun shines; it is what He is every day.
C.A.C. He shows grace to the people even that He is angry with.
This chapter ends up, after speaking of what we were, with what we are to be. "And be to one another kind,
{353}
compassionate, forgiving one another, so as God also in Christ has forgiven you". It is the behaviour of divine Persons that is to regulate us now.
Rem. It is striking that these things should come out in relation to the Ephesian saints.
Rem. It is the law of gravity, the highest and the lowest. The foundation is right.
Rem. I wondered if the higher the plane on which we are, the clearer we should be as to things.
C.A.C. The thought of coming out in the character of God is wonderful. It is not only that we avoid these things; a man of the world would admit that they are to be condemned; but the Christian also has before him to exhibit the character of God; so that we come out as children of God, marked by His grace, because the word for forgiveness is really 'showing grace to', so that God is expressed, instead of the moral features of the devil, on the line of kindness and compassion and showing grace; that is, if things are trying to us -- and human life is largely made up of contact with things more or less trying to us -- let us be exercised to bring God in in reference to those things, to act as He would act. Well, that is a mighty triumph!
{354}
NOTES OF A READING @EPHESIANS 5: 1 - 13
C.A.C. It is important for us to keep ever in view that our associations are with divine Persons. It brings in the highest possible motive to keep us from the lowest, basest desires of the flesh. But the Holy Spirit and God and Christ are all brought in in this connection.
Rem. In the way that we get in the end of the previous chapter the exhortation not to grieve the Holy Spirit and to bring in that which is good, it seems to show a very good state reached. After referring to giving and bringing in that which is good for edification, the Holy Spirit is mentioned.
C.A.C. Suggesting the necessity to us of the Holy Spirit. It is not without significance that the Holy Spirit in taking a bodily form takes the form of a dove, one of the most sensitive of creatures, intimating to us the extreme sensitiveness of the Holy Spirit. And we are never to forget that the Holy Spirit is with us permanently.
Rem. The things mentioned in verse 31 would grieve Him.
C.A.C. It is certain that all the things mentioned from chapter 4: 25 down to chapter 5: 7 are things that would grieve the Spirit. They would grieve any one of us who was at all rightly constituted in thought and feeling, and how much more the Holy Spirit of God!
Ques. Is there some specific reason in this connection why He is mentioned as the Holy Spirit of God here?
C.A.C. Yes, it gives a very exalted thought of the holiness of the Spirit. The psalmist could say, "Take not the Spirit of thy holiness from me" (@Psalm 51: 11). Well, that does not reach up to the height of the "Holy Spirit of God". How wonderful to think of a divine Person being attached to us, for that is the thought here, I suppose, not exactly His indwelling but sealing, so that the Holy Spirit is attached to
{355}
us as a seal.
Ques. Is the seal connected with ownership, the claim of God upon those He has secured for Himself?
C.A.C. Yes.
Rem. I think that it all emphasises what you said at the outset, our having to do with divine Persons, so it is the "Holy Spirit of God", and all these things are in contrast.
C.A.C. Yes, and it would have a great effect upon us as to where we go and what we do. Think of bringing the Holy Spirit into contact with something that is evil; it is terrible to think of, is it not? And especially would this apply to our relations as brethren. They have all to be governed by the thought that the Holy Spirit of God is attached to us.
Ques. How should we know if we grieve Him?
C.A.C. Well, I have thought sometimes that a great many believers do not know.
Ques. Would it bring a sense of distance?
C.A.C. Yes, surely. If we do not know nearness we shall not know distance, shall we? I think it is possible for a saint to live at such a distance from divine Persons that it is not felt to be distant. People talk sometimes of being out of communion; no one knows what that is except those who know nearness; and we shall not if we have not known what it is to walk in company with the Holy Spirit, in companionship with Him, the comfort of it, the light of it, and the holiness of it, so that if anything occurs we should feel at once the effect of it. That holy Person is attached to me and *He* is grieved.
When I was quite young, an old man said to us, 'Boys, whatever you do, keep on good terms with the Holy Spirit'. I have not forgotten it yet.
Ques. Is it remarkable that the Spirit is mentioned in every chapter in this epistle? Does it indicate that the only power to enjoy the things of God is in connection with the Holy Spirit?
{356}
C.A.C. The Holy Spirit needs to be much more of a reality to all the saints. I suppose nothing accounts for the departure and worldliness and all that has come into any christian gathering like the fact that the Holy Spirit is not recognised.
So God Himself becomes the Model after which the saints are to be patterned; they are to be patterned after God, as he says in verse 32, "so as God also in Christ has forgiven you". God Himself is the Model, and this is so particularly when anything occurs that ruffles us a bit. Sometimes the brethren do things they ought not to do. Well, what kind of spirit are we to show? God is to be a model; am I like God? Am I to be like God or man? Man would resent it and retaliate, but God shows grace.
It is a dispensation of grace, for God is all the time showing grace to men. I have thought a good deal lately that even God's government is subservient to divine grace. In such things as are going on in the nations today under the government of God, the sorrows and afflictions, even that seems to be the purpose of His grace. He has a definite purpose in it. It is not government on the line of judgment, but on the line of grace. The most terrible and serious ways of God in government all serve His grace. It is important to see this, that God is really superior to all the evil in the world, and He would have us superior to evil in one another. It is very practical.
Rem. If it affects God I suppose we should think differently of it.
C.A.C. These things are personal matters, and in regard of that we always have the privilege of showing grace. If it has to be brought before the assembly, it is another matter; but it always has in view the restoration of the offender. It is for his good, with that in view, never merely a judicial process. But it is a wonderful standard that we are to be imitators of God.
Rem. To be like God we must know Him.
{357}
C.A.C. We have learned God in the most marvellous grace; however shallow we are we have some sense of that. That is the model. We are to be as beloved children and then to walk in love "even as the Christ loved us". Christ is brought in as the Model too. If we had to correct such things as are in this chapter, I doubt whether we should have begun on such a level; but that is God's way, He brings in the very highest thing to correct the lowest.
Ques. Would you explain chapter 4: 32, "As God also in Christ has forgiven you"?
C.A.C. Is it not that God has shown the full measure of His grace in Christ?
Ques. Would that be all that came out in Christ on earth?
C.A.C. Yes, I think it is the extraordinary favourableness of God set forth in Christ, not exactly the forgiveness of sins absolutely taken away, never to be imputed any more, but in the sense of showing forgiveness. You can do that to an unrepentant man. So that God is on this footing: that He is not putting sins to account with anybody, not speaking to men about their sins, but about Christ, and it is a moment favourable to man.
Now we are always to be favourable in our minds towards one another; we regard everyone favourably, and we are quite safe in imitating God. You might go grossly wrong in imitating one of the brethren. So that however naughty a person is, you regard them favourably; you have no thought in your mind with regard to them except their good. Is that not right?
"Walk in love" brings in something higher than this. It is Christ as the burnt-offering here that becomes the model for the saints -- He went to the greatest possible length. He "delivered Himself up for us"; that is, He went to the extreme point; and it was delightful to God, it all went up as a sweet savour to God.
Ques. A saint suffering in love takes on that character
{358}
before God, would you say?
C.A.C. Yes, and this is to be characteristic; it does not always involve your life. You will remember a letter of commendation that two brothers had, saying that they had "given up their lives for the name of the Lord Jesus Christ" (@Acts 15: 26). It is the same word as "delivered up" that is used. They did not die, we know, so that it describes their loving devotion of heart. So that nothing can deprive the youngest of us from giving up his life for the name of the Lord Jesus. It is stimulating, is it not?
Ques. Is it akin to laying down our lives for the brethren in @1 John 3?
C.A.C. It is exactly a companion scripture. That aspect is purely delightful to God. The sin-offering would hardly be brought in here. We cannot imitate Christ as the sin-offering, He was the only One who could bear the judgment of God, and there was no sweet savour in that. But the burnt-offering yielded sweet savour, and God looks that the burnt-offering should be perpetuated, does He not? It strikes me as exceedingly affecting to us that we are put into such wonderful associations with divine Persons; whether it is the Holy Spirit, or God or Christ. We should value this and covet it, for no such honour was ever before conferred upon creatures.
Rem. It is no question of demand here, but He "delivered himself up".
C.A.C. "Even as the Christ loved us, and delivered himself up for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour". It is entirely on His part, and becomes a model for us. It is possible for us to give up our lives for the saints, any of us may do it.
The saints are thus identified with the burnt-offering. It is said of the burnt-offering that the fire was never to be put out, and on God's part He promised it never should go out.
Rem. The fire was never to go out, not the offering, so that it was always available for the offering. All the time
{359}
was the opportunity, and as long as the saints are here, is the opportunity of the burnt-offering.
Ques. Does it go with what is expressed in @1 John 4: 12, "If we love one another, God abides in us, and his love is perfected in us"?
C.A.C. Yes, quite so.
Rem. We are to be children of light and love.
Rem. Yes, I thought there was a flame about love, as we get at the end of the Song of Solomon.
C.A.C. It is a delightful contrast to all that the Spirit of God is rebuking and warning the saints against; it is beautiful to think of the saints yielding to God this sweet-smelling savour.
Rem. It is like coming into the fresh air on the cliff after breathing smoke.
C.A.C. It is like that, and shows the saints so associated with divine Persons that the very mention of unclean things is repugnant.
Ques. Would you say a word as to "the kingdom of the Christ and God"?
C.A.C. I think it is to show that in moving on to heavenly ground we do not leave behind the truth of the kingdom.
Rem. All is accumulative in that way.
C.A.C. Yes. That is, we carry Romans along with us into Ephesians; and both aspects of the kingdom are preached: the kingdom of the Christ, the rule of God's anointed Man; and then the direct rule of God Himself -- two important aspects of the kingdom. It is on a lower level than what we have been speaking of; it is the kingdom side of the truth, but we need that. One at home in the higher circle that we have been speaking of can come gracefully down to the level of the kingdom without loss of dignity, so I suppose that an Ephesian believer would be an excellent Roman believer.
{360}
NOTES OF A READING @EPHESIANS 5: 7 - 21
C.A.C. It is noticeable how prominent *the Lord* is in this portion: "light in the Lord", "proving what is agreeable to the Lord", "understanding what is the will of the Lord", and "singing and chanting with your heart to the Lord".
Rem. That seems to cover a pretty wide range. We have often thought of the kingdom as related to the Lord; this is the thought of what is inward in relation to the Lord.
C.A.C. It is with the thought that He has become the supreme One to us, not exactly His official place as made Lord.
Ques. Is it not more a question of affection?
C.A.C. Yes, the Lord often seems to stand in that relation. It is an affectionate term, not simply that He has His claim and authority; but when Mary said, "They have taken away my Lord", she was expressing a good deal, was she not? It is a title used in a very happy and holy connection. Elizabeth spoke of "the mother of my Lord". Paul says, "Christ Jesus my Lord". Thomas says, "My Lord and my God". In all those connections it does not appear that it is quite an official title.
Rem. I think that is beautiful to see; the Lord claims affection from His own.
C.A.C. Yes, and love delights to address Him thus. We do not address Him in the assembly in any other way; even if we address Him as Head, we address Him reverentially as Lord.
Rem. "Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Lord" (verse 22).
C.A.C. Does that not confirm what we are saying? Peter reminds us that Sarah called Abraham lord. Well, it denotes subjection, all that is involved in it, yet it was an affectionate term, and we perhaps need to get over to that
{361}
side.
Rem. The Lord's supper is a question of affection.
C.A.C. I was thinking that there are seven references to Christ as Lord in @1 Corinthians 11 in connection with the Supper. It seems to imply that He has a place in the affections of the saints. It is not only our public confession of the Lord, that no one else has any rights, but more the reverent recognition of Him in affection, so that the singing and chanting is "to the Lord" here in this highest epistle, which gives us the full light of christianity, if we may so say, while in Colossians the singing is to God. There is instruction in that.
The Lord has a great place in this epistle. The Gentiles are built together in the Spirit, but it is "in the Lord". "In whom ... also" (chapter 2: 22); it is not in Christ but the Lord. It is a question of our affections, and I think we are all concerned that we should be built up in the appreciation of the Lord in His greatness. We have noticed how Luke speaks of Him as the Lord more often than the other gospels. It seems as if Luke, in writing out of his own affection and appreciation of Him, cannot refrain from speaking of Him as the Lord.
One would like more of that spirit in the assembly, speaking of the Lord in the Holy Spirit. That is not merely referring to Him as "our Lord", so that if a brother speaks of the Lord in the assembly you would like it to convey something of what we have been speaking of.
Rem. John said, "It is the Lord" (@John 21: 7).
C.A.C. Yes, that is exactly it. How much is expressed in one word. So that the saints come into the region that is filled with that wonderful Person -- so they are light. There is no element of darkness left in our souls if we are really in the presence of the Lord.
Rem. In @2 Corinthians 3 we are transformed according to the same image as beholding the glory of the Lord.
C.A.C. And there it is not a question of His authority
{362}
quite but the radiance that shines, all the radiance of God in grace that shines in Him as Lord. I suppose one could hardly be in the light without some of the fruit appearing. It says, "for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth".
Rem. The contrast to that is these works of darkness.
Rem. It explores the whole condition, "Ye were once darkness".
C.A.C. We were made up of darkness, but this is a beautiful contrast, "now light in the Lord". Christians walking in the light of the Lord are light, they are luminous bodies.
Rem. In the gospel we get "sons of light" (@John 12:36).
C.A.C. I think that is the one reference to sonship in John's gospel, is it not?
Ques. I should like to know more about "light in the Lord". How does it come about that we become luminous bodies? There is no question that we were once darkness.
C.A.C. It is stated here positively, and I suppose the quotation in verse 14 is to show us that what will come to pass for Jerusalem in a coming day has already come to pass for the saints, so they are in the shining of Christ and they become luminous. I think the verses in @Isaiah 60: 1 - 3 help. It says, "Arise, shine! for thy light is come, and the glory of Jehovah is risen upon thee. For behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the peoples; but Jehovah will arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen on thee. And the nations shall walk by thy light, and kings by the brightness of thy rising". Is not the scripture we are reading a kind of commentary on that?
Rem. In @Isaiah 52 we get the awaking. "Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; ... Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit down, Jerusalem". Awaking and arising, the two thoughts come in.
C.A.C. Jerusalem for long centuries has been asleep
{363}
and even dead, but the moment is coming when she will awake and rise from the dead and come into the light of Jehovah. This is one of the scriptures that would prove that Jehovah is Jesus.
It has come to pass already for us; infinite love has brought us into the shining of Christ, and just as the glory will be seen on Jerusalem, it is seen on the saints of the assembly in the fact that they appear as light in the Lord and as children of light.
Ques. Why is it "the Christ" and not "Lord" there (verse 14)? Is it the official place of Christ as anointed?
C.A.C. Yes, the shining as viewed here is in the blessed anointed Man, so that the thought of the Lord is magnified in this scripture, and the thought of Christ gets a peculiar lustre and glory. Both ideas are greatly enlarged here.
Rem. This scripture in Isaiah seems to suggest more reflected light. "Jehovah will arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen on thee. And the nations shall walk by thy light".
C.A.C. It says, "The nations shall walk by thy light, and kings by the brightness of thy rising". It suggests that they are luminous, the result of the divine shining upon them, but they shine. Hence the saints are viewed here as luminous, shining in the light of the Lord and of the Christ. It is a beautiful thought, because here it is a peculiar kind of gross darkness, as in Isaiah, of peculiarly dense character.
Ques. Is this luminous condition the result of the work of the Spirit in the saints?
C.A.C. Yes, surely.
Rem. God is light, and you cannot be near to God without being luminous.
Rem. Paul in addressing Agrippa speaks of the light above the brightness of the sun and then speaks of the Lord sending him to the nations "to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the power of
{364}
Satan to God".
C.A.C. That is a beautiful connection of thought that fits in with this scripture. It is as risen that the Lord announces light to the nations.
Rem. Of the heavenly city it says, "Her shining", as if she were luminous.
C.A.C. I think that is very beautiful, that the city is accredited with having a light of her own, and no doubt that is the thought.
For an illustration of a luminous saint, you could hardly find a better than the man of @John 9. Yesterday he was darkness, but now he is light, so that every word now that he speaks shows that he is characterised by light, *he* is light. Well, we have only to keep where divine love has set us and we shall be like that. One has seen simple souls, with little knowledge of the letter of the truth, able to discern -- there was light there. It all seems to hang together with the right appreciation of Christ. That Person will put everything right and make the saints luminous in the presence of the gross darkness in the world. It is very beautiful. 'Shining' is a word that refers to heavenly luminaries. The stars shine in their own light like the sun; the moon's light is reflected light. And of course the sun is the most splendid figure of Christ that the universe affords, and the stars are the saints, especially the heavenly saints, for Abraham was told he was to have a seed like the stars.
Rem. One star differs from another star in glory.
C.A.C. They are all part of the display of divine glory. "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the expanse sheweth the work of his hands" (@Psalm 19: 1). Now the saints are the display of the glory of the heavenly firmament.
I think we ought to be more concerned about what we *are*. Thank God, we all have light, but we want to *be* light.
Rem. Having on the armour of light is what we are (@Romans 13: 12).
C.A.C. So that a man is that at all times; you cannot
{365}
take him unawares.
Rem. In making contacts in business, if a man is a believer there is generally something to be noticed about him, and I suppose there ought to be something distinct.
C.A.C. We ought always to be on the look-out for these mystery men. There are some remarkable people to be found in the world and they are worth looking for; they have a secret quite unknown to the common run of people.
Ques. "Wake up" -- are we to take that to heart?
C.A.C. It is put in a form that the Spirit of God can use to exercise anyone not in the shining. If I am not, this is a word for me. But the scripture supposes that we have woken up and that we have come into the shining. That is the christian position; it is not marked by darkness but by Christ shining on us. He is shining on us this minute from heaven. It is the blessing of the Christian that he is in the shining of a glorified Christ; that is the position, and we are here this afternoon to encourage one another into it.
It is like the putting off and putting on; he does not exhort us to do it, you have done it. So the saint was once asleep and dead, and he wakes up to be in the blessed shining of a glorified Christ, and that is transcendent, you cannot surpass it.
Rem. It would be seen in goodness and righteousness and truth, as the fruit of the light.
C.A.C. That is the moral side of it, how one is morally affected by it. This world is an abominably filthy scene, and in the midst of it the saints are found as light and luminous.
Ques. Why does it say, "from among the dead"?
C.A.C. Well, I think he is quoting the scripture, and that which is going to be true of Jerusalem in the millennial day is true of the saints of the assembly now.
Ques. Do you think that one scripture includes the knowledge of another?
C.A.C. "Wherefore he says", and he quotes it as
{366}
having present application. He does not suppose the saints are dead or asleep. They anticipate what Jerusalem will know in a coming day. And if I am not experiencing it, well, I had better look into matters.
{367}
NOTES OF A READING @EPHESIANS 5: 15 - 21
Rem. The thought of walking is referred to three times in this paragraph: "Walk in love", "Walk as children of light", and now, "See therefore how ye walk carefully". I suppose it is easy to be careless in our walk. One of our spiritual fathers spoke of 'high talk and low walk'.
C.A.C. Yes, the need for wisdom is very great in connection with the walk.
Ques. Is not the connection in relation to verse 8 as to walking as children of light the "proving what is agreeable to the Lord", a parenthesis coming between? There should be that object with us.
C.A.C. No reference was made last time to the light making manifest: "All things having their true character exposed by the light are made manifest; for that which makes everything manifest is light". It is not just exposing what is contrary; does it not bring to light what is agreeable, what is good and precious?
Rem. We see the principle in the pathway of the Lord here, everything was exposed. In @John 8 those who brought the woman were exposed, and further on in the chapter it says, "He that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life" (verse 12).
Rem. We prefer the love side to the light.
C.A.C. It does expose, but light in itself is a sweet thing and a pleasant thing for the eyes to behold (@Ecclesiastes 11: 7). We should not question it in the shining of Christ, should we, Christ shining upon me? Our positive fruitfulness is the result of being in the light. Things grow in suitable conditions. The Lord has a great place in this section; it is a question of the appreciation of Himself, what is in Him.
Ques. He is made unto us wisdom, it says in
{368}
Corinthians. We are to be "not as unwise but as wise"; how would it be seen?
Rem. There was a suggestion last week of the words of the wise being as goads and as nails, fastening the thing home upon us.
C.A.C. It would come out in making the best use of one's time, apparently.
Rem. Redeeming it, the thought of purchase coming in, making the most of it.
Rem. It means, 'Seizing every good and favourable opportunity' (note e, Darby Translation).
Rem. And it says the more so because the days are evil.
Ques. Is this the practical working out of the position of children of light? There is exercise required in relation to it, so that our walk and all we do is a matter of wisdom; we are concerned that we should live up to the position. That being our character, we should see that those things mark our character and that is unremitting, every available moment is made use of for the shining out as children of light. It is remarkable that in that way we are called upon to exercise care, to "walk carefully".
C.A.C. Righteous persons necessarily move in wisdom. God not only orders the circumstances but everything is done in wisdom. Wisdom is the principal thing.
Rem. Moving in wisdom is the thing that we notice about the saints. Here it is a general testimony; it should be our general character.
Rem. In the case of the ten virgins, when the cry went out only the wise were ready. Might we be awake but not in wisdom?
C.A.C. According to the parable, wisdom would seem to be the great test, for those that are suitable to be companions of the Lord in His great marital joy are marked by wisdom.
{369}
Rem. They took oil in their lamps.
C.A.C. I was just thinking that. Wisdom would come out in our giving full place to the Spirit, for they not only have lamps, but they have vessels.
Rem. It says of the woman in @Proverbs 31: 26, "She openeth her mouth with wisdom".
C.A.C. Is the thought of wisdom that what is done in wisdom could not be improved upon? That is a fairly high standard.
Rem. I am sure that divine wisdom is like that.
C.A.C. That would necessitate our being filled with the Spirit and not energised by any other power.
Rem. Of the woman in Proverbs it says, "Let her own works praise her in the gates"; it is beyond reproof.
Ques. Wisdom is brought in in 1 Corinthians with a view to the adjustment of all things in the assembly, is it not?
Rem. Christendom has adopted expediency; that is not wisdom.
C.A.C. I think it is important that we should be exercised to move in wisdom, and as this scripture would remind us there is no need for us to go without the Spirit of God in anything.
Rem. The more we hold Christ in affectionate regard, the more we should desire to be filled with the Spirit.
C.A.C. I am sure that is so; and the result of that would be an increase of joy so that our communications would take on the character of joy. "Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs" indicates a joyful people.
Ques. What would be the difference between psalms and hymns and spiritual songs? All seem happy.
C.A.C. That seems the general character. A psalm would signify the utterance of inward joy, which is often lacking in saints. There is a difference, I suppose, in the three things. It supposes a capacity in the saints to compose
{370}
these different expressions of joy. We ought all to take note of the fact that we have not a book of Psalms in the New Testament.
Ques. Will you open out what is in mind in the thought of a psalm?
C.A.C. Well, it would appear generally to be the result of the exercise that we have gone through with God. I suppose that every exercise we go through with God results in a particular psalm.
Rem. They should be pretty common. In the ministry meeting it says every one has a psalm (@1 Corinthians 14: 26).
C.A.C. Yes, we are all looked at as capable of providing our own psalms. It is not so in the case of Israel. One hundred and fifty psalms have been prepared for the Jewish remnant; their hymn book is prepared for them. But we do not need this, we are expected to furnish our own psalms; and a person who has not any is hardly fit for a place in the choir, is he?
Ques. Is it a completed exercise?
C.A.C. Well, there were one hundred and fifty psalms, which suggests a great variety. Any saint walking with care and wisdom should have psalms; it all hangs together. We should then have plenty of psalms because we should get experience with God. The true value of any circumstance is that it affords experience of God's ways with us. Saints commonly say, 'I would not have been without it'. One who says that has composed a psalm -- inwardly at any rate. And a psalm remains a permanent store. David wrote many of the Psalms, but on certain occasions he makes a selection. On one occasion he makes a new psalm from six pieces culled from other psalms.
Rem. It is setting things together, and it is hard work to get it so that the expression is the best.
Rem. A psalm was composed by the rivers of Babylon. "By the rivers of Babylon ... there they that carried us away captive required of us a song ... . How
{371}
should we sing a song of Jehovah's upon a foreign soil? If I forget thee, Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill" (@Psalm 137). It is a most touching psalm, but comes into the book.
Ques. Have you any thought as to a hymn?
C.A.C. It would appear that these utterances referred to as psalms are experimental, the result of how we have proved God in our circumstances, but there are utterances of praise that are independent of experience and stand in relation to the spiritual light that God has given us as to Himself. Speaking generally, you would not look for psalms in the morning meeting, but you look for hymns.
Ques. In @Psalm 22, as quoted in @Hebrews 2: 12, it says He will praise God with singing. Is it the idea of a hymn there?
C.A.C. Yes, "I will hymn" it is really.
Rem. It says in @Mark 14: 26, "Having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives".
Ques. Why do they sometimes sing the Psalms in churches? How do you account for it?
C.A.C. I think it is accounted for by their not having anything better. "Singing and chanting with your heart to the Lord", shows evidently the singing is to be to the Lord as well as to God. Our hymn book would give the impression that we sing more to the Lord than to God, but I am not sure that is as it ought to be!
Ques. What do you understand by "spiritual songs"?
C.A.C. Well, I suppose they may be addressed to others or to oneself, as, "Bless Jehovah, O my soul" (@Psalm 103: 1; @Psalm 104: 1).
{372}
NOTES OF A READING @EPHESIANS 6: 1 - 10
C.A.C. Is the thought here that the christian household becomes a sphere in which the truth is worked out; that is, with the husbands and wives first, then children and parents, and then bondmen? It rather supposes household conditions.
Ques. There is a good deal of reference to the Lord in these exhortations, is there not? Would the authority of the Lord provide the protection for the truth in which the epistle is worked out practically?
C.A.C. It would be that He has the supreme place with us. Why should this be brought in in connection with children, "obey your parents *in the Lord*"?
Ques. Does the expression "in the Lord" fix a boundary for us?
C.A.C. What is in your mind?
Rem. I was wondering as to whether the thought is to obey them as in the Lord, or that you obey as far as you can without transgressing the authority of the Lord over you.
Rem. In @Colossians 3: 20 in a similar passage it is, "Obey your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing in the Lord".
Ques. Would this be a converted family?
Ques. Does it bring in the moral authority of the Lord to bear on the actions -- a moral qualification?
Rem. The whole hang of it was as being part of the assembly, and so the authority is over the children too.
Rem. In the case of the Lord Himself, on one occasion He was entirely regulated by His Father's business; but after, it says, He went down and was subject to them.
Rem. It was a recognition that the relation was a divine institution and therefore righteous under the Lord.
Ques. You had some thought as to an affectionate
{373}
appreciation of the claims of the Lord bringing it nearer to us than the claim of authority?
C.A.C. It would seem that that element enters into it, wives being exhorted to submit themselves to their own husbands, as to the Lord. Children are addressed as intelligent as regards this matter. The children are to understand the peculiar setting of the believing household as in the Lord, whether they are converted, or unconverted, as we speak.
Rem. The fact of baptism brings them inside.
C.A.C. And does not the Lord very early impress the mind of children with the beneficent character of His lordship, the great advantage it is to be where the Lord is owned? So that it does not become a mere question of obedience on the line of authority, but as realising the value and gain of it. I think the Lord would support that in the children of the saints.
Rem. To display in them a feature that belongs to the assembly.
C.A.C. I was wondering whether the different relationships have their existence so that certain things can be worked out, so that what is spiritual has the predominant place.
Though I was not a good boy, I early realised being thankful that my parents owned the Lord, having a sense that it was good, though there was that in me which resented it, and rebelled against it. Would not the work of God begin with a child like that? Satan would encourage the spirit of lawlessness in children, beginning his work very early. It is good to think of the counteracting work of God in children so that they feel it good to be in a sphere where the Lord has influence, and which is a far better place than the world.
Rem. It says in @Deuteronomy 6: 20 that the children will ask their parents as to the ordinances, and in verse 25, "It shall be our righteousness".
{374}
C.A.C. And "for our good continually" (verse 24).
Rem. The parents set the commandments before the children to be carried on. So that assembly principles are carried out in the family circle and carried on in the children.
Rem. There seems to be a suggestive touch of eternal life in verse 3. The blessing commanded was "life for evermore" (@Psalm 133: 3), and the promise to those who obey and honour their parents is to be long-lived on the earth, blessing enjoyed as life lived on the earth in this circle.
C.A.C. It is rather remarkable that should be brought in in Ephesians.
Rem. There is a strong element of righteousness in this epistle, righteousness in all relationships.
C.A.C. If children want to live long and not die early, they had better pay attention to this, had they not?
Rem. The moral side of the truth always underlies what is spiritual and affords protection for it, what is just, etc., providing for what is spiritual.
C.A.C. I am sure that is very important; otherwise we might have a lot of printed matter in our minds which would not give us a link with God; but the moment we begin to move practically in relation to the Lord, we get helped. It is surprising what a lot of printed matter we can have in our minds without the enjoyment of the things or its giving us any link with God. Just one little thing done in relation to the Lord will help us more than all the books in our bookcase.
Rem. To obey is better than sacrifice.
C.A.C. The practical part of Ephesians gives us the actual photograph of persons who are in the good of the epistle; it comes out in a practical way. And we are tested in everyday matters, are we not? Parents are certainly viewed as having experience of the nurture and admonition of the Lord, so they can bring their children up in it. They have been self-willed and so it would include a certain
{375}
touch of sympathy with the children. If a parent has a very self-willed child, how is it to be handled? Only in the sense that the Lord has dealt with our wills. This applies to all, not only parents, for we all have some sphere of influence. I do not think I am entitled to bring the Lord's will to bear on another, except in so far as it has had its effect on me; and that is a weighty matter.
Rem. I was thinking of the remark on baptism. The children are dealt with on that ground. A child is one that has been baptised and is part of the testimony, so that all the care of the Lord can be counted upon in regard to it, as for the parents.
Rem. There is to be no provocation.
C.A.C. Not to "provoke your children to anger". There is a sympathetic touch about it, for the child has to learn all that I have had to learn. It applies to our general relations to one another. We ought to bear in mind that submission has not come to pass in five minutes with ourselves. The principle of parental care is set up in the assembly, is it not?
Rem. The chief fathers come into view in every stage in Israel's history.
Rem. "For this is just", reminds us of the Lord Himself.
C.A.C. Yes, it is beautiful to think of the great principles brought in of universal application. The bondmen are to obey; well, it is a very precious feature of Christ.
Ques. Why is it "the Christ" in connection with the bondmen? (verse 5).
C.A.C. Does it not suppose a fuller development of the work of God than with the children? Those addressed in verses 5 and 6 are definitely believers, but the children would hardly be addressed on the ground that they had faith in Christ, would they?
Rem. Bondmen and masters would be a relationship
{376}
that the enemy might easily take advantage of.
C.A.C. Yes, I suppose a bondman would be peculiarly tested; we hardly understand the position. And the Lord is pleased to say that "man acquired me as bondman" (@Zechariah 13: 5). The Lord was pleased to take the lowest and most menial place, but how He glorified God as the anointed One, the Christ. It sets forth the wonderful character in which He filled the bondman's place; every detail of the bondmanship was to bring out what He was as the Christ. All that comes into this.
Onesimus came back into his relationship as bondman with a wonderful qualification that was not there before.
Rem. This makes menial relationships a wonderful opportunity for spiritual service.
C.A.C. If we thought more of spiritual features it would help us. We think of such things as liberty and opportunity to have our own pleasure. Bondmen have great restrictions, and we need to get over to the spiritual side. If my conditions are a means to set forth Christ, it ill becomes me to resent them. There is no indication that the little maid in Naaman's house wished otherwise. So you get, "In simplicity of your heart as to the Christ; not with eye-service as men-pleasers; but as bondmen of Christ, doing the will of God from the soul".
Ques. The little maid was marked by soul; is it feeling?
C.A.C. It is very beautiful and illustrates it perfectly, because she had a soul.
Rem. Paul's circumstances turned out to the furtherance of the gospel. They were no hindrance.
C.A.C. And all this widens out distinctly, as we see in verse 8. That is, he extends the principle, does he not?
Ques. What does it mean, "Receive of the Lord" (verse 8)?
C.A.C. Is it not the principle of recompense, often referred to, which God intends to govern us? It is not the
{377}
very highest motive, but many of us need the lower motives. You are quite sure of your wages, are you not?
Rem. It makes service a very dignified matter.
C.A.C. Even the apostle says, "That we ... may receive full wages" (@2 John 8). And it is absolutely certain. The person served may not appreciate it any more than the brethren, but it is sure of full recompense; it cannot possibly fail.
We need to think of all this continually in reference to all the exercises of the path. We need to find what is pleasing to the Lord and to Christ; and it is very profitable, but it is given as a motive. There is the thought too of being acceptable to men.
Rem. The Lord keeps every one of us in our true place. What is taught today is subversive of all that.
Rem. There is a beautiful example of this in the book of Ruth when Boaz said to the reapers, "Jehovah be with you", and they answered, "Jehovah bless thee", showing the right relations and the blessing in accord with it.
Rem. Though, I suppose, the Scriptures ought to regulate the relations in which we are found, all the thoughts of God should come out in them, so that what is in His mind can be seen by the world.
C.A.C. In God's account the masters are exactly on the same footing as the bondmen. "Do the same things", it says.
Rem. "Knowing that both their and your Master is in heaven".
C.A.C. It is very beautiful. You cannot but see there is a moral beauty about all this that cannot be found in the lawless world.
{378}
NOTES OF A READING @EPHESIANS 6: 10 - 20
C.A.C. It occurred to me since sitting here that this scripture carries us back to @Genesis 2.
Ques. What had you in mind?
C.A.C. Well, we read there in verse 15, "Jehovah Elohim took Man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to till it and to guard it". I think that this chapter rather answers to the guarding.
Ques. What is the difference between guarding the garden of Eden and this heavenly position?
C.A.C. Well, I think there was that set forth in the garden of Eden which was for divine pleasure; Eden means 'pleasure'. There was a scene for divine pleasure, but it needed to be guarded on account of the presence and activities of evil powers, foreknown of God as likely to molest the scene of divine pleasure. It was a warning to Adam that evil powers were about, and that it was a scene of divine pleasure that needed to be guarded. It should have intimated to Adam the peril of those wicked powers in the heavenlies; and hostile powers are jealous of God's pleasure.
If you come to the antitype of the garden in the heavenly position, it is the assembly as holding things for the divine pleasure. God's answer to those hostile powers is to set the assembly there in Christ Jesus, but that is a heavenly position that has to be guarded.
Ques. Why is *man* put to guard?
C.A.C. Well, it is a comfort and satisfaction to know that God always and under all circumstances uses the best means. It is not within the range of the creature to understand why God has permitted certain powers of evil in the universe, but He has, and is going to turn all to the great blessing and establishment of His saints in the knowledge
{379}
of Himself. Do you not think that the previous chapter of the epistle carries our minds to @Genesis 2 also very distinctly?
Ques. Does this show that the assembly is thoroughly equipped to take up the service of guarding?
C.A.C. Yes. It is as if the Spirit of God would not have this epistle finished before showing us that hostile powers are in being and are going to move against what is in mystery. So the word in this chapter is that we are to guard what is precious.
Rem. We are to be brought into it; to care for what God cares for and to guard what He guards.
C.A.C. It is entrusted to us. Paul is representative of the whole assembly. The revelation of the mystery and the unsearchable riches of the Christ were given to Paul as a representative man. He represents every one of us here, this afternoon. It is part of the honour put upon us to guard it.
Rem. There is no thought of giving way.
C.A.C. That is very fine. Scripture supposes the position can be held. The whole history of the church would lead us to think it cannot be held, but the Word of God would lead us to think that it *can* be held. If the church has given up everything heavenly, the Spirit would show us that even in the evil day it can be held.
Rem. The overcomer can "eat of the tree of life which is in the paradise of God" (@Revelation 2: 7); this is said to Ephesus.
Rem. The tree of life is still guarded when Adam and Eve were driven out, by the Cherubim and flashing sword.
C.A.C. As much as to say there was a scene of divine pleasure that was reserved.
Rem. It says, "I will give to him to eat"; that is something vital and living, and it is for the overcomer.
C.A.C. Yes.
Ques. Is the thought of the glad tidings really the entrance into the enjoyment of this?
{380}
C.A.C. Yes, because everything that God has in His purpose for man to enter into is bound up in the glad tidings. It is not one thing by itself and this another, as we often seem to think. It says, "The mystery of the glad tidings": the glad tidings are a golden casket, but if you open it you find inside the mystery. If we are brought into the presence of God, we should have the assurance of victory; God could not be defeated! For God's sons are all overcomers.
Ques. Why are we so slow to get to God's side?
C.A.C. Because we are so small; we have to grow up to these things. The seed is there and the full corn in the ear potentially. It is in every saint potentially.
Ques. Why is it called the panoply of God?
C.A.C. Is it not that we are to be in the completely furnished condition, so that we are able to guard what is so precious?
Ques. Is the idea in it that the sense of all that has come to light in Christ would make us want to respond to it and so to guard it?
C.A.C. Yes. In the garden of Eden, man was furnished with armour, but he was not using it. He had not it on at any rate. That is, obedience to God was the armour. Obedience would have preserved him from all the devices of the enemy. Obedience was the armour of an innocent creature; it would have been a perfect defence against the devices of the wicked one.
Rem. "Obey your parents", "obey masters", etc. Obedience is emphasised in this chapter.
C.A.C. We were saying that these are principles of universal application. This question of obedience is of vital importance. If we only moved in the path of obedience, we should be a match for all the devices of the enemy. The Lord was furnished with armour in His place as Man; He was found with armour on.
J.N.D. said there were only two exercises of life to God;
{381}
one is obedience, the other is praise. That covers everything.
Rem. I wondered if failure with Adam was made good in Christ. There seems a suggestion in verse 10 of something of that sort prior to taking and putting on the armour. The man must first be strong enough to carry it.
C.A.C. I am sure that is very important. Were you thinking that in the Lord there is One who has met and overcome every hostile power? So now if we are strong, it is in Him. The Spirit of God never sets us up with conscious strength in ourselves.
Rem. Christ showed perfection of obedience.
C.A.C. And He spoke so beautifully of Himself. "As I also have overcome" (@Revelation 3: 21). He has not referred much to His pathway here, but there are some very choice references, and this is one, as if to say, I want you to think of Me on that line.
Rem. Joshua was told to be strong and of good courage.
C.A.C. And the Captain of Jehovah's host was there, which rather fits in here.
Ques. Could you help us as to why the panoply is spoken of as a complete unit, before the details of each particular part is given?
C.A.C. Is it not to show us that the complete thing is needed? "Panoply" is complete furnishing; we cannot dispense with any part -- it is a unit.
Rem. It is "that ye may be able to stand against the artifices of the devil".
C.A.C. Yes, and I think his artifices come out particularly in his quoting Scripture.
Ques. What form would that take now?
C.A.C. Oh, a brother gets up and gives an address, every word out of the Scripture, yet his object might be to nullify the word that the Lord is giving at the present time; anything that would turn the minds of the saints away from
{382}
the present ministry of the Spirit would be artifices of the devil. All opposition is apparently based on the Scriptures, but all is to nullify the riches that God would give the saints. I think the devil often operates through the saints. Often he is careful to take up a capable and intelligent man for his purpose. Some of the greatest men in the church have been used to nullify the truth. That is some of the artifices of the devil.
Ques. What would help us against this?
C.A.C. I suppose a greater value in our souls of the ministry of Paul and John.
Rem. So the great thought is the Spirit's voice to the assembly.
C.A.C. I thought so. In a certain sense there is no development from the ministry of Paul or John; you have the complete thought of God. There has been a bringing out of the complete thought of God in the last hundred years. If so, we shall be very fearful of anything being taken from that.
The importance of this panoply of God is that every part of it has to do with our state. You see the loins girt about with truth, the breastplate of righteousness, the feet shod, the shield of faith and the helmet of salvation all have to do with our moral state, and you will find it is want of moral state that leaves us open to be turned aside by the artifices of the devil. It is not exactly the absence of the truth, but the absence of moral state.
Ques. "Having girt about your loins with truth"; would you explain that?
C.A.C. I wish you would say something about that.
Ques. In relation to moral state, is that why Paul speaking to Timothy stresses "faith and a good conscience" (@1 Timothy 1: 19)?
C.A.C. Yes, indeed, and we are to be inwardly controlled by the truth. Our loins would represent our inward state of affection. All is to be kept within the control
{383}
of the truth.
Rem. Peter says, "Having girded up the loins of your mind, be sober and hope with perfect stedfastness" (@1 Peter 1: 13). John speaks too of his children walking in truth (@2 John 4).
C.A.C. Yes, it is most important, because the truth is a thing that is now fully out. You could hardly speak of truth in the Old Testament, because when you come to the real substance of the truth, Christ is the truth, and the Spirit is the truth. Truth in the Old Testament is more the quality of persons; the truth had not come out fully. It is one of those things that subsist in Jesus Christ. We are to be controlled in our feelings about things; our affections are to be controlled by what has come out in Christ and in the Spirit. The enemy cannot attack that state of things.
Ques. Peter moved rashly. Is it something like that with us?
C.A.C. Yes, I think so.
Ques. Would it have to do with the revelation of God; would it bring God in?
C.A.C. Yes, indeed.
Ques. Would the latter part of chapter 4 have a bearing on it, "having put on the new man"?
C.A.C. Yes, I think very much so.
Rem. The answer to it brings in the new man.
C.A.C. Yes, quite so.
Ques. Is this holding the inheritance?
C.A.C. I think it is included in what is to be guarded.
Ques. Would you say a little more about the moral state? It is there we are very weak; we know how things should be, but are not up to them often, so is it the moral state underlying?
C.A.C. Yes, the breastplate of righteousness is very important in that connection; it means that things are right with us.
Rem. It is very like Christ loving righteousness.
{384}
Rem. The breastplate protected the heart. It is what the heart is set for.
C.A.C. And righteousness would extend to the spiritual realm. There are a vast number of things there that are unrighteous. Those things believers are to withdraw from. "Withdraw from iniquity" is really, 'Withdraw from what is not right' (@2 Timothy 2: 19).
Rem. In @John 13, the Lord girds Himself there for service. I wondered whether "girt about ... with truth" would be for service.
C.A.C. Yes, I think so, it is part of the armour. A soldier generally has a belt, has he not?
Ques. Are you confining this to the heavenly sphere, strength required there?
C.A.C. Yes, I think the object of the enemy is to rob us of what is unfolded in this epistle. The glory of God is seen in this epistle, all that is connected with Christ in heaven. Satan is particularly against what is set up in Christ in heaven. He is not particularly against a beautiful life on earth. It is one of his artifices to get persons occupied with the life of Jesus as a model for us to build up a human righteousness that shuts out the righteousness of God. It is not only that Christ is in heaven, but the saints are there.
Rem. The hymn says,
<blockquote>'He's gone within the veil, <br>For us that place has won'. (`12:2)</blockquote>
C.A.C. That is the truth, I am sure. So that righteousness in the saints would be consistent with the heavenly position. It is not righteous to take up a religious position on the earth. People who belong to sects, to systems on earth, are positively unrighteous.
I suppose the fact that our feet are to be shod shows we are intended to be moving about. It supposes that the heavenly company will be found in movement in connection with the glad tidings of peace. Perhaps it would
{385}
preserve us from some of the artifices of the devil, if we were a little more active on our feet.
Rem. Standing is stressed, but it is all in view of moving in what is to be maintained here.
Ques. Why is it "of peace"? This is a state of war.
C.A.C. Yes, but it is a warfare in which the service of the glad tidings has an important place, so that the truth is not to be maintained merely passively, but actively in the testimony of the glad tidings of peace. The thing is to be maintained.
Rem. It is a question of mutual encouragement.
C.A.C. Yes. It is part of the equipment. So the preaching of the gospel is an important element in the spiritual conflict.
Ques. "Preparation", it says. What is the thought of moral preparation?
C.A.C. Yes, it seems to suggest that the glad tidings of peace have had an effect on the movements of the saints.
Rem. It says in @Romans 3, "Swift their feet to shed blood"; which is just the opposite.
C.A.C. Yes, now the saints do know the way of peace, and they are active in it. I heard of where gospel preaching was given up because no one came in to listen. That is a bad principle.
Rem. "How beautiful the feet of them that announce the glad tidings of peace, of them that announce glad tidings of good things" (@Romans 10: 15).
C.A.C. So that the gospel should be preached by those who have the whole precious truth in mind. So that it is a gospel preached, however simply, and however elementary the subjects presented may be, that is consistent with the full thoughts of God.
So that where the truth is held, people should have a different gospel from anywhere else. It should be presented differently.
Rem. And the gospel is not limited to once a week.
{386}
C.A.C. No, you must wear your shoes all the week.
Rem. In @Luke 15 the thought is that the father should have his son. There is something for the father's heart in it.
C.A.C. That is the idea.
Rem. "This my son"; what it must have meant to him!
C.A.C. Yes, indeed.
{387}
NOTES OF A READING @EPHESIANS 6: 14 - 24
Rem. We did not say anything about the shield of faith last time, did we?
C.A.C. Had you anything in your mind?
Rem. It seems a very important part of the panoply of God. It is the dispensation which is in faith, and I suppose faith is always being called forth. "With which ye will be able to quench all the inflamed darts of the wicked one". Would you say something about it? If faith is living and operative these darts do not penetrate; is that it?
C.A.C. It is evident the faith is protective. What are "the inflamed darts of the wicked one"? One would like to draw out some of the wealth present.
Ques. Was the suggestion to the woman in the garden of this character? It came from the wicked one.
C.A.C. Yes, I think that is helpful.
Rem. When Peter said to the Lord, "God be favourable to thee, Lord" (@Matthew 16: 22), the Lord recognised it was satanic, that it came from Satan.
C.A.C. Yes.
Ques. Would you say the attempt in the garden was to undermine the confidence of our first parents in God? "Ye will be as God, knowing good and evil" (@Genesis 3: 5). You said last week the armour was there, but they did not avail themselves of it.
C.A.C. Yes, showing that we are not protected by being passive; that is, taking the panoply with all its different parts is an active matter -- something to do in an active sense.
Ques. Is it taken up together or individually?
C.A.C. Well, I thought it regards the saints as set together to defend the precious things which are deposited in the assembly. All the most precious and wealthy
{388}
thoughts of God have now been brought to light and they are committed to the assembly, or to the saints who form it. It supposes a *body* of warriors, not simply one soldier, but Jehovah's host.
Ques. I wondered if in a way the enemy is against us as set together as in the faith order of things?
C.A.C. I think we need to see that, for we tend to come under the influence of what is seen. Things outwardly may seem weak and small; they did to some of the remnant who returned in the time of which Ezra writes. What God was doing in their day they esteemed as nothing. "Is it not as nothing in your eyes?" (@Haggai 2: 3). Satan would like us to think the precious things of God of no account, and so would occupy us with the weakness and smallness of things to make us discouraged and disheartened.
Rem. Yes, and that is why you do not get anything about the greatness of God here. In chapter 1 you have the "surpassing greatness of his power", in chapter 2 the "surpassing riches of his grace", and in chapter 3 the love of the Christ which "surpasses knowledge". They are the surpassing things.
C.A.C. That is very good. The enemy's attack is not exactly against us, but against what is of God. The wonderful deposit is of God. It has often been said if we are not in some sense standing in the truth in this epistle, we shall not get this conflict. So that the faith which would protect us is really faith in the heavenly. It is a particular quality of faith, not exactly the faith of the early stages of the soul. It is faith in a comprehensive sense as embracing the most precious thoughts of God. Nothing will ever be made known to us greater than what we get in this epistle; and the enemy will take it away, steal it from us, if he possibly can. But we are to guard it.
Rem. There is a note to "inflamed darts" in the Darby translation suggesting their effect is to destroy.
C.A.C. Quite so.
{389}
Ques. Would you say that faith puts the soul in touch with God, is light in the soul in that way, and that this opposition would be dissipated by saints in touch with God as to the issue of things?
C.A.C. Yes, and faith apprehends the present mind of God, so that it is not the same quality of faith that an Old Testament saint had, or that a millennial saint will have, but the faith that is proper to this wondrous moment in the ways of God, and what Satan will do his best to destroy. We might say that in the christian profession generally the precious truth of this epistle has been quite taken away, the faith of it is not present as an active principle.
Ques. Is that how the darts would take effect?
C.A.C. "In the evil day", it says -- "That ye may be able to withstand in the evil day", which seems to look on to the day when these things would be challenged. That is the evil day, and we have fallen upon it, but just in this particular time there is a remnant to withstand. It is the greatest honour God has ever put upon saints.
*We* have the pick of everything. We have far more than the Old Testament saints had, and we are better off than the saints were at Pentecost, for they had not then the ministry of Paul at all, or the ministry of John. That is, the very choicest truth was not in the assembly at Pentecost. It came in after. I think Pentecost was the fulfilment of Old Testament promise. But we have got something that far surpasses all in the Old Testament. It was hidden then. It was something God cherished as a hidden treasure. He brought it out through Paul, and John could stand in it. And here we are with it as the substance of the faith in our souls today. Oh, let us be careful that we hold every particle of it! The more others do not value it, the more we should value it. Their not valuing it should stimulate us, it should stir us up to value it very much.
Rem. "That the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts" (chapter 3: 17); is that it?
{390}
C.A.C. Yes, because it is clearly Christ in heaven, it is a glorified Man in heaven. It is a question of faith, and the highest quality of faith we could have, the top-stone of faith that makes the heart a dwelling-place of the glorified Christ. How wonderful to get into a believer's heart, if we could dissect it, and find Christ enshrined there as the most precious object in it, and therefore the whole truth of the mystery and of the assembly bound up with it.
We start with the centre, God does not occupy us with an expanse of glory, but with a *Person*, glorified, who is the centre of the glory and of the mystery.
Rem. And it is not only in Christ, but in the saints: "That now to the principalities and authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the assembly the all-various wisdom of God" (chapter 3: 10).
C.A.C. Yes, a wonderful thing, because it is not only the saints looking up into heaven, but heaven looking down upon the saints. It used to be said that there was a particular mark of people in fellowship.
Ques. Perhaps you would say what that is?
C.A.C. That the epistle to the Ephesians was very dirty in their Bibles!
God is much before us in this epistle. In Colossians it is Christ that is much before us, so Colossians must be first. In Ephesians we come to the fulness of God -- what is according to God in His present unfolding, the faith of that in our souls. We have no idea what a joy it is to the blessed God to bring us into His secrets.
This epistle contemplates the fulness and completeness of the divine thoughts, and the saints growing up together into the blessedness of them.
Rem. The saints are put together in this epistle, "that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts"; and it goes on to speak of the whole company entering into it: "That ye may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height; and to
{391}
know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge". It is "all the saints".
C.A.C. They are all necessary to it. All the saints are needed to fill out the great plan. It gives one a wonderful outlook on the saints. We are inclined to look at them after the flesh. That would be some of the fiery darts taking effect. It would be a distracting sort of thing to have fiery darts sticking into you. The enemy would use anything distracting. So we need to have the faith of these things, not only to look at and admire them.
Rem. You get the thing in your heart. Caleb had all along the land in his heart, and God in his heart. All the rest spoke against it but Caleb and Joshua in their presence stood for it. *Then* the glory of God appeared; He would support that.
Rem. It is not only that Christ is heavenly, but the saints are heavenly as linked with Him.
C.A.C. This epistle would show that, and we love them always from that point of view; they are essential for the bringing in of all this.
Rem. There is much in Colossians and Ephesians of faith in Christ and love to all the saints. It must take them all in.
C.A.C. Even if you have no knowledge of them personally; it is not only those you are in contact with.
Rem. The Lord took in the whole assembly when He went into death.
C.A.C. The Lord represents them all. We sit down in relatively small companies, but there are the "many".
The apostle speaks as if there was only one loaf and one cup universally. "The bread which we break", "the cup of blessing which we bless" (@1 Corinthians 10: 16). It is a very expansive thought. And there is an extension of the body in the saints. "We ... are ... one body", it says. Now first in the loaf you would think of the personal body of the Lord; then you would move on to the thought of the saints as the
{392}
loaf. "We, being many, are one loaf, one body; for we all partake of that one loaf". For all the saints morally partake of Christ. It is delightful to God that our affections should move on those lines in the assembly, and it should have an effect on us through the week.
I think the first impression that God makes on a soul is the value of the saints. My first impression was, what a wonderful company the saints were and what an honour to be amongst them. I think it works that way. The young believer has very great thoughts of Christ, and he thinks, 'They love Christ better than I do; well, I would like to be with them'. Is not that the proper way of coming into fellowship? We had better keep on that line, too. You could not be nervous of expressing yourself in such a company, where what is said of Christ finds an echo in every heart.
Ques. The helmet of salvation, does that come in in the same connection?
C.A.C. It would have to do with your head. This epistle is full of glory; does not the sense of glory keep your head up in the sense of salvation?
It is said of the Lord Himself, that "he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation upon his head" (@Isaiah 59: 17). It is salvation in a sense in which the Lord could know it.
Ques. Had the enemy come in in destroy the inheritance of Jehovah?
C.A.C. I suppose it refers to the time when the Lord comes out to subjugate all that is evil in a victorious way.
Rem. That scripture seems to help the particular chapter we are looking at. He comes to Zion, and there is the thought of what goes through. "My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith Jehovah, from henceforth and for ever" (verse 21). It is a triumph, that.
Israel's day to
{393}
C.A.C. Yes, so "the sword of the Spirit, which is God's word" comes in there.
Rem. In 1 Thessalonians it is the "hope of salvation" (chapter 5: 8), a more elementary thought there, while here in this epistle it is a very complete thought of salvation.
C.A.C. Yes, so that one is set free to handle the sword of the Spirit which is God's word, with no fear.
Ques. Does the Lord use the sword in the temptation?
C.A.C. Yes, I should think so, and the sword of the Spirit which is God's word is perhaps of wider bearing than the Scriptures.
Ques. What have you in mind?
C.A.C. Well, I think God's word would be what expressed the mind of God at any particular time.
Rem. It would have a wider bearing in @Hebrews 13: 7, "Remember your leaders who have spoken to you the word of God".
C.A.C. The word of God would include all that the Spirit says to the assemblies. "The sword of the Spirit". The Spirit can give us the present mind of God with reference to any circumstance that arises as a question of the testimony.
If really full of the Holy Spirit we should have the right word for everybody, every caviller and objector. We feel our need for it, and we feel sad when we do not have it.
Rem. It should be aggressive warfare.
C.A.C. I thought so, so that any effort of the enemy to oppose it brings out the truth more clearly and fully; so that we ought not to be afraid of conflict. And personally we find it confirming. There is nothing like a little conflict for helping us to value the truth.
{394}
NOTES OF A READING @EPHESIANS 6: 17 - 24
Rem. I suppose the armour is not much use unless there is the constant prayer spoken of here.
C.A.C. I was thinking that. It is noticeable that after being fully equipped we should be exhorted to pray.
Ques. What is the apostle exactly referring to when he says, "Watching unto this very thing"?
C.A.C. I suppose he would have us to realise the importance of vigilance in regard of prayer. We not only pray, but we watch; that is, we are on the watch for answers to our prayers.
Ques. Is there some connection between that and the previous verse, "Have also the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is God's word"? The apostle links the sword of the Spirit with the helmet of salvation -- I wondered whether it is in view of the testimony, and then there is praying and watching.
C.A.C. I think attention is to be given to this matter of prayer. It is not to be a formal matter, but an active business of the soul, communication with God in reference to His will and His work.
Rem. "I give myself unto prayer", David said (@Psalm 109: 4). It is a remarkable statement. Would that be it?
C.A.C. Yes, and the apostles said, "*We* will give ourselves up to prayer and the ministry of the word" (@Acts 6: 4).
Ques. Would it include the spirit of prayer, a constant attitude?
C.A.C. He does not say, 'Have a week of prayer or a special day of prayer'. It is praying at all seasons.
Rem. Nehemiah seems to fit the case.
C.A.C. Well, go on.
Rem. He was concerned about Jerusalem, but he had
{395}
to take up prayer in his captivity.
C.A.C. Yes, quite so. It supposes that we understand what is in the mind of God for all the saints. It is great enlargement here; it is not at all our own matters we are told to pray about, it is God's matters. It has all the saints in mind. It is praying in the mind of the Spirit, so it could not be limited.
Ques. Why is it prayer and supplication, is that some definite and specific request?
C.A.C. Yes, I thought so. Prayer is more general, but intercession and supplication are definite and particular. Perhaps the best word for it would be 'petition', a particular request like Epaphras made. He agonised for the Colossians that they might stand perfect and complete in all God's will -- a very definite petition. He did not simply say, 'Bless the saints in Colosse'. We are often too general in our requests. That is better than nothing, but I think God would have us present special requests, something definite.
Rem. It is valuable to know how our brethren are going on in different parts of the world so as to be intelligent in our supplications for them.
C.A.C. It is very pleasing to God that we should have something definite to ask for the saints at any particular time.
Rem. "If two of you shall agree", the Lord says (@Matthew 18: 19). It is something definite that you ask for.
Rem. It seems to come in very fittingly at the close of this great epistle.
C.A.C. It is as if the apostle would have all that he has ministered in this epistle turned into prayer and supplication. All the saints are in view in this epistle, it is not a local epistle exactly.
Rem. We see the great scope of it in his own two great prayers in chapters 1 and 3.
C.A.C. Yes. Well, they are very definite, are they not? He realised it was most important that the saints should
{396}
have the things that he prayed for. It is a great privilege; there could hardly be a greater than to be brought into the current of God's mind about all saints, it being not a question of circumstances, but what is His mind for all saints, and then particularly for the apostle. He would have them right at the centre of those interests; that is, Paul was in that sense at the centre, he was the one to whom this great ministry was committed.
Rem. It is remarkable how the great operations of God seem linked up with and concentrated in the saints. They focus themselves there.
C.A.C. Indeed, it is so, and we have to look at the saints from that standpoint, the standpoint of what is in God's mind in regard to them.
Ques. In that way would our prayers take character from the Lord's prayer in @John 17?
C.A.C. Yes, surely that is the most wonderful prayer ever offered, and it shows how the Lord regards the saints -- "Those who believe on me through their word". It is first the apostles and then it widens out to all that believe on Him.
Ques. "An ambassador bound with a chain". Is that in connection with what the Lord says, "As the Father sent me forth, I also send you" (@John 20: 21)?
C.A.C. The great thoughts of God came out more fully when the apostle was outwardly restricted. How wonderfully God works. What seems to be the greatest hindrance to His work turns out to be what helps most. When Paul was in chains he did more than he ever did travelling from Jerusalem round about to Illyricum.
Ques. Why is it "the mystery of the glad tidings"?
C.A.C. Well, I suppose that all that is bound up in the glad tidings should be made known. The mystery of the assembly is all bound up in the glad tidings. The glad tidings are proclaimed, but there is a great deal bound up in them that is not on the surface. "Mystery" is a characteristic
{397}
word in christianity and has a special place in the ministry of Paul. Certain things require to be looked into that are not obvious and have to be enquired into. The glad tidings are public.
Ques. To what does this refer, "That utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth to make known with boldness the mystery of the glad tidings"?
C.A.C. Well, I think he has in mind all that was bound up in the glad tidings. He looked abroad in the church and saw no doubt comparatively few who were intelligent in the great thoughts God had in mind in sending His Son; he realised that the secret bound up in the gospel was not much understood. I think he had the feeling as to the Roman saints that they must be established in the gospel and then go on to understand the mystery, which is really unfolded in this epistle.
Rem. The Lord said, "To you is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God" (@Mark 4: 11), when He was alone with His disciples.
C.A.C. Yes, it required interested persons. If not interested we shall not get into these things that are known as mysteries. It is for us to see that we are intensely interested in everything that has its origin in God, not only the gospel but in all that lies behind the gospel. Paul does not pray to have greater knowledge of the mystery, but to have ability to open his mouth boldly to make it known; so I suppose that everyone who has tried to minister the word at all feels he has something to present and has been troubled with his own inability to get it out. I have known what it is to have something to present, but not to be able to get it out.
Rem. Sometimes it is too great to put into words.
C.A.C. Sometimes it is that, it is too great to express. It was not that the apostle had not got it all, for he had it by revelation.
Rem. There was the question of the Gentiles being
{398}
brought in.
C.A.C. And I think it supposes it is going to be difficult to present it to saints. When you come to present it, it is a difficult matter to do it, so that people get hold of it. It shows how the Lord's servants need our prayers, so that when they open their mouths they may be helped. They want special help then, and they will fail to bring out what is in their hearts if we do not pray for them.
Ques. Would speaking loudly enough to be heard enter into it? It is desirable that what is said should be heard and known.
Ques. How would you define the gospel, if asked?
C.A.C. I think I should shrink from defining it; that is putting a line round it; it is rather too big for that.
Ques. We rather limit it in our minds. Is it not all God's thoughts in Christ?
C.A.C. Yes.
Rem. You once said it could be put into three words, "Behold your God" (@Isaiah 40: 9). Wonderful words.
C.A.C. Yes, it is the presentation of God, really what God is for man, a poor, ruined creature.
Rem. Jehovah says, "I will work, and who shall hinder it?" and then He says, "I will give waters in the wilderness, rivers in the waste, to give drink to my people, my chosen. This people have I formed for myself: they shall shew forth my praise" (@Isaiah 43: 13, 20, 21). Nothing can hinder what God is going to bring about, the rivers flowing, etc.
Rem. It is every divine thought that God has for His creature centred in Christ.
C.A.C. And the assembly is the climax of everything. Now is the time when all the secrets are out, but they are only made known to interested persons.
Rem. Many Christians are happy with having their personal difficulties solved, and the rest they put off to a day to come. They are lacking in the mystery, would you say?
{399}
C.A.C. I think that is so, and God would be very pleased if saints would ask Him to show them His glory. Moses prayed, "Let me ... see thy glory" (@Exodus 33: 18). That is a very good prayer. It is a great matter to pray about. I know of some who spent years in praying that God would show them His glory.
The most wonderful thing in the universe is the glory of God; and when everything is broken down on the side of the creature, God brings out not only His grace, but His glory. God is going to have a vessel suitable to carry His glory to the age of the ages; but it is His glory that is going to be there, and that glory is in the assembly now, it is really the vessel of divine glory now.
Ques. Paul's sending Tychicus to them was that they might pray for his definite needs, I suppose?
C.A.C. It was important that the saints should be interested in Paul himself. He did not detail that in the epistle, "how I am getting on"; it was a most important matter for the saints to be interested in Paul.
Rem. That points today to the saints being interested in a special way in anyone raised up to minister with gift.
C.A.C. The more gifted a man is, the more claim he has on our prayers, you would say. We ought to take special interest in those who are particularly gifted in bringing out the mind of God. They are our property as belonging to us; "Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, ... all are yours" (@1 Corinthians 3: 22); and if our property we should be greatly interested.
Rem. It is sometimes difficult to know them.
C.A.C. It is important to know, and our prayers should follow any who are special vessels of ministry in that way. It is most important for us to get a universal outlook, to look out at the saints as a whole, not only those in our locality, but to look abroad and see what the Lord is doing universally; we have a good deal of means of knowing. There is a beloved brother, well known to us,
{400}
who is hindered from being with his brethren in New Zealand; well, we should be enquiring why the Lord has checked his movements.
Rem. It is not always easy to get information; perhaps more might be supplied.
C.A.C. We should try and get hold of Tychicus, *he* knows. Well, get hold of him; he is ready to tell all he knows about Paul! The personal side of things is left to be communicated personally, it is not put in writing. Personal communications are most important among the brethren.
Ques. "Our affairs". Whom is he linking himself with there?
C.A.C. I think he is using the plural pretty much as an application to himself. There was no other ambassador in Rome, he is the only one. The interests of Christ, of heaven, of God had been formally committed to Paul as an ambassador, so what happened to him was of vital importance to the whole assembly.
Ques. Would you say a word on the last two verses?
C.A.C. Well, it is like the apostle lifting up his hands in blessing upon us at the end of his ministry, is it not?
Ques. Why is it "love with faith"? It is striking that faith should be put in this salutation, but it is here.
C.A.C. I suppose it is a necessary blend, "love with faith". If we love the saints, that concerns all that is in the mind of God in regard to them, and faith takes account of that, so love is accompanied by faith.
Ques. "That the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts" (chapter 3: 17). It seems connected with the whole vast system of glory; it requires faith. Is that why he speaks of incorruptible affections at the close?
C.A.C. Such affections are found in the assembly.
They are not found anywhere else, are they?
{401}
EPISTLE TO THE PHILIPPIANS
{402}
{403}
GOD'S WORK IN US, AND HIS WAY WITH US
@Philippians 1: 6, 19 - 21, 27 - 30; @Philippians 2: 12 - 16; @Philippians 3: 20, 21
I suppose every reader of this epistle must have noticed that there is very little of what we should call doctrine in it. It is an epistle of experience. The apostle addresses the Philippians, not on the ground of the general facts and truths of christianity, but on the ground of God's work in them, and I think it was a great comfort to him to be able to write to them on that ground.
In writing his first epistle to the Corinthians he could not address them on the ground of the work of God in them. He had to address them on the ground of the facts and testimony of christianity as it had been developed among them by himself. But when they had repented and judged themselves as the effect of that epistle, he took a different line in the second epistle, and addressed them on the ground of the work of God in them.
So in this epistle to the Philippians. The apostle's confidence as to them was that God had begun a work in them. "Having confidence of this very thing, that he who has begun in you a good work will complete it unto Jesus Christ's day" (chapter 1: 6). The work of God in souls may be hindered, and a great deal of rubbish may accumulate over it, but it can never be undone or set aside; and God will complete His work unto Jesus Christ's day.
The nature of God's work in us comes out in chapter 2: 13, "For it is God who works in you both the willing and the working according to his good pleasure". I am sure it is of the greatest importance to see what is involved in this. There could be neither the willing nor the doing of God's pleasure apart from Christ, for it is in Him that God finds "good pleasure". It is by God's work in us that we desire that Christ should be magnified in our bodies. Man in the
{404}
flesh is a total failure, but there is another Man in whom God finds "good pleasure". God gives us the consciousness that there is a Man in whom He finds His good pleasure, and He puts our desires and our activities on the line of that Man, and thus works in us to will and to do of His good pleasure. God's good pleasure finds its eternal rest and satisfaction in Christ. It is not only that there is a Saviour for man at his worst, but man at his best has been displaced and thrown into the shade by Christ.
Saul of Tarsus was an expression of man at his best. Perhaps we can hardly understand such a man, one who never consciously violated a command of God, one who lived in good conscience before God, and was invested with every distinction and privilege that God could give to a man according to the flesh, so that he could say, "If any other think to trust in flesh, I rather" (chapter 3: 4). He excelled every other man, and yet what does he say? "But what things were gain to me these I counted, on account of Christ, loss. But surely I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all, and count them to be filth, that I may gain Christ" (verses 7, 8). There you see man at his very best, with every advantage and distinction God could give him; yet Paul says, 'I throw all that aside as worthless because another Man has displaced and thrown into the shade everything that was my boast and glory as in the flesh'.
Beloved friends, it is by the work of God in us that we come into the apprehension of Christ as the Object of His good pleasure. It is an immense thing to see the greatness of Christianity, and to discern that everything centres in Christ! In the very opening of the New Testament, what a variety of divine testimony finds its blessed centre in Him. An angel appears to Joseph to speak of Him; there is also the testimony of the Scriptures to Him; then there was the star -- light from heaven: every kind of divine testimony to that
{405}
blessed One. The action of the Spirit, the ministry of angels, the witness of Scripture and light from heaven were all in harmony, and all centred in the virgin's Son, Immanuel, the Christ of God. If you are interested to think of the pleasure of God, it is an immense thing to find that God has secured good pleasure for Himself in a Man; that is, in Christ.
In the beginning of Matthew, Herod is a type of the man in possession of the earth. He had the throne, though he was only the puppet of a power greater than himself. Man is apparently in possession of the earth, but he is only the puppet of a power greater than himself -- the power of Satan.
A fine building in England carries the inscription carved in stone, 'There is nothing great on earth but man'. Man after the flesh is in possession of the earth, and he hates Christ. As soon as God's Man came in, the man of the earth, represented by Herod, would have shut the door in His face if possible. Man in the flesh does not want another Man -- he does not want a Man of a divine order and of divine character; he would rather be left alone to indulge his lusts. But, on the other hand, we see God's work in Joseph and in the wise men who came from the east. Joseph -- type of the Jewish remnant -- received the infant Jesus, and was content to suffer with Him. He went away into banishment on account of Christ being rejected. Then in the wise men coming up from the east we see a figure of the Gentiles coming up to worship the One who was of no account at all in this world. I allude to this as an illustration of how God works in the hearts of men so that they may appreciate what is according to His good pleasure. When the Christ of God came into this world there were those who could appreciate Him, who received Him and worshipped Him and suffered with Him; and that is Christianity in picture.
It is clear that in the first place new birth is essential for this. There is no disposition in man to receive Christ apart
{406}
from being born anew; the natural man does not like Christ; he would, like Herod, kill Him. People think that christian England is very different from Judaea; but man is unchanged -- there is not a bit of difference really between the first century and the nineteenth; there is no place for God's Man in this world, and His rejection and death have proved it. God has to work in man to produce appreciation of Christ. Hence, "It is needful that *ye* should be born anew" (@John 3: 7). There must be a divine work in man, and a work that sets aside everything of man. A man may have been an important man in this world -- a prime minister, or king -- but when he is born anew, what is the effect? Sooner or later he is compelled to take his place before God as nothing but a lost sinner. All his greatness, his human glory, his fancied moral excellence, come to nothing; he is just a lost sinner under death and judgment. However good he may have been, however religious, however competent, when God touches him he finds that all that he was as in the flesh is worthless; whether moral, religious, philosophic, or whatever it may have been, all is worthless, and does not yield a bit of good pleasure to God.
It is not Christ! If I as a man in this world had the most beautiful moral character it would not be Christ; it would only be the character of a fallen creature -- of a sinner. It might be gilded and decorated, but, after all, it would be the character of a sinner; it would give God no pleasure.
God's pleasure centres in Christ. And in connection with the grace of God we may note two things: a divine work in man which brings to nothing all the pretensions of man, and, on the other hand, the preaching of Christ. These two things are clearly seen in this epistle. When Paul refers to the gospel he speaks of it as the preaching of Christ, "Christ is announced and in this I rejoice, yea, also I will rejoice"
(chapter 1: 18); and again in verse 27, "Only conduct yourselves worthily of the glad tidings of the Christ". The great thing in connection with the gospel is that it is the
{407}
presentation of Christ; God is pleased to set forth to man by the gospel the One who is according to His good pleasure, and I am quite sure Satan has done and will do his best to obscure that gospel. There are but very few in christendom who have really apprehended the thought that there is an anointed Man in whom God's good pleasure is found eternally, and in whom every blessing is established for men. But those in whom God has worked the willing and the doing of His good pleasure receive Christ, and rejoice in Him. In the case of Joseph and the wise men from the east, God worked in them the willing and the doing of His good pleasure. His good pleasure was in that blessed One who had come into the world, and these men's desires and actions all found their centre in Him. In proportion as God has wrought in souls they find their object and pleasure in Christ, because He is the One who ministers good pleasure to the heart of God.
And, beloved friends, it is an immense thing to view the Lord Jesus Christ in this way, for in this way God brings us into the presence of perfection. We are brought from our own imperfection to all the blessed perfection that is found in Christ. We are brought to perfection by being brought into the presence of Him in whom perfection is, and that is Christ. Christians as such are brought to perfection; that is, they are brought to Christ. I am not speaking now of how far this may be true of individual souls, or of the mass of professors, but of what christianity is in its own proper fulness and blessing; it is to be brought to Christ. What is the meaning of the name Christian if it does not mean one brought to Christ? And if we are brought to Christ, and appreciate Christ, and our desires are centred in Christ, have we not come to perfection? Have we not found every moral excellence and beauty in Christ? God feeds His work in our souls by the perfection of Christ; God sets Him before us, and feeds our souls upon perfection: "*He* also who eats me shall live also on account of me" (@John 6: 57).
{408}
God would feed our souls and nourish us on the perfections of Christ. Do you not think that if our souls fed upon the perfections of Christ, and if we knew how to digest and assimilate those perfections into our moral being, we should become a little more like Him? That is how it works. If I am down in my soul, if I am not displaying the grace of Christ, you may depend upon it there is no way of getting me into the right current except by increasing my appetite for Christ. There is no other way, and the work of God in us must be on that line. God works in us to give an appetite for, and appreciation of Christ; He works in us to enable us to feed upon the blessed perfections of the One who is the Object of His good pleasure.
In @Philippians 2 He is presented as having come down here, bringing all the grace of heaven and all the perfection of His own Person into this world. And how does He behave Himself? What characterises Him in that place of humiliation? Lowliness of mind, subjection, and obedience. I often think of those words, "They are not of the world, as I am not of the world" (@John 17: 6). Beloved brethren, do we ever consider in what way He was not of the world?
Scripture tells us that all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life (@1 John 2: 16). That is what we are naturally; we are made up of these three defiling things, none of which is of the Father, but of the world. But look at Him, and what do we see? Divine love instead of the lust of the flesh, divine light instead of the lust of the eyes, and divine lowliness instead of the pride of life. He was not of the world. There was not a single feature in common between Christ and the world. People think Christ has come here to elevate man -- to add lustre and perfection to man as in the flesh. But how could God bring the character of the heavenly One into association with the character of the earthly one -- man in the flesh? They could not be made to touch at any point.
One man is characterised by the lust of the flesh, the lust of
{409}
the eyes, and the pride of life; and the other by divine love, and divine light, and divine lowliness. How could these two things be mingled together? Impossible! As a natural man I am a creature of self-will and lust. Could God ever have any pleasure in me? Not a bit. And there was a necessity that Christ should make an end of my history in the sight of God, for if my history had not been closed up at the cross, God could never have blessed me; I must have sunk under the weight of my own damnation into the lake of fire.
Thank God for the cross! The Man of God's good pleasure took a place on the cross, where He was made *sacrificially* what we are *personally*. He was made sin, and bore the judgment of sin, and went into death, so that the whole history of the man of lust and self-will was brought to its end under the eye of God upon the cross. We were under death, and that peerless, perfect One came in love to where sin had brought us, so that our history as in the flesh might be ended in His death. But this was all in view of our being linked up with His perfection, and invested with His beauty before the eye of God for ever, and that we might be set free to feed upon all that moral beauty which has shone out so perfectly in Him.
Young believers are often greatly deceived by things in this world. We read books that deceive and hinder us. The world has its heroes and its great men -- men of wonderful abilities and genius -- and we may read books that speak of them, and get to admire them, and think highly of them, without pausing to ask ourselves whether God has any pleasure in them. In this way we come to admire moral qualities which are exactly opposite to the character of the lowly and holy qualities of Christ. We need a more distinct breach between our hearts and the world, and men of the world. Think of the gracious and holy character of Christ. He "emptied himself, taking a bondman's form, taking his place in the likeness of men; and having been found in figure as a man, humbled himself, becoming obedient even
{410}
unto death, and that the death of the cross" (chapter 2: 7, 8). That is the pathway of One who yielded nothing but good pleasure to the heart of God. And God causes it to pass before our hearts that we may feed upon it, and thus He works in us the willing and the doing of His good pleasure.
Having spoken thus about *God's work in us*, I want now to say a few words about *God's way with us*. God not only does a work in us, but He has a way with us. We get a reference to this in chapter l: 19, "For I know that this shall turn out for me to salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ". God's way with Paul might well have seemed strange to flesh and blood. He was a special vessel of God's testimony, the great evangelist, the great teacher and apostle; but instead of being free for his work, he was at this time shut up in prison. Had anything gone wrong? Was Paul discouraged?
In no wise, for he says, "I know that this shall turn out for me to salvation". He was put in prison, and his career of service in a public way was brought to a close; but he was not a bit discouraged. "This", he says, "shall turn out for me to salvation". It was God's way with him.
I think that we all get some kind of prison. God works in us first, and then His way with us comes in to help. Nothing goes wrong; you may depend upon that. God always makes His way with us contribute to His work in us; and if God's way with us brings us into straits, it only brings us into a position where our wills are restrained from working, and this is salvation.
In reference to Paul it is with bated breath one would speak of such a distinguished servant of God; but it was the action of his will that landed him in prison; but when God allowed him to be fastened up in a place where his will and activity were checked, he says, 'It is all right; this shall turn to my salvation'. God's way with him was preserving him from the action of his own will; and, beloved friends, we shall find that it is so in our experience. A beloved servant
{411}
of the Lord, now with Him, used often to say that if Christians were wise they might discover where their wills had a tendency to work, for it was exactly at that point God would continually check and hinder them. If you find you are always checked and hindered at a certain point, you may depend upon it that it is a point where your will has a tendency to work. You would like to go in that direction, but God says, No! And why? Because He wants you to be saved. What does salvation mean? It means deliverance from all the power of evil; and I do not know anything more evil, or that I dread more, than my own will. Salvation in a practical and experimental sense is found in being set free from our own will, so that we do the will of God. A saved man is one who finds pleasure in the will of God, and does His will. If there was a man in this world who always kept the sentence of death upon his own will, and always did the will of God, God could point to that man and say, 'That is a saved man'. All checks and discipline of the pathway turn to our salvation in this way. We need not be frightened at God's ways with us; we need not be discouraged at all. It may be we are in prison. Perhaps you do not know what my prison is, nor I yours; but in the course of God's ways with us we have to pass through circumstances which check the action of our wills, and we cannot escape their effect. God brings these things in to check our wills, and thus to bring to pass our salvation. He thus delivers us practically from the action of that which really belongs to a lost creature.
Another thing comes in in connection with this, and that is *prayer*. Prayer means that there is a want in the soul, a demand for something from God, and it is consistent with God's way with us that He allows the demand to arise before He gives the supply. The supply is there before the demand arises, but God does not vouchsafe the supply until the demand arises. I suppose every Christian has known what it was to be in circumstances where there was a real
{412}
demand in his soul for succour from God. It is at such a moment that we realise the true meaning and value of prayer. It is all very well to *talk* of God's grace being sufficient for everything, but it is another thing to *realise* that we cannot get on without Him. It is *then* that we understand what prayer is. How beautiful is the apostle's language here! "Through your supplication". Not 'through my supplication', but "through your supplication". I think it is beautiful how he regards these Philippians as being in partnership with himself. In the early part of the chapter he thanks God for their "fellowship with the gospel, from the first day until now"; and when he says, "Through your supplication", it is as much as to say, 'I know you will pray for me, that Christ may be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death, and this is what I desire'. They were partakers of the same grace that was in Paul. He was at the front, the special target for the enemy's power, but the reserves at Philippi were supporting him with their prayers. Both he and they felt the need; there was the demand and the supply -- the "supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ".
Now see how this works out. The Man of God's good pleasure has been rejected from the earth and set in glory at God's right hand, and God works in His saints in this world, and by His gracious way with them He brings them to feel the absolute need of divine support, so that God's good pleasure may be worked out in them. They are in the line of God's good pleasure, and they feel the need of the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ in order to work it out. They pray, and then the supply comes. If we are to be here for God's good pleasure, it is not by making efforts and stirring ourselves up that it will come to pass. Confessing failure and resolving to do better for the future is not sufficient. Nothing will put us in the line of God's good pleasure but "the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ". We must have a fresh supply for the necessity of the day, or the hour, or the minute; and how infinite is the supply available
{413}
for us. Through that supply we get inward support. That is the first effect, as it was with the apostle in @2 Corinthians 12. He prayed three times that the Lord would take away the thorn. But the Lord said, "My grace suffices thee; for my power is perfected in weakness". He says first, "My grace suffices thee". By this I understand that the Lord would give Paul such a supply of His grace that Paul would be content to be reduced to nothing by the thorn; and then when Paul was so inwardly supported that he was content to be reduced to nothing, Christ's power would tabernacle over him, and accomplish infinite results through his weakness. Having this wonderful supply the apostle could say, I "will ... boast in my weaknesses, that the power of the Christ may dwell upon me".
Then there is support outwardly, as we get in the end of the chapter in Philippians. "And not frightened in anything by the opposers, which is to them a demonstration of destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God" (chapter 1: 28). The thought of salvation here, and in fact all through the epistle, is that we are for the good pleasure of God. Delivered from the working of our own will and from all that is evil in the world, we are for the good pleasure of God, and the power of God's salvation keeps us in the presence of our adversaries, We thus have the power of God, not only for inward support in our own spirits, but also for outward support, so that the adversaries around are not able to crush or dismay us, or turn us aside. The salvation of God is with us, and that is a very great thing.
God works in us so that we may appreciate what is according to His good pleasure; that is, that we may appreciate Christ; and then by His way with us He practically sets aside the activity of our own wills, so that through prayer we may receive the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and in the power and grace of this be here for His good pleasure. Then there is response to God according to chapter 2: 12, 13, "So that, my beloved, even as ye have
{414}
always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much rather in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you both the willing and the working according to his good pleasure". It is by God's work in us that we are found in harmony with His way with us, and the result is that we come out in the blessed character of Christ, and respond to God in love and lowliness and subjection and obedience. We are set in our mind and affections for the will of God. We work out our own salvation with fear and trembling. We refuse to be diverted from that which is pleasing to God. Nothing could divert Christ. Nothing could induce Him to take a single step for Himself; He was always controlled by the Father's will. We can only enter upon such a path in the spirit of fear and trembling, because we are conscious how liable we are to be diverted from it. We do not need to fear and tremble because of the difficulties and opposition around us, but because we are sensible of our own weakness. We fear and tremble because of what we are, and so long as we do so the mighty power of God's salvation will be with us.
In the path of God's will we realise that all that is of ourselves is a snare and a hindrance, and that obliges us to go on in fear and trembling and in constant dependence upon God. Because if we get out of the place of dependence we lose the secret of power, and fail to work out our own salvation.
Salvation will not be complete until we get our glorified bodies, and so we read that "our commonwealth has its existence in the heavens, from which also we await the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour, who shall transform our body of humiliation into conformity to his body of glory, according to the working of the power which he has even to subdue all things to himself" (chapter 3: 20, 21). That is the triumphant finish of the work of God in us; He will give us glorious bodies like the body of Christ. It is a great principle with God never to set up again a thing that sin has
{415}
touched. That which sin has touched is defiled for God and it must go. Sin has touched our bodies and made them a "body of humiliation", but when the Lord comes these bodies of humiliation will be changed in a moment, and we shall have instead a house out of heaven, a spiritual body, a body that never has been and never can be touched by sin, a body like unto the glorious body of the One who is at God's right hand. The power by which Christ will subdue all things unto Himself will bring it about. Christians have already come under that subduing power morally as to their minds and spirits, and when Christ comes, the body of humiliation, the body that has been touched and dominated by sin, will be replaced by a body of glory -- a body suited to new-creation scenes and heavenly associations and relationships.
May God enable us to see more clearly the nature of His work in us, and of His way with us, so that we may be more spiritually diligent in working out our own salvation, while we wait for complete salvation out of the scenes and circumstances and condition where sin has been!

THE CHRISTIAN'S DESIRES
@Philippians 1: 20, 23; @Philippians 2: 16; @Philippians 3: 7 - 12
I wish to bring before you a most interesting subject, namely, the desires of a Christian. A man's true character is indicated by his desires. To know a man's desires is to know the man; they are the true index to what he is. What a man is *outwardly* does not constitute his character: for this you must go beneath the surface to the hidden springs of the heart. In the word of God, man in the flesh is exposed right down to the very roots of his being. Not only is divine light thrown upon his actions and words, but the very desires of his heart are dragged out from their secret hiding-places and exhibited in their true and hideous nature, so that we know not only what man has done, but *what he is* -- we know his character.
In a similar way we have in the epistle to the Philippians the unfolding of the desires of a Christian's heart; and in connection with this I may remark that nothing is more wonderful than the way in which God developed the life and experience of a Christian in the beloved apostle Paul, so that the most exalted truths are not here stated in a doctrinal way, but are presented as having been worked out in the life and experience of a man subject to like passions as we are. In this epistle the heart of the man in Christ is uncovered, the very core of his moral being is laid bare, his inmost desires are exposed, and thus we learn here not so much what are the privileges, or the activities of the Christian, as we learn what constitutes the *character* of a Christian. May the Lord's blessing attend our meditations on this subject.
l. "According to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but in all boldness, as always, now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether by
{417}
life or by death" (@Philippians 1: 20).
Consider for a moment the peculiarly trying circumstances in which Paul was found when these words were penned. Think of him with all his natural energy of character, and with all the burning desires of a heart that had been saturated with the love of Christ, and that longed to carry the fulness of the blessing of Christ to every saint and sinner under heaven; and think what it must have been to *him* to be hemmed in by the four walls of a Roman prison. Such had been his position for at least two years, and yet he expresses no desire to have his circumstances altered. His one care and desire was that Christ might be magnified in his body in any circumstances -- whether by life or by death.
Did you never find yourself making your circumstances an excuse for your lack of devotedness to Christ? The poor man thinks, If I were rich I could magnify Christ a great deal; the weak one thinks, If I were strong and robust, what an amount of service I could render; the one who has not much gift thinks, If I could speak as well as So-and-so I could honour Christ much more than I do; others say, If I were in another family, If I had a different occupation, If my circumstances were changed a little, Christ might be magnified more largely in me.
Now the simple fact is that this is all self-occupation, and these are the wretched excuses made by the flesh to justify a lack of devotedness to Christ. Look at them, and you will find that they all centre round self. It is I this, and I that, I would be a wonderful Christian, and of course I should have the credit of it, and, in result, I would be magnified. The soul in this state has not really done with self -- that wretched old I -- and if circumstances permitted many works and much christian activity the result would be something like @Job 29.
If you read that chapter you will find the occurrence about fifty times of the words "I", "me", and "my". Job had
{418}
been in circumstances which favoured a great deal of benevolent activity, but you notice it all centred round himself, and you might justly entitle this chapter, Self Magnified.
An immense advance upon this may be found in a remarkable utterance of John the Baptist: "He must increase, but I must decrease" (@John 3: 30). Himself one of the last and greatest saints of a dispensation which recognised man in the flesh, John was taught of God to express what was not only true of himself personally, but true of him as the representative of man in the flesh. The very presence on earth of the second Man out of heaven was *morally* the setting aside of the old order of man in the flesh. Here was One who had come from above, from heaven, and contrasting this One with himself -- the Man of the new order with the man of the old -- John says, "He must increase, but I must decrease".
As the glories of the Person of Christ passed before the eyes of faith, He eclipsed everything that was of the first man.
Thus in @Job 29 we have self *magnified*; in @John 3 self *decreasing*; one more step and we find self *gone*. "I am crucified with Christ, and no longer live, I, but Christ lives in me; but in that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me" (@Galatians 2: 20). At the cross the One who knew no sin was made sin for us. It was, so to speak, as the Representative of the race of Adam that He died. The deep, dark waters of death flowed over and covered Him -- as once they flowed over the created earth -- and the end of all flesh came before God. That was the end of man in the flesh in the sight of God, and every believer in Jesus is entitled to take account of himself as having "died with Christ".
This is the starting-point of true christian experience. When first converted, I suppose we all, with more or less
{419}
earnestness, endeavoured to be what we felt we ought to be. We struggled and prayed, and resolved, and were grievously disappointed to find that we could not succeed in our purpose. We found that there was something within us which would not be brought into subjection to the will of God. We discovered that we had not only been guilty of doing many bad things, but that *we were bad ourselves*. It was not *sins* that troubled us at this stage of our experience, but *self*. At last we despaired of making ourselves better: we reached the point that another had reached hundreds of years before us, and could only cry, "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me out of this body of death?" (@Romans 7: 24). We became sensible that we needed as complete a deliverance from *self* as we did from *sins*. When we reached that point God showed us the blessed One who was lifted up upon the cross -- antitype of the brazen serpent -- and we were prepared to accept the precious fact of the gospel, that "our old man has been crucified with him", and that "we have died with Christ". By faith we appropriated the death of Christ and reckoned it as our own, at the same time discovering that Christ as the living, risen One was our life. Now the Holy Spirit, if ungrieved, would maintain us in the liberty of "life in Christ Jesus". As we walk in the Spirit we are kept in communion with God as to "our old man", and he never comes back before God -- he has been condemned and set aside for ever in the stupendous judicial work of the cross.
Then not only does Christ live in us, but He becomes the motive Object of our life as Christians. The law is no longer our motive or rule of life. It is entirely displaced by a Person, and that Person "the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me". Henceforth the soul has a new centre: it is no longer self-centred but Christ-centred. Christ is the motive Object, and not self.
The epistle to the Philippians starts on this level. If we do not know @Galatians 2: 20 in our souls we are not at
{420}
all prepared for Philippians. The "I's" and "me's" of Philippians (about ninety in number) are very different from the "I's" and "me's" of @Job 29 or @Romans 7. It is the Christian, as such, who speaks in this epistle, and the desires and experience spoken of are those of one who knows what it is to be "a man in Christ". With such a one it is no longer a question of circumstances, or of what may happen to him; but the desire that, whatever happens to him, Christ may be magnified, becomes the supreme concern of the heart. He counts that the "old man", who would have rivalled Christ, and who desired to magnify himself, has been reduced to nothingness at the cross; and now Christ is filling the whole horizon of his faith and love. He can look at the whole range of possible circumstances -- covering all by the words 'life or death' -- and his only desire is that Christ may be magnified in his body, whether it be by life or by death. The Christian, as such, has done with self as the source of his motives altogether.
2. "Having the desire for departure and being with Christ, for it is very much better" (@Philippians 1: 23).
I am afraid that in our desire to give prominence to the precious truth of the Lord's coming, we sometimes give the impression that it is a very inferior kind of thing to look for departing to be with Christ. It is therefore well that we should be reminded in this epistle of highest christian experience that Paul had a desire to depart. The Holy Spirit knew that in the actual history of the church, millions of believers would "fall asleep", and it was important that the attitude of the Christian in view of this possibility should have a place in this epistle. Otherwise it might be supposed, as was actually the case at Thessalonica, that to "fall asleep" was to sustain some loss, and that those alive at the time of the rapture would have some advantage over those who departed before. To be "with Christ" is "very much better" than to remain here. The sweetest thought in
{421}
connection with the rapture is that "thus we shall be always with the Lord" (@1 Thessalonians 4: 17). That is the heart's own portion, and it is a very precious fact that the infinitely blessed prospect of being in the Lord's company is connected with the departure of the Christian as well as with the coming of the Lord (see @Luke 23: 43; @2 Corinthians 5: 8; @Philippians 1: 23). The Christian's heart longs for the company of the glorious One "who has died for us, that whether we may be watching or sleep, we may live together with him" (@1 Thessalonians 5: 10). Therefore if we think of ourselves as part of the church we look for the coming of the Lord; if we think of ourselves as individuals we have "the desire for departure and being with Christ". Nor is this a small thing, for where this desire really exists it bears witness that the heart is not seeking its portion here -- it has done with the earth. The separating word has entered the soul, "Arise ye, and depart; for this is not the resting-place, because of defilement" (@Micah 2: 10). The mind is set on things above, not on things on earth. The links with heaven are stronger than the links with earth, and the soul's desire is *there*, not *here*.
I am afraid, beloved friends, that sometimes we look upon death as a melancholy termination of our course upon the earth. There is, I fear, but little of this leaping forward of the heart to be "with Christ". Paul does not speak of *resignation* or *submission*; he expresses a *desire* that burned with fervour in his soul. The earth was for him the poor polluted scene of man's sin and Satan's power, and he longed to be away from it "*with Christ*". The only thing that detained his heart here was the church. Christ's treasures -- the members of His body -- were here, and for their "progress and joy in faith" he was willing to remain. The Christian, as such, has no object upon this earth but the interests of Christ.
3. "To be a boast for me in Christ's day, that I have not run
{422}
in vain nor laboured in vain" (@Philippians 2: 16).
This third desire of Paul's heart looks on to the day of Christ, the day of manifestation and reward, and a solemn possibility is suggested that his joy in that day might be diminished if the saints at Philippi -- the results of his labour -- did not turn out to be bright, real witnesses for Christ.
I take it for granted that you are fully established in the grace of God. You know, through grace, that your sins are forgiven and that you are as clear of condemnation as Christ Himself. You have been saved by grace, and you now stand in grace, and you are assured that 'grace begun shall end in glory'. It is only when the heart is established with grace, that it is rightly prepared to be girded by the bands of christian responsibility. Do not be afraid of the word "responsibility". We *have* a responsibility as servants of the Lord Christ, of which we shall presently give account at His judgment-seat: and this is a truth which I believe is urgently needed to ballast our souls in these days of self-seeking and self-pleasing. It is a solemn and a sobering thought for us, as responsible servants of Christ, that there is a day coming when all our service will be weighed in the balances of the sanctuary; when all our ways, words, and actions will be manifested, and even the secret counsels of our hearts exposed in divine light.
I will bring before you two or three scriptures which connect themselves with this desire of Paul that he might rejoice "in Christ's day". (Read @2 John 8; @1 Corinthians 3: 13 - 15; @2 Corinthians 5: 10; @1 John 2: 28.) The solemn and heart searching possibility is suggested to us in these scriptures that we may "lose what we have wrought"; that we may "suffer loss"; that we may be "put to shame from before him at his coming"; and depend upon it, my brethren, these are not vain words. I pray God that their solemn force may not be lost upon us.
It is very sweet to see how all this is made to act upon
{423}
the affections of the saints. In two of the scriptures which we have read, it is brought forward as a reason why the saints should behave themselves properly, as it is also here in @Philippians 2. Thus the Holy Spirit enlists the affection of the saints for their spiritual fathers and leaders, as a motive to godly life and spiritual progress. The saints were, in a certain way, the workmanship of the servant, and if they turned out badly it would be his loss as well as theirs. It is as though the servant said to his converts, or to those for whom he was caring in the things of the Lord, 'You would, I am sure, like me to have full wages for my work, and to be able to give an account of it not only without shame, but with joy. If you turn out well, this will be the case, but if you turn out badly, I shall suffer loss'. Weavers know very well that if they turn out a damaged piece they do not get full wages; and if the servants of the Lord turn out bad work they cannot expect to get full wages. If the servant's work is of good quality it will be his glory, and joy, and crown of rejoicing in the day of Christ; but if his converts walk badly, and the lambs and sheep for whom he is caring do not thrive, he will certainly be a loser, and this is applied to the hearts and consciences of the saints as a reason why they should walk well.
We must remember in this connection that *all Christians* are the servants of Jesus Christ. It is in this character that Paul is writing in this epistle, see @Philippians 1: 1; he takes ground which was not only common to himself and Timothy, but also to all saints. Even to slaves it was said, "Ye serve the Lord Christ" (@Colossians 3: 24). Whatever be the nature of our service, it will pass under review at the judgment-seat of the Christ. May each of us think less of the opinions which men form concerning us in this day, and be more anxious to rejoice in the day of Christ that we have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain!
4. "But what things were gain to me these I counted, on
{424}
account of Christ, loss. But surely I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all, and count them to be filth, that I may gain Christ" (@Philippians 3: 7, 8).
Paul had counted all the religious "gain" of which he speaks in verses 5 and 6, "loss" for Christ, and still, after many years of deepening acquaintance with Christ, he counts "all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus". The great desire of his heart is, "that I may gain Christ", or, as it may be translated, 'that Christ may be my gain'. You understand such an expression in connection with earthly things; you know what James means when he speaks of buying and selling and getting gain. You know what it is to make things on earth your gain. In contrast to this, Paul was laying himself out that Christ might be his gain. He did not want gold, or silver, or religious reputation; he wanted Christ; and to gain Christ he gave up all things that would have made something of Paul. You may have found out that your *bad* things are a loss to you, but Paul had discovered that his *good* things were a loss to him. It was the things which elevated him morally and religiously as a man on the earth, that he counted loss. He had everything that could thus elevate him, when he was unconverted and without Christ. A man may have an immense amount of moral and religious "gain", and yet be nothing more than a natural man -- a man in the flesh. Christianity when taken up by the natural mind is a great elevation for man, and has become a great "gain" to many who do not know Christ at all. It is a solemn truth that all such "gain" is a great hindrance to gaining Christ. It is really building up the man who, as we have already seen, was set aside at the cross. Paul gave up everything that constituted his perfection as a religious man upon this earth, counting it all loss, that he might gain Christ. In short, he gave up one man that he might gain
{425}
Another; and this not only at some particular moment, but in such a way that this desire gave colour and character to his whole life. The Christian, as such, renounces the first man and everything that could be a gain to him, that he "may gain Christ".
5. "That I may be found in him, not having my righteousness, which would be on the principle of law, but that which is by faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God through faith" (@Philippians 3: 9).
Another great desire of Paul's heart was to be found in a righteousness that is wholly of God. What a glorious anticipation! He looked to be found in a righteousness to which the first man could not contribute a fraction. He rejoiced to escape from the possibility of any intrusion of his own righteousness. A man may be upright and amiable, and these natural qualities are often mistaken for the fruit of the Spirit. Some men are kind and conscientious who are not converted at all. None of these natural qualities go into the new creation, any more than the opposite qualities which are found in others. In the new creation "all things are of ... God" (@2 Corinthians 5: 18); everything that could be connected with man in the flesh is displaced, for that man himself is entirely set aside. Our whole condition in glory will be the display of a righteousness which is ours "by faith of Christ". Everything that is seen there will be of God -- it will be the display to wondering worlds of what we have been made *in Christ*.
And the Christian as such is looking with earnest desire to be thus found. He looks to be found completely apart from everything that could be attained by the first man, having only "the righteousness which is of God through faith".
6. "To know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death,
{426}
if any way I arrive at the resurrection from among the dead" (@Philippians 3: 10, 11 ).
The knowledge of Christ in glory was the supreme desire of Paul's heart, and this desire could never exist without producing an intense longing to reach Him in the place where He is. Hence the heart that longs after Him where He is turns instinctively to the path by which He reached that place in glory, and earnestly desires to reach Him in that place by the very path which He trod. The heart asks, how did He reach that glory? Was it not through resurrection? And did not sufferings and death necessarily precede resurrection? Then the heart says, 'Nothing would please me so well as to reach Him in resurrection glory by the very path which took Him there'. It is the martyr spirit; Paul wanted to tread as a martyr the pathway of suffering and death, that he might reach resurrection and glory by the same path as the blessed One who had won his heart. When Christ in glory is really known, the heart cannot only accept, but can earnestly desire to be found in the path which He trod down here -- the path which through suffering, death and resurrection leads to glory.
To read these burning desires of a Christ-absorbed heart is, if one may speak for others, most humbling to us, but they are the normal desires of the Christian as such. You may say that very few are up to this level. Alas! it is but true. We have grieved the Holy Spirit by our selfishness, our worldliness, our earthly-mindedness; Christ has not been paramount in our affections; our minds have not been set on things above; we have minded earthly things instead of practically having our citizenship in heaven; and the cross of Christ -- His place on earth of rejection, suffering, and death -- has not been coveted. Alas! many walk still of whom Paul could only speak with tears -- "enemies of the cross of Christ" (verse 18) -- those whose walk was of the very opposite character to suffering and death in this world. In contrast to all this, Paul could exhort the saints to be
{427}
"imitators all together of me, brethren, and fix your eyes on those walking thus as you have us for a model" (verse 17). He was a friend of the cross of Christ; he cherished and coveted a path which led to glory through suffering and death.
7. "I pursue, if also I may get possession of it, seeing that also I have been taken possession of by Christ Jesus" (@Philippians 3: 12).
Did you ever sit down in the presence of the Lord for half an hour to seek to apprehend the immeasurable glories for which Christ has taken you up? We have been "apprehended of Christ Jesus" (A.V.); He has taken hold of us, and He is going to bring us into -- what? The Christian, as such, desires to apprehend the full purpose of the love of which he is the subject. He longs to search the heights as well as the depths of that love. His heart rises into an infinitude of bliss and glory which cannot be expressed in human words. In another epistle Paul prays that the saints "may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height" (@Ephesians 3: 18) -- but he leaves the sentence unfinished. The whole immensity of the glory into which divine love will bring its subjects rises before his heart, but cannot be expressed. Christ Himself the centre of that glory -- the fountain of love that passeth knowledge -- and from that centre streams of light and glory filling the whole universe of God with bliss; while "in the assembly in Christ Jesus" God will have the full glory of His love throughout all generations of the age of ages. Christ has apprehended us for that, and Paul desires to apprehend it. The Christian's desire is to apprehend the unspeakable glories for which Christ has taken him up. They cannot be expressed in human words. When the apostle had been caught up into paradise he could find no words capable of unfolding what he heard there. Human words cannot be freighted with the bliss and glory
{428}
of that eternal future with Himself for which Christ has taken us up. May the Holy Spirit form in our hearts more intense desire to follow after and to apprehend these things.
In conclusion I repeat what I said at the beginning: a man's desires are the index to his character. I am sure that we cannot meditate on these desires without learning something of the character of a Christian, of the one who knows what it is to be "a man in Christ". I do not ask, 'Are you up to it?' but I do ask, are you not delighted to know that God is working in you to produce this character and these desires? How blessed, too, to know that He who has begun a good work in us will complete it unto Jesus Christ's day.

EPISTLE TO THE COLOSSIANS
{430}
{431}
NOTES OF A READING @COLOSSIANS 1: 9 - 24
C.A.C. The effect of the ministry of Christ is that faith in Christ Jesus and love to all the saints are brought about. Epaphras ministered Christ; he was "a faithful minister of Christ" (verse 7). God has shown us great favour in allowing us to be under the influence of a precious ministry of Christ; we hardly realise how great a favour it is. The effect is we become conscious there is one Man who can be trusted; there is one Man whom God has trusted.
If there is faith in Christ Jesus there will be with it love to all the saints: we become interested in the saints, for they are of and in Christ, they are of that order of man. Faith in Christ Jesus and love to all the saints are the starting-point in connection with assembly privilege: it is a good beginning. The foundation is a necessary part of the house, but it is not all the house. There was a condition in Colosse which was a good starting-point, but it was not the finish.
Ques. What is the full knowledge of His will? (verse 9).
C.A.C. It is the full scope of the pleasure of God in connection with the Head; it does not refer to the believer's individual pathway. We have to grow up in ability to act rightly in relation to the Head. If all saints were filled with the full knowledge of God's will, every one would have learned to act in relation to God's anointed Man; and in that way the body of Christ would come into evidence. Every one would be found doing what he ought to do and saying what he ought to say at the right moment, and doing and saying it in relation to a glorified Man in heaven. God would have us to understand His blessed will for us as connected with Christ. Everything that is for God's pleasure centres in Christ, so that if I want to understand the will of God, Christ must be the starting-point.
The importance of prayer is very great. When we find
{432}
the apostle praying, it indicates that the things he prays for can only be got by prayer; they cannot be imparted by ministry. Prayer brings in the divine acting, the working of God. It is blessed to have ministry that is of God, but there is something more needed, that is, divine operation in the souls of saints, and that stands connected with prayer. As the apostle prays here he goes on into an illimitable expanse of things till he has brought in Christ and the assembly, and the reconciliation of all things. In Paul we see a man who had wisdom and spiritual understanding. He was able to compass the immense thoughts of God in Christ, and all that Christ was to the body, and he could bring it before the saints in wisdom, and give the presentation of it that the saints needed at the moment. He had never seen those Colossian saints, but he could bring the unsearchable riches of the Christ to them in a suitable way as they needed it. We might desire a little of that wisdom and spiritual understanding; it can be got where Paul got it.
Rem. He was in prison.
C.A.C. Yes, the epistles that are so rich in the ministry of Christ came from prison -- Colossians, Ephesians and Philippians are prison epistles. I suppose it is often when things are most straitened outwardly that there is the greatest expansion spiritually.
Ques. Is ministry on the line of, "Give *ye* them to eat"
(@Luke 9: 13)?
C.A.C. There are three distinct features in the Lord's ministry, and they are characteristic of true ministry: they are healing, feeding and teaching. If people are suffering from maladies they cannot enjoy food, so spiritual healing comes first in Christ's ministry; that is negative, it is what corrects and heals all that is out of order. There are all sorts of moral diseases and infirmities amongst the saints, but spiritual ministry is corrective of all that. Then the Lord not only healed but fed. That is positive nourishing and
{433}
strengthening in the good of all that is blessed -- all that is of God and of Christ -- it is made available for us as food. We need building up spiritually in all that there is in divine Persons for us: there is a wondrous supply of food in the making known of what God is and of what Christ is. Lastly, the Lord taught them; He gave them the most wonderful and blessed unfoldings of the mind of God that were ever known. Spiritual teaching gives us intelligent access to the mind of God, to the great thoughts cherished in His mind; it puts us on confidential terms with God. God satisfies His heart; He says, 'I will put you on such terms with Me that I will tell you all I am thinking of and going to do'. Think of the blessed God communicating to us all His thoughts! The king would not do it, but God does it. These three features were demonstrated in all their blessedness in the Lord's ministry, and all true ministry is the result of an impression of Christ. If you are suffering from moral disease you cannot enjoy food, and if you are not nourished you do not understand what divine Persons are as available for food, and not man enough to take in the thoughts of God.
What we get here is on the line of teaching, entering into all that is for the pleasure of God so that we might be able to act in relation to it, to walk worthily of the Lord. He was the One of whom it was said, "The pleasure of Jehovah shall prosper in his hand" (@Isaiah 53: 10). God put all His pleasure, all that He delighted in, in the hands of the Lord to be carried out, and we are to walk worthily of the Lord unto all well-pleasing: it takes in everything pleasing to God. The apostle has in mind that every one of the saints should be put in his right place in relation to the Head, so that the pleasure of God might come out in the body in the way saints move together.
Ques. What would every good work be (verse 10)?
C.A.C. They are set forth in Christ. In Ephesians it says they are "before prepared that we should walk in them" (@Ephesians 2: 10). Everything that God can delight in in
{434}
man has been seen in the Lord Jesus, so we have not to launch out in a new path. It is new to us, but all the characteristics of that path have been set forth in Christ. He went about doing good. The test of whether a thing is a good work is, is it expressive of Christ? Is it the character of things that came out in Christ? If it is not, then it is not a good work. It was said of Mary, "She has wrought a good work as to me" (@Mark 14: 6). To come together to remember the Lord is a good work: He was the One to suggest it, so that makes it a good work. If our hearts learnt to connect everything with Christ, it would give us a good idea of spiritual things; if we cannot trace them to Christ they are not good works. It is a good work to read the Scriptures; the Lord was accustomed to reading them in public as well as in private. We are encouraged to believe we are doing a good work tonight in reading the Scriptures publicly together because the Lord did it. What makes a thing right and good is that Christ is the moving impulse of it; that is what gives it value before God. When He was here, everything He did was done in obedience and communion: it all moved from the Father. "The head of Christ is God" (@1 Corinthians 11: 3, Authorised Version). There was a Man here on earth who was always true to the fact that God was His Head; He never exercised divine power by an act of His own will but in relation to His Head. Now we have Christ for our Head: "The Christ is the head of every man, but woman's head is the man, and the Christ's head God". This epistle is full of the headship of Christ: everything good and right gets its impulse from Christ. I may do a thing with mixed motives, but the little bit of Christ's influence in it is what gives it value with God. There may be a mixture of vanity or desire to be thought well of in what we do, but if it is right at all, there is a streak of gold in it, and that is what gives it value. One might give vast sums of money to do good, and there might be no fruit for God because it did not spring from abiding in Christ. He is the Spring of
{435}
everything for God's pleasure, and fruitfulness is connected with abiding in Him.
Ques. How does "growing by the true knowledge of God" come about?
C.A.C. I suppose all edification is increase by the knowledge of God. There is no true growth apart from that. As we learn God we are formed in the divine nature. Peter puts it as through "the greatest and precious promises" etc. The promises express to me what God is: every promise is the setting forth of what God is for man. As I take hold of the exceeding great and precious promises I become partaker of the divine nature.
Ques. What is the full knowledge of God?
C.A.C. All that God is has come into view. God is in the light; there is no limitation on the side of revelation. If we are not formed in the divine nature we have not much capacity for sharing the portion of the saints in light.
The glory of young men is their strength. Colossians answers to John's young men. Paul and John divide the family of God in the same way. In John it is babes, young men and fathers. Paul has his three epistles. Romans would answer to babes, Colossians to young men, and Ephesians to John's fathers. Paul and John both regard the saints in three distinct stages of spiritual growth. If one is "strengthened with all power according to the might of his glory", one has got beyond the babe stage. "I have written to you, young men, because ye are strong" (@1 John 1: 14). One who has reached this point is more than a babe. It is not strength for action but for suffering: it is ability to endure and to suffer. It is wonderful to think of the power of His glory coming down to enable saints to endure and to suffer with joy.
{436}
NOTES OF A READING @COLOSSIANS 1: 10 - 29
C.A.C. It will help us if we keep definitely in view that the Spirit of God is engaging us here with the greatness of Christ; it is not our blessings, however great they may be, but the greatness of Christ. We have seen His greatness in connection with creation, and His greatness as Head of the body, the assembly, and His greatness in the fact that the fulness of the Godhead dwelt in Him, and now we come to His greatness as the One by whom reconciliation is effected. He is so great that by Him the Fulness can reconcile all things to Itself.
Ques. How do we understand all things reconciled to the Godhead?
C.A.C. The fact that reconciliation is needed, and has to be effected, suggests that something has come in which has caused a breach, like the wife who has separated from her husband in @1 Corinthians 7: 11. Something has come in that is offensive to the Godhead; it is not only that the creature is ruined. The Father, Son and Spirit are all included in the fulness of the Godhead, and something has come in offensive to each Person in the Godhead. A moral stain has come in which has disturbed the repose of the Godhead. It is a solemn thing. It is not only that the creature has fallen and is ruined, but the peace of the Godhead has been disturbed. Reconciliation comes in in order that all that might be removed, and the greatness of Christ comes out in the fact that He is the One by whom the fulness of the Godhead effects reconciliation. He is great enough to put all on a new footing with the Godhead. He has come into manhood in order to do so. The thing is done "by him". How pleasurable it must be to the Godhead. It is not only that the stain is removed, but it is removed by Him. Lawlessness has worked in heaven in Satan and his
{437}
angels. The very fact that such a dreadful thing has been in heaven has left a moral stain there. I wonder if we all understand what a moral stain is. Suppose a murder was committed in my house, would not a moral stain be left? Many persons would not live in a house where a murder has been committed; they would feel a moral stain there. Suppose such a thing happened, no creature could remove the stain left by a terrible crime, but God could remove it, and reconciliation is the removal of every moral stain, and Christ is great enough to do it. All the kings or great ones in the world together could not remove the moral stain of murder, but Christ could remove every moral stain from earth and heaven; that is reconciliation. He has died so that earth and heaven might come on to a new footing. It is now Christ -- His blood, His cross. The Lord's prayer, "Thy will be done as in heaven so upon the earth" (@Matthew 6: 10) could never have been answered if reconciliation had not been effected. It is the sacrificial basis on which all the pleasure of God rests in heaven and earth. Christ is great enough to secure a basis on which the repose and pleasure of the Godhead rest eternally in regard to heaven and earth. The fulness of the Godhead has accomplished reconciliation in the Son, in Christ. Satan and his angels will be cast out of heaven, the scene will be cleared so that not a bit of lawlessness will be left in heaven. God is going to clear the scene on earth too, and all on the ground that Christ has died. He is great enough to remove in sacrifice the moral stain before God; He can look down on the world and think of the death of Christ. This great and glorious Person has done it. It is His greatness and gloriousness that makes it so precious. The whole creation of which Adam was the head came under the effect of Adam's fall, so a moral stain was on the scene and the repose of the Godhead was disturbed. The Lord said, "My Father worketh hitherto and I work" (@John 5: 17). There was no repose for the Godhead. Reconciliation has been effected from the divine side,
{438}
the Fulness effects it. There is nothing whatever required on the side of the creature but faith. We have to have faith in what the Fulness has done -- that is the great gospel testimony. Paul had the place of being an ambassador for Christ and God, he had the ministry of reconciliation.
Everybody now can be called to reconciliation, for it has been effected by the fulness of the Godhead in the death of Christ. All men are invited now to come into it, they are besought to be reconciled to God. We joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the reconciliation. It is a wonderful thing to have received it. It is difficult to get hold of the idea, as we naturally think of it as something effected in us, but it is something effected by the fulness of the Godhead in Christ. It is always put that way in Scripture. A divine Person came into manhood, and in that divine Person was the fulness of the Godhead -- the Father and the Spirit were there as well as the Son -- and He came into manhood to effect reconciliation, and He could only do it by going down into death. In the early part of the chapter we are told that all dignities were created by and for Him; He created all dignities, and yet when it was a question of reconciliation He had to pass every place of dignity and go down to the cross. I think the cross is brought in here and in Ephesians to show that everything has been brought about through that which is most ignominious in men's eyes. The Fulness made peace by blood. It is peace secured by sacrifice, by death, but not a grand death -- a death of a character most revolting and degraded in men's eyes. "The blood of his cross" (verse 20). It has been done at the lowest place in which a man could be found on earth. There is no lower place than a cross. How it makes nothing of all that would puff a man up. But if everything for God's pleasure depended on a Man having His blood shed upon the cross it puts all on the footing of death. There is no puffing up then. The danger at Colosse was that some were "vainly puffed up by the mind of his
{439}
flesh" (chapter 2: 18), but the cross is man at the lowest point. I do not say that *we* have to come there to get blessing but we have to see that *Christ* came there. This will take the puffing up out of us.
"Having made by himself the purification of sins" (@Hebrews 1: 13) -- that means that He cleared sins away from before God, He removed them away from before the Godhead. We know whose sins were removed, but the point is they were removed from before the Godhead.
Ques. Is His making peace different from reconciliation?
C.A.C. It is bound up in reconciliation. Everything is taken away sacrificially. Through death, through blood-shedding, everything is taken away that could disturb the repose of the Godhead. It is not here a question of securing peace for sinners, it is not peace *with* God here, but the peace of the Godhead. In @Ephesians 2 it is peace between Jew and Gentile, "*he* is our peace" (verse 4). He has brought Jew and Gentile into peace, there is no enmity between them. What a blessed end of all discord between man and man. Another Man is brought in who displaces both, and becomes their peace. There were two men at daggers drawn, and the Jew says, 'I am nothing, I have been ended in the cross of Christ'. The Gentile says, 'I am nothing, I am removed in the death of Christ'. What remains? Only Christ! All the privileges of the Jew have gone, all the disabilities of the Gentile have gone in that death, and Christ is our peace; there is nothing left to make discord. Here in Colossians it is the peace of the Godhead. One loves to think of the Godhead as now in repose in regard to all the sin and lawlessness which came in in heaven and earth.
'The fulness was pleased to dwell in Him' is the correct translation -- it is what He was here on earth in flesh. In chapter 2: 9 the Fulness dwells bodily in a risen and glorified Man. We see the Father in Him and the Spirit in
{440}
Him too. It is wonderful to think that everything has been put on a new footing for God through Christ having come down here and died; and that has to be received by faith, it is not a matter of attainment or growing up to it. Anyone here is privileged to receive it tonight if they never have before.
The Spirit of God in verse 21 turns to the only company that has come into reconciliation. There is only one company which can be definitely said to be reconciled, and that is the assembly. You could not say any but believers were reconciled. It is like justification, which is in the mind of God for everybody, every man can be justified, it can be preached in the gospel that God is the Justifier, but no man is justified until he has faith. It can be said of all believers who have faith, "You ... hath he reconciled" (A.V.). We know what the state was in which we were found, "alienated and enemies in mind" -- our alienation from God manifested itself in a practical way in wicked works. Now the Fulness -- the Father, Son and Spirit -- has acted, and it can be said of every believer that he is reconciled. The Father, Son and Spirit have reconciled every believer, and it is in the body of His flesh through death. All that we were as in alienation has disappeared from God's view through Christ's death, but this is in view of the saints being presented "holy and unblamable and irreproachable" before the Fulness of the Godhead. What a wonderful thing to sit quiet and let into our souls that the Father, Son and Spirit through the death of Christ have so cleared away everything unsuited to Them that we can be presented to the Father, Son and Spirit "holy and unblamable and irreproachable" -- that is the gospel.
Now are we really on that footing with the Godhead? That is the footing which exists at the present moment. It witnesses the greatness of Christ. If we are not on that footing we are not giving Christ the glory that is due to Him. We are not honouring the Fulness.
{441}
Ques. What is the difference between justification and reconciliation?
C.A.C. Justification is that I am cleared from every charge. In Christ we are justified from all things, "Who shall bring an accusation against God's elect? It is God who justifies" (@Romans 8: 33). Every charge has been met. Justification is that you are justified from all things, justified from sins and offences; it is negative. But reconciliation is for something; we are reconciled to be presented "holy and unblamable and irreproachable" before the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. How it sets our hearts free! We can be presented to the Fulness of the Godhead in a faultless condition, through what has been effected by divine Persons.
Ques. Is reconciliation like @Luke 15?
C.A.C. We get in @Luke 15 what goes beyond it. The prodigal was covered with kisses. What we get here is more on the line of moral suitability to the Godhead, being presented "holy and unblamable and irreproachable". That is not so far as being covered with kisses. The prodigal is brought into the embrace of love, into sonship. Reconciliation is the basis on which the whole pleasure of the Godhead can be carried out, it is the basis of all the blessings in @Luke 15, but we do not get it presented further in this scripture than being blameless, etc., before the Godhead.
If you talk to people you find they are occupied with their failures, inconsistencies, defects, etc., which shows they are not in the faith of reconciliation. It is just there the "if" comes in; we are so soon moved away: "If indeed ye abide in the faith founded and firm, and not moved away from the hope of the glad tidings, which ye have heard, which have been proclaimed in the whole creation which is under heaven, of which I Paul became minister". The fact is that, practically, many of us do not abide in the faith, and we get moved away from the hope of the glad tidings. The
{442}
hope of the glad tidings is that I am going to be like Christ. I often think that if one's first thought on waking was, I am going to be like Christ, what a start for the day it would be. It is not merely I would like to be like Christ, but I am going to be like Christ for the pleasure of God. If one had the light of that, one would be very careful about allowing what is of the flesh. All this was brought in to take the Colossians away from any allowance of the flesh. If we have received the reconciliation, a divine Person is before us, another Man; and we are going to be like Him, on the same footing as He is before God.
In this epistle God is leading the saints on to the ground of being risen with Christ, but before we come to that ground we have to see what the fulness of the Godhead has effected, and to get our vision filled with Christ. The faith of the gospel occupies us entirely with Christ; not some of Christ and some of self but altogether Christ. We are not to be moved away from the hope of the glad tidings.
Ques. What is abiding in the faith (verse 23)?
C.A.C. The faith here is the faith of this wonderful Person, and of the reconciliation which the Fulness has effected by Him. We are not to be moved away from the faith of that.
Ques. Why does it say, "which have been proclaimed in the whole creation"?
C.A.C. That gives the scope of it: it is not limited to saints, but is for the whole creation. Anybody can come into reconciliation, can have the faith of Christ now.
What we get here is the light of what is above the sun, of what is in heaven and of the wonderful Person who is now in heaven. "Seek the things which are above, where the Christ is, sitting ..." (chapter 3: 1). All is connected with things above the sun, but known in the hearts of believers in this world. It is marvellous what God has brought about; but this is the gospel. It is especially Paul's gospel.
From verse 24 to the end Paul passes on to the assembly,
{443}
"of which I became minister". He was not only minister of the gospel but minister of the assembly. He brought out the full truth of the gospel and of the assembly; he was minister of both. Christ has suffered for the assembly, and Paul continued on that line. The sufferings for the assembly did not end with Christ, they were continued in the apostle Paul; he was allowed the privilege in a special way of suffering for the assembly, and he says, "I rejoice in sufferings for you, and I fill up that which is behind of the tribulations of Christ in my flesh, for his body, which is the assembly". Paul was ready to suffer anything so that Christ might secure a place in the hearts of the Gentiles; that is what he suffered for. If he had been content to confine Christ to the Jews he would not have been persecuted. It was because he was carrying Christ to the Gentiles that they persecuted him; his sufferings were in a peculiar way for the gentile assembly, and he was prepared to suffer so that Christ might have a place in their hearts. The character of the mystery here is "Christ in you the hope of glory". It is Christ in the hearts of the saints, Christ in their affections. It is not Christ formed in us but Christ in the affections.
Ques. Does not every servant suffer for the assembly?
C.A.C. No doubt there is a measure of suffering connected with all true service to the assembly, but no one else was privileged to suffer for the assembly as Paul did. He had the ministry of the assembly and had to suffer in a peculiar way for it akin to the sufferings of Christ. There was a character of suffering for the church left behind, and Paul took it up and filled it up; and being filled up in Paul there is none left.
The thought of the body is a living organism, every part of which is appreciative of Christ. Christ is in the affections of every one who is a member of His body; that is the special form of the mystery here -- a vast gentile company and Christ in the affections of each one in it.
{444}
Ques. Is it the same as "Ye in me, and I in you" (@John 14: 20).
C.A.C. That is the special activity of the Spirit to make us know that Christ is in the affections of the Father, the church in the affections of Christ, and Christ in the affections of the saints. It is a beautiful threefold cord; we are bound up in affection with divine Persons. The mystery here is that the Christ who is hidden in heaven is hidden in the affections of millions in this world, and Gentiles too. The church treasures Christ in her affections, every one in the body has Christ in the heart. Is Christ in your heart? If He is, you are in the body. Queen Mary was greatly taken up with Calais, and she said that after her death they would find Calais written on her heart. If we could get to the heart of anyone belonging to the body we should find Christ there. The body is a living organism, and Christ is in the affections of every one who is part of it; that is the mystery. Paul laboured, and his ministry was all to that end, that Christ should be in the affections of His saints. All ministry in the power of the Spirit is to that end.
{445}
THE CIRCLE OF DIVINE LOVE
@Colossians 1: 12 - 14; @Hebrews 2: 9 - 12; @John 14: 16 - 20
It is a deep joy to our hearts, beloved brethren, that a circle of divine love has been thrown open to us and in spirit we are brought into the circle of those affections. The assembly is really the circle of divine affections. How are we made competent to enjoy those divine affections? They have been perfectly revealed and secured to us. It is a great thing for us to be spiritually competent to enjoy divine affections. I feel myself much more familiar with *grace* than with *love*. Many of us do not rise above the thought of grace, blessed as it is -- we could not do without it -- but there are divine affections which flow out of their own fulness, out of their own blessedness. What a blessed thing to be the object of those affections!
In @Colossians 1, "Giving thanks unto the Father, who hath made us fit". I suppose we all know that this word "fit" is 'competent' -- 'the Father, who has made us competent'. And then in the next verse we get the translation into "the kingdom of the Son of his love". It is where love reigns. Beloved brethren, I cannot conceive anything more blessed than to be made competent in the divine nature to be associated with His Son in the enjoyment of the Father's love. There is no competency in connection with the flesh. What a joy to know that the Father has made us competent!
In @Hebrews 2 you find that the Sanctifier and the sanctified are "all of one". There is a company of whom Christ is not ashamed; that is, Christ can look upon that company and see them suitable to His own thoughts of love, and suitable to the Father's name, so that He can declare it unto them. We are made competent for it by being sanctified, by being set free from everything that is
{446}
unsuited to divine love by the death of Christ. And the effect of this is, He sings praises in the assembly.
In @John 14 we get the third element, and that is the "Comforter", "the Spirit of truth". The Father has made us fit by forming us in the divine nature; the Son has made us fit by sanctifying us; and now we get the Comforter. We are brought by the Spirit into that circle where divine affections are found: "In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you". It is an immense thing, whether we think of the Father, the Son or the Holy Spirit, that divine Persons are all engaged in making us competent to enter into and to respond to those divine affections of which we are the object -- engaged in bringing our hearts into the circle of love where the Father's name is known, where the affections of the Father rest, in Christ. It is not that we are in this outwardly, but it is in spirit.
In @John 13 we get examples of there being no love in the flesh; there was Judas -- no love there -- and Peter failed because there was no love in the flesh.
We know so little of what it is to enter into divine love; we get as far as grace -- and that is very precious, we cannot do without it -- but we want to enter into the circle of love. I feel for myself how little I do.
{447}
RECONCILIATION
@Colossians 1: 14 - 22
Rem. It has been pressed on me lately how little we have entered into the necessity for reconciliation. We should take into account what the entrance of sin into the scene meant for God. But He took a divine way to meet it that His heart might be liberated to flow out in love in the accomplishment of His purpose. God might have met the sin question by the judgment it deserved, and swept man off the scene. He would have acted in righteous judgment in doing that, but it would not have met the situation for God, because it would have left on record that Satan had thwarted God, and had spoilt effectually all that God had brought in for His pleasure. God could never have tolerated that.
C.A.C. The thought of reconciliation is connected with the revelation of God. It is striking that we do not get the actual word reconciliation in the Old Testament nor the word atonement in the New Testament. The word atonement means a covering; the first occurrence of the word translated "atonement" is in Genesis in connection With Noah covering the ark with pitch.
Ques. What is the difference between atonement and reconciliation?
C.A.C. Atonement is always for the one who has sinned, or for that which has been rendered unclean by the uncleanness of God's people, but reconciliation is what God has effected in view of His own pleasure. If God comes out to reveal Himself, the fulness of the Godhead comes into view: we get the Father, Son and Spirit. The revelation of the Godhead was by the Son becoming Man. God had in mind not simply that sin should be covered, but that a basis should be laid on which His own pleasure might be carried into effect in relation to persons and things which had come under the moral stain of sin. The coming
{448}
in of Christ, and His taking up the question of sin, and going into death for it, has secured this.
Ques. Is there any connection between that thought and the blood of the sin-offering being carried into the holiest?
C.A.C. I think the nearest thought to reconciliation in the Old Testament is in @Leviticus 16. Because not only did the blood go in, but the cloud of incense. The priest went in with the fragrance of the perfections of Christ. Everything that God does now is on the footing of Christ and His death: it would liberate the heart of the saints wonderfully to see this. These are elementary truths, but they are the greatest truths.
Rem. The hymn says,
<blockquote>'His hand, His house, His heart are free, <br>Because Thy work is done'. (`431:4)</blockquote>
C.A.C. Yes, exactly, the work of reconciliation has been done. It was actually done by the Son, by Christ, but the fulness of the Godhead was concerned in it. The fulness was pleased to dwell in Him in order by Him to effect reconciliation. The Godhead has acted to place us now on an entirely new footing. We are sitting now in the holy presence of God on an entirely new footing. We were alienated and enemies in mind, but the Fulness has placed us before Itself on the footing of Christ and of His death. To enter into that is of importance for the abiding happiness of our souls. Reconciliation is positively effected: it is not something that might be or ought to be, it has been effected by the fulness of the Godhead.
Ques. Is the world in reconciliation?
C.A.C. It is in the sense that neither Jew nor Gentile is in God's account now. Everything in God's account is dependent on Christ and His death; that is the footing on which everything stands before God at this present moment. As to the world it is provisional.
{449}
It is most important for us to understand the necessity for reconciliation. A condition of alienation and enmity has come into God's creation, and the fact that such a condition has come in has disturbed the repose of the Godhead. Not only is the creature ruined and lost, and we have bad consciences and lost peace, but the coming in of sin has disturbed the repose of the Godhead. The first necessity is that peace should be made for the Godhead. The Fulness in the Person of Christ has made peace by the blood of His cross, and now there is repose for the Godhead. Peace has been brought in for the Godhead in relation to all that disturbed, so that the Godhead can regard the creature on an entirely new footing; and by faith we can occupy that footing. But there is an important "if": "If indeed ye abide in the faith". Faith here is the faith of reconciliation. "And you, who once were alienated and enemies in mind by wicked works, yet now has it reconciled in the body of his flesh through death". The only persons reconciled are those who have the faith of it.
Ques. What is the difference between peace with God and for God?
C.A.C. Peace with God is connected with justification, but "having made peace by the blood of his cross" is assuring peace for the Godhead in view of the disturbing element that had come in.
Ques. What is the thought of @2 Corinthians 5: 19, "God ... reconciling the world to himself"?
C.A.C. "God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their offences". He was making known that everything now was on the footing of Christ. Everything presented in Christ has its basis in His death. The presentation of divine grace to men in Christ was all based on the work of the cross, though the work was not yet accomplished. We must remember that in divine purpose the Lamb was "foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but who has been manifested at the
{450}
end of times" (@1 Peter 1: 20). All the actings of grace and mercy in the Old Testament, and the work of God in effecting new birth in millions of souls throughout the ages, had as its basis the death of the Lord Jesus. His death was before God when He clothed Adam and his wife with coats of skin, and it was before God when He accepted Abel's sacrifice, "the firstlings of his flock, and of their fat". Indeed, in the whole sacrificial system from beginning to end, God was saying, 'I have Christ before Me, and I want Him to be before you, I want you to come to Me with the memorial of Him and of His death, and then I will be pleased with you'. If we want to minister pleasure to God, and I hope there is not one here who would not like to, we must come near to God on the footing of Christ and His death. His saints in the faith of Him thus become an abiding memorial of Him in the presence of the blessed God.
Rem. Enoch walked with God and brought pleasure to Him.
C.A.C. Yes, that is the kind of man who will be translated -- reconciled persons; those who are presented holy, unblamable, irreproachable are the kind of persons ready for translation. Translation did not mean much change morally for Enoch: it is a pity if translation would mean a great change morally. If we are in the good of reconciliation we are on a footing with God which we should be found in absolutely if translated. J.B.S. said to me not long before he died, 'I shall be very happy in the Lord some day, and suddenly find myself with Him' -- there is no great change in that. Enoch walked with God and had the confidence of God; God told him wonderful things, so that he had in spirit the good of reconciliation and eternal life; he was outside the domain of death, and he had faith to be translated. The wonderful thing is that he had the faith of it before the actuality. It says, "By faith Enoch was translated".
Ques. Is it an exhortation in @2 Corinthians 5, that they
{451}
should come into the good of reconciliation?
C.A.C. The apostle's ministry had been called in question at Corinth, and he insists on the character of his ministry. Indeed, it is pretty evident that at Corinth they were not in the good of the new covenant or reconciliation. Yet he addresses them as reconciled, "All things are of the God who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ". "Be reconciled to God" is the character of his ministry.
Reconciliation is a sacrificial idea; it is effected in the death of Christ, "in the body of his flesh through death" (verse 22). "Being enemies, we have been reconciled to God through the death of his Son" (@Romans 5: 10). It is something effected by the death of Christ. God intends to magnify Christ in our hearts, and to magnify the work and death of Christ, to make it very great to our thoughts. If Christ and His death are in our thoughts we become pleasurable to God. Reconciliation brings in an entirely new standard of walk and soul condition.
I think the body in @Colossians 1 is not exactly the assembly for the expression of Christ, but for the cherishing of Christ. You must have Christ cherished before you have Him expressed. In chapter 3 you have Christ expressed; the features and grace of Christ coming out in the body for the pleasure of God. But in chapter 1 the body is that vital organism where Christ is cherished, a company of persons who value Christ. The working of God in chapter 1 is in the vessel of ministry: "I toil, combating according to his working, which works in me in power" (verse 29). The mighty power of God was working in Paul as the vessel of ministry so that Christ may be ministered. Through the ministry Christ gets His place in the hearts of the saints, and there is a living vessel here capable of cherishing Christ, and that vessel is the body. Paul was the minister, and we have to come into the good of what Paul ministered. It is too great a thing for us to be minister of. God took up a man and made him the vessel of the ministry of Christ, so that Christ
{452}
might be enshrined in the affections of a gentile company, and that company is still in this world. The christian company eating the Supper brings the body into view in its vital affections: the body is the one sphere of delight for God in this world. A company of persons with living affections cherishing Christ and His death, and consciously on the footing of Christ and His death with God. That is the good of reconciliation.
Reconciliation has been effected in one body; not Jews and Gentiles reconciled and remaining Jews and Gentiles, but both reconciled in one body to God by the cross. Jews and Gentiles were the greatest antagonists, they could not be brought together by any human power. But when reconciled, a Jew would say, 'I am gone and Christ remains'; and a Gentile would say, 'I am gone and Christ remains'. Now there is nothing between them. The new man is the moral material out of which the body is constructed.
Ques. Would you tell us about the new covenant in reference to reconciliation?
C.A.C. The death of Christ is looked at in the new covenant as giving expression to the outflowing of the heart of God; everything in the way of blessing is the product of divine love and can flow out from the heart of God towards man through the death of Christ. The ministry of the new covenant is the ministry of what flows out from God to man. Reconciliation is that God puts everything on a new footing for His pleasure. We are on a footing where everything is delightful to God and there is perfect repose. The woman in @Luke 7 is an example of one who apprehended Christ as the covenant. How she was affected by it! She pours herself out on Him; her tears, the wiping of His feet, the anointing, show the effect of the covenant. Forgiving love had charmed and won her heart. "Go in peace", or into peace, is perhaps an intimation of reconciliation; it is an intimation that there is a place to
{453}
travel into where there is the sense of being under divine complacency. This is a great liberation for the heart; it sets one free. When we know the reconciliation which God has effected, we can take our place with Him on that ground. But there is a danger of being moved away from it. Our enjoyment of reconciliation depends on our abiding in the faith of it. Those who abide in the faith of reconciliation are not moved away from the hope of the gospel and they give God pleasure.
The hope of the gospel is that we are going to be like Christ. The fulness of the Godhead has reconciled us; the Father the Son and the Spirit. "By him to reconcile all things to itself", but it is the Fulness that does it. It gives one an immense thought of the greatness of Christ. If we leave this room today with an enlarged sense of the greatness of Christ, and of His cross, it will help to deliver us from what is all around us -- the pride and pretensions of man. The fulness of the Godhead came in to reconcile, but the work was done at the lowest point, at the most ignominious place, at the cross. It emphasises the terrible nature of what had to be removed. A glorious death would not have been suitable: it was fitting it should be the death of the cross. The sinful state was so abominable, so hateful in the sight of God that it had to be removed in the most ignominious death possible; but the One who went into that death was the infinitely great and glorious Person of whom @Colossians 1 speaks. When we get a sense of that, it makes nothing of our pride and vanity, and the things which belong to us naturally: these are the very things which, if we allow them, hinder our being in the good of reconciliation.
Ques. What is the difference between what God has effected now, and what will exist when all evil is done away?
C.A.C. Simply, that then it will be actuality. God's pleasure will be found in actualities, but now His pleasure
{454}
is found in saints being in the faith of it. The moral stain will eventually be removed from all things, all the things which have been affected by enmity.
In @Revelation 5 everything comes on to the footing of what the Lamb has done: it is a question of the worthiness of the Lamb, and all creation becomes vocal with His praise.
Ques. What is meant by thrones, lordships, principalities and authorities?
C.A.C. I thought they expressed the principle on which God has put the whole creation together. It has pleased God that His creation should take a form which is a striking witness against lawlessness. Thrones, lordships, principalities and authorities are creations of dignity and rule. God's creation is ordered on the principle of rule; it is an entirely contrary thought to insubordination and lawlessness. Every dignity has been created by Christ, and all will derive from Him. He is the Head of all principality and authority, and all must be eventually subservient to Him. They have been usurped or permitted to pass into men's hands in view of the divine government of the world, but all will revert to the Heir. Christ is the Heir of every dignity, all is going to revert to Him and will be held by Him on the ground of that reconciliation which has been effected in His death.
{455}
NOTES OF A READING @COLOSSIANS 1: 17 - 29
C.A.C. It is well to see that all brought out here of the greatness of Christ is really to lead us into the truth of how we stand in relation to Him. I suppose the whole point of this scripture is to bring out that this great and glorious and divine Person has that which stands in relation to Him as His body; and it is not presented abstractly as what is true in Him, but so that we can understand the immensity of the fact that He now has what is in relation to Him as His body.
It is in this connection that reconciliation is necessary according to Colossians, because we could not think of His having a body that was in any way unsuitable. He can take up nothing that is not reconciled. And what has been effected in reconciliation will yet be applied to all things; it extends to everything He has created, and yet there is something brought about now greater than the reconciliation of all things; that is, reconciliation of certain persons who are presented before the Fulness "holy and unblamable and irreproachable" (verse 22), in order that they can stand in relation to Him as His body. It is astounding! It is unique, because when the "all things" are reconciled, they will never be set in that intimate relationship of His body. So we need to be seriously concerned to enter into the greatness of it all.
To think that such a Person, that so majestic a Person, should be Head of the body! There is a certain company of which *He* is Head. Reconciliation is very important if you take into account what the Fulness has in mind in reconciling these persons to Itself.
"Fulness" is that which is adequate to bring out all that is in the Persons of the Godhead. So that creation and reconciliation, and the assembly as the body, will serve to bring out the fulness of the Godhead as moving in the
{456}
activities of love. The things are not yet reconciled but the persons are; that is, the saints are in the most blessed position conceivable as regards their being cleared of every moral stain. They can be presented before the presence of the Godhead "holy and unblamable and irreproachable".
No one could be in the body but as reconciled to the fulness of the Godhead. And it is the Fulness presenting to Itself. It is very blessed to see that it is for the pleasure of the Fulness. So that conditions are brought about to make it possible for saints to be in relation to Christ as Head, and no one who does not know what it is to be reconciled can possibly be of the body.
Rem. There are two ways (in Colossians and Ephesians) in which Christ is spoken of: as Head of the body and as Head to the body.
C.A.C. Well, He is Head over all to the body; there is His universal headship, but then the assembly is brought to share it with Him because she is brought into the place of His wife. There is what He is as Head of the body, and that brings out the character of the body. The Spirit of God is seeking to make us realise what it is! It is that company that stands in vital relation to Christ as its Head. The Spirit of God would bring us to realise our relation to Christ as the body -- His body -- and for that the apostle laboured with all his might, to bring the saints into the consciousness and reality of the body.
Rem. He enlarges on the greatness of the One to whom the assembly is united.
C.A.C. What an effect it would produce if our hearts were a little touched by it. We should all go away from this meeting changed people.
Ques. When will it be seen?
C.A.C. It is not seen now, and is not that why he mentions hope in this epistle? "On account of the hope which is laid up for you" (verse 5), and "not moved away from the hope" (verse 23). The consummation of it is a matter of
{457}
hope.
The first light of the gospel is that we are justified and reconciled so that we may be conformed to the image of God's Son. That is the light we get at the beginning of our spiritual history. Paul says here, "not moved away from the hope of the glad tidings, which ye have heard, which have been proclaimed in the whole creation which is under heaven". That is, there is one gospel everywhere. The Colossians were in danger of being moved away; that was because hope was not maintained in their hearts. At the beginning light did dawn -- the light of being conformed to God's Son, a glorified Man in heaven. And if we lose that, we lose the sense of being the body of Christ, and that is why so few saints have any idea of the body of Christ. No one has the hope of glory until Christ is livingly in their affections.
Now in the body viewed as in relation to Christ there is nothing inconsistent with Christ any more than there will be in heaven. If it is Christ's body, Christ will come out in it. By and by it will be Christ; and I must not excuse anything else. If anything else does come out, I ought to bury my face in the dust.
If we are affected by the truth, it is that we should not be moved away from what God has before Him in the future -- that we should be conformed to His Son -- but also not moved away from what is now before Him in the body of Christ, so that the manifold graces of Christ should come out in it now. That is the character of the mystery. "The riches of the glory of this mystery" (verse 27) have come out in the ministry of Paul; he was the minister and suffered for it. If any of us are minded to follow Paul we shall suffer too. Paul was exclusively the minister of the mystery; that is, he brought the ministry directly from God, and we are sitting under it tonight, just as the Colossians were then. If we want to know what the ministry of the gospel is, and what the ministry of the assembly is, we must go to Paul for it.
{458}
He suffered from the religious man all his life, and it is the religious man still who will not have the truth of the body. That we should come into evidence as the body of Christ is the most wonderful thing ever heard of in Scripture -- or out of Scripture.
Ques. Will the Jews be brought into reconciliation?
C.A.C. Yes, I think Israel will be reconciled. Jehovah will become their righteousness, and they will be reconciled. The time is coming when He will say, "This people have I formed for myself: they shall shew forth my praise" (@Isaiah 43: 21). Well, that must be a reconciled people.
The body is now made known through ministry. It is not enough that Christ should die, and be raised, and be glorified and the Spirit given -- all that put together would not put the saints into the body. Therefore Paul's great service as the "minister" is essential.
Rem. And intelligence is needed.
C.A.C. God knows how far we have got, and He wants us to understand the nature of the body, and that it is essential that every bit of the body should be of persons made perfect; that is, brought into such a state that nothing could possibly be added to them.
Rem. The Lord said to Saul, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" (@Acts 26: 14).
C.A.C. That is the point, they were His body, Christ was coming out in them. Paul was persecuting them because they were really His body.
The ministry helps us into divine thoughts that would never enter the creature mind; and Paul is ministering them to us tonight. This mystery was "hidden from ages and from generations, but has now been made manifest to his saints; to whom God would make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you the hope of glory" (verses 26, 27). No one can have the hope of glory until Christ is in them, and that is the character of the mystery. God is bringing it about
{459}
that Christ is really and spiritually in people who were once poor and alienated Gentiles; and Paul is labouring that this shall be worked out in result. You could not think of Christ being in a person and there being nothing to indicate it. J.N.D. said, 'If you are in Christ, Christ is in you, and if Christ is in you, take care that nothing but Christ comes out of you'. As Christ is livingly in me I correspond with the glory, and I can look for it happily and joyfully.
So the apostle is labouring according to God's working, "admonishing every man, and teaching every man, in all wisdom, to the end that we may present every man perfect in Christ" (verse 28). That is what he is after; nothing short of that will do. It is only those "perfect in Christ" that can be in the body in any vital sense. It is the Gentiles, it is a collective thought, and it is the body because Christ is there. It would not be the body if Christ were not there, because it is His body. It comes out individually, Paul is dealing with individuals. And that is the object of all labouring and all ministry now, that every man should know what it is to be complete in Christ. "Every man", it is those who come in range of Paul's ministry. God's thought for every one of us is that each of us should be perfect in Christ. I can well understand that if we realise who Christ is and what Christ is, if we are blessed in that Man, and furnished in Him, and if everything God has given us is in that Man, such a man does not need anything from any other quarter; he is perfect in Christ. And that is what it means. It is not a question of attainment, but of obtaining it through the precious ministry of Paul; and none of us can obtain it anywhere else. Then the warning is that something crafty of the devil may come along and divert us from this.
Rem. "Whom *we* announce", it says in verse 28.
C.A.C. It is what is announced in Paul's ministry, and God was working this truth mightily in Paul's soul, so that he could not help bringing it to bear on anyone he met. It would be good if it were so with us. It shows how difficult
{460}
it is to get these divine thoughts into the minds of people. It was difficult for Paul and it is just as difficult today. We see the impossibility of getting this thought of the body into the mind of any believer except by divine working and Paul's ministry going together.
Rem. We have to be attracted by the thought of it.
C.A.C. To begin with there are the glories of Christ, that is true leverage. He is the Creator, all things subsist together by Him, and reconciliation is by Him, and we are called to be the body of that glorious Man in heaven. We are His body to *express* Him. Anyone not expressing Christ could not be said to be in His body. It could hardly be said of those who minded their own things and not the things of Christ.
It is additional to what they had at Pentecost. Pentecost was not the climax of everything. Not one of them there knew anything at all about the body. Think of a poor old man in prison with scarcely enough food to eat, and yet the most mighty work of God on the earth was in that poor old man! And he was labouring in that day for what many Christians of that day knew nothing of. All that is for revelation is out now. The mystery is the last thing to complete the word of God, so we might say God has told out all His mind. Now, are we affected by it?
{461}
NOTES OF A READING @COLOSSIANS 2: 1 - 15
Rem. The word "combat" (verse 1) would imply the very deep conflict the apostle went through for the Colossians.
C.A.C. And ourselves. It serves to show that the apostle was very conscious of the difficulties and the opposition. If we think of the greatness of Christ and the place that He is to fill for God, we must see that all the devices of the enemy will be brought into action to hinder the saints from apprehending it. So this chapter takes the character of warning. The first chapter is the positive ministry of Christ; and chapter 2 is mainly occupied with warning against influences that steal our hearts away from Christ; and the remainder of the epistle would show how this precious truth would work out in a practical way in the saints. I suppose we see it more in the third chapter than in any other part of Scripture.
Rem. It is the features of Christ coming out in the body really.
C.A.C. Yes, indeed; and there are certain conditions stated as necessary on the part of the saints if we are to be spiritually intelligent. "That their hearts may be encouraged, being united together in love" (verse 2). I suppose we shall hardly get the full assurance of understanding apart from these conditions. They are such as the knowledge of God would bring about. The knowledge of God in love would give us encouraged hearts. It is when people are discouraged and disappointed that room is made for Satan's efforts. "United together in love" is a love to one another because it is a knitting together. This "combat" is an agony of heart which the apostle had before God, like the agony of Epaphras in the last chapter. He was agonising in prayer with God (not exactly meeting the enemy), which is a very important service, especially if we see anything
{462}
moving among the saints to take away their hearts from the sense of the greatness of Christ; and the whole cause of God would suffer, if saints were turned aside. So that with encouraged hearts and knit together in love, which is just the normal fruit of the gospel, we should be prepared to take in the wonderful thought of God as to the place Christ is to fill in the whole universe of bliss, for that is, I suppose, the thought of the mystery of God. It is the most comprehensive view of it that we get in Scripture, as I understand it.
Rem. @Revelation 10 speaks of the mystery of God -- His workings being completed.
C.A.C. Yes, I think that all that has been hidden in the ways of God will be brought to an issue. It will be seen that God has been working secretly all the time with a specific end in view. That is very comforting for us when we see these great upheavals amongst the nations. We need to remember that all the while, God is working to His own great end. The mystery of God would include the place that Christ will fill in the whole universe of bliss. The assembly is the nearest circle, but there are other circles. The One who created all things must of necessity possess them. He created them, they subsist together by Him, and He is going to exercise His headship in view of blessing. Every family will own Him, and God would have us entertain that in our hearts in great reality now, because if that is the place He will have then, surely He has a right to have it in my heart now. The wonderful thing is that the saints of God in Christ Jesus have a world of their own, and men around us have no idea of it at all. We have to cultivate dwelling on these invisible things, which are the greatest realities there are. I suppose the headship of Christ is the greatest thing of all. It is no mere imagination with us. The world is full of shams and shadows, but the Christian has the privilege of living in a world of reality. How it would fortify us against the dangers mentioned here.
{463}
It is the privilege of each to hold the Head and to find we can draw out of this wonderful Person satisfaction for ourselves and for our brethren. It would go very much with "out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water" (@John 7: 38).
Rem. It would go with "in which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge" (verse 3).
C.A.C. Yes, and it is very wonderful that God should present Himself to us as acting in wisdom and knowledge. We know Him as acting in love, and He would like us to know Him as acting in this way; that is, the blessed God knows what He is doing. It says in Ephesians, He has abounded "towards us in all wisdom and intelligence" (chapter 1: 8) -- that is on God's part, He knows what He is about. These great things are not stated absolutely; they are matters of prayer; we need to have them before us. It is clear that we cannot be pleasing to God unless we are intelligent. If He is acting in wisdom and knowledge, His saints (or sons) must know what it is to have intelligence, or they do not satisfy the Father's heart.
We do not get into everything at once, but as Christ and His glories are known in our hearts we have the key to everything that God has in mind for the universe. He says, 'I am going to make that blessed anointed Man Head of everything, and that is not only Head of the assembly, it is universal headship. There is not going to be a single thing in the vast universe of bliss that does not take character from Him'. Will it not be good to be there! God desires us to have these things as objects of pursuit, even if we do not get far into them. We are to go after them; He is helping us all the time.
The apostle was able to recognise that the Colossians had really received the gospel from Epaphras. They were walking in assembly order and their faith in Christ was firm. Then we are to go on with what we have begun with: "As therefore ye have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord,
{464}
walk in him, rooted and built up in him" (verses 6, 7).
There are different dangers: "Philosophy and vain deceit, according to the teaching of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ" (verse 8). Then the Jewish element: we are not to be occupied with feasts and new moons (verse 16). Then human imagination, and then the man who worships angels, "vainly puffed up by the mind of his flesh" (verse 18); that is, he is dealing with imaginary things. All these things are present today. All that is losing sight of the headship of Christ. The test of these things is they are not according to Christ. I have sometimes seen a book in a shop window that I have thought I should like to read. Then I have asked myself, would it help me in the knowledge of Christ? It would not, and I have passed on. The philosophy of the world is exceedingly poor and small, whereas we have to do with One in whom the fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily, and we are filled full in Him.
Ques. Would you tell us what the fulness of the Godhead dwelling in Him bodily means?
C.A.C. Well, it means more than I can say.
Ques. It refers, would you say, to His present position, and includes His manhood?
C.A.C. Yes. It dwells in Him bodily, not merely spiritually. It dwells in the body of that glorious Man in heaven, and we can come into it; and nothing to be known of God is outside that Man. God has set forth all that He is in that glorified Man. There is nothing in creation to set forth all that He is, everything is there in Christ; if we want to know the Father we must learn it in Him.
Rem. The footnote (d, Darby Translation) reads, 'The fulness or completeness of the Godhead is in Christ, as towards us; and we, as towards God, are complete in him'.
C.A.C. It is one of the most extraordinary statements in Scripture because it is infinite.
Ques. Would you explain why the Godhead is brought in here?
{465}
C.A.C. To bring in all that belongs to God, all that is set forth in God the Father and the Son and the Spirit. You could not leave out one Person or it would not be the fulness of the Godhead. All that the creature can know of God is set forth in a glorified Man. "In him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily" (verse 9); and a soul not established in grace might say, that frightens me! Paul goes on to say, "And ye are complete in him"; and that takes us up in suitability to the fulness of the Godhead. You are 'filled full' in Christ; I do not want anything but Christ! We are not in liberty in the assembly unless it is so, not free to worship, which implies we know God and know that we are perfectly suitable to Him. How could I worship unless I knew I was suitable? Viewed as the body we have not anything outside Christ, we are filled full in Him, there is not a desire outside Him. If I am wanting a hundred and one things outside Christ I am not really in the body.
We enter into things now as seeing them in a risen and glorified Man. The interesting question was asked me the other day, why in the hymn book we never dwell on the perfections of Christ as Man here in detail. The spouse in the Song of Songs describes everything relating to her Beloved in detail, not in a general way. I believe it is because as in the assembly we view the Lord in another position and are not engaged with the greatness that came out in Him here as Man in flesh and blood, for we start with His death. The first thing before us when we come together for the Supper is His death as the ground on which we can participate in His life as risen and ascended and glorified. It is in that condition that we are all of one with Him; so that we do not dwell on the features that came out in Him down here. It would not be quite suitable to the occasion, because we know Him as risen and glorified.
Ques. What would you say as to the burnt-offering?
C.A.C. You could hardly have raised an illustration that better confirms what I am saying, because by contrast
{466}
in the meat-offering the sweet savour goes up to Jehovah, but it was food for the priest to eat. The perfections of Christ here are for our contemplation and we are to feed on Him, but is not that different from the service of the assembly? All His perfections are treasured in the hearts of His saints, but then we think of all His perfections that have come out in His death, and the saints begin there. `313:1 comes nearest to it, but even there they are looked at as going up to the Father as a sweet savour. The saints treasure them but we could have no link with Him on this side of death, but in resurrection. This chapter speaks of it, "Buried with him in baptism, in which ye have been also raised with him" (verse 12). It puts us on new ground. This is the whole truth of the matter. We begin with Christ disclosing all His perfections in death, we do not go back to His path here, we go on to dwell on the new position He takes up as risen and glorified. It is new ground. As we sing in `95:3,
<blockquote>'The glories of His work we bring, Thee glorified we see; <br>His deep perfections gladly sing, And tell them forth to Thee'. </blockquote>
{467}
NOTES OF A READING @COLOSSIANS 2: 8 - 15
C.A.C. The concern of Paul here was that the hearts of these Colossian saints, and ours, might be so furnished that we may be unmoved by delusions and persuasive speech and by those who would lead us away as a prey by philosophy and vain deceit. If we apprehend the greatness and fulness of Christ we should be preserved.
This scripture shows us that after having had a faithful ministry of Christ such as the Colossians had through Epaphras, and having received the Christ and being marked by faith in Christ Jesus, and walking in the beautiful order of 1 Corinthians -- assembly order -- yet they were in danger and needed further enrichment in the knowledge of Christ. They needed a further ministry of Christ beyond what Epaphras could give them. Epaphras seems to have told Paul, I have told them as much as I know, I see they are in danger, they need something more. So Paul writes this epistle to give them a deeper and fuller ministry of Christ than they had yet received. Paul was in an agony of exercise about us all, because we all come in amongst these who have not seen his face in flesh. His great concern was that there might be conditions with us, our hearts encouraged and united together in love, so that we might be able to apprehend "all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the full knowledge of the mystery of God; in which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge" (verses 2, 3). If we get hold of that, the enemy has nothing to offer that is tempting.
Ques. What is the mystery of God?
C.A.C. I suppose the mystery of God is God's great design to make everything centre in Christ. It would go out wider than the church, it would be that great design which is altogether veiled from the eyes of men, God's great
{468}
design to set everything of Himself forth in Christ and to make Christ the great Fountain head out of which the whole universe will be filled with delight for God -- that is the mystery of God. We are all acquainted with what is in view but God would bring us to what is behind the scenes and that is the greatness of Christ. If the greatness of Christ gets hold of our hearts, everything that is the product of man's mind is seen to be empty. The Colossians had lived vile lives. There was a time past when the apostle could say, 'You lived in certain things, vile things'. Now grace has come in and delivered them from vile things, but Satan was going to work subtly to capture them by things of the mind, elevated things, things that appeal to intellect and reason, and they were in danger. I suppose we are surrounded today by a world of intellect, and it all appeals to us. If we have any mind at all, the world of intellect appeals to us, and we need to be fortified against it by the sense of the greatness of Christ. Nothing will preserve us from the world of intellect but Christ; it is more subtle than the world of lust. There is a very large building in this country, a beautiful building; it carries a large inscription on one side which says, 'There is nothing great on earth but man'. If you go round the other side of the building you will see a corresponding inscription which says, 'There is nothing greater in man than mind'. That carries engraved in stone the convictions of men, and there is no room there for Christ. Of course all the philosophy and reasonings of men lead you nowhere; their wonderful investigations into the secrets of nature, their wonderful discoveries and theories, if you follow them up, as I once said to a scientific man, where do you get to? He said, 'We come up against a blank wall'. That is where philosophy, the teachings of men, the elements of the world and the mind of men land you, at a blank wall. Evolution too leads you to a blank wall, and God is behind the wall, and you cannot reach Him. What a contrast when Paul speaks of One in whom the fulness of
{469}
the Godhead dwells bodily! You cannot have a more striking contrast. On the one hand we get the intellect of men and their speculations and enquiries, reasonings and philosophy -- a blank wall; you see on the other side what God presents. He presents a glorious Man, One whom we can apprehend, for He is a Man and the fulness of the Godhead is in that Man bodily. Who would exchange that for a blank wall? It is well for us to see what things really are. The whole activity of the mind of man in an intellectual way for six thousand years leads him to a blank wall. God is behind the wall and they cannot reach Him. 'There is nothing greater in man than mind': what a positive lie of Satan. There is something far greater in man than mind; he has a spirit that he has received from God, the spirit that God made for the very purpose of man having to do with Him; that is something far greater in man than mind. The blessed truth of God meets all the need of the spirit of man. We want God and God wants us. He is the Father of spirits, not of minds. God is concerned and His beloved servant was in an agony that in our spirits we might know the mystery of God. Everything that is of God centres in Christ, the fulness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily. If philosophy, the teachings of men and the elements of the world lead us to a blank wall, that will not do. Our spirits crave for the knowledge of God, we must have God, the exercise is awakened for God. That is what John means when he speaks of thirsting. I am not speaking now about conviction of sin or the sense of being in the good of atonement, but there is such a thing as thirst for God. The creature must have God, and the answer to that is, the fulness of the Godhead dwells in that glorious Man bodily. What God proposes in the gospel is that we should know all about Himself that it is possible for the creature to know, so that we may come into the riches of the full assurance of understanding, and that we may know all the things that to the natural man would be behind a blank wall.
{470}
Rem. The psalmist says, "My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God" (@Psalm 42: 2).
C.A.C. Yes, there is a sense that comes into the soul of distance from God but wanting God; in a sense I have not got God and I want Him. Then in the gospel God says, 'I want you, I want you to know Me'. God sets forth everything, that is the idea of the fulness of the Godhead. Every element that goes to make up the knowledge of God is in Christ; every feature, every characteristic, every spiritual quality, every attribute of God's blessed nature, all that is included in the fulness, and it all dwells in a risen and glorified Man now in heaven, it dwells in Him bodily.
Ques. Why is it bodily?
C.A.C. Does that not show how the whole mystery of God hangs upon the incarnation? Bodily suggests that the whole truth of the incarnation is there, so that God has come into evidence in a tangible form. It is remarkable that when John speaks of the Word of life he says, "Which ... our hands handled" (l @John 1: 1), he speaks of what he had heard, seen and contemplated, what his hands had handled, showing the tangibleness of it, showing what the incarnation has brought about. All that is spiritual has become tangible so that we might apprehend it. All the philosophy of men is intangible, the whole system of speculation that floats about in the air; and the only substance to be found is a blank wall. When we come to Christ, all the fulness of the Godhead is set forth in a Man in a body. We need to pray for the apprehension of what is presented to us. God is telling us about this tonight, that the fulness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily. We accept it and now we have to pray for apprehension that we may be able to grasp it intelligently, so that what is set forth in Christ may be apprehended.
Ques. Our eyes are opened in the gospel, but is spiritual sight necessary to see all this?
C.A.C. Yes, spiritual sight is necessary, and the riches
{471}
of the full assurance of understanding; that is the line we are on here. The Christian is the most intelligent man that lives. It is not that you discard the mind of man because it is elevated, but you discard it because it is debased, unholy and infidel; it finds pleasure in leaving God out. Scripture says, "All his thoughts are, There is no God!" (@Psalm 10: 4). So in the first chapter of this epistle it speaks of being "enemies in mind" (verse 21). The mind of man is hostile to God, but the Christian as having a renewed mind has a mind of an elevated character, and he has an understanding far superior to that of the natural mind. I think the Lord is exercising us at the present time about the greatness of the incarnation. We have all professed to believe that a divine Person became Man, and we do believe it in a certain sense, but we have not apprehended the greatness of it; that calls for exercise and prayer and meditation, it calls for enlargement. There is an immensity there to be explored which will fill eternity, but all that is set forth in the fulness of the Godhead is set forth to be apprehended, not to be unknown and unappreciated. I think the fulness of the Godhead is not exactly the being of God which is inscrutable, but the fulness means there is not a detail wanting, not an element of any part of God's nature and character that is not set forth for our apprehension. Nothing is held in reserve that it is possible to know. There are things in the Deity which it is impossible for the creature to know; there must ever be an immense distance between the Creator and the creature, between God and His creature, but the Fulness conveys to us the thought of the completeness that is set forth of everything that can be known of God by the creature; all is there in Christ.
Ques. Is Godhead a relative term?
C.A.C. I thought so. It is the Godhead viewed in relation to the creature, so that in chapter 1 we are told, "In him all the fulness of the Godhead was pleased to dwell, and by him to reconcile all things to itself, ... whether the
{472}
things on the earth or the things in the heavens" (verses 20, 21). It is the fulness of the Godhead viewed in relation to creation.
Ques. What you speak of in Deity is unknown except to divine Persons, but is the Godhead more in relation to creation?
C.A.C. I thought so. In Colossians the whole scope of creation comes into view, the whole sphere in which God has operated in creation comes into view. That I believe is the mystery of God, and it stands in relation to the whole of creation. Therefore you get a view of Christ here which goes far beyond what He is to us; we see that He is ever so much greater than what would be, for instance, needed to fill the church; that does not exceed His ability.
Ques. Would reconciling all things to Itself go as far as creation?
C.A.C. I thought so. Of course, things in the heavens and things on the earth take in all that man can take knowledge of, and it is all going to be reconciled and be made pleasurable to God. The wonderful thing is that the mystery of God lies in this, that God has designed that Christ shall be the Head of the whole created universe.
Rem. That would be chapter 1: 16.
C.A.C. Yes. By Him were created all things. Christ is the Creator of all things, but then having created all things He has actually come into the system which He created. God in the Person of Christ not only created, but has come into the creation by becoming Man; He has taken up a place in the creation and therefore He can be spoken of as the Firstborn of all creation. If the Creator comes into the created system He must take the first place in it, He could have no other place. He takes the first place and He is going to be Head of the whole creation, so that there will not be a single thing in the universe that is according to God that does not derive from Christ. It is a great thing to get hold of that remarkable fact.
{473}
Ques. Is chapter 1: 18 a new sphere; is it in resurrection that He actually takes the place of the Beginning?
C.A.C. Yes. He takes that place as having died; that is the wonderful thing. Sin came into the created universe, and if it was all to be reconciled to God, it must be on the basis which secured the removal of sin according to the pleasure of God. So the Creator has become a Man in order that He might die; death is the divine penalty attaching to sin, and the Creator has become Man in order that through death He might effect reconciliation. It is a divine Person who has become Man and who has gone into death; He is going to be the Head of all creation. That is the greatness of Christ, and where is philosophy after that? The verses we are speaking of go on to say, "Ye are complete in him, who is the head of all principality and authority".
Ques. I should like to ask what is involved in that word "complete"?
C.A.C. The way we are set up with God is equal to the way in which God is set before us in Christ. The fulness of the Godhead is set before us in Christ; it is absolutely complete, not an element lacking on that side; and on the other side we are complete in the same blessed Person. We are just as complete in the way we are set up in the presence of the fulness of the Godhead -- as complete in every detail -- as the outshining of God in Christ is complete; that is christianity. You cannot think of adding anything to that. What is philosophy? It does not appeal to you one bit. The word "complete" is really 'filled full' (see note d, Darby Translation). "In him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily; and ye are complete [filled full] in him". It is fulness on our side. What we need to see is that Christ has taken on the side of creation. The Creator has taken a place on the side of creation that He might fill all creation out of His own fulness, and in so doing He secures a perfect answer to everything there is in the fulness of the
{474}
Godhead. We have a whole creation -- heaven and earth -- answering perfectly to God, and that for eternity. The assembly is the first family to be brought into the understanding and apprehension of it, so that we may glorify God for the greatness of that mystery which He has made known to us. It is most blessed to see that everything is going to answer perfectly to God because the perfect answer is secured in Christ, the One in whom the fulness of the Godhead was brought out to us in every detail. In that same Person every detail on the side of the creature has been secured in absolute perfection. It is secure in the Head, and what is secured in the Head abides for eternity.
We want to pray for apprehension of the Head. We pray a great deal for realisation, but what we mean really is apprehension, that is what we want. The realisation is in Christ; it is all realised and verified in Christ, but we have to come into the spiritual apprehension of it; it is all there to be apprehended. As we come into it we get these wonderful "riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the full knowledge of the mystery of God". Then we become men of stature; we graduate in the university of God.
I thought there was a figure of this in the tabernacle where you have certain vessels in which what is of God is set forth. There are the ark, the mercy-seat and the candlestick all of gold; they set forth what is divine; you might say the fulness of the Godhead is set forth in these things. But then you also get the table and the golden altar; in these you have the answer. The golden table sustained the twelve loaves representing all Israel -- all the people of God are sustained there in a way that corresponded with the vessels in which what is purely divine is set forth. In the golden altar you have the thought of approach to God; it is equal to the revelation. Then you have another thing, you have the priests. There is a long chapter (@Exodus 28) describing the vestments of the priests; they are for glory and for ornament. If you study the robes of the priests, the
{475}
breastplate and the shoulder-pieces, etc., you will find that there is everything there which corresponds with the glory of God. There is correspondence in a man so that before the system broke down by the sin of Nadab and Abihu, Aaron could go in in his garments of beauty and ornament as the one who corresponded perfectly with the glory of God. He could go in representing all the people, he was the head. Israel had a head in Aaron, and until the system broke down it represented typically the outshining of God on the one side, and then the priestly head corresponded in every detail with the pleasure of God. You might have said to any Israelite, 'Are you perfectly furnished in relation to God?' If he had been an intelligent man he would have said, 'Yes, I am perfectly complete in Aaron, I have a priestly head who is there in perfect suitability to God; I am complete in him'. The priest is head. The whole system is secured and maintained in Christ as Head and we are complete in Him; He is Head of all principality and authority. These poor Colossians did not know what they were doing, they were worshipping angels. Paul corrects them by saying that the Christ, in whom you are complete, is the Head of all principality and authority. There is not a dignity, not a created being in the universe of God, to whom Christ does not stand as Head.
What a moment it will be when God brings Him out as the Firstborn! He is going to bring Him into the habitable world as the Firstborn; then what will be the first thing to happen? All the angels of God will worship their Head, that is the mystery of God, and that is the explanation of the marvellous scene in @Revelation 5 where we find the twenty-four elders singing the song of redemption; they are ascribing worthiness and honour to the Lamb because He was slain and had redeemed to God by His blood out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation. That has to do with men, and then we find the Spirit of God introduces a marvellous company; their number was ten thousands of
{476}
ten thousands and thousands of thousands. It is the whole universal assembly of heaven, and they all celebrate their Head. They cannot say that He has redeemed them, but they celebrate Him as their glorious Head. That is the greatness of Christ, and God has privileged us to come together to learn it even now in the time when Christ is despised; God has shown us this to teach us a little more that we are filled full in Him.
It is wonderful to see what a great Person He is. This is the great divine conception, that there never will be any feature in the creation that answers to God that did not originate in Christ. He brings in every feature that answers to God, all comes in in the Head. Israel will have to learn this same lesson, they will have to learn that everything that is of God and for God is brought in in the Head. When they see that, they will bless themselves in Him, "Men shall bless themselves in him" (@Psalm 72: 17).
I believe it is the apprehension of this that prepares us for circumcision; we begin to see that everything that is of the flesh is an encumbrance, a thing it would be a relief to get rid of. I do not think that any of us will come to the truth of circumcision until we are thankful to be circumcised. You get such a sense of how you are filled full in Christ that everything derived from Adam becomes not only unnecessary but an offensive intrusion, that you are ready to say the happiest day in your life would be the day when you could cut it off. Now God says, 'I have done it for you, I have cut it off in the circumcision of Christ, in Christ's death'. Paul says, "Far be it from me to boast save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ" (@Galatians 6: 14). He is not facing the cross as a terrible thing but as the proper ground of glory. He says, 'I will glory in having done with the world and with the flesh'. Why? Because he knew what it was to be filled full in Christ. If we get an apprehension of Christ as Head, we shall have done with the mind of man, the intellect and speculations of man; we shall have done
{477}
with that and with the body of the flesh. I believe there is an intentional contrast thrown by the Spirit of God between the bodily form in which the fulness of the Godhead dwells and the body of the flesh which comprises the totality of everything we derive from the fallen man. All that man is in mind and body, the Christian is privileged to know, has been cut off for him in the circumcision of the Christ, and he gladly falls in with what God has done. That is the lesson we all need to learn; I believe those of us who know it best, know it but imperfectly. In the presence of the greatness of Christ and in the sense of what it is to be complete, filled full in Him, we should be very thankful for circumcision and burial by baptism. We do not come to it until we are thankful for it; it comes in the way of relief. We see how God has freed us; He has filled us full in our Head, and we do not want any other. Christ has come into the place of sinful flesh, and that sinful flesh has been cut off vicariously in His death. We come into the apprehension of it, so it forms no part of our spiritual status at all. We are entitled to be with God as completely apart from the flesh as if we were already in heaven. It is a faith position, and we can be with God in that faith position and rejoice in it. We do not feel it has cut us off from the things we should like, but it has cut us off from the things we dislike because we are enriched in all the greatness of Christ. That is a remarkable truth of christianity.
{478}
NOTES OF A READING @COLOSSIANS 2: 9 - 23
C.A.C. Apparently the Colossians stood in the truth of Romans and also of 1 Corinthians. The apostle says, "Seeing your order", which would be 1 Corinthians, and "The firmness of your faith in Christ", which would be Romans surely. I suppose that is for most of us here tonight; we know something of having come to faith in Christ according to Romans and have some idea of assembly order according to l Corinthians, but the apostle is anxious to bring us on to something further; that is, the truth of the body and the headship of Christ.
It is remarkable that when the truth of the assembly was recovered a little more than one hundred years ago, it came about through a young clergyman in Ireland getting the thought that there was a Head in heaven. Then the next thought he got was, if there is a Head in heaven, there is a body on earth. He got hold of two immense spiritual realities that had not been known at all since the departure of the apostles.
Rem. The reception of the truth of the Reformation would be the reception of Romans, so that what follows would be in a way moral sequence.
C.A.C. Of course what has marked the revival of the truth in the last one hundred years, I suppose, is the saints coming to the reality of what it is to be risen with Christ.
Rem. Would it be a matter of spiritual state or of position?
C.A.C. I thought it was what we received from God as light, and therefore it comes by faith; it is "through faith of the working of God who raised him from among the dead" (verse 12). The great thought of being complete in Christ is at the basis of all this.
Ques. Why is it put, "Ye are complete in him, who is
{479}
the head of all principality and authority"?
C.A.C. He wishes to bring before us the wide and immense scope that comes under the Head. "Head of all principality and authority". Well, that gives a wonderful touch to the thought of being complete in Him. That is, every power in dignity or eminence is to take character from Christ. It is a fact that the saints are complete in Him. We have to receive that as a divine statement, and then seek to understand what is involved in it.
Rem. Both are positive facts, "Who is head of all principality and authority", and "Ye are complete in him".
C.A.C. If God did not state things in that way we should never get hold of them. He states how they are in His mind; God knows well enough what is in His mind and He wants the saints to come to what is in His mind. It is a comfort to see we have nothing to do but come to what is in God's mind. This would make us willing to accept circumcision. If you are complete in Christ you can very well afford to dispense with the other man who is not.
I think "principality and authority" might go beyond the earth. I suppose the principalities and powers of which Christ is Head will not have to be set aside, but there are others which God has spoiled and exposed in their evil character and triumphed over them. We have to do not only with man's wickedness but with powers greater than man which have a great influence on him. Our conflict is with principalities and powers in heavenly places, powers of darkness and of evil, powers that do not acknowledge the headship of Christ, and that very fact exposes them as evil. I think men are today largely the dupes of these powers. Man prides himself on originating all kinds of thoughts that are against God and against Christ, but he does not originate them.
Ques. Do we not travel through Romans and Corinthians in the thought of headship and now reach Colossians?
{480}
C.A.C. We get the Head in a new way in Colossians, as the Source of everything. It is to bring us in our minds to see that everything centres in and proceeds from this great and glorious Person -- a divine Person come into manhood and now risen and glorified -- and that His death is really what cuts us off from the man we were once identified with to come under this new and glorious Head. So we all have to be circumcised with the circumcision of Christ, and that is His death.
Rem. I suppose reconciliation would be the same thing.
C.A.C. We have to come into line with this in our minds, as what is in the mind of God (we are not actually raised with Christ), and we are privileged to see that the death of Christ is really what cuts us off from the man we were once linked with. Hence He leads us on to see that there is a body that stands in definite relation to Him as Head. It is remarkable that there is nothing about sonship, or children, or the church as the wife or bride of Christ here; it is all about the body. All that is in the body proceeds from Christ, "The body is of Christ" (verse 17).
Circumcision is an inward exercise, as it says in Romans, "of the heart, in spirit" (chapter 2: 29). Thus baptism follows circumcision in Colossians, and is burial with Christ. It is the apprehension of what took place in His death, really the end of all I am as in the flesh. It was actually the end of that man before God, not in me, but in Christ. Well then, what sort of place do I want in the world? Every true believer would say, "What hinders my being baptised?" (@Acts 8: 36). Then there is what answers to it in the public position, and then what follows -- for here baptism takes us as far as resurrection -- there is the coming up out of the water. Baptism is at the Red Sea; in the type they were not circumcised until over the Jordan. So that publicly we have to be in accord with our baptism. I remember once being offered a book on baptism, stated on the cover to be written
{481}
by a B.A. I asked the one who offered it, 'Does that attach to the man that went down into the water or to the man that came up?' 'I suppose to the man that went down', was the answer. I said, 'Well, I do not care to read what is written about baptism by a man not knowing anything about it'.
Rem. "The circumcision of the Christ" (verse 11) -- the truth of it is all set out there.
C.A.C. Yes, it shows how God has brought everything into the death of Christ -- the whole thing is gone -- the old man gone.
Rem. All three -- circumcision, baptism and being raised -- are necessary if we are to be here as part of the body.
C.A.C. It is most important to see that.
Ques. Would it be like @Romans 6, identification with Him?
C.A.C. In Romans he looks on to it as future; here it is something we are brought to at the present time. It is nothing in me; we are brought to the mind of God, that God has raised Christ from among the dead; and if I have the faith of that, I can take the ground of having been raised. We have to be quickened to be in the conscious good of it; that is, the saints are made to live in their affections in the truth of being risen with Christ. Now that is a thing to pray about, because quickening is an actual operation of God; that is, we are either quickened or not quickened. He is the only One who can make us live in our affections in relation to Christ as risen with Him. It is incomprehensible to an unconverted man in the world. What is remarkable is that God is said to have done so much. He has quickened, forgiven offences, effaced the handwriting in ordinances, spoiled principalities and powers -- God has done it all.
Rem. Quickening puts you right outside man's world. A risen man is not coming back to the earth, he is going to heaven.
Ques. There are two states in verses 11 and 13:
{482}
circumcised and uncircumcised. "In whom also ye have been circumcised", is that how we come to it?
C.A.C. Yes, and by the quickening power. Quickening is always out of death. It has been said that resurrection is relative to all that is behind it, and quickening is relative to what is before. We are quickened for an entirely new order of things outside of the region of death entirely, and we ought to touch this character of things, especially when we are in assembly.
Ques. Would you say @John 20 touches this quickening power?
C.A.C. Yes, it is really the life of the risen Man breathed into them. How could you live in this life without quickening? It is a marvellous thought to me, that we should have the life of Christ. For quickening causes one to live in one's affections in all these wonderful things that have come to light in the death of Christ. I pray constantly, I think daily, for this quickening power.
Rem. The Holy Spirit is vital for this.
C.A.C. There is no doubt it is very connected with the Holy Spirit, but that is not brought in in Colossians. It is here rather the fulness of Christ and what we may derive from His fulness, and everything being set aside in His death that is contrary to God, so that we may be set free from ordinances, and so on.
Ques. "He made a show of them publicly". When was that?
C.A.C. I suppose it was done at the cross. There were certain powers acting against Christ -- the chief priests, the rulers and Pilate -- but behind these men were certain powers of the invisible world prompting them, and God stripped these powers, making manifest that they were all against Christ. "The ruler of this world is judged" (@John 16: 11). The fact is he led the world to the point of crucifying Christ -- that was his judgment. What did Peter and Paul think of the leaders of Israel when they crucified Christ?
{483}
They were all exposed and God has triumphed over them. It looked like public defeat, but actually Christ was the Victor.
Rem. "Having nailed it to the cross", it says (verse 14).
C.A.C. It would seem that these Gentiles of Colosse had subjected themselves to ordinances. "Why as if alive in the world do ye subject yourselves to ordinances?" (verse 20). They had signed their name to it (see note g, verse 14). The same thing is seen today. People sign the pledge, for instance.
Rem. That is not circumcision.
C.A.C. No, exactly the contrary, it is just what Paul is condemning. Every obligation of that kind that I have put myself under has been nailed to the cross.
Rem. It is applied to the man in the flesh.
C.A.C. A Christian as a dead and risen man is on quite a different ground. What is very good for man in the flesh is positively evil when brought into christianity. All these things apply to a living man. If I have come to it that I have died with Christ, I do not think of signing a pledge that I will not drink, and so on. If the thing is nailed to the cross of Christ it is very foolish for me to go on with it. All that could be imposed as an ordinance on man in the flesh is what Christ suffered for to make an end of.
Rem. So that Christ Himself came under law, "come of woman, come under law" (@Galatians 4: 4).
C.A.C. But then there was an end of that when He died; it had no more to say to Him. That was all ended when He gave up His spirit. It really comes to this: there is a body now which is of Christ, so that all these other things are a shadow. It is a great thing for us to get hold of the fact that we are of the body. I think it is much more difficult to get at than the thought of children or sons.
The substance is the body; all the substance of things now for God is in the body, all that is derived from Christ. Nothing in me that is not of Christ is the body, "The body
{484}
is of Christ". It is what is so little understood. We see here it is outside all that is religious. The enemy was on the line of introducing what was religious in a fleshly way. The apostle is anxious to show them they are really outside all that. So that to be turned aside to these things was to be fraudulently deprived of their prize. Humility is a devilish thing when it does not give place to Christ. I have in my time come across people proud of their humility. "And not holding fast the head" (verse 19) -- that is the important matter.
Ques. And that is connected with the body. Will you say a word on "Increases with the increase of God" (verse 19)?
C.A.C. It is, "All the body, ministered to and united together by the joints and bands, increases with the increase of God". It is a remarkable thing; there are no gifts in Colossians, but there are joints and bands, and so far as I see, a sister might be a joint and band as much as a brother. I think the reason is He is seeking to put each one of us in direct personal contact with the Head. If He had bestowed a gift, the gift might be between Him and me, and He says, 'I want you in personal contact with Myself'. It is sweet to think of it. I am in a position in which I can draw directly from the Head and get something for myself, something perhaps that no saint ever got before. The body is of the Head and draws everything from the Head, and would move together beautifully. As children of God we are all alike, as sons of God we are all alike, but in the body we are not nor shall we be to all eternity; we are co-ordinated.
What is given by the Head is never given to be kept by the individual who gets it, but for the good of the body. We should all be ready to talk about what we get. There would be wonderful power if all the saints were free to talk about what they get from the Head.
The gifts in Ephesians come from the ascended Christ, but not from the Head. The body increases with the increase of God. It is intended to come out as the saints are together so that it is seen that there is a spiritual formation
{485}
there that is of God -- that is of God and for God. Indeed, F.E.R. used to tell us the body was the worshipping company.
{486}
NOTES OF A READING @COLOSSIANS 2: 9 - 23
C.A.C. Certain things follow upon the apprehension of being complete, or filled full in Christ, the Head. Circumcision and burial follow in the spiritual setting of this chapter; they follow upon the apprehension of being filled full in Christ, so the cutting off of the flesh is seen to be a positive advantage. It is important to see that it says, "In whom also ye have been circumcised"; that is, it is not in yourself. Circumcision is a question of cutting off, and burial is a question of putting out of sight; they are both negative. When it is a question of being raised with Christ, that is the positive side, so we begin with the apprehension of being filled full in the Head. We were speaking last week of the greatness of the Head. He is Head of all principality and authority, not only Head for men, but Head over everything that has dignity and authority and eminence in the moral universe. He is great enough to be Head of the whole of God's universe; so if we are filled full in Him we have a wonderful furnishing; nothing that is of the flesh is required to fill out that furnishing. We do not want even the best bit of the flesh; if we could have flesh in the most beautiful, refined, intellectual or religious form, we do not want it because it is not Christ. Being filled full in Christ, we are not only made spiritually independent of any contribution from the flesh, but we begin to see that any contribution from the flesh is obnoxious. It would be introducing a wrong element, something altogether foreign to God's universe. All God's moral universe is brought into view; how great it is, and it is all going to be filled out of the greatness of Christ. There is a complete furnishing in the fulness of Christ, and it is a furnishing in His fulness, not out of it. We do not draw out of it but we are brought into the vastness and moral splendour of it.
{487}
Then in Him also we are circumcised. There is a new kind of circumcision. The apostle speaks of a circumcision made without hands. That is to show it is a moral and spiritual thing. It is not a circumcision in the flesh, done by human hands -- the hand of man cannot circumcise the heart and spirit -- this is circumcision of the heart, in spirit. We were saying lately that when God introduces a thought He never gives it up. You cannot find anything God has introduced in the Old Testament that He has given up. He has secured it all in christianity in a greater and more real and spiritual way. So now instead of men being circumcised in the flesh, they are circumcised in the heart, in spirit. Paul tells the Romans that that is the true character of circumcision; that is, it is something inward, in contrast with burial, which is public. Circumcision is connected with the inward exercises of our hearts and spirits, and nobody knows anything about it; a man who is buried disappears from the public view. We get in circumcision and burial what may be called the inward and the outward -- one has to do with the heart and with the spirit, and the other has to do with the public life.
There is an inward filling, a filling full in Christ; it is what you apprehend in your soul. He is adequate to fill the moral universe of God, so there will not be a vestige of anything in God's moral universe, nor in the angelic world, or anywhere else, that is not headed up in Christ. If I am filled full in that great and glorious Person then I apprehend another thing, that in Christ, in the Head, I am circumcised, not in a fleshly way but in a spiritual way. "Circumcision not done by hand in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of the Christ". It is important to notice that the Authorised Version says, "Putting off the body of the sins of the flesh", but it should be the putting off of the body of the flesh, that is the totality of it. Everything that we derive from Adam, all that has been put off in the circumcision of the Christ, has been cut off in the death of
{488}
Christ. There comes a moment when we value the thought of it. I remember the day when I first appreciated that thought as a blessed deliverance -- that every atom of the flesh was cut off in the death of Christ. You come to it secretly in your mind and heart; you can tell God how thankful you are to be circumcised in Christ. It is most delivering and emancipating. You arrive at this inwardly, it is a secret between yourself and God.
Ques. We may see the light of it, but what about the power?
C.A.C. It is not altogether a question of power but of illumination, light in the soul; God gives you this light in Christ. You have been circumcised with this spiritual circumcision which means a complete cutting off of the flesh in the death of Christ. It comes to you as a relief and you apprehend it. You have been trying, perhaps, to make something of this old flesh, to tinker it up in some way, but you come to appreciate that it is cut off.
Ques. Does it go further than oneself?
C.A.C. Yes. We taste it first as liberty in regard to ourselves, but it is far reaching, it is the flesh in its totality, not only in me but in every other man. We do not look for contributions from the flesh; it can only be an intrusion and obnoxious. There is deliverance from the whole system in which flesh could have a place. It is very wide in that way, but the soul comes to it as the light of deliverance, so it is a relief and comfort to know it, because we want to think everything of Christ; we want Him to have the first place in all things. We do not want to be like Ishmael who was circumcised outwardly but not in heart and spirit. When Isaac came in -- the one with whom was God's covenant -- he mocked. Ishmael represents very much the religious flesh of today, taking the ground of being separated to God, circumcised one might say formally, but not inwardly, and so he mocks at Christ. Is everything to be made of Christ and am I to be nothing? Am I to have no place at all? That
{489}
is Ishmael's view of Him.
Ques. Is it necessary that we should know something of this before we can know anything of what God has before Him for us in Christ?
C.A.C. Yes, it comes in on the way to the apprehension of being risen with Christ. As we are risen with Christ, a sphere of life comes into view and it is in that sphere of life that the wealth of the inheritance can be entered upon and enjoyed.
The test as to how far this inward process has gone on with us comes out when it is a question of burial; that answers in a public way to the inward exercise of circumcision. "Buried with him in baptism" takes us a little further than Romans. In Romans you are baptised, you are committed to the thing; it is ground on which you are set publicly and formally as having faith in Christ. You are set in a certain position. "We have been buried therefore with him by baptism unto death, in order that, even as Christ has been raised up from among the dead by the glory of the Father, so *we* also should walk in newness of life" (@Romans 6: 4). We have been committed to it, every baptised person is committed to it. But it seems to me that in Colossians it is looked at as being come to intelligently, so that there is no desire to bring into public evidence the man after the flesh. You can take a position publicly in which that man is kept out of sight. I will give a simple illustration to make it clear. I had a book put into my hand some little time ago by a Christian, which he was anxious I should read. It was a pamphlet on baptism and it said on the cover that it was written by so and so, B.A. I asked the man who offered it to me, 'Which man do you think the B.A. attaches to, to the man who went down into the water, or the one who comes up?' He replied, 'I suppose it must attach to the man who went down'. I said then, 'Why are you asking me to read a book written by a man who puts outside it that he does not know anything about baptism?' It would be quite different
{490}
for a man to put B.A. or any other letters on his brass plate if he were a schoolmaster or a doctor because that gives him professional status in the world. But I would not like him to advertise B.A. if he were going to preach the gospel, as if it gave him status as a servant of Christ or a Christian. That is where burial comes in, as to whether we take any place publicly that brings the man after the flesh into evidence. It is testing. We may not do it in a glaring way like that, but we are very apt to do it in some way, and while professing to hold all this truth we can be very inconsistent with burial. We do not want to bring in the man after the flesh with his intellect, his mind or any of his ways, we do not want to bring him into evidence. Your desire and your prayer if you have come to apprehend baptism is that you do not want a bit of the flesh to come into view. That leads to a public character of walk which is consistent with the truth, and people can take account of that.
It is a wonderful thing to have come to, that Christ is our life. Is Christ my life? It is just in the same sense that the world is the life of the worldling; if you could take the world away from him, you have taken away his life, for he has no other life; he would tell you so. For the Christian, Christ has become his life; everything that is truly life is Christ. It is very marvellous that One who is hidden in heaven should be our life, that He should be the very life of people living down here. If we rejoice in Him with joy unspeakable and filled with the glory (@1 Peter 1: 8), He is our life; it is a very good commentary on this.
All this is leading on to the great truth of being raised with Christ. There is a thought of what has emerged in a sphere of life. There has been a wonderful working of God in raising Christ from the dead; Christ has emerged, He has been in death, He has been buried, but by the working of God He has emerged into a sphere of life. We could not possibly bring Christ back into the life of this world. If
{491}
Christ cannot be brought back, and I am filled full in Christ, and circumcised in Him, and buried in baptism, I am ready to apprehend the wonderful working of God. It is a question of faith, it is not realisation but apprehension. It is in Christ, *in whom* (it is not in baptism) we are raised by faith of the working of God who raised Him from the dead. It would be very helpful to us if we realised that we cannot bring Christ back into the life of the world. Mary would have been glad to bring the Lord back into the life of the world; yet not even His life could be brought back, though it was a life so perfect and delightful to God, nothing in it offensive to God but everything pleasing to God. Love could not bring Him back. The Lord says to Mary, "Touch me not"; you cannot bring Me back. If there is to be company with Him it must be on His side; He is not coming back to our side, we must go to His side. I have often thought it is illustrated in David speaking of his child dying. David says, "I shall go to him, but he will not return to me" (@2 Samuel 12: 23). You can apply that to Christ: He has gone out of this world by death and burial. He has emerged from death by the working of God. It is impossible to bring Him back to the life of the world, but we can be associated with Him in life outside the world; that is the simple truth of christianity. We have to come to the faith of it; it is a matter of faith. Some of us may not have come to the light of it but God can give it to us tonight. God gives it to us as light; it is faith of the working of God; that is how we reach what it is to be raised with Christ.
Paul assumes in the next chapter that they had reached that point; "If therefore ye have been raised with the Christ". He assumes that we all ought to understand this, to have the faith of it, that we are raised with Christ to live with Him in that sphere of life into which He has entered, having emerged from death by the working of God. That is the truth and we are to have the faith of it. Of course, having the faith of it does not necessarily mean that we are
{492}
living there. We begin with the faith of it, and then there is a further divine operation necessary if we are to live there.
That is, we must be quickened, and that is a divine operation, not in Christ but in us. We are not quickened in Christ, we are complete in Christ, circumcised in Christ, and we are raised in Christ. But when it comes to quickening -- that is, being made to live in our affections with Christ -- that is something further.
I think it would be something like this. There are certain steps in light that we take. God gives us the light of certain things in Christ until we reach this point that we are raised with Him by faith of the working of God. Faith brings us to that, and then there is an operation of God that goes along with it. One could not think of being raised with Christ through faith of the operation of God, and not being quickened. This operation on God's part will surely be there; God confers the capacity to live in this new region with Christ. We recognise that saints have capacity, spiritual vitality; they have been quickened, so that in their affections they can live with Christ. This is a blessed reality. We may remember that, when the child of the Shunammite died, what Elisha did was figurative of the quickening process. Gehazi had been sent with the staff, but he comes back and says, "The lad is not awaked" (@2 Kings 4: 31). Of course not; the staff would speak of power, but something more was needed. Nothing but the contact of the living prophet would do. The power of life in Elisha had to come into personal contact with the child -- he lies upon it -- and puts his mouth on his mouth, and so on. He comes into the closest contact with it, and we are told that the flesh of the child grew warm. That is quickening. What a moment it is when there is a living point of contact established by God with a living Christ, so that there is a warming of the affections, and with warmed affections we can find delight in living with Christ now. Then the child sneezed; now you have life in energy, there is an energetic manifestation; and
{493}
then he opens his eyes. All these things are connected with quickening. The christian company according to this presentation is made to live in affection for Christ. There is complete liberation from everything that would fetter the spirit or hinder it from living there. All these things that have been there before, what he speaks of as offences and the handwriting in ordinances, are dealt with. If one had one's offences round one's neck, how they would drag one down! If one had taken up ordinances as a pious Jew did, a man like Saul of Tarsus, they only proved to be against the soul, they brought an obligation. If we are not free in regard of these things, they would absolutely hinder us from living together with Christ in our affections. If one is thinking of offences belonging to one's former history, it would hinder and hamper one terribly. So that the favourableness of God comes out even in relation to our offences; we have learned the disposition of God. The thought here is not remission of sins but the great favourableness of God to us, that He is not disposed to hold anything against us; we know the blessed heart of God.
Ques. What is signified by being nailed to His cross?
C.A.C. The handwriting of ordinances stood up against us; that is, not breaking the law but undertaking to keep it; that kind of obligation is entirely effaced. What we see here is persons taking up ordinances, not God imposing them. The Jew had known what it was to take up ordinances, but now the Gentile is doing it, and Paul expresses his surprise at them and says, 'If you take up ordinances you are alive in the world'. "If ye have died with Christ from the elements of the world, why as if alive in the world do ye subject yourselves to ordinances?" Paul tells them, 'We have tried that long before you; we found when we signed our names to that document we were committed to something that stood against us for ever after'. It was not breaking the law that was against them, but assuming the ground that they were able to keep it.
{494}
Rem. This gives the man in the flesh a place.
C.A.C. Yes, that is why the cross comes in. God has nailed this bond which the Jew had signed to the cross. It was his own handwriting he had made himself responsible to, he had charged himself with the whole system of ordinances and it was a millstone round his neck. How could a man like that live with Christ? What was to be done? God says, 'I have dealt with it, and taken and nailed it to the cross'. The cross was the public dealing with the criminal who could not be suffered to live any longer. Now Christ has been there on our behalf. People make vows and promises, and pledge themselves to do this and not do that, and they sign their names to it until it becomes a millstone round their necks which will hinder them most effectually from living with Christ. The seriousness of all this is that a great deal in the present course of things in christianity is to get people to commit themselves to do certain things, and to abstain from certain other things. Until they see that it has all been nailed to the cross, they will never be free to live together with Christ. This is the very reverse of something bad as man would say; it is undertaking to be and to do what is good, what is acceptable to God, but undertaking it as man in the flesh. Paul says, 'You must see that gone'. These questions of ordinances had been worked out by the Jew, and now the devil is seeking to lead the gentile believers to take up ordinances, to take up these questions of "Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch". That is a man alive in the world. We need to note carefully the difference between the us and the you. Paul writing to the Jew says, "us", but in writing to the Gentile he says, "you".
I think all this is very useful as showing us what christianity is, and showing us the sphere in which God would have us to live as those who are quickened together with Christ in a sphere outside the world.
{495}
NOTES OF A READING @COLOSSIANS 2: 15 - 23
C.A.C. It is helpful to see that the things mentioned in verses 13 - 15 are what God has done. God has quickened the saints together with Christ, He has forgiven all offences, He has effaced handwriting in ordinances, He has taken it out of the way having nailed it to the cross, He has spoiled principalities and authorities -- we are in the region of divine actings. It is very comforting and establishing to have before us the actings of God.
Ques. What is your thought of "leading them in triumph by it"?
C.A.C. I suppose it is to show the completeness of the conquest. It was customary when great victories were gained for the conquered kings to be chained to the chariot wheels of the victors and led in triumph. It is remarkable the wide scope of what is brought before us both in this epistle and in that to the Ephesians. It goes wider than men; it brings in the thought of principalities and authorities. Christ has carried with Him on high the evidence of complete victory over every power that was adverse to God. We know from Scripture there are great powers of evil, and one might say that they have all come into action. Satan has no reserves, he has brought all his forces into action, and they have all been utterly defeated -- spoiled is the word, they have been rendered impotent. It is an immense comfort to see that.
Ques. Are all these activities for blessing?
C.A.C. Yes, certainly. To be quickened together with Christ is a wonderful blessing. He has been favourable to us, He has blotted out all that was against us. If every power that is adverse to God and to man as God's creature has been brought into action and been utterly defeated, that is an immense thing. We do not understand how great is the
{496}
victory which God has gained publicly over every malign power. Victory has been gained publicly so that every power of evil has been reduced to impotence. Do we believe it?
Ques. How was it public?
C.A.C. When the Lord Jesus Christ was in this world, was there any power of evil able to withstand Him? We have to think of Christ. The apostle is seeking to bring before us the greatness of Christ, and the greatness of what has been effected by the public appearance of Christ in this world. The incarnation of Christ is the greatest public fact that ever transpired in the universe of God. God chose the battle and Christ came in, and came in publicly. Paul could say, "This was not done in a corner" (@Acts 26: 26). The Lord's baptism was public, and the descent of the Spirit upon Him was public, and He met all the power of the devil in the temptations. Indeed the words used by the Lord are very striking, He speaks of Satan as a strong man armed keeping his house until a stronger than he comes upon him and takes away his armour in which he trusted and spoils his goods (@Luke 11: 21, 22). It was all done publicly. There was a Man in this world who reduced the whole power of evil into impotence; it was powerless in the presence of Christ. So we are told He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed of the devil for God was with Him. Every power of evil had to give way, the powers were spoiled -- it was all done publicly.
Ques. Was the resurrection a part of this?
C.A.C. No doubt it was. It made manifest that there was One there who could not be held by death. He had come into death because He would righteously set free those who were under the power of evil, and He took upon Himself all the consequences of sin. He bore it all in love, so that sin and death might become witnesses of the love of God, and show how intense was the interest of God in His creature.
{497}
Rem. It was said after the temptation that the devil departed from Him for a season.
C.A.C. Yes. He mustered his forces again in the garden of Gethsemane, but all was defeated because there was perfect obedience and perfect dependence there in Christ; neither Satan nor his angels have the slightest power in presence of that. Satan has a certain armour in which he trusts; that is a remarkable word. I suppose that Satan having succeeded in displacing God from the confidence of His creature trusts that he can keep men away from God by the same means, and it is astonishing how confident people are in unbelief. But Satan has to reckon with the fact that One has come who is stronger than he. It is of the greatest comfort to me to think that the whole power of evil that has been arrayed against Christ has been defeated. There was One who absolutely defeated the whole range of power that was opposed to God; He has defeated it and made a show of it publicly. God has spoiled principalities and authorities, but He has done it in Christ, and it is in Him that they are led in triumph. God would occupy us with the greatness of Christ. The teaching of this epistle particularly is to bring out the greatness of what God has effected in Christ; we do not see the full results of it yet, "We see not yet all things subjected to *him*". We see the Victor crowned, and it has been made known to us that every evil power has been spoiled.
The principalities and authorities that we are speaking of now are authorities opposed to God because God has to defeat them and spoil them by Christ. But the principalities and authorities of a good character would be seen in verse 10; He "is the head of all principality and authority". Everything that has a place in God's universe is to own Christ as Head. There are certain evil powers who will not own Christ as Head, they have been publicly exposed. Every influence by which the power of evil can deceive and destroy men has been fully exposed and defeated when the
{498}
Lord was here on earth.
Ques. In verse 10 of this chapter He is spoken of as the Head and in chapter 1: 15 He is spoken of as Creator. Are the two connected?
C.A.C. All was created by Him and for Him. He created all these powers but the One who created them all is Head of them. He takes a place on the side of creation as Head. He, the Creator, as it were, comes over to the side of creation, and coming over to that side, is Head of it. Some principalities and powers do not own that government, they are rebellious, adverse to God and Christ, but all are defeated. In chapter 1, Christ is brought in as having "created all things, the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones, or lordships, or principalities or authorities"; these things are positions of dignity. Every such position that has come in came in that Christ might fill it. There is not a conception of dignity in the universe of God that is not going to be filled by Christ; it brings out His greatness. What a wonderful universe it will be when every influence in it and every authority exercised in it derives from Christ; He is great enough to fill the whole universe with beneficent influences. That is the One who is our Head, and our great exercise is to hold fast the Head.
As a matter of fact, these evil forces are still active, but it has been publicly manifested that Christ has been victorious over them all; they are all His lawful captives. We may not see it publicly now, but it is made known to faith; we have the joy and the delight of it in our souls. We do not need to fear any evil power. It is astonishing how men are held in bondage by superstitious fears; the world is more full of superstitious dread than we have any idea of. I believe that men almost universally have a dread of evil powers; they know there is a mysterious power of evil and they have a deep secret dread of it -- no one is free of it but the Christian. The Christian sees every evil power chained
{499}
to the chariot wheels of Christ, and the One who is completely superior to and has exposed everything of that kind is our glorious Head. It was God who was acting, God who was spoiling principalities and authorities, He made a show of them publicly, leading them in triumph *in Him* (see note h, Darby Translation). The *in Him* must be emphasised. God has gained a complete public victory over every power that was adverse to Him and to the blessing of man; that is part of the gospel. It looks at things on a wider range than we are apt to think of them. We think about men's sins needing forgiveness, and the state of sin from which they need deliverance, and the prospect of death and judgment which calls for relief. But there is another question which is greater, that is the existence in the universe of an immense and terrible power of evil which has succeeded in ruining the human race and darkening the minds of men as to God for six thousand years; that is very much more terrible than my state of sin. How is it I am a sinner and that all men are sinners? Because of the actings of tremendous forces of evil opposed to God. God tells us that in Christ He has exposed and defeated and publicly crushed every one of those forces; that is the divine fact of the gospel. I am sure we ought to take account of it. It is not often presented. We talk about man's sin and guilt, and man being liable to death and judgment, and that he is going to hell if not converted, but there is something far greater and more serious and terrible than all that. We should get back to the secret of things; Scripture helps us by telling us that God made man, and put him in a beautiful place, and did everything He could for His innocent creature, and that almost immediately a malign power appeared and desolated the whole thing. What a comfort it is to know that God brought a Man into this world who was absolutely invulnerable to the power that destroyed the world. He was invulnerable and invincible, and He absolutely defeated not only Satan but every principality
{500}
and power that was arrayed on Satan's side -- in Christ it is all manifestly led in triumph. That is a good gospel to preach, and it is a side of the gospel not too much dwelt upon. The reason is probably that we have not estimated the seriousness of the position. There is something far greater and more terrible than my being lost, and that is, the existence of a power that was able to bring me and all men into the position of lost sinners. How is that power going to be dealt with? God has dealt with it absolutely in Christ. The Man who got the victory has gone to the right hand of God, and wears the Victor's crown; neither death nor the devil and his angels will ever dispute that they are His lawful captives.
Ques. Would this answer to the walls of Jericho falling down?
C.A.C. The falling down of the walls of Jericho was the public spoiling and leading in triumph of all the power of the enemy; it was typically a complete destruction. Was there any power in Canaan that could stand if those walls fell down without a human hand touching them? It is a comfort to know that Satan and all his angels are spoiled and defeated. Nobody will be delivered until they see that; there will be some dread somewhere in the heart or mind.
Ques. Is verse 16 the shadow, whereas we have come to the substance in Christ?
C.A.C. There was evidently an influence working at Colosse to get the people of God to go back and take up the shadows. To us the Old Testament is not a book of shadows. I think a good many people still think that the Old Testament is a book of shadows, but the Lord would give us a sense that it is a book of substance. I hear of places where they never read the Old Testament in their readings; how narrow their outlook must be! There is an immense amount of substance in the Old Testament that we should never get from the New. There is an unfolding of the preciousness of Christ and of the perfection in detail of His
{501}
work in the Old Testament that we never could get from the New. You could never get from the New Testament what is unfolded to us in the books of Exodus and Leviticus, and if people neglect these books they will be lamentably ignorant of Christ, and their earnest study of the New Testament will never furnish them with what they learn of Christ in Exodus and Leviticus. As to these things -- meat and drink, feasts, new moon or sabbath -- they now have acquired spiritual substance to us. Christ having come into the shadows, the shadows have become substance. Until He appeared, these things remained shadows, but Christ has come in to every one of the shadows and they have become substance. So now there is a company of persons on this earth who can be spoken of as the body, and to these persons the shadows have become substance. The Lord "interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself" (@Luke 24: 27).
In that way He brought substance into that which had previously been shadows. The Colossians were in danger of it, but for us who are of the body, the body is of Christ. It refers to the christian company, a company who being of Christ are able to see Christ substantially in all the figures of the Old Testament.
I often think it is a little remarkable that he should speak of the new moon here. What has struck me about it is that it did not belong at all to the original institution of the typical system; it was added later. The sacrifices connected with the new moon were enjoined in @Numbers 28 after Aaron was dead and when Moses was just about to die and the people were just going into the land. It formed no part of the original system of sacrifices and offerings. It seems to me it suggests something that would come in after all the failure on the part of the people. After the history of failure in the wilderness, God gives a new unfolding of His mind showing that in spite of the failure that came in on man's side, God would have His portion. The new moon comes in
{502}
in connection with that, which suggests a revival. The moon is not a vessel of light in itself, it is a dependent vessel of light; and so it represents in Scripture a human vessel of light, whether it is Israel or the assembly. The thought of a new moon is very instructive to us because it is what we may look for after all the failure of the church; we may look for a renewed shining of Christ upon us so that we come afresh into the light of Christ and into the substance of all that is there in Christ. Then we get on to the line of increase. In @Numbers 28 you will find more than in any other chapter we get the thought of increase, the thought of what is additional. It says several times over that certain sacrifices are to be offered "besides" the others; that gives the thought of increase. The apostle is seeking to bring us in Colossians on to the line of increase in the apprehension of Christ, which is the true substance of everything for God. So we are to hold the Head, and if we do, the Head will be constantly ministering to us increase. The new moon begins very small; what marks it is a tiny silver line first, but every day you see increase. I have often thought there is a moral force in the new moon being mentioned here.
Rem. In @Ephesians 5: 14 it says, "Wake up, thou that sleepest, and arise up from among the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee".
C.A.C. That is progressive. The beginning of Christ shining would be like the new moon, just a streak of silver, and every day you see it more and more. Holding the Head would be like abiding in the shining; every day there is increase until you come to the full moon. In holding the Head we have the conditions of spiritual prosperity and increase, and as we hold the Head we shall be like the moon that shows an enlarged result of being in the light every day. We have to see to it that we are not turned aside by anything that is not Christ. There may be those who make a pretence of humility and worshipping angels but
{503}
they do not hold the Head. If we hold the Head we shall be continually getting more divine light and increase, and there will be knitting together. If we hold the Head, the Head ministers to us, and that is the way by which we are held together. We cannot be held together without contact with the Head, so that what we receive from the Head becomes the link that binds us to the brethren. Our great business is to be on the line of increase. If there is a constant looking to the Head I believe the Head will always be faithful. Such is the love of Christ that those who hold the Head will be constantly receiving something; nourishment will be ministered to them. Why is it? That I may be a joint and band in the body. The joints and bands hold the body together; then as I minister to others what I receive from the Head, there is a binding together, and the body comes into evidence as a living organism, a vital thing, and increases with the increase of God. God would not have us to be only orthodox believers who have the Scriptures and are no further on than they were twenty years ago. He would have us to hold the Head and get nourishment ministered to us direct from the Head. Then our business with the brethren is to communicate that which becomes a spiritual bond between us and every brother and sister we come in contact with. That is the vital bond. What I receive is ministered from the Head as a living bond between the Head and me; then I have something I can minister to the brethren, and as I do, it becomes a bond of the same character between me and the brethren as there is between the Head in heaven and me. That is the truth of the body; the body is not something that has arrived at finality, but something increasing all the time with the increase of God.
One would like to see the brethren really gathered in the truth of that. We talk about being gathered on the ground of the one body, but to be gathered in the vitality of the one body would be worth going in for. We cannot all be gifts
{504}
but we can all be joints and bands. We can do something to form a spiritual unbreakable link between myself and the Christians with whom I may come in contact. We want to cultivate that.
{505}
NOTES OF A READING @COLOSSIANS 3: 1 - 15
C.A.C. God would have His saints to keep their spirits on the ground that they have died with Christ and that they have been raised with Him. All the injunctions and teachings of men would regard us on other ground than that.
Rem. In both cases it is "If": "If ye have died with Christ" (chapter 2: 20), "If ... ye have been raised with the Christ" (chapter 3: 1).
C.A.C. Yes, it assumes the saints have taken that ground through divine teaching.
Rem. They are entitled to do so, and he seeks to bring them to it.
C.A.C. It is where we are inwardly, for outwardly and publicly we are not dead and risen. It is something to be apprehended spiritually and it would liberate us from ordinances and injunctions and commandments and teachings of men. They look very nice often, as it says, "Which have indeed an appearance of wisdom in voluntary worship, and humility, and harsh treatment of the body" (chapter 2: 23). All that is for the satisfaction of the flesh. It is just what is developed in christendom. The enemy was seeking to bring it in amongst the gentile believers at Colosse. These things have got in and they characterise the great part of the christian profession, so it is very important that we should understand our place as dead with Christ and risen with Him. That is our place according to the thoughts of God.
Rem. All these things suggest the possibility of improving what is of the flesh.
C.A.C. I suppose there is a certain honour due to the body, and people would make out a kind of righteousness in treating the body badly. It is right to honour the body; a
{506}
certain honour is due to it because it is the temple of the Holy Spirit. The body is a member of Christ as being the temple of the Holy Spirit, so that God gives it a place of honour; that is, these physical bodies are members of Christ. Well, that gives the body a place of great honour.
Ques. Would you help us as to "the things which are above"? "Seek the things which are above, where the Christ is". J.N.D. places a comma there, after "is".
C.A.C. Well, it is important that we should understand where Christ is. The first chapter is rather to give us some sense of who He is, but the third chapter would lead us to where He is.
Rem. The Israelites forgot Moses when he went up.
C.A.C. It is quite possible for believers to get into a state something like that. There He is; because that is the Christ we have to do with. He is no longer here, no longer in the days of His flesh, He is above and at the right hand of God and the Centre of a whole circle of things.
Ques. Are the things above the vast world of bliss?
C.A.C. Well, it would not be easy to define in a few words the things that are above. If you read the prophetic scriptures of the Old Testament, they do not speak of the things that are above, they connect the thoughts and faith of God's people with things below; that is, the coming kingdom and all that is going to characterise it, the glory of the Lord filling the earth as the waters cover the sea. The great mass of Scripture is occupied with the things below, what God is going to do in a coming day; and in the millennium the people of God will not be occupied with things above but with things below; because, I suppose, some of the things above will be enjoyed below. Not a single person in that day will know what it is to be dead with Christ and risen with Christ -- I mean, of course, on the earthly side -- and no Old Testament saint ever knew it, nor did the disciples when here on earth with Him, because He was not dead and risen then. It defines our position. "Have
{507}
your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth". If He were on earth He would be the object of faith and love, and to be followed in His pathway here. He has died and risen and is at the right hand of God and nowhere else personally.
The Hebrews needed to have that epistle written to them to lead believers to Christ above. They very soon dropped to things below. They said to Paul, 'There are myriads of Jews that have believed and they are all zealous of the law. Let everyone see that you are a good Jew'. They all said wrong and Paul gave way (@Acts 21: 20). That was the state of things a very few years after Pentecost; it is very solemn. Paul had to fall in, or cause a breach between the believers. He could not face that, and he landed himself in prison for the rest of his days. It shows how easy it is to get away from the things above. Peter had said, "Him has God exalted by his right hand as leader and saviour" (@Acts 5: 31). That was occupying them with things above. Later he dropped down to be a good Jew, just what Paul was warning them against here. To recognise that our place here is to be on the ground of the death of Christ clears away a lot of rubbish. We may say we are dead with Him, we may say it in words, but it is no use talking.
I think it is quite possible for people to try to be dead. There is no power with being dead, but in being dead with Christ there is great power.
Ques. Would you say more as to what that means -- dead with Christ?
C.A.C. Well, Christ's place here is the place of death. The world has never reversed its verdict. If we love Him we shall covet to be identified with Him in death in this scene. We shall not want to be anything politically or publicly, we shall not want anything but His rejection here because we are bound up with Him above -- 'One with Thee above', as we sometimes sing.
Rem. "Bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus"
{508}
(@2 Corinthians 4: 10).
C.A.C. That is the real thing. If really identified with Him in death and as risen and exalted we shall come out like Him down here, and that is as fully stated here as anywhere in the Bible. J.B.S. used to tell of a woman in a storm who, when asked what she did, said she was thinking of Jesus in the storm. 'Then you did not come out like Him', was his reply. 'If you had been thinking about Him where He is, you would have come out like Him where He was'. Stephen did so. There is no reference in the epistles as to what Jesus was, except as bearing on the practical life of the saint; and we only come out as He was, as we are occupied with Him where He is; the power is in that.
Rem. "As *he* is, *we* also are in this world" (@1 John 4: 17).
C.A.C. "He that says he abides in him" (@1 John 2: 6) -- that is, as He is; "even as *he* walked" -- that is where He was. I am sure that is so. We find the mass of Christians are taken up with what Jesus was; they read the gospels, not understanding them; therefore there is no power because the Holy Spirit comes in in connection with Jesus being glorified. I have often said, I believe as the writers of the gospels were writing verse by verse they said to themselves, 'Now risen and glorified'. It is not Christ for this world; the Christ of the gospels was. But then He was also rejected and the world cut Him off. He was cut off from the world, and now He is the Centre of another world, and that is the only Christ we know.
Rem. "If even we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we know him thus no longer" (@2 Corinthians 5: 16).
C.A.C. He then goes on just after that to speak of new creation, and that is connected with Christ in heaven, and is the rule of our walk here, the rule of new creation. It is not only Christ there but a system of heavenly things, and that, I believe, constitutes the true power of christianity; and as we concentrate on that we come into what is of God.
{509}
Everything hangs for us on the place where Christ is. Who He is comes first -- "Who art thou, Lord?" was Paul's question. Every one of us has to be brought to ask Him that question. He only can tell us that, and when He has told us, the next thing we shall want to know is, where is He?
The whole of christendom has got on the ground of something on the earth. Why build big cathedrals and churches, unless you want a place on earth? If so, it must be a large one. All these things are a positive denial of christianity. It does not go along with being dead with Christ and risen with Christ; a man who is, is outside of it all. J.B.S. has said that up to the death of Stephen the offers of grace were going out to God's earthly people, but when they were rejected everything was transferred from Jerusalem below to Jerusalem above -- the new metropolis.
Rem. The blind man in @John 9 had simple faith in the Person.
C.A.C. The blind man did not stop until he worshipped the Son of God. He was pushed out. Do we want some place in the things below? We are to earn our living and fill up our little responsibilities here to the glory of God in obedience and subjection to Him, but we can do all that without wanting any place here, and as belonging to our Head in heaven we do not want a place here.
Rem. "Your life is hid with the Christ in God" (verse 3).
C.A.C. Is that not beautiful? Every Christian has a life outside this world, outside things below, and that life is in a Person. "Christ ... who is our life" (verse 4). It is a wonderful moment in the life of a soul when he first realises that. Because it is Christ who is above who is our life. There is infinite, blessed satisfaction if we consider who He is and then where He is, and if the place is seen that we have in relation to Him as His body, which is a wonderful formation down here. It has all come out of Christ in heaven; the body is really a heavenly company. Those living in the world are those who have a life such as it is in
{510}
the world, and what a life it is! What the world is to the worldly, Christ is to the Christian. It puts us in a wonderful light.
Rem. Mary at the feet of Jesus had His death in mind.
C.A.C. Mary, and she alone perhaps, learned the lesson of death and resurrection; there were only two people who expected the Lord to die -- Nicodemus and Mary. She learned Him as the resurrection and the life, which was a wonderful thing. So the gospels present an immense number of things that were not actually true at the time. The Lord had before Him at the very outset that He was going to die, and all His acts of grace and mercy were founded on His death. In fact, not a single act of God in goodness towards men in the Old Testament would have been possible except for that. His death was a blessed, present reality in God's mind though it was yet future. It was all known to God as much before as after.
Rem. There were the water vessels in @John 2.
C.A.C. The water vessels when filled with water to the top represent the purification of death, then it is turned into the wine of joy, and I think that is the moral order always.
Ques. Is "Your life is hid with the Christ in God" (verse 3) a collective or individual thought?
C.A.C. I think these things are all collective -- being dead with Christ, raised with Christ and having Christ as our life, and that is why saints like coming together. What is collective surpasses what is individual always; they have what they can enjoy together, and the greatest bit is for the least.
Ques. Would it be connected with things above?
C.A.C. I think that is right; we come together that we may touch afresh the things above and that blessed Person who is the Centre of them all. "When the Christ is manifested who is our life, then shall *ye* also be manifested with him in glory" (verse 4). When He comes into public view
{511}
the saints all come into public view too, and that is in a glorified condition. It would take our thoughts away from things publicly below. So our life is hid with Christ in heaven. No one can see our life, but they ought to be able to see it coming out. We are to put to death our members which are on the earth, and Christians do all put these things to death; if they do not they could not be said to be Christians. You once "lived in these things" -- what a life! Yet they were things that were our very nature as in the flesh. We are never told to die to them; we are to put them to death in the power of life.
There is more trouble perhaps about the positive things we are to put on. And to put off habits is not easy, "But now, put off ... all these things, wrath, anger, malice", and so on; they are all bad habits that have to be put off, and Christians do put them off. That is simple christianity. It is no good to tell me that a person who habitually tells lies, and an angry person characterised by wrath, is a Christian; no one would believe you. All this is the practical result of having Christ as my life. If He is, I do not want vile language to come out of my mouth. If they have not put off these things, they are not Christians.
Rem. Is not this addressed to the Colossian believers?
C.A.C. There is a shade of difference here to note. He does not tell them to put them off, he exhorts them to be in the state of having done it; they are to be in that state. The word is there to exercise us if we should manifest any of these things. It is always assumed that Christians have put off the old man and have put on the new. "Having put off the old man with his deeds, and having put on the new, renewed into full knowledge according to the image of him that has created him" (verses 9, 10). It has been done; the aorist is used (see footnote a, Darby Translation). And that is christianity. If I have not put off these things I am not a Christian at all. If a Christian does lie, he does not know what to say when he goes to God; he has nothing to say.
{512}
Rem. All liars have their part in the lake of fire (@Revelation 21: 8).
C.A.C. Well, I must not go on with that. I do not want to qualify for the lake of fire, do I?
{513}
NOTES OF A READING @COLOSSIANS 4: 1 - 18
Rem. "Persevere in prayer, watching in it with thanksgiving". I suppose there should be along with prayer the responsible side -- the thought of thanksgiving, for we can hardly approach God at all without thanksgiving in our hearts; it connects with our very approach to God, apart from the petition we offer.
Would it be like incense added to the prayers, the spirit of intercession blending with thanksgiving? They must take on something of incense character which is pleasing to God.
C.A.C. I suppose all true prayer is bringing back to God His own thoughts, and that must produce in the heart that takes it up the spirit of thanksgiving.
Rem. "For he that draws near to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them who seek him out" (@Hebrews 11: 6).
Rem. I remember an old saint saying the believer has such a sense of God and His love that he can give thanks all the time. It is like a person in some difficulty going to a friend he knows is perfectly able to meet it all. You pour out your difficulty, and give thanks in the same breath, as it were.
Ques. David said, "Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense, the lifting up of my hands as the evening oblation" (@Psalm 141: 2). What would it mean, "Watching in it" (verse 2)? Is it that we are on the line of securing the answer?
C.A.C. Well, prayer is not much good if we do not look out for the answer.
Ques. "That God may open to us a door of the word to speak the mystery of Christ". Does that refer to a door being opened in the hearts of saints to the ministry, do you
{514}
suppose?
C.A.C. I do not know that the apostle ever prayed that he might be furnished with more to minister, did he? I do not think he prayed for more light, or increased knowledge of what was connected with Christ. But the exercise was that he might be able to speak of it rightly. He had it, it was all in his soul by the grace of God, but there was an exercise remaining that there might be a door for the word, that the word might go forth in actual communication to souls.
Rem. It is a question of a door opened for them to receive.
C.A.C. And of his own capacity to put it out; "That I may make it manifest as I ought to speak". It is important that the Lord's servants should be helped to put out what they have got. The Lord gives spiritual substance to His servants, but they need divine help to put it out. The speaking is an important matter, for they may in some way obscure what they want to say.
Ques. What is "the mystery of Christ" (verse 3)?
C.A.C. Well, I think it would include all that is connected with Christ where He is as hidden from the eyes of men. There is a wonderful wealth connected with Christ in the hidden position, and it is to be made known in the ministry of the word, and those who do minister need much help. That I might speak "as I ought to speak", the apostle says. There is a right way to speak.
Ques. Why do you say 'hidden'?
C.A.C. Because that is the mystery of the Christ; it is just because He is hidden from human eyes that there is such a thing. It is all behind the scenes. Everything at the right hand of God, everything having that character, is hidden, is in mystery. Of course, the mystery would include the fact that He has a body here.
Rem. "The Preacher was wise, ... he pondered, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs. The Preacher
{515}
sought to find out acceptable words; and that which was written is upright, words of truth" (@Ecclesiastes 12: 9, 10). It shows the concern of the preacher to speak as he ought to speak.
Rem. "He so spake that a great multitude of both Jews and Greeks believed" (@Acts 14: 1).
C.A.C. The character of the speaking is important.
Rem. "If any one speak -- as oracles of God; if any one minister-as of strength which God supplies" (@1 Peter 4: 11).
C.A.C. And we need continually to pray for that. It is a continual exercise, the waiting on the Lord of those that speak, for something to say; but they ought to be supported by the saints as to the actual putting of it out.
Rem. There are the both sides, speaking and receiving.
C.A.C. Both sides would be needed that there should be "a door of the word". It hardly could be said if it were all on the speaker's side.
Rem. It is an important principle that a servant should be prayed for as to his utterance, but there should be an earnest desire on the part of the saints that they should be able to receive.
Rem. It is important for us to see the setting here, that it is a question of how the teaching becomes effectual. All the preceding chapters are full of the greatness of Christ; how much have we gathered up about it? It must be an encouragement to feel that there is far more to be dispensed than we have already gathered up.
Rem. The question is, do we desire to receive it and be affected by it?
Ques. Why does the apostle say, "Remember my bonds" (verse 18)?
Ques. Is not the precious ministry the very reason why he has been brought into bonds?
Rem. It is more a matter of the greatness of the thing.
Ques. The prison epistles give us the greatest things, do they not?
{516}
C.A.C. Yes, and it should touch our hearts that Paul was prepared to suffer so much that this precious truth should come to us.
Rem. He was held in a certain course in order that this might come out; so he speaks of himself as a prisoner of Jesus Christ; he might not move in other directions.
C.A.C. And he passes on the responsibility to us all in the next two verses, because there it is a question of those that are without, "so as to know how ye ought to answer each one" (verse 6).
Rem. This would seem to follow on. What is inward must be first, before it can take shape outwardly towards others. If we enter the fray unequipped we may be worsted.
Rem. You first get built up, and then you are able.
C.A.C. And "in wisdom" (verse 5), it says. Opportunities come to all of us, and we are not to miss those, but then we need wisdom. It is quite easy to say something that might hinder what we desire.
Rem. To cry down what a person holds and so create an atmosphere of distrust and opposition at once is not wisdom. You put what is attractive before children if you want to encourage them.
C.A.C. And we ought to cultivate the ability to put ourselves alongside of people.
Rem. "To all I have become all things, in order that at all events I might save some" (@1 Corinthians 9: 22). The apostle puts himself as near as possible to those to whom he spoke.
Rem. The Lord put Himself near to the woman of Samaria.
C.A.C. He did in a wonderful way, if you think of what He was and what she was -- to ask a drink of a degraded woman hardly fit to be seen at large. He made Himself dependent on her; that is the spirit in which to reach people.
I think the need for wisdom comes out in contact with individual souls more than anything else. It is easy to stand
{517}
up and speak with no one to contradict you, but with individual souls you have to be prepared for things you did not expect.
Rem. There is even a righteous condemnation that may be a hindrance. People may have been brought up in a thing, or they may have known the truth and become entangled. It is a test of our resources, whether we have a treasure-house. The more we listen to Paul the better we shall be able to meet the case, to present what is attractive. There is nothing so attractive as Christ. The question is whether we have the ability to present it.
Rem. "The wise winneth souls" (@Proverbs 11: 30), or, as footnote a says (Darby Translation), 'He that winneth souls is wise'.
Rem. "Let your word be always with grace, seasoned with salt" (verse 6) is a very good word for us generally.
Rem. Salt is a preservative; the Lord was full of grace and truth.
C.A.C. Yes, and the principle of faithfulness is there; you do not exactly hide your principles.
Rem. You must take care that grace does not carry you right down into the mud; there must be balance with us.
C.A.C. The Lord has been referred to in @John 4. Well, what He said to the woman was pure grace, but He had to bring in the seasoning of the salt. The moment came when He had to say, "Go, call thy husband" (verse 16); the salt came in. We ought never to speak to anybody in an ungracious way, however wicked they are.
Ques. How do you mean that? It says "Thy money go with thee to destruction" (@Acts 8: 20).
C.A.C. Well, that was a solemn sentence of judgment pronounced upon Simon, which has not been put into our charge. God has not given us authority to pronounce judgment on anybody.
Ques. And is not grace the great characteristic of the
{518}
present dispensation? "Let your word be always with grace". I think what you were saying is very important.
C.A.C. Even if we have to speak in severity it should always be in grace, so that it is manifest we are not speaking in any ill-feeling or with enmity.
Rem. "How ye ought to answer each one" (verse 6). Christianity is a matter of persons.
C.A.C. Sometimes it is the greatest wisdom not to say anything. We are not responsible to answer every foolish question that may be put to us. We are under responsibility to give a reason to everyone that asks an account of the hope that is in us -- we are responsible to answer every question on that line. Infidel questions, because they are infidel, need wisdom.
It is important to see that Tychicus was sent to them to make known to them all particulars as to the apostle's state and circumstances. That is, there was one man in prison in whom things were exemplified in grace and wisdom. It pleased God to bring out christianity in Paul, so that there was not only a letter written but a brother to tell them all that concerned Paul. Christianity is a living thing, it cannot be put in a letter. They were to be told the conduct and spirit of Paul in his condition of bonds and humiliation. All that was a reality to Paul was to be reported; so they had a wonderful report as to what sort of man Paul was. Christianity was coming out in him, and it comes out in persons. It is important for us to see that the Bible without the saints is no good.
Rem. It has been said the Bible cannot love you.
C.A.C. In the Bible you get the letter of the truth, but the substance of the truth is in the saints; christianity is a divine system of blessing in persons. It was all livingly set forth in Christ, and now is set forth in the body. So we are very important. It is not a question of what we hold, but of what holds us. Each one is essential in the service, for if Christ does not come out in me, I am out of the whole
{519}
thing.
The state of Paul was to be communicated to them and their state communicated to him. Tychicus was to bring back word as to what effect the letter had had on them; and that is what the Lord looks for, that the Scripture should have its effect on us, otherwise we might as well not have had it brought before us.
Ques. Why was Onesimus sent?
C.A.C. Because it was his letter of commendation! He had been a runaway slave and was going back now. "Who is one of you" (verse 9), he says, he is local at Colosse. The epistle to Philemon went along with the epistle to Colosse, I suppose, but that was a personal, private letter to Philemon. "The faithful and beloved brother" (verse 9): he is one of you, he will fit in all right.
Rem. It would be a living element strengthening the assembly setting at Colosse.
C.A.C. Yes.
Rem. In Philemon, Archippus is also mentioned (verse 12), as well as at the end of this epistle.
C.A.C. The bringing in of persons at the end of certain epistles is important as indicating that the thing has been made good in certain persons. The Colossians had not only a beautiful letter, but there were certain persons in which these things could be seen livingly. And we all have this opportunity, and indeed there is an obligation upon us to express Christ, and it is the living expression of Christ that is of pleasure to God. The body of Christ exists for the very purpose of expressing Christ. The mention of persons shows it is a very practical thing. It is touching to see that Mark is now restored to the affection of the apostle. It is very pathetic, too, that Paul has to say, 'These are the only ones that have been a comfort to me'. "These are the only fellow-workers for the kingdom of God who have been a consolation to me" (verse 11).
Rem. I believe Epaphras is the only one spoken of as
{520}
"the bondman of Christ Jesus" (verse 12).
C.A.C. And he was working it out on his knees, we might say.
Rem. Why does he say to Archippus, "Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, to the end that thou fulfil it" (verse 17)?
C.A.C. I should think there must have been with him a tendency to be a little slack. It is important that what the Lord has given should be worked out for the good of the saints. There is one Lord and there are distinctions of services. The Lord appoints the service of each one, who is under the responsibility to work it out -- to fulfil it.
