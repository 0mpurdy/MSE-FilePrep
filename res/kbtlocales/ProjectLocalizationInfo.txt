# InstallAnywhere Localization Information and Mapping File
#
# This file provides information for the mappings of localization properties
#     to the action for which the localization is provided.  This file is meant
#     to be used in conjunction with the custom_xx files found in the same
#     directory.
#
# Notes on the conventions used in this file:
#     '+--'  denotes a data object that belongs to another given object (it
#            defines some portion of the properties of its owner object).  This
#            data object possesses one or more properties that are localizable
#     '|--'  denotes a parent-child relationship between two objects (typically,
#            this relationship is represented visually as a hierarchy or nesting
#            in the Install task of InstallAnywhere's Advanced Designer)
#     'NoEP' denotes an object that exists in the tree, but does not possess any
#            externalizable/localizable properties
#
#     The relationships described above can be used to help identify the correct
#     property to configure an object when working with the custom_xx files.
