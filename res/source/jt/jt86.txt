WHAT THE SAINTS ARE TO GOD
@Ephesians 1:17,18; @Exodus 19:5,6; @Isaiah 43:1,6,7; @2 Chronicles 5:11 - 14
J.T. The passage in Ephesians is generally known to us; it brings before us, perhaps more strikingly than any other, what the saints are to God. We are to know this; it is the subject of the apostle's prayer that we may know this; it is founded on a certain state already there, as he says, "Having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is in you, and the love which ye have towards all the saints, do not cease giving thanks for you, making mention of you at my prayers, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, would give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him, being enlightened in the eyes of your heart, so that ye should know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints". @Ephesians 1:15 - 18. The Lord being here, seen as the Father's glory, we have glory in its greatest features and a rich expression, the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints. With this verse in our minds, we may be helped in looking at the Old Testament to see the history of this great subject. The verses read are only representative, for there are many others bearing on the same subject, but @Exodus 19 gives us the beginning as regards the position in us. Of course we have to begin with counsel, and God reaching His counsels from His own side, but what is in mind now is to show how the saints are seen practically, that is through creation and through formation, two words used in this
{2}
subject. The first thought is obedience; in a way that enters into assembly service as we had it here this morning, what the saints are, and how the saints come before us as God's inheritance; it is not what we are merely according to counsel, but what we are as created and formed. The passage in 2 Chronicles brings the history of it before us, indicative of God's inheritance, what He found in Israel typically, what He finds in us as seen in Ephesians. The glory filling the house would mean that the whole scene, according to what is presented through the priests¬ services, is delightful to God. It is His inheritance, what He has had in mind all the time in counsel and now has reached. So that the first thought to be considered is obedience. It speaks of God having brought them to Himself on eagles¬ wings, but now "If ye will hearken to my voice indeed and keep my covenant, then shall ye be my own possession out of all the peoples -- for all the earth is mine -- and ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation".
F.W. Would you help us as to being made and formed? You used, I think, those two words in contrast to what we are in counsel.
J.T. I was speaking of the passage from the prophet, as you have no doubt observed @Isaiah 43:1, "But now thus saith Jehovah, that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel: Fear not, for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine". And so verse 7, "Every one that is called by my name, and whom I have created for my glory: I have formed him, yea, I have made him". A distinction is carried down from the first and second chapters of Genesis; the first speaks of man being created, the second speaks of man being formed or made, which is more the personal operation of God. He was to be in the image of God as created, but then the formation would be more
{3}
detail, skill, in the features that He had in mind. It was Christ really, Adam was but a figure of Him that was to come, and we are to be conformed to the image of God's Son.
F.W. Is that dependent on obedience?
J.T. I thought obedience was the basis of all this. Aside from obedience what can God do with us? We have to be subdued, so that it is conditional here, "If ye will hearken to my voice indeed and keep my covenant, then shall ye be my own possession out of all the peoples -- for all the earth is mine -- and ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation". The bearing of it would be more public, a kingdom of priests, a holy nation, but it is a question of obedience, hearkening to His voice and keeping His covenant, which has a great bearing today on the saints. What are we, although we may speak of having been converted at a certain time, save as we come under the divine touch and there is formation?
A.F.M. It is as we are subject in His hand we come in for the formation.
J.T. I think that is the way it is. The creation is a sort of basic thought in @Genesis 1 involving material. God takes up man as such and forms him, according to @Genesis 2, and enters into covenant with him; so that it corresponds here now; we have a moral being, not simply a creation, but God breathed into man's nostrils and he became a living soul on that principle, which meant that he was not only created, but made a moral being that God could act upon, the moral being meaning that there is that in us that God can affect on moral lines; that was stressed in @Exodus 19.
-.U. How far does creation carry us?
J.T. Well, it remains with us. "Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth" @Ecclesiastes 12:1; that runs through, you never lose it, nor shall we in
{4}
eternity lose the thought of being creatures. The two thoughts run together, creation and generation; I think generation is greater, and the idea of formation, at least in Adam, comes in on that line. God can act, whether through his intelligence, his affections, or his conscience, whatever it be in him.
Ques. You are not looking at it simply as a creature from the hand of a Creator?
J.T. He is that -- God created the heavens and the earth. Then on the fifth day, as regards the fishes, it says, "God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living souls, and let fowl fly above the earth in the expanse of the heavens. And God created the great sea monsters". @Genesis 1:20,21. That is the next use of the word 'created' in the history till you come to man -- it is the same word for all, the same word for the great general act of God in creating the heavens and the earth.
Ques. Do you carry it on to the new creation in regard to the saints?
J.T. Quite so, it is carried through. But @Genesis 1 helps us; there is nothing said there as to angels; we know they were creatures, of course, but there is very little said about them. It is what is before our eyes that is in mind, and man is created as the great sea monsters were and as the heavens and the earth were: all came under the same word, something made out of nothing, as far as we can see. But when you come to formation, it is not that, the material is there; creation brings the material in, so it is a question of God's skill in making something for Himself peculiarly that He can love and persons that love Him and form His inheritance.
-.B. Does @Psalm 139 bear on the thought? "My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them". @Psalm 139:15,16.
{5}
J.T. Well, that is a good scripture to bring forward now, no doubt it is a hidden allusion to the assembly. @Ezekiel 16 helps also -- the beautiful description God gives of Jerusalem. It shows what is in mind in the sense of formation and fashioning; love enters into it. The creation is a great general thought, but, when you come to man, formation implies a being God would have intercourse with, who would reciprocate in his intelligence and his affections too; and of course Jacob comes in for that side.
Eu.R. Does 'voice' in this first scripture in the Old Testament help in relation to that? Does it involve an intimate link between God and His people, this hearkening to His voice?
J.T. A thought that begins in the garden -- Adam heard the voice.
Eu.R. I wondered if we could connect it in any way with the Lord Jesus in Luke's gospel, His genealogy is traced up to Adam and then to God; whether we could link it with "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God", @Luke 4:4 and then what is said in Romans, "So also by the obedience of the one" @Romans 5:19 -- would that enter into it?
J.T. Quite so. Luke gives us the moral side, the link between God and man.
A.F.M. In the formation we read of in Genesis is Christ before God supremely as the great Model?
J.T. That is what is said; Adam is "the figure of him to come". @Romans 5:14. So that God had Christ in His mind; in that way Adam was a figure of what that Man was to be, it is what Christ is really, and our being conformed to Him in the most exalted way: that we might be "conformed to the image of his Son, so that he should be the firstborn among many brethren". @Romans 8:29.
{6}
C.G. Peter, in quoting this passage in Exodus, speaks of disobedience. Is your thought that the first evidence of God's work coming to light is the thought of obedience?
J.T. I think that is the evidence of the moral element that man is responding to God. "We thus judge", says the apostle, "that if one died for all, then were all dead" (or "then all have died"). @2 Corinthians 5:14. That is, there is no pulsation in man Godward, hence the necessity for Christ to die to bring out another order of man. We have thus judged; but the death of Christ meant there was no pulsation in man at all towards God: "One died for all, then all have died; and he died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who died for them and has been raised. So that *we* henceforth know no one according to flesh; but if even we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we know him thus no longer. So if anyone be in Christ, there is a new creation". @2 Corinthians 5:14 - 17. All is dead if Christ had to die; it was imperative; we judge that way. So that God has to begin over again with Christ. Peter says we are sanctified to the obedience of Jesus Christ.
W.H.U. Is the formation you speak of on new creation lines that we recognise there is a new creation and are formed according to that, so that we lose the Jacob character and come out as Israel?
J.T. Yes, it is on family lines now. New creation itself is not a heritage for it extends to inanimate things, though God rejoices in what He creates, He says He will rejoice over Jerusalem with joy. We ought to get on to the generative line, for it is a question of the family, and ultimately of our being conformed to the image of God's Son, and the passage in Isaiah, I think, helps. We have the two thoughts, creation and formation.
Eu.R. Is this principle of obedience essential to us if we are to touch our privilege? The apostle says,
{7}
"When your obedience is fulfilled", @2 Corinthians 10:6. Then in Philippians, "As ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence" @Philippians 2:12. Does that help?
J.T. Yes, indeed it does. So here I think in @Exodus 19 there was a very infantile condition; they were brought by Moses and brought by Jehovah; they are not yet walking. "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God" @Romans 8:14 alludes to @Numbers 21; it took a good time to get to that, but still they are brought by authority and divine influence to Sinai, and the movement is henceforward by the glory in the tabernacle. But in @Numbers 21 it is persons who are no longer governed by their own thoughts or by an objective idea, but by the Spirit and by what is in themselves; they are constituted sons because they are led by the Spirit. Now @Exodus 24 advances on the infantile or babe state. They had to be carried like the eagle; all has to be done for the young, although the instincts are there. In Deuteronomy this figure is brought in, but it is an infantile state of things, and God cares thus for a young believer as he comes out of the world; he is borne with more than he is afterwards. But now Moses puts up twelve pillars; that does not mean a babe, that does not mean the saints are being cared for now as babes; it means men. Israel is to be composed of men able to do things in relation to one another, able to work in love together; for that is what is in the mind of Moses. So now he says there are young men in the priestly service, as much as to say, there is a little bit of growth. That shows the line on which God is coming into His inheritance; it is not in babes, not that He does not love the saints as babes, but He is thinking of men; so Corinthians stresses, "Quit you like men". @1 Corinthians 16:13.
Ques. Do you suggest formation?
{8}
J.T. Quite so; there is some formation in the young man, not only physically, but morally. I believe the Lord is continually keeping before us all these things in relation to assembly service, for that is the thought in His mind just now. The great thing is to get them fitted into our minds, and then we can sit down together. The Corinthians were babes, hence they did not know how to behave themselves in the assembly; they behaved naughtily, as it were playing with toys, like little children. So Moses uses young men, and the thing is done well.
Ques. Is Paul seeking right formation when he says, "I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you", @Galatians 4:19?
J.T. Quite so. They were legal and he wanted to set them free in sonship. The thought is that Christ should be fixedly in our souls as sons.
W.H.U. Would there be any connection between the pillars and the young men who went to sacrifice?
J.T. I think it is to show the progress made, so they are able to serve God in offering sacrifices.
Eu.R. We are intended to grow our own wings in time; it says, "They shall mount up with wings as eagles". @Isaiah 40:31.
J.T. Quite so.
J.C.T. "Until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God", @Ephesians 4:13 is that in mind in the twelve pillars?
J.T. Quite so. They are doing things themselves and doing them well, for they are marked by obedience. All this leads up to David and Solomon. What were you going to say?
F.W. I was only going to remark that this initially broke down through disobedience, but God starts to build the thing up again on the basis of obedience, both here and with us. We have much addressed to us as to the service of God, but are we obedient?
{9}
Eu.R. It says, "If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land". @Isaiah 1:19
J.T. Yes. As we have said, they took possession of the land, according to @Joshua 8. @Deuteronomy 33 required that they should have done that as soon as they went in, but it was deferred. But now they surround the ark and offer burnt offerings and peace offerings. We want to follow up the thread of obedience and progress involving formation, young men and then men. "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God"; @Romans 8:14 that comes in in Numbers. They are now going into the land and there is a new priesthood, and presently a new leader, Joshua. Joshua was there all the time and Eleazar too, but now Moses and Aaron are to give place to them.
Eu.R. And that is because this obedience and formation had come in.
J.T. That is it. With Moses and Aaron the point is obedience. Romans gives subjection and priesthood. The subject person is developed into a priest, so that he presents his body. Then you go on till you come to the riches of His inheritance in the saints.
Eu.R. Had you anything more in your mind as to Isaiah?
J.T. These bits are like our ministry meetings. Someone stands up and brings out one thought, then someone else brings out another, and we cannot at first perhaps see the connection. But how beautiful this is, "Fear not, for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine".
Eu.R. Why does he say in verse 1, "I have called thee by thy name", and in verse 7, "Every one that is called by my name"?
J.T. Well, that would mean that each of us has taken on that, giving us a peculiar place with God.
{10}
As it is said to Philadelphia, "Thou ... hast not denied my name". @Revelation 3:8.
W.B. Does formation take place primarily in our local settings?
J.T. That is the next thing to get hold of. "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God". @Romans 8:14. Numbers shows that after the brazen serpent, the condemnation of sin in the flesh, Israel goes forward itself without any mention of the tabernacle; it is the Spirit now, they are men now moving of themselves.
Rem. So that, in coming into the meeting, the Spirit has His place with us.
J.T. Yes, it is the Lord's matter as we sit down together each in his place; that is the first thing. Then who takes part? Well, someone does freshly, and it is a young man, perhaps; but then we can proceed, and "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God". @Romans 8:14. The tabernacle is in view in the Lord's supper, it begins in Exodus; Exodus is the given type, I think, of the Lord's supper. Then you think how beautiful the saints are; they are God's blest people. The Lord said, "Blessed are your eyes", @Matthew 13:16 your very eyes, and all your organs.
Eu.R. In the saints being beautiful under God's eye there is a readiness for the headship of Christ.
J.T. Yes, but you can see how God would turn your thoughts to the brethren. You say, Christ is everything; of course, but it is in the new man that Christ is everything in Colossians. The new man is "renewed into full knowledge according to the image of him that has created him" @Colossians 3:10 -- that is, he is like Christ, Christ is everything there now, but then do not forget the new man.
Eu.R. The saints in that character.
J.T. Yes.
Ques. Would that be seen in the saints being justified and glorified?
{11}
J.T. Quite so, the apostle goes back to predestination.
Rem. In @Isaiah 44 it says, "I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground; I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring. And they shall spring up among the grass, as willows by the watercourses. One shall say, I am Jehovah's; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall write with his hand: I am Jehovah's, and surname himself by the name of Israel" @Isaiah 44:3 - 5. The surname would imply the family name.
J.T. Yes, he will subscribe himself by the name of Israel; he comes to the spiritual family as formed. So we can see, I think, how Balaam is used; God wants to bring out what He sees in the saints.
Eu.R. So it is very serious for me to say anything against them.
J.T. Hence the unmitigated judgment against Balaam, for he tried to corrupt them. The idea was, I cannot say anything against them, but I will try to corrupt them.
J.C.T. Mr. Darby puts a note to the word 'surname' which implies fondness of affection.
J.T. That is very appealing; it ought to appeal to young people.
Ques. Should we begin the morning meeting with the thought, we being many are one loaf, before we go on?
J.T. Well, that comes in in the early part; it is really mentioned in regard of the fellowship. It comes in in the early part because of the bread or loaf involving subjection, but now we are coming to sonship, "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God" @Romans 8:14 -- that is @Numbers 21. God gives Balaam a view of them, and they are all perfect, there is finality in God's mind, the point reached in the condition of sonship. Then the next
{12}
thing, in a general way, is they are numbered for the inheritance. Balaam's corruption is dealt with in chapter 25; then the daughters of Zelophehad get their inheritance, and God says, I will number you, so that you all know you are to be there. But then Deuteronomy comes in, which is something like headship; it is Moses speaking of himself, and it is called another covenant, beside the one God made with them in Horeb. It is a double thing, to give us sure ground in going into the land, that we may go in in certainty of soul. And then Moses ends with blessing the people, as already remarked. It is a question now of what God is to have, and every true servant of God is looking at the saints as to what they are to God, how he can make them better for God. Joshua and Eleazar both refer to the spiritual help we get so that we are in the land in our intelligence; and then of course we go on to David and Solomon. We get the great end in the passage we read in 2 Chronicles; there we get the beautiful thought of God's glory taking charge of the whole position, typically what the saints are to Him, not only as subject and as sons, but in the way they serve, the beautiful unity in the service, the perfect unison before God. That is my primary thought in all this.
Eu.R. Would there be a similar touch when the tribes came to David at Hebron and anointed him king and David made a covenant with them; would that be Christ giving us firm relations with Himself in view of a world out of death? They recognise they are of him, and then he makes a covenant with them.
J.T. I think that is where formation applies; it is under David and Solomon, I think, that the thought is seen. Solomon is just a counterpart of David. I have no doubt that is where formation is seen in its fulness in the tribes. There was formation in the
{13}
wilderness in sonship, but under headship, which David represents, there is a double thought of it in the twenty-four courses; the thought is intensified.
Eu.R. Does it imply that the tribes are so unified they can become, nationalised all under one man?
J.T. Yes, all under one man; all in keeping with that great thought, the man of God's choice.
A.F.M. David, in that section, rises up as head and addresses God as Head in view of all this being united in one expression.
J.T. It was all one thought in @1 Chronicles 29; the nation is formed according to divine thoughts @1 Chronicles 29:20 - 22. There is perfect unity nationally from the Head down; there is the immensity and richness of the offerings, then there is the unison in song.
-.B. Will you say a word as to verses 11 to 14 of @2 Chronicles 5? "And it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place (for all the priests that were present were hallowed without observing the courses; and the Levites the singers, all they of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, clad in byssus, with cymbals and lutes and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets), -- it came to pass when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one voice to be heard in praising and thanking Jehovah; and when they lifted up their voice with trumpets, and cymbals, and instruments of music, and praised Jehovah: For he is good, for his loving-kindness endureth for ever; that then the house, the house of Jehovah, was filled with a cloud, and the priests could not stand to do their service because of the cloud; for the glory of Jehovah had filled the house of God".
J.T. A wonderful scene. And that parenthesis is to show that any discrepancy there may have been does not interfere with the great general thought.
{14}
-.S. Is that a point we should reach in the morning meeting if we were right?
J.T. That is just the point, the beautiful unison of sound.
-.B. How would that work out locally when it says, "the priests could not stand to do their service because of the cloud"?
J.T. I think it means that the official side ceases; we reach what we shall have eternally in heaven. It does not mean the persons were not recognised, but that the official side ceases as we merge now into the primary thoughts of God, which would be our eternal position; we shall not serve as priests, but as sons.
-.B. Would the thought of silence come in fittingly, the silence of power?
J.T. Just so, if we have power to abstract ourselves even for half a minute. It is a question of power in our souls to do that.
Eu.R. You said something about the service standing related to the glory in a peculiar way.
J.T. Quite so. The whole position refers to the quality and dignity of the saints. That is what is meant. The official side is protected, but it is no longer needed. There is such power now that, however short it may be, there is the sense that we are with God according to His eternal purpose as sons before Him.
J.C.T. Is there a difference between this thought of formation and the thought of transformation in @2 Corinthians 3?
J.T. That would enter into it, of course; that comes into assembly service -- as we behold the glory we are to be transformed. It is a real change inwardly, not a mere external change.
A.F.M. Does the glory filling the house mean sons exactly responding to God and expressing Him?
{15}
It says the glory filled the house of God. Is glory the expression of God?
J.T. Yes, but it is as filling us: we are capable of being filled. The woods in the temple and the other furniture all refer to the saints, to ourselves as formed of God and set in that magnificence, so that there is room for the glory in our hearts.
Eu.R. Would it be right to say that it is a new creation scene and the sons are at home in it and the glory is filling it?
J.T. Well, it is a "better and more perfect tabernacle not made with hand, (that is, not of this creation)", @Hebrews 9:11.
{16}
WORKING WITH GOD
@John 5:17 - 21; @1 Corinthians 3:9 (first clause); @1 Samuel 14:45
I have in mind to speak about working with God. Service is useless, or worse, unless we have this in mind; the Lord says, "He that gathereth not with me scattereth". @Matthew 12:30, @Luke 11:23. This very remarkable passage in @John 5 brings out what is in mind, for we have to learn everything from Christ. If it be a question of grace and acceptableness in our service we have to learn from Him as Son. All dignity and glory in operations stand in that connection, so that with God it is not simply that things are done, but done well, and done with adornment and glory. So the Lord here begins answering His own; having done one work, of which He speaks, He says, "My Father worketh hitherto", and then He adds, "and I work". They were working together. No more glorious thought as to operations can come into our minds than operations jointly by the Father and the Son. This brings out, dear brethren, that we should not only learn, but admire. It is a good acquisition -- the ability to admire what is transcendently beyond us, or even what is on our level. So in the divine operations as presented to us; indeed, as Jehovah Himself describes them to Job, and requires of Job to answer Him. "Gird up now thy loins like a man", @Job 38:3, @Job 40:7. God says. It is worth noticing, for if we are less than a man we scarcely admire what is beyond us; we are apt to be jealous of others. So that we see in a man like Peter admiration and praise for a fellow-worker with God: it is expressed in his remark, "Our beloved brother Paul", @2 Peter 3:15 he acknowledging Paul's writings as on the very highest level, as Scripture, and according to the Lord's thought they would work together as one. So Jehovah says to Job, "Gird up now thy loins like a man", @Job 38:3, @Job 40:7.
{17}
for although he might find speeches to overcome his critics, his so-called friends, he was really speaking like a babe, like a Corinthian: they were babes in Christ, but still babes. God, in speaking to a man like that, would raise him to a higher level; He would speak to him as a man, and therefore would have him answer as a man. Jehovah says, "Where wast thou when I founded the earth?". @Job 38:3. Job would have to say, 'Well, that is enough, I have no status on that line'. Jehovah says, "when the morning stars sang together". @Job 38:7. It was a living state of things there when God began to operate, "and all the sons of God shouted for joy" -- not one exempt. It was a jubilant state of things. It pleased God, and He did not forget it -- it rejoiced His heart as His creatures were created. Their creation is not recorded in @Genesis 1, but they were there before the earth evidently, as if God would have sympathetic creatures in His great undertakings, in the sphere in which love would show itself, even on this very earth where we are. There were a great many sons of God, according to Revelation, and are still. So we have a clue as to the work of God, and if angels are to join in, they are to understand and join in sympathetically. But they, like ourselves, would see the complete thought in Christ. That must be so for He is the Firstborn of all creation, Lord of angels, and so on. So He is before all things, coming in later historically, but He has precedence morally of everything and every person, save God Himself, of course.
So one should admire a workman. John the baptist said of Him, "He ... is preferred before me, for he was before me", @John 1:15 that is as to His Person. No one can be with God who has a doubt as to the personality and deity of Jesus. There is to be no tolerance at all of any difference of thought as to
{18}
that, nor can there be any sympathy with God as long as there is a doubt as to the personality of Jesus. He is before all things; that is what Colossians would teach us. If we are to operate we are to learn from Christ, not angels, for He, though coming in later in manhood, was before all; and hence throughout Scripture, in this manner, we have the father and son, not only father. That is the supreme thought in relation to that which answers to the mind and affections of God; it is in connection with the Father and the Son. You do not get the full glory of a father without the son, or the full glory of a son without the father. "The Word became flesh, and dwelt [or tabernacled] among us (and we have contemplated his glory ... )". @John 1:14. That is the idea to get into our souls. So we get the thought in Abraham and Isaac: how beautiful is the thought as they move to the mount of Moriah; they had a conversation between them, reciprocal exchange of words. Then in Jacob and Joseph -- father and son; the father loved the son, for Jacob loved Joseph. It is in the radiation of the light that the spiritual charm is seen. "We have contemplated his glory", John the evangelist says, "a glory as of an only-begotten with a father, full of grace and truth". @John 1:14. So that we get Jacob and Joseph. Joseph was not always equal to the position; great man though he was, he was not equal to the position in @Genesis 48, when he said, "Not so, my father". @Genesis 48:18. That is not the glory of sonship. That is what Joseph said, but Jacob, as it will be seen, is right, but still he blesses Joseph as a son. Then we get David and Solomon, beautiful representation anticipatively of the Father and Son, David rising at the end of his life to the full thought of father and son, as I might say. He honours Solomon and places him on the throne beside him. What a picture if we can discern; it is for us to see it, to be charmed with the beautiful
{19}
pictures of Scripture of the coming in of this wonderful relation between divine Persons so that they are working together. Solomon was a young man, but David is handing over to him a wonderful matter, administrative, structural, and there is no discrepancy as far as Scripture presents. The father and son are there, royalty in the father and the son; every presentation has its own particular glory; it is one glory after another in which the Son Himself appears.
So the Lord says, "My Father worketh hitherto and I work", the announcement of a great fact, that God was His Father; the Jews did not like that. We have to be on our guard about the Jews, hence, at the time of the great announcement of our being introduced into the circle of the Father and the Son (@John 20) the disciples shut the doors against the Jews. These legal elements spoil the whole matter. Paul says we are working with God, and that is what is needed. If we take the history of christendom it is not that; it began with that, with men of like passions as ourselves. The Lord would show in these wonderful men the handiwork of the past, what workmanship is, and we must grasp the divine mind, what the Father and the Son are really going on with. I have no doubt that the allusion in John to the glory of the Son, the glory of an only-begotten with a father, full of grace and truth, alludes to the matter on hand, namely, the work of God. Full of grace and truth -- these are the great requisites if we are to work with God, as we have in the twelve apostles and Paul. John shows us the Persons in their holy relations into which they have come: Luke also does, but enlarges on this matter of grace and truth. Grace first. No one can work with God unless he has grace in his soul. "By grace ye are saved". @Ephesians 2:8. The conditions here in which we are to operate require the supply of grace, then truth. They
{20}
are not to be reversed; it is grace and truth, so that they subsist in Jesus Christ; they are there. He is now full of what is requisite; they must be there, namely grace and truth. So that the apostle Paul, in saying that he and Silvanus were fellow-labourers with God, meant that they were furnished in this way. If a man presents himself for employment with God he must have requisites. Matthew in chapter 20 presents men coming in early in the day; they bargained with the householder and he took them on, but they were not the kind he wanted. God does not want those who make a bargain with Him or ask for a salary. That feature does not belong to the work of God. He is a wonderful Employer, I speak reverently, but He has His own requirements, and Paul says, we are amongst His workmen. Let no one think he can do as he wishes, as if God has nothing to say to him. Working with an archbishop is not working with God; there may be christians doing this, but the point is are you working with God. God has work to be done, and Paul says, I am amongst those workers; God made him that; so he says in the next epistle, "Giving no manner of offence in anything, that the ministry be not blamed". @2 Corinthians 6:3. He would not do anything which would discredit the position but "commending ourselves as God's ministers". @2 Corinthians 6:4. We learn all this from Jesus. The Lord worked in humility, as the Father works (@John 5:19).
You can see, dear brethren, the level on which these operations are going on. What the Father does the Son does, and what the Father does He shows the Son. One takes off one's shoes, as it were, when one thinks of a divine Person speaking in this way. It is a question of what the Father does, and the Son works in line with the Father. He does nothing of Himself. The lowliness of Jesus is food for our souls; and yet in the same text there is the assertion
{21}
of the equality with the Father -- the Son with the Father. There is no danger of any doubt as to the personality of the Lord Jesus, but we learn how things are to be done. The apostle Paul understood that it was a matter of Father and Son; it is the dispensation of grace, that is, Father and Son, and all workmanship must be in that connection, otherwise we are not working with God.
In 1 Samuel we see how a son worked, but not with his father. Jonathan undertakes the work, and he tells not his father. There are many different religious authorities, and the word 'father' has a great place in these bodies. The authority of these so-called fathers is asserted in those circles. The leading personalities are called fathers, even holy fathers. Think of a man assuming such a title, one which was ascribed by the Lord Jesus Christ to His Father. If I were in such an association as that and I was concerned about what was due to God, I would not tell any one of those so-called fathers what I was going to do. It is just as well not to tell them at all; you will be the worse off if you do. They will tie your hands and feet if they can. Understand, I am not attacking, but speaking the truth for the benefit of all of us in our service, and if one here has a father like Saul, do not tell him; he will hamper you. He hampered Jonathan. Saul forbade anyone to take food, the very thing they needed. Hunger will not help a soldier. This professed leader forbids these soldiers to eat; Jonathan did not hear it. The less you hear of such injunctions the better.
What I am speaking about is how a christian, one who is potentially a workman of God, may escape from the domination of such authority as Saul represents. Many of our brethren suffer from such and if light of God comes into our souls about the Father and the Son let us ignore these other influences. Jonathan did not tell his father, but the
{22}
situation was desperate as to the people of God. Philistines were everywhere and had all the instruments of warfare. None of the Israelites had swords except Saul and Jonathan. What is to be done? Well, if God works, the workmen will not tell such a father as Saul. God has intervened for the deliverance of His people; we are sharing in that now. We know how it happened. Those who wrought at the outset did not tell those fathers; they did not ask leave of their superiors. They went and did the work. They had recourse to private houses and the like instead of cathedrals. They would open their Bibles and understand what was to be done. They looked at the prophetic map. They prayed to their Father in secret and came in for the knowledge of His mind. He will say in secret, 'Well, My Son is the pattern'. On the mountain Moses was shown the pattern. So the Son of God is a pattern for the labourers. The relation between father and son belongs to the labourers; we are brought into it. True sons are workmen and will work as bondmen, for they have the affection and intelligence of sons and know what to do. No others do, save sons. So the Lord is the pattern. I am making due allowance for His personal deity in all these things. He has the pre-eminence.
Saul is floundering about and the people are at their wits¬ end. One pities them; they had refused the light of David which had already come in. A true exercised christian in such an association would say, 'I am going to take the matter in hand'. Jonathan no doubt had a time of prayer with God. It does not say so, but we have the Spirit of God who lets us, into the secret of what is behind. It says Elijah prayed for rain, but he prayed also for drought. Jonathan had been with God; God is his Father in truth; Saul would tie him up, he did as far as he could. Then we find Jonathan is busy
{23}
working with God. There are two rocks in the path, one on either side, but it does not deter him; he is working with God and he has an armour-bearer who is with him, and he is ready to give a lead, a great thing in the work of God. The spiritual lead is so essential for brothers and sisters. All are led on. Everyone can be in it. Everyone according to the gift of grace can come into this wonderful state of things. See @Luke 8, for instance. In @Luke 7 the woman partakes of the grace of Christ and gets forgiveness and serves. She loves much and so she is forgiven much. This woman is the idea. She is serving and becomes part of the administrative system. In @Luke 8 we find the Lord preaches the kingdom, going from city to city and village to village, and the twelve and the women are with Him. I am speaking to the sisters now. Amongst them is Mary Magdalene, out of whom went seven demons, possessing such a state of soul that there is no room for the demons now. They were not cast out; they went out. She is now for the Lord's service. They will never come back. Her state is reversed and it is impossible for the demons to come back, and instead of the demons she is serving Christ with her substance. You say, I have no gift, but you are part of the system and have been given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ, and the next thing is to use it. She used it and so should every woman minister to Christ of her substance. No one can say he has not substance.
Jonathan gives the idea of leading the brethren into workmanship with God. Every one of us can come into it. Jonathan has given the lead. Wherever love is this is the outcome. How humbly he serves. He crawls on his hands and feet. All things are possible with God. See how the workman loves to lead to it, so we can see here how we have to be humble. How lowlily the Lord moves on until He
{24}
comes to Gethsemane. "Thy will be done". @Matthew 26:42. He is working with His Father, so is Jonathan -- he is working with God. Many of our brethren are working with Saul, but he binds them up hands and feet. He has not the truth of sonship, it is not the father and son, in the true sense, but the kind of fatherhood that would hinder, and the man that will not tell them will soon be out and in the truth of the true Father and Son.
Now as to this matter of the honey, Saul forbade them to take it for food. Think of the folly of it; think of the folly of mere religiousness, to what lengths it will go to gratify its own pride at the expense of the workmen and testimony of God! But here was a true man working with God. There was honey, we are told. You may say that was forbidden, honey, the characteristic food of the land of Canaan which was flowing with milk and honey. No one could take it and yet he must fight. Is it not well to creep out and deny them any information about it? Say nothing to them. Jonathan crept on his hands and feet, filling a lowly place and creeping away from them. God was with him in doing it. One man and his armour-bearer and a great victory for the Lord.
We are told that the honey flowed @1 Samuel 14:26. See here is the folly of Saul's system, forbidding a warrior to take that food that God so bountifully provided! Jonathan heard not -- thank God he did not. If all Israel's warriors had heard not, there would be a victory, but they are not allowed to take of the food of the land of Canaan. The oath is upon them and hence the result is that they cannot fight as warriors. Well now, the crisis comes and Saul is ready to put his son to death, but the matter was not in his hands. God does not allow it. As we hold to the truth of the Father and Son, and work in that light and truth, and we are not afraid, we shall
{25}
continue in the work. Jonathan shows the way and God takes account of it. So the verse says, "The people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the Lord liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day" @1 Samuel 14:45.
Well, that is the sequel of all that I have been saying. We need not fear. It is the dispensation of grace. It is a matter of working with God or our work is of no use -- not telling the ecclesiastical authorities. The Lord Jesus gave the authority to His bondmen, not to the church dignitaries. His bondmen are to use it as the great and blessed Bondman used it, even as the Son working with the Father. Thank God there is that.
{26}
THE ONENESS OF THE BODY
@Exodus 12:46,47; @1 Kings 17:13; @1 Corinthians 10:16 (last clause),17
J.T. These scriptures are selected in the hope that we may learn through them how the body of Christ, as composed of all believers, is reached in the history of believers from the beginning. These scriptures, and others like them in the Old and the New Testaments: present the whole idea as applied to persons, or as applied to Christ or God or to the saints. The Old Testament laid down originally that "Jehovah our God is one Jehovah" (@Deuteronomy 6:4); that was foundational, running through. See also @Zechariah 14:9. In the New Testament we have the thought applied to our calling, "One body and one Spirit" and "one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in us all" @Ephesians 4:4 - 6, each great idea carrying the whole thought. So "to us there is one God, the Father ... and one Lord, Jesus Christ", @1 Corinthians 8:6. The Deity may be spoken of, either in the Father or in the Son or in the Spirit, but there is never any idea or suggestion of three deities -- always one. So the thoughts in these scriptures will suffice us to consider this subject. First the passover, the law requiring that a bone should not be broken -- that is, it is a whole thought, it is Christ, but, as it were, the whole thought as to Him, not partial. Then in Elijah we have what corresponds, namely, a cake, a little cake but still a whole thought. He first asked for a morsel of bread, but he eventually asked for a little cake to be made for him first; so, if we partake of the passover, "our passover", as it says, "sacrificed for us" @1 Corinthians 5:7 -- God would have His portion in the cake something that is the outcome of exercise, which the
{27}
cake suggests, however small. It is not part of a cake, but a cake, a little one but still a cake. Then in the third scripture we have the two thoughts combined; that is, the body of Christ, His own personal body which He took and in which He died, and out of that develops: "We, being many, are one loaf, one body" -- this all centring in the Lord's supper. We shall have, of course, in connection with the passover, to speak of what is initial in the believer's history, how this thought is there -- a constitutional thought, as we may call it -- from the very outset. The New Testament says, "Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth" @1 Corinthians 5:7,8, but it is Christ as a whole, as we may say, not a divided Christ; for that is the word the apostle uses in this epistle, "Is Christ divided?". @1 Corinthians 1:13. He is not divided; He is to be apprehended and appropriated as food in the passover, which presents the whole Person in a particular way, that is, a sacrificial way, the Lamb of God.
A.C. In the verse read it says, "In one house shall it be eaten".
J.T. Showing that it is on family lines, for God builds up the structure in that way on family lines. It develops into a nation in Israel, and in us it is one body.
E.B.G. Does the thought of sacrifice lie behind all these scriptures? In Exodus it is the passover; then in regard to the woman in Kings, the handful of meal seems to be all that was between her and death, and she is asked to surrender that; then there is the thought of Christ our passover, which you have alluded to.
J.T. I think that is good -- the sacrificial thought, for, aside from it, our spiritual constitution must be
{28}
extremely defective. John the baptist refers to the sacrifice; he saw Jesus coming to him and said, "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world". @John 1:29. He saw in Him what was sacrificial, as coming to him, and that must enter into our constitution as believers. We shall be very wanting and without correspondence entirely to Christ unless the sacrificial element is in our constitution.
Ques. What effect has the sacrificial side upon our constitution on our side in our walk and pathway?
J.T. It affects us so that we are persons who sacrifice; "To do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased" @Hebrews 13:16, and many other such scriptures. On a higher level, we are constituted priests according to Peter "to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ", @1 Peter 2:5. The word carries with it the thought of surrender; sacrifice costs us something; it cost Jesus Himself His life.
Rem. The whole thought is referred to in @John 1: "Behold the Lamb of God", @John 1:36 and towards the end of the gospel it is referred to by John the evangelist.
J.T. It carries the whole thought through in the sacrifice of Christ, "A bone of him shall not be broken". @John 19:36. In any sacrifice our Lord went through, it is Himself, it is the whole Christ, not a partial one. The failure to see this truth tends to sectarianism. "Is Christ divided?", @1 Corinthians 1:13 says the apostle; if He is not divided, then the saints should not be divided. If they are on a sacrificial line they will not be divided, they will be contributory to the whole thought, leading up to the truth of the assembly as the body of Christ.
E.L.M. At the beginning of the chapter there is provision made: if the house be too small, then the neighbour is called in; would that make allowance
{29}
for weakness on our part in apprehension, but the thought must be maintained?
J.T. Yes, so that, even if you call another in, the oneness of the sacrifice is maintained -- it is in one house.
E.L.M. Was that element of weakness at Corinth, and would the verse you are quoting, "Is Christ divided?", @1 Corinthians 1:13 guard against any sectarian thought?
J.T. That is what I thought. It is significant that the first rebuke we get in the epistle, which is full of admonition and correction, is that there were divisions among them; the whole idea must be preserved. So in a local meeting; in this city there may be three subdivisions, but the whole idea must be maintained -- it is one idea. If another nearby meeting is invited, that does not alter the position one iota. No matter how many meetings are invited or represented, it is a whole thought.
T.T. In the tabernacle there was a bar called the "middle bar" in the midst of the boards, reaching from one end to the other @Exodus 26:28; would that have any bearing on this?
J.T. It is the same thought -- one tabernacle; it is a sort of binding thought.
W.S.S. I was thinking of what is said about Paul. The Lord said, "I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake". @Acts 9:16. The truth of the body was in view, and I am wondering whether the entering into the truth of the body necessarily involves suffering.
J.T. I think it does. It was the thing that was in the Lord's mind when He spoke to Saul of Tarsus, "Why persecutest thou me?" @Acts 9:4. The "me" would be the saints as one body; they were suffering. Paul was to be shown how much he must suffer.
Ques. I am not quite sure if I have your thought. When the apostle said, "The Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me", @Galatians 2:20
{30}
would that touch what you have before you at all?
J.T. Well, the Lord sacrificed to have all of us, and the thought in the passover is, I think, that we appropriate that as food and it enters into the spiritual constitution so that each takes on a sacrificial attitude. Sacrificing is, in a way, the very essence of christianity. So that when John saw the Lord Jesus coming to him he said, "Behold the Lamb of God", @John 1:29 meaning that he saw in Him what was here in the types. It is a Person greater than you or me, for the passover suggests the greatness of Christ, One who carries the thing through. Then he says, "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world" @John 1:29 -- an immense thought! Only a divine Person could undertake it, but He undertook it sacrificially. I believe the word here comes in in the instructions, possibly a late item in the instructions, but it is because you are all the more prepared now. The passover has a great place throughout the types, and this coming in so late is alluded to again in @Numbers 9, where the passover might be celebrated a month later because of unspirituality. Yet this whole thought must be maintained, it must always be in mind, "A bone of him shall not be broken". @John 19:36.
Ques. In your reference to the passover and Christ having been sacrificed, the previous verse says, "Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump" @1 Corinthians 5:7; is that the idea in mind in 1 Kings where we have the cake, a complete thought?
J.T. That is good. A new lump, and he says, "according as ye are unleavened", a comforting thought as to the company locally; it is abstractly unleavened. So the cake would stand on the side of the saints, I think, what the saints are, and that is what Elijah had in mind; he asked for a morsel first. Speaking to the woman he says, "Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand", @1 Kings 17:11
{31}
and then she says, "I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse", @1 Kings 17:12 and so on. And Elijah said to her, "Make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me". It seems as if the local conditions were in mind when she spoke about the meal. He had spoken of a morsel of bread, but she had not a cake, she said, but she had the meal; she had the means of making a cake. Spiritually it would mean that, even in a low condition, the whole thought may be there. Saints are sometimes a great deal better off than they think they are.
E.L.M. Is that exemplified in @Mark 8? The disciples had taken no bread with them on board the vessel *save one loaf*, as though they had overlooked that; it was there all the time.
J.T. Yes, that was it; they had the whole thought.
E.L.M. Is that what you mean in saying that the saints are not so badly off as possibly they think they are?
J.T. I think that is a very practical thought, for we are apt to take low conditions for granted and perhaps be too impoverished in our thoughts, as the widow of whom we read; she did not realise what she had in the house. If there is a little meal, however small, even a handful -- she says, "An handful of meal" -- well, that is something, a measured amount. And it is kept in a right place; a barrel is where it should be kept. There is very little; things are very impoverished and the barrel is almost empty, but still there is a little there, and that seems to have emboldened the prophet to ask for the cake. So I think in ministering, the initial thought would be to discover what there is in the place and make the most of that. The first meeting may bring out more than you have anticipated, and you may be encouraged to bring out great thoughts about Christ and about the saints too. But I think that handful
{32}
of meal means some measured amount of knowledge and appreciation of Christ.
A.C. Have you in mind that prophetic ministry would help us in a locality to use what there is?
J.T. I think it bears on that very decidedly. You say, 'We have not a gifted brother here; I do not think we are equal to the ministry'; but then, you cannot be sure. One brother may come with something and another brother may get something while sitting there and that is the sovereign side. You can never be sure what the Lord will do in that way: He may take up someone you have never thought of.
-.A. Do you think the little oil suggested a cake to the prophet?
J.T. Well, she says, "An handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse" @1 Kings 17:12 -- evidently both would be in mind; possibly the one referring to the apprehension we have of Christ in His humanity as coming in manhood, and the other to the Spirit; so that there is the means for a cake, a whole thought. As we have been remarking as to a ministry meeting, you may get a good time if you are simple about it and make allowance for what there may be there. A handful is a small amount, but measured; and the oil is a small amount, but in a cruse. In each case the material was where it should be; it is not held loosely, it is held in a vessel; things are therefore in order, and God may do more than I expect, for the handful would be what a brother might have in his soul. But then there is that which is revealed to one sitting by -- one who is capable of having a thing revealed to him. He is fundamentally, in christianity, yielding to Christ and the Spirit, so that the Spirit can operate in him.
W.S. Would you say it was right, in coming together to a ministry meeting, to have something definitely before you, although you may not give it out?
{33}
J.T. I would; I believe we may rightly have something before us, for @1 Corinthians 14, dealing with this matter, says, "Every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine", @1 Corinthians 14:26,or whatever it may be; a prophet may have something and he may stand up and give it out. But then there is the thought of something being revealed to one sitting by; maybe he did not bring anything, but he is available for revelation. That is a great matter, it belongs to christianity, to be ready for a revelation; the spirit of wisdom and revelation is the thing the apostle prays for for us. If I have that spirit, I am available for the Spirit of God to reveal something to me. If so and you are speaking, you might sit down; if you are in the sense of the organism you know you have finished; the Spirit has withdrawn His power from you, for He is going to use someone else. The order is one at a time; it is one idea all the time. Therefore the one who has the revelation would suggest the sovereign side, the Spirit giving something at the moment.
Ques. Would you always look for a prophetic word in one of these meetings?
J.T. Well, it might not be exactly that, because it says, "How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, everyone of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying". @1 Corinthians 14:26. Then "Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge. If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace. For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted. And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets". @1 Corinthians 14:29 - 32. Prophecy is the main thought, but it seems as if room is made for these other things; they may be needed; we may need teaching, or a psalm which would involve
{34}
experience. A brother might be able to speak on those lines, but generally the thought is prophecy.
Ques. In asking the question, I thought that the scripture you read suggested a certain amount of substance in the company. Every company as controlled by the Spirit should have substance, should it not?
J.T. That is, I think, what we see in 1 Kings. The woman had very little, but she had something, and that is what led the prophet to ask for the cake. As we were saying, it was a small amount, but it was measured. She had in her mind that something could be done with it; she could eat and die, but of course that was a reversal of the principle governing the position; eating is to live, and that is what the Spirit of God brings out, "Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth". @1 Kings 17:14. We can understand spiritually that, if Christ is held in any gathering or in any soul, there is substance that can be utilised, and that does not fail; there is no idea of failure. It is a question of what it is spiritually that Christ on His side will not fail, nor the Spirit either. Prophetic ministry here, it seems to me, made room for what there was in the woman's soul, so you have the dignified word 'house' -- "she, and he, and her house, ate a whole year". @1 Kings 17:15
I.R. In the light of your remarks in connection with the one cake, would we expect, in a meeting for ministry, to find unity of expression, whether it be in; two or three?
J.T. I think that is it -- one person at a time, one idea at a time. The passage shows there is substance there, and then revelation coming in to add to that.
J.W. The exercise of the moment would be to learn to hold the substance in relation to what
{35}
Elijah sets forth, the bringing in of the mind of God and learning to hold it.
J.T. That is what comes out. The woman is amenable to the prophet's word. It says, "She went and did according to the word of Elijah; and she, and he, and her house, ate a whole year". @1 Kings 17:15. The word of Elijah would be, of course, a prophetic word governing us, so that we should be on the alert to get it; we should have enlargement, we should have food.
Ques. Did the household of Cornelius afford conditions? Peter said, "I perceive that God is no respecter of persons". @Acts 10:34.
J.T. It was one of the pointed features of the position that God comes in by way of revelation, but then there is substance there already. The whole substance in @Acts 10 circles around the idea of what is to be eaten.
Ques. Was the Lord challenging the hearts of the disciples when He said, "Give *ye* them to eat"? @Matthew 14:16
J.T. Quite so, they were reminded that they should be ready to provide food.
Ques. I would like to ask, does this apply to any brother in the locality, or must they definitely have gift?
J.T. Of course gift is in mind in the chapter, but it is very significant that it is stressed that it is subject to desire, and the chapter shows that prophecy is what is needed, because it edifies and meets conditions in a remarkable way, as the chapter teaches; the prophets are contemplated right down. But the idea of revelation might bring out that there was someone present who had ability in that way unknown to him before. These meetings bring out what there is in the locality. We cannot always be sure; there may be latent ability which opportunity brings out; we have to remember we are in a day of small things. We cannot look for such
{36}
as obtained at Corinth where they came behind in no gift; evidently there was much gift there but badly used. But we are speaking of the possibility of gift being just latent and the opportunity bringing it out.
E.L.M. Would it not be very encouraging to Elijah that what he starts with in the scripture he finds in a moment of apparent defeat; when he was awakened by the angel in the wilderness, he found a cake of bread; the divine thought had not failed?
J.T. It is very remarkable that should come in in his ministry, baken on hot coals, and that the meal and cruse are mentioned only once in @1 Kings 19, but in the end he eats twice -- it is a second meal from that supply. There is the whole thought there too, what he needs. He had begun with the whole thought, but, as far as he knew, there was no Israel left except himself, and he could hardly represent the whole thought, he was only one person; no one person can represent the assembly in any sense. He failed, I think, in carrying through this idea of the little cake; the angel suggests it to him and he eats twice and goes in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights.
E.L.M. Would the idea of the unity of the whole thought express itself in him in a moment of great spiritual brightness when he built the altar of twelve stones? Did he lapse for a moment from the light which had governed him?
J.T. It seems so. We have the unity, the whole thought, in the passover, and the little cake refers to the unity of God's people, the perfect unity; the twelve refers to the administrative side. It is what is before God and affords a basis for administration, so that I think he was thoroughly in the light of this little cake when he took the twelve stones according to the number of the sons of Jacob and spoke of them as those to whom the word of God came.
{37}
He was fully in the light of the position then. Chapter 17 is the unity, the little cake; chapter 18 is the administrative side, I think, in the twelve: that is the same idea, only that it is turned round and individuals are it, usable according to love. That is, I think, what Corinthians brings out, that, while we can be used one by one, used separately, we are used in love, we are not in each other's way.
W.S.S. Chapter 19 is very necessary for us. What Elijah had to be reminded of is very important and we should be reminded of it, the whole thought suggested in the little cake.
J.T. I think so. It is a very important thought, one that ought to lay hold of every young christian, for we shall never fit into the assembly without it.
W.S.S. And it is part of his secret history with God.
J.T. Evidently, you could not have a man like Elijah without secret history with God.
A.H.G. I was thinking of our appreciation of Christ. Have you in mind that we should appreciate in measure every way in which this thought is presented?
J.T. Well, John says, "the Lamb of God". @John 1:29. That is a sacrificial thought, but then he goes on to testify that this is the Son of God and that is a sacrificial thought in another setting. It is Christ in either case, only there are so many sides to His Person. The point is to get the whole idea at any given time, not a part of Christ, because that is sectarian, just as the parting of His garments is sectarian.
W.S.S. So that the apprehension of Christ in the way you are speaking of is dependent on what is in the passover, the understanding of the thought of the body. Would that be right?
J.T. Yes, that is what I was thinking. It may be subdivided, for the sake of convenience; it is indicated plainly that there were subdivisions in the
{38}
assembly, but it is always the assembly, however many subdivisions there are. But then the difficulty now amongst the brethren is, I believe, that each subdivision is apt to act as though it were the whole, and the whole thought in the city is ignored. It is not simply that we say we are a subdivision, but there ought to be some concrete expressions of it, the more the better. The breaking of bread is not a concrete expression of it, for there are several meetings, and I think @1 Corinthians 14 has in mind that the saints should, as often as possible, have concrete evidence of the oneness of the assembly in any given sphere -- it is the whole assembly coming together in one place.
W.S.S. Our having substance is really consequent on this position being entered into.
J.T. We see how the little substance the woman had is made use of.
A.C. Are we apt to make too much of our meeting-rooms and miss the idea of the assembly in a city? Does Scripture refer to meeting-rooms?
J.T. I think so; we have, for instance, the assembly in a man's house in a given town, at Rome or Ephesus. It is quite obvious that that assembly in that brother's house does not include all.
J.T.S. When you spoke of the breaking of bread not being a concrete example, had you in mind what I think you have called attention to elsewhere, first, "when ye come together in assembly", in @1 Corinthians 11:18, and then, "the whole assembly come together in one place", in @1 Corinthians 14:23?
J.T. Yes, the article is dropped, as you know, in chapter 11 -- we come together *in assembly*, it is the character of the thing; but in chapter 14 it is the *whole assembly*, the article is placed before the word 'assembly', meaning that all are there; the sub-divisional idea is dropped, the whole thought is there in a concrete way; thus the man who gets help
{39}
through the prophesying reports that God is amongst you of a truth. That would be the saints at Corinth as a whole, God's best in a place, what He has.
E.B.G. I am sure we see the importance of what you are pressing as to oneness. Would the opportunities for such expression be limited to the coming together for ministry and perhaps to a joint reading meeting in a city? Are there any other practical suggestions?
J.T. The point in it seems to be what is publicly beneficial. It is not service Godward that is in mind, but rather what is beneficial to men, to the saints, if God is to bring out what He has in any given place. That is the idea in the administrative side in the assembly, what God is doing in local companies. There is no idea in the scripture of a central or metropolitan company; it is any town or village where there may be an assembly. So you have, in @Acts 14, Paul and Barnabas selecting elders for each assembly, and, then they appoint elders in every city, as if a city has the testimony manward in mind; it is a concrete representation in any given place.
Ques. Does it come in in relation to the benefit the city receives -- all administrative work should be done in the light of the oneness?
J.T. Quite so, it is the inner thought. So that they appointed elders for each assembly, that would be, as it were, the assembly as sustaining light, and there is something there that would represent God; An elder is described, he represents one who maintains order, and so a city might have several small subdivisions, but elders being appointed there (the appointment, I believe, is always of *elders*, not an *elder*) there is the means of maintaining what is due to God for man's benefit. Hence a man comes in and the secrets of his heart are made manifest, he is convicted and judged of all and falling down on his
{40}
face he worships God. He is benefited, but then God has His portion immediately through it.
F.W.W. Would this suggest an assembly in very weak conditions? We often find that small meetings say, We have not the ability here for it. Would this encourage such meetings?
J.T. It is intended to encourage us on that line, and Jehovah's word through the prophet was that the woman was to maintain him, showing there is a great thought attaching to any assembly, however low down, to maintain the testimony, and in order to maintain the testimony -- for that is the word used to Elijah -- there must be the making use of what there is in a place.
F.W.W. The widow collecting two sticks does not suggest anything very large.
J.T. No, she had a very low thought; she was going to eat and die, but at the word of the prophet everything is altered, so that there is the idea of maintenance and the dignified word 'house' is used.
W.S.S. It is very encouraging in connection with small and weak meetings to think of their possibilities in relation to the maintenance of the testimony.
J.T. I think so. I think it is one of the most painful things to think of a meeting being allowed to die out under the very eyes of the meetings nearby, whereas procedure of this kind would lead to revival, the prophetic word bringing God in. What is there there? Maybe a sister, a young person, a sick person, or what not -- but there is revival.
Ques. In a meeting that is dying out, would you look for a revival in the way of an exercise as to taking up things in this way?
J.T. I think that would be the thing. I think we look for too much, the Lord is able to make a little go a long way if we take up the prophetic ministry. See the great thought God had about this woman when He spoke to Elijah about her. She
{41}
was a long way off when Jehovah spoke to Elijah about her, and said, "I have commanded a widow woman there to maintain thee". @1 Kings 17:9. You would not think there was ever a command given to her of God.
Ques. Would the whole year suggest maintenance in the varied circumstances of the whole period of testing in every season?
J.T. Well, you see what it says, "She, and he, and her house, ate a whole year", @1 Kings 17:15 we only hear of one boy, the son. They ate a whole year, throughout all the seasons the prophet is maintained rightly, but the woman and her house are maintained too.
A.F.G. Should we take courage from the meal and oil being used, that the meal in the barrel does not waste nor the oil fail in the cruse? If what we have is used, may we feel encouraged that there will be this further supply?
J.T. I think that is the lesson spiritually. It means that some one or ones in the place have an apprehension of Christ, and also of the Spirit -- for there was the oil too -- and they had the apprehension in an orderly way, not held loosely; they valued what they had.
Ques. The prophet was sent directly at the word of the Lord. Would you look that things should be revived in this way in a local meeting, or would you expect it to spring up?
J.T. Well, in either way, for the prophet is sent to be maintained, not to revive, although it was necessary, for the lesson to be learnt is that God fills us with his own great thoughts. He commands -- whatever it may be in the working out of it -- He commanded a widow to maintain the prophet in this case. That is the great thought; it is the testimony that is in mind and the continuance of the testimony in the place. So it is not simply a question of the few saints there may be in the place, but God says,
{42}
'I have a testimony in that place and I want it maintained', and in this way you get revival and the prophetic ministry is brought in. So it is not simply that the prophet is maintained, but the testimony is held.
T.T. In a meeting where there are only sisters left, would it be right to carry on the meeting with only brothers visiting?
J.T. Well, it is a question of deciding what is in the place, whether there is this handful of meal, for that may be in sisters as well as in brothers; and I certainly believe that, if there be the handful of meal and the cruse of oil held ready -- if these sisters have the idea of the assembly, the whole thought -- every effort should be made to help them to maintain that thought, for there is a testimony in it.
W.S.S. Perhaps we have not sufficiently realised our responsibility to neighbouring meetings where conditions are very feeble.
J.T. I think that may be, for if there be in a place a handful of meal and a little oil; that is, the apprehension of Christ and the Spirit -- that is a real christian condition -- and these things are held rightly, not loosely -- the meal is in a barrel and the oil in a cruse -- well, the testimony is involved in that. I think it is a very right thing for a brother or brothers there to see to it that what is needed is supplied so that the one idea of the assembly continues.
J.I. Do you think, if there are conditions, God will send someone there as He sent Elijah to the widow?
J.T. No doubt, but, as we were saying, that is not the way the matter is put: Elijah is not sent to help her, but to be maintained. He represents the testimony, but, as there, he represents the prophetic ministry that enlarges on what is there. It is quite right that God will take care of a condition like this
{43}
and send somebody, but I think the lesson today is, not that God will do that, but that we should do it; the obligation is on us, I am not to leave to God what I should do. You do it, you give them to eat; the Lord knew what He would do, but you take the obligation.
H.V. So that she comes first in verse 15, "She, and he, and her house". @1 Kings 17:15
J.T. Yes, she is the responsible element here -- she is a sister; and her house, that is the responsible local element. But the primary thought of God in the matter is that the testimony is maintained.
-.F. Is the word of the prophet Haggai a great encouragement to us in broken days? "I am with you, saith the Lord of hosts: according to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not". @Haggai 2:4,5. Have you the full idea in that chapter, and it was only a short time before they began to build the house of God at Jerusalem?
J.T. That is good, and not only that but "The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former" @Haggai 2:9 -- the whole idea is carried through, only it would be more glorious. The thought of the latter glory of the house is very encouraging.
In the third scripture we see how the thing culminates in the New Testament. The gospel of Matthew brings out that the Lord, in instituting His supper, says, "Take, eat; this is my body" @Matthew 26:26 -- not 'This is my *flesh'*, but "my body", maintaining in the New Testament what we have been speaking of, in a striking way. Paul takes it up in regard to our public position with one another, because the breaking of bread in 1 Corinthians alludes to the fellowship. In actually partaking of the Supper the point is not the fellowship but the order of it in the assembly, but the fellowship is the public side covering our everyday life and is brought in here so as to maintain
{44}
the whole thought, so that we do not lose it, we do not forget it, we carry it through and recognise that we are all one; we are one body in the fellowship as partaking of the Lord's supper. So I think it is good, in chapter 10, to keep this before us, and that the thoughts should not be weakened in us as to what we are locally, "We being many are one bread, and one body". And the communion of the body of Christ brings in in Matthew the whole thought, but then, our relations with one another are included; we are to hold each other in this light; everything we do publicly throughout the week has this in mind, the maintenance of the one whole thought in the locality.
{45}
FELLOWSHIP, LOCAL AND GENERAL
@1 Corinthians 1:1 - 3; @2 Corinthians 1:1 - 5; @Galatians 1:1 - 5; @Colossians 4:16
I thought we might look at the thought of fellowship in its local and general aspect. The opening verses of these epistles, 1 and 2 Corinthians and Galatians, remind us that fellowship is not only local, that is, it is not only to be experienced and enjoyed at a particular locality, but that it is universal. The first epistle speaks of "all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours". The assembly at Corinth is addressed, but these words are added indicating the universality of the fellowship. Then there is the second letter which is more limited to a province, "the assembly of God which is in Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia", but which extends beyond the assembly addressed. Then in Galatians, "to the assemblies of Galatia", not addressing any one of them, but all of them; in the district or province the assemblies are addressed as on equal footing. Then in Colossians we see how the nearby meeting, the assembly of Laodiceans, is linked up with the assembly. The earlier verses might have been mentioned, verse 13, "For I bear him witness that he labours much for you, and them in Laodicea ... . Salute the brethren in Laodicea ... And when the letter has been read among you, cause that it be read also in the assembly of Laodiceans, and that *ye* also read that from Laodicea". @Colossians 4:13,16. Both letters were to be read in each meeting. But the first address, 1 Corinthians, is to be considered first. What the apostle has to say to this assembly is meant for all the brethren, all the saints, so what happens among the saints is a concern to all. Then in the second letter we have something more limited, that is the area, or province. Both letters have discipline
{46}
in mind. So that matters of discipline are particularly to be before us wherever they are, especially in meetings near by; they are our affair. Then if it is a matter of doctrine, the whole province might be affected by bad doctrine; that is what occurred in Galatia. Then in regard to Colosse and Laodicea, it is more the salutations and ministry of the servant, so that the letter written to one was applicable to both meetings, showing that there was happy fellowship among them, showing too that there is increased responsibility.
J.L. You mean what happens in this place would be a concern to all the saints wherever they are?
J.T. The great general thought of the fellowship is that it includes all the saints. Then there is the idea of proximity: the nearer we are to a place the more we are responsible, for instance in this area, or any industrial area such as Lancashire, the saints are very likely to be affected similarly. So here the fishing industry brings about likeness of feelings and outlook, so that we are all the more responsible to each other to understand each other; what affects one is a common matter to all the saints in the district, but it is also a common matter to all the saints everywhere. The same thing would apply to London, the saints would understand each other in what affects them from an imperial or metropolitan outlook. The outlook and occupation that characterise the place become a means of bringing about likeness of feelings for each other.
W.F. Would Paul the apostle, and Sosthenes the brother, suggest authority? Is the idea of authority connected with fellowship, the assembly of God implying what is really of God in that city?
J.T. Quite so. "Sosthenes the brother". It was blended with brotherly feelings. Authority is not enough. Then in anything that is done we have the whole assembly to reckon with. It is a common
{47}
matter, it has to be met in a common way. We cannot say, 'It is not ours, we will keep hands off'. It is the fellowship of our Lord Jesus.
W.A.S. Does in any way the principle of the body enter into this, "If one member suffer, all the members suffer with it"? @1 Corinthians 12:26.
J.T. That is the very thought of the fellowship. All that brings out how bound up the brethren are. The nearer we are to the brethren the more we would feel every matter as our own.
A.M. Is that how Paul and Sosthenes come in together? There was lack of power and lack of brotherly spirit at Corinth.
J.T. Paul brings in Timothy in the second epistle. What a brother he was! Paul speaks of him to them with great affection throughout the epistle.
A.M. So that it would weigh equally on both sides. So that when fresh ministry comes out let us have it; when fresh help comes in in difficulties, let us have the brotherly spirit to receive it!
J.T. The assembly is endowed with governments and helps.
G.M. Is there any special significance in the fact that Sosthenes means vigorous? Would that be the mark of a true brother? I noticed in your prayer you referred to being marked by energy.
J.T. If this is his name he ought to be vigorous. Energy under those circumstances is to be desired. The gospel of Mark would help us as to this: things are done at once. At the end of Mark we find the young man in white robes at the sepulchre; he represents youthful energy for the service of God.
C.M. Would this widening out in the second verse of chapter 1 keep us from being circumscribed?
J.T. What you remark is good. It is a widening out: "to the assembly of God which is in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints". They are 'called', that is, God has made a selection
{48}
of them, "with all that in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ", meaning that we are addressed as those who depend on the Lord and on His name. "Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered". @Romans 10:13. There is power on our behalf.
G.M. So that when difficulties arise that cannot be dealt with, "They beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them", @Luke 5:7.
J.T. That is good.
G.M. We do not very readily do that in this district.
J.T. That may be a weakness. "They beckoned to their partners". @Luke 5:7. The word 'partner' in verse 7 is a different word from the word 'partner' in verse 10, which means 'those who share alike'. We all gain if help comes in. The whole assembly gains. These verses are quite applicable to what we are saying now. In @Luke 5:6 it says, "their net brake" -- a local calamity -- but they knew what to do: "They beckoned unto their partners ... that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink". @Luke 5:7. In verse 10 where it says, "James, and John ... were partners with Simon", @Luke 5:10 that word 'partner' alludes to mutual sharing; the other word is more distant: persons near by, ready to help. It is very significant that these difficulties brought about Peter's confession. It is often the case. The real difficulty lies in some sin not confessed. So here they beckoned to their partners -- it is good to call on our partners -- and this partner service is rendered. It will be observed that the Lord Himself did not help them to save the fish, that is, He would have them do it. The fish were caught under His direction, but then the Lord does not give any directions as to the ship, as if sometimes the Lord would say, 'Ye should know what to do
{49}
yourselves'. They knew: "They beckoned to their partners". @Luke 5:7.
A.M. Sometimes in a difficulty when we see the way out, we go on praying about it, and we do not do the thing.
J.T. We ought to know what to do. If we do not know, the Lord will indicate it. These fishermen did know. If a matter happens in C. and you do not know what to do, and there is a brother at P. who does know, why do you not seek him?
G.M. So that we are adjusted in relation to that matter, and grace and peace follow.
J.T. In the doing of it God acts for us.
J.L. What is implied in Peter's confession?
J.T. The sense of his sinfulness and the Lord's holiness. It was he who said to the Lord Jesus, "To whom shall we go?". @John 6:68. He said that, and we see it here, the Lord's holiness and his own unfitness. So that holiness becomes God's house for ever.
C.M. In @Acts 27 when they were afraid of going to lose the ship Paul says, "Ye should have hearkened unto me". @Acts 27:21. There was a man of God, if only they had listened to him.
J.T. Very good. Very often we refuse counsel. The Lord Himself is offering to give counsel, He says to Laodicea, "I counsel thee". @Revelation 3:18. In @Psalm 16 Jehovah gave Him counsel: "I will bless the Lord, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons". @Psalm 16:7. Of Nehemiah it says in a great difficulty: "I consulted with myself", @Nehemiah 5:7. That means he was not a party man; he was a wise man; he took counsel with himself. He had an influence with the brethren and the difficulty was mightily solved. In @Proverbs 11:14 we are told, "Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety". @Proverbs 11:14. So it is well to get the brethren together. The Lord may give a word of wisdom.
{50}
Ques. Are these conditions seen in @Acts 18 first with Paul, and then with Aquila and Priscilla, they were able to help Apollos?
J.T. They were able to do it, a man and his wife able to help a brother. As regards Paul in the ship it says, "Ye should have hearkened unto me". @Acts 27:21. How often we refuse counsel! We should weigh over every counsel.
R.S. You mean things should not lie dormant?
J.T. Well, they would fester. Isaiah said about a boil, Put a cake of figs on it. "Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death". @James 5:20. If a brother can do that, he does an exploit. James gives us examples of individual exploits. Elias did a similar service, he prayed earnestly that it might not rain. That is an exploit in prayer. So that we are to look about and see what is available in the meetings.
T.M. So you would not exclude a visiting brother from the care meeting?
J.T. No, you may be excluding a word for the moment. The visiting brother ought to be judicious.
R.S. The local brethren would know the case better.
J.T. Quite so. The Lord would not pass them by either. Well, that is the general thought here in the first epistle. In the second letter the area is reduced to the province of Achaia. This time it is the brother Timothy that is linked up with the apostle in writing, a man known to the Corinthians as having been sent to them.
F.I. Could what has been said as to the individual exploit apply in this way: some brother in one meeting goes to a brother in another meeting, he can do that without interfering in the local meeting?
J.T. Quite so.
{51}
C.M. What is conveyed in the expression "in the whole of Achaia"? Is that the place that Paul had in view where the recovery took place?
J.T. Paul had in mind the whole of the province. He had recovery in mind. Recovery is more difficult than penalty. It would seem that the neighbouring gatherings should be present in this matter: a man who was a terrible sinner was to break bread again, so that the distant meetings were to be one with this.
C.M. I was wondering if the whole district had been affected by the judgment of the assembly at Corinth.
J.T. That is a good remark. The district is sure to be affected. The brethren in the district ought to be with that judgment, if it is for right or wrong. So the apostle here is rightly approaching the whole district.
J.L. Is there anything in the fact that he is writing a letter to them rather than going personally?
J.T. Well, he wrote because he does not want to be too severe. The letter is to prepare the way for his coming.
J.L. So it is all the more important that in each letter he is linking a brother with him.
J.T. It is important. Grace marked the apostle.
Ques. Is he on the outlook for comfort and encouragement here?
J.T. That is what is in view in the second letter. So there is the selection of Timothy instead of Sosthenes.
J.L. Timothy would have genuine feelings for them.
J.T. These are the men that we should look for.
G.M. Is there a possibility of brethren not coming into line with the care meeting and matters being discussed outside of the care meeting?
J.T. The care meeting is never final, nor should it ever reach a decision. Major matters should always
{52}
be regarded at the care meeting as proposals, never final. If there are any brethren discussing about them afterwards there is no principle involved; advice in the interval may be of use. What I think is most destructive is the lack of loyalty. A brother says, 'I go with that', and when the care meeting is over he again expresses his doubts. That is what is destructive! We ought to be *men*. "Quit yourselves like men", @1 Corinthians 16:13. Do not be different outside of the meeting from what you are inside! We ought not to be vacillating. We were speaking of Jonathan in one of the meetings, how manly he was; when David was in danger he went straight to his father and told him that David was not worthy of death. He jeopardised himself. He faced his father as a man. To say what we think is one thing, but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety. Another brother might have different information.
G.A. Would you say the care meeting is the proper place to express any information that we may have? There is a danger of a party spirit otherwise.
J.T. Quite so. We ought to be men; we ought to mean what we say.
Ques. Does not Rehoboam show us the danger of divided counsel? He first took counsel with the old men, and then with the young men and finally he lost the people.
J.T. I am glad you brought that in. I have often thought about Rehoboam. He first consulted with the old brothers, and then he took counsel with the young brothers, those who were brought up with him; they gave him different counsel, counsel that was disastrous. If Rehoboam wanted counsel he should have had the young and the old together. The old brothers might have convinced the young men that their counsel was not right. So at the care meeting it should be the old and the young taking counsel together.
{53}
Ques. Would it not be right to use pressure in the care meeting?
J.T. What do you mean by using pressure? One might persuade a brother as to right or wrong. Counsellors *are* counsellors; they take counsel with others: "In the multitude of counsellors there is safety". @Proverbs 11:14.
C.M. Would you say the great danger is in listening to two different kinds of counsel as Rehoboam did? The danger is the clique business.
J.T. Rehoboam should have had the old and the young brothers together. The young brothers by themselves gave disastrous counsel. There was pride there.
C.M. So with Paul in the ship; the owner's counsel was selfish counsel.
J.T. The owner had a different outlook. "Ye should have hearkened unto me". @Acts 27:21 If the assembly refuses to listen to Paul it is shipwreck. His are the last words as, to assembly discipline.
A.M. What about the legal teaching in Galatia?
J.T. The legal teaching enters into this. The knowledge of God would deliver us from legality. The whole province had been affected by the leaven of legality. So the apostle addresses all the saints in the assemblies in it. It is to indicate that a certain locality may be affected by a certain evil. If we see the thing arise we must set our faces against it at once.
Then the Colossian matter is rather happy. It is a question of interchange of the happiest kind. They seem to be in very happy relations with the other meetings. The apostle speaks of Epaphras, of whom he says, "He labours much for you, and them in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis". @Colossians 4:13. Those were the adjacent meetings. This brings out that the brother who resides in the locality is concerned especially about the brethren in the neighbouring meetings; so
{54}
the brethren on the coast here have a special concern for one another. Then he says, "Salute the brethren in Laodicea" @Colossians 4:15 -- Paul, the great servant who loved them all, asks the brethren in Colosse to salute the brethren in Laodicea -- "and when the letter has been read among you" -- it is read to all, possibly at the end of a prayer meeting -- "cause that it be read also in the assembly of Laodiceans, and that *ye* also read that from Laodicea". This speaks of the happy state that exists between nearby meetings.
T.M. Could you please tell us the procedure of an assembly meeting? Do we wait on the Lord for a decision?
J.T. The decision is in the assembly: "Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven", @Matthew 18:18. The assembly does it, and heaven recognises that. The facts are presented as briefly as possible, and the judgment which scripture would require is stated. That is final; heaven recognises that.
T.M. It would be a solemn thing to go against that.
J.T. It would indeed.
R.S. So in the care meeting we would have a thing properly understood before it comes to the assembly.
J.T. Yes. As was said, "In the multitude of counsellors there is safety". @Proverbs 11:14 It is not decided, it is only proposed.
A.M. So it would be the facts that the assembly is to go by.
J.T. Every word would be established.
Rem. So I could not say at a care meeting that I would not break bread with a brother.
J.T. If you do that you put yourself out of fellowship.
{55}
T.M. Would you ask the one who might come under discipline to be present at the assembly meeting?
J.T. He should be there. "Those that sin convict before all", @1 Timothy 5:20. If he is not there he exposes himself; he ought to be there.
Rem. When a legal matter came up in @Acts 15 the elders inquired into it first, and then it came to the assembly.
J.T. Very good, they inquired into it first. But Paul tells them everything that was very happy; he would have no natural feelings to hold and upset the brethren.
{56}
THE HOUSE OF GOD MARKED BY THE DISCIPLINE OF GOD
@Genesis 32:22 - 32; @1 Chronicles 21:26,27; @1 Peter 4:17
What is in mind is to show that the house of God is marked by the discipline of God. I have selected these scriptures to show this, Jacob and David and Peter being three servants peculiarly linked with the house of God who came peculiarly under the discipline of God. We may gather therefore as in the house but we must come under discipline in order to continue according to God. There are three kinds of discipline and it is well to mention them: the discipline of the Father according to @Hebrews 12, the discipline of the Lord according to @1 Corinthians 11 and other scriptures, and the discipline of the assembly according to @Matthew 18 and @1 Corinthians 5 and other scriptures. I mention these three kinds of discipline, for I believe it will help us to bear in mind that they exist. They have to be regarded separately and they stand in separate settings, but all make for suitable conditions in the house of God. The enemy's aim is to spoil the conditions inaugurated at Pentecost in the house of God, to spoil the general conditions of the assembly, not only in its general setting, but also in local conditions. These attacks of the enemy have been especially seen in recent years in local eruptions, some of which have to be classified as ordered of God. Indeed it is said, "There must be also heresies" (or 'sects') "among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you". @1 Corinthians 11:19. This is in keeping with what is said in Leviticus, "I put a leprous plague in a house", @Leviticus 14:34. The principle to see is that God has allowed it, indeed we might more correctly
{57}
say, God has ordered it. Take David's great sin in numbering the people; in one place it says, "Satan ... moved David to number Israel". @1 Chronicles 21:1. And in another place it says, "Jehovah ... moved David ... . Go, number Israel and Judah". @2 Samuel 24:1. So in relation to Job's discipline, it was directly ordered of God. Satan suggested it, but God ordered it. It is a solemn fact to come under the government of God. God might order Satan to attack any one of us. At least these scriptures would challenge all our hearts as to conduct and ways, lest one day the government of God be against us, but really for us -- a solemn thing that Satan should be let loose and allowed to attack us. We may well think of the value of the prayer the Lord taught the disciples: "Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil". @Matthew 6:13. It was a solemn thing to be led into temptation, but it was to bring out what was there. The Lord Himself was led into temptation. The Lord came out triumphantly; Peter did not. "Satan hath desired to have you" @Luke 22:31 -- that is all of you. Peter did not come out gloriously, he failed before the onslaught. It is a solemn thing that we are allowed to give way. But God says, 'I ordered it, there is something to bring out': really, as it should read of the man at Corinth, "To deliver him, I say, being such, to Satan for destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus". @1 Corinthians 5:5. Thank God, it was saved before that. It was very encouraging indeed; he was saved very quickly; the apostle had to urge the brethren to restore him. Such was the effect of the discipline. What an instrument it is in the ordering of God. These are extreme cases I am speaking of now. In fact discipline goes on all the time, but these are extreme cases to show how God orders it expressly to bring out what we are. God says, 'I just order a proceeding against you'; it is really for us, but it is against us at the time.
{58}
Now I want to take up Jacob as the first illustration, he is outstanding. It is remarkable how definitions that have a place in the divine vocabulary come out, and how different ones name them. The house of God comes under that setting. Jacob says, "This is none other but the house of God". @Genesis 28:17. David says, "This is the house of the Lord God". @1 Chronicles 22:1. There was no question about it, showing what a spiritual man he was. It says, "David; who found favour before God, and asked to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob ... But the Most High dwells not in places made with hands". @Acts 7:46 - 48. David says, "This is the house of the Lord God". @1 Chronicles 22:1. Jacob says, "This is none other", @Genesis 28:17 that is to say, there was a conclusion arrived at. Jacob typically says, 'This is nothing else than that', and it is the first mention of it, and it comes right down to us. He *named* the house of God. My point is to show that he came under discipline, and discipline stamped him; he was under reproach in that way all his life. He needed that. If we name things, and name them sincerely, and appreciate them, we must come under discipline in relation to them. God says He will bring us into the reality of that thing. Let us not shrink, for God has taken us in hand; we are to dwell in the house of God. Jacob does not see that. "That I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of Jehovah, and to inquire of him in his temple", @Psalm 27:4. What beautiful language the Spirit of God would put not only into our mouth, but into our heart. So discipline must proceed. All these things cannot be taken up in fleshly energy. We do not all get converted like Paul; we do not all get such a conversion as that, but all that is implied in that conversion must come to us sooner or later. So we may as well take on the obligation as we are here in the school of God. We must go to school. God has provided a school. It is imperative
{59}
to go to school. Luke in @Acts 19 alludes to the school of Tyrannus. This is not put there without having a meaning, it is stated there for a purpose, that is to say, the flesh will not be tolerated. That is a notice at the very outset, we may say, nor can we bring our distinction into it.
Well, Jacob returns from Padan, and he has got to meet the offended brother. It is no light matter to meet an offended brother, but the Lord gives instruction in @Matthew 5, "Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; leave there thy gift before the altar". @Matthew 5:23,24. Esau had something against Jacob. One day earlier he had decided that he would murder his brother, a terrible thought to have, but Esau had it. Now Jacob is coming back, and he is not sure if Esau has changed his mind, nor can he be sure. So he sends messengers to him. To our encouragement, two camps of angels had already met Jacob -- God's mighty angels, one of whom could slay one hundred and eighty five thousand at a stroke -- so we need not be afraid of meeting the offended brother; he cannot overcome us if we are with God. But Jacob did not take that in, nor did he rely upon it. Mahanaim means that. But Jacob did not send messengers to Esau saying, 'My dear brother Esau, God has just met me'. Instead of that he sent a message to tell Esau how well off he was, as much as to say, 'Esau, you have got somebody to reckon with'. But the point is he had God to reckon with. The Psalms are full of that; they never fall back on cattle and houses and money. The book of Psalms is intended to strengthen our hearts in dealing with our brethren. So there are two camps of angels on behalf of Jacob. Were Jacob to have taken this on, what would he do? He would have overcome evil by good. But Jacob was still relying on his own greatness. How ready we are to bring out in our
{60}
conversation with the brethren what we are, what our position is, what our education is. How prone we are to do it, so that the listener might be impressed that we are somebody, indeed, we intend it that he should be impressed. So the messengers came back and told Jacob that Esau is coming to meet him with four hundred men. Now that is something for Jacob to reckon with. But he was a true believer; immediately he turns to God. His prayer is given in this chapter, and when we come to the verses which we have read, he is left alone with God. Instead of Esau wrestling with him God does it. And Jacob says afterwards, "I have seen God face to face, and my life has been preserved". There you see the result of the discipline, dear brethren; he comes out with an increased knowledge of God, and with an increased sense of the weakness that is in himself. That is what he has learnt in God's school. So one could say, "For when I am weak, then am I strong". @2 Corinthians 12:10. The great learner, the most educated christian, was Paul. The Corinthians chided him, but he says, "I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified", @1 Corinthians 2:2 which meant that he accepted in his own body and demeanour that he was crucified with Christ. "I am crucified with Christ, and no longer live, *I*, but Christ lives in me; but in that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me", @Galatians 2:20. He is a full graduate of the school of God, not that discipline ever ceases; it goes on as long as we are in these bodies. "That the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us", @2 Corinthians 4:7. So Jacob limped over the brook; he was under reproach in men's eye, being crippled, but he was beautiful to God's eye. He is an outstanding example of education through discipline in relation to the house of God. What follows is a beautiful touch:
{61}
when Joseph and Rachel finally came before Esau, Joseph comes before Rachel. It reads, "And the maidservants drew near, they and their children ... And Leah also, with her children, drew near ... And lastly Joseph drew near, and Rachel". @Genesis 33:6,7. Joseph and Rachel: Christ first. That is another beautiful touch in the house of God. Make it a point of habit, make it a point of rule, dear brethren, Christ first! and more than that, Christ all, everything and in all! That is all I had to say about Jacob.
You know David takes up Jacob when he thought of building the house: "I will not give sleep to mine eyes, slumber to mine eyelids, until I find out a place for Jehovah, habitations for the Mighty One of Jacob", @Psalm 132:4 - 5. God said virtually, If that is to be true there must be excessive discipline. As the Lord said of Paul, "*I* will show to him how much he must suffer". @Acts 9:16. So David has to go through the school. This event in @1 Chronicles 21 is late in his life; he is a highly disciplined man already. It is a warning to us; we may have been going on for forty years, and yet we may be exposed to the devil. Let none of us think we are beyond discipline; our very thoughts expose us to the devil -- a little bit of pride, maybe, spiritual pride. David was an old brother. Old brothers are apt to think of the numbers in the meeting; they have had to do with this one's and with that one's conversions. We have been flattering ourselves that we have had to do with that. Do not let us be mistaken: Satan is in that. 'Go, number the people!' God said to the devil, 'Go and make David number the people'. You may be sure David had often thought of it. At that time Israel was a very powerful nation numerically. You know how modern rulers are counting their people. It is natural to men to do that. So God said to Satan, 'I allow him to number the people'. I do not know of anything more solemn: David the beloved
{62}
king, the great prophet, the sweet psalmist of Israel being allowed to give way to this temptation. How solemn that is. What a warning for us, dear brethren, that we should not be priding ourselves in our achievements. After all we are unprofitable servants. The Lord would put us in our places. Paul says, "That I might not be exalted ... there was given to me a thorn for the flesh, a messenger of Satan". @2 Corinthians 12:7. Who sent him? God. "That he might buffet me, that I might not be exalted". He asked the Lord thrice that it might depart from him, but the Lord said, 'No, My grace suffices thee'. Jacob's limp stayed; Paul's thorn stayed, and he is contented; his power increases as he is subject to the Lord in this matter.
Well, God is displeased at the numbering of the people, so that David is now in the position of discipline. The whole nation has been disciplined. The angel of God was standing over Jerusalem to destroy it. What a terrible sight that was -- the holy city about to be destroyed. Then you get that beautiful word, "The Lord beheld, and he repented". @1 Chronicles 21:15. He thought of Jerusalem, the city He had chosen. How touching that is. Then think of many of us, of any of us whom He has selected according to divine counsel. He sees us, He thinks of us when we are under discipline, and He repents. And when He repents He will leave a better christian, a better stone in the building. God sent the angel to Jerusalem to destroy it, and yet there is this beautiful touch, "He repented".. He sits as the refiner; He watches and watches, and relinquishes, and the fire ceases; He calms it down. "All things work together for good ... to those who are called according to purpose". @Romans 8:28. He had selected Jerusalem, and it repented God, and He said to the angel, 'Put that sword into its sheath', but not until David had brought the sacrifice (verse 27). There must be sacrifice; all His dealings
{63}
with us are in relation to the death of Christ. So David goes up and buys the place. He would not take anything for nothing to offer to God, he paid the full price, nor should we be behind that in principle. Whatever it costs let us not fail to meet God. David paid the full price. Then he built an altar. He judges himself. Let us judge ourselves unsparingly, there is to be no reservation in that matter. Heaven comes in and acknowledges David's offering. And we are told in the first verse of the next chapter, "And David said, This is the house of Jehovah Elohim, and this is the altar of burnt-offering for Israel". @1 Chronicles 22:1. This is a new order. The tabernacle was at Gibeon, but David would not go there. We must be careful and let God provide, but on the line of sovereign selection. David was accepted on that line. Let us be like him and pay the full price. I mean to say, let everything go that you may get the treasure, like the Lord Jesus, He restored that which He took not away. See how pleased God was with David here! Can we miss heaven's acknowledgment of this? Now we are ready for the house. David says, This *is* the house of God. He goes the whole way, he pays the full price: six hundred shekels of gold. That alludes to the great spiritual contribution David made. Heaven owns it.
Now just a word on our passage in Peter. Peter says, "The time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God". The house is not formed of merely professing christians, it is formed of real christians. The time is come that judgment must begin there. This includes much of what I have said already, but I only wanted to say about Peter how qualified he was to speak about the house; he says here, "The time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God". Obviously the meaning of this is that God is no respecter of persons: "If it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel?".
{64}
God is saying that there is no more licence for sin in a christian than in an ungodly person. Sin is sin before God -- as in the case of David, so in our case. If a christian's conduct discredits God, God will deal with him. There will come a terrible day, a solemn day: "For this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness". @2 Thessalonians 2:11,12. But judgment must begin at us. God is showing that He is no respecter of persons, He deals with sin as sin. The Corinthians were told, "On this account many among you are weak and infirm, and a good many are fallen asleep. But if we judged ourselves, so were we not judged". @1 Corinthians 11:30,31. Then the apostle adds, "But being judged, we are disciplined of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world". @1 Corinthians 11:32. Why did the Corinthians not deal with these things, but let them continue in the meeting as we see in chapter 11? It is inside, where our wills are often at work; it may be at the care meeting where we want a little bit of our own way. "On this account many among you are weak". @1 Corinthians 11:30. If we would judge ourselves we would not be condemned with the world. So you see at Corinth discipline is going on all the time. So with us it is going on continually. So that we are warned how to behave ourselves lest we should be condemned with the world.
{65}
THE SON IN AUTHORITY, LIBERTY AND PRIESTHOOD
@Colossians 1:12,13; @John 8:34 - 36; @Hebrews 7:28
J.T. What is in mind is to show how the Son of God is in His kingdom, then in the house, and then as priest particularly. We have a peculiar feature of the kingdom alluded to in Colossians, the kingdom of the Son of the Father's love. What is in mind is that we may see the peculiar influence of Christ in the kingdom as seen in this passage. There is authority in it, but qualified by the relation in which the One is who exercises the authority. The kingdom of God is presented under many designations; this is peculiarly attractive and the intent is that we might see, as coming under the rule of Christ as the Son, how we are secured in affections. The subjection is not arbitrary, but, as coming through such a relationship, it is intended to affect us, bearing on the spirit of sonship. So that we may consider the kingdom first, and then the house, and finally the priesthood; in all these positions and functions the Lord influences us, not in the way of subjugation, but in the promotion of affection, so that the word is, "Giving thanks to the Father, who has made us fit for sharing the portion of the saints in light, who has delivered us from the authority of darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love". It is the action of the Father, but the rule is in the hands of the Son of His love.
A.E.L. Does that correspond with @John 3:35 "The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand"?
J.T. I think it does -- "all things" would include the kingdom. The administration of the kingdom is perhaps as important as any of the features of Christ's administration.
{66}
Ques. Is it in keeping with David, who bowed the hearts of the men of Judah as one man?
J.T. You mean that David, in his communications to the men of Judah, appealed to their affections.
Ques. I thought it was that kind of authority -- is that so?
J.T. Quite so, and it was intended to be foreshadowed in Solomon more particularly, who was the son of his father's love; his word in the book of Proverbs to us is usually on the line of affection. Arbitrary means or measures have to be taken, of course: David represents that side more, for his ministry was subjugation, not extirpation but subjugation. Joshua's ministry was rather to extirpate the inhabitants of the land, denoting evil principles or evil spirits; nothing but the most arbitrary measures would meet that part of the service.
W.C. Would you say why fitness for the inheritance precedes the reference to the kingdom of the Son of His love?
J.T. As if the Father's work is needed to make us amenable to the beautiful administration of authority in the Son. Initially we need perhaps what is more arbitrary, so we have the kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of God, but for the kingdom of the Son of the Father's love to be effective certain preparatory operations from the Father seem to be required.
M.T. Is the thing seen in pattern on the mount of transfiguration: the Father's voice, "*This* is my beloved Son: hear him", @Mark 9:7, @Luke 9:35 and Moses and Elias being there in every sense equal to it, but the disciples perhaps having something else to learn?
J.T. I think that is good. The three disciples were taken up to see the Son of man coming in His kingdom, as it is in Matthew, or the kingdom of God come in power, as in Mark, or the kingdom of God
{67}
simply, as in Luke -- but what they saw and heard implied the kingdom of the Son of the Father's love.
Ques. Would the kingdom spoken of here bring us into the gain of the assembly, the way in which He is known in the assembly?
J.T. Well, the bearing of it is formation in us accompanying authority, affection allied with authority; the affections of the Son and all that enters into the relation of the Son, particularly the form of expression here -- the Son of the Father's love. The Son of the Father's love would mean the Son as apprehended in the different expressions of fatherly affection towards Him, which we have suggested at the banks of the Jordan and in such statements as the one which has just been referred to, "The Father loveth the Son". @John 3:35
M.P. What does "Has made us fit" involve? Is it a question of what is effected in the work of Christ, or of the Father's operations towards us in grace?
J.T. "Giving thanks to the Father, who has made us fit for sharing the portion of the saints in light". It is the Father's operations evidently, He has the Son in His mind. David, I think, helps; indeed, coming down and beginning with Abraham, we have indicated in type how the Father had the Son in mind. The journey to the land of Moriah on the part of Abraham and Isaac brings out the beautiful relations between the father and the son; the inter-change of thought between them brings out the relations and mutual affections that were there. Redemption in type accomplished as in @Genesis 22, then we have Abraham's exercise as to Isaac and the wife. Then we have between Jacob and Joseph also the relations and affections between the father and the son. And then in David, as I was remarking, what thoughtfulness there was on his part as the father so that Solomon's regime should be in
{68}
every way glorious, that the conditions should reflect all this ministry, the ministry of David; and I think here we see the culmination of it. @John 5 shows that the Son could do nothing except what He saw the Father doing -- remarkable statement! -- and the Father shows Him all things that He does. "The Father loves the Son", @John 3:35 so that it seems as if what is called attention to is the Father's thoughtfulness and provision for the Son in this rule, the kingdom of the Son of His love, to make it what it should be. And it is not always arbitrary assertion of authority, but the benign and ever-permeating influence of Christ amongst the people of God seen thus, and the Father's pleasure in all that.
Ques. Is the position seen in David's bringing Solomon forward in @1 Chronicles 29, where he says, "Solomon my son ... is young and tender", @1 Chronicles 29:1 he brings the people under that kind of influence? Is that what you had in mind?
J.T. Yes, his thought is Solomon. Of course, when Solomon is on the throne, he speaks of the people, how great they are, and he is there to serve them, but David is thinking about Solomon in view of the divine mind as to him. As he was born it was said that Jehovah loved him, and his kingdom must be all it should be. I think that is the relation of the Father here: He has, as it says, "made us fit for sharing the portion of the saints in light, who has delivered us from the authority of darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love". I think you see how the Father has the Son in mind in this and how interested He is in the rule of the Son; He loves the Son and has given all things into His hand; but here it is the Son of His love, not simply that He loves Him, and we are translated into it as made fit for sharing the portion of the saints in light.
{69}
R.L. Snr. Would you say, with regard to this fitness, when it takes place as to us?
J.T. Well, it fits in with Colossians, which epistle contemplates a certain work in the people of God -- the Father's part in it. Romans teaches that Christ is raised from the dead by the glory of the Father -- a remarkable statement! -- and that the saints are in mind; they are the extension of that, as I understand, the Father operating so that all in the kingdom should be in keeping; the glory of such a kingdom should shine, the Father having His part in it.
R.W. Would it be helpful to notice that this epistle is addressed to "the holy and faithful brethren in Christ"? @Colossians 1:1.
J.T. Yes, they are viewed as the subjects of the work of God and that statement shows it, and then that they had love for all the saints: verse 3 says, "We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ continually when praying for you, having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and the love which ye have towards all the saints". @Colossians 1:3,4. And moreover it says, "On account of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens; of which ye heard before in the word of the truth of the glad tidings, which are come to you, as they are in all the world, and are bearing fruit and growing, even as also among you, from the day ye heard them and knew indeed the grace of God, in truth". @Colossians 1:5,6. So that we have clear evidence that the work of God had been effective in these christians, and it is included in the statement we have read that the Father "has made us fit for sharing the portion of the saints in light". Such saints are equal to that, sharing the portion of the saints in light and delivered from the authority of darkness, which alludes evidently to Satan's peculiar workings, the workings of man's mind in the way of doctrines and principles that carry authority with them. It is a terrible thought
{70}
that people are restful in such darkness, because they think the things they hold are right and authoritative as coming from certain sources. The Father has operated to take us out of all that and translate us into the kingdom of the Son of His love.
R.L. Snr. Is the thought of 'Father' closely connected with the work of God in us?
J.T. Well, it is; here it is evidently in view of the Son. The Father works in us on His own account and on our account too, but He works in us in relation to the Son, as we saw in Abraham and David, the Son of His love; we are translated into His kingdom.
R.E. Would what the Lord says, "Thine they were, and thou gavest them me" @John 17:6 connect with it?
J.T. It would; it is perhaps a little further than this, but it is the same thought. You quote from @John 17; in chapter 6 of that gospel the Lord says, "No one can come to me except the Father who has sent me draw him" @John 6:44 and "Him that comes to me I will not at all cast out"; @John 6:37 it brings out the great matter of the Father and the Son operating, the Father operating in view of the Son, and, on the other hand, the Son operating in view of the Father. They operate in us too in view of ourselves, but They operate in us in relation to One another, and this thought of the kingdom of the Son of the Father's love is a most attractive one, for it is a question of Themselves and how we are affected by the Father in view of this peculiar feature of the kingdom..
A.A. That makes clear what was asked just now in regard to Christ's death and the sovereign operations of the Father. Will not the Lord Jesus take account of every one moving towards Him as being the subject of the Father's work and value him accordingly?
{71}
J.T. I think we ought to see that the Father and Son operate in view of Themselves and the Spirit operates in the same sense, the Spirit viewed as the Spirit of adoption which we have received; but that Spirit cries "Abba, Father", as much as to say, you are in relation to the Father. That sets me up in a system of affection.
W.G. Would this thought of the kingdom be provisional or would it carry our thoughts on to what is abiding connected with Christ as Head in the Colossian setting?
J.T. I think it runs on into eternity. @1 Corinthians 15 teaches us that the Lord Jesus subdues all and then becomes subject Himself; the principle of rule runs through particularly as seen in this setting of the kingdom, love. We read in 2 Peter, "So an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ". @2 Peter 1:11.
A.W. God has such a people for His pleasure.
J.T. Well, He has, and in this particular relation. I think if we follow the thought of the father and the son in the types we shall get help as to how they move in relation to one another, even as regards the kingdom and how David had Solomon in mind: at his birth it is said Jehovah loved him and he is called Jedidiah prophetically. Well, David would never lose sight of that; earlier he had been told by Jehovah that there would be a son and that He would take him on as His son, and as soon as he is born Jehovah indicates that He loves him, and he is the object in all that follows. It is not simply that Israel is to have a wonderful ruler, but Solomon is to be glorified; typically the Father and the Son are to have delight, they are to have pleasure, in this state of things.
A.M.P. Were you thinking the book of Proverbs opens that up?
{72}
J.T. I think it does, I think it is peculiarly intended for young christians, to get their souls bathed in the affections that flow out from the Son of the Father's love. It is peculiarly a setting of love, an order of things marked by love, and yet there is authority in it.
A.M.P. David had said "my son" of Solomon, and then Solomon carries on the thought and says, "My son, give me thine heart". @Proverbs 23:26.
J.T. It is very striking the frequency of those terms in the book of Proverbs, even from the king's mother in the last chapter: he was tender and beloved in the sight of his mother; while Colossians contemplates the Father operating in relation to the Son with regard to us, the state of the saints warranting and affording opportunity for this. As we progress in the knowledge of God, we see that, though we are in mind in the operations, it is really a matter between divine Persons; the whole matter is between divine Persons.
Ques. Would not that bring out the thought we have before us in connection with being translated into the kingdom of the Son of His love, and be a wholly spiritual thought?
J.T. It is a spiritual thought: the Father has done it. What a remarkable thing it is that the Father has done it with each of us; and then in @John 8 the Lord in dealing with some of the Jews who believed on Him brings in this thought, "If therefore the Son shall set you free, ye shall be really free" @John 8:36 because He abides in the house. It is still a matter between the Father and the Son; the Son abides in the house. You may say, 'It is His own right'. It is, but then it is the Father's matter, it is the Father's thought that He is to be there, and if He sets us free, we are indeed free. Now it is not simply authority in the kingdom but in the house, and what service the Son
{73}
renders to us so that we should enjoy the real freedom!
C.S. Would it fit in with @1 Chronicles 22: "David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying, Is not the Lord your God with you? and hath he not given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the Lord, and before his people. Now set your heart and your soul to seek the Lord your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the Lord God"? @1 Chronicles 22:17 - 19. David is thinking of Solomon there.
J.T. Yes, he is thinking of Solomon all through those chapters; hence we find the people making Solomon king the second time (@1 Chronicles 29:22), they had come to like him. The father's operations are to that end; they made him king the second time, meaning they were satisfied with his rule.
N.K.M. It speaks of him there as "Solomon the son of David". @1 Chronicles 29:22.
J.T. David was, of course, predominant, and he operated to make Solomon what he should be, and now the people like him. They would not have any other; they made him king a second time. David had made him king but the people are making him king too.
N.K.M. In regard to the inheritance, why does it say "the Father ... has made us fit for sharing the portion of the saints in light"? What is the force of those words, "in light"?
J.T. I think it would be peculiarly Colossian. They were in danger of philosophy, which would be darkness, but up to the present day Greek philosophy is regarded as light even by nominal christians, and ceremonialism too is regarded as light, and devoted people are going on with those two things and regarding them as light, whereas they are darkness; these things are darkening.
{74}
R.W. Would it be helpful to notice that in the gospel of Mark, the Father says, "Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased"? @Mark 1:11. You have been speaking of the kingdom of the Son of His love, and He seems to be addressed in a personal way in Mark's gospel.
J.T. Quite so. Those around Him are addressed elsewhere, "This is my beloved Son", but here He is addressed Himself. One might say, Why should it be addressed to Jesus? He knew what He was. But there it is; the Father loves the Son, and He loves to tell Him so -- "Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased". Well now, the Father hands over all these people to Christ; He has taken us from under the authority of darkness and has handed us over to Him, and the Lord Himself says of us, "The men whom thou gavest me", @John 17:6 so that it is the Father and the Son we see in all this.
Now in @John 8 the Jews said to the Lord, "We are Abraham's seed, and have never been under bondage to anyone; how sayest thou, Ye shall become free? Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Every one that practises sin is the bondman of sin. Now the bondman abides not in the house for ever; the son abides for ever. If therefore the Son shall set you free, ye shall be really free". The Son abides in the house for ever; the house is God's house. Any son's place is in his father's house, and the Lord takes that place here. He is there for ever so He sets us really free.
A.A. On the side of our apprehension of this, I would like to ask if what you quoted in @John 8 is subsequent to what we have in Colossians? In Colossians, our entering into and enjoying that means this, the giving of thanks to the Father; is the Son's setting us free, and our acceptance of it subsequent to that, in the house?
{75}
J.T. Well, the order is the kingdom and then the house, the Son in both cases; the one makes for the other. The truth is mentioned before, "Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free", @John 8:32 that is how we come into deliverance. Before we come to persons the truth becomes operative, but it leads to the house where it is a question of persons, and particularly the Son, the Son abiding there for ever, bringing out the character or nature of the relation of sonship.
Ques. Do you regard the expression, "the son abides for ever", as characteristic and therefore applicable to the saints as in the house?
J.T. I think so. It really means, in the working out of it, that we are made sons; that is Galatian truth, but the Son does it.
Ques. Does the same truth come out in @Hebrews 3 where Christ is contrasted with Moses who is said to be faithful in all his house as a servant; Christ is Son over God's house, and then the saints are said to be the house, "Whose house are we"? @Hebrews 3:6.
J.T. That is right, only there it is the Son over it: Moses is a servant in the house, Christ is Son over it. The point is He abides in it, a permanent thing, and really we are brought into this liberty by the Spirit of adoption.
W.C. Is the contrast between Isaac and Ishmael?
J.T. Quite so. Ishmael did not abide in the house; although he was Abraham's son, he was not a son characteristically.
W.C. Is the bondman here the product of a legal system, and, on the other hand, the free woman a question of coming under Christ as the Son?
J.T. Quite so, we see His readiness to use any opportunity to deliver souls. Even if it is a question of a man under the power of sin, the thing is the Son abides in the house, and He can deliver him from that.
{76}
M.P. Mephibosheth was given a place as one of the king's sons.
J.T. That is a very good illustration of what we have said; it is like the spirit of adoption.
A.W. What have you in mind in reference to the expression, "Ye shall be free indeed"?
J.T. Well, it is real freedom -- permanent freedom. The abiding in the house for ever is the thought, there is no possibility of ever being cast out. Ishmael had no status at all, his position was precarious, and, as he shows his hostility to the son, to Isaac, he is cast out. It is the position of the Jew really in the chapter; they have shown hostility to the Son and He abides in the house for ever, and they are cast out.
A.W. Would you say it brings out the line of sonship you referred to just now?
J.T. The Son setting us free involves His making us sons, having the Spirit of adoption, otherwise we would not be there for ever. It is to bring out the economy in which we are seen here in the house; we have already spoken of the kingdom, but now it is the house; no other than the Son has an abiding place there.
G.F. Does God give us the Spirit of adoption that we might be at home there?
J.T. Yes, the Spirit of adoption gives us the feelings suitable; the word in @Galatians 4:6 is "because ye are sons". In verse 5 it had said, "That we might receive sonship" @Galatians 4:5,6 -- that is His mind about us in Christ.
Ques. Do you mean when the glory filled the house the sons would be at perfect liberty, at home?
J.T. Quite so, and however great the glory, they are equal to it. So in @2 Chronicles 5 the glory entered the house and the priests could not minister, but that does not mean in the type that the sons could not remain there; they are equal to the glory.
{77}
Priesthood is only a type; sonship is a family relationship, and no glory in the economy is great enough to shut them out. God dwells in light unapproachable, but in the economy there is no glory too great for the sons; they are equal to it. And, as you are remarking, sonship is received: "That we might receive sonship"; @Galatians 4:5 that is light. That is to say, the mind of God is that we should be sons. "Ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus" @Galatians 3:26 -- that is the mind of God, but the Spirit in us makes us suitable. The acceptance of the position is not enough; the Spirit of adoption makes me consciously a son. We have been speaking of the thought of Father, that the relationship of Father and Son does not necessitate the death of Christ; it was introduced unconditionally: "This is my beloved Son", and "Thou art my beloved Son". There is no condition attaching to it, and we are brought into that; redemption had to be accomplished in order that we should be brought into it, but the relationship itself is a question of eternal counsels; and the son abides in the house for ever, he is not only a son in name, but in consciousness in the Spirit of adoption. The more we take that in the better, that there is no fear or anxiety at all of ever being rejected; we abide in the house for ever.
A.A. Does that greatly add to our service? You have been speaking of the service of the assembly a good deal; does the apprehension of what you have been saying impart a tone and lustre to our assembly service, as we speak of it, to the Father and to God?
J.T. It does, I am at liberty, I have not a shade of uncertainty, I am as near as Christ is -- as He is, so am I. The more we take it in the better and the more effective our service.
Ques. Would the Son have to do with each one of us as in the house to bring us into the liberty that is His?
{78}
J.T. I think so. Take Paul; he says, "The Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me", @Galatians 2:20 and in that He has taken me into sonship; it is by faith in Christ Jesus. Some may think it is by faith simply, but it is by faith *in Christ Jesus*. "Ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus". @Galatians 3:26. But then faith gives the light of the thing; the Spirit of adoption involves the feelings proper to it, that I am as really a son as Christ is.
W.F. Is it the work of the Son to bring us into the gain of sonship? It says, "If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be indeed free".
J.T. That is what He is doing all the time. Paul says, He "loved me and gave himself for me"; @Galatians 2:20 it is an individual transaction. It is very wonderful! He is carrying on other things too for us, but that is the thing to bring us into the state that answers to the counsels of God.
R.E. Would @Hebrews 2 help in connection with the thought of "bringing many sons to glory"? @Hebrews 2:10.
J.T. Well, there it is God is doing it. "It became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make perfect the leader of their salvation through sufferings". @Hebrews 2:10. That is, He is the leader, He is the One who sets this thing out -- the word means that He is the thing, "perfect", meaning He has taken on an order of humanity we can have part in. That is what He is doing; He is our leader in this matter and He has taken each of us up to bring us to it, because it is the divine mind; the counsels of God are involved in it.
M.P. Would the thought of training come in there? "He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the length", @Proverbs 29:21. Is it the thought of training under the hand of Christ?
{79}
J.T. That is very good. The Lord is working at us all the time. The discipline spoken of in @Hebrews 12 has it in mind, of course.
J.S. I suppose the Lord was carrying out this work in Peter when He said, "Then are the sons free".
J.T. That is it. Matthew has it in mind, as He comes down from the mountain. It is a question of personality in Matthew, and that meant, as the Lord says, "That take, and give unto them for me and thee": @Matthew 17:27 it is association with Christ in sonship.
Ques. Does taking on the Spirit of Christ in adoption depend on being under the influence of the Son?
J.T. One may come in as a child or even as a servant, but you come into sonship; He has nothing less before Him than that.
W.S. Is it suggested in what the Lord says to Moses, "Israel is my son, my firstborn ... Let my son go, that he may serve me", @Exodus 4:23 before the blood of the paschal lamb was shed?
J.T. That is the thing, it took centuries to work it out, for really it was not reached till Solomon's time: Solomon was the son. The great service of God, the culminating thought, is in the Son, and that is the meaning of @2 Chronicles 5.
Ques. Is that why, at the end of Chronicles, they were to sanctify themselves according to the writings of David and Solomon his son, and to put the holy ark in the house of Solomon the son of David; as though that is what God had in mind in a day of recovery? Is not that the principle?
J.T. Quite so. He speaks there of the holy ark which should be in its place. It says in chapter 34: "The king stood in his place". @2 Chronicles 34:31 The ark evidently was taken out of its place, and then the priests are sanctified and in their place, the singers in their place, the doorkeepers in their place. So you have
{80}
praise the like of which was not heard since the days of Samuel, showing that sonship underlies all these things.
R.W. Have you in mind the Lord's present service in relation to His own with regard to the freedom you have referred to in @John 8? I was thinking of @Luke 22, and the Lord's service to His own there.
J.T. Quite so, it is the dignity of the position now. In Josiah's time what was stressed was that everything was right; it is not only authority, but, as one might say; there is the refinement of feeling that belongs to the service of God, so there must not be anything out of place. We can see how the Lord is bringing us back to sonship. Many have not much thought of what God is doing, what He is calling attention to, how He is bringing in His people, and how, under the rule and service of the Son, everything must be right; it is not arbitrary, it is obviously necessary; everything must be in its place under Josiah. In the passover under Hezekiah they had to get a month's grace, the second month instead of the first month; things were not up to the mark and Hezekiah said, "The good Lord pardon every one". @2 Chronicles 30:18. The Lord has to pardon a good deal that is amongst us, but the great thought is perfection, "Let us go on unto perfection". @Hebrews 6:1. We shall see in regard to priesthood that Christ's work enters into perfection, not in any personal sense but in regard to what is needed by us; everything must flow out of what answers to the counsels of God. So Josiah is the model; the king is in his place and the ark and the Levites and the singers and the doorkeepers in their places; and then the Spirit of God says, "There was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet". @2 Chronicles 35:18. It is a question of the kind of passover, how everything was right. People say, That is a minor matter, whether we have two cups or four; but the record as to Josiah's passover is to show us
{81}
that we must pay attention to details. As in any well-ordered house, things must be right, and they are right under sonship.
R.E. Do I gather that that is particularly connected with the kingdom, or does the house also come into it?
J.T. I am speaking of the house particularly, but then the king was in his place, meaning the background was the kingdom, and that is the point. If we are translated into the kingdom of the Son of the Father's love, the first thing is the house and the next thing is the priesthood. So in the passage we read, "For the law constitutes men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the swearing of the oath which is after the law, a Son perfected for ever". He is the Minister of the sanctuary, as the next verses tell us, He is a Son perfected for ever. It is a question of what He is as a Man, He is the Son and the service of God is in His hands, and everything is perfect.
Ques. Referring again to Josiah, they are enjoined to stand in the sanctuary, does that fit in with your last scripture?
J.T. I think it does, it is the proper place of service. The Lord is seen standing in resurrection, particularly in Luke and John; it is a question of the service of God now, we are ready for it; He is bringing the saints into it. Forty days were needed to make them spiritual, but, as going into heaven, according to the beginning of Hebrews, He is set down there and He is the Minister of the sanctuary: the service is to go on.
{82}
DIVINE ENDS REACHED AS THE LORD COMES IN
@Luke 1:8 - 13; @Luke 24:36 - 49
J.T. Other scriptures will need to be looked into about our subject. The leading thought in mind is that Luke would show that divine ends, especially assembly service, can only be reached as the Lord comes in and takes part. We have noticed that Zacharias was occupied with his service, which was, according to the order of his course, to burn incense; it says, "All the multitude of the people were praying without at the hour of incense", as if the great thought of the altar and prayer could only become effective as the angel came in, "standing on the right of the altar of incense". He came in in regard of what was there, he appeared to Zacharias, but at the right of the altar of incense, that is, in relation to what was going on; and the Lord, in the last chapter, is seen standing in their midst. The saints had been gathered and were speaking; they had begun, but obviously from the verses read they could not reach an end according to God had not the Lord stood in their midst. It does not say in this particular case that He came -- John says He came, "Then came Jesus" @John 20:26; that is, the condition, well known to the Lord, hardly warranted the thought of His coming; His place is standing in their midst. The word 'came' in John involves certain conditions to be more in keeping with the Lord. Brethren will remember the wording in @John 20:19 - 21, "When therefore it was evening on that day, which was the first day of the week, and the doors shut where the disciples were, through fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and says to them, Peace be to you". There is nothing said of any activity or speaking on their part; the Lord evidently came in relation to the state that was there, which would mean the
{83}
condition was suitable. Here it would seem that it is the concrete condition He had in mind; they had already begun speaking, and, although what was being said was suitable so far, their state did not agree wholly with what they were saying, so that the word 'came' is omitted and the Lord is just said to stand there Himself and it is in *their* midst -- the persons that were present: whereas in John it is *the* midst, having a wider bearing evidently. It is as if we cannot go on to the wider thought, the universal spiritual side of the assembly condition, apart from the local concrete condition, the state of the saints -- "As they were saying these things", it says, "he himself stood in their midst": in John's account it is "Jesus came".
Ques. Do you get the same principle in @John 12? It says Jesus came to Bethany; but in Matthew it is, "Being in Bethany, in Simon the leper's house". @Matthew 26:6 Is that the same thing in another setting?
J.T. I think that is good. It is very likely Luke and John record the same events, and so do John and Matthew record the same events. It is very likely that it was what Matthew records without mentioning Mary's anointing, and that it occurred at the same time; but anyway John gives you the state that was evidently agreeable and wholly suitable to the Lord.
P.L. Does the coming suggest attraction, that there is affinity of mind with the Lord as with Mary of Bethany; and does the other suggest the Lord condescending in compassionate service on His own initiative to meet conditions?
J.T. Yes, as if there can be nothing at all if He does not. It reminds us that, although we may be saying the right things, the divine end cannot be reached without the Lord.
P.L. Would the first thought be priesthood, what John speaks of -- the minister of the sanctuary?
{84}
J.T. It would be more that perhaps. It is a wider thought in John, I think: "the midst" is spiritually a wider thought than "their midst". It is "their midst" in Luke, as if the Lord would say, I am not ignoring local conditions. They were not restful.
W.C. Would the principle be in @Joshua 5, where it says, "There stood a man over against him", @Joshua 5:13 and then the Lord says, "As captain of the host of the Lord am I now come" @Joshua 5 :14 -- that is in conflict, but would the principle be there?
J.T. I think it would, "Am I now come", the allusion, I suppose, would be to what had preceded as to the requirements in the land, circumcision and so on. "Am I now come" -- He would take charge of such a host; it would now be recognised as Jehovah's host.
W.C. Would you say a little as to how we might discern the Lord's arrival in this way as we are together?
J.T. We have first the thought mentioned in regard to Gabriel in chapter 1; then we see it more clearly in chapter 24. Zacharias was carrying on; the order was right. He had already prayed and the angel alludes to the fact that his supplications had been heard, but he was unbelieving. The angel stands at the right of the altar of incense; prayer is going on. It says, "All the multitude of the people were praying without at the hour of incense", and the angel of the Lord appears to him standing on the right of the altar of incense; as much as to say, 'The prayers will be effective and can only be effective by my being here'. And Zacharias was troubled, but the angel said to him, "Fear not, Zacharias, because thy supplication has been heard", and so on; and he questions what the angel says, and the angel says, "I am Gabriel" -- he announces who it is that has come, "who stand before God, and I have been sent to speak to thee, and to bring these glad tidings to thee; and behold, thou shalt be silent and not able to speak, till the day in which these things shall take place, because thou hast not believed my words, the which shall be fulfilled in their time". @Luke 1:19,20.
{85}
It seems to me that the point is that there had been prayers and there were prayers, and that the angel standing at the right in regard of what is on hand is to make all effective, that there might be real results, but the state forbade it; at least the state was not in keeping with the opportunity, and so discipline had to come in in the case of Zacharias. Now in chapter 24 the Lord stood there too, the service was going on, so to say, they were saying the right things so far, but the state was not right; and not only that, but the Lord was intimating that He is taking account of the service so far, that what they were doing and saying was quite right, but he says, 'You must have Me, and I am here to serve', because He is standing, not that *He came* and stood, but He Himself stood there in their midst, among them, to do what was needful.
C.H. Had you in mind that the service must go on, and so with the saints together in chapter 24 the service was beyond the state?
J.T. Well, they were saying right things in both cases; outwardly they were right, and it would seem as if the Lord is honouring what they are saying; indeed the angel too coming in chapter 1 is honouring what was there, for it is a question of the altar of incense, that is to say, a question of real results being reached according to God, and he is at the right of the altar of incense. The Lord standing, according to chapter 24, was in the same sense; He was there to make effective according to God all that entered into the position -- He stood there. It is not that He came complacently, that is not the point; He stood in their midst, as if to say, 'I am there in relation to you. There is a great deal enters into this, but I am in *your* midst knowing every one of
{86}
you abstractly'. In John it is the abstract thought, the saints, as having the Spirit and gathered according to God are abstractly according to His mind, but then the local concrete condition cannot be passed over, and there is no use in proceeding unless we accept the actual local condition.
Rem. So that in Luke we find them confounded and frightened when they see the Lord.
J.T. Yes, they were not really equal to the position. The position itself is right, and the two that left Emmaus and found the eleven and those with them were right. In fact they confirmed the position that it was right, the saints there were the ones that should be there and what they were saying, so far, was right; but they were not equal to the position and all that entered into it.
Rem. In John the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord.
J.T. Yes, that is the abstract thought, which we may come to later. Our position, the position of the brethren today, coming together to break bread, is right, it is as right as the position was at Troas, and, being right, all the divine mind enters into it as to the assembly; it is God's assembly, in that sense, and the mind of God enters into it; and the Lord is ready; He comes in in relation to what we are abstractly according to John and as complacent in it from that point of view. But, according to Luke, He cannot pass over the local condition, and He does not come, as it were complacently; He just stands there: "He himself stood in their midst", @Luke 24:36 that is the local position.
P.L. Is it the difference between the glory appearing at the door of the tabernacle in various crises, often where the state was unsuitable, and the glory filling the house, where all is complacent?
J.T. That is good, I am sure. The glory did appear and left immediately; it appeared too to correct,
{87}
but in the end of Exodus and @2 Chronicles 5, it came in complacently to take the whole position over in each case. We have to wait and see now. If the Lord is just standing there Himself and says, Peace, He has nothing else in His mind for us but peace; still, His presence will bring out what is there; it is sure to bring out what is there.
Rem. Not in view of our being hindered from going forward, but that we might be helped to go on to God's end.
J.T. That is the thought. He is ready to do what is necessary, but the divine end is in His mind. In chapter 22 He condescends to have preparations made for His coming. They eat the passover; He does not come to them as they begin but as they proceed. But the ground is changed at that point, He institutes the Supper and that is their matter; they are to come together to break bread; that is their matter, so that He comes in as they are proceeding, not at the beginning.
Ques. Will you say a word as to the Lord's question, "Why are thoughts rising in your hearts?" @Luke 24:38. What kind of thoughts would they be?
J.T. They would not be like the living water springing up into everlasting life.
Ques. Something out of the control of the Spirit, you mean?
J.T. Yes, just so, adverse or extraneous things. Why are they arising? If these thoughts are arising you will not make a way for the Lord. John the baptist's ministry was to make a way for the Lord, and when Abraham set the pieces over against each other he intended to make a way for the Lord to come in. He put piece against piece of the creatures he slew under the Lord's direction in @Genesis 15 and the fowls of the air came down; they would hinder all that, and Abraham scares them away. There was not that power here. These thoughts are loose lawless
{88}
kinds of things without control, arising in our hearts, and it is very common with us that these foreign thoughts become rampant instead of being under control. The apostle says, "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law" @Romans 7:25 -- these thoughts are not according to God's law.
H.B. Would it be a matter of faith, even if the condition is low, to recognise that the Lord is with us and to seek to hear His voice and prove His power?
J.T. I think so. Why are these thoughts arising in your heart? @Romans 7 would teach us to control ourselves. This thought cannot be right, you say, I disallow it, it is like a fowl coming down, foreign elements disturbing the conditions; they prevent the Lord coming in. These thoughts must not be allowed scope. The thing is to make a way for the Lord, He is on the way, He is not sitting but standing and these thoughts arising block His way.
W.C. Do these thoughts reflect back on what we may have been occupied with during the six days of the week?
J.T. I think so. We ought to habituate ourselves to control. "If, by the Spirit, ye put to death the deeds of the body" @Romans 8:13 -- that is the principle. The point reached at the end of @Romans 7 is that I resolve with the mind to keep God's law, whatever it may be; it is not specified there. If I accustom myself to that, when sitting down in assembly I will not allow these foreign thoughts to be rampant, blocking the Lord's way. It says here, "But they, being confounded and being frightened, supposed they beheld a spirit. And he said to them, Why are ye troubled? and why are; thoughts rising in your hearts?"
W.C. You were alluding to birds just now; would it be illustrated in the raven and the dove in the ark? It is a question which bird, so to speak, we are identified with, whether we are identified with
{89}
the Holy Spirit. It says, "The mind of the flesh is death" -- that would be the raven, I suppose -- "but the mind of the Spirit life and peace". @Romans 8:6.
J.T. I think that is good. There is a beautiful link between the dove and Noah; he took her unto him into the ark. She found no resting-place for her foot and came back to Noah. These thoughts the Lord alludes to here, I am sure, and they hinder our meetings if they are allowed; they are not to be allowed, they are to be under control. Why are they arising in our hearts?
Ques. Is the principle exemplified in @Exodus 34, when Jehovah instructed Moses to be ready for the morning, to hew for himself two tables? He seems to be ready for divine communications, and it says Jehovah came down and stood before him there. Is that the principle of a man serving the law of God, being under divine control and ready for a divine manifestation?
J.T. I think that is good, he is in entire keeping with the position, the Lord passing before him announced who and what He is; that is, there was a way for the Lord. John the baptist made a way for the Lord, so that, if He came in, the point, I suppose, would be here that there should be a way for Him; instead of that, He finds confusion, they are troubled and these unbelieving thoughts are rampant.
C.H. @John 20 says, "The doors being shut". @John 20:26 Does that come in in this connection? You are speaking of the mind and control of what is inward.
J.T. It does indeed; they took care of that. The doors would be the doors of our hearts, as has often been pointed out. It is not 'door', it is not the idea of a room entrance through which each of us comes; the idea is a spiritual one, the doors of our hearts are in mind; that is, the disciples are viewed there abstractly, I believe, in the light of the message the
{90}
Lord had sent to them; Mary had come and told them these things, she said she had seen the Lord and that He had spoken these things to her. It would seem as if their hearts treasured the message and they did not want Him disturbed. It was where the disciples were, and then it says, "Jesus came and stood in the midst". @John 20:26.
C.H. I wondered if the allusion to the Jews would suggest the concern that was with them lest that which was merely outward should be a hindrance.
J.T. Yes, if the Jews got in they would block the Lord's way; that is the idea of legality, to block the divine way. The Jewish element shuts the Lord out; it is incompatible with the heavenly calling, so that, if the Lord came in as He did there, it would be in relation to the heavenly call, the message He sent before.
A.B. Is it very like @John 14, "Let not your heart be troubled" @John 14:27,28 and then, "I am coming to you"?
J.T. Yes, one might suggest reading a verse from @John 14, for it enters into this matter. The Lord said, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you" @John 14:18 -- that follows the announcement that He would send the Spirit; it is contingent on the presence of the Spirit here. It is the Spirit that is needed to make a way for the Lord; the Spirit is the medium through which He comes, and @John 14 contemplates that the Spirit would be there, and consequent upon that, He would come.
Ques. I would like to ask, in regard of these verses, how the Lord waits on the saints, whether it would suggest we should give time to conserve the actual impression the Lord may give us at the Supper, and not be in too much of a hurry to move away from it?
J.T. I think that is good. Room should be given to Him too to adjust our thoughts as to what enters into the Supper, the idea of the assembly in its relation
{91}
to Him and His relation to it. So, after the Supper is finished, I believe the Lord would take occasion to enlarge our view as to the assembly's relation to Him and His to her. I was thinking today that in Exodus, before the actual service of God is entered upon, Moses¬ wife returns to him; she had been away and her father brings her back with the children. I believe that there is a touch in it as to the service of God, that Christ and the assembly are in mind in a pre-eminent way. The idea of the bride really, as you might say, originated with the Father; that is, this condition is the relation which He had in mind, and it is not only for the satisfaction of Christ, but for the satisfaction of God. It was God that said, "It is not good that Man should be alone" @Genesis 2:18, and He evidently had pleasure in the relation formed between Adam and Eve. Then in the next great type of the assembly, that is Rebecca, we find the same thing, that the father is concerned about the son having his bride; he is seen as alone in the field meditating, but Sarah's tent is unoccupied; that would be Israel's position, involving the service of God. So Abraham is greatly concerned as to the bride Isaac is to have and that the nuptials should be in relation to the heavenly side of the position -- Isaac does not come down from the mount, according to the facts mentioned. Abraham's servant came down from Beer-sheba, as if it is a heavenly matter now, and then there is concern that the wife should be of his order, of his family, so that the scene is filled out in that way as originating with the Father. And now, in Moses¬ case, when the service is about to be inaugurated, we have the wife brought back by her father in @Exodus 18; the Spirit is seen typically in chapter 17. We have indeed Joshua introduced in chapter 17 and then Zipporah is brought back in chapter 18, and chapter 19 begins the service of God, because it was to be on that mountain, that is
{92}
where the service was to begin. We ought to make room for Christ in the assembly, ample room, because it involves union, and it involves our most intimate relations with Christ and gives Him scope as to material in answering to the Father, in answering to God in His service. What do you say about that?
P.L. Your point is that what is obviously in union with Christ would be sensitive to His quickening power as Head in relation to the service of God?
J.T. I think it enriches it, speaking reverently; the Lord is capable of being affected Himself: "Jesus rejoiced in spirit", @Luke 10:21 we are told, at a certain time, and it was in relation to the saints. He had already said, "Your names are written in heaven", @Luke 10:20 and He rejoiced in spirit, and proceeded to speak to them about the Father and about Himself. "No one knows who the Son is but the Father, and who the Father is but the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son is pleased to reveal him", @Luke 10:22. And then He turns to His disciples, as if they were now in His mind. It seems to me that, unless we make full room for the assembly, we have incompleteness in the position. The completion of the divine mind is the wife, the divine mind in man is the wife; we see that in Genesis.
P.L. @John 12 emphasises that; He has something for His own heart in Bethany.
J.T. You can see how He reached something. I suppose it is the Jewish position in the beginning of chapter 12 in Bethany, but still He reached a definite end, so that there is completion there so far. Then there is something more in chapter 13, because He says, "Unless I wash thee, thou hast not part with me", @John 13:8 but He wants to carry the saints along with Him, and we know that Paul's ministry coming in adds the great divine thought, it was the full bringing out of the divine mind; Christ is "head over all things to the assembly, which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all". @Ephesians 1:22.
{93}
It is the bringing out of the divine mind, and Paul introduces the Lord's supper as he does, receiving it directly from the Lord in heaven. These facts would convey to us that we must make full room for Christ in the assembly, the assembly viewed as His bride.
Ques. Would you say that, whilst the nuptials belong to the heavenly side, @Exodus 18 suggests the wilderness at the moment?
J.T. That would be the thought of the Lord's supper -- sitting down in that way.
Rem. Yes. I was thinking of that, for it mentions definitely that Moses took his sons and his wife into the wilderness, as if that was a great incentive to move to the heavenly side.
J.T. Then in the Song of Songs we have, "Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved?". @Song of Songs 8:5 It is Christ and the assembly, and now there is moving forward both in Christ and in the saints, speaking reverently. I believe there is great perfection and glory shining in affection.
W.C. Would the allusion in @Exodus 2 to Moses being forgotten by the daughters of Reuel after serving them indicate the tendency with us to forget the Lord? Reuel says, "Where is he? why then have ye left the man behind?" @Exodus 2:20.
J.T. Quite so, they had not considered for him.
W.C. Is there in your allusion to chapter 18 the thought of recovery? Apparently Zipporah is subject now; we do not hear more of her.
J.T. I think Jethro is remarkable -- carrying forward the thought. Moses is content to dwell with the man. You might say, Because he was going to marry his daughter, but that is not the point. It is the kind of man Moses was; he was content to dwell in circumstances unpleasant naturally, he was a subject man, subject to God, and that finds its full answer
{94}
in Christ, what He accepted here. Now, the deliverance of the people having come about, her father brings her to Moses in the wilderness, as if to fill out the position before he enters on the service of God which had been spoken of earlier. That was the great thought in the mind of God, "Ye shall serve God upon this mountain" @Exodus 3:12 -- but before the service begins the wife is brought to him.
P.L. So you have what you have alluded to as personality, "I, thy father-in-law Jethro, am come to thee". @Exodus 18:6.
J.T. That is very good. It brings out the position of Jethro and his advice to Moses, too. There is the complete filling out of the position of Moses that he is not alone in the thing; he has his wife now and his children too. All that enters, I think, into the Lord's supper.
Ques. Would you say, in the Song of Songs, that what is in mind earlier is what the bridegroom says to the bride, "The voice of the turtle is heard in our land ...", @Song of Songs 2:12 but at the end of the book, she moves leaning on her beloved? Is that the heavenly side?
J.T. Yes, quite so. The main thought, I think, is the Lord. After the emblems are all finished with, restfulness before the Lord would lead to reciprocation of affection between Him and ourselves in the light in which we are now speaking of ourselves, namely, as of the assembly. There are many hymns that speak of the saints in that light that do not make room for the relation between Christ and the assembly, but, if we are able to speak to the Lord on these lines, I believe there will be great enrichment and confirmation too as to the assembly's place, filling out the position, because the assembly is always the fulness of Christ.
Ques. Is it illustrated in Hosea where we get two sections placed together; the end of one is, "Thou shalt call me, My husband" @Hosea 2:16, and the
{95}
next section is, "Thou art my people; and they shall say, My God" @Hosea 2:23. Is that in keeping with the same position?
J.T. I think it is.
A.B. In connection with being to Another, it is in view that we should bring forth fruit to God.
J.T. That fits nicely, "To be to another, who has been raised up from among the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God", @Romans 7:4 and then it goes on to say, "That we should serve in newness of spirit"; @Romans 7:6 it seems the two thoughts are put together there in Romans.
H.L. Will you say a word as to the way in which the Lord calls attention to Himself in Luke, "It is *I* myself"?
J.T. He is there in assembly and is to be distinguished from the Spirit. It is the Lord we are dealing with and He is to be spoken to, as amongst us in an objective way.
-.H. Does this passage in Luke suggest that the Lord is able to overcome defective conditions in ourselves?
J.T. Yes, the facts show He is not going past these conditions; He will not proceed merely on abstract lines to reach the end He desires; He must take account of the actual concrete conditions in the company. Otherwise we should be just going on objectively without regard to the actual state of the brethren.
P.S. Would you say a word as to the introduction of the principle of resurrection as set out in the bones; how it would help us in the matter?
J.T. You mean the Lord says, "Handle me and see, for a spirit has not flesh and bones as ye see me having". "Flesh and bones" does involve resurrection; that raises the whole point as to the fact that not a bone of the passover lamb was to be broken,
{96}
and immediately you have, in that connection, Joseph's bones. The Lord here alludes to a raised state, for it is not "flesh and blood", but "flesh and bones"; bones carry forward more the identity of the person, the whole idea.
{97}
ELEVATION IN THE WILDERNESS
@Exodus 19:1 - 3,17; @Exodus 24:9 - 18
J.T. We have the idea of elevation stressed as in the wilderness in these scriptures, and also of course in the land; particularly we see it in the gospel of Matthew. David makes much of the idea of mountains -- elevation, and, in a general way, before we look into the verses read, it may be helpful to call attention to Moses¬ remarks as to the mountains in the blessing of Joseph in @Deuteronomy 33:15, "By the best things of the ancient mountains, and by the precious things of the everlasting hills". He introduces that thought in the blessing of Joseph, and we read also, in the blessing of Zebulun and Issachar, how people were invited to the mountain. The thought of the mountain no doubt alludes to Genesis where, for our present purpose, chapter 22 should be noted, that is, where Isaac was to be offered up; it is called the mount of Jehovah there and provision should be made there. In Exodus the matter is made very specific in the appearance of Jehovah to Moses at the bush at Horeb, and the word was that Israel was to serve Jehovah upon this mountain, namely Horeb, where God had appeared to Moses, as it is said, at the thorn-bush. So that the matter is set in that relation in Genesis, and it gives character to the service of God as inaugurated there. Chapter 19 brings in the thought strikingly and shows how God, in the Mediator, would stress the thought. Israel encamped, we are told, in the wilderness of Sinai, and then, "Israel encamped there before the mountain. And Moses went up to God, and Jehovah called to him out of the mountain", and, that point being established, the Mediator has a peculiar place in this respect, as in others. It says, "And Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet with God; and
{98}
they stood at the foot of the mountain", and then we are told, "Jehovah came down on mount Sinai, on the top of the mountain". @Exodus 19:20. So the Mediator's place is made clear in this respect and the people are brought to the mountain, brought to meet God, but at the foot of the mount; that is our place there; then there is the idea of ascension for the people, not only for the Mediator, but for the people. Between chapters 19 and 24 we have four chapters which are really on another matter, namely, how Israel was to be in the land, the question of the terms on which they were to be in the land, and then the Spirit of God brings us back again to the idea of the wilderness and the mountain in chapter 24 in order to bring out that God's thought for the people, too, was elevated, so that what is set out in the Mediator is then opened up to us. That is what I was thinking of, having in mind that the assembly service is in view in this book; it is a question of the service of God; that is what is connected with the mountain in chapter 3. It is just to bring before us this great principle of assembly service, even in the wilderness, that is, this elevation that is opened up to us.
H.H. You mean it is not all on a level plane, but the mountains indicate something on a higher level?
J.T. That is it, but then, in the land the same thing is true; in the eternal state of things there are higher levels too: there are the everlasting hills, as well as the ancient mountains. The Lord, we are told, went beyond all the heavens; Paul went to the third heaven; there are lower levels here, but yet elevated. All this is to instruct our minds, to form us.
E.G. Does it show that christians are a heavenly people and are to inhabit heaven, not the earth?
J.T. That is what is in mind, that God has for His people elevation and very extended too, in variety. We begin on a low level: Romans, I think,
{99}
is the level on which moral questions are all settled, so that Moses brings them out to meet God and they stood at the foot of the mount. I have to begin there, I think.
Ques. Does Abraham set out the idea in the chapter you quoted, @Genesis 22, where he introduced the thought of worship at the beginning, "I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you"? @Genesis 22:5.
J.T. Very good. That was a proper thing there. It shows how the minds of the saints were being instructed and stored with right thoughts from the outset, so that, referring back to the ancient mountains, it must be that blessing is attached to them. Noah would have come into the course of instruction, for in truth it is that; it is building up in one saint and another, so that all the instruction comes to us, the assembly having the first place with God, and it is now for us to make use of it and get it rightly in our minds.
Rem. So, in that way, there is a proper sphere for the service of God, and the service of the Mediator would introduce us into that sphere that we might be in it according to God.
J.T. Yes, I think we see the idea in Moses in Exodus, typical of Christ. The movements of Christ as seen in the New Testament are for us, including "all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us" @Acts 1:21; in all that time there were elevations too, the Lord going up, and, as He ascended finally, attention is called to the manner of it, "They beholding him" @Acts 1:9, as if that were part of the instruction, and that He would come back, the descent would be in keeping with that. In the interval we have all the instruction to carry out.
F.I. Have you in mind that, as we take account of the Lord as Mediator in the wilderness setting in
{100}
His place of elevation, we should be brought to such a position?
J.T. That is the service of Christ for us, I think. He leads in every respect and particularly in this thought of going up, ascending and descending. When on earth He spoke to Nathanael about the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man, that would be something to be seen; He was an Object here below, but then there was His own ascent, "they beholding him". @Acts 1:9.
Ques. Do you think the teaching of the kingdom, closing with chapter 18, would bring about a state in the saints to be able to sit down composedly at the foot of the mountain?
J.T. That seems to be the thought. It brings in another thing, namely Jethro, a very important man as a type here. It is not in mind now in the subject, but it is a very interesting matter that that chapter comes in between chapter 17, that treats of the Spirit at Rephidim, and the matter of ascension; we have ascension there as a matter of fact.
H.H. I notice you refer to @Deuteronomy 33. It says, "The best things of the ancient mountains" @Deuteronomy 33:15, and a note says, instead of 'things' the word 'head' may be used; and then it says, "The precious things of the everlasting hills". I suppose that would encourage us to have mountains in our thoughts and movements.
J.T. It seems so -- the ancient mountains and the everlasting hills. I suppose we have to come to the New. Testament for everlasting hills; the ancient mountains would bring in the old things: there are the new things and there are the old things, and no doubt Ararat and the mountain of Jehovah in @Genesis 22 would help on that line.
P.L. Would the ancient mountains cover more the covenant position and the everlasting hills allude
{101}
to the elevation peculiar to christianity in the assembly?
J.T. I think so, especially as attention is called to the Lord as He went up, they beholding Him, and then it is said He "shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven", @Acts 1:11 the manner of His going in.
Ques. Does that abstraction from the activities of men involve expectancy in relation to the mountain? If He were coming again, for instance, they would be expectant, with their eyes heavenward.
J.T. Quite so, in their hearts anyway. The two say, "Why stand ye gazing up into heaven?" @Acts 1:11, for He had gone out of their view. They seemed to go back into Jerusalem with the thought of elevation; they went to the upper room, that is, instead of being occupied with their literal position; the point is they are to go and carry on with that great thought in their minds; it is the principle of withdrawal from this world, getting away from it.
Ques. Do you connect that with the wilderness position?
J.T. I think that is what is seen here, for the four chapters I have alluded to really teach how Israel is to be in the land and how the worship is to be carried on there; they build an altar there, so that they pass over time; we have time in our minds, but God is saying, I have not finished with the wilderness yet. It is not that it is simply accidental; we have not come into it accidentally or perforce because we have to go somewhere, but God would say, I have more in My mind about that. So He gives instructions in chapters 21 to 23, and He comes back to this matter, namely that of Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu and seventy of the elders. Now the next thing is, what will the Mediator do in the light of this? There is instruction in all this. That is chapter 24
{102}
P.H. Do I understand you to mean that the people encamped before the mountain is to bring this great matter of elevation primarily before us? Are we to see it primarily in Christ?
J.T. I think that is the thought. "In the third month after the departure of the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai: they departed from Rephidim" -- that is alluding to the Spirit, as I understand it, the great battle in regard of the Spirit, meaning our state of soul, that we have had to do with death. @Romans 7 is passed, we have left that position, and they "came into the wilderness of Sinai, and encamped in the wilderness", and then it says, "Israel encamped there before the mountain". Now they are in a position suitable to the present purpose of God, and hence we have Moses going up to God. The Mediator has liberty to do that, I suppose alluding to Christ personally. He has always liberty to do that, and then Jehovah called to him *out of the mountain*, and so forth. I think the idea is that the people are where God would have them, and, in truth, as we learn the flesh, as in chapter 17 at the battle of Rephidim, and arrive at the thought of the Spirit, we are where God would have us; now He can do something with us. They accepted the wilderness and they pitched before the mountain, they encamped; an encampment is an educational position for a period of time. So now they are ready for resources, the thought is carried down from @Genesis 22 that the mountain is a place of provision, and they are ready for that. Now the principle is Moses going up.
H.H. Do you think that Hebrews would allow for these thoughts of elevation? The position is a wilderness one, yet opportunities are provided for the saints, as it were, to take on a higher level, as, for instance, it says in Hebrews, "Ye have come to mount Zion". @Hebrews 12:22.
{103}
There you have a mountain, and there is the consciousness of the high priest having gone in, appearing before the face of God for us.
J.T. That is, I think, in keeping with what we are saying; the scriptures, as we have remarked, are full of it, and the thought is instruction in chapter 24. Jehovah says to Moses, "Come up to me into the mountain, and be there", as much as to say, You are needed up here; this is the place now to carry on from, "and I will give thee the tables of stone", that is, divine principles, applied to ourselves, "and the law, and the commandment that I have written, for their instruction". That instruction is to be from heaven; Moses, the Mediator, is to be there, and the instruction is to be given from there, so that the whole of Scripture, I believe, is instructive. The ends of the ages have come upon us, and it is for us to gather up all these things, and, as we gather them up, we are material for the assembly, we are usable, we are intelligent material; He can take us on and use us; we are available to Him, not simply as members of a congregation, but we are alive in intelligence, being instructed, as it says, "The wise shall understand" @Daniel 12:10; we understand, and are ready now for the Lord, whatever He has in mind.
Rem. I was thinking of that in relation to expectancy. If we are brought to the foot of the mountain it is with expectant hearts with regard to what God may have to say to us.
J.T. Well, you feel there is something above you. "Be there", Jehovah says, and it is a question of instruction.
P.H. Moses is called up into the mountain to be there when he and the others are in a much more elevated position than the one which is first suggested in chapter 19. They have already gone up. What is there in that for us?
{104}
J.T. I suppose the allusion would be to the progress of the teaching of the apostles. The twelve do not give us much on that line; their names are in the foundations, but Paul gives us elevation. I suppose now they are on a higher level than in Romans; in Romans you are at the foot of the mountain, "Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? ... He that hath clean hands" @Psalm 24:3,4, those that are morally right. We must have clean hands or we cannot go up. Now it is assumed they can go up; Moses takes the people in hand to make them ready for that; God does not tell them what to do. From verse 3 to the end of verse 8 it is the action of the Mediator, so it says, "Moses came and told the people all the words of Jehovah, and all the judgements; and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words that Jehovah has said will we do! And Moses wrote all the words of Jehovah, and rose up early in the morning, and built an altar under the mountain, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel. And he sent the youths of the children of Israel, and they offered up burnt-offerings, and sacrificed sacrifices of peace-offering of bullocks to Jehovah" @Exodus 24:3 - 5, and then we have the blood sprinkled on the book and on the people, and then they went up; that is, the moral element is settled. It is Christ taking the thing in hand in relation to what is due to God, and also to fit us for this elevation. It is progress really in the teaching that is in mind, and how we need that!
Ques. "I have borne you on eagles¬ wings and brought you to myself" @Exodus 19:4; is that before us, and is moral work going on then to fit us for that condition?
J.T. God has brought us to Himself. That would be in a moral sense, of course; that is Romans really, not on the mountain yet. Elevation follows that; He is speaking from the mountain, but He
{105}
does not say He has brought them up there; it is the moral thought, but elevation is more personal, that you are worthy of going up there.
Ques. Do you connect the first ascent of the seventy with the ministry of the twelve and the ascent of Moses and Joshua with Paul's ministry bringing out what is more distinctive; and then, over and above that, Moses¬ position, typical of Christ as above all heavens?
J.T. That is good. I do not think Romans implies anything beyond that we are brought to God; @Exodus 19 does not take us beyond that; they are brought to God, and not only so by Himself, but it is the work of the Mediator. I think we ought to notice that God does not refer to the Mediator in saying, 'I have brought you to Myself'; it is His own action, but now the Mediator comes in, that is what Christ is to us. And He leads the people out of the camp; the camp is right; they took up that position themselves; applying it to assembly service it would mean we come together and break bread; that is our matter, it is a public matter, it is a camp really: we are pitching, but that is not the end, that is only the beginning, and the Mediator comes in there and He brings them out of that position to meet God. It is not simply that God brings us to Himself in the gospel, but the action of the Mediator in beginning all the great service that is in mind, knowing, as He does, what is in the mind of God; so that He brings out of that position, the camp, which in itself was right, to God -- not *up* yet, but to God; He is in it now. It is one thing for God to bring me to Himself in the gospel, but it is another thing for Christ to bring me with others to a certain position to meet with God.
Rem. In chapter 19 there seems to be an expressed desire on the part of Jehovah to meet with
{106}
the people, that they "may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee also for ever". @Exodus 19:9
J.T. I think these chapters are intended to show how we come to value Christ and how He must have His place. Of course hierarchical christianity is left out; it is a question of Christ, first as Mediator and then as Priest. He is acting as Himself here, the Mediator; He knows God and He wants us to meet God, but to meet Him at the foot of the mountain; it is a level place so far. And then God opens up, in chapters 21 - 23, what His thoughts are in view of the future. You are in the wilderness actually and He returns to this position in chapter 24.
A.J.G. Then are these chapters, 20 - 23, to enable us to move up, according to chapter 24, with greater dignity, as heavenly minded?
J.T. I think, having this great prospect before us, what is in these four chapters includes Christ as the Lover of God, the Lover of the assembly, and all that. Great things are opened up to us in these four chapters, and then God comes back to the wilderness again, in chapter 24, as if we are more ready for going up. If I understand my heavenly prospect, that I am going up in truth, why not come into it now in a provisional way?
Ques. Is that why the nobles are mentioned?
J.T. Exactly; there is the anticipation of what we are to be in the land.
P.H. "Moses came and told the people all the words of Jehovah, and all the judgments". @Exodus 24:3. Does that expression, "all the judgments" cover these four chapters you have spoken of? I notice in the beginning of the chapter it says, "These are the judgments which thou shalt set before them" @Exodus 21:1.
J.T. Yes. Now before those four chapters Moses had gone up, but then the people are to go up, and Moses would say, What about this? God wants you
{107}
to go up, but what about those words? I think it is typical. Of course it may be used as contrast in the teaching of christianity rightly, but we may use it typically, that these three chapters enrich us, they give us to see what we are to be in prospect, but it is in the wilderness at the foot of the mountain, and God would say, You are capable of more, and I want you to get it. The wilderness is a provisional thing, as I understand it, so that, when you come to chapter 24, you are still in the wilderness and take on this thought of elevation. Down to the end of verse 11 the actual mountain or place of our ascent is not mentioned; it is mentioned in regard to the building of the pillars, but as a place it is not mentioned, it is a provisional thought; but after verse 11 you will find the word is mentioned very frequently, that Moses is going there, and he is to be there, that Christ is there in the interim.
Ques. So that His being there fixedly would not refer so much to the glory of His Person but to the glory of His mediatorship?
J.T. Yes.
E.G. In chapters 20 - 23 if we are really to be here active in the service of God, it means we have to understand our heavenly position. Take a man like J.N.D., how his hymns speak of the future and going to be with Christ in the heavenly position!
J.T. And in truth I believe, through the goodness of God, in this revival in which we now have part, the first great thing was to open up the heavenly and eternal side -- all things made clear -- and then our part. Ephesians is said to have been the best read part of scripture in those times; the saints were taking it into their minds in prospect, not so much entering into it. Now I think the Lord has brought us round to taking up things in practice and taking up the concrete thought of them, and included in all this is the service of God. It is a
{108}
provisional matter, but all these wonderful thoughts are to add richness to us in the thoughts we are taking up now in our present weakness and small conditions. What would you say?
Rem. That is interesting. I was going to enquire as to what you have already pointed out, when it speaks of the seventy going up, that it is confined to the thought of going up, no place being mentioned; it is more than positional.
J.T. It is the state of our souls.
Rem. But with Christ it is position.
J.T. After verse 12 it is the fixed position of the Mediator, so it says, "Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and ascended the mountain. And Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights". That is the provisional period.
Ques. So do I gather that the book of Exodus has the wilderness position in mind, but with the heavenly thought in the minds of the saints?
J.T. That is the thought as I see it; what do you say?
P.L. Well, we "have come to mount Zion" @Hebrews 12:22; of course that is a more extended thought, but is the thought of elevation there laying hold of the Hebrews?
J.T. That is right; the whole range of things, seven or eight things. We have come to mount Zion; it is just in keeping with all this as enriching our souls. We come to mount Zion "and to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem; and to myriads of angels, the universal gathering; and to the assembly of the firstborn who are registered in heaven" @Hebrews 12:22,23 -- another great thought, registered in heaven; that is the elevation; and then other things on a lower level, but you get all those great things first. "And to God, judge of all; and to the spirits of just men made perfect; and to Jesus, mediator of a new covenant; and to the blood of sprinkling, speaking better than Abel". @Hebrews 12:23,24.
{109}
Now you will observe we come back again, we go up and come down again, and that is what we get in Exodus.
Rem. But as coming down you bring that light in your soul.
J.T. Yes, you are an Ephesian coming back to Romans and Corinthians.
Rem. So these things would support the saints as in the acceptance of reproach here as in the next chapter.
J.T. Quite so, you see how great you are.
E.G. Is "To God the judge of all" @Hebrews 12:23 the highest thought?
J.T. Not exactly, because it is a relative thought; you need it in view of what you are coming back to.
E.G. Is it a central thought?
J.T. Yes, it is a great central thought, and it is needed. Look at the condition of the nations now; we have to carry on provisionally in the midst of all these things; how great a thing it is to have the light of God in our souls!
A.J.G. It is like Daniel whose name means, God is judge, as though that was his support in the circumstances in which he was.
J.T. Quite so, and no one brings that side out more than he does. The position of the nations is a constant menace to the saints; well, God is above that. "The spirits of just men made perfect" @Hebrews 12:23 -- well, God will come amongst the brethren who are just; that is what we come down to, what we get in our meetings. And then first, "To Jesus, mediator of a new covenant" @Hebrews 12:24; we come back here to how we are to be at liberty in the meetings. This lifts us up and then lets us down, as the sheet was taken up and let down, and goes up finally.
Ques. Would you say a word as to how this would affect us at the Supper, the thought of moral elevation in the service of God? We have been
{110}
perhaps a good deal occupied with the position of matters, but would this chapter 24 help us to take on the thought of assembly service properly?
J.T. You see how you come back to "Jesus the mediator" and then to "the blood of sprinkling, speaking better than Abel". @Hebrews 12:24. You say, I know my place is in heaven, but I have had to do with things here through the week. But the idea is now we will begin over again at the foot of the mountain.
Ques. Would not Moses saying, "Behold the blood of the covenant" be something like the touch of the Lord on our spirits?
J.T. Quite so.
P.L. The tribes of Jah go up, and then you come back again, for there are set thrones for judgment, "God the judge of all" @Hebrews 12:23, then you "pray for the peace of Jerusalem" @Psalm 122:6, and "for my brethren and companions¬ sakes I will now say, Peace be within thee". @Psalm 122:8. Is that the practical situation among the brethren?
J.T. Quite so. You can see that in the Songs of Degrees from which you quote, the same thing is there. You begin at the low level, "Woe is me, that I sojourn in Meshech" @Psalm 120:5, but, "I lift up mine eyes unto the mountains". @Psalm 121:1. He has light in his soul, he knows about Zion and he is going there. What a blessed thing it is to go through all the experiences with the Mediator, He is with us all the time, but He goes higher. Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu and seventy of the elders of Israel go up; He goes higher, but still He is with us.
Ques. Does verse 11 show we are filling out the position for the service of God?
J.T. Quite so. "Upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand; also they saw God, and did eat and drink". They are fit for the place -- nobles. The higher we go, the greater we are; we are not strangers there.
{111}
Ques. The last word the people say to God before they go up is 'obedient'; is that an important moral thought in going up?
J.T. Very nice. Such a people can go up. God knew that; He knows what we are equal to and calls us up, so that the epistle to the Hebrews gives boldness of access.
Ques. You have mentioned elsewhere, in regard to @John 13, the need for a touch from the Lord, whatever we may do by way of self-judgment and so on; it is imperative that the Lord must touch us and help if the service of God is to take place. Do you think in chapter 24 we get prefigured some service of Christ in relation to the cup in the Supper?
J.T. I think so. The part Moses has corresponds with what is experienced. We come together to do a certain thing, but then He joins us, and we look for that. There is always freshness; we go through the whole thing again, and I think the constant action of Moses is to bring that before us.
Rem. I was thinking of its coming directly before they go up; the attempt to rise without that touch is to attempt something we cannot manage.
J.T. Well, I think it is very beautiful to see how, in the New Testament, the Lord helps people, His constant activity on our behalf. He compels them to go into the boat; they are without Him. In Mark He made as if He would go further, as if to say, 'You are not going on too well'; but in Matthew He walks on the water and He says, "It is I". Peter says, "If it be thou, bid me come unto thee" @Matthew 14:27,28; that is a better state of things. John says they were in trying circumstances, and he tells us how much they had rowed; they were making headway. The Lord joins them and they were at the end immediately, showing there is more power there in John; and I think the Lord comes in in that way, and, according
{112}
to the state of the meeting, you get ends or you do not get them: sometimes we do not get anything.
P.L. Is that in a suitable Mark setting of levites where the care of the churches is to be carried and we see what the Lord feels about the situation? Is it a word to levites in that way?
J.T. I think it is, and even Luke helps us -- the Lord stood in their midst. It does not say He comes; that thought was not in His mind, He just stood there, but in John He *came* and stood. I think Mark would say, Well, first of all you have a good deal of light and privilege but the state is not right, and you may not get the Lord; He may go further, you may miss Him.
Ques. Does He not delay coming in Mark? In the evening He saw them, but He awaits the fourth watch (@Mark 6:48).
J.T. Quite so, He gives them full opportunity to go further.
P.L. Space for repentance.
P.H. What is involved in the thought of nobles in this chapter?
J.T. I think how you are up there; you are equal to the place up there; Hebrews would make us that, I think. Hebrews would make us bold.
Ques. Would it be reached practically under David in the princely offerings of those who offered? This is the light of that in our souls.
J.T. Quite so. You have more than the Mediator, you have the sweet psalmist of Israel there, the inaugurator of the service of God.
Ques. I was wondering whether the transparent sapphire would indicate the scope of what is before us. We are brought to God; with the Mediator all things would be clear. Would it involve the understanding of the glory of God in all His ways?
J.T. Quite so, 'Heavenly light makes all things bright' (`12:3).
{113}
P.H. Say a little more, please, about what was under His feet.
J.T. Well, I suppose it is the ground we are on as elevated. Moses and Aaron and the others went up; it does not say they went up to a place, it is just the idea of going up, "and they saw the God of Israel; and there was under his feet as it were work of transparent sapphire". It is a created sphere; it is not light unapproachable, it is what God comes into on our account, transparent sapphire, and as it were the form, or body, of heaven for clearness. It would seem as if everything is clear; there is nothing mystical; it is the ground on which God is with us, and, in a way, the ground we may take with Him. What He stood on is like the terms on which He is with us, but it is a created sphere; we will never get into the uncreated sphere, we are creatures always. The Mediator goes higher; He goes beyond the heavens.
Ques. Does it fit in with @2 Corinthians 3?
J.T. Well, going up is more than the covenant; when we come to verses 9, 10 and 11, we have ascent, which is a thought beyond that.
Rem. I was thinking of the transforming.
J.T. There is no transforming here; it is a work under the feet of God, it is the ground on which God is, I think, that is in mind, and we are brought up to it, not that it is said they stood on that. It is the ground on which God is but it is on created ground; we cannot know Him otherwise.
A.J.G. You mean it suggests the economy into which He has come so that we might be brought to know Him.
J.T. It is what is intelligible to us; it is God coming into our condition.
Ques. Do you think that Paul's doxology in @Romans 11 shows him to be on this ground with God?
{114}
J.T. I think that is good, Romans helps in this in many ways. You get it in the very first chapter, "The Creator, who is blessed for ever". @Romans 1:25.
Ques. Do you think the sense these would have of what God was, the ground He was on, would enter into the response He looked for: "Let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them"? @Exodus 25:8. Would it give a peculiar sense of the grace that desired to be with them in wilderness circumstances? Do you think that would add lustre to the contributions?
J.T. I think so. The house of God in its provisional setting now is composed of a heavenly people. You do not get the house of God in Romans or in Corinthians, properly; it belongs to Ephesians; it is a heavenly people down here. How could I provide conditions for God, having seen Him up there, save as I have been up there?
Rem. So that the contributions that went to make the sanctuary were really heavenly.
J.T. They must be. If we are to make God a dwelling place, we must see His circumstances up there. God says, as it were, I am content to be without the pavement; that is, He is sacrificing to be with us. The tabernacle was a figurative representation of things above in heaven, but the flooring is that God says, 'I have travelled with you all these years in a tent and a tabernacle'.
P.L. Does John's allusion to the Lord tabernacling amongst us show that grace has dispensed with the pavement?
J.T. I think so.
E.G. It is an extraordinary thing that Nadab and Abihu sank as low as they did according to @Leviticus 10.
J.T. Yes, "Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen". @Revelation 2:5. Their guilt was all the greater because they had been up so high.
{115}
P.H. You referred earlier to the fact that it is a matter of mind. Do we carry these two positions on together, being up there in @Exodus 24, and preparation for the position down here where God would graciously be with us? Does one prepare for the other?
J.T. Certainly, one should never give up his heavenly calling. Carry it in your heart when you are doing your business, or teaching in a school, or whatever it may be; the occupation tends to bring us down and the idea is to begin over again. It is a very, very blessed thought.
P.L. 'Fresh from God's exhaustless tides'. (`76:2).
Ques. Would the epistle to the Philippians show us how christians live in the heavenly circumstances? Paul speaks of minding heavenly things and then being content in whatever circumstances he is.
J.T. I think so. Philippians is the heavenly man here; Ephesians is the heavenly man up there. It is a present thing, time is left out there; He has done it: "has raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies". @Ephesians 2:6.
E.G. Did you say before that the Lord is hampered in His work in us if we do not, in some measure, apprehend Colossians and Ephesians?
J.T. Well, we are not capable of the assembly. He cannot take us on; this divine thought is to have our intelligence. Paul, in Ephesians, stresses the fact that he knew, and he says, I want you to know that I know. Then the next thing is they should know; the thing is knowable, so that the more we know spiritually, the more capable we are of joining the Lord. I believe it is important for the brethren to keep in mind that in the revival the prophetic side was opened up to us and then the heavenly side stressed, but more in an objective way. It was a question of opening the thing up for
{116}
us, but now we have other things come in. The great thought forty-five years ago was the reality of eternal life, that it is a thing to be enjoyed; and then subsequently the thought of the service of God. And then, about thirty years ago, the thought was put out that the ground of the assembly is resurrection, which is not true. Christianity is a heavenly thing, it goes up and comes down and goes up again.
H.H. Forty-five years ago the attack was on the heavenly side, was it not?
J.T. Yes, they were making everything objective, and, if you keep on the objective side only, you have nothing but theory; you want the concrete thought, and hence eternal life was to be entered into and enjoyed: Lay hold on it, as Paul says to Timothy. Israel's ground will be resurrection; christianity is on heavenly ground, the assembly is heavenly.
A.J.G. I am not sure I follow the bearing on us at the present time of what you said as to God graciously dispensing with the flooring, the pavement of sapphire, so to speak.
J.T. I think it is to bring out His love that is ready to join us down here where we are. But these references to elevation, I think, are to show us that provisionally we can go up, even in wilderness circumstances..
A.J.G. You do not surrender anything in regard to the wilderness position in going up?
J.T. No. God comes down to our side, but with a view to our going up.
H.H. Cherishing the truth of the house of God helps us to appreciate the thought of going up. Would you say it does not exactly connect itself either with Romans or Corinthians, hence the going up and the thought of the house of God are correlated?
J.T. I think so, the house is composed of what is heavenly.
{117}
Ques. Do you think if we hold the heavenly side as light only, there will be a tendency to overlook the wilderness position?
J.T. Quite so, and God is bringing them back to the wilderness.
Rem. I wondered if Hosea would bear on it. "When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt" @Hosea 11:1; but you also get the alluring her and speaking to her heart, as though she would arrive at that thought through that process; -- bringing her back to that. And really every Lord's day is the same thing with us, you come to the idea no longer Baali but husband; you come into a closer relationship.
E.G. Is that why we come to the Supper again?
J.T. I think so, and it is worth while, for it is a fresh view of Christ every week.
{118}
ATTRACTIVENESS OF THE HOUSE OF GOD
@John 8: 34 - 36; @Luke 15:24,25; @1 Peter 2:4,5; @Ephesians 2:19 - 22
J.T. It is in mind particularly that we might see the house of God in its attractiveness especially for the young, as affording spiritual enjoyment. To some of them our meetings are dull, and it is needful to keep in mind the features of the house that afford enjoyment, enjoyment that lies in affection rather than in understanding; hence the thought of the house of God must be made concrete. The first scripture has in mind the liberty that is opened up to young believers; the concrete side of the house is in mind rather than the abstract, but the Son abides in it, so that it affords permanence in the way of liberty. Then in Luke it is dependent on the gospel and presented in a peculiarly attractive way as having in it music and dancing, holiness entering into it from the outset, so that, as young ones begin to taste the joys of the house of God, they also begin to realise the need of holiness, that indeed they are possessed of it as having the Holy Spirit themselves. But it is presented in a public way in @Luke 15, for the elder brother would discern the merriment going on inside, although he had no taste for it. And then in Peter the holiness is more concrete, it says we ourselves are the living stones as coming to Christ as the living stone, and "built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God", so that the element of sacrifice enters into the service of God. And then finally, that we are at home there, "no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints", not only in the house, but of God's household, the foundation and the ornamentation of it in Christ being the corner-stone; it is ultimately a
{119}
habitation of God by the Spirit. In @Luke 14 the house is linked up with the gospel, "That my house may be filled". @Luke 14:23. That is also an abstract view, only the light and the attraction lie in the fact that the house is mentioned, "my house"; those who enter are seen as particularly suited to it, the point is it is the mind of God for them.
Ques. Will you say a little more of what you have in mind when you speak of the enjoyment being more in the affection than the intelligence?
J.T. Well, music and dancing of course do not require the intelligent side so much; enjoyment is through intercourse with persons from the standpoint of affection. When we come to Peter, we have the idea of life and priesthood; priesthood requires intelligence, but the mere thought of the elements of music and dancing does not stress the idea of intelligence.
M.W.B. Why did you turn to the scripture about liberty first? Is it because we must be set free from what would hinder us?
J.T. I thought that was the first thing to have before us, that the Lord works it out from persons who are serving sin, and young believers are not strangers to that -- alas, none of us is a stranger to that -- but the Lord does not stress the sin side, but that the servant of sin does not abide in the house for ever; being a bondman he has no fixedness there, he may be ejected at any time.
Ques. "Make you free" -- is that deliverance?
J.T. Yes, I think it is. Of course the Lord spoke about them sinning, "Every one that practises sin is the bondman of sin. Now the bondman abides not in the house for ever: the son abides for ever. If therefore the Son shall set you free, ye shall be really free". It links on with the gospel, but from the standpoint of the profession, I think; that is, those who were already in the profession of christianity,
{120}
or in the profession of judaism as it was then; not the gross gentile thing in the world, but whatever was and whatever is now profession.
Ques. Is that why the Son sets free?
J.T. Yes, it is over against the legal profession, not simply that it is legal service, but it is sinful service in that system, and those who are serving thus are bondmen as he says, and they have no title to permanency. The bondman in the type acquires permanency by dying, so to speak, he had his ear bored by the judges, but those who are around us in the profession externally would appear to be serving sin.
Ques. "Cast out the bondwoman and her son" @Genesis 21:10 -- would that come in?
J.T. Well, the point is that the servant of sin is himself a bondman, and for that reason he can be ejected, he is not to continue, but it is a very solemn thing that it is a bondman of *sin;* it makes it a very serious matter for all who are serving in a lawless way, for "sin is lawlessness" @1 John 3:4; even if it be religious lawlessness, it is sin.
M.W.B. Would it answer to what we have in @Romans 6:22, "Having got your freedom from sin, and having become bondmen to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness"? The bondman idea is implied there; the "fruit unto holiness" involving your second idea.
J.T. I think that is good, involving the house, as in Peter, and holiness.
M.W.B. This is a liberty implying almost sonship, is it not? That is what is in mind, I think; not that we are said to be sons in John, but the point is that the son is over against the bondman as it works out practically now.
J.T. I think it is those who are serving in a religious lawless way, and they have no title to stay in the house, but the son remains in it.
{121}
J.J. In the end of @Matthew 11, do we get an example of the Son setting persons free in the company of the Son? He had just been reprimanding various cities; then He says to some, "Come unto me ... and I will give you rest". @Matthew 11:28 Is that the idea?
J.T. Well, He had addressed His Father, "I thank thee, O Father", @Matthew 11:25 so that sonship is asserted there, and He spoke to His Father about hiding from certain ones and revealing to others, so that it certainly corresponds, I think. The Lord goes on to show that He is a centre of attraction, "... all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest". @Matthew 11:28. Then He proceeds, in chapter 12, to go through the cornfields; that is really what is in mind in setting them free. And then His disciples pluck the corn and eat it, meaning He had given them liberty on the sabbath; He was setting them free.
Ques. Is the *Son* setting us free an advance on the *truth* setting us free?
J.T. Clearly. The truth acts on your conscience and you begin to judge things. "Ye shall know the truth", the Lord says -- a very important side to the matter -- "and the truth shall set you free". But it is the business of those who know it to make it known as much as possible, and, as it is made known, people liberate themselves by the truth itself; it is the action of the truth. The next statement is as to sonship in Christ, which is more an appeal to the heart, I think -- a very attractive thought.
Ques. When John writes his second letter, to the elect lady, he speaks of the truth first and then he refers to the Lord as the Son of the Father. I wondered whether that would combine the two ideas; it is an expression you do not get anywhere else, "the Son of the Father, in truth and love". @2 Peter 2:15. I thought perhaps the lady had been set free by the truth and now by the Son. Would you say that?
{122}
J.T. Well, that is good. The truth has a wide circulation now in religious circles, and it is a great matter to keep that before us in our prayers, for the truth has power in itself. That is really a good reason why it should get as wide a circulation as possible; it has power in itself. But then, it deals with the conscience and with the intelligence; then there is the heart, the Person of Christ is for the heart, and it is the Son who gives liberty. The truth sets us free too, so that there is a double service contemplated, what the truth effects and what the Son effects. I think the truth may have a circulation as wide as the profession, but sonship must be known where the Lord's rights are owned. "Whose house are we" @Hebrews 3:6 must involve continuance in the truth. It is there, I think, the sonship of Christ is apprehended.
Ques. Is it brought out in the man in @John 9 where he seems to get free by the truth, and then gets an impression of the Son, at the end of the chapter?
J.T. Exactly. The latter is in view of chapter 10, as has often been remarked, which implies the house, because it is the collective side; not that the house is mentioned, but it is one flock and one Shepherd, analogous to the service of Christ in the house. The truth may go very far afield; it has authority in itself.
H.H. In the beginning of the Acts, we have the house in a very distinctive way. When the Spirit came things were located in a very definite way, but it is not quite the same now.
J.T. The house was there evidently in the saints and truth too, for Peter begins with his *words*, "Hearken to my words", @Acts 2:and then, at the end of the chapter we have the apostles¬ doctrine.
H.H. I think what you say helps considerably; it was in the saints. We are apt to look for something in the way of a building, so that that would test us
{123}
at the present time as to how far we have really got things.
J.T. I think so, especially as to whether sonship is known, Christ apprehended as Son in all the attractiveness of it, which young saints need to get hold of. Now in @Acts 2, first we have the teaching and fellowship of the apostles -- the converts persevered in that, and in the breaking of bread and prayers -- and then it goes on to tell us that "all that believed were together, and had all things common, and sold their possessions and substance, and distributed them to all, according as anyone might have need. And every day, being constantly in the temple with one accord, and breaking bread in the house, they received their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, praising God, and having favour with all the people". @Acts 2:44 - 46. It seems to me that is the thought; the merriment is there; it was a very happy state of things in which anyone in whom God was working would gladly join. Then it says, "The Lord added" to that; but it awaited the truth of sonship, I believe, to complete the thought of the house, the Lord being apprehended in that beautiful relationship with God -- indeed ourselves in it, too.
P.H. Do you link this up at all with the thought of Solomon, as building the house, and the words which he uses, his prayer and his words at the dedication of the house, Solomon being suggestive supremely of sonship? I am thinking of the scripture in 2 Chronicles where the house is built, the work was finished which Solomon made for the house of Jehovah, and where he says that he had built an house of habitation for God, a settled place for Him to abide in for ever. Then it says the king turned his face and blessed the whole congregation of Israel. I wondered whether you would think that Solomon as the son making a house for Jehovah to dwell in
{124}
and suggesting the thought of blessing in connection with it would fit in with your suggestion as to John.
J.T. Very fully. And in Kings we have even more attractiveness in the description of the house: the folding doors could be thrown open, so that, according to conditions, the divine Presence is happily entered into. Besides that, there are side chambers in the house, places of intimacy, and the whole position in the dedication of the house involves the feast of tabernacles, that is a feast involving holy nearness among the brethren, dwelling in booths. Not that Solomon carried it to the full length, because Nehemiah and Ezra went further than he did; they had a better time really in the remnant period than Solomon had, in that sense; they had the actual booths, so it is said of Nehemiah's feast of tabernacles that "since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so". @Nehemiah 8:17. A comforting thought for us now, for I believe it involves sonship and our relations with one another in that way as brethren, so that, instead of being at a distance from one another we enjoy nearness, and the Lord as seen in @John 8 is attractive. He sets free; He is in the house for ever in that state of things. Solomon prevailed everywhere and presided over everything that was done; so Christ is everything in the house, He is over it, He built it; here He is in it, so that He is *in* it and *over* it, and He is very active for young people. Of course, those of us who have already proved it, we know; but abstention from the meetings and lethargy in them but indicate how little this is understood. The psalms show how they went to the house of God, a joyous company; they had joy even in going. Elsewhere we see how God makes us glad in His house of prayer; even the prayer meetings are said to be happy.
Ques. Do you think in @Luke 15 the merriment reaches as high as @Ephesians 5? "Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord". @Ephesians 5:19.
{125}
J.T. I think the terms used -- "Let us ... be merry", and then, "They began to be merry" and then the music and the dancing, involve that it is heard.
Ques. Is the music and dancing the result of an appreciation of Christ?
J.T. Well, it is a figure of real merriment. The Spirit of God does not here bring in such an illustration in verses 23 and 24, though of course music and dancing was employed in the service of God at one time. We have to understand what real merriment in the house of God means now, even in the meeting for prayer. It seems as if @Luke 15, which of course is a parable right through, would come in.
Rem. I thought, as the Father is in it, it would be pretty high.
J.T. It is such as is heard outside, and ought to be attractive to anybody. Ephesians is, no doubt, on a higher level, but it is involved in it.
N.K.M. Eating seems to be connected with merriment, "Let us eat, and be merry", and that passage in @Acts 2 you quoted from says, they received their food with gladness and singleness of heart. Will you say a word about that?
J.T. Well, it is a good feature of the position. We have been speaking about @Exodus 24 lately, how the saints, as elevated, ate and drank before God: they did so as regarded as nobles, It involves enjoyment too; it is a figure, I think, of enjoyment. We were saying it is over against the idolatrous conduct in @Exodus 32 where they ate and drank and rose up to play without Moses, without the Lord Jesus in type. That is the world, of course; that is outside, and young people are attracted by that. But @Exodus 24 is the antidote, what is up there, what we are
{126}
invited to, for it was God's own thought they should go up.
Rem. If it speaks of the Father in @Luke 15 we are to understand it is the house of God that is in mind.
J.T. Well, exactly. The Father's proposal does not mention the house; it seems as if we have to look for the house, if we connect it with the doctrine in the epistles, in the prodigal himself; he is the kind of person that forms it, a thoroughly recovered person made heavenly in every way.
Ques. Would the psalmist, in @Psalm 84, be proving the blessedness of it when he says, "How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts!"? @Psalm 84:1. Then he says, "Blessed are they that dwell in thy house; they will be still praising thee". @Psalm 84:4.
J.T. I think the psalms are a fine field for any one who is at all desirous of entering into the house and enjoying it; we have such fine examples of enjoyment in it. I believe that is the great value of the psalms: they give experimental testimony to everything that they speak of, and above all things the house, even before they come to it; they were a joyous company.
Ques. Is music and dancing as much for testimony as it is for enjoyment in the house?
J.T. Apparently so. It is such a happy and glorious state of things that you hardly like to bring in direct testimony, but it is really so, because the elder brother discerned it was there; it was a testimony to him which he refused, so there is testimony in it; and in truth it ought to be seen in the saints that we are a joyous company, that we have something.
Rem. In the enjoyment of what is permanent and at liberty.
J.T. Exactly.
{127}
Ques. Is the end of @Psalm 113 an extension of what you speak of? "He maketh the barren woman to keep house, as a joyful mother of sons. Hallelujah!" @Psalm 113:9.
J.T. Very good. Some say that was one of the psalms sung at the time of the last passover; but anyhow it is the spirit of it, a joyful mother, not of children, but of *sons*.
W.H.E. Does the house of God take in our own houses in any connection, or does it refer to the saints only as convened at meetings?
J.T. Well, the way it is put in 1 Timothy makes it very wide. You have eldership and deaconship and other services, and then the apostle says, "That thou mayest know how one ought to conduct oneself in God's house", @1 Timothy 3:15 as if the thought of it extends in that way to our houses, but, properly speaking, it is the saints viewed as living stones as being built up. Hebrews says, "Whose house are we", @Hebrews 3:6 as continuing; but Peter gives us a concrete thought, I think, of what is concretely permanent, real living stones but built up a spiritual house, leading up to the thought of the service of God. The house of God is usually in the types connected with the temple itself, that is in truth where He was, that is where God dwelt; but the environment was glorious; there were the house of the forest of Lebanon, the house of Pharaoh's daughter, and the house where the throne was; they are all somewhat vague, but they are all intended to produce an impression of it as an environment full of affection, and Solomon dominating all; the son over all. It was remarked that all those were of like work with the house of God. It would reflect what is in the house of God, but I think the house of God is the temple always.
Ques. Might we have a word as to the difference between the house of God and the assembly? Timothy says the house of God is the assembly.
{128}
J.T. We are speaking of the house of God in order to stress the side of affection and enjoyment; the assembly presenting more, I think, the side of intelligence, that in which we have things carried out; so that, when the apostle approaches the thought of the assembly convened, he says, "I speak as to intelligent persons", @1 Corinthians 10:15 and he stresses throughout the idea of intelligence in @1 Corinthians 11, 12, 13 and 14, particularly chapters 11, 12 and 14. It is the same thing the passage in Timothy speaks of, "which is the assembly of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth". @1 Timothy 3:15. But the house is one thing; the house is to be apprehended, I think, as more setting out the dwelling, as indeed Ephesians stresses, a habitation of God where He dwells, and we there as no longer strangers and foreigners, but of His household, not simply in the household, but of His household, coming directly under the Lord as in the house.
Ques. Do the house and the temple coalesce? What would be the distinction?
J.T. The house is one thing; the temple is another. Everything will be intelligible;. I believe the temple will make everything intelligible. This is a great complete thought and it is growing to that; it is not that yet, it is growing to it.
J.J. Is not the passage in @Hebrews 3 very helpful? "*He* has been counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, by how much he that has built it has more honour than the house. For every house is built by some one; but he who has built all things is God". @Hebrews 3:3,4. And Moses was in the house as a ministering servant, "but Christ, as Son over his house, whose house are *we*, if indeed we hold fast the boldness and the boast of hope firm to the end". @Hebrews 3:6. I thought it was the house of God -- "he who has built all things is God".
J.T. It is the house of God right through.
{129}
M.W.B. Is what is prominent in @Luke 15 particularly affection?
J.T. That is what I thought. The figure would show that there is music and dancing; it becomes a question really of enjoyment, and you might say nothing else but enjoyment, and hence so attractive in the gospel. That is why one thought of it so that the young people might see there is something worth while, that it is not a doleful place, and that there is real enjoyment in it.
H.H. Where it says, "no longer strangers and foreigners", does that take account of the saints as being down here, that is, the saints viewed as God's dwelling place down here?
J.T. Yes, only composed of those who are said to have been raised up together.
H.H. So, as you have said, you hardly get the full thought of it in Romans or Corinthians.
J.T. That is right, you do not get the house in Romans or Corinthians.
J.R. Have you the thought of elevation in the house? I was thinking of a verse in Isaiah, "Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer", @Isaiah 56:7.
J.T. That is a very good scripture to bring in, and it fits in with Ephesians too, for the alien and the eunuch are alluded to: they will be made joyful in God's house of prayer. It is a very attractive thought, for the prayer meeting is, I believe, often looked at as a secondary matter, and anyhow not as implying any enjoyment; but God says it is more than that, it is my house of prayer and I will make you joyful in it.
P.H. Are the thoughts of joy elaborated on in @Luke 15 in connection with the best robe and the ring and the fatted calf? Are they the features known inside that cause the joy?
{130}
J.T. I think so. Good clothes do make young people feel happy; how much is made of clothes! And God does not shrink from coming down to our small thoughts in these matters, and now He is presenting clothes to us of the very best quality, including the shoes and a ring; they go a long way in making up the happiness of the place. Think of everybody being like that, for that is the idea. We are not in the house according to human etiquette and principles: nothing is more like the fly in the ointment of the apothecary than worldly thoughts brought in in that connection.
Ques. Is your thought that the Lord would have us perfectly free to enter into His joy? I was thinking of Zephaniah. "The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing". @Zephaniah 3:17. Is that the atmosphere that is entered into in the house of God?
J.T. Quite so, it is God's joy in us, I think that enters into @Luke 15; it ought to appeal to us, the lavishness expended on us, both in regard to our clothes, our shoes, and then in what is on the table to be included in our enjoyment, in the figure, culminating in, a testimony outside that anyone can hear or discern. In other words, any young person should see that we have something good, we have happy conditions, our meetings are really enjoyable, they are not doleful.
J.J. You have said elsewhere that what we receive in the way of testimony has to be consolidated in our minds and that is largely done through singing. I would like to ask you how you would explain that?
J.T. I think there is something in that. Singing is to characterise a redeemed people and it is stressed in both Colossians and Ephesians, even Corinthians speaks about it. I believe that singing in a spiritual
{131}
sense is penetrative peculiarly; music is penetrative, both as applying to God and ourselves.
J.J. Is that what you meant by being consolidated?
J.T. Well, things do become consolidated in your soul, for the singing involves real holy sentiment; the whole book of Psalms has that in mind -- holy sentiment.
A.E.L. The words that are sung would be the important thing.
J.T. Well, the music, too. Sometimes we hear, in a meeting like this, that the music is to be from the platform, but really that is a wrong principle; the music is as much a part of the service as the words. In @2 Chronicles 5 the music is the one sound that is stressed; it is part of the service. You cannot have singing without music.
M.W.B. Not to divert you, but while you are on the question of audible singing, there is a habit that is growing in some meetings of almost inaudible singing. Does that show spirituality or the lack of it?
J.T. I am sure anyone who is silent when a real spiritual song is going on is not much in the good of things; even whispering is poor.
M.W.B. I could hardly understand the feelings of the heart being full and the mouth closed or scarcely opened.
J.T. I am sure that is important, for many do not join in much. It is a spiritual matter and enters into the service of the house of God more than ordinary speaking as far as I can see, so we ought to accustom ourselves to it.
Ques. "Making melody in your heart" -- is that not before God?
J.T. "Singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord", @Ephesians 5:19. That means the singing is first, the melody goes with it. The singers went
{132}
before and the players on stringed instruments followed after; the music comes after the singing.
P.H. @Psalm 113 begins and ends with Hallelujah -- praise Jah! Would that support your thought of the great penetration that is open to the saints in the service of song? And the last five psalms, I believe, give great place to this thought of praising God, Jah.
J.T. The last book is really the culmination of the whole matter; it is full of that; and then we have not only that, but there is the chief musician and the chief singers, so that music and singing must go together.
Ques. In Nehemiah, when the singers sang loud, which suggests that the singing was in line with the music, the people rejoiced so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard afar off.
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. What is the difference between singing with the spirit and with the understanding?
J.T. Singing with the spirit alludes to what wealth you have; it is that in which you are near to God; God has given us our spirits; I mean it is a peculiar matter, the spirit of a man; it is not from his parents, it is peculiarly from God. The spirit returns to God who gave it. It is that in which we are near to God; it is really the greatest part in man, spirit first, then soul, and then body. So that I think it would allude to the wealth one has, really what one has in his song, and the understanding would mean he knows the right time to use it, or it is governed by proper music.
Ques. There can be real music in a good 'Amen', can there not?
J.T. Well, the 'Amens' are always part of the singing in the psalms; you will notice you get it at the end of each book; it says let all the people say it.
{133}
H.H. We would like to hear more of them.
J.T. Quite so.
M.W.B. You referred a little while ago to the paucity of hymns in the actual taking part in assembly service. Would you say a little more as to that? It is sometimes asserted that there are too many hymns, rather deprecating the idea of hymn singing.
J.T. What we have been saying ought to help. I suppose singing with the spirit would imply the spiritual wealth one has; the understanding would imply how I use it, to use it at the right time and to use the right kind of tune. I know very little about music myself, but I can see that intelligence would include the right time for the hymn and right music. What I had in mind in referring to the paucity of hymns was that I observe, in moving about, that there is one hymn, then the breaking of bread and all that attaches to it, then another hymn, maybe to the Father, immediately after the box is passed, and there are no hymns about the Lord's relations with His bride, with the assembly, few or no hymns as regards the other offices of Christ that are all operative and in which He is functioning in the assembly. That is what I mean. The Lord has furnished us with these hymns in some measure and I believe they should be used.
M.W.B. I am thankful you have raised the exercise. It would make room for the development of the service of God on those lines which would prepare the soul for further advance.
J.T. Quite so, the Lord is ready to move us on, but He would have us move on in wealth.
Ques. Would the dancing correspond more with spiritual emotions, or, being filled, you bubble up, as it were?
J.T. The figure would mean, I think, that your whole being is brought into the thing, you are brought into it in your whole moral being. We are
{134}
told that David danced with all his might, but he was clothed in a linen ephod, meaning he was sober and balanced in it.
Ques. Does it involve the appreciation of the precious glories of Christ one after the other? In the books of psalms these various glories come out one after the other.
J.T. Very good. There is much of that omitted by us; the Lord is amongst us and His varied glories ought to be before us. The contemplation of them involves enrichment.
Ques. Does the fatted calf and the killing of it enter into that?
J.T. Quite. It is not easy to bring that into assembly service, but there is of course the thought of feeding in the Lord's supper.
Ques. Would the breaking of the bread be a suitable moment to speak to the Lord of the assembly? Where would the love of Christ for the assembly come in in the morning meeting?
J.T. It comes in in the bread, only it is the thought of His devotedness, "This is my body which is for you" @1 Corinthians 11:24 -- it comes in there, but it may come in more fully, as it is said, we are to be to Another, "who has been raised up from among the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God", @Romans 7:4. Some of us lately were speaking of the elements that enter into the service of God, even before we have the sanctuary mentioned formally; it is mentioned as the abode of His holiness, in @Exodus 15, and it is properly introduced in chapter 25, but before that we have suggestions of sonship: the service is to be at a certain mountain and Jethro brings his daughter Zipporah and his two sons to Moses before we come to Sinai, before we come to the place where the service is to begin. So it seems to me these elements ought to be with us in regard to assembly service, it is a question now of the elements that make up the
{135}
service, that they are equal to assembly service, then the order of it will come into place. If we let in the great thoughts that God has furnished for our enrichment, I think all else will come clearly before us.
Ques. Would it be in keeping to say a word in regard to @Mark 14, "When they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives"? @Mark 14:26.
J.T. That is clearly after the Supper is partaken of; there is collective elevation, what we do ourselves; the spiritual movement is of ourselves and there is power there.
Ques. Is that hymn to God?
J.T. All would be to God there, even the Lord's thanksgiving. You cannot make it all fit. We cannot just say whether the Lord spoke to Jehovah, I suppose He spoke to the Father; but our instruction first lies in what we are taught in the epistles in regard to this. So it is *the Lord's* supper, and we speak to Him rightly; it is to the Lord.
Ques. Why does it say 'household' in the end of this passage in @Ephesians 2?
J.T. I think because it brings God very near to us, not simply that we are in the house, but we ourselves are the household.
Rem. It is like a family.
J.T. Exactly.
M.W.B. Is it more intimate really than the living stone? That is a very concrete idea and living is connected with it.
J.T. I think it is. Peter, of course, is speaking by contrast, for he is speaking to Jewish saints who would understand the idea of the stone in the temple, and he is making them living ones. And then, being built up a spiritual house, all that is contrast, over against what they were accustomed to at Jerusalem; then the holy priesthood, bringing in the side of intelligence, the service of God. "To offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ".
{136}
But Ephesians is the most exalted thought, I believe, we have had, because it is the saints viewed as already belonging to heaven, seated there, seen now here below as forming the habitation of God and that we are His household.
{137}
SAMUEL'S JUDGESHIP
@1 Samuel 7:3 - 17
J.T. The proposal in reading this passage is to call attention to Samuel, the last of the judges, as setting out more fully than any of them the thought of judgeship amongst the people of God. It is a suggestion of how the end of a thing is better than the beginning, and is an encouragement to us, as coming at the end, to aim at the fulness of the divine thought in the dispensation. Much is made of Samuel's early life in this book, of his parentage, particularly his mother, and how Jehovah saw to it that he acquired moral weight among the people; He did not allow his words to fall to the ground; God took care of that. He was known as a prophet from Dan to Beer-sheba and what he said came to pass. That is, what is stressed in Samuel is the reality of his personality according to God and of his gift and mission, so that there can be no question about him, no reasonable question raised up against him. If the people are not satisfied, if they wish for another, they have to resort to subterfuge, they can hardly complain of himself. So that he stands out, it seems, as a model for us in the last days as equalling, or more than equalling, the first judge, who, I suppose, is Othniel. I think all would remind us that there should be no haziness or doubtfulness as to things or persons, that each of us should be known, clear, transparent, that, whatever our service, we are in it rightly and suitably and efficiently -- it is not a time for anything else. The ark here was not cared for properly; it had been captured and now was not in the proper surroundings, a solemn matter for anyone who, like Samuel, regards Jehovah. So that, these facts being stated, the position of the ark
{138}
comes in and Samuel begins his ministry formally. He had ministered already, but evidently now it is in relation to the general state of the people and the position of the ark, and this passage is to give us a life picture of him, not from his infancy for that has been already given but as the judge -- and how effective he was! That is, it was the kind of ministry needed for the moment, whatever preceded it, and the Spirit of God gives a full portrait of it right down to the end of his life, and how effective it was.
A.J.G. Have you in mind that this is a ministry dealing with the moral condition of the people as preparing the ground for what was subsequently brought in under David and Solomon?
J.T. Exactly, there is nothing clearer than that. So he spoke to all the house of Israel saying, "If ye do return unto the Lord with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the Lord, and serve him only" (that word 'only' is to be noted) "and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines". "Serve him only", that is, you might say, the first great result of the ministry needed for the moment. It is this double-mindedness that we have to judge in ourselves. He stresses "Jehovah only".
A.J.G. Is the epistle to the Romans, in the teaching of it, made effective so that we are secured as bondmen to God?
J.T. Quite so, no other master.
C.H.P. And would Corinthians come in on the collective side in regard to idols and going on in relation to what is positive as to fellowship?
J.T. Quite so, that is what is stressed in that letter. The Lord is jealous: it says, "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?" @1 Corinthians 10:22. It is not that they were giving Him over altogether, but they were taking on something additional.
{139}
Ques, When it says, "All the house of Israel lamented after the Lord", does it indicate some idea of returning to God?
J.T. Yes, it would show the Lord was moving, and Samuel's ministry comes in to take advantage of that. "The time was long", it says; the allusion is to the ark and feelings about the ark.
P.L. Is it such a strait that moves God to raise up distinctive ministry like Samuel's? His state would make room for it subjectively, the ark standing for that. Would that be a basic state for recovering ministry?
J.T. The sort of soil, you would say, for ministry is symbolised by agriculture, "The earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it". @Hebrews 6:7. This kind of soil will take in ministry such as Samuel's and bear fruit, and that really was in mind here, so that they act against idolatry and come back to Jehovah to serve Him only; Then there is the idea of gathering, for gathering an unjudged people is useless, it is those who judge themselves -- "Gather all Israel" -- he has nothing less than all in mind -- "to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you unto the Lord. And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the Lord". There is the full acknowledgment of the state: they "fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the Lord", that is, where they are gathered. And then we are told that "Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh". This now is the full course where he would have them. It is a peculiar statement, "He judged them there", because, although we may make a general admission and take up a generally right position, there are details that have to be settled. Do you not think so?
A.J.G. Yes. I was wondering whether the being there means that details as they arose would be dealt with by the light that that position stands for.
{140}
J.T. That is, I think, what is meant, judging in detail. They have already taken up a right place provisionally and collectively, but that is not the whole matter, the ministry must proceed and for dealing with details, judgment like this is needed.
P.L. John fell at His feet as one dead; is that the general position, at the Lord's feet, but then travelling round the churches with Him, would that be the details coming up?
J.T. Very good.
A.J.G. What is the particular significance of Mizpeh in this connection?
J.T. It would be the sense of watching, the idea of remembering entering into it. Ministry takes up its own attitude under God; it takes up its own position and moves from its own point of view. You may marvel at the difference of one ministry from another, but it has its own way and the result proves its efficiency, that it is of God. That is, we have to recognise the position taken up in any ministry.
Ques. Will you say a little as to the character of the judgment, does it refer to matters belonging to Jehovah?
J.T. Whatever needed judgment. Moses in @Exodus 18 may be taken to represent the idea; he sat all day and listened to people coming to him with this and that. Jethro, his father-in-law, gave him advice about it, which he took: but it is onerous work, a detailed matter, and the saints need it. It is not enough that we take up a generally right position. They poured out water before Jehovah and turned from idols outwardly, but there are a lot of secret things. If we are in the presence of God, where the ministry will have us, things may come out that are not of God and they have to be settled. We have to ask, What is the bearing of this thing that has happened? We are constantly faced with matters
{141}
and it is a great thing to have them settled in a moral way, and I think that is what is in mind in judgeship. The principle is that whenever God raised up a judge God was with the judge. It is wisdom to recognise that each judge has his own distinctiveness and his own circuits, and Samuel, it seems to me, is the outstanding one who represents the idea more than any; and this position at Mizpeh would mean that brethren are faced now with the presence of God in a suitable person. He may rise to be a type of Christ even, but he judged Israel there in his own selected place.
H.L. Does something lie behind that in Samuel himself? His ministry was very effective almost immediately. Had he faced things in his own soul?
J.T. I doubt if anyone could be a judge save as he judges things in himself.
A.J.G. And is the particular exercise of judgeship necessary to clear the way for the ministry of the prophets?
J.T. That is how it stands. "Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh". That is all a question of the rights of God, I think, in each of us individually. We are challenged in such a ministry as to detail. Each one has his own difficulties in his soul and Samuel is there and he judges; it is not the infliction of penalties, but in the sense in which God is going to judge the world presently by this Man whom He has ordained, entering into detail because everything must be settled. Then the enemy comes up -- that is the next thing -- so we do well to deal with secret moral issues.
Ques. What is the point of the Philistines hearing of this matter? They heard Israel was gathered together.
J.T. The point is God is moving. If a christian goes to the theatres or cinemas or stays at home and plays cards, the enemy will not trouble him; but
{142}
when we gather under these circumstances the enemy does not like that, for God is there; and Samuel knows what to do in that matter too. There is no difficulty, no unsolvable matter at all; the enemy is coming up in force and Samuel knows what to do. But the people are to go through all this; it says, "They were afraid of the Philistines. And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the Lord our God for us"; that is, he had been doing it; they know the kind of man he is.
P.L. Would it be that a warrior leading in a universal conflict has acquired the confidence of the saints in patience connected with moral issues in a locality?
J.T. Illustrate what you mean.
P.L. Well, the one who was promoted in the battle in the valley Elah is a David who went into details in moral questions: in shepherd care the lion and the bear were met in what you might call a more local setting. Samuel, before giving a lead in general battle, qualified by way of moral issues, do you think? And he had the mind of God in them.
J.T. The people understand their leader, they understand what his characteristic is, he is a praying man, his prayers are perhaps more valuable than anything.
Ques. Is it the word of God and intercession going together?
J.T. Exactly, he spoke the word of God to them; now he is interceding for them. They know he can do it; evidently he had acquired that reputation.
Ques. Does he support them as priest in praying for them, and as a prophet in connection with their recovery?
J.T. Yes, his real ministry is prophecy, but he is a priest too, but under the general title of a judge.
{143}
He is a man of great parts, great endowment from God, qualifications for the office; and it is a great matter if in any locality or generally there are those who can serve, that the brethren should know just what they can do. To every man his work, and, if the saints are at all alert, they will see what a man can do and ask him to help on those lines. The great general principle in service is Christ, Christ here available for anyone, "I am among you as he that serveth". @Luke 22:27. Whatever I can I will do, that is the principle for a servant, and Samuel has a wide range of ability here and evidently the people understood.
Rem. We would be particularly thankful for such elements as that to be found among us in view of the fact that any desire or exercise to move collectively in matters draws the attention of the enemy. "When the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel". They did not regard as a small matter the saints moving together on collective lines.
J.T. This movement of God we have part in now is apparently outwardly small, but the lords of the Philistines heard of it a hundred years ago and have been active ever since. The great comfort about Samuel is that his ministry was effective all the days of his life, it did not break down. It is a very effective ministry, rising up, you might say, to the ministry of Christ, and what is to be noticed is, I think, that the saints understand; they understand what is available to them in the ministry. They do not ask him to gird on his sword; David would do that, but Samuel's service is prayer, so they knew what he could do.
Ques. What does the Philistine represent to us?
J.T. Well, the big man, the religious man in the land, in the same position as ourselves outwardly, but he is secretly against us. It is that kind of thing.
{144}
Rem. It is a great thing to recognise the man whom God is with.
J.T. Quite so, and the saints here understood what Samuel could do; they did not ask him to gird on his sword. They asked him to do what they knew he could do: they asked him to pray for them, which he did. That was the thing he did when they rejected him. He said, "God forbid that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you". @1 Samuel 12:23.
Rem. That suggests a man of prayer.
J.T. Quite so.
Rem. Do you mean the spirit of judgeship would know what was required at any given juncture? He could take the sword when required and slay Agag.
J.T. That is good. I believe that with any ministry that God raises up, He gives discernment as to what is needed, the battleground on which it can be carried on. Mizpeh is a selected spot, the saints are there, and he is judging there. Now the saints understand what is in this man, and they use it -- why not? After all, "Ourselves your servants for Jesus¬ sake", @2 Corinthians 4:5 whether it was Paul or Apollos or Cephas, all was for the service of the saints. Why not use them? Of course you have to remember they are men, but still, that is the position -- use them aright.
Ques. Do you think, "prepared unto every good work" @2 Timothy 2:21 would be the way all-round efficiency is arrived at?
J.T. Exactly. Let no one say, I am a specialist; there is nothing of that kind in Scripture. Not that a man may not be that in effect, but he does not take that ground; he is an all-round man. The Lord said, "I am among you as he that serveth". @Luke 22:27. He was known among the brethren as One who served. It is wonderful to think what the Lord would do.
{145}
If He will wash the disciples¬ feet what will He not do? Think of the Lord Jesus ready to do that!
Ques. How would the opposition of the Philistines show itself today?
J.T. One thing about them is they are big men, another is they pride themselves: if they have ancestry, they will tell you about it; if they have money, they will tell you about it. Anything that gives man a place, they will make a show of it; they do not hide it -- that is another thing. You will find that in yourself; I find it in myself, how ready I am to bring out any little thing that adds to me as a man here.
Ques. Would the antidote to that be drawing the water, as the people did here, speaking of the Spirit and the ministry?
J.T. Alluding to verse 6? Of course it is a type of themselves, they poured it out before Jehovah. I suppose it would mean that, as far as we are concerned, the water would be lost entirely in oblivion. It says in @2 Samuel 14, it cannot be gathered up again; it does not say that here. I think there is a thought of resurrection in it, that it can be gathered up again, what seems to disappear in the earth can be gathered up again. God will see to that. I think there is some little light in what they do here. A man goes down and is buried; as the infidels would say, he just returns to dust. Scripture says that too. What about his identity? I think there is a reference here to the fact that it can be gathered up, though there is not much said about it.
P.L. Would it be gathered up in the savour of the burnt offering, the sucking lamb?
J.T. That brings out what we are saying: it is the whole idea, and that runs through. The passover is the great sacrificial thought and what is stressed in it is, "A bone of him shall not be broken". @John 19:36. Taken up in John's gospel, we see that the whole thought
{146}
goes through; God will give it a body, God will cover it. So it is parallel with Joseph's bones mentioned in the next chapter in Exodus, the identity of the person going right through; in Christ all is gathered up, believers are all in Christ, "In Christ shall all be made alive". @1 Corinthians 15:22.
Ques. It says they poured it out before Jehovah, would that show they had faith in Jehovah?
J.T. I think there is that element there, though not stressed. After all, what is conversion or anything, aside from being gathered up, taken up in Christ?
Ques. Do you think we should be likely to appreciate the sucking lamb as a whole burnt offering if we had not come to the realisation of our powerlessness as suggested in the water poured out? Is not one, so to speak, a corollary of the other?
J.T. It seems so. It seems that the light comes in in the work of God in the people discerning what is in Samuel, that he would pray for them; that would bring in the power of God. Then the whole idea in such an attractive way, a sucking lamb, what is dependent, so beautifully typical of Christ who was cast on God from the very outset of His being here below; the whole thought carried through, all delightful from the outset and now in heaven, all is gathered up in Him.
P.L. So that, as you say, self-judgment would be valueless if it were not gathered up. In the great penitential psalm, the 51st, David pours out his soul and finishes up with the whole burnt-offering.
J.T. Yes, and Zion comes in at the end too.
Rem. So that Samuel's judging would be for the preservation of what is of God as much as the discerning of what is not.
J.T. Quite so, the judging would mean that God is to have us apart from all that naughtiness of will.
{147}
P. L. So that the keeping of the feast of unleavened bread of sincerity and truth in Corinthians is to enable us to merge in the vessel which is one entity and which is going through, the assembly.
J.T. "Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump" -- there is the one idea -- "according as ye are unleavened". @1 Corinthians 5:7. There is the abstract idea -- a remarkable thing that in the mind of God we are unleavened. But the judging would mean that all that is contrary to what we are abstractly before God is dealt with; it is all extraneous, and if it appear in our ways, it is a service to us if one calls attention to it, and let us have done with it.
Ques. Is there not a suggestion in the first thought of being saved out of the hands of the Philistines? Samuel prayed for that, but later the people asked for it. Was his judgeship and ministry to bring the people round to what was hindering them?
J.T. I think so. The whole position became clear to them after Jehovah thunders. "The men of Israel", it says: now they are *men*, they have developed into that. "The men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Beth-car". That is the idea of making a finished matter of it. God has done wonderfully, but then He will bring us into what He is doing; that is really the essence of the whole position that God brings us into what He is doing, and anything we can do, let us do it. He could have done all this Himself, but He did not, the men of Israel must be brought into it.
Ques. Is Samuel's movement an answer to the movement of the people? The people poured out the water and Samuel offered the burnt-offering.
J.T. I think that is right; it is the positive side; all is gathered up in Christ, one whole thought, and God, taking that on, thunders on what is contrary; He is against what is contrary, the big man, but then
{148}
He leaves some of it to us. I have to gird on my armour and get my sword and finish the matter -- which they did. You find later, in Saul's case, in the great battle with the Philistines, Jonathan was used and the matter was not finished. The reason was, as Jonathan pointed out, they did not get food; Saul in his folly forbade them to take anything, and Jonathan points out that if they took the honey the matter would be finished.
Ques. Will you say a little more as to the distinction between "the children of Israel" in verse 8, and "the men of Israel" in verse 11?
J.T. I thought it is a very remarkable way of putting it -- "the men of Israel". The Lord speaks of "the men whom thou gavest me" @John 17:6 and we read of David's men and the men of Hezekiah, and so on. It alludes to the progress that has been made; the men of Israel went out; they are not sent out. Manhood means you are coming into the thing.
Rem. Do you think there is a tendency, if the enemy recedes a little, to give up and not pursue? Pursuing suggests energy in following up the matter to a conclusion.
J.T. Quite so, "Faint yet pursuing" @Judges 8:4, you will finish the matter; and that works out in many ways amongst us. You may say, There is nobody in this meeting who can preach or teach; we are in a poor way. But then we are all called into the matter. God is working, and if a thing has to be done I will do it, and if I take up that line God will help me, things will be done.
P.L. "I have not found thy works perfect". @Revelation 3:2.
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. In following things up like that should we look to secure something positive as well? The cities were restored to Israel.
J.T. That is the next thing. The next paragraph begins with verse 12, but it is well to notice what
{149}
these men did without being told. People say, It is not my business. If there is something to be done and you cannot do it, the thing is to ask God to help you to do it, and it will be done. That word 'Beth- car' has some meaning in relation to knowledge, I think, so the full idea of intelligence is brought into it.
Ques. Would you say that the fact that they went out of Mizpeh without being told is the result of Samuel's judging there, so that the brethren know what to do without specific instructions?
J.T. Exactly, they are set up as men. After the Lord's supper they sang a hymn. It does not say the Lord told them what to do, they knew what to do. If there be a heart for things the Lord loves to allow us to do things.
A.J.G. Does this exercise promote manhood?
J.T. I think that is the idea, to promote manhood in the brethren, as it is said of the early christians, "They persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles". @Acts 2:42. And they went beyond Beth-car -- they smote them as far as below Beth-car.
Ques. What are we to understand by this direct action of Jehovah as preceding the men smiting?
J.T. I think it is His delight in the whole burnt-offering. The meaning is that the lamb is defenceless; it is what God would delight in, and what God delights in He defends; the people come in under that. And it goes on to say, "Samuel cried to Jehovah for Israel, and Jehovah answered him ... . And Jehovah thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were routed before Israel". And then this verse 11 shows that the people are now *men*, they are working with God. We are all called into it, to be workers with God, and that is the idea, I think.
P.L. Have you something as to this in regard to the beginning of the Acts? The Lord's going up to
{150}
heaven in the savour of the burnt-offering, His precious death, and then the Spirit's coming down in power, and the ministry of the twelve; is that a routing before Israel? Would Stephen, and finally Paul, be amongst the men of Israel who followed up?
J.T. Yes, and the scattered saints are a very remarkable illustration; they had no commission at all, they were scattered at the time of Stephen's death, but they went and preached; they forced God an entrance into the enemy's territory as far as Antioch. But it says, "Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord": @Acts 9:1 that is a terrible state of things, and yet they are out at Antioch preaching the gospel, and Philip was in the wilderness and comes as far as Caesarea, a great result in those who had no commission at all, but they are acting in spite of persecution. Then the Lord takes the matter up and straightens the whole line, He brings down Saul of Tarsus; then, we are told, the assemblies in all these positions had peace; there was a forward movement.
J.R. Does the enemy appear to move in a wrong moment here as to his advantage? "As Samuel was offering up the burnt-offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel".
J.T. Quite so. Saul is yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter, but the Lord waited till he got near Damascus where the work was going on, and brought him down; he is brought back to Jerusalem and introduced to the apostles.
A.J.G. All this follows on the exercise arrived at previously to serve Jehovah only; it is God now operating as a result of what is arrived at by His people.
J.T. I am sure that is the leading thought, to serve Jehovah only. "A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways" @James 1:8; you really never reach christianity spiritually if you are double-minded.
{151}
H.L. And they did not take the credit to themselves. "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us". Is that a good conclusion?
J.T. Quite so, it is a landmark really. "Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer, saying, Hitherto hath the Lord helped us". And then it says, "So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel", so that the position is very clear, there is a complete victory; the territory is secured.
A.J.G. Does this word 'hitherto' involve that Samuel had in mind they would go yet further? God had helped them to that point, but they were to move still further.
J.T. Quite so, not settling down on their lees; so real judgeship is seen there. He does not sit down as after a great victory, he is moving every year. He "judged Israel all the days of his life. And he went from year to year in circuit to Beth-el, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places. And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the Lord". It is a life-size picture of Samuel.
P.L. And does "year by year" suggest that God is, so to speak, continually unfolding fresh phases of the truth to us, so that the sieve gets smaller and the standard more searching? What He allowed one year He would not the next, would He?
J.T. That is what has happened amongst us; the Lord seems to be making things clear; customs and practices which were accepted as right years back we do not accept now, because the judgment is there, I hope.
A.J.G. And would this going round in circuits to Beth-el and Gilgal and Mizpeh mean that standards
{152}
of truth have to be continually reasserted and the judgments relating to them?
J.T. Very good. Elijah and Elisha carried on this thought of going from one point to another.
A.A.G. Do these years answer to the early years of Samuel's life when year by year his mother brought him a little coat, indicating growth and the need of adjustment continually?
J.T. Yes, she would recognise that Samuel was growing.
A.A.G. I thought he was conscious of having learnt that principle in himself and he sees the need of it in the people.
J.T. I believe that is the secret of so much weakness with us that the young amongst us have not had these early experiences. We need to look back and ask ourselves, How have I got on? Do I look at things as I did last year?
P.L. Stock-taking in that way. Would the circuit be completed exercise, no loophole left?
J.T. It may be a sort of allusion to love's sphere. The Lord looked round in a circuit on those who sat around Him, as if He were pleased with them.
P.L. Yes, and the judicial service here is to encircle the saints with light and help and not to scatter them.
J.T. I suppose, as he came round to Beth-el, which is mentioned first, he would raise the whole question as to what was suitable to the house of God, as Paul does to Timothy. "That thou mayest know how one ought to conduct oneself in God's house". @1 Timothy 3:15. How are matters in that relation? Is there any joy for the young people to hold them, to attract them? If our conditions are kept right, there will be something to make the meetings attractive for young people, music and dancing, and other things too. Samuel would raise questions every time he came as to anything that might be out of the way.
{153}
P.L. Would he start at the top: "A habitation of God in the Spirit", @Ephesians 2:22 as in Ephesians; and then the Colossian aspect, in Gilgal and in Mizpeh coming down to Corinthians?
J.T. Yes.
Ques. What about Ramah?
J.T. Well, that is Samuel's own abode, alluding to moral elevation, I think. The two who followed the Lord said, "Rabbi ... where abidest thou?". He said, "Come and see". @John 1:38,39. I suppose Samuel would be ready for any Israelite to come and see him.
Ques. Is that suggestive of the ministry being maintained at its height?
J.T. You ought to see ministry at its height in Ramah.
P.L. Paul spoke of "my ways as they are in Christ". @1 Corinthians 4:17. When Samuel went to Bethlehem they trembled.
J.T. It is a good thing to fear if things are not right.
Ques. Are we not made to feel that the nearer we get to the light the more we must be prepared for discipline?
J.T. I think so. We have sidelights on Samuel's visits. People are invited as if they are to have a happy time; the maidens know all about it, they are not occupied with social affairs, but with spiritual affairs. They know all about the man of God in the town, what he does: he blesses the sacrifice, and then they have thirty people invited.
Rem. Samuel honoured Jehovah and then he was able to build an altar unto Jehovah.
J.T. Yes, that is another thing. But it is nice to see how he comes in and how a happy state of things is promoted; for our meetings are not much marked by spiritual happiness. But he goes to Bethlehem and things are different: they feared him.
{154}
P.L. The fact that he had to bring the heifer with him suggests the feminine side, as seen with the young women in Scripture.
J.T. Very good. That gives character to David's anointing too; so if Christ has not His place, as was the case in Jesse's house, we have good reason to fear.
Ques. Would Ramah suggest that his house was in keeping with the house of God?
J.T. I think that is the way the thing would work out. I suppose the place where he resides is abstractly the assembly; that is where you would go for right thoughts and principles; you would see them concretely there. It is better to go and see them than to be taught them. So that there was not only that, but there was worship; there he built an altar to Jehovah, he judged Israel there too; that means you can go there, and if you go to Samuel's abode, you must be judged on those principles that marked his place.
Rem. Something like Deborah -- they came to her for judgment.
J.T. Quite so. We learn as to Samuel's place, Naioth and Ramah, as mentioned later (@1 Samuel 19), what powerful influence there was: even Saul is brought down by the prophetic ministry.
Rem. Does it suggest that Samuel had living conditions outside his service? While he was available in his own place to judge Israel, his actual living conditions were in relation to God and his approach there.
J.T. I think that is good. Every servant's house ought to be available to the brethren in so far as possible. He should entertain, for his house should be a testimony where what is right may be learnt.
P.L. Like Paul receiving every one, and the altar there.
{155}
J.T. Exactly, in his own hired house; he had full rights there.
Rem. You would expect the people who came to Paul at the end of the Acts would not only receive ministry from him, but they would hear him pray.
J.T. Quite.
Rem. A little like the Lord Himself retiring to the mount of Olives at night time and coming back from that standpoint to minister in the temple.
J.T. And that word in @Mark 2:1 "He entered again into Capernaum after several days, and it was reported that he was at the house"; the expression "at the house" may be rendered 'at home'. There is no doubt He had a dwelling-place in Capernaum. According to Matthew, He left Nazareth and came to Capernaum; and Mark says He was at home; but there was abundant liberty for anybody. They broke through the roof to get to Him. So no servant is to be a recluse. What a man is in his house ought to be a testimony.
Rem. In that connection another scripture says He had not where to lay His head.
J.T. That is to be taken in its own setting. We know He had a place in Bethany where He was loved.
Ques. Would you distinguish between the judgment in a circuit in these localities and then the judgment in his house?
J.T. I should. I should look for something special in Samuel's house where was his home, where he has full rights.
Ques. Would the first have more reference to us in our own particular localities?
J.T. I think so.
P.L. Would not this, "in his own house" bear also on the recent measuring line the Lord is supplying in ministry in view of the service of God; the building of the altar following this judging of Israel
{156}
in Ramah? Would it not be the upward trend in view and the raising, as you were pointing out, of moral questions pre-eminently with the saints?
J.T. Surely God must be the ultimate end of everything. God is supreme with Samuel, and Samuel is on sacrificial lines; not only that, in a general way, he served God only, but he was sacrificial in it; the altar means that.
P.L. "Jesus ... lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, Father". @John 17:1. Is that like the altar in his own house?
J.T. Yes.
Rem. He is not living in his own service; there is something greater than that.
{157}
THE NEED OF COMPLETION
@1 Samuel 7:10,11; @1 Samuel 14:23 - 30; @1 Samuel 15:1 - 3,7 - 9
I venture to put these three scriptures together to speak, as I hope for profit, on the divine requirement that any given work is to be *finished*. These scriptures are read in order to bring out the necessity of completing any work divinely entrusted, or in fact any work that may come to one's hand, for we are enjoined, "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might", @Ecclesiastes 9:10.
Now the positive word that I have is from chapter 7, which I intend to reserve for the end of my remarks and only to allude to briefly now so that you may see what is in mind, namely, that God gave a great victory to His people which might to most seem sufficient; we are told that He thundered upon the Philistines and discomfited them, a great matter in itself which seemingly ought to be regarded as a finished matter, but it says, you will observe, "And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, as far as below Beth-car". Jehovah is not said to have directed this; it is evidently the outcome of intelligence in the men of Israel that it was the divine thought that *they* should have part in this great matter. Not that Jehovah could not have finished the matter -- He could, readily. He could have destroyed *all* the Philistines. But He left the way open for such a movement as is recorded of the men of Israel: they "went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, as far as below [or beyond] Beth-car". They went the full length. I will come back to this presently.
I want to show from the second scripture, dear brethren, how the end in a given work or divine enterprise may be hindered, may not be reached by
{158}
us, and how we may stand in the divine way of reaching His end. God always has an end in mind; whether it be in enlightening one's soul, or whether it be in the introduction of the gospel, indeed, at the beginning, the formation of converts into an assembly or whatever it may be, God always has an end in mind. He intends to reach it and *will* reach it. But He brings His people into what He is doing. He deigns to regard us as "fellow-workmen"! Who does not normally as a christian aspire to be a fellow-workman with God! And you find that God sets the matter on and gives general results from His own side, but allows us to go forward, and in doing so has perfect delight in looking upon us in our little way in the field of service as *His* (no less than that) fellow-workmen!
Now this section in the second scripture I have read records a workman with God, a man who worked with *God*. Jonathan, we are told, "wrought with God". He did not work with his father; in fact it says that before he entered on the great undertaking at the beginning of this chapter 14 "he did not tell his father". @1 Samuel 14:1. The verses I have read show how wise this was. The chapter brings out that the end was not really reached, great as was the beginning and the victory in a general way. The full end was not reached. And why? Because of Saul interposing: *he* would have part in the victory, for the natural mind is ready to take part when things are successful in the service of God. It was a question with Saul of *his* enemies -- not *God's*. It was a question with him of being avenged on *his* enemies! Such a person intruding into a great divine matter can only hinder. In fact any part the natural mind has in divine operations, however apparently helpful at the outset, can only hinder in the end. Let us take note of that, dear brethren, because natural energy is not only useless, but it is *in the way*.
{159}
So Saul interposed with a curse. There was no need for it. In due course anyone interfering or taking a hand in the work of God on natural lines will expose himself, and will be found not only useless but in the way. Saul saw the work, that the victory was assured, why should *he* not have part in that? But was he a worker with God? On the contrary, dear brethren, he was a worker *against* God in this matter. And why? Because he assumed distinction; he assumed the ability; he assumed all that his outward position afforded him. And so he assumes the right to interfere with the food of the warriors of God, to deprive them of it! He interposed a curse, too; assuming the right, the religious right, of cursing anyone who disregarded his foolish edict! And the worker with God is happily unaware of this. Happy it is for us when we are working successfully with God if we are unaware of these fathers who would interpose their religious authority, if not to stop the work directly, at least to weaken the hands of those engaged in it.
We can thus understand the spiritual meaning of Jonathan refraining from telling his father of the great project he had on hand. He did not tell his father, we are told. It is happy to be ignorant of their assumed rights over us in the service of God. Jonathan was ignorant of this stupid edict, and oh! how many there are abroad today, dear brethren, based on self-importance, based on religious importance and authority. Whereas neither exists. Happy it is for us if we are ignorant of their self-imposed interference, their importance and consequent interference. Hence, if we are to be successful as workers with God, for Jonathan "wrought with God", *do not tell them*. The less they know the better. Jonathan did not tell his father, but nevertheless his father came into the matter and enjoined that the warriors
{160}
who were being used of God, workers with Jonathan, should not partake of the divinely provided food! It was divinely provided food. Think of depriving people of what has been divinely provided! It was the fruit of the land. The land that was to flow with milk and honey was flowing still with milk and honey: with honey certainly, for you will have observed in the chapter as I read it, in verses 25, 26, "And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey on the ground. And the people had come into the wood, and behold, the honey flowed; but no man put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath". Think of Saul, based on his self-importance, on his legality, too, think of that coming in between the warriors of God and the food that God provided, -- and provided richly!
Well now, dear brethren, you see what I mean. Jonathan says of his father here, "My father has troubled the land". There are many such. It is the land in a spiritual sense. He says, in effect, he has really robbed us of what was within our grasp, namely, the complete overthrow of the Philistines at this time.
You can see then, dear brethren, that if we are to be workers with God at this hour we must disregard all such fathers. If we are ignorant of their intervention it is happy, but if we come to know it we are not to fail to make it clear that it is an interference. In fact the whole hierarchical system (if you will allow me to say it here) is an interference with the work of God, to say nothing more than that. It is a positive interference. Time was when we could not meet like this. Why? Because of that interference!
Well then, dear brethren, as workers together with God, let us go on in happy ignorance of this interference. Not that we do not suffer, but go on with God, partaking of the honey, namely, the fruit of the land, for that is what it is. The land is constantly
{161}
referred to as *flowing* with milk and honey. And it is yet -- in a spiritual way. According to what we get here, there was honey upon the ground, and in verse 26 it says, "Behold, the honey flowed". There it was, flowing of itself. No culture needed; no bee-hives required. The land flowed with it. And this stupid curse of Saul's must deprive the workers with God of this divinely-given food, and hence deprive them of the complete victory that was within their reach!
Why I am saying all this is that we should be warned and be intelligent as to the situation today and know how to avail ourselves of the honey. There was not much needed. There was plenty of it, but even a little taken on the end of a staff is enough to enlighten the warrior's eyes, so that he may pursue the enemy, or, in other words, *complete* the work. It is a great reproach under all circumstances to be engaged in any work of God that is left unfinished. "I have not found thy works complete", says the Lord Jesus to Sardis, "before my God". They may seem to be complete before others, but God is the Judge of all. The final test must be what *He* thinks. And hence the Lord speaks on God's behalf to Sardis and says, "I have not found thy works complete before my God". @Revelation 3:2.
Now I go on to chapter 15 (much more might be said, of course, as to Jonathan's pronouncement on his father) to show how this incompletion of work divinely assigned is more fully seen in Saul's case. It is a question of self-judgment, really, in the antitype, a question of dealing with Amalekitish elements amongst the people of God. And here it may be that most of us are involved, whether it be each in his own self or in his family or in his business or in his service to the Lord. It is a question whether any of us would come out clear in the matter were we put to the test, as the Lord Jesus says, "before my God". @Revelation 3:2.
{162}
For that is how the matter is to come out. "Ye have come to ... God, judge of all", @Hebrews 12:23. We come to *Him*. Not to things and persons, but to *God*, the Judge of all, and everything must come under review before Him; if not now, in the future. Why not *now*? Why let things remain unsettled until that day when we shall appear before God? We must all appear, we are told, before the judgment-seat of God. But how happy it is to have everything settled up before that time! Not to have a long bill at the adjudication from God. "For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged", @1 Corinthians 11:31. Otherwise we shall be judged with the world. Not that the believer is not saved; the true believer *is*, but "so as by fire". @1 Corinthians 3:15. What a bill any such person has to face, putting things off day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year, until his life of responsibility is over! The volume is not lessened in the divine account; all is kept with the greatest accuracy in the books of God. The first book of this kind is said to be *God's* book. Moses refers to God's book; there can be no discrepancy *there*. So that, dear brethren, the continual putting off of things -- it is sorry work!
So it is a question now in @1 Samuel 15 of dealing with Amalekitish elements. Here they are specified: "Both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass". All living creatures, referring doubtless to active things, even an infant or a suckling, active Amalekitish elements. Let us see to it, dear brethren. It may be just the infant, the suckling -- something active. It may be the man, full, it may be assumed, of the intellectualism, the sophistication of this world. The woman, too, in all her secretiveness. And, as it is said, the "ox and sheep, camel and ass". Let us see to it whether there are any of these features with us; they are active things, *living* in that sense.
{163}
How hard-hearted it would seem to destroy a suckling, an infant! But this is the divine requirement, dear brethren. And Saul undertakes the commission. In fact, the end of the previous chapter gives us a full account of Saul from the human point of view, a very successful kind of monarch. Look at the list of things at the end of chapter 14, a very successful ruler. There are those who would excuse all else in the light of such military skill and ability, such rule. But the eye of God saw differently. And so it is with many of us; successful apparently, it may be, under the eye of our brethren, but the divine eye sees differently. There is something underneath all that, which the divine eye discerns and will bring to light, and that is chapter 15.
The Spirit depicts in remarkable words the exploits of this monarch: let anyone read those verses at the end of chapter 14 and he will see. He gives Saul full credit, but, as the Lord said to the young man, there was one thing lacking. Saul lacked many things, but this one thing would be enough before the bar of God. Samuel says, "The Lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel". What an honour to be anointed at all by God, to have part in His service amongst His people. What an honour! But, oh, beloved brethren, how all this may be taken on and in a measure there may be success and yet something never judged, and the work of God, therefore, with which one has been entrusted *not* fulfilled! So that God has to say to us, "I have not found thy works complete". @Revelation 3:2.
Samuel says, "Now therefore hearken unto the voice of the words of the Lord". That is the first verse. This is a new chapter. After we have Saul's apparently successful reign depicted, this is another view of the man. He accepts the commission, and apparently he is very successful, too, in the undertaking. He gathers a large army, and he warns the
{164}
Kenites (verse 6), crediting them with showing kindness to the children of Israel; and then we are told in verse 7, "Saul smote Amalek from Havilah as thou comest to Shur, which is opposite to Egypt". Well, you say, that is a great matter. A man may be used, you know, in the service of God and get converts, give excellent addresses and minister in many ways apparently with great success, but there is something underneath undiscerned by him (or if discerned, it is neglected) which is allowed to stay in its activities. And presently God brings up something that exposes the whole man. Not that Saul had not been exposed before to some extent, but not fully.
And so, after giving Saul full credit for what he had done, "Saul smote Amalek from Havilah as thou comest to Shur, which is opposite to Egypt", the Spirit of God goes on to say, in verses 8, 9, "And he took Agag the king of Amalek alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. And Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep and oxen, and beasts of the second bearing, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not devote them to destruction; but everything that was mean and weak, that they destroyed utterly". So you see, dear brethren, the matter is exposed, not perhaps to the unspiritual eye, but to the spiritual eye. Saul is exposed, and he loses the kingdom. His works were not found complete before his God. He has his explanation, his apology, to offer, but the fact remains that he is *rebellious*. That is at the bottom of it -- his will is at work. If Amalek is spared, it is the natural mind, the natural will, that does it. The best of things, what is humanly good, is retained, and what is mean and weak is destroyed. There is no credit in that, beloved. It is the Amalekite in the *best* of him, in *all that he is*, that is to be destroyed. You say, That is the flesh in a peculiar way. Yes, it is, but it is the
{165}
flesh. So that if we are at all honest with ourselves, we cannot but see that this has to be destroyed. As the apostle says, "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law; but with the flesh sin's law", @Romans 7:25. It can do nothing else. Why not destroy it then? It is simply Amalek. It can do nothing else but sin, that is to say act against God. For that is what sin is; it is lawlessness.
You can see, dear brethren, that I have somewhat made clear my thought. The idea here in Saul's case of not completing what is divinely given to us as work, and on the other hand how delightful it is to see a brother or a sister take up *what is left to be done*. The apostle spoke to Titus of leaving him to look after what was unordered. It is striking, indeed, in the epistles how much of that there is. The Corinthians were left with much unordered: what will they do? Will they take the matter on? No, they did *not* take the matter on. The Lord will test us by leaving *something*, even if He does it nearly all. He leaves *something*. What will you do? You may say, It is not my business. But it *is* your business; it is God's business. The Lord Jesus at the age of twelve said, "Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?" @Luke 2:49. It is *God's* business. Let no one say, It is not my affair. It *is* your affair. It is *God* affair, and if your hand finds it to do, it is your affair.
The men of Israel in chapter 7 had no commission as far as we see, but they "went out ... and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, as far as below Beth-car". You say, This was God's matter; why did He not thunder on the enemies, as we get in verse 10, and finish the matter? But then the thunder has no heart and affections; *you have*. He wants to test you as to whether you are *obedient in every* thing. Not simply in a general way, but in everything. It is *one* thing, you see, that exposes you. These men of Israel are to be noted. We are to
{166}
understand the beautiful expression in them here. We have been speaking of what came out in Saul, that legal man, that murderous man, too, as the facts show, whom God would not let off although he *nearly* destroyed the Amalekites. He did not do it altogether, and God would not let him off. "Obedience is better than sacrifice", @1 Samuel 15:22. Samuel says to him. Do not talk to Me about sacrifice, God says, as it were, if that one thing is not done. It is a test to your will.
So under Samuel, in chapter 7 we see *men* developing. It is a beautiful type of what flows from the influence of Christ. We get such an expression as "The men whom thou gavest me", @John 17:6. Earlier He spoke of them to His Father as "babes", and now He says, "The men whom thou gavest me". They became men under the influence of Christ and these men of Israel became men under the influence of Samuel. We are told that "Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life" @1 Samuel 7:15. In spite of Saul, he judged Israel. He judged Israel in circuit, too, and particularly in his own house. As if to say, 'You come to my house and see how things are. What my house is, is according to how I judge. I will think of you and judge you accordingly'. How the disciples proved this with Jesus! "Rabbi", they say, "where abidest thou?"; "Come and see", @John 1:38,39. He says. They would see *where* He abode and would see *what the abode was*, how He was at home.
And so here in @1 Samuel 7:2 we get, "And all the house of Israel lamented after Jehovah". And presently Samuel speaks the prophetic word and they gathered together to Mizpah, and poured water out on the ground before Jehovah. They did not say, It cannot be gathered up again. Not now. They understand what it is in the presence of Samuel. All that is of God *will* be gathered up again. "And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpah" @1 Samuel 7:6. That is, all the secrets are dealt with. He judged
{167}
them there where they were gathered in Mizpah. Have things gone into before God! Let us keep short accounts if we are to become *men*. Young people, keep short accounts with God, confess things to God; to the brethren, too, if need be, but to *God*. Have everything out with God.
And then the people have increasing confidence in Samuel; "Cease not to cry to Jehovah our God for us", they say to him. They are becoming *men*. The kingdom of God is marked by this, that is, the spirit of prayer. They were right; they had rightly gauged the great servant amongst them. "God forbid that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you", @1 Samuel 12:23 he says in chapter 12. He kept on praying for them.
Then @1 Samuel 7:9 offered a sucking-lamb, a type of Jesus, the dependent Man. Samuel offered it as a whole burnt offering to God. God must act in relation to *that*, and He does. But then He looks for men to battle as well as He. What an honour to fight *with* God! He had thundered on the Philistines, and now the matter is somewhat incomplete. God had chosen it so to bring out what was there. God delights to do this, to bring out what is of Himself in His people. He brought about conditions to bring out what was in Saul to judge, and here it is to bring out what is of Himself in His people. "And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, as far as below Beth-car". They *finished* the matter. It was a complete victory over the Philistines. And so, you will observe, "Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer, and said, Hitherto Jehovah has helped us". But *they* did something, the men of Israel. God brought circumstances into existence that drew out what was there, the beautiful result of the influence of Samuel. As I might say as applied to ourselves, the beautiful result
{168}
in manhood of the influence of Christ. And so the matter is finished, and the stone is set up and given a name, "Eben-ezer", "Hitherto Jehovah has helped us". And we read "the hand of Jehovah was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel". That is what I would impress on each of us here, that we should not be half-hearted, but go on to completeness, as it was here. "All the days of Samuel" are mentioned: that is, he is a man who *finishes*.
May God bless the word.
{169}
ADJUSTMENT BY DIVINE LIGHT
@1 Samuel 16: 1,6,7, 11 - 13; @2 Samuel 12:13 - 23; @John 21:15 - 19 (first clause)
The word that covers my subject is very familiar, it is the word 'adjustment'. There seems to be no need for it in the physical creation, in that designated as the worlds, which were framed by the word of God, the term 'worlds' covering what we call the universe, not only our universe or solar system, but all the worlds; they seem to move on without need of external adjustment; whereas in the moral system which is correlative, adjustment is constantly needed, and in using the word one has in mind perhaps a little more than it literally conveys, and that where it takes place, as needed, there is not only correction, but ability to go on according to one's best days, to go on according to the greatest light that one has received. I say the light received because though the true light now shines, we cannot assume to have received all of it. There is not only light in the sense in which John presents it, the true light which is Christ, He is the true Light, but there is that beautiful expansion of the thought in light from heaven. Of course Christ was light from heaven, for He came down from heaven, but the apostle Paul speaks of a light shining down from heaven; we cannot say all have received it, but it shines; it "shone ... round about me", @Acts 22:6 the apostle Paul says. It is, however, what we receive that is effective. Light comes in through the eye, and it is said "If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body will be light", @Matthew 6:22 no part dark, that is the light is allowed to shine unhinderedly through the appointed channel. One great principle in the work of God in us is that we allow Him His way, whether it be in an assembly, or in a person. We are to make way
{170}
for God, and if it be that light is shining, then let it shine in, not only round about us. It is according to this light, as it may have shone into any of us and been received, that, if adjustment takes place, we function according to that light, according to the light we enjoyed in our best days. Adjustment is thus what is positive, not simply correction, so that there is a resumption of functions that are proper to any one of us.
I have selected these three great servants of God, Samuel, David and Peter, as illustrative of what I have in mind, persons amenable to adjustment in the sense in which I have spoken of it. The fact that such men needed this is a solemn warning to all of us, even the most spiritual, for these are outstanding spiritual men and servants of God. What is in mind is not to call attention to their failures, but to their adjustments and their amenableness to adjustment, so that in result God lost nothing; He gained in each case. It is a sorrowful contemplation if one has to own that God has lost something in oneself. Now Samuel, as you will observe, kept on mourning for Saul; he had to do with Saul from the outset of his official service and he anointed him. Where a servant has a convert and that convert becomes distinguished, the servant is apt to remember and peculiar links are apt to spring up going beyond what is spiritual. It appears that Samuel was affected in this way so that he is out of accord for the moment with the mind of Jehovah. Jehovah had rejected Saul, we are told in the clause immediately preceding this chapter, and Samuel had not; he had done so officially, that is, he had done so as Jehovah's servant, as we might say in ministry. In the previous chapter he speaks by the word of Jehovah to Saul, he overlooks nothing, no language could be plainer, no message more faithful than the word he spoke to the defaulting king; Saul had rejected the Lord and the Lord had
{171}
rejected him from ruling over His people. The mind of God was perfectly plain, not only to Saul or anyone who heard Samuel speak, but above all, plain in Samuel's mind.
But then, dear brethren, what we say on the platform -- for in chapter 15 he speaks by the word of the Lord, it is ministry as it were -- what we say thus may be in every way right, but as soon as the service is ended our mind may be different, and that is what we have to guard against, and it is that in which Samuel failed here. Mourning is laudable under certain circumstances, certainly as in the case of Josiah, when Jeremiah mourned, and all the singing men and singing women mourned and made lamentation for him; he was worthy; but to mourn for Saul is another matter, for he is the man who failed God. He had a wonderful beginning in his official service, but he failed God. His failure is to be mourned, of course, but to mourn for him in the sense of friendship, because I once had strong personal links with him, is another matter; it has no place in the divine lamentations and that is where Samuel missed it. He mourned, we are told, for Saul when Jehovah had rejected Saul. This is a serious matter, as also in any similar circumstances, because other great services are to be rendered by Samuel, if not by Saul. Immediately another charge is given to him, and now we see the bearing of his mourning for Saul; we see that he has damaged his own soul. Let us never forget this, dear brethren, it is not simply the act, that which is external, but the damage we do to our own souls. This section is full of light, negatively and positively, it is one of the most remarkable sections in Scripture. It is a record of Saul's reign, and earlier the light came in of another man elected, so that the ruling man, the acting man, the distinguished man for the moment is already displaced, displaced in the mind of God.
{172}
This history of displacement is another matter that runs along with what I am saying, it is a matter of soul history, a history of displacement. We are told earlier that Samuel says to Saul, "Jehovah has sought him a man after his own heart, and Jehovah has appointed him ruler over his people; for thou hast not kept what Jehovah commanded thee", @1 Samuel 13:14. That was earlier light; this matter of displacement had already taken place in regard of Saul; in the mind of God, Saul was no more, as you might say. It was all over; be it a few days, or a few months, or a few years, that had nothing to do with it, it was all over in the mind of God. Now this history of displacement in our souls, dear brethren, is one of the most important points to take account of; I began my spiritual history with it, with displacement, and Samuel had light earlier, so that he had plenty of time for reflection, for being formed according to the light of the mind of God, the light of displacement involved that the active man was already dismissed and another appointed to rule, the other unnamed, but still another person. Let us get that into our minds, the active man is displaced in the mind of God. Then Samuel gets the word of God expressly for Saul, and he delivers it, as I said, most faithfully in chapter 15. Yet now he is mourning, and we are told that God has rejected Saul.
There is a new order of things coming in in the mind of heaven, and it ought to have been in the mind of Samuel, but he is out of accord for the moment; he has allowed the natural unduly; the links were strong but they were not altogether spiritual. You will observe in the previous chapter that even Saul induces Samuel to follow him; he turned again after him, after such a faithful message from God, which meant that he was no longer to be followed, he was to be regarded as a rejected man. But Samuel found tears enough to shed for him; he
{173}
mourned for him. They were not heaven's tears, they were not tears like those of Jesus, and now Jehovah rebukes him, He says to him, "how long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him?"
Then he gets another commission -- I want to speak of that just for a moment, dear brethren, as I have already alluded to it. But we see here how our souls become damaged more than we are aware of through natural links: they may be formed primarily in the spiritual sense -- but continuing too far and as the spiritual wanes, the links remain and our souls are damaged. These damages have to be repaired and the reparation of them implies adjustment not only in negative thought but that we pursue our best line, our best services, that we re-acquire our best tastes, our best sight, our best feelings. Now Samuel undertakes the commission, and he goes to Bethlehem. Now Jehovah says, It is the one I appoint. Remember, Samuel had the light of another in his soul according to chapter 13; another was there in the mind of God, already appointed. He was not a Samuel unborn, it was a David already there; already appointed to be ruler. Why is Samuel not looking for this man that is so pleasing to God? Has he forgotten what pleases God? Samuel knew well what pleased Jehovah; no one in his day pleased him more than he himself; he knew what was pleasing to Jehovah in an earlier day, in a ruler or in any servant; he himself was the best expression of the thing, but why this defect? Why is he looking for a different kind of man from himself, a man whom God so often approved? God had great pleasure in Samuel; He put him forward. He would not allow a word of his to fall to the ground; He liked him so well; He did indeed. The evidence is that he was looking for a man like Saul; that was what was in his mind. If I have been conscious of God's pleasure
{174}
in me why should I look for a different kind of man? Understand, dear brethren, I am not talking of myself, I am speaking of the principle. Why should I go far afield? I have the thing right by me. Why should Samuel have in his mind a different idea from himself? But he had, you see, and what is the secret of it? He was damaged by natural affection for a fallen servant; he would rather have Saul continue on even as he was. God says, 'I have rejected him, why are you mourning for him?'. Still God does not reject Samuel; He had too much pleasure in Samuel for that; He knew it was but a passing matter, and he was adjustable, he would be adjustable immediately; Jehovah knew that. He knows us all well, dear brethren, our capabilities, and He will have His way with us; He will bring us back to our best days, our best services, our best feelings, and He will do it quickly.
Well, Eliab appears, a fine-looking man, he is the man, "Surely the Lord's anointed is before him". *Before Him*, you notice; he is putting that man before Jehovah in his mind. Eliab is the ideal in his mind, and Jehovah is looking inside him, and He sees in Samuel's heart that he has missed the mark for the moment; he has the wrong man in his mind. Jehovah came to Samuel in the temple, you remember, and told him about Eli and Eli's sons; He displaced them in Samuel's heart but Samuel is allowing a man of that kind: a Saul comes back into his mind as his ideal. Jehovah says, 'That will not do, Samuel, I have not chosen him, you ought to know', So I ought, in my earlier days I would know. So Samuel has lost ground, and now I want to show you, dear brethren, without enlarging on him unduly, how quickly he recovers himself. He says to Jesse, "Are these all the young men?". No, Jesse says, there is another. Had Samuel looked around these young men? Had he questioned in his own mind
{175}
which of them was the selected of Jehovah? Had he asked Jehovah about it? It does not appear so. Jehovah says, 'It is the one I appoint', so that I am to be on the *qui vive* if I have been mourning for a Saul instead of God's man; let God help me or I am helpless. Samuel did not let God help him at first; he named Eliab by himself, and he missed the mark. So the others pass by. No, he says; he has learned so much now, he is adjusted already; he is now listening for Jehovah, and there is no selected one there at all. You see the plight we get into, dear brethren, by pursuing this line, there is no selected one at all in the house, a house without the anointed of God, without the selected one! Is he in Samuel's heart? Well, he is coming into his heart, but apparently in nobody else's heart at the moment. Samuel ought to have brought into the house, on his first visitation, the ideal of God, and spread it abroad among the whole company -- only Christ. Paul says, "Yet not I, but Christ liveth in me", @Galatians 2:20. Were it so with Samuel the ideal would be spread abroad, permeating the whole company; they did not miss David at all. It was a Christless company for the moment, solemn thing to say with a spiritual man like that there, but then he is adjustable, and so he says, "Send and fetch him". He wants the real Christ, he is ready for Him, he is perfectly amenable. Jehovah knows it. Send for him; let us wait till he comes in; there will be no sitting down till he comes in. No one but Christ will do now that Samuel is adjusted. He is adjusted not only negatively, not only has he judged himself for naming the anointed without Jehovah, but he is adjusted positively; he wants Christ, the real Man, and so David comes in. There he is, there is no question about it, but Jehovah says, I am not going to trust Samuel yet. He says, Samuel, rise, anoint him, he is the one.
{176}
That is all I have to say about him save to add that Samuel went to Ramah. It is all over now, Christ is in His place; we can never have anything right until Christ is in His place. Samuel can be right now, he says, I will be right at Ramah, that is where I used to judge Israel. That is where he did judge Israel, and he will do it better than ever before now that Christ is in His place.
Now I go on to David, that is as a great sinner. It is very humbling indeed, dear brethren, to look around and observe how much of this kind of thing there is happening in a greater or lesser degree, but the Spirit of God would never tell us about this sin of David were it not that it was a man like David, a man that took it up so wonderfully, so gracefully, and who was restored and adjusted so perfectly. It is as if God would say, I love the very thought of the way that man has recovered himself. David has to suffer, as Peter has to suffer, for our sakes; it is all for our sakes, that these things are recounted. Has God nothing in this? Yes, He has a great deal in Samuel's adjustment, and more in David's adjustment. It was a great sin, but Nathan comes to him and he pictures the sin; it is God in grace making it as easy as possible for the sinner to repent; He always does that, makes it as easy as possible for the mind and for the conscience of the sinner to repent. It is grace that such a servant should be sent to him with such a parable. All this originated in heaven; it was heaven's way of meeting this great sinner, but he was met perfectly and he answered to it perfectly. Has God no pleasure in all this? He had pleasure in Nathan's service; He had pleasure in David's word, "I have sinned", as he says here, "I have sinned against Jehovah". How ready he was, but we can understand it, it was David. We should never have the account had it been a man like Saul; God would have no pleasure in parading before unborn
{177}
millions such a degrading sin as this. No, beloved, He would never do it were it not in a man like David, just to bring out what David is; it is to bring out what I and all christians are by the work of God; that is the idea. God allows things to bring out what He effects. He has pleasure in all that; be the sin ever so abominable, ever so degrading, God has pleasure in His own work. That is the point, it comes out immediately, and shines brilliantly at once, "I have sinned against Jehovah", he says. No equivocation whatever, no conditions at all, no excuses, it is simply a confession that he had sinned against Jehovah, as he says, "Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight". We should never have had @Psalm 51 if this had not happened, and we could never have had that psalm if it had not happened in David. These sins have happened in many, but in a David they have happened according to divine ordering, it must yield to the book of Psalms, the sweet psalmist of Israel has to say to the result, it belongs to the service of God. The psalm ends, "Build thou the walls of Jerusalem". @Psalm 51:18. That is to say the man is brought back; he is not only corrected, and judged himself, but, as the passage shows, he goes back to his best days; he worships God. There is no higher thought, beloved than that: he worshipped God. The great end that God has in mind today in all that is happening is that we might worship God, He is seeking worshippers, and He has such a worshipper now in David as He could not have had before.
I want to make a few further remarks as to how the adjustment came about here. We have the number of days, what a searching time, David lying on the earth, eating nothing, the child sick, sick by the divine stroke; what a scene for heaven, day after day, the child sick, and sickening, sickening, he dies -- seven days -- the adjustment requires that:
{178}
it must be perfect spiritually. Adjustment cannot be other than perfect spiritually: spiritual adjustment means not only correction, not only self-judgment, but that I am to go on positively according to my best days. That is what is in mind, yea, with David better days than ever before. So he lies on the earth and his servants are watching him. We may thank God for such watchers, as we need adjustment. They do not understand him, for the more spiritual I am the less I am understood; the spiritual discerns all things, but he is never discerned fully. They do not understand him; many a man has to suffer in this way, he is too spiritual even in his failures to be understood. Such is the life of a spiritual man, the experience of a spiritual man that is beyond understanding. His servants do not understand him: he lay on the earth while the child was alive, he arose and anointed himself and went and worshipped when the child died; who can understand a man like that? The secret is, beloved, he is a spiritual man and that is what God knew about him; God is bringing out wonderful things in his servant. He knew what was there, and it is all coming out now. Then David hears them whispering, he understands them; many of us do not think a spiritual man understands us; he does, a spiritual man understands your whispering, and there will be no want of that in these circumstances. Why not speak out? They were whispering; they did not understand David, but he understood them, and he understood that the child was dead. It was as much as to say in their whispering, he is not spiritual; they did not understand him, he will be worse than he was before; that is not spirituality. A spiritual man discerns the judgment of God, and when that is executed he knows that God will go on, that God is not going to stop in this matter. He goes on, and the spiritual man says I will go on too, the matter is settled. What a great
{179}
triumph that is, the matter is settled in David's mind, and he arose and washed himself and changed his garments and entered in and worshipped God. He is a leader in the service of God and he is now entering on his best days, pursuing his old line, the best days he had; he is entering on them, serving God. Well, they say, explain it. Well, it is just this, that the judgment of God has exhausted itself, it is all over, and I am going to begin over again; I began with God; He would have me to go on as before. God has judged the thing and I have judged it, and I am another man now, I mean I am what I used to be. He changed his clothes and washed himself and worshipped God. It is the old David, as I may say, speaking simply, the kind of David that was known spiritually before; he has now come up again, the child is dead, that is all finished. But a Solomon is in view; the horizon is lit up in the next verse with a Solomon. What glorious prospects David has now! A worshipper, he is adjusted, and, dear brethren, that is what is in mind today; God is looking for worshippers, men too, that will carry on the service; and of course I need not tell you the later history of David, how he inaugurated the service of God.
Now I go on to Peter. He is the outstanding man of the New Testament to support what I have been saying. You will observe that this is a prolonged matter, although Peter was adjustable from the outset, as the Lord looked on him. Luke tells us that the Lord looked on Peter as the cock crew, and Peter went out and wept bitterly; he did not go out to worship like David, but still the process is similar; he wept bitterly, he was as it were going through the thing with God. How long he wept I cannot say; he wept bitterly and he went out, it was all real. But three days afterwards the Lord Jesus appeared to him, what a meeting that was! He appeared unto Simon. It does not say He rebuked him because the
{180}
second time it was grace, it was indeed in principle the inauguration of this wonderful day in which we are, the day of grace; it was the Lord saying, 'This is the order of this wonderful day, this acceptable year of the Lord', and indeed the brethren were talking about it. It says, "The Lord ... has appeared to Simon" @Luke 24:34; they were talking about it in the assembly as gathered together, but then the process was somewhat longer, but if it need be long let the result be perfect, dear brethren. That is what comes out in Peter, the result is perfect. He had professed to love the Lord Jesus, but the Lord told him he would do all this; he professed to love Christ more than all, "I will lay down my life for thee", but the Lord says, "Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice", @John 13:37,38 and it was so, but there were two things: he said he loved the Lord more than any, and he said he would lay down his life for Him. He could not say anything greater, if it were really true, than that he loved the Lord Jesus, for that is what he implied; the Lord's remark to him intimates that he thought his love exceeded all others, and these two things must go together in the adjustment; the Lord took him at his word. I verily believe, dear brethren, that if any resolution is taken, however feebly, before the Lord, He will bring you to it; He may allow a breakdown, but He will bring you to it, and that is the adjustment. He would say, That is the very best thing you ever said, and I will hold you to it, circumstances will bring you to it. Such is our Lord and Master, He works on this line, He works according to His own mind but He loves to work from ours too; as our minds accord with His He puts it on our minds and credits us with it and says, I will bring you to it. So that I verily believe it is a good thing to make resolutions; certain are said to have addicted themselves to the ministry; in fact if you make a vow it says, see that you pay it, as if
{181}
God is pleased with a vow. I am not making you legal, but God loves people to make resolutions in His presence, and He says, I will see to you and bring you to it, and will be with you till you come to it. David had to go through much sorrow, and who could depict what an experience Peter had in those awful days? He went out and wept bitterly, the three days in which the Lord lay in the tomb, and yet wonderful to say the Lord came into the midst. He did not say a word to him personally as far as we know. In @John 20 there was not a single complaint; there was nothing to complain of for that is the abstract thought, if you understand me, though Peter's real complete recovery was still future. May not one suppose that there might have been a gesture to Peter even then in the company, suggesting that things were not altogether right yet. The Lord was standing, He was ready to serve Peter. Even great as @John 20:19 is, Peter's incomplete recovery was there, incomplete adjustment was there. Did the Lord not know it? He was there to serve, He is standing. "If I wash thee not" @John 13:8, the Lord had said to him, and he needed it again. The Lord says, I am ready; He is ready now for anyone here, always ready.
Peter and six other brothers went off on a fishing expedition, without Jesus, as if nothing had happened. This is the third time the Lord appeared to His disciples; the first is in chapter 20:19, the second later in that chapter, and the third is in chapter 21. The third *manifestation;* it is not simply an appearing, it is a manifestation, a word that John selects peculiarly, so after they had dined the Lord raises the question of love; that is really what He means. He knew what was there, and the third time He says, "Lovest thou me?". Peter is grieved now, but the matter is urgent, the Lord is finishing the work; there is nothing more interesting than a finished
{182}
work. So Peter says to the Lord, "Lord, thou knowest all things", and He did, of course, divinely; but Peter says, You know that I have affection for Thee. One has often called attention to the change of words here, it is very instructive for all of us. The last word 'knowest', that Peter uses, is an objective 'know'. Peter is now saying to the Lord, 'You have finished the matter, You can see that in me *externally* there is some evidence that I love You', and it was so, the Lord had brought that about, whether it was in a gesture of Peter's or a look, or whatever it was, he could say truthfully to the Lord, 'You can see in me that I love You'; the Lord knew that. I would like to be able to say, 'Lord, You can see in me that I love You'. The Lord liked that, He liked the change of word that Peter made; that he should select another word for 'know', referring to what is positive, to what the Lord could see in him visibly; he says, 'You can see by that how I love You'. The Lord says that will do, that is enough, the matter is finished. I am to demonstrate not that I *have* loved the Lord, but that I now love Him, and others can see it too; the matter is finished, so the Lord now says to Peter, there is one difficulty, it is a question of your youth, youthful energy. I have sympathy with young people, because youthfulness in itself is an exposure to the devil, and the more we understand it the more we shall set our faces against it; the more I see the danger the more safe I am if I set my face against it: The Lord says, "When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest; but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee wither thou wouldest not". That is the finish. Peter is entirely resigned to the will of God, and he is laying down his life for Jesus, as he previously wished to do.
{183}
That is all, dear brethren: you can see that in each of these three cases the matter is finished, and that is what the Lord is aiming at, so that we may go on according to our best days in the service of God, Godward and manward.
{184}
QUALITIES NECESSARY FOR PRIESTHOOD
@Exodus 18:10 - 12; @Exodus 24:5; @Exodus 28:1 - 4,40 - 43
J.T. What is in mind is to seek under the Lord to reach an understanding of priesthood so far as we can. The service of God as far as we are concerned necessarily calls for priesthood in the sense in which it appears in chapter 28. Earlier it is seen in these other scriptures; first in Jethro, and then in the youths of Israel in chapter 24. The appearance of the subject in the book is very orderly, for the idea of service begins in chapter 3, where it is stated it should be in a certain place, namely, the mountain, and then Israel is viewed as a son in view of service.
Moses asserted to Pharaoh several times that there should be cattle suitable for offerings to Jehovah. What is striking is that Jethro comes into it according to the verses read as showing us that quality suitable for priesthood must underlie the official exercise of it: that is, before the thing is owned officially it must be there in quality. Jethro represents the formative side -- he is growing in his soul, having heard from Moses what God had done for Israel -- and he goes into it joyously (@Exodus 18:9) and in verse 10 he blesses Jehovah. Following that he confesses his knowledge, "I know that Jehovah is greater than all gods; for in the thing in which they acted haughtily he was above them". He is gathering up the true knowledge of God, and the true knowledge of God is essential to the service of God as priests. He took a burnt-offering and sacrifices for God; Aaron comes and all the elders to eat bread in the presence of God. That is evidently a good meeting; no official priest but nevertheless priestly service.
{185}
The service of God is to be marked by freshness; these youths of the children of Israel are there under the direction of the mediator. This element runs through from this point; priesthood is subservient to mediatorship. That is, authority in Christ is present in regard to the exercise of priesthood, which leads us to chapter 28, where we have the formal requirements of God, "That he may serve me as priest". "And thou shalt take thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him, from among the children of Israel, that he may serve me as priest".
In chapter 19 Jehovah says, "Then shall ye be my own possession out of all the peoples -- for all the earth is mine -- and ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation". @Exodus 19:5,6. That is the thought applying to all, but chapter 28 contemplates selection, the idea is narrowed down to a family, and they, in particular, are to serve Jehovah as priests. Again in verse 4 we get "That he may serve me as priest", and in the end of the chapter "That they may serve me as priests" (verse 41).
Ques. What is the difference between a "kingdom of priests" and a family?
J.T. I think it is a question of quality. It is a principle with God that when a matter is introduced it becomes more and more refined; it is the principle of refinement, that which is more excellent, showing that Israel will have a priestly place by and by on earth, but we have it in a more refined and exalted way. We belong to a priestly family.
E.L.M. Is it that the point of refinement should be reached that should immediately concern us?
J.T. We ought to have it before us; the heavenly calling requires this thought of refinement and selection.
J.H.T. When you speak of selection in chapter 28 have you in mind Aaron's previous history in chapter 4
{186}
where he kissed his brother and he and Moses brought the people to the point of worship?
J.T. He is in the background from the beginning. In speaking to Moses Jehovah had in His mind a one-man matter -- and of course it is in the antitype, Christ is Apostle and High Priest -- so in speaking to Moses the emphasis is that the whole matter is to be in his hands. Aaron meeting Moses suggests the truth of 'brethren', but primarily God had one Man in mind in the whole matter; He had Christ in mind. It was so ordered that mediatorship is in one man's hand and priesthood is in another. In teaching, no doubt, it is good that it is so. We learn in part and we can see the matter more clearly in that way; Aaron is clearly in the background from the beginning.
J.McK. In @Romans 15, where the apostle speaks of the saints glorifying the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, would that be priesthood appearing?
J.T. Informally, not yet formally. Romans runs parallel with this; we have priesthood without naming it.
W.L. This matter of priestly service becomes all a question of clothing, does it not?
J.T. Clothing represents qualities, the great divine thoughts touching the office. In Exodus young brothers come into it. We are taken up for service and reminded that we are sons, and God asserts there are certain qualities needed in the matter. Every christian is a priest but God reminds us He looks for certain qualities. If I give out a hymn my spirit moves me to do it, but even a favourite hymn must be with the understanding; my intelligence must indicate it is suitable or I do not use it. Likewise in everything in the assembly, intelligence is the thought. I am to sing with the intelligence and pray with the intelligence.
{187}
J.H.T. I wondered if intelligence appeared in the youths in chapter 24; when Moses sent them, *they* offered sacrifices without being specifically commanded.
J.T. It alludes to the progress already made in the book. Jethro is the formation that comes into the soul; he is a foreigner but he is coming into the truth and going on in it. The youngest brother is able to officiate with the most experienced brother.
E.L.M. Would the youths be an indication of progress -- a wider thought, there are more of them?
J.T. In each case the service fits. It is indeed great; I do not jar anyone in this service, I do not offend the ear of the assembly, or, above all, the ear of God, for He is listening. Divine Persons are attentive. It is the spiritual element that is to lead us, so that what the youths had here seems to be in advance of Jethro. What he did he did of himself, meaning all young believers growing by the true knowledge of God come into fellowship and take part.
Aaron came to eat bread with Moses¬ father-in-law. The next occasion is under authority; he *sent* the youths of the children of Israel and they offered burnt offerings and sacrifices of peace offering of bullocks to Jehovah. This connects with the Lord's supper; we are under the Lord's authority, but anyone with liberty in his soul in the assembly as under authority may take part, but the point is what is done is suitable.
F.W. Would Jethro indicate formation in the every-day life? We were noticing yesterday how frequently he is stated to be the father-in-law.
J.T. His relation to Moses is expressed ten or twelve times as "in-law". In his case it was extended back a good while, but as he heard things (and, indeed, he is hearing things from Moses), he is affected, and then he has the wife with him and sons -- they would be an abstract thought in relation to
{188}
the assembly in a person of this stature. The gospel suggests the thought to us, the basis of offering is in the gospel in Romans. The idea of the wife is with Jethro; she is not brought into the feast. She is recognised, but the meeting is really made up of Jethro, who has the leading part, and Aaron and all the elders of Israel. It is in the presence of God; it is a meeting characterised by the peace-offering. It is not so far that Jehovah has part in the thing, but it is in keeping with the presence of God.
F.W. You were suggesting that it is relative to the Lord's supper, the youths introducing the thought. It is "under the mountain"; it is a different position from "up ... into the mountain".
J.T. They have now committed themselves formally to Jehovah, and so they were in a morally greater position and Moses is moving in sending the youths; it does not seem he says what to do, but they do it under his influence.
G.E.E. Would you say the youths are together in it in relation to the covenant?
J.T. I thought they maintained the freshness of it; that is important in our meetings. There is no one of us that has not been affected by the part young brothers have taken. Progress in the subject is here, in freshness, and under control; it is not a brother doing it of himself. In the assembly we must be always under control; that is what appears here.
S.H. Are the young brought in before the priesthood is established?
J.T. It is not a simply individual impulse; they are under orders; they are under control. We come together in assembly and it is the Lord's matter; it is His authority from the outset.
F.W. Would you indicate what position this sprinkling of blood has in our economy?
J.T. It is 1 Corinthians where we have the blood, "the new covenant in my blood". @1 Corinthians 11:25. We have not got
{189}
the blood in the second letter, it is the spirit of the new covenant there. This chapter corresponds with @1 Corinthians 11, where the blood is part of the Lord's supper.
J.H.T. As to priesthood in Romans you have the quality appearing, "full of goodness" @Romans 15:4, and in Colossians spiritual feelings coming forward and in Ephesians the intelligence: "being enlightened in the eyes of your heart". @Ephesians 1:18.
J.T. That is the order. You are strengthened in chapter 3 by the Father's Spirit. We were saying in Plymouth that what is developed first of all are qualities of service in the living creatures in Revelation. There is the face of a man, a lion, the calf and flying eagle; these are qualities developed livingly in young christians or however old we may be. The elders refer to persons; the qualities are subservient to persons. They know just what to do and wait upon the exercise of quality in the assembly. The elders come in when the living creatures come in.
W.L. Would you say what we are to understand by priestly service?
J.T. Chapter 28 introduces it to us formally. We have already been remarking that certain serve unofficially; that is, they serve in relation to certain qualities, formation in Jethro and freshness in the youths; now we have an advanced point and God is opening a heavenly system. Moses is to be there forty days. He is there to receive all those wonderful divine thoughts: the tabernacle is stated to be a representation of things in the heavens, and Jehovah is showing him the pattern. Priesthood comes in in the midst of all this, as if, in the presence of such great thoughts, we need persons of intelligence. Things must be done rightly. Chapter 28 opens the thing up and it is now in the one family; we are now in the presence of the greatest thoughts. We must
{190}
learn everything from Christ; the saints thus come in and take their part.
W.F. "Consider the apostle and high priest ...". @Hebrews 3:1.
J.T. It is that we might learn priesthood in Christ. Peter says we are priests.
W.B. Would we get the quality of service in Peter: "Sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ"? @1 Peter 2:5.
J.T. That is the thought.
W.F. What is the thought of "by Jesus Christ"? @1 Peter 2:5.
J.T. We offer in relation to *Him*.
W.L. Does priesthood mean offering up spiritual sacrifices?
J.T. Priesthood means that divine requirements are taken care of. I do not think it will go into eternity: it will not be needed, it is too great a position. What God is, the exigencies of divine nature, require this in addition to Sonship. The primary thought is that sons shall serve, but priesthood shows it is provisional to keep in restraint all that would defile in relation to God.
W.L. Is it confined in expression to the Supper?
J.T. It goes right through.
E.G. It would come into prayer.
J.T. *It* affects *all* that attaches to the service of God.
J.H.T. Do you get priests standing for God in Uzziah's day when eighty priests withstood him (@2 Chronicles 26:18)?
J.T. They are maintaining the rights of God.
G.E.E. Would spiritual conditions be seen in @Hebrews 2:11? He is "not ashamed to call them brethren".
J.T. That is the highest point in Hebrews. In the truth viewed as we shall be in heaven as entirely in Christ's present humanity the thought of priesthood is not necessary. It does not say He is 'not
{191}
ashamed to call us priests', but *brethren;* He sings Himself in the midst of the assembly. We are partakers of His humanity there, His holy nature; we shall share that eternally. Priesthood is not there.
Ques. Has the Lord anything less to offer now than the prayers and praises of His people?
J.T. He is there Himself.
W.F. "By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise continually to God". @Hebrews 13:15.
J.T. It is more that *we* offer, not that He offers us. It is a continual service carried on, seen in its most exalted way in the assembly.
E.T.S. Could we do without priesthood in our worship?
J.T. It is a question of whether we are free of our flesh and blood condition; it is doubtful if any one of us can say we are; there is nothing else suggested than serving as priest here.
Ques. If there is to be response and God is to have things presented fully and acceptably, can you not see the necessity for conditions?
J.T. It is all in view of conditions. When we reach the types, the temple and the service there, are a figure of eternal things. We reach a point there where priests cannot minister. That does not mean the saints are shut out, but we have got on to the eternal state of things; the metals of the temple denote what the saints are, the official side is just dropped.
E.L.M. Would that suggest three offices of priesthood -- the moral qualifications of Jethro, the youths and more official side in chapter 28, and touching what is eternal that you have alluded to?
J.T. That is good. The priests could not serve, and yet the glory was there and affections of God were satisfying themselves; Christ remains Son before the Father -- priesthood is in abeyance.
{192}
Ques. I noticed a remark in your prayer in connection with Peter's word, "the holy one of God", @John 6:69 and I wondered if that bore upon priesthood.
J.T. It does, intimately. John's gospel contemplates persons affected by the presence and service of Christ. John the baptist sees Him sacrificially, as the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world; he is able to name that Person; the woman at the well sees Him in another way, as He takes her on in the service. She is to be a vessel in the great administrative work He has taken on. "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand" @John 3:35, and then in chapter 4 the woman is affected by the Lord in an administrative capacity. She is brought into the thing as her soul is enlightened as to Him. She leaves her waterpot and goes into the city, meaning she understands she is part of the great administrative system. Peter comes in next, "Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast words of life eternal; and we have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God", @John 6:68,69. That is the way He carries on the service of God. There is the sacrificial side and the administrative side and priestly side. Peter sees the priesthood at Jerusalem set aside.
J.H.T. Was it in your mind to say a few words as to verse 4?
J.T. There is no time. What is in mind is more general, this expression particularly "That he may serve me as priest", not as son. It is sons that serve, only priesthood is needed because of conditions and that raises the whole question of what state we are in. The garments are qualities in which priesthood is exercised; the whole chapter undertakes for the necessity for suitable conditions.
E.G. Would you say a word about the plural thought, 'sons'?
{193}
J.T. The linen garments are brought in particularly with them, showing a balance to the subject of beauty. The chief idea is Christ in His garments of glory and beauty; in the sons it is in a lesser way but with the linen. It keeps us balanced.
Ques. Do the garments represent various states of soul qualifying for priesthood?
J.T. "And these are the garments which they shall make: a breastplate, and an ephod, and a cloak, and a checkered vest, a turban, and a girdle: and they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, and his sons, that he may serve me as priest". The breastplate is remarkable as coming first; that is, so to say, that which includes all the saints in the affections of Christ. He has all the saints upon His heart; Aaron never went in without this. It is as if God would say, You must have all the saints. In a lesser way in each of Aaron's sons there is what would take character from the breastplate. You must love the saints.
Ques. Do the clothes indicate the qualities or features of mind underneath the clothes?
J.T. You must have the qualities; the clothes are the external evidence of the state we are in.
That brings in another matter; namely, the Hebrew bondman as a figure of Christ. He loves master, wife and children; that is, love is in widest evidence: ascending, horizontal, so to speak, and descending love is there. He undertakes to remain in that attitude for ever; that is the full limit of love. In chapter 28 it is the same Person in type only in glorious garments indicating that love underneath was there.
{194}
GOD HONOURING HIS SON
@Matthew 22:1 - 14; @Matthew 25:1 - 13; @Revelation 22:16,17
J.T. What is in mind is to show that the idea of the bride and Bridegroom runs actively through the dispensation from the beginning to the end, and that it particularly enters into the service of God as presently constituted. Matthew, as these passages show, brings it in perhaps more than the other evangelists, although the idea is in all of them. It may be helpful to remark that, in the types, the thought is connected with God: the marital thought has its origin with God. God thought of it in regard of Christ and the assembly: Abraham thought of it in regard of Isaac: Isaac thought of it in regard of Jacob: that is, the fatherly or parental feature of the truth enters into it. So that as in assembly service, that part of it that is referring to the Lord includes that God would make much of Christ and have Him honoured, as He says Himself, "That all may honour the Son, even as they honour the Father" @John 5:23; and that links our first scripture with God making a marriage for His Son in type and figure, and the thought is to make it the most felicitous occasion possible; joyousness spiritually belongs to such an occasion, and this is to be reflected throughout the dispensation. Chapter 25 presents the marital thought from the side of affection in the virgins to show how it had lapsed and become revived. So at the end of Revelation we have both bride and Bridegroom: the bride is not in view in the gospels formally, but she is in Revelation and speaks with the Spirit.
W.W. Is it that Matthew brings in this sort of ministry more than the other writers on account of his being an assembly gospel?
J.T. Well, I had that in mind. The assembly is what I suppose we might call the prime thought in
{195}
relation to Christ in the gospel of Matthew, and these marital parables -- as we may call them -- come in after the assembly is spoken of formally; first of all, Christ's assembly, viewed thus as the assembly in administrative function, so that it is obvious the bearing of these parables must be toward the assembly. We have similes of the kingdom of God before chapter 16 and then, after chapter 16, we have a series of similes which contemplate the existence of the assembly -- these parables of the kingdom of the heavens contemplate the existence of the assembly; in fact historically the joy contemplated in the wedding feast, as it is called, necessitates the assembly. There was no Jewish thing capable of such a feast as this, for it is a question, not of the wedding, but of the wedding *feast;* it is real satisfaction that is in mind. God would have us to understand that it is to honour His Son, that He does it for His Son; it is a most joyous time, and the place for it suggests the assembly; conditions for it are not found elsewhere any more than they are for the house in @Luke 15, which is a parallel thought and contemplates the assembly.
W.C. Would wisdom's house in @Proverbs 9, where similar language is used, confirm what you are saying as to the assembly preceding the feast?
J.T. I think that is good. "Wisdom hath builded her house" @Proverbs 9:1 -- there is everything there that is needed for such an occasion. Where could you find conditions suitable for such a joyous occasion when you consider who it is -- it is *God* preparing for His Son -- save in the assembly?
Ques. The king made a wedding feast for his son; would that speak of the movements of God in time?
J.T. It does. It took on a supremely joyous character and it could only do so because there were conditions.
{196}
J.S. Would it be right to say that the kingdom of the heavens being made like to ten virgins would suggest the way God has come in in latter days and wrought definitely?
J.T. Well, historically, chapter 25 dates back to the beginning, but it would not go as far back as chapter 22, because the foolish virgins, that is, professors of christianity, are contemplated in chapter 25 God, as it were, brought this about; He would give mere professors, as we say, and they were only that, full credit for the profession they made. Their own negligence is to be credited for their great disaster, not that the oil was not available, but that they were negligent about it.
W.W. What is the significance of its being a question of the lack of the garment in chapter 22, but the lack of the oil in chapter 25?
J.T. There is only one man lacking the garment in chapter 22. It says, "The king, having gone in to see the guests, beheld there a man not clothed with a wedding garment". It is an exception, it was a very exceptional case. But in chapter 25 half of them are foolish, so that this chapter evidently alludes to a morally later period when the profession had taken on, you might say, unreality; and yet they are accredited with being virgins. Now the wedding garment would correspond, I suppose, with the wise virgins, with the oil, but I think it is a word for us as to our part in the assembly, whether we understand what a wedding garment means, how serious it is to be without one!
J.S. Would the thought of the wedding garment refer to an individual, as in @Romans 7, where his body is to be to another?
J.T. Yes, it is not simply that you belong to the bride, but you know what an occasion it is. We have different occasions; an occasion like this, for instance, requires a certain garment; it requires that
{197}
I should be very alert and ready to participate in it as obligated to make it profitable. If it be a meeting for prayer, there is another garment needed, more priestly: if it be an assembly occasion, then all are to be intelligent persons, not members of a congregation simply; all are to be intelligent persons knowing what is on hand and knowing what to do. If it develops into an occasion, as it ought to, of real pleasure, and there is One present who has the status of the Bridegroom, He is to radiate over the whole affair. If it be God in the occasion honouring His Son, He is to have to say to what is there, and He discerns whether I am in accord with this great matter; He is honouring His Son and I have to understand that part of the matter. There may be other features, for @Luke 14 would mean that the man made a great supper, which would be the celebration of something for himself; it would be God Himself; and so chapter 15 would be God Himself, "It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad" @Luke 15:32 -- everybody. But here it is a question of God honouring His Son and of whether I have this wedding garment; it is a marital affair and it must have its reflection in the assembly service. It is the greatest affair really as bringing personality in, how a person is at his best as the bridegroom; that is how the Lord Jesus shines upon us as He takes account of us as the bride.
Ques. In Matthew the bride is not specifically mentioned, is she? Would you say it comes in on the line of the Lord saying in @Jeremiah 2:2, "I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals", and then again in @Hosea 2:14, "I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness", as He set out in Exodus to do; they were to hold a feast to Jehovah in the wilderness? The bride is absent in Matthew, but it is the guests invited that are in
{198}
prominence; is your suggestion that the assembly meets the idea of the guests invited?
J.T. Well, the bride is not formally mentioned, but a wedding feast must comprise her; but the point is that there is a person with ample means to make such an occasion a great one on account of his son; that is the point, it is what he is doing on account of his son -- not on account of the bride, but on account of the son. And it is not exactly the wedding but the feast; that is, all are to have part in it, but it is a wedding affair and therefore is to carry with it the best possible features in the personnel.
J.S. Would it involve more place being found for the passages of love in the Canticles?
J.T. Well, the Song of Songs is the book in the Old Testament for the mutual exchange of feeling and affection between Christ and the assembly, or between Christ and Israel, as the earthly bride.
Ques. Would all this be in happy contrast to the previous chapter? Would this come in on the line of the assembly, the grace of Christ and joyousness in the place the Father has given Him?
J.T. Well, it would be that in the sense that we are in accord with the occasion, not so much our response to Christ's affection as that we see that God is honouring Him, that there is a part in the service in which God honours Him, as there is, of course, a part in which He honours God. He makes much of the Father in John, as we know, but in this parable the point is that the Father makes much of the Son, and those who are guests, ourselves together, are clothed with what is suitable to that, that it is no less a matter than a marriage, it is a wedding feast, no less than that, and the question is whether I am equal to it; that is what we should get hold of, I believe, whether I am equal to that personally, for the King came in. We say, it is the Lord in the beginning of assembly service, and it is, it is
{199}
a question of the Lord, but then there is a point in which God has to say to it too, not for His own sake, but for the sake of Christ. He is concerned about that, for there must be the honour of the Son in every relation as the Father's honour. So that it seems as if this particular parable would come in as making room for God to look around to see the guests. I have to say to God in all this; I have to say to Christ too from another point of view, for it is the Lord's supper; but then there is a linking on between the Lord's supper and what attaches to the Father, and it seems the Father and the Son meet, the One honouring the Other; that is, both must be honoured, the One will honour the Other.
W.C.G. Would @Psalm 19 apply to honouring the Son? It says, "A tabernacle for the sun, which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race". @Psalm 19:4,5.
J.T. It is a wonderful figure really, but it is to bring out, I think, what we are saying, what the Bridegroom is. What a radiance, what heat, what joy, the sun brings as it rises. It is a remarkable figure as showing the strength of affection in Christ.
W.C.G. What is the idea of the tabernacle for the sun?
J.T. As you say, I suppose it is a figure of Christ, that He has what belongs to Him in a private way. Who can give an account of the sun? Carrying the thought to Christ, it means He has His private relations, coming out of His chamber; there are the secrecies, the secrets connected with Christ's inscrutable relations; but when He comes out in His light, one feature is the effect on the creation. That is how it is in the assembly: the sun, as denoting Christ's affection and relations comes out and beams on us; not simply that He comes, but that He *beams* upon us because of whence He comes, and the relation He is in. John the baptist rejoiced at His voice,
{200}
which is that of the Bridegroom. The Lord as here in His ministry had that voice, the voice of the Bridegroom; in all His services there was the Bridegroom's voice. All did not understand that, but there it was; what was deep down in His heart in all He was doing there was that joyous thought. John the baptist had discernment enough to see that that was the voice, not simply of a great Preacher and Friend and Teacher, even God Himself, but that He was a Bridegroom -- the peculiar touch of that relation.
Ques. Would this suitability of clothing be seen in @Psalm 45:14? "She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of embroidery".
J.T. That is right. Then she is all glorious inside. We have first of all the tribute to the king there, "I say what I have composed touching the king. My tongue is the pen of a ready writer". @Psalm 45:1. After that you have the queen on his right -- that is a great general abstract thought -- in gold of Ophir; that which is discerned as the full thought; she is a personage of that kind, she is the queen: But when you come down to details in, "Hearken; daughter, and see, and incline thine ear; and forget thine own people and thy father's house: And the king will desire thy beauty; for he is thy Lord, and worship thou him" @Psalm 45:10,11, the individual christian comes into the great abstract thought, I think, in that way. And then she is inside in the royal apartments, she comes in raiment of embroidery; she is inside the royal apartments suitably attired, all glorious inside there, suitable to the position.
Ques. Would the type of Mordecai come in, the man whom the king delighted to honour? Would that correspond with your thought of the king making a marriage feast for his son? Mordecai was the outstanding man at the moment, as the son is here.
J.T. That is a good figure, I think. It is the man he delights to honour, but Mordecai was honoured
{201}
as the one who had served the king, saved his life; but here it is the case of a man honouring his son, it brings Christ in in a beautiful way and He is honoured by a wedding feast made for Him by His Father, the king being His Father.
Rem. So we want God's thoughts of His Son.
J.T. That is right. He could honour Him in other ways, of course. Mordecai is a type of Christ as He whom God delights to honour; there it was that he went round the city. God has honoured Christ in a variety of ways: He has greatly exalted Him, set Him down at His own right hand far above all principalities and powers and every name that is named, not only in this world but in that which is to come. And in various other ways God honours Him, but this is a peculiar thing into which affection enters, that He is honouring Him by a wedding feast.
Rem. Satisfying the heart of Christ as Man with the affections of the assembly.
J.T. Yes, and satisfying Him with such guests; it is to bring out too that God's grace enters into it, God's wonderful patience with the Jews enters into it, as if God would say, 'This is the very best thing I can devise and. I want you to be there' -- that is what He says to the Jews. John the baptist heard His voice; the Jews ought to have heard it, but they did not. And He says now there is an invitation to ourselves, and the gentiles have come, the wedding feast is furnished with guests, good and evil. The good and evil, of course, is one thought, but the wedding garment covers all that; it alludes to the work of God that fits us for the place.
Ques. Do you suggest that the Spirit of God would make room for all this in His service at the Lord's supper?
J.T. That is what I think we ought to get to. It is right to have the general thought, for God includes
{202}
grace in what He has in mind in the parable, He includes the wonderful voice of Christ in His ministry among the Jews, that it was no less than the Bridegroom's voice John the baptist heard. But nevertheless it is a wedding and it runs down to us gentiles, and the solemn fact is that there must be wedding garments; no one can be there without a wedding garment.
Rem. So that all might honour the Son even as they honour the Father.
J.T. Just so, that is how the matter stands that the Father honours the Son and the Son honours the Father.
Ques. What is your thought as to the fact that only the king observes the absence of the wedding garment?
J.T. Well, it is his matter, he is doing it, and it is a solemn thing that God inspects us as we sit down to the Lord's supper; it is something into which honour for Christ enters, and God is concerned about that. It is God's assembly and He is concerned as to all that happens in it, although the earlier part of it refers to the Lord. It is *God's* matter.
W.C. So does the scrutiny of the King work out at the end?
J.T. Well, it is most solemn; it is not only discipline, but it is eternal punishment. The passage shows we are dealing with eternal things in every sense. How serious our position is; there is nothing optional at all in assembly service; we are having to do with God, whether in the beginning or middle or end of the service: the assembly is God's matter and His eye is upon it in the most scrutinising way. It is true discipline is mentioned in @1 Corinthians 11, that we are not to be judged with the world, but then, we *may* be judged with the world and it is a most solemn thing. We have to do with God.
{203}
Ques. In the service of the assembly would the affections of the bride be given effect to, or is it that the Bridegroom is held in her affections?
J.T. It is more the Bridegroom we are dealing with now. God is making a marriage feast for His Son and He is concerned that there should be nothing out of keeping with Him; so in our whole service we are having to do with God.
W.W. Does that raise the question as to how we come together as clothed in features, so that God can appreciate our presence as those that are together?
J.T. Certainly. You do not want to mar the occasion. There are many who sit down to the Lord's supper and go right through the service just as members of a congregation; God has no pleasure in that; He wants the garment.
Ques. Would the garment link with the thought, "With joy and gladness shall they be brought"? @Psalm 45:15.
J.T. Quite so, it is a most felicitous state of things, most delightful, it is the best sort of thing, as it were, that God could devise to present in the gospel -- nothing less than that. So there is the voice of the Bridegroom in His teaching; there is a wedding in prospect and the idea is you should come into it. So it is today, the gentiles are brought into it, the wedding is furnished with guests, but there is this scrutiny which goes on, and if is really brought into every service: Am I there suitably, or in a restless way with no interest, merely as a member of a congregation?
Rem. You would stress the personality of the guests.
J.T. Certainly; each is to be intelligent as to the position, what he has been invited to. These functions, as they are called in the world, have a suitable dress for each one, and society people know it and they know what to wear. Why should not we, when
{204}
we come to divine things, the greatest possible things, know what to wear, know the suitable attire, and how to take account of the position?
Ques. That is extremely important; it is the assembly of the living God. We have been lax in our appreciation of that.
J.T. I think that is good; it is *God's* assembly and we are to behave ourselves in it, "that thou mayest know how one ought to conduct oneself in God's house, which is the assembly of the living God". @1 Timothy 3:15.
N.K.M. Would what Peter says to Simon Magus be like the man who had not on the wedding garment? He says, "Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God", @Acts 8:21.
J.T. A very solemn illustration of what we are speaking of. He had no wedding garment at all; it was a question of his attitude of mind, what his thoughts were, that the Holy Spirit could be bought with money. Think of that, of a man who could say that! So the apostle exposes him, and hence the scrutiny with which we are regarded: He came in to *see* the guests; there is this infinite scrutiny as to what is going on in my soul as sitting there.
Rem. "Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat". @1 Corinthians 11:28.
J.T. Quite so, "So let him eat"; it really means we are to judge ourselves, disallow all that is unsuitable to the position.
F.S.M. Would the idea of the chaste virgin enter into the thought of the wedding garment? Paul says, "I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ", @2 Corinthians 11:2.
J.T. I think it is parallel; that really belongs, as I am sure you have in mind, to chapter 25, but chapters 22 and 25 run parallel. The man without
{205}
the wedding garment is in keeping with those who have no oil; he had not got the Holy Spirit, in other words.
We may now go on to chapter 25, and the apostle tells the Corinthians in the second letter, not in the first, that he had espoused them to one husband; that was in his mind just as in the Lord's mind. The apostle was conveying to them that there was a Bridegroom; he refers to the earlier ministry that he had espoused them to one husband that he might present them as a chaste virgin; that was in his mind, but then the facts showed that the state was not there, that there were rather the characteristics of the foolish virgins among the Corinthians. So that is what we might look at, these ten virgins were professedly believers in early times when defection began to be prevalent; God regards all as virgins, but in a most ironical way shows some are lost sinners shut out forever from the presence of God. So it is all very solemn as to the scrutinising character of this marital matter, how God is concerned about it; so that chastity is a point to be raised now. We may profess to be part of the assembly as espoused, but then what about our affections? Is He supreme in them?
Ques. Would Rebecca illustrate the thought? She is said to be a maiden "very fair in countenance; a virgin, and no man had known her". @Genesis 24:16.
J.T. Quite so, she is taken up to represent the thought underlying the assembly; she represents the thought in youthfulness. Abigail is corresponding in type, a person who had been to another, but whose husband is dead; she is an experienced woman, and she is introduced to us as a woman of "good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance". @1 Samuel 25:3. It is not said of Rebecca that she had a good understanding, but she was very comely in all she did, ready to serve even the camels; but Abigail is a woman who
{206}
comes in and stands in the breach in a great crisis, and she saved the position and becomes David's wife after her husband is dead. There is not the idea of virginity with her, but experience. That is to say, the saints viewed in the Acts as having been brought in in relation to Israel and all the affections of the saints would be in that connection; they were to be to Another; but, under Paul, that was all given up and Abigail represents the saints viewed as turning their backs on judaism altogether and taking up a position in relation to Christ entirely.
W.C.G. The description of Abigail is very similar to that of David.
J.T. She corresponds -- that is very striking. She had been a wife already, so it is no question now of a chaste virgin, but of good understanding, that we know what to do.
Ques. Is that why Abigail is so often referred to, after she became David's wife as "the wife of Nabal the Carmelite"? @1 Samuel 30:5, @2 Samuel 2:2, @2 Samuel 3:3.
J.T. Yes, "if the husband should die, she is free from the law, so as not to be an adulteress, though she be to another man", @Romans 7:3 because the law has settled that matter. Nabal died -- God saw to that -- so Abigail is released to be for David, as in Romans we are to "be to another, who has been raised up from among the dead". @Romans 7:4.
Ques. You have in mind the way we arrive at that experimentally?
J.T. Exactly.
Rem. And her affection would be shown by her willingness to wash the feet of the servants of her lord.
J.T. Just so. In the parable of the virgins they all slumbered and slept. God is accrediting them all with the virgin status, but five of them are at the outset classified as foolish virgins, not sinners -- for that is not the point; they are foolish because they
{207}
do not avail themselves of what was obviously necessary. It was obviously necessary that if they had torches, which are oil lamps, they needed oil, otherwise of what use were the vessels? So it was obvious they should have looked after that part. It shows the folly of people who are not prepared for what they profess to have in mind, for they professed to be going forth to meet the Bridegroom, yet here is something that is absolutely necessary, and they have neglected it.
Ques. Was the thought of the cry to show that the truth as to the Bridegroom had been neglected or overlooked?
J.T. I think the truth of the Spirit had been overlooked; if we have not the Spirit, we have nothing, however much we may profess -- one is just shut out as a lost sinner.
Ques. Would Achsah be an outstanding example of that? She had a south land, but we will never get on without the Spirit.
J.T. Just so.
Ques. Would what is said to the church in Sardis, "Thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead", @Revelation 3:1 fit in?
J.T. I think it does; the one who has not the Spirit does not live; the one who has does live characteristically.
Ques. Are you making a particular application in regard to this matter, not only a general one; not only the virgins viewed as covering the whole profession, but any one of us who may be foolish?
J.T. That is what one would like to do. We are so neglectful and careless, regarding things as optional, as if we had no responsibility in the matter, and here are divine eyes looking into our hearts as to what may be going on there -- the King came in to see the guests. And now the whole position is exposed; these people have not oil, they have not got
{208}
the Spirit, and they are shut out. I want to have a suitable attitude of mind. The Scriptures abound with references to this, and they are intended to impress me, and, if I am impressed, my impressions will come out in the assembly. Those impressions are wealth and they become active as we sit together in assembly.
Ques. Is it that without the oil we are not equal to the movements of the Bridegroom?
J.T. I think that is just what it is. If one has not the oil in chapter 25 the Lord comes in and I am not ready for Him.
Ques. There was oil in the lamps of the wise virgins and there were vessels that accompanied the lamps; would you say they suggest reserves?
J.T. Well, the wise virgins were fully furnished. There is no middle ground at all: it is either the wise or the foolish; and the foolish virgins are shut out, and shut out because of their own negligence. There is much negligence and sluggishness in our assembly meetings.
Rem. So that the Lord would honour us with a touch of His presence and that brings all to light.
J.T. It does. It is the Bridegroom's movements that expose everything. It is the King in chapter 22; but it is the Lord's movements that bring to light where we are in chapter 25. Then in Revelation the bride is there and she is in full accord with the Spirit. It is a very fine passage in that sense, what we reach at the present time.
Ques. Do we see in Simeon one who could fittingly take part in the service as giving place to the Holy Spirit?
J.T. That is a good illustration, alluding to @Luke 2. The Child is brought in and he is ready for Him; he takes Him in his arms and knows what to say. He came by the Spirit into the temple; he is a spiritual
{209}
man; in truth he is a real priest ready for anything of the kind. He knows what to do in the temple.
Ques. Does chapter 25 show how God honours the Spirit, and chapter 22 how God honours the Son, and the wise virgins, in principle, honour the Spirit and provide themselves with the oil?
J.T. Quite so, they are really in accord with the truth of the dispensation. Profession is of no value whatever; it is worse than nothing unless I have the Holy Spirit. We are dependent on the Spirit, and that is what marks the wise virgins; they value the Spirit; they have Him in readiness, as it were.
Ques. What were you going to say as to Revelation?
J.T. Only what has been said: it is a signal tribute to the work of God in the last days, that is, in our times, and we want to be in it, that the bride has come into distinctive evidence. The Lord announces Himself as "the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star" and she, in unison with the Spirit, says, 'Come'. So it is no longer now only the Bridegroom, but the bride herself, and it is in the midst of a dark gloomy state of things that she discerns His voice, and says, Come. The allusion, I think, is to John's gospel and Matthew's gospel: the root of David would be John's gospel; and the offspring, Matthew's gospel, which covers a good deal of ministry we have had on the Lord's own Person and what He is as Man. The assembly characteristically understands; she has good understanding like Abigail; and, as He announces these things, she is with the Holy Spirit and says, Come.
Ques. Is it striking that this immediately follows the thought of testimony in the assemblies? Is that, so to speak, the local gatherings each contributing to the thought of the bride?
{210}
J.T. That is the thought exactly, I believe. The seven assemblies were local assemblies and represent the idea of them, and the bride represents the one idea.
Ques. I was wondering whether the first two parables have peculiar reference to the way we sit down together locally, and, as the result of that adjustment, we may form part of the great general thought the Lord is securing for Himself now.
J.T. Quite so. The three great servants who had to do with the Service of God were Moses and David and Solomon, and we see how the idea of the spouse appears in each. In Moses she is brought to him by her father at a particular time: in David, we have Abigail, as we have been saying, according to the description given of her: and in Solomon we have her just in relation to a gentile progeny, not giving us more than the idea of such a thing, but it is the spouse of Solomon for whom a house was built, corresponding to the porch of judgment. That corresponds with what we were saying that the marital idea stands out so prominently in relation to the service of God and it must enter into it now in relation to its present setting.
{211}
ADDITION BY THE SAINTS
@Luke 1:38 - 40, 46 - 56; @Luke 24:30 - 36; @Acts 4: 23 - 31
What is in mind is to speak about addition, the thought arising from David's exhortation to Solomon that he should add to what had been already accumulated in view of the building of the house of God; that it was to be an accumulation of wealth not only once for all but added to continuously. And so the history of the kings following upon Solomon, and of the prophets, shows that this principle was maintained: there was continuous addition, and no doubt, as this matter is mentioned in our hearing, the desire arises in each lover of Christ and lover of God that he should, at least, add something to what he has found. Of course, each believer is an addition in himself, but that is God's adding. We are told in the Acts of persons being added, but that is not to their credit; what is to their credit is what they added as having been themselves added by God; so while the divine addition is initial as applied to each of us, the addition by the believer is continuous. And it certainly would be a sorry result of any person being added by God that he should live as having added nothing, that one should just be added by God in His sovereignty and pursue his way spiritually inactively, unproductively, unconstructively, leaving only a heap of wood, hay or stubble to be burnt up. Scripture contemplates this, but no true lover of God can contemplate it with anything but the deepest sorrow if it be his case in any sense. We read in the Acts, as I said, of God adding persons, and then Peter who had to do much instrumentally with these additions, tells us that it is as a newborn babe that anyone grows up to salvation by the pure mental milk of the word, and becomes clear of all adverse elements, not only of
{212}
those that are outwardly adverse to the truth, but of those in himself that would hinder his growth into salvation. It implies that one is clear and has a free hand, and thus he moves to Christ as a living stone. That is more than divine addition, that is self addition, Christ being the living stone to whom he comes: "Yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up", @1 Peter 2:5 that is self addition. I mean in so far as he moves with Christ, the divine operation takes place at once, for he cannot build himself in: he is being built in as a living stone, as a spiritual house, a holy priesthood -- he belongs to that -- to offer up spiritual sacrifices. He has not only himself, but sacrifices; and not only material sacrifices, which are also valuable in their place, but *spiritual ones* and these are what I have in mind. Spiritual sacrifices can be traced from Solomon's day onwards; yea, from @Exodus 16, the great beginning of the service of God in redemption, we have continuous addition, until the Chief Musician arrives who puts everything in its place, so that even our addition, as well as ourselves, comes under divine control and filling, and hence, as passing off the scene under the will of God, one has left something.
Well now, I want to show from Mary in @Luke 1 how this service proceeds; it is in one's being singled out, and every one of us, beloved brethren, has been singled out divinely -- a great and wonderful fact! Mary was separated and qualified for a great purpose; I speak now of her as illustrative, not to set out the great facts of the incarnation, but only to deduce a principle from them. She is taken up on a particular date, the sixth month, and that date has reference to a divine operation in another like her, that is Elizabeth, so that both have a common point of sympathy. Much is said by the angel to Mary which is familiar to us, but it finishes with a date as to Elizabeth, and Mary says, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word".
{213}
The angel had said to her, "With God nothing shall be impossible". @Luke 1:37. There can be no addition spiritually, dear brethren, save in the acceptance of that initial fact; it is what is possible with God. However I may think of myself as an unlikely person to add to the great testimony that has now moved down for centuries, this word settles everything, "With God nothing shall be impossible". Let no one exempt himself therefore in this great matter. God had wrought with Elizabeth and He had now wrought with Mary; they have a common subject of interest, it is the work of God. They are set in relation to each other also on the principle of date, and these respective operations of God have matured in the most wonderful addition hitherto known, John the baptist, six months before the Messiah. No greater subjects, beloved brethren, could engage mortals or immortals, and they are here set before us; and relatively what may be deduced as applicable to ourselves is also transcendently great. The fact is that we have but little apprehension of the greatness of what we are engaged with; the most advanced of us is hardly equal to handling the great things we have to do with. And yet the lord graciously allows us to have to say to them and encourages us to go on, but with an increasing sense of responsibility that we have finally to give an account and that in the presence of the most scrutinising light, the divine eyes indeed.
So the angel departs as Mary takes the ground of subjection. She said, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word", and she is taken at her word. God loves to trust us, and the less we trust ourselves the more we shall be trusted divinely. God loves to trust us, but then, He knows us and trusts us according to His knowledge of us, not otherwise; He makes no mistakes. The angel departing implies clearly that she can be
{214}
trusted, and think, dear brethren, of the stupendous character of the trust. You would have said a legion of angels ought to be around her all the time with such a trust. We might think that, but no -- the angel departed from her. She is left alone; there is nothing said about Joseph coming in here; he has his place. But the stupendous nature of this trust, you might say, requires that all heaven should be around this person, this virgin, a young person, unprotected, left in this world with such a charge -- but the angel departed from her. Need I say, dear brethren, that heaven never lost sight of her, the eye of the Father never lost sight of this distinctive personage. Why then is it said the angel departed? Surely to call attention to her trustworthiness; and that is the point to begin with as to any addition for God, it is the principle of subjection, absolute surrender. "Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me", as she says, "according to thy word", and the angel accepts it and departs. It is all with you now, Mary -- as it were; and so it is, dear brethren, that in anything, however small, in which I might wish to add to what there is, the Lord will say, 'It is your matter now'. Well now, what is she going to do? Is she to remain alone to sit on a throne of distinction without a companion? No other person ever had or could have such distinction, only one person could have this distinction through all time or eternity; she had it. Is she to sit on a throne of distinction alone, occupying all of it, and having others come and bow down to her? No, that is not the divine way, nor is it the way of Him of whom she was to be presently the distinguished mother. No, "I am among you", He says, "as he that serveth". @Luke 22:27. It is a lowly attitude to take, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word", and what does she do? Well, the angel had been speaking to her about her kinswoman and
{215}
about her son. What does this mean? This means that if I get any accession of light from God, He will give me to understand there are others, that I am not alone in this distinction -- there is an Elizabeth, and she makes haste to get to her, she makes haste to get to the hill country where this other distinguished person lives. They are bound up in a common testimony and it is as if Mary were to say, 'I must be there; she will support me and I will support her', and so it was. She arrives: as we are told, she entered into the house of Elizabeth and saluted Elizabeth -- she is worthy of the salutation, as all the saints are. However distinguished I may be, I need the saints, they are worthy of my respect; I shall never love a person if I do not respect him.
So Mary salutes Elizabeth, and the result is a remarkable contribution, a remarkable addition to what was there -- I say to what was there, that is the fact as to Elizabeth. See what results, dear brethren, come out as I link on with my brethren who are, equally with myself, or relatively perhaps with myself, distinguished; see what comes out, what there is with me becomes enlarged, yea, something comes out unheard of before. What brought it out? The presence of Mary. As I visit and link myself on with the brethren, paying them due respect and affection, knowing them as acquainted with them by the Lord Himself, I bring out the very best there is with them, and then in return the very best in me will come out -- there is double addition. In truth, there were three persons now in this pious bond of fellowship in the hill country of Judah. What an environment we are in now; not simply these two great women, but the hill country of Judah. We have to think of the antecedents of Judah, its place in this great thought: it refers to the divine claims, the service of God, for, when Israel came out of Egypt, Judah was God's sanctuary
{216}
-- remarkable fact! And now we are in the very environment of it, and it is coming to light in these remarkable persons. They are in the hill country maintaining remarkable spiritual elevation, so that an unborn babe joins the fellowship. Is it not so, dear brethren, that the most unperfect amongst us, as we may call them, in such a holy state of things, such addition as this, that they too may act? Is it not possible for even the feeblest formation in a locality to be affected as a spiritual addition comes in? There is a general movement, the truth of the body comes out, for this is what it is; it is a question of the delicate means of communication so that the service of God goes on in a marvellous, you might say a miraculous, way. But how marvellous it is, and all through the voice of the mother of our Lord. It is the voice of Judah, it is his voice, you might say, penetrating that mother, the tender mediums, the fine mediums spiritually, so that the voice of Judah, "Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah", @Deuteronomy 33:7 affects Elizabeth; it affects the unborn babe, so that there is a precious circle, dear brethren, of fellowship, and all the outcome of one who knows how to act, she has something; hence what you find is that Mary's addition now comes to light. Her presence surely was an addition in the hill country: there was no more distinguished person in the universe. She made haste to get there, she is there, and now there is a result, but she has her addition, a mature one, not one springing up at the moment, for it is not said the Spirit came upon her -- it is rather a mature one. I do not go over the words of it, but anyone who does, anyone who followed them as I read them, will see that it is the product of a person who has learnt how to distinguish her inwards, as in Romans we are taught to analyse the different faculties and organs of affection functioning; she says her *soul* magnifies the Lord and her *spirit*
{217}
rejoices in God her Saviour. It is what *He* is doing, it is a question of God; she had become subject to His work and she knew it, and this is the holy product, the holy addition, as I have spoken of it, that we have in the hill country of Judah. It is a holy, elevated fellowship, dear brethren, and any of us, however feeble, who pursues the line indicated, has reached the same result, that is, leaving an addition.
Then in the last chapter we have two persons of another character; there are a great company of them at the present time -- I mean as they were before the Lord revealed Himself to them, they were wanderers. It has come before us today that the children of God are scattered abroad; those known to us, dear brethren, are but a tithe of the number, and the divine promise alluded to already is, I will gather others. Satan, the wolf, has scattered; God is gathering. The Lord Jesus died "not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad", @John 11:52. Gather them together into one! What a thought of unity that is! It is not simply christians in profession, but the *children of God*, real souls. Now these two persons are of that class and they are being gathered. It is no doubt exemplary, like gathering goes on today; every one of us here has, I suppose, experienced something of it, the gathering together of the children of God into one by the great Shepherd of the sheep who died for that very purpose that we should not be scattered abroad but gathered together into one. It is a perfect matter. And so they are amenable to the Lord's conversation with them; in fact He joins them. There is nothing haughty about them, no turning away from this stranger. Who is He? An unknown person to them. "Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?". @Luke 24:18.
{218}
Some person might come in this manner to such wanderers and they would not wish to hear him, so that the example of these two is to be noted; they are listening, and the more they listen the more they hear -- the most wonderful exposition of Scripture. Surely as moment after moment passed in this journey their souls must have been affected -- Who was this? Never man spake like this Man. And so it is, dear brethren, if we listen; and, if there is a wanderer here, I would say this to you, Do not despise any one who seems to be a stranger and ignorant of religious matters, give heed, and you may find that he knows more than the ancients. That is how it stands: unlikely persons know more than all the teachers at the present time. Hence they say later, "Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way?". Let no one here be haughty and turn away from one who may seem to him to be an ignoramus as to religious matters, as to what is current in the different convocations and among the great dignitaries of the churches. Do not turn away from him, he may have a message for you. And so they became more and more interested. I can understand their looking at each other, Did we ever hear such words as these? How often it happens, and souls are just affected and bowed inwardly and restored. Oh, what a need there is for restoration, dear brethren. The field is strewed with derelicts who have turned away, turned a deaf ear to those who would speak words of truth to them. So, as I said, one could imagine these two saying to one another, Who could this be?
Now the Lord made as though He would go further, but they *constrained* Him, and that is the word. Do not let a person go away in a hurry if he says something that causes your heart to burn, get him into the house, let him say more. They say, "Abide with us": @Luke 24:29 he is worthy of it a heaven-sent
{219}
messenger to restore your soul. Zacchaeus was glad to receive the Lord into his house; these were too, and the Lord was persuaded to go in, and He broke the bread, as we learn here. "He took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them". You say, that is peculiar entertaining; why did they not give to Him? But no, He gave to them; He is the Head of the house, He is the house-father, He is supreme in the house of God. One has likened it to a guest chamber in the house of God. The Lord of glory -- how fitting it is that He should direct and control. And He is the entertainer as well as the guest. What impressions He is casting around us, and these hearts are ready to receive them now. And then we are told their eyes were opened. You say, I wonder how it was I did not discern before -- how often one has said that to oneself, Why did I not see it before? Why? It is well to ask oneself. Some moral defect, it may be. I believe therein often lies the reason why we do not see. But still, their eyes were opened; it was divinely ordered that everything should happen as it did happen; it is a perfect picture of recovery. No one can portray things like the Spirit of God. It is not only a question of the recovery, but of the One who does it -- how perfect He is! Though you might think you are entertaining Him, He gives you to understand He is entertaining you, and everything is His; the bread they gave Him was His -- it is all His.
Now their eyes are opened -- I want to come to this addition. They have something now to carry back to Jerusalem that they never could have had except through this experience. And so it is with anyone here tonight who is ready to listen to the divine speaking, that you carry something back to the assembly. It is your place; why should you be away, a stranger to it? They returned the same hour and they came to the city. Did they know
{220}
where He resided? Did they know where John resided? It appears as though they had looked about a little. They found the eleven; one is not worth much who does not learn to find something. There are those of us who think that everything must be found for us. Indeed it is a truth that there are many of us who are just paupers, living on the brethren spiritually. Not that I would deny them that; not that I would deny anybody anything I could give them spiritually; but why not find something for yourself? They "found the eleven ... and them that were with them", that is, they are all included in the title. They sought out and found, and let me assure anyone here tonight that this is the principle. Do not sit down and wait for everything to be found for you; move a little and find what there is. Find those who maintain the rights of Christ; morally it is one of the greatest finds to find those who maintain the rights of Christ in the confusion of christendom: they are to be found -- thank God! I know nothing surer than the fact that I know those who maintain the rights of Christ; I have found them. This means I look about for them. But then they have *found* something, not just to talk about it in a fleshly way like Gehazi. We desecrate things we have by telling brethren as information what we have. The thing is to go to the place where they maintain the rights of Christ; put it there, it ceases to be yours peculiarly; it belongs peculiarly there now, it belongs to the brethren. To deny them what I have is unrighteous, it belongs to them. So they went to the company and they were just where and how they should be -- gathered together, and they were saying what they should say: they were saying, "The Lord is risen indeed" -- there was no question about it -- and He had appeared to Simon. And now these two say what they know. I suppose we may assume that this great fact about Simon was
{221}
carried into the company by Simon himself; he certainly added something. I can see him enter the door. Erstwhile he would have slunk away in shame that he had denied his Master, but now he says, It is all settled; I have seen the Lord, He saw me, He made it His business to see me. I should like to say to Simon, What did He say to you? How did He look? -- for all that enters into it. It was common property; He had appeared to Simon -- it is a question of grace. If He appeared thus to Simon, He would appear to any other poor sinner. Now these two have something; they are leaving something behind them; they are the only two who had this experience, and one might say that these experiences are peculiar to any person who has any one of them. The two had theirs; Peter only had his experience; Mary hers; Elizabeth hers, and so forth. Well, the two had the same experience. I would regard them as perfect testimony; they saw the same thing at the same time, both of them. They marvelled at it, they were moved by it. The way back from Emmaus must have been much easier than going the other way. You know it is so, "The way of transgressors is hard" @Proverbs 13:5, even if he has only one sin to confess; if he has his back to the Lord, he has a hard road. But now the Lord would appear to them, not simply as He appeared to Simon; you might say He appeared to them assembly-wise in the breaking of bread, a great thought already introduced into the testimony, now it is being verified: He is made known to them in the breaking of bread. Well, my point is, dear brethren, that by their confession they made an addition enabling Christ to come in, and that is a great matter. If I, in my little way, tend to create a condition into which Christ can come, I have done something, and it is within my reach; it is within the reach of every one of us to create a condition suitable to Christ. The Lord Himself, we are
{222}
told, stood in the midst of them as they were saying these things.
Well, the final word is just that we have two more sent persons. Not two prospective mothers, not two straying ones restored now, but two great servants of Christ, actively engaged and suffering. Can they not add? They have been added; no two men perhaps are more interesting than these two, Peter and John. They say, "Look on us", @Acts 3:5 and now they are sufferers for Christ. They had served successfully, they had added a great convert, and not only is he converted but he is holding them, he is in the fellowship, and he is a real addition to the fellowship. He is not promiscuously among three thousand; he is one person secured by these two men, a peculiar result of their service. He is with them, and they are suffering for Christ in their service. I speak now to those of us who are serving in greater or lesser measure, and, dear brethren, it is not a question of making a name at all, but rather of adding to the mutual state of things, for that is what happened; it is a mutual state of things. These two men find their own company, we are told, as released by the authorities and they tell the company what had happened and what the chief priests had said. So the result is that when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord and said, "Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is". The two great servants then in active service returning with grace -- morally and literally, one result was they merged in the company, and, in merging, they added to the company: the company rejoiced by what they saw. The addition is a levitical addition, if you understand me. The minister certainly ought to be able to add by what be is ministerially to what he is in the company. Think of these men speaking together, there is Peter, there is John, what lowly
{223}
men they are, how different from the high priests, how different from the doctors of the law; how they sit down as amongst us, for those who lift up their voice are not simply Peter and John, it is the company. One might assume that neither Peter nor John did this; it is a question of the company, of what is mutual, that I can merge with the brethren and add to them through merging; it is a great levitical addition. Every young brother in the place would be affected that these great servants who are so successful, such sufferers too, can come and sit down amongst us and tell us just simply what had been said, and all know it and they lift up their voice to God and call Him Master or Despot. It is a question of humility, it is a question of an addition, dear brethren, brought in levitically that produces humility. It is a very unusual address to Jehovah, the word is Master or Despot, as the margin reads. As much as to say, Peter and John are not conveying to the company that they are doing great things, it is that they are, bondmen, that God is doing great things and He is going to do great things, and that without Him there are no great things. And so their prayer is to Him as a Despot and they appeal to Him as the Creator and how everything under His hand goes well, and it is all a question of His holy Servant Jesus. (This is a word that may be rendered 'child', but it is really 'servant' -- "thy holy servant Jesus".) It is through Him they are acting now; you see, dear brethren, what a holy savour for those who minister to spread abroad in the company! that He is addressed as an Owner of slaves, for after all, what is it but that? We are amongst the slaves and He is doing things by us, -- but it is through His holy Servant Jesus. They recorded what happened in Jerusalem and then they say, "to do whatever thy hand and thy counsel had determined before should come to, pass". And then they say,
{224}
"Now, Lord, look upon their threatenings, and give to thy bondmen with all boldness to speak thy word, in that thou stretchest out thy hand to heal, and that signs and wonders take place through the name of thy holy servant Jesus", Then, "when they had prayed, the place in which they -- were assembled shook, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God with boldness", I think you can follow what I mean there, dear brethren, from the ministerial or levitical side, addition coming in with the attitude of those who serve; others will follow. There is only a few years and every one of us who is serving now will have gone; if the Lord continues His testimony others are to follow. What better addition can I leave than an addition proper to a levite that others may emulate and take on, and the Lord will help in it, as He has helped others of us; and hence it is no longer Peter and John that are being used, but the apostles, all gainers by what the apostles Peter and John brought in at this particular time.
{225}
GOD'S ASSEMBLY
@1 Corinthians 1:1 - 3; @1 Corinthians 11:17 - 22; @1 Corinthians 14:23 - 25; @1 Corinthians 12:28
J.T. What is in mind is to consider the assembly, that is, how it is employed as such as seen in this letter. There are other scriptures bearing on the subject, but these four are selected to show: firstly, the general thought, that it is God's assembly in any given place; then, secondly, that it is employed locally for the service of God, inclusive of the celebration of the Lord's supper; and, thirdly, that it is viewed as in chapter 14, come together in all its members, that is in each person belonging to it, for spiritual ministry, and that it is itself to be ministered to and that this ministry is to be edifying; and then, fourthly, that the gifts are set in it according to chapter 12, implying its universal bearing. This will lead, I believe, to our seeing perhaps more clearly than before that, even as used in the celebration of the Lord's supper, it is still God's assembly, and therefore the thought of God in the sense of ownership and control attaches to it, even whilst the Lord's supper is being celebrated, for, as to the very subject of the Lord's supper, the apostle says, "Do ye despise the assembly of God?". Their conduct implied that they despised the assembly of God in what they were doing. So that, although the celebration of the Lord's supper is limited to the dominical idea, as the passages in chapters 10 and 11 which relate to it show, the thought of *God* is not to be ignored. Is what I have said clear, do you think?
F.W. In that way is it the service of God right through?
J.T. Yes, it all enters into the service of God, the Lord's supper included.
{226}
Ques. Will you say a little more what you mean as to the assembly being employed in this epistle?
J.T. Well, it is conveyed, I think, in the verses read from chapter 11, "When ye come therefore together into one place, it is not to eat the Lord's supper", meaning that they were not conducting themselves rightly because of the way they acted; it should have been the Lord's supper; that was the intent. They were to come together in assembly to break bread, to celebrate the Lord's supper; and so in @Acts 20:7, "we being assembled", it says "to break bread", that is, the thing itself is necessary now. It had been done in houses, according to @Acts 2, but now it necessitates the assembly; the assembly indeed is employed by the Lord, and singing in it is referred to in Hebrews; and it also has the place of the house of God in Hebrews, "Whose house are *we*, if indeed we hold fast the boldness and the boast of hope firm to the end" @Hebrews 3:6, so that it takes on the character of the sanctuary. Do you think that is right?
Rem. Yes. I was thinking perhaps we have looked at the assembly more as the place of our enjoyment, instead of seeing what it is for God, as you speak of it, to be employed for Him.
J.T. Yes, and in that respect I suppose we should not overlook the Lord's first word as to it: "I will build my assembly" @Matthew 16:18, He says, as if He would use it thus.
P.L. Is it the vessel for God's testimony as to His rights over the earth: "The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof" @Psalm 24:1, among other thoughts?
J.T. It is the vessel He has now -- quite so, as of old He had Israel. Only that the thought of the service of God was brought down to a special family, Aaron and his house and the Levites; they had
{227}
a material tabernacle, but it is the same idea; the assembly takes the place, not only of the tabernacle but of Israel itself. The primary thought of Israel was that it was to be a nation of priests and God was to have it in that peculiar way among the nations; now He has the assembly.
F.I. Do you mean in the Lord's supper there is a service that goes on in a dual way, that is, what is due to God and what is due to the Lord, at the same time?
J.T. Well, 'at the same time' brings it down to detail, which is worthy of consideration. The dominical part, as we rightly speak of it, implies that it is in regard of the Lord Himself, that there is something that relates to Himself in it. Some of us lately were speaking of a certain king making a marriage for his son. The king took control of the marriage feast; there is nothing at all about the son appreciating it there but what is kept in mind is what the king did for his son. I think, in a general way, that is applicable to what we are speaking of; it is God's assembly and He honours His Son in it. But then the celebration of the Lord's supper has a special place. It will not go on in the world to come, as far as we can see; it refers only to the period of the Lord's absence from this world; it is necessitated by that indeed, so it is not a continuous thought. The service of God will go on eternally, but the Lord's supper is a special thing that involves relations between Himself and His own, the assembly itself, during the period of His absence: so it is to be considered in that light and therefore it is a dominical thought, whereas in general the service is God's, God honours the Son and the Son honours the Father, for the Lord has laid down that the Son must be honoured as the Father is honoured. So the great feast in @Matthew 22 would point, in a general
{228}
way, to how God honours Christ, but the assembly is the sphere of it. Do you think that?
F.I. Yes. What you have in mind is the great thought of assembly service; what is due to the Lord will uphold this.
J.T. It has in mind that part, and is provisional, only applying to the period of the Lord's absence from this world, but the Lord's service will go on millennially and eternally.
P.L. Is that special part more inward and spiritual, hence "My assembly"? If it is God's assembly, is that God's rights in relation to His service and testimony in a more public way?
J.T. I think He has rights in it; it is put in that way, He has purchased it. It is a peculiar expression, "purchased with the blood of his own" @Acts 20:28, the blood of Christ; but it has cost Him that, and He has rights in it and He implies it here. If He wishes to honour His Son in it, He can do that freely and He does. Another thing that is provisional is the house of God, the idea referring to the earth; it will not apply eternally as far as I see. We have the Father's house, but the house of God refers to what we get in Israel and is continued on now and will be, as Ezekiel shows, in the millennium too. So there are provisional ideas attaching to the assembly, that is, ideas that are not permanent, and the Lord's supper is included in these. I think it is worth while viewing the matter in this way, so that we may have suitable thoughts as we eat the Lord's supper, that a wider circle is involved, not called into activity, but about to be, and intelligence enables us to act rightly in each position.
F.I. Does the primary thought of the assembly stand in relation to God, but He employs it to honour His Son?
J.T. Yes, He honours His Son down here in @Matthew 22 and in @Luke 14, too.
{229}
Ques. Have you in mind that this relates to a locality particularly in this provisional setting you are speaking of?
J.T. It does, that is how it stands, I think. That is why I selected this epistle for it affords more light, I think, as to the assembly and the use made of it divinely than any other. The more one looks into it the more remarkable are the number of references to it, not only the word 'assembly', but the body of Christ and the temple of God; and indeed it is in that verse called "the Christ", meaning it is an anointed vessel here, as He was for God.
E.G. The first thought as to the tabernacle was that God should dwell among them.
J.T. That is quite true. In the antitype that is seen in Ephesians, but it is the primary thought of God; primary thoughts are generally thrown out first in scripture and details follow.
P.H. Will you say another word as to the Lord's singing in the assembly in @Hebrews 2?
J.T. I only mentioned it there just now because of the question of the Lord using it coming up, how it is used, that that is one of the uses made of it, He sings in the assembly; but in itself that leads us on to the final thought in the assembly, that is not a provisional thing, it is what we shall enjoy finally.
P.H. I thought you were referring to the use made of the assembly by Christ just as you were referring to the use made of the assembly by God for the celebrating of His Son -- did I understand you to say that that goes into eternity -- @Hebrews 2?
J.T. I believe that is the first note after the Lord Jesus arises from amongst the dead, "I will declare thy name to my brethren; in the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises" @Hebrews 2:12; that is a final thought, a primary and final thought.
{230}
Ques. Does that not belong to the universal position now, but what we are considering at the moment is the local setting?
J.T. It does. I thought, in order to understand the subject, we ought to take it as it is here. 1 Corinthians does not go as far as that; it is very initial but very essential.
A.W.R. Does that emphasise the greatness of the vessel of praise in @Hebrews 2?
J.T. It does. Our first consideration is what the assembly is as seen in the first scripture read -- the assembly of God which is in Corinth. It is seen throughout from this point of view and is indeed in one passage ranged alongside the Jew and the gentile, so that it is very specifically the public side of the assembly that is in mind.
Rem. In Corinth it takes account of all that were in the place as over against it.
J.T. That is obvious; not simply all the Lord's people in Corinth, but the assembly of God -- the Jew, the gentile and the assembly of God -- a known public thing there; a most important thing to keep before us, because it is what God has as over against what man has. The title "the Christ" applied to it in chapter 12 would mean it is anointed as Christ was anointed here in testimony.
Ques. Do you not get a cluster of beautiful thoughts suggested in @Psalm 74:2, "Remember thine assembly, which thou hast purchased of old, which thou hast redeemed to be the portion of thine inheritance, this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt"?
J.T. A very rich allusion to what we are speaking of, but going further really than this epistle: it brings in mount Zion. You might think he was alluding to all Israel, and in a way he is, but he is linking up in his mind the more spiritual side of the
{231}
position, mount Zion; that is where the whole matter lay.
Ques. Is the apostle concerned that the assembly might be available locally in a right state for the Lord's use?
J.T. Yes, that is in mind. They were to purge out the old leaven; then he says, "according as ye are unleavened" @1 Corinthians 5:7 -- they are held fundamentally to be for God.
Reverting to what has been quoted from @Psalm 74, the psalms are very rich in allusions to what we have been speaking of. Take any of the three great holy convocations; there were seven, but three are selected in Deuteronomy, that is, the feast of the passover, the feast of Pentecost and the feast of tabernacles, I think in the reference in the psalm what God had on any of those occasions would be in mind. If we view them abstractly and assume that they were just as God would wish them to be, that the people came up in holy separation to God, full of Himself, full of praise and full of reverence for Himself and love to one another, what He would have at any given time in Jerusalem on any such occasion! That would be Israel, that would be the assembly that He had.
Ques. Would not that bring to pass an exercise to be constantly living, as it were, in the enjoyment of communion with God as each one composing the assembly in any locality?
J.T. The males came up before God in Deuteronomy. It was from the divine point of view a very great matter, and not one was to be empty. So you can see the myriads of Israel as they went up, how pleasing they were to God even in going up, what joy He had in His people, joying over them with singing. Well now, we ought to be able to reach such a thought in our localities, bringing it down to any locality, and this whole matter is God's, He has
{232}
had it in mind and it has now come about, and this epistle would show that is dominical, it is the Lord. Divine authority is seen in the Lord, in Jesus, so that we have formally stated in this epistle, "There are gods many and lords many, yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom all things, and *we* for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and *we* by him", @1 Corinthians 8:6. So that the initial part of the service is the lordship of Christ, He has His own matter between Him and His saints, and the assembly too, for the bread denotes it; He has His own part with us, and we recognise that it is His part, it is the *Lord's* supper. It is a provisional matter whilst He is away, but it runs into the great matter of the service of God; that is a primary and eternal thought.
Ques. Would it be in keeping to refer to Exodus and the authority that was given to Moses, not only ministerially, but all the instruction, all that was for God dependent on the people listening to Moses? Is not that the start particularly in our localities?
J.T. That helps greatly, the service of Moses as typical of the Lord in His authority. So, as redeemed, it says they believed in the Lord and His servant Moses -- that is to say, they believed on the Lord Jesus. One is struck by much that Moses said of himself in Exodus, indicating that the Lord Jesus takes things on and carries them through in authority. He is making the assembly in its relations to Himself all the more suitable for the great primary and final thoughts.
Rem. In @Revelation 1:6 we get that we are a kingdom of "priests to his God and Father". @Revelation 1:6
J.T. He has done that -- that bears on what we are saying. Christ has made us a kingdom, as if He were to say, This is essential to the great end in mind. Then the next thing is, "priests to his God and Father".
{233}
P.H. In connection with what you have said as to Exodus, the word 'assembly' comes in in chapter 12 where God says to Moses, "Speak unto all the assembly of Israel" @Exodus 12:3. Would it be right to say that that is really God's assembly held in Israel and His instructions need obedience on our part to our Moses in order that we may begin to have part in the service of God?
J.T. Just so. That shows how the whole thought is involved in the word 'assembly', but it is really seen concretely in their celebrating something. He was approaching the great subject of the passover there, and so there are two words used, as we have often noticed; one denotes the assembly with enough persons to carry on, to execute whatever is in mind; the other word denotes every person that belongs to it, the passover requires that primarily, so that the next-door neighbour could be brought in to help to eat the lamb. But it is remarkable there that the word comes in as covering the whole nation, but with a view to a particular observance, which later is linked on, in Deuteronomy, with the feast of Pentecost and the feast of tabernacles. The idea would appear in a concrete way before God when they were celebrating these great occasions in which God would have part. When a man was ploughing his field or feeding his cattle or occupied with other industrial matters, that would not convey the thought of Israel being God's assembly; but then, God places His name in a certain place and they are to come there and not to appear before Him empty.
Ques. Does that emphasise the real importance of our gatherings together?
J.T. I think all we have been saying as to Israel does, what it was in the mind of God as God's assembly, and how that worked out in the males appearing before God in Jerusalem three times a year and not appearing empty. All that works out
{234}
in what we are speaking of; we have God before us in coming together.
Rem. I was thinking perhaps we have been a little inclined to think of the assembly in an abstract way because of local conditions, whereas in what you are saying as to Exodus, the thought applies, though all may not be present, and gives great force to our actual meetings.
J.T. It does. "All Israel that were present" @2 Chronicles 31:1 is mentioned in connection with Hezekiah in regard of one of these occasions, although the number was reduced. It is not a loose thought here of the persons themselves being it because we are nominally of it, but there is an exercise leading up to it.
H.O.E. Would that be indicated in @Mark 14:26, "Having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives"; all joined in?
J.T. Yes, that would clearly be a movement in the service of God. You can see in the tribes going up what exercise there would be, and every step would imply they were going to meet God. How important that every step should imply intelligence!
P.L. So "They go from strength to strength: each one will appear before God in Zion", @Psalm 84:7.
J.T. Very good -- "strength to strength" -- we are not jaded when we get there.
Ques. It is a universal gathering; would we always have what is universal in view when we come together in assembly?
J.T. Yes, in a secondary way; we have primarily the thought of the local position before us. They came together, "we being assembled to break bread" @Acts 20:7, that can never be anything else but a local position now; but we work up to the other; we have the other in mind.
Rem. I was thinking of the first passage read, "with all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ".
{235}
J.T. The whole position is in mind, but it is "every place", it is every locality that is referred to: we have the universal thought, only in the sense of the number of gatherings there are in the world. But the other thought is the saints viewed personally as all of the assembly of God in a spiritual way; Ephesians contemplates this. The verses read contemplate the universality; they refer to the number of gatherings there are in the world, but the universal bearing spiritually is in Ephesians; that it is what we are, "One body and one Spirit" @Ephesians 4:4, that is the spiritual side; there are not two bodies or two houses of God, but there are many assemblies, and that is what is in mind in the first passage.
P.L. The unity, the catholicity, lying in the person.
J.T. That is it. You are glad to hear letters of commendation on the Lord's day morning; it is what the Lord has here while He is away; but Ephesians contemplates what He has spiritually, one great idea in assemblies.
Ques. Is that why God delights in the increase of the number of assemblies?
J.T. Quite so. The assemblies were increased day by day.
Ques. Does the loaf represent the universal thought?
J.T. Yes, it represents what is local and what is general, the local merges into the general. There are not two fellowships, there is the local and the general aspect of it, and both are in mind in this epistle.
Ques. Would it be right to say that we qualify for the general universal side by accepting the adjustment the Lord gives us in our localities?
J.T. I think that is right; it is a question of spiritual power. Many of us have part in the local setting, and the Lord takes account of it, whereas
{236}
we may not enter on the universal side of the service of God.
Ques. Would this in any sense connect with the thought of the assembly in the wilderness, the saints viewed in their localities, all linked together, but not so much the heavenly side as reached, but on the way to it?
J.T. That is right. We rightly sing, 'In wilderness surroundings'. (`376:2). This town is a wilderness to the brethren as they sit down together, but then they pass out of that, in the measure in which they have spiritual power, into the divine realm.
Rem. So in the addresses to the seven churches the Lord is calling attention to this thought, in Ephesus and so forth, what is in the town.
J.T. That is helpful, that is what we have here. It is well for young people to dwell on this a bit, because the Lord is helping us on these lines, and it would be a great matter to have all the young people moving along with the truth; because things are stated in the clearest possible manner in a meeting like this, for example, and next Lord's day, in the assembly service, you find them contradicted by what is said, in the hymns given out, and the like. So it is well for us all to be on the alert as to what God is leading us on in, so that we are all in it.
Rem. That we might act together as intelligent people in the assembly, and especially on the Lord's day morning.
J.T. Yes, and that all the assemblies should be governed by the same principles, "Thus I ordain in all the assemblies" @1 Corinthians 7:17, the apostle says.
P.H. Is the preparation for this, as to the celebration of the Supper and God's service, in our coming together "in assembly"; not so many individuals coming together as an automatic matter, but *in assembly*?
{237}
J.T. That is the next thing to notice, that the wording in chapter 11:17 is, "But in prescribing to you on this which I now enter on, I do not praise, namely, that ye come together, not for the better, but for the worse. For first, when ye come together in assembly, I hear there exist divisions among you". And then he goes on to say (verse 20), "When ye come therefore together into one place, it is not to eat the Lord's supper", clearly meaning that it ought to have been that, only their conduct forbad them enjoying the Lord's supper; they came together in assembly for that purpose.
F.I. It might help us if you would tell us the distinction between coming together in assembly in chapter 11, and the whole assembly come together in one place. Some of us, I think, may not be clear as to that.
J.T. Well, the distinction pointed out in @Exodus 12 will help. Before any remarks are made, perhaps we might listen while the note to @Exodus 12:6 in the New Translation is read. ('Congregation is, I apprehend, the actual subsisting congregation composed of all its members; assembly, more the congregation looked at as a moral whole, a corporate person before God'.) These remarks have been a great help in entering on what we are saying now. @1 Corinthians 11 alludes to the latter definition; all the saints may not be present, but, as it is said, a moral whole, that is, enough are there for the idea, for one whole idea, so that the Lord's supper should be celebrated. Chapter 14 alludes to the other definition, namely, all the saints personally being present as the assembly in one place, every member present.
P.L. It needs as many as possible in the city for hearing the word of God, in chapter 14; whereas in the earlier setting in relation to the Lord's supper, it is a question of what is most serviceable in regard
{238}
of numbers and subdivisions in that way where there are several gatherings for the service of God.
J.T. Quite so. God obtains more from a number of gatherings, from four in a city for instance, than from one, even though the one had as many persons as the four. The idea of one whole that is alluded to in the note read just now is perhaps little understood, but it is very essential to the idea of the service of God, especially the Lord's supper. We must arrive at one idea, that we are not simply so many persons, but "we being many, are ... one body" @1 Corinthians 10:17; that is stressed in relation to the Lord's supper, so we must learn to merge with one another in the power of the Spirit. So, running right through Scripture, beginning with Exodus in relation to the passover, we have the thought "neither shall ye break a bone thereof" @Exodus 12:46. Now if every member were essential, an absentee would forbid the service, because all were not present. Where the whole idea is included in that a bone shall not be broken, the framework stands, and the more spiritual the persons are the more the framework would appear; hence we have, "neither shall ye break a bone thereof", and Joseph's bones, mentioned at the same time. Whether it be Christ, whether it be the assembly, whether it be any one of us, the thought goes through.
Rem. Thomas was absent, but that did not interfere with the Lord's coming.
J.T. It did not, because when you come to @Acts 2 the spiritual understanding was present, so it says they were all together.
F.I. So would it be right to say that, in chapter 11 the thought is more what is characteristic as having the whole thing in view, not the whole being there?
J.T. Just so; we might have twenty-five subdivisions, and it would apply, they are all together in this attitude, together in assembly. So in Josiah's
{239}
passover we have the remark, "All ... Israel that were present" @2 Chronicles 35:18, that is, you have enough of Israel for the thought.
Ques. Does "the many", in @2 Corinthians 2:6 in connection with the rebuke, imply the moral whole?
J.T. It does imply it; "the many" would mean the whole thought was there.
Ques. There were a number of subdivisions in Corinth; does this letter refer to one of them, or did what we get here characterise all the subdivisions in Corinth?
J.T. It would appear it did. We cannot say there were many subdivisions; there may have been; if so, this must have characterised them all. It would look as if they were all characterised by certain things.
Rem. So one subdivision cannot wash its hands of what takes place in another in the same town.
E.G. That is very important, because whatever happens in one meeting in this town happens in the other; whatever attaches to one attaches to the other. And if there is an elder in this town in one of these meetings, he has to say to the other, too; he is appointed for the city.
J.T. I think that is good; for if one of the gatherings was immune, in one sense, from what we have as in chapter 5, it was not in another sense; it was in the city and they had to take on the obligation for it.
P.H. And God being "amongst you" would apply to all in the same way. "He will do homage to God, reporting that God is indeed amongst you".
J.T. That is amongst the saints at Corinth; that is alluding to the assembly viewed, as you read from the note, as composed of all its members.
Ques. Are not both expressions used in chapter 14?
{240}
J.T. It says, "If therefore the whole assembly come together in one place". There may be an allusion there to subdivisions, but this meeting does not admit of any subdivisions; all must be present.
Ques. What is the difference between that and chapter 11, "When ye come therefore together into one place"?
J.T. That would be whatever the position was, the 'ye' would refer to any subdivisions. Chapter 11 bears throughout on a possible subdivision or subdivisions; the 'ye' would be just the persons in any subdivision.
Rem. Does it not stand over against the thought of houses in that connection, whereas chapter 14 stands more over against the thought of subdivisions? The "one place" would be in contradistinction to the thought of houses to eat and drink in; whereas "the whole assembly in one place" would be all the saints gathered together in one place literally.
J.T. Just so. I think the Lord is helping on this point, enabling some of the brethren to see that all the assembly together in one place for ministry is right, and we may expect more from it than from the same kind of a meeting in different subdivisions; we should find the idea of the temple of God working out more. "Ye are the temple of God, and ... the Spirit of God dwells in you" @1 Corinthians 6:19 would work out more effectively in all the saints being in one place than if they are meeting in subdivisions.
F.I. So you would expect more power and help in a general reading than in a reading in a subdivision.
P.L. So that, where possible, a reading weekly in a city as a whole would be desirable.
J.T. I think that has worked out with great effect. One has ventured to commend it to the brethren that, however many subdivisions there may be, the brethren should be together once a week if possible.
{241}
It is due to God that what He has in the town should be seen together.
P.L. The assembly's history in the town being a weekly one commencing with the first day of the week.
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. You would not call @1 Corinthians 14 a formal convening of the assembly?
J.T. It would only be in that way, for ministry. It does not say "come together in assembly", it is the whole assembly coming together in one place; so that the stress is not so much on our attitude as assembling, but that all are there and all are there for the purpose in mind, namely for ministry, particularly prophecy. So that verse 26 enlarges on it by saying, "What is it then, brethren? whenever ye come together, each of you has a psalm" @1 Corinthians 14:26; you can see that is not for the Lord's supper, it is a question of what you have to give out to the brethren.
P.L. So He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground in Matthew in one of the feedings, there are no subdivisions; whereas in Luke, where the service of God is more in mind, the subdivisions are in evidence: they sat down in fifties.
J.T. That is good.
Ques. Is the suggestion here of what you said earlier that the assembly should take the place of Israel in making God known? An unbeliever comes in and God is made known to his conscience.
J.T. It is perfectly evident that what God set out in Israel has taken form in the assembly.
Ques. Is the assembly so delightful to God that, although there is public failure, He provides for it to go on in 2 Timothy, as Moses did in @Exodus 32?
J.T. Yes. We can see how the holy convocations went on; in fact the brightest one is in the days of Hezekiah. It says, "Since the time of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, there had not been the like in Jerusalem", @2 Chronicles 30:26.
{242}
Now the final scripture is in chapter 12, the assembly in the same sense only in its universal bearing as having the gifts in it. "God has set certain in the assembly: first, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers; then miraculous powers; then gifts of healings; helps; governments; kinds of tongues". Gifts might be seen in Jerusalem, or anywhere in a way, but it is the universal thought; it is not an office, but a question of power or ability.
Ques. Why the change from the body to the assembly?
J.T. I think just for the reason we are speaking of, that the word 'assembly' denotes what God has in this public way; the truth of the body lies in the Spirit more; it is more the inner working of the assembly. The assembly is dependent on the body for its working, but the assembly denotes a number of persons called out, but so constituted that they act with intelligence, are amenable to God and representative of God, a vessel anointed which He can employ according to His purpose in this world for testimony. We can see it now, but presently we shall see it in relation to the millennium and then in relation to eternity.
Ques. God has 'set' them; what do you say as to that?
J.T. It is in accord with what we are saying; it belongs to God. We have been looking at certain ways in which He uses it now: He uses it for this purpose -- He puts all His gifts there like a setting of precious stones, they are set where they are enhanced, they are supported by the assembly and they adorn the assembly, they are representative of God in it.
F.I. Chapter 12 is not confined to a local setting, but chapter 14 is; is that right?
{243}
J.T. All we have been speaking of would be local, you might see it at Jerusalem or Antioch, but it is the universal thought, what God has in this scene as inclusive of all the local gatherings in the world.
Ques. Why does 'evangelist' not come in here; it does in Ephesians?
J.T. I think the allusion would be to the poverty, that it is a sort of rebuke that evangelisation is absent.
P.L. No branches could go over the wall; there was no wall at Corinth.
Ques. Do you see the thought in @Acts 13:1, "Now there were in Antioch, in the assembly which was there, prophets and teachers" and that leads to the branches going over the wall in that case?
J.T. Yes, conditions were there for it, so two great evangelists are sent out. It is very beautiful to see there the richness of the work of God, the product at Antioch, and do you not think the Spirit would remind us that the foundation at Antioch was by Paul and Barnabas, although the scattered ones began to preach there first? Paul and Barnabas taught a great crowd in the assembly for a year, a remarkable statement, showing that the great idea of the assembly is not only teaching but exemplification in the persons who are learning; the idea is there all the time: they were taught in the assembly for a whole year. So that we are reminded of the need of learning how to be in assembly, how to sit in assembly; the outlook, the attitude of mind, how we are ready for the great divine uses, so that the service of God may go on, whatever it may be.
Ques. A complete period, would you not say, a whole year?
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Why does the apostle number these things? "First ... secondly ... thirdly" -- then he adds, "miraculous powers; then gifts of healings; helps; governments; kinds of tongues".
{244}
Is there a reason for stressing the order?
J.T. I should think the apostles, prophets and teachers are the three great ones; they are superior to any sign gifts. There are no sign gifts mentioned in Ephesians and the order is as here, save that the word 'evangelists' is left out; the order in Ephesians is, "apostles ... prophets ... evangelists ... shepherds and teachers". @Ephesians 4:11.
Ques. Would it be right to say that, to benefit by the minor gifts, you have to appreciate these others? Would the apostles make way for the teaching, which is a more steady thing?
J.T. Quite so. It is most important that the truth is forced into your mind by teaching, and you know what to do as taught, how to take part in the assembly and the service of God.
P.L. Does "after that" suggest in a moral way, that is to say that there is nothing God has put there that does not serve you?
J.T. Yes, the "miraculous powers", whatever they may include; then gifts of healings, helps, governments, kinds of tongues. These, you mean, would have their full place; they are not noted in the order but they will have their full place if people are taught.
P.H. Does that mean the state of things in any locality can only be put right as these things have their place with us?
J.T. I think so. I think if Paul were present and there is a man with a gift of government, he would even be silent to let him speak -- it is so important. Persons who have profited by the other gifts would say, We do not need to make much of miraculous healing, for the testimony of christianity has gone far and wide. Occupy yourself with what is needed; teaching is needed.
{245}
CHRIST'S THRONE
@Revelation 3:21; @Matthew 25:31 - 46; @Matthew 19:28; @Luke 1:32
I wish to speak about Christ's throne, not primarily in a prophetic sense, but as to its bearing at the present time. What properly belongs to the future reflects backward, and Christ's throne is included in this peculiarly, for we are to have part in it; at least, the twelve apostles will, and the overcomers in the assembly of Laodicea will, so that in principle the saints characteristically will have part in Christ's throne. Therefore present education comes into mind; for, as in regard to all our great destinies, we are to be prepared for them so that we may fit and adorn them.
This subject affords opportunity for help as to the idea of the throne. As it is in the mind of God, it is peculiarly essential to our present education, for we have arrived, in prophetic history, at a time of iron and clay. The divine thought in the head of gold of the image which Nebuchadnezzar saw and which Daniel explained is being lost to view in the world. What is of God relative to the government of this world is being beclouded, and it behoves the saints who are in God's secrets to assert what the enemy would obliterate. And so the idea of the throne is stated most concisely in the first verse read, that is, the Father's throne in which Christ has part now, and the Son's throne, which is for the moment in abeyance, but in which, as He takes it up, we shall have part. The matter comes close to us and raises the issue of government, of rule, in each as we are before God; for a man who learns to rule his own spirit is greater than he that takes a city (@Proverbs 16:32). So that the idea begins with oneself; it is reached as
{246}
each believer, according to divine processes, is able to say, "I *myself* with the mind serve God's law", @Romans 7:25. He is controlled in himself and resolves, as in control, to serve God's law: nor can there be any throne according to God save such as has, for its basis, God's law -- the throne of the universe, if we may speak of it thus, for the Father is addressed by the Son as "Lord of heaven and earth". @Matthew 11:25. @Luke 10:21. Rule must be in accord with what He is, and that is the law that governs the universe. So, as I said, beginning with oneself, we learn this great abiding principle, God's law, not in any specific character, but as a governing principle. Whatever may be required, God must prevail.
This leads to overcoming, seen both in Christ and in the saints. The Father was on the throne; the Lord addressed Him in that way: "I praise thee, Father", He says, "Lord of the heaven and of the earth". @Matthew 11:25. @Luke 10:21. He was the sovereign Ruler, and that throne, the Father's throne, became the very centre of our present dispensation. We are here tonight in the understanding of it and in the security that it assures to the saints, that what is involved in it is achieved, namely, unmitigated grace. It is the *Father's* throne; the gospel issues forth from it, and so does everything that is benign; all is to be enforced authoritatively. There is authority behind the gospel, for "God ... now commandeth all men every where to repent" @Acts 17:30; that is authority, but it is grace. So in regard to the great servants that were fitted and furnished to go forth, they carried with them the credentials of that throne. It is not merely the announcement of the gospel in terms, but in such power as to enforce it in grace, "Compel them to come in". @Luke 14:24. Think, dear brethren, of the position as presented in the parable of the great supper: "A certain man made a great supper" @Luke 14:16, and he was determined that that house should be filled, and it was filled. "Compel them to come in".
{247}
It is all the outcome of the Father's throne. It is just a symbol which men would understand, meaning that, in the proclamation of the gospel, of which love is the source, there is power and authority. Men are made doubly responsible; they are responsible for passing by the best thing possible in refusing the gospel, and they are responsible for ignoring divine authority.
Jesus overcame in relation to that throne; He is the Leader in overcoming. "As *I* also have overcome", He says, "and have sat down with my Father in his throne"; that is to say, He carried through inviolably, in His ministry, the great principles of grace, as attested in the gospel, in a variety of ways. "They have both seen and hated both me and my Father", @John 15:24 He said. It was in the expression, in the maintenance, in the carrying through, of the principle of overcoming, that He has seated Himself with His Father in His throne. Let us note this well. The Father's throne is occupied by an overcomer, the idea being that He has overcome in all things that that throne stands for; He has attested to them here below and carried them through inviolably, suffering even unto death, making atonement to make it possible, and has sat down with His Father in His throne. Think of the rightness of the position that He has reached as a Man on the principle of overcoming, so that what He is administering down here is what He knows by experience; what we are engaged in here tonight is known experimentally by Christ. He knows the full force of all that any true evangelist ever experienced or taught. Be it the preaching, He has preached, we are told, the glad tidings to them that were afar off and to them that were nigh. He did it, having experienced the thing down here and having overcome in regard of it, carried the thing right through; He has been seated with His Father as an overcomer on His Father's throne.
{248}
Think of the link between us, dear brethren; if in any little measure we are overcomers, the point of sympathy there is between that glorious Person above and ourselves below! So that the gospel is carried on, for the Father judges no one; hence His throne is for the promulgation of the glad tidings and of all that the Father devises for the blessing of man in this dispensation, and it is administered by the One who has come down here in the very position in which we are. This is a word for us here in the very last period of the assembly's history, which Laodicea represents. He says, "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne". What an incentive to go right through now! We are drawing near the end and there is great pressure to cause us to give up. The matter grows wearisome with some, hence the need of maintaining freshness of soul in the service; weariness there may be *in* it, but not *of* it, as has often been remarked. Weariness there may be, and the Lord knows that; He has overcome in service and He knows how to support us. Let us think of the greatness of what the Lord has to present to men, flowing from the Father on His throne, which will, as we proceed to the end, ensure us not only a place on Jesus¬ throne, but a place *with Him* in it. Not that He vacates it for a moment, but it is a place *with Him* in it -- how one covets that! This is the result of overcoming in Laodicea.
Now in @Matthew 25 we have the throne of His glory -- a beautiful expression. "When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory". There has never been, nor ever will be, anything so glorious, such heavenly and holy pomp, as when the Lord of glory appears thus. He comes in His glory -- how wide that thought is! -- and the
{249}
holy angels with Him -- all the myriads of them. What a scene, dear brethren, as over against human pageantry! What a glorious prospect is this! And then, He sits on the throne of His glory -- as if to enhance the thought. His love for His people is what shines here; so that, in any measure in which we come into the idea of His throne, the obvious lesson is that it must subserve the saints. Any ability I have in the way of rule, or personal influence, must subserve the well-being and blessing and protection of the people of God. What a fine field opens up to us: the youngest believer can protect his fellow-believers; any christian, whatever little ability or influence he has, can use it to serve the saints. It is in accord with the throne of Christ's glory. Let another molest them, let another ill-treat them, the glory of Christ and His throne is involved. Woe be to those who ill-treat the people of God, the brethren of Christ! It is a question now, not of the *power* of His throne, but the *glory* -- the throne of His glory; and what can His glory be more, second to His love to His Father, than His love to the saints? It is the shining out of the glory of Christ.
It is a question of His brethren, how they are to be treated. "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me": He says that from the throne of His glory. Am I a stranger to it? Any little influence I exercise for the good of the brethren is a reflection of this throne; it is the throne of His glory, it is the Son of man coming in His glory and all the holy angels with Him. Think of the array, the retinue -- "all the angels"; who can count them? They are all with Him, as Enoch of old prophesied: "Behold, the Lord has come amidst his holy myriads", @Jude 14. I am speaking now of the glory attached to it and our being qualified for it if we are to have part in it presently, and what we do now, how we regard the
{250}
saints, the brethren of Christ. He explains: "I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink" -- notice how He goes over the details -- "I was a stranger, and ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto me". See how the Lord goes over the little things, as we may call them. We understand well enough, I believe, the prophetic bearing of this chapter; I am not speaking of that so much, but of the present bearing of it, the reflection of it on ourselves as we have part in this. Have I part in it? Am I learning this glorious matter, the matter of the throne of His glory, and that it refers to the saints, our treatment of the brethren? How dreadful to ill-treat the brethren! Think of what you are doing: you are dishonouring the throne of His glory; you are doing dishonour to yourself if you are one of His children. In a variety of ways we may ill-treat one another. We may fail in what is positive, even if we do not actually ill-treat them. As He says, "I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink". He is speaking to us from the throne of His glory; that is, the throne that is peculiarly fitted for the shining out of what He is in relation to His brethren.
We turn with sorrow to the awful scene that is in mind, but the glory is shining; let us not be afraid, dear brethren, of discriminatory judgment among the brethren, for it is glory. The judicial glory attaching to the saints is a matter of great importance, and if we are obliged to be the executors of judgment in any way, there is glory attaching to it. We mourn the necessity, of course, but still judicial glory is glory, and it is seen here. It is not indeed the judgment exactly, it is the throne of glory, an executive throne. It is not simply a throne or a judgment-seat for enquiry into matters, it is an executive matter; that is, as applied to ourselves, it is an
{251}
assembly matter. There is no need of witnesses; the facts are all presented. The Lord says, "I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat". He is not raising the question; it is a fact. The facts are all stated, all attested, and it is a question of execution, not enquiry or deliberation -- that is the throne. So the terrible words: "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels". So, dear brethren, let us not be afraid of stating this. Matthew continually states that the extreme of judgment and the extreme of penalty should be executed on those who fail to do what is right to the brethren. Has that not a voice? I think it has. I should tremble to be found in the presence of this throne of glory in any way persecuting the Lord's people. But then, on the other hand, "the righteous into life eternal", namely, the righteous nations, from the prophetic point of view. This is a world matter in the full result; there has never been such an occasion as this before. The nations, it says, are all to be gathered before Christ, before the throne of His glory; and what an issue! It is no question of territorial rights, or the like, or possibility of war. No, the moral issue in this great matter is the saints, how they have been treated; and what a voice this has for us! "The righteous" -- how lovely to be amongst them! -- "into life eternal", that is to say, the saved nations. The chapter teaches us that those who ill-treat the Lord's people in a future day will go into everlasting punishment, but the righteous nations will enter into everlasting life.
Now I desire to say a word about the regeneration, in chapter 19. It is a question of following Christ, not now a world affair. Peter is enquiring what those who forsook all and followed Christ should have. It is a question now of the regeneration, and this brings out another matter that enters into our present position, namely, not only that we shall share in Christ's throne, but that there are twelve thrones.
{252}
The word 'regeneration' is only used once more in the New Testament, in @Titus 3:5, where it applies to the conversion and blessing of any believer. It is a great general thought and it applies at the present time, as it does in the future, for we have to do with the regeneration. If we are to rule amongst those who are regenerate in the regeneration, then certain qualifications are necessary. It is not now a question of looking after them, giving them food and drink and clothes and visiting them in prison. No, here it is a question of sitting on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel in the regeneration. God has begun to work over again -- the regeneration means that -- and He has brought in another order of things, and we have to do with this new order of things. It is all in our favour, and, as followers of Christ, we may have the privilege of judging in the midst of it, but judging the twelve tribes. Notice the number twelve, both in regard to the rulers and those to be ruled. How shall we rule among our brethren save in love, and how shall those ruled be ruled save as they are actuated by love? Think of the blessedness, dear brethren, of such a position, of the throne of Christ's glory. It is also called here, as you will observe, the throne of His glory. It is another view, but no less a view; it is a question now of the saints having each a throne. I believe verily that each believer has a throne in the measure in which he has power to influence in love; for what can this be otherwise? If I think of the twelve tribes of Israel, they are intact; they can never be broken up; it is a question of divine counsels. I look at the brethren from that point of view, and, as regards rule, I am standing in relation to others who do the same thing, that is, we are ruling on the principle of twelve, on the principle of influence in love. Let us each challenge his own heart: Did I ever influence a person on the principle of holy love? As soon as you begin to
{253}
influence on this principle, you begin to rule on the principle of the twelve thrones and you are ruling twelve tribes. They are intact, they refer to the saints, I understand, as available to heaven, amenable to the influence of heaven, but that influence exerted through persons. Each christian has it within his range to influence another and another and another; the wider his range the more distinguished his throne. I think you will follow, dear brethren, what I am meaning. The point is now to exercise influence in holy love. Would that I could set the brethren in movement! The very youngest can begin with influencing another, his sister or brother, or even his parents -- I have known of this -- influencing another in love. How fitting is the throne of Christ's glory in the midst of those twelve thrones!
Then, finally, there is the thought in Luke of Christ's throne as carrying down all that preceded it. It is a cumulative thought, and, in the light of this, I am moving in relation to the testimony from the beginning, and this leads me to the twenty-four elders who have thrones too, twenty-four thrones. Now the idea here is that Christ's throne carries down what preceded it. It is the throne of David and the rule is to be over the house of Jacob for ever, carrying down great thoughts from the seed-plot of God's testimony. I am aiming at enlargement in our view, that God's testimony is one, and, whatever I have, it is to maintain the great thought of it from beginning to end. Whatever influence I have, I allow that thought into my service, into what I am doing, into my general bearing and influence. Younger ones who need help come into it, into the greatness of the thing that this throne is to settle everything, to stabilise everything. It is the one place where it is said it goes on for ever. The throne of Christ is an eternal thought and it carries through every thread of divine authority and stabilises it, both at the
{254}
present time and in the future. "He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end" @Luke 1:32,33. It is His throne by inheritance; it is a hereditary throne. He comes into it, it is given to Him, and He rules over the house of Jacob for ever. It is a question of the vessels of the testimony and the whole matter being established on the principle of divine authority.
May God bless these thoughts to us!
{255}
BRETHREN OF CHRIST
@Acts 16:40; @Acts 7:12,13
My remarks at this time will be in relation to brethren, that is, brethren, as I hope to show, whom Christ can own as His. I am the more encouraged to turn to this subject as being in this city in which as the Lord graciously revived the truth, specially emphasising the blessed relations of brethren, the enemy sought to discredit the thought, not to set aside the use of the designation 'brethren', but to set aside and nullify what it really means. Disloyalty to Christ has sprung up, and disloyalty to Christ is utterly incompatible with the idea of the brethren of Christ. No one who is disloyal to Christ has any right morally to take the title of being one of the brethren of Christ. The brethren of Christ normally are the friends of Christ. There is what indeed is called "the brotherhood", @1 Peter 2:17 which is a thought which holds and binds us together in relation to any particular emergency in regard to the truth. So I think it opportune to bring this subject up here, that is, that what the enemy sought to set aside, and did to a very great extent by imitation, should stand out with peculiar lustre in this city, and in this section of the country too, that the term of family relationship should retain its original value as in the divine vocabulary. It had become dreadfully desecrated and hackneyed so as to be well-nigh lost where once it had its place; and, as with all other divine terms, the Lord would reinstate it in our souls, that it should shine in our relations with one another, and more particularly as representative of Christ in a family sense, that is, Christ seen in us in that relation, so that He is not ashamed in this regard to own all of us.
So I have selected this verse in @Acts 16 hoping to come to it later in my remarks, but just to touch on
{256}
it now as in its setting in Europe, how the idea is put down by the Spirit in this particular verse after the great victory achieved at Philippi. The martyrs, the witnesses of Christ, having been let go from the prison, came, we are told, to Lydia, and having seen the brethren, they exhorted them and departed; that is, the position is to be held by the brethren, and hence the exhortation. Now I have linked this verse on with those two in the seventh chapter so as to touch on the type, the great typical teaching on this subject in the book of Genesis. Joseph was made known to his brethren *the second time*. I want you to note that, and to proceed to note certain points in Genesis which are essential to our understanding the position, how it is that it was the second time, and not the first. They were known to him on the first visit, as on the second, but he was not known to them. Secondly, Joseph's kindred, or family, was made known to Pharaoh. Now it is in these first and second visits that the instruction largely lies, the instruction by which we reach the true thought of brethren of Christ. Whatever they pleaded the antecedent conditions had been, there was a murderous condition in ten of them, but true brotherly state in one of them; that is, the element was there in one of them, and in that sense in all of them, in one amongst them, an important point, dear brethren, as regards this in our local settings. How much value attaches to one maintaining the right thought, whatever may be the crisis involved! Crises mark the history of the saints, and in every one something is stressed; and if one in any given place is true to the issue, victory will follow. Some may be lost, but there will be victory in the issue, if the truth involved is maintained; there is overcoming, there is victory, so that the history of crises is the history of victories for the saints, one after another. I suppose no annals in heaven are more interesting than the annals of the
{257}
victories of the saints. "Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory", @1 Corinthians 15:57. It is a characteristic thing attaching to those who love our Lord Jesus Christ. "This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?" @1 John 5:4,5. The annals of heaven afford no more interesting history than the victories of the saints, culminating in overcomers. The Lord presents Himself as an overcomer in the last address to the assemblies, that is, to Laodicea: "As I also overcame", He says, "and am set down with my Father in his throne", @Revelation 3:21. In other words, the whole dispensation is in that setting; it is in the setting of overcoming, first by Christ, and then by His own. The truth cannot be maintained otherwise. So that to the last assembly the Lord's word is that the overcomer is to sit down with Him in His throne. That is a future thing, but one to which every lover and friend of Christ is looking forward with the greatest satisfaction, for there is a link in it between the saints and Himself, the link of overcoming. Let no one allow the idea of overcoming to slip away from him; it may. It is the great thought at the end.
So the first and second visits to Egypt to Joseph are the crucial ones, and I hope the Lord will help everyone to hear, and help me to speak rightly on this point, because whatever may have been the antecedents in our histories, the idea now is to become really brethren, really so. Joseph's literal brethren had that status, of course, as the sons of his father, twelve brethren, sons of one father. This is what they assert, but the profession was void of the real thought in the ten, and it is so today, and it may be so with us even here to some extent. We want the real thing, dear brethren, and heaven is looking for the real thing, and all that the Lord is doing for us
{258}
is in order to attain to that in reality; and reality in this involves enrichment. That is how divine things are reached, not simply by light, but by enrichment in our souls. Heaven is full of riches; divine Persons there are infinitely so; and the intent of divine operations is to bring us into that, into conformity with heaven, not only in the way of light and intelligence, but in the way of riches.
So the brethren, Jacob's sons, in the first visit are treated hardly, they are treated roughly. You wonder at such a man as Joseph being capable of treating his brethren roughly, and the more do we wonder at the antitype, for, of course, it is not a question of Joseph, it is a question of Christ. Were we really to judge ourselves as to the antecedent history, we should have no just complaint as to the rough treatment; we can have no just complaint. It is the most salutary kind, the most needful kind, of treatment if we are to reach the divine end; for the Lord in dealing with us must be always dominant; He must have His own way. He has the means by Him of enforcing His own way. Let no one assume anything else! "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?" @1 Corinthians 10:22. Were Jacob's sons stronger than Joseph? No! He says, I am lord of all Egypt. He was a father to Pharaoh; and he treated them roughly. He is not going to tell them who he is on the first visit; it is a question of breaking down fleshly conditions -- that will which is, you know, capable of anything. The human will, even in a christian, is capable of the worst things; it is simply that, simply the human will. Then there is not only rough treatment, but imprisonment. You say, That is not christianity that you are talking about! It *is* christianity, it is the most salutary kind of christianity when will is at work. No one can deal with the human will but God; no one can really deal with it effectively but God, and He does it. Joseph
{259}
imprisoned the whole of them for three days, the ten of them. Think of how they must have looked at one another in that prison! In Jacob's house before they left they looked at one another.
There is a great deal of that, looking at one another; but how are we looking at one another? Are we clothing one another with divine thoughts? Do we see any loveliness in one another? If we do not, looking at one another only provokes ill feeling; that is what it does; and Jacob says, 'Why do ye look one upon another? Go down and get corn!' (@Genesis 42:1). Brethren who are stopping about, looking at one another, are not carrying on the work of God. Why should anyone shackled by his own will, hindered from the work of God, be looking at another? Now then, in the prison they have three days to look at one another as common prisoners. They would never forget those three days. No! Joseph knew that it was needed. Then he binds one of them before the eyes of the others. In all these cases there is someone that needs more severity than the others. There has never been a party yet without a leader, and the leader is the most responsible. Heaven hates parties, and has ways and means by which to break them up; and to break them up it will break up the leader. I am not saying Simeon was in any way worse than the others; Scripture does not say so; but anyhow he was not Reuben, and he was not Judah. Reuben and Judah would have saved Joseph at the outset. Nothing is said about Simeon in one of the blessings; he is left out altogether. Why should that be? But here he is bound before his brethren: what does that mean? It means that I need to be bound, too, as in the same cause, as in the same pernicious party; because there was murder behind it, there was nothing at all of brethren in it, not a whit, not an iota of family feeling in those men! The very anguish of soul they now speak of as having been in Joseph did
{260}
not touch their hearts. Simeon is bound before their eyes, and remains a prisoner till they have gone back and come down again.
But there is a second visit, dear brethren; let us not be content with the first, with the harsh treatment; though really Joseph made things harder for them on the second visit; but Joseph was made known to his brethren "the second time", as they came down from Canaan into Egypt for corn the second time. What a change now! They have the overcomer with them. As a rule if God is working with a party, a party against the truth, He is working with one person in it, never with the whole of it, never *en masse*. It is a feature of partyism to move *en masse*, but that is never so with God: He is against that. It is "the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart", @Zechariah 12:12,13. If I go out it is by the sheep gate, and I must come back by the dung gate, each one must do so; there is no other way. It is worthwhile to come back by the dung gate. We cannot afford to be outside, to be outside the precious family relationships which are God's thought for us, and which heaven recognises, and which heaven would bring us into in the reality of.
So in the second visit they bring Benjamin, the overcomer; that is to say, God is working with someone; and now when they come, Joseph's house comes into view. The family thought is coming into view. How different from the prison! Simeon is at once released and brought to them. I do not say he was bound all the time; I do not know; but now he is brought immediately they come down; for now it is not prison time, it is house time. You see, there is prison time, and there is house time; but the prison time is
{261}
necessary, if will is at work, if I am to reach the house period. What a great thing it is to be brought into Joseph's house; and there is a man there who speaks about God to these wayward brethren of Joseph. God has been merciful to you, he says, and *He* has made you rich. You see, now you are coming into a little riches. You will allow me just to turn to the passage; @Genesis 43:19: "And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house". You see, dear brethren, we are travelling on right lines if we have strayed from the thought, and if we have not strayed from the thought, but perhaps have not reached it, this is the way. This is the steward of the house; the steward of the house has authority, for the thought is authority. A man in authority is a great thing in these matters, someone who can speak with authority. So it says, "They came near ... and said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food; and it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand. And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks". @Genesis 43:19 - 22. That is good: they are rich men now. They sold their brother for a few pieces of silver which could not enrich them very much; but now they have found money in the mouth of their sacks, and they are not hiding it; they are honest men now so far. To the steward of the house they must make acknowledgement; and they do so. There is no hope without acknowledgement. Self-justification has no place at all here. Away with it! It is foreign here! It is the steward of the house of whom we are speaking -- really those who keep order, according to Canticles. Their business is to keep order. The steward's business is to look after the interests of Joseph's house; he has authority in the
{262}
house. These are honest men. What can we do with any who are not honest men? These are honest men; they have money in their sacks, and they could have kept it hidden, but they brought it back, and other money too. Their wealth here is in their honesty, not in their money; you may be sure of that, dear brethren! What is money in itself? Nothing! It is what lies behind the money, whether it be a love gift, or honesty, paying what I owe, it is what is behind the money that is of value; and so there is wealth here: they are honest men, becoming wealthy so. The steward says to them in verse 23, "Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks". @Genesis 43:23. Now, dear brethren, you see, God is giving them treasure. It is really a moral matter. It is a question of honesty, and being enriched. This is a very beautiful speech: "Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks": God has done that. How different that is, even if I might have been elevated through my own honesty, I am now elevated to the idea of God enriching me: God is doing it. However much I may claim to be one of the brethren of Christ, of what value is it if I am not rich on moral lines first, and then on divine lines, in that God enriches me, puts money in my sack? Let every young person, every young man and woman, test himself or herself as to this, whether they are becoming rich on these lines! How much deception there is! How much lying! How much hiding of things! We shall never become rich in divine wealth on those lines. The moral thing comes first, and then the divine enrichment. They are honest men now, you see, but God is making them rich. God has a great deal more than I have: He adds to what I have. Now I am on the line of being one of the brethren of Christ.
So the steward goes on to say: "I had your money". @Genesis 43:23. You see, it was in good hands. One always finds where
{263}
there has been disruption among the brethren that those not with God seek to vindicate themselves; they think the whole matter is in their hands; but it is not; it is in better hands. God looks after the matter. Let us leave it where it belongs. The steward says, "I had your money". They had it in their sacks, but now they have brought it back; he is testing them out. They are honest men, now becoming wealthy men by the blessing of God, on moral lines in themselves, but by the blessing of God. So he goes on to say: "I had your money". "And he brought Simeon out unto them", @Genesis 43:23 that brother who has been 'ill-treated', you know! It is wonderful how oratorical we are in setting out what we think is our ill-treatment! There is not a word about the ill-treatment which we meted out to Joseph, no! He brought Simeon out to them. They might say, What reason had he for imprisoning our brother? He had a reason; he knew better than they; he was dealing with them all. God has a wide outlook in what He is doing; He is dealing with each one of us in these issues. Every person in the place, indeed, the whole assembly, is supposed to get something out of it. The once imprisoned and bound Simeon is handed over by the steward of the house to his brethren with not a singe upon him; nothing at all has happened to him to damage him. He has been in good hands. If I am in prison on those lines, I am in good hands. There is not a word of self-vindication from Simeon, or from any of them. Here he is, handed back by the man who had the money, this trustworthy man, the steward of the house. Then we are told that the man brought the men into Joseph's house, the same man, the trustworthy steward of the house; he brought them into Joseph's house. Dear brethren, we are making headway: let us not keep ourselves out of this man's hands, this trustworthy man! His business is to look after Joseph's affairs; he is not Joseph, but Joseph's steward, the steward of his house. Let us trust him; let
{264}
us see what he will do for us! God has made you rich, he says, I had your money and now here is Simeon, and you can have your money.
Now he brings them into Joseph's house, the place of family distinction and affection. Let no one keep himself out of it! Let every one of us, dear brethren, get down to the bottom of the matter and see to it that our assumption to be brethren is really true, that it is so, that we are becoming rich on moral lines, and on divine lines, God adding to what we have. God is making you rich, says the steward of the house. God is making you really what a brother ought to be, a wealthy man according to God. Now they are brought into the house. What a difference between the house and the prison! They are brought into the house.
I cannot say much more on this line, but you all know the history, one of the best known histories, and yet one of the least known; but you know the letter of the scripture anyway. They are brought into the house, and Joseph came home at noon. That is, the Lord has other matters in hand, not only your local matters. He is not only occupied with what is local, but with what is universal. We think there is no other matter than our local matter. We are just living on our matter, as if there were not anything else to be concerned about, living on it -- and dying on it, that is the truth! But Joseph is a man of affairs; he came in at noon. The Lord Jesus, whom he typifies, has immense affairs. I love to think of the Lord Jesus in that sense. We are enjoined as to the Christ dwelling, through faith, in our hearts; that is, Christ viewed operatively. Well, Joseph came home at noon, and it was a fine time for the brethren. He set them all in their places -- it is still a tentative sort of thing -- Joseph by himself, and they by themselves, and the Egyptians by themselves; still, Benjamin, the loved one, the real brother
{265}
loved by Joseph, is sent five portions; discrimination is now coming into view; the overcomer is recognised; but, still, Joseph is to be made known to them all the second time. This is the second time; this is the testing time. "The second time Joseph was made known to his brethren".
I am not able to dwell on these details; I hasten on to chapter 45, a chapter well known to us. There is no room here for criticism and table talk about this thing and that thing that have happened. No, there is nothing like that now. Joseph and his brethren are together: every man has to go out. It must be a holy scene, Christ and His brethren. Think of that, dear brethren! But then it is the second time; it is the wealthy time, the time of the contrast to the prison, the time of the house, and the time of becoming wealthy. One could say much about Benjamin's sack, and how the one who is really loved is brought to light. Benjamin his brother is brought to light, and the brother is brought to light in Judah. Judah sets out the crucial side of the matter in chapter 44, that is to say, he is ready to place himself in his brother's stead, he is ready to lay down his life for his brother. There is never victory in these circumstances unless somebody is ready to die for the people. That is the idea: readiness to die for the brother, to die for the father, to die for the brethren; that is the true spirit. But Joseph has brought them to it. It is the wisdom of Christ typically, the harshness first, then the imprisonment, then the house, then the test of the cup (about which much could be said), then the true brother in Judah, who, we are told, prevailed among his brethren: he prevailed in love, dear brethren. In this way he is ready to be slain instead of his brother Benjamin, for the sake of his father, for the sake of love. Joseph says, That is the finish! Let us come to it: "We ought to lay down our lives for the brethren"! "Hereby we have known love"; @1 John 3:16.
{266}
it was never known before until Christ came; it was never understood before till Christ's death. "Hereby we have known love, because *he* has laid down his life for us; and *we* ought for the brethren to lay down our lives". @1 John 3:16. As soon as that happens the matter is settled: Joseph makes himself known to his brethren the second time: it is a great victory, the whole twelve together on each other's necks! What a difference from biting and devouring one another, self-vindication, pretension to this thing and the other thing! Instead of all that, laying down our lives for the brethren, which is the solution of the whole matter, one man dying for the people. Then there is the other thing, that here and now the Lord is ready to recognise us. If people call us brethren, the Lord says, So do I! We find we are brethren. The Lord says, That is right: that applies. Gideon says to the kings of Midian: "What sort of men were they that ye slew at Tabor?" @Judges 8:18. It reminds one of the question as to the Lord Himself: What sort of Man is this? It is a question of kind. Well, they say, Every one of them was like you, every one of them was like the sons of a king; and Gideon said, They were my brethren. The Lord owns that. Let us take it to heart. Is there anyone here, dear brethren, who has failed of this thought, and is asserting himself? Can the Lord own me as one of His brethren? I cannot afford to be indifferent to that: I must be sure of it, and the test of it is laying down one's life for one's brethren. Every one of them, say the kings of Midian to Gideon, is like you, like the sons of a king. "They were ... the sons of my mother", @Judges 8:19 says Gideon, alluding to the influence of the saints, viewed as the assembly, in this matter, "the sons of my mother", bringing out, by the by, what an ideal his mother had, a greater ideal actually than the husband. She must have had God before her soul, for these were her sons.
{267}
Well, the other thought is in @Acts 7, "The family of Joseph became known to Pharaoh". This is a sort of general thought which is seen in @Genesis 45, how the tidings came to Pharaoh and his house that Joseph's brethren were come; but this is not enough for Joseph. Joseph would say, Well, Pharaoh has heard about my brethren, but then, I want him to get to know them really. The Lord is not ashamed to call us His brethren, and He wants others to know it: but then He says, It must be a matter of quality; it must be a matter of selection. It is not every one who is called a brother who is presented. Joseph selected five, we are told, from the whole number of his brethren. Every brother is put to the test. Joseph passes by this one, and that one, and the other one, and selects five men out of the whole number to present to Pharaoh. In other words we are now coming to a more crucial matter, to a matter of selection. We are altogether too optional in our outlook, assuming all is well, that we are all brethren. Let us never forget the principle of selection, one of the great principles laid down from eternity in heaven. So here the whole number comes under review. Am I to be among them? Am I to be passed by? -- not rejected from the family, but not fit to be presented to Pharaoh. Joseph would have Pharaoh know his brethren really, what they really are. He would make selection -- we do not know the names -- of five out of the whole number. There are those who quarrel with selection: we hear of it constantly in regard to matters amongst us; but selection is a great principle with God from before time. Every one of us owes his christianity to selection: "Whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son", @Romans 8:29. It is a question of selection, and there is no thought that one cherishes more than that, that it is entirely a question of divine, sovereign selection. But here it
{268}
is more than that, it is a matter of concrete qualities, and I have been speaking of these qualities, dear brethren; and presently the Lord will give us to understand that He is making a selection from the whole number of His brethren. It is from the whole number of Joseph's brethren: they have all come under Joseph's eye for selection, for presentation. Can I afford to be out of it? No! I cannot afford to be out of it. If I am a true man, I will seek to be one of the five. The Lord will not pass me by. It is the principle I am speaking of. He has His own measurement, His own standard. He is going to make the presentation an orderly matter. It is a great occasion. Are there five of whom Joseph will not be ashamed before Pharaoh? He is seeing to that. Will he bring the whole eleven in? He might, but he is taking five. He is not going to be ashamed of his own selection. No! He is too skilled in qualities, as we learn in the parables in the New Testament. What a connoisseur of qualities the Lord is! He is too skilled to select anything that would be a discredit to Him.
Well, having said all that, I come back to my text in @Acts 16 just to bring it all into a local position. We have often commented on this chapter: it has a great place in the gospel testimony, particularly as introducing not only the gospel, but the work of God which is greater really as a continued thing than the gospel; it is the work of God introduced into Europe. So, as I said, the apostle is released from prison. He had been in prison himself as a martyr, not to self-will, but to the truth, a great thing, dear brethren. Many are martyrs to self-will, but he is a martyr to the truth, and so is Silas. They are released from prison, and they go to Lydia. Think of these great men, the greatest men under the eye of heaven at the moment down here. Pardon me for making such bold statements, but I cannot refrain, for we do well
{269}
to make much of such men as these; heaven does it. Think of the places these men will have! They were amongst the greatest men in the service for the moment -- certainly Paul was. He goes *to Lydia* when released, and then he sees the brethren. It seems to be the first thought -- as to the brethren, I mean, as mentioned. He is about to leave; and this is always a matter to be thought of in crises, that the Lord comes in and helps us, but He leaves us. He leads us to a point, and then He leaves us, as it were, to see what we may do. He leaves us with the brethren; they are the ones who hold the ground. We do not know that there were many brethren there. As far as the outstanding facts go there were but two households secured by the gospel; but the word 'brethren' must not be omitted from Philippi though there be but a few. The households are the background of the brethren. The authorised version renders it: "They ... entered into the house of Lydia", but it should read: "They came to Lydia"; it is the person who is in view. Who is she? She is an overcomer; she stands in the foundation of the city, in the foundation of the meeting in the city, in the assembly there. How did she become that? Well, the record tells us that she attended to the things spoken by Paul. The foundation is there, the foundation of the apostles and prophets in Europe is there. Never was a soul more likely than this sister in Philippi to be foundational in a place, save Peter perhaps. Paul would say, She is the one! for her heart was opened to attend to the things spoken by Paul, particular things. Let us not forget, dear brethren, that there are particular things. Peter calls them "the present truth". @2 Peter 1:12. Lydia would say, 'The present truth to me is what Paul is teaching: that is the point with me'. And the Lord made it a point with her; He opened her heart that it should be so, and it was so. Paul goes there. It was a question of Paul's
{270}
teaching, and that is fundamental; you can trust what is there. Then he sees *the brethren;* he exhorts the brethren. Can we say Lydia is left out? No, she is among the brethren unquestionably; but it is "the brethren", those who are left; he went away, having exhorted them.
May I conclude with what I began with, namely, this city, and the brethren here? Writing to the Hebrews the apostle begs them to suffer the word of exhortation, "For", he says, "it is but in few words that I have written to you" @Hebrews 13:22. Suffer the word of exhortation! Those local here know what they need to be exhorted about better than I do; the Lord knows too; but the point is this -- the brethren, the brethren in this town where the idea was well-nigh lost; it is to stand in its brilliancy. Let every brother and sister in this town understand: the idea of the brethren is to stand in its lustre, maintained in its qualities, and to have place until the end.
{271}
*Pages 271 - 412 -- 'Households in Relation to the Ark' and Other Ministry, 1938 - 39, (Volume 209, first half)*.
HOUSEHOLDS IN RELATION TO THE ARK
@2 Samuel 6:3 - 11,20 - 23
The Lord seems to be stressing in the ministry that we have from time to time the believer's household; and in one meeting after another, through one speaker after another, this subject is put forward; and it would appear that the saints are absorbing the truth. In view of this, and in spite of it, I have ventured to read these verses, knowing that I am in the current for the moment. To keep in the current is an important matter in serving the saints, the current in which God is manifestly making Himself felt. It makes it somewhat easier in ministry to take up what is thus already on the mind of the brethren; the ground is already covered. And yet, however much may be said on a specific line of truth, if the Spirit is operating we never seem to exhaust it; there is no such thought as exhausting divine subjects.
They are in infinite relations. The Holy Spirit has set them in the Scriptures for us; the whole field is studded with subjects for ministry. And what was written aforetime was by holy men of old being moved by the Holy Spirit, no scripture of itself being of any private interpretation; it is one great whole standing in infinite relations and the more you touch it in any given part the more you are made to feel that it is infinite. God is the Source. It stands in relation to God, not only as He is supremely above, but in the Spirit. The Spirit down here maintains everything livingly and in infinite relations.
{272}
You will pardon my making these remarks in a preparatory way. We feel we are in waters to swim in in dealing with the things of God in this light. I have selected this chapter because it contains the household in a threefold way, the believer's household. Abinadab's is the first household mentioned. His household is mentioned at a much earlier date, in @1 Samuel 7. It is mentioned there as on the hill, evidently a household of some distinction in its day. It is introduced thus as distinguished from other houses; it was upon the hill.
The ark of God having just returned from Philistine territory and custody, indeed captivity, I should say, is brought to this house on the hill. As the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim took the ark and brought it up this hill, we can understand that they thought they were doing something above the ordinary. I suppose with every sect in christendom -- and there are a great many -- in its inception the leaders of them always assume they are doing something out of the ordinary. The formation of sects in christendom is an interesting study; each would take on this character, these features of being distinguished and of being out of the ordinary.
Abinadab is not said to have been a Levite; he did not have that distinction; and if one takes on something for which he is not divinely qualified, then you may be sure that he will lose what distinction he seemed to have, because the work of God is to be performed by qualified persons; God is extremely particular.
The ark was there for twenty years, we are told first of all. Some spiritual person according to the first book expressed feelingly that it was a long time that the ark was in this household. Why should that be said? Did the ark have to suffer? Were the circumstances unsuitable? Why should the time be considered long? But twenty years is only a fraction
{273}
of the time of the ark's sojourn in Abinadab's house; it remained there until this particular period of which I have read, which probably would be sixty years or more. If it were long at the end of twenty years, it was certainly more than long at the end of sixty or seventy or whatever time it might be. Why would it be considered long? Why should there be such a lament? Well, dear brethren, not to enlarge on this point, my answer is that the facts given indicate that the place was not just suitable for the ark, on the hill though it were, elevated, as you might say, in seclusion and exclusion, too; we may be sure there would be a certain amount of care of the precious ark of God; notwithstanding all this, there is not the slightest suggestion that Abinadab got any spiritual help from the presence of the ark. It is not that he sought it; it is not that he valued the privilege of having it in his house; the people of Kirjath-jearim put it there, and they sanctified his son, called Eleazar, to look after it. There is no evidence that either Abinadab or his sons were Levites. If the father was not, the son was not.
Now, dear brethren, you may wonder why I am leading you up to this point. It is that I may have in my house the ark in the sense of which I am speaking of it, the idea of sanctification or setting apart one of my sons to look after it or even putting the burden on myself, and yet I may have never accepted definitely in my soul what was suitable for that ark. I have never set to work to provide what was suitable. I may have had children and grandchildren in the house, and not one of them has come to the true idea of the ark or what was fitting to it. So that after all these years we have two of his sons and a new cart and the ark on it. There is not a bit of progress in that house. There is, in fact, the clear evidence that in that house, both in the head of it and in the children,
{274}
there never had been a true idea of the ark or what was fitting to it. Well, we may say, he certainly served; and I am not denying that there was some service there; but let us examine the facts that the Spirit of God gives us and we shall see that during all that time the divine eye had to look on that ark, the precious ark, that type of Jesus, in that house in which there was not proper care for it. It was, in a word, an improvised condition of things; it was not the divine provision, it was a human provision to meet an emergency; and yet in all these years there was no profit, no instruction imbibed, no inquiry as to the mind of God about such a matter.
A spiritual man alive some forty years or more afterwards, says, "We heard of it". He says, "I will not give sleep to mine eyes, slumber to mine eyelids, until I find out a place for Jehovah, habitations for the Mighty One of Jacob", @Psalm 132:4,5. Think of the difference between David, coming in so many years afterwards, and Abinadab! Let us suppose that David and Abinadab met together and had a conversation about the matter, Abinadab would be much older, looking upon David as a young brother and saying, 'Well, I have had the ark here a great many years; I know far more about it than you do'. Old brothers are apt to speak that way. But let us look at the facts. David says, 'Who is your father? Who is your grandfather?' Well, he is of the house of Judah; evidently so. David says, 'Did you ever read the book of Numbers?' Abinadab says, 'Well, I have got the Bible in my house; yes; I have got the ark, too'. The ark and the Bible ought to go together; your relations with the ark ought to be determined by the Bible, and by the Bible properly read. Everything in your house and all your relations with the ark should be determined by the teaching of the Spirit of God from the Bible.
{275}
Well, Abinadab must say it is not so; and David says, 'It is not so. And I can tell you more, Abinadab; I have had sleepless nights about that ark being in your house, and it is because it has not got proper care. I am thinking about getting a place suitable for it'. If I am professedly entertaining the ark, that is, what relates to the testimony of God in my house, what about the conditions there; what about myself? Am I a Levite? Am I a Kohathite? Am I a priest to God? That is the challenge. David says, 'I have not seen it. I know of that lack of these things in your house. You have got the ark there, that priceless treasure; and I have got sleepless nights about it, because it is not properly cared for'. That is the first point I make. Here is a young man coming in forty or fifty years after the history given in @1 Samuel 7, and he says, 'I have got sleepless nights about this thing'. I wonder how many young people in fellowship there are here who have got sleepless nights about the conditions amongst us. These are the exercises God is looking for. He will not fail to come in for us to rectify conditions that need rectification if we have got sleepless night; and not only sleepless nights, but prayerful nights. "I will not give sleep to mine eyes, slumber to mine eyelids, until I find out a place for Jehovah, habitations for the Mighty One of Jacob". @Psalm 132:4,5. And moreover he says, "We heard of it". @Psalm 132:6. He would say to Abinadab, 'I heard about this. I know what is going on in your house on the hill. You have got card parties, and yet you have the ark there'. I am not whipping anybody here, you understand; but I wish to bring before us what is contained in this chapter. What conditions existed in that house and yet the ark was there! There was not a bit of instruction either in Abinadab or his grandsons. They are very likely his grandsons; the earlier one was Eleazar who was sanctified to look
{276}
after the ark. David says, 'I heard about it'. "Behold, we heard of it at Ephratah, we found it in the fields of the wood", @Psalm 132:6. David says, 'I have had sleepless nights about this thing, and I have prayed to God about it'. That is the position.
Abinadab would be challenged. He would say if he were an honest man -- and I have no doubt he was -- 'Well, my young brother, I admit it. I have respect for the ark; I admit what you say'. Hence the necessity for a David, the necessity for a Solomon. That is the appeal of the Lord here tonight; He wants Davids and Solomons, and Samuels, too; those who will care with genuine feeling for the ark of God; that is to say, the great symbol of the testimony, whatever it be today.
And so, David in his psalm goes on to speak about priests. "Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness" @Psalm 132:9. As much as to say, they are not in Abinadab's house on the hill, but they exist. It is not only that they exist, but let them be clothed with righteousness. And so @Psalm 132 shows how God took account of the sleepless nights and of the prayers of David, and brought the ark back to Zion.
These two grandsons of Abinadab, Uzzah and Ahio, Eleazar is not mentioned, are both driving the cart; and there is not a single voice lifted against it in all that multitude, the army of David, thirty thousand men. I must come now to speak a word against David himself. I have put into his mouth the words that would indicate that he should not have allowed this cart, but he did. It does not say that he provided the cart, but it does say that the cart was there and was driven by those two sons, or grandsons, of Abinadab; and David says not a word about it. It is a negative matter now. We are not told that David formally provided the cart, but there is nothing said to indicate that he condemned it. There it was, as if all were well. The meetings
{277}
go on as usual: we have a good reading, a good meeting for prayer; they go on as usual, but presently something happens. What happened here? Well, the oxen stumbled, and the ark was in danger. Well, you say, there is not much in that; it is not to be wondered at that oxen stumble, and that the ark might be in danger on a cart. It was a new cart, I admit; no doubt the wheels were properly made; but the ark shook, and Uzzah put forth his hand and touched it. You say that was quite all right. Well, you see, what you say under those circumstances is just what God is dealing with. God says, It is *not* all right. We have to judge by what God does. Something happens; that something, as I said, is Uzzah's act, and God strikes him dead. We have to go by what God does in the matter. To judge this incident by ordinary religious sentiment, you would say, That is too severe. Oh yes, that is very common; we are dealing with matters superficially, whereas God is dealing with the matter as it is in His eyes. I have no doubt this man Uzzah was a good brother. It is remarkable that the Spirit of God does not make any condemnatory remarks about Abinadab or say any praiseworthy things. It is for us to see; the thing to go by is what God does; that is the thing to go by.
This terrible thing happens; well now, the next thing is that David is indignant. What has happened to him? Where is @Psalm 132? Why is he not awake about this ark now? He is indignant about God! And so, we are told, he just turned the ark aside; as much as to say, it is a secondary matter. He carried it aside; the straight way is to Jerusalem; he carried it aside; it is in abeyance. You cannot get the blessing in Jerusalem or in David's house under those circumstances. God is thinking about that ark that David just turned aside and put in there in Obed-Edom's house. Who Obed-Edom was, we are
{278}
not told; there is not a word said in his favour or against him. What God does brings out who he is. If I bring in the gospel of John I would say, Come and see.
There is the ark carried aside by David; he has gone on to Jerusalem to marshal his army and carry on his affairs, but there is the ark carried aside. How about it, dear brethren? The ark stands for everything that is for God down here. It is carried aside there into that house. We are not told that Obed-Edom was a Levite. Why should David not enquire? Is he a Levite or a priest? Not a word. It is the silence God is dealing with. It is what is *not* said, and what is *not* done, and what is *not* enquired into that is the point. God is cognisant of all that, and it is what *He* does. Who is this man Obed-Edom? He must be a Philistine. Do not be too sure about that, because the word 'Gittite' might mean something different from what you think it means.
The ark is carried aside, that is the next thing. John says, Come and see. There are many who condemn the saints of God in their meetings; talk about their miserableness and narrowness, their small meetings and the absence of what is attractive naturally. You get a lot of that. Come to Obed-Edom's house. Never mind if he is a Gittite; come and see. What will you see? God is blessing that man and everything he has got; that is wonderful. Never mind who he is, or what he is; you go into that man's house. David carried the ark in there; it was a secondary matter; he was in no state to deal with the ark. He turns it in there. It was there only three months. It had been for years on the hill, and there had been no gain at all, no blessing at all; but now in three months the blessing has started. Come and see. Do not stay away and criticise. Come to the meetings and see whether there is anything for your soul, whether there is any evidence of the
{279}
blessing of God amongst them. If there be that, woe be to you if you are criticising them! Come and see, says John; that is the point. Many a soul has got blessing by coming and seeing what God is doing, however small and insignificant it may be.
"Jehovah blessed Obed-Edom and all his household". There was one man in the realm who went and saw. He heard and believed. David had got light in the meantime; that is the thing. Let us look into matters, Why is it? David did. He tells us elsewhere, 'We did not bring that ark from Abinadab's house according to the prescribed order'. He had been reading the Bible. What do the Scriptures say? Let us have recourse to the Scriptures. David says, 'The Levites should have borne that ark. Obed-Edom has been blessed of God and I am missing it'. David could not afford to miss the blessing of God, and neither can we. He went down, but he does not make such a show as he did before. We do not need armed men to bring up the ark. What we need are priests to bring the ark up. There was one house in the realm of Israel that was being blessed, and if there is one house, I want to be the owner of that house; I want to be the head of that house that God is blessing. It did not take years to bring out that the blessing of God was there; it was there immediately. In three months, there it was, flourishing; however many sons or grandsons he had, they were all flourishing in the blessing of God. There are many of us here I know well that are not blessed of God. We belong to the house of christians, but the blessing of God has not yet extended to us. "Jehovah blessed Obed-Edom and all his household". I suppose the youngest babe in the house came in for that blessing. His whole house was blessed; all that he had was blessed of God; there is no question about it. Do not tell me anything about Obed-Edom or where he came from David says, 'I
{280}
want to be like that man. I want to have the ark in my house. I am going to have it there; and I am going to have it in suitable conditions and with suitable attendants'. And he does; he carries it all out.
Well, now I come on to David; he profits by all this. There is nothing said about Obed-Edom's exercises. I do not want you to think too much of Obed-Edom; it is a question of what God does. There is not a word given about what kind of man he was, not even if he were a Levite or not. The point is this: God is blessing him because the ark is in his house. That ark must have been properly attended to or God would not be blessing the man. That is the way to arrive at the truth, what God is doing. Surely God is to be the Leader; if God is blessing a man, who am I to traduce him? David heard that God was blessing that house and he would have the ark with him in Jerusalem.
I pass over the beautiful account that we have of David playing before the Lord. Some of you think the brethren are very dull, not much in the meetings. That spells what you are, what your apprehension of things is. The Spirit of God uses the word 'play' here, and the word 'dance'. He presents to us a mighty king clothed in a linen ephod dancing with all his might before Jehovah. We are going to get something in this man's house. The idea of the house is accumulation. Abinadab has missed it; Obed-Edom has found it. David says, 'I am going to find it, and I am going to be the head of my house. I am not going to parade the fact alone that God is blessing my house; I want to represent God in my house'. Let every brother who has a house understand this: that you are a head, and as head to your house you represent God, nothing less. David understood it. He called God Himself Head later.
Well now, David is a humble man in the presence of God. He is not arrayed in military attire as some
{281}
leading men would be in such circumstances; it is a priestly garb; it is a question of spirituality. For I cannot play before God save as a priest; I cannot dance before God save as a priest. Now he is coming back to bless his house. There is not a word about Obed-Edom's blessing his house; God did that. But now the head of the house is doing it; he is a representative of God, he is rising. You can see how the household principle develops in this remarkable chapter.
But there is a wife there, and she is despising this head of the house; her name is Michal. She has got a reputation; she is known over all Israel. She once was a lover of David; she saved his life once, but now she is despising David. God hates a wife who despises her husband, and He hates more a wife who is not in subjection to her husband, and speaks ill of her husband. See the ridicule, see the disdain in that naughty woman's mouth; see what she says here: "How honourable did the king of Israel make himself today, who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the lewd fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!" Think of the temerity of a woman saying those things! The king of Israel, the representative of God, raised up of God, is dancing before God as priest and here is a naughty woman speaking about her husband in this unpardonable way! Is she going to pass? No! She is not going to escape the just judgment of God; her line is going to die out; it is going to become extinct. Such a generation as that is an abomination in the things of God. She is the daughter of Saul; she is a woman governed by the natural despising the spiritual. She is not going to escape. David says, "It was before Jehovah". How beautiful! He knew how to speak about Jehovah. 'It was before Jehovah, Michal. Jehovah has no place in your mind at all; you are the daughter of Saul, and Saul was
{282}
always a persecutor of me, and you are doing the same thing. You are despising me'. That is what was in David's mind; it was before the Lord. David is head of his house; he is not going to brook this; he is proving that he is head. God has made him head. He says, 'I am going to bless my house and you are not going to come into this blessing; your line will be extinct'.
That is about all I had to say. David's speech here is very remarkable. He says, "It was before Jehovah, who chose me rather than thy father, and than all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of Jehovah, over Israel; and I played before Jehovah. And I will make myself yet more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight; and of the handmaids that thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour. And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death". I think this is very fine for every head of a house; 'I am not going to be turned aside by this attitude; God has blessed me here'. That is virtually what David says. He says, 'I am going through with it, and there are going to be results'. "I ... will be base in mine own sight"; that means, I am going to be more spiritual than ever; you are despising me, but others will not. It is a moral victory in the house.
David represents a christian learning and learning, until he reaches a point where he represents God in his house. The book of 1 Chronicles shows that he proceeded on this line, and ultimately says to God, 'You are Head'. God did not say, 'You have failed in it'. No. David maintained his place in his house as head and God supported him. And so in the end he is able to stand on his feet as an old man and speak to God as Head. He, as the king, also receives homage. They "did homage to Jehovah and the king" (@1 Chronicles 29:20), showing how he progressed in his soul. In that chapter he speaks of
{283}
the affection he had for the house of God; and the people did homage to him thus; he has progressed in his soul. They reverenced the king as well as Jehovah. I only speak of that to show how the head stands the ground, and refuses to be turned aside by any despiser in his house. He stands firm by the principles and God stands by him. May God grant it so increasingly, for His name's sake!
{284}
"DIFFICULT TIMES"
@2 Timothy 3:1 - 17; @Daniel 9:25; @Acts 16:25, 29 - 32
I wish to speak of difficult or perilous times, as spoken of in the first scripture read. These times have arrived. It says in the New Translation, "Difficult times shall be there" (verse 1), meaning that they shall be manifestly present at a given time. Prophetic announcements involve at some time or another their fulfilment. Fulfilment of a prophetic announcement is very real when it comes about, and so the word here is, "shall be there". We may say now, They are here. They are marked by conditions in the world that are in great measure the occasion of the difficulty. Within living memory, of some of us at least, general economic, business, and domestic conditions have taken on extraordinary changes and have occasioned, and do occasion, largely what is referred to here. The word here means 'difficult' rather than 'perilous'. Christians in employment in the world are exposed to demands upon them that they cannot conscientiously comply with. Conditions have arisen through the wise of this world scheming as to how to fortify men and women against conditions from which they suffer, by such things as trade unionism and insurance, different societies and associations too, other than trade unionism. These largely enter into the make-up of the difficult times that are not *to be* but *are* now, and are increasing.
Instruction as to how these difficult conditions or times are to be met is obviously of the greatest importance; and God has provided us with this instruction, which calls for uprightness and integrity in His people; for aside from uprightness and integrity, spiritual instruction cannot avail of much. Integrity is essential in dealing with the public situation at the
{285}
present time. These difficult times are not peculiar to any country. They are now universal, for innovations such as I have referred to are spread abroad from christian lands into heathen lands; christians are beset with them wherever they go. Young people do well to face the matter and see whether the way is possible, for there is a way. God has foreseen conditions; they have not taken Him by surprise, nor is He legislating in view of them now. He has provided what is needed in the way of instruction, and He would have us to be learners so that we may find the way through with a good conscience; that is, not only a *good* conscience but a conscience enlightened by the truth and maintained good by one's attitude and conduct; for a bad conscience means a weak christian. He must keep on the breastplate of righteousness, or he will fall down under the onslaughts of the enemy.
Now this chapter in 2 Timothy is devoted to this subject, and I read it because of that and to point out the divisions of the chapter. Attention is called to the evil difficulties of the moment, the concrete effects of the evil that is at work; for evil underlies the difficult times in which the enemy has his part, but in which leading men of this world have their part, too. First, attention is called to the generality of the people and what marks them in the list of things given. "For men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, evil speakers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, profane, without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, of unsubdued passions, savage, having no love for what is good, traitors, headlong, of vain pretensions, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God; having a form of piety but denying the power of it" (verses 2 - 5). That is a generality and includes old and young; not necessarily the leaders yet but the generality of the people; and obviously a list is given so that the
{286}
saints will not be in that list. We have a list of our own, and what is especially to be noted is what men *love*. First, they love self. They are marked by self-love, which is very common amongst young people, evidenced in the use of the mirror and the brush and other such things. And then, as you will observe, "lovers of money", another feature that strikingly marks young people; not to hoard it, but because of what it brings. Money as it comes into the hands of young people usually leaves them quickly because of what it brings; they are not hoarders. And then we find that there are those who are not lovers of what is good. I am calling attention to the use of the word 'love', not only as to persons but as to *things*. There are those who are not lovers of good. And then we have lovers of pleasure and non-lovers of God. So we have quite a list of persons and things coming under this word 'love', either in the positive or the negative sense; particularly the last reference, "lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God". This is the list the Spirit of God gives immediately in calling attention to the difficult times that come and that we have to meet with day in and day out in our affairs, and the list is given obviously that each christian should challenge himself so that he should not be in this list.
And then, secondly, in this list or classification of people, we have leading men. "For of these are they who are getting into houses, and leading captive silly women, laden with sins, led by various lusts, always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth" (verses 6,7). And we complete the type of the opposition with, "Now in the same manner in which Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, thus these also withstand the truth" (verse 8). These are of the class, I think, already called into account. They would be outstanding persons of this class. They resist the truth by imitation. That is number two;
{287}
the second feature of the difficult times is that in this class of people we have outstanding ones who resist the truth according to a very old model, an Egyptian model; showing that whilst modernism enters keenly into the constitution of the difficult times, old or ancient evils find a counterpart in this condition. Jannes and Jambres are not found by name before this. We are not told earlier of them by name, and that in itself is a significant matter because when we have names they are apt to be fixed more in our minds, and we are to find them in their own place. In the Old Testament, they are found in the book of Exodus; not by name, but by their character. The Spirit of God is pleased to give us their names now, for surely He would remind us of the cumulative character of sin and that men did learn to sin in ancient times as they have learned to sin now. There are, as I said before, innovations; but at the same time sin is lawlessness. One of the definitions of it in Scripture is 'lawlessness'; not as in the Authorised Version, "transgression of the law"; it is *lawlessness*. That is what sin is, and these two men were outstanding sinners of that kind because they had to do with the power of God in Moses and Aaron in a most striking manner, and they resisted it. They resisted it in the most lawless way by imitation, for it was manifestly the power of God, and they sought to set it aside by imitation.
The next thing is the remedy, how to meet all this, and that is the first thing that the apostle would bring forward after having said, "But they shall not advance farther" (verse 9). It is a most comforting word that great as their power is and intensive as their operations are, there is a point beyond which they cannot go: "but they shall not advance farther". It is not by an act of arbitrary power on God's side, but by exposure. They are exposed, dear brethren. "For their folly shall be completely manifest to all, as that of those also became".
{288}
The exposure in Egypt was effective. It was manifest that they acted under the enemy's power. They were controlled and energised by Satan in opposition to what God was doing by those two great servants in Egypt, that is, Moses and Aaron. Their folly was manifest to all, the apostle says of Jannes and Jambres. Everyone here would say, I should like to be in that; I should like to have to do with that which exposed this imitation. Well, it is not simply a matter of special ability. Every upright christian, every christian of integrity, is called into this service to expose imitation; that is, if I am real, I expose imitation, hence the importance of reality. The reality of the power operating under Moses and Aaron exposed the imitation under Jannes and Jambres, and so today. Only reality will expose imitation, hence the call for genuineness in us, for reality in us.
And then, as I said, there is the remedy. The apostle says, "But *thou* hast been thoroughly acquainted with my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, long suffering, love, endurance, persecutions, sufferings: what sufferings happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what persecutions I endured; and the Lord delivered me out of all" (verses 10,11). We may not see all of this, but there is something of it. If God has not raised up personality amongst us, there are no models; but if God has raised up personality after Christ, there are models among us to some extent. Paul calls attention to himself, not that he had any pleasure in it, not that he wished to bring himself forward. It is the Spirit of God. There is no one more suitable to bring forward as a model in his day than himself; and hence he is brought forward and to the young man to whom he is now writing about this. And so I would appeal to the young here: Keep your eyes on the man of God, that is, in whatever measure there are men of God. As a matter of
{289}
fact, Timothy is the only man in the New Testament called a "man of God", a very striking thing; hence, it is within the range of every young man and young woman here. He was a *young* man, and he is called "man of God". He was himself a model. The apostle Paul himself sent him to Corinth to be a model, but here Paul is calling attention to himself. Timothy, he says, You know me. It is an immense advantage that there was such a man as Paul in Timothy's day, and Timothy availed himself of the advantage. That is the point, dear brethren, especially as to the young people. Avail yourself of whatever there is; if God has put any man of God near you, pay attention to him. Notice him. Not that I would make any partisan feeling or set anyone up as a perfect model -- not at all! But this idea of a model is one of the leading things in Scripture, and Paul brings himself forward here and uses a list of things as over against the list I have spoken of in the early part of the chapter.
And then he says further to him what one is to do. "But *thou*, abide in those things which thou hast learned, and of which thou hast been fully persuaded, knowing of whom thou hast learned them; and that from a child thou hast known the sacred letters, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation" (verses 14,15). What a word that is to all young people here! Pardon me for referring to young people, but there are parents here sitting by, as it should be in meetings like this; the children and parents are to be together as much as possible. And the parents know as they are sitting there what these young ones need. "From a child" -- think of that! One loves to see the children sitting around in these meetings. "From a child thou hast known the sacred letters". We learn earlier that faith had come through his grandmother and his mother. You must not forget the grandmothers and grandfathers, and we must
{290}
pay attention to fathers and mothers; but now it is the child *himself* and that he himself (his parents are not mentioned here) from a child knew the Holy Scriptures. What a burden on parents to keep the Holy Scriptures before their children, especially in the morning readings! One has been impressed with the need for these readings because it is a frontal attack, and the attack is on the mind of the youth. How are we to meet it? We can only meet it by the instruction of the Scriptures, the children knowing them as children and growing up in them. They are there all the time, morning after morning, not simply in the Scriptures themselves but in the home character of the teaching, family teaching, where all can join in and where the Holy Spirit loves to enlarge on the truth so that the youths might imbibe it and develop in it. So this is how the matter is to be met positively. "From a child thou hast known the sacred letters, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation, through faith which is in Christ Jesus. Every scripture is divinely inspired, and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may be complete, fully fitted to every good work" (verses 15 - 17). It is something about the character of the Holy Scriptures themselves, for as children read the Scriptures morning by morning, they are to understand that every Scripture is inspired of God. It is not as some infidels would say, or some modernists, that some scriptures are inspired and some are not. The word 'scripture' alludes primarily to what is inspired. There are none uninspired, and the children are to understand it, and to stand up in their classes even, to do with the enemy's opposition, that the Scriptures are inspired of God, and there is the proof of that that they are profitable. Furnish a book that is as profitable as Scripture! There is none. The first book of the Bible, the book of Genesis, is profitable, whatever
{291}
they say. It is profitable for doctrine, as Paul says here, "For teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness". There is the positive evidence of the power of Scripture that it is profitable. There is no book like it. There are imitations, the Apocrypha, which has been added to both the Old and the New Testaments, but it is not profitable. It may contain certain historical things, but the Scriptures are profitable for all these things, for promoting what is of God in men and women. That is the idea. Well, now that is all I had to say. The man of God is referred to that he may be perfect, whoever he is. Timothy is the only one in the New Testament called "man of God", not that there were no others. There were hundreds of them, but here is a young man called a "man of God", as much as to say, It is within the range of all young men and young women. "That the man of God may be complete, fully fitted to every good work". So that the refutation of the imitation that there is in Jannes and Jambres, comes out in the reality of christians, in men and women, in every one of integrity, reality, and transparency. "That the man of God may be complete, fully fitted to every good work".
Well now, I go on to Daniel to show how building follows on this. All I had in mind in reading the verse read was the last clause -- "The street and the moat shall be built again, even in troublous times". I appeal not now to the very young but to those who are active in service; not indeed, that every one is not to be a builder, for love builds up, we are told; that is, love will do something in the way of building. But this remarkable vision or prophecy is really an answer to a man praying. It is one of the most remarkable prophecies that you can get, and it is such a prophecy that is within the range of everybody who prays. Daniel gets this word from God through Gabriel because he prayed. He tells us,
{292}
"And whilst I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before Jehovah my God for the holy mountain of my God; whilst I was yet speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, flying swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation. And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, Daniel, I am now come forth to make thee skilful of understanding. At the beginning of thy supplications the word went forth, and I am come to declare it; for thou art one greatly beloved. Therefore consider the word, and have understanding in the vision" @Daniel 9:20 - 23. Now that is remarkable. It is while he was praying. While telling us that he prayed and confessed, he returns to the thought of praying. "Whilst I was yet speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel ... touched me". @Daniel 9:21. That is one of the most encouraging things that I know of as to prayer, what may come to a man who is addicted to praying more and more. And so in our private prayers, we should not be too short. In our public prayers, be short; I would say that, but in our private prayers, you may go on all night; the Lord did, and we may be sure something will happen from God's side; God loves to listen. His ears are open to our prayers. He loves to listen, but He is not quiescent always in listening and something happens, and I want to get into it. Indeed, one can speak a little about it, and I see it here in Daniel, "Whilst I was yet speaking in prayer". @Daniel 9:20. It was while he was speaking to God, that Gabriel came to him. Gabriel may be said to be *our* angel. Michael seems to be Israel's prince. Gabriel is the priestly angel. Michael is a military angel, and so we have Gabriel in the New Testament also in relation to prayer. He stood at the right of the altar of incense at the hour of prayer, so he is the angel to keep in mind. He is a representative of God but at the same time he says
{293}
here that you are remembered and greatly beloved. Think of being told that from God, from the messenger of God who comes all that way to tell a praying man that he is a beloved man, that he is well-known in heaven, and that they think well of him up there. What a thought that is! And then as regards what Daniel wanted to know, he says, 'I have come to give you understanding; not only to tell you the bare facts, but to give you understanding as to what is to be'. "Seventy weeks are apportioned out upon thy people and upon thy holy city ...". @Daniel 9:24. And now he says in verse 25, "The street and the moat shall be built again, even in troublous times".
That is why I read that passage, because God is looking for building, and I might say what I said earlier as to general instruction: however much I may receive in the way of instruction, there will be no building until I am established, for the work of the ministry is with a view to the "edifying of the body of Christ" (the word 'edify' is the same as 'build'), "until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ", @Ephesians 4:12,13. If the enemy cannot hinder us in our Bible readings or the light coming to us, he will certainly hinder us on the line of building. He will say, 'I cannot hinder a good meeting, but I certainly can hinder that young brother or sister in the business place or at home. I can keep them from the building side. I will keep them from that side of things. If building goes on, they will get beyond my reach'. Men and women do. Believers get beyond the power of Satan. "I have written to you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one", @1 John 2:14. What a great thing it is when a man has power over the devil. He understands how to deal with him. Resist
{294}
him, it says, and he will flee from you. A man understands that, and so the building goes on. I get built up in my soul in the office. My superior may be unfair to me, and that is the devil. The devil would hinder the building by unfairness from my superior, but the man in me enables me to go on nevertheless. You say, That is the devil. As soon as you can name the thing and overcome it in a sense, the building goes on. John says to the young men, "Ye have overcome the wicked one". @1 John 2:14. I know full well there are other things that come in, but you have overcome the devil. But then there is the world; you are not to love the world. A young man wants to get on in business, have a better house, a better car, and all that sort of thing. That is the world. "Love not the world, nor the things in the world. If anyone love the world, the love of the Father is not in him; because all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world", @1 John 2:15,16. That is a further thought for the young men, but I am speaking now of the building and how a man who has overcome the devil can go on building, edifying himself, "building up yourselves", @Jude 20 it says. We are to edify one another, of course, but one edifies oneself in reading and meditation and prayer. He edifies himself, growing by the true knowledge of God.
Well now, in the vision here, Gabriel tells Daniel that there is to be building in difficult times, troublous times. We have this street and wall, as we get it here in the Authorised Version. The Spirit of God seems to use two words that are in mind in the prophetic eye. They are not those ordinarily found in history as under Nehemiah and in other building times. It is a street and a moat. The word 'moat' seems to be the better word, according to Mr. Darby. Others say that it is difficult to know what the word means.
{295}
That is what scholars say. I am only telling you what I have learned from others, but whatever it is, it is something to build; and there is something that we may not have yet named that has to be built. If it has to be built, then build it. Do not let the devil hinder you from building it. That is the idea. Nehemiah gives us an example of how he built. He built a wall. He does not tell us about the street, but the street is very important in the things of God. We know that well. It is important in the heavenly city. We know that it is important as a sphere of public testimony, and, may I add, in preaching the gospel. We commonly say, preaching the gospel in the street -- a fine word that is. Well, here they were building a street and a moat, whatever it was, or a rampart, it was something protective that was needed against the enemy. If we do not see to it, the enemy will get in. Make sure of that! You say, I do not know what that word means. Well, never mind; whatever is to be built, whatever means an access for the enemy to come in, build against that. See to that. These were troublous times. Nehemiah gives us an illustration of how troublous the times were. Chapter 3 tells us about them. It is a remarkable account of the building of the wall. He tells us about Tobijah and another man saying, This business will not do. You see the enemy does not like the building. It shuts him out. It is closing up avenues through which he might attack us; whatever they are, name them. If you will name them, you will see that the thing has to be met, or the enemy will get a footing amongst us. So Nehemiah tells us in chapter 4, "And it came to pass that when Sanballat heard that we built the wall, he was angry and very indignant, and mocked the Jews. And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? shall they be permitted to go on? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, when they are burned?" @Nehemiah 4:1,2.
{296}
This is a combination with the army of Samaria. They would combine, this man Sanballat and Tobijah the Ammonite, and the army of Samaria. That is the opposition. That is what we have to contend with. The enemy is working through these instrumentalities, and he is against the building. That is the point. "When Sanballat heard that we built". @Nehemiah 4:1. It is against the building.
Well now, dear brethren, I cannot enlarge on this, but just to show you how in Nehemiah's time, we have illustrated troublous times. You see the trouble that arose from these men, Sanballat, Tobijah, and the other contenders, to set aside what Nehemiah and the Jews were doing, and their work was to despise. 'What wretched stuff this is. These poor Jews; if a fox went up, it would break down their stone wall!' Is that not irony? Well, Nehemiah prayed. He was a praying man, too, and the building went on. You say, I cannot go on with all this trouble; but then Nehemiah says, We did. Look what he says further down. "And I said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and extended, and we are scattered upon the wall ... in what place ye hear the sound of the trumpet, thither shall ye assemble to us; our God will fight for us. And we laboured in the work; and half of them held the spears from the rising of the dawn till the stars appeared" @Nehemiah 4:19 - 21. What energy! Dear brethren, this very chapter is written for us as we are here tonight, to make us builders and make us continual builders, in spite of the opposition and in spite of the troublous times. That is all I have to say on these chapters.
And now I want to say a few words on @Acts 16, a well-known passage, but what I want to point out is that in the most difficult times conceivable, the
{297}
service of God went on in Paul and Silas. Let each of us think of the difficulties that existed, as mentioned in these verses. They were cast into the inner prison with their feet fast in the stocks and their backs smarting from the scourges, and yet they carried on the service of God. It says, "And at midnight Paul and Silas, in praying, were praising God with singing, and the prisoners listened to them" (verse 25). You say, There are only two of them; but if there were two hundred of them there, it would be the same thing. They carried on the service of God. That is the point. They carried on the prayer, and out of the prayer came praises unto God. You see the prison resounded with their melodies, their spiritual melodies that went up to heaven. They did, beloved. Did God not think this was His service? It was as if He would say, They have been heard in heaven today, and the service of God has begun in Philippi; and you know it continued. The gospel went on, too, in the same place in perilous times, in most difficult times. They preached the gospel, and a beautiful gospel, too. "Believe on the Lord Jesus ...". How delightful those words were to heaven. 'Lord Jesus *Christ'* seems not to have been in the original words of Paul and Silas. Here it seems more an affectionate than an official thought. The *Lord Jesus Christ* would carry the official thought, but these men are affected, all their feelings are in the matter. All their feelings were in the song of praise and prayers, and now their feelings have to do with this poor man, this hardened sinner that needs a Saviour, and he knows it. Their very hearts and beings went out to him. They are evangelical in the extreme. It is a gospel meeting of the highest order. "Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house". I know of no sentence just like it in the gospel. It is the first time we have the salvation of the house expressly mentioned in the
{298}
gospel. "Thou" twice, and that man is so in our minds; he must be saved and his house. Let nobody say, The circumstances are difficult for the meetings, for the praise of God or for the gospel, in the presence of these scriptures. And thirdly, there is what we may say is the Bible reading too in verse 32. It cannot be denied it was a question of the Scriptures, the word of God which they spoke unto him. They had sung, they had prayed, they had preached, and now they speak to this man. You have the whole service of God carried on and gone into in that prison in Philippi in the most difficult circumstances, so let no one complain about the smallness of meetings and the difficulties of the moment. Let us go on and meet the difficult times with the provision God has made for us, and we shall find a way through and we shall have victory and there will be results.
{299}
BALANCE IN GOVERNMENT
@Genesis 1:26,27; @Exodus 1:20 - 22; @Exodus 2:1 - 9; @Revelation 12:1 - 6,13 - 17
The connection between these scriptures will, I hope, be clearer to us all as we proceed to look into them. What is in view is the re-establishment of the agency of government in its proper equilibrium, for the verses read in @Genesis 1 show that the woman was included in the government -- "Let them have dominion", it says. The word 'man' includes both the man and the woman; one word is used for man denoting what he is made of, the other, the next one used, denoting his place in the divine economy as a being. Woman is included in both; she, as the sequel shows, formed that part of the being or race which is peculiarly amenable to adverse influence. It is no question of discrediting the female sex, but of how God was pleased to *make* man, for that is the first word used, and then to *create* him. He was pleased to create him in that form, "male and female created he them", which did not apply to any other order of being in the universe at that time, as far as we know. God is pleased to create man that way. One feature amenable peculiarly to influence, that influence should have emanated from the stronger side of the being or race, but as the sequel shows, it was an adverse influence, and that has run on ever since; it is the weak side in man, any one of us viewed as a man or a male.
In Pilate's case, for instance, he maintained in measure what is proper to man in the execution of his governorship, for Matthew stresses that side in him; he was called "Pilate, the governor". @Matthew 27:2. Viewed abstractly as Pilate the governor, he saw no flaw in Jesus, nor would he have put Him to death, he would
{300}
have delivered Him. But the side in him amenable to adverse influence soon showed itself, for God reminded him very strikingly that the female side, the proper equilibrium of government, was right, maintaining her place. Pilate himself showed the feminine weakness, that which is in the race peculiarly exposed to adverse influence. His wife was right, she maintained the man's side, the masculine; that is the side of government. She sent a word to her husband at the critical moment when the manhood that was proper to the moment should have stood out in him -- but he failed. "Have thou nothing to do with that righteous man; for I have suffered today many things in a dream because of him", @Matthew 27:19. A remarkable fact! So that the governmental ability was there which should have warned Pilate and strengthened his hands in his own judgment. His own judgment was right viewed abstractly, but this mean, weak, contemptible side showed itself; although he argued his case in favour of Jesus, of righteous government, he succumbed to the false reasoning of the enemy and delivered over a righteous man to be put to death. I mention all that, dear brethren, to show what is in mind tonight, and how God would warn us by the history of Pilate as governor not to be like him. Each one is in a position of a governor, first as to himself; "he that ruleth his spirit" is better "than he that taketh a city". @Proverbs 16:32. A man may be very able in warfare against others, but fail in ruling his own spirit. It is as that masculine side so essential amongst the brethren in judgment, in rule, in care, is maintained today, that the weak side so readily influenced by false accusations or statements or petty feelings will be ruled out. We should be woman-like, or men in the feminine sense as Pilate's wife in a critical moment, "Have thou nothing to do with that righteous man". @Matthew 27:19. A message like that is often needed in our so-called meetings for care, a better word than
{301}
'rule', it takes precedence of the word 'rule', for it is a shepherdly thought. If a man does not rule his house, how shall he have care of the assembly? The principle of rule must be there, or our meetings for care must fall short of righteous judgment. Not Christ Himself personally, but something of Him may be handed over to the enemy through influence. It may be by the Jew, by the legal element amongst us, or by some other influence, and the judgment miscarries. "Have thou nothing to do with that righteous man; for I have suffered today many things in a dream because of him". @Matthew 27:19. How wholesome that would be if the dear sisters did suffer in regard to these problems and carry them in a suffering way! The enemy would be shut out. Let the brothers be notified by their godly wives as to these matters. Pilate's wife spoke of Christ to her husband as a "righteous man", and said that she had suffered on account of Him. God will respect our sufferings in regard of these problems that have to be faced and dealt with. One sees them constantly in local gatherings, wrong judgments reached, or failure to reach right judgments. We fail to reach a judgment and let it rest, and the weak side of us is there exposed to influence.
Well now, you will see the drift of what I have in mind, and the right thing is to be presently carried out through a woman, seen in @Revelation 12. She bears the marks of the governmental dealings of God, early succumbing to false influence, she is suffering in pain in God's governmental dealings, but she has gained; she is not listening to Satan now. I will show that in a moment. I want to show, before going to Revelation, in the book of Exodus, how the prince of this world is aiming at the male side. The Lord said, "For the ruler of the world comes, and in me he has nothing", @John 14:30. He had nothing in Christ; the fulness of manhood was there, Satan had
{302}
nothing there. Never could he weaken Christ, there was no weak side there. You understand that the types are full of instruction. The birth of a male caused but half as much time of uncleanness as that of a female child; it is to bring out this principle that I have a weak side in me. God is taking notice of it, and is pointing out that it means weakness and sin coming in. Whereas if the male side is maintained, there is so much gained, half the suffering, half the time to suffer under the government of God. And so the prince of this world, Satan, instinctively understood this. He considered Adam and Eve as they were created. You may be sure he spent time in considering these two persons, these two beings. They were new to him. He said to Jehovah later as regards Job, I have considered him. "Jehovah said to Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job?". @Job 1:8. He says, I have. What did Satan discover in him? He considers every one of us. And in the care meeting he will act upon you according to your propensities that he has observed. If you are a brother amenable to influence, personal influence, personal feeling, he will work on that.
So the king of Egypt directed that every male should be cast into the river to get rid of that element, but every female was to be saved alive. What did it matter to him whether the female child was saved? It *did* matter, for that element would build up his world. The so-called church has become part of the world. Why? Because that element has been saved, carefully won over by the worldly governors of the assembly in the early days. The emperor would say, I want conditions such as I can influence, all other elements cast into the river, put out of the way. Well, we do not want that in our ruling in the assembly, dear brethren. We want to save the male. I will show in a moment from Revelation how intensified the male thought is in this child who is to be
{303}
born, how carefully he is watched over and caught up into heaven too. Pharaoh has all the people of Israel in his realm, and he has got power to cast the male into the river and to save the female alive. It is a part of his system. That element in man as a characteristic is available to Satan; it will build up this world, adorn this world, that is, as I am amenable to his influence.
Well now, having made those remarks about Exodus, I want to show you how God came in; and the object of this meeting is that God may come in, because these conditions are prevalent. It is pitiable to see how brethren contend over what is not right. Others are suffering because of it. What they wished preserved, others are suffering that it might be dealt with, and what is needed is for God to come in and to turn these very elements that Satan is using into an element, a masculine element, as it were, that will act for God. The wonderful thing is that all the agencies in this chapter are feminine, all the divine agencies are feminine; I mean in the first chapter and the early part of the second. I am not including the father of Moses; he is, of course, to be included, but he is not mentioned here as looking after the child; it is the mother. The New Testament credits him with seeing what is in the child. The Spirit of God draws a picture here and it is the mother who is prominent. God is acting against the prince of this world, and that is what is needed, dear brethren, where wrong judgments are reached or where right judgments are not reached. Will God come in and will He change conditions, will He turn the very elements that Satan is preserving for his use into instrumentalities for God? Will God do that? He does that constantly. He does not always give account of His matters. We do not know the history of Pilate's wife, but it would look very much as though God had to say to that
{304}
woman, formed her in secret, and when the momentous crisis was on, she was ready to act in it sufferingly. That is what is needed. If we suffer for a thing, we are right in it, and God will support us and use us against the evil. So what you find is two midwives. You wonder how it was that Pharaoh knew these women, just ordinary nurses, but we have to understand Scripture spiritually. These women are God's servants. Pharaoh is saying, 'Save all the female children alive'. Does he see that these women are used of God? Why save all the female children alive if God may use them, as He does? He is using them here. So the midwives are outstanding in this matter. We have their names given. I suppose they are registered in heaven. I suppose we shall see them in that day; I should like to see them. They were saviours of the race, the saviours of mankind on the male side; they have a great place. There were two of them, and God dealt kindly with them. I am speaking in the most practical way, dear brethren, that this matter of the salvation of what can be trusted, what is recognised of God, what is created of God for government, should be preserved. Persons who not only care, but rule their own houses and rule themselves in truth. The epistle to the Romans reaches this point, it makes men out of us, that is the idea. As the apostle says, "Quit yourselves like men", @1 Corinthians 16:13. Conditions at Corinth were feminine in the sense in which I am speaking of it; they were exposed to the devil. Paul says, "For I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ. But I fear lest by any means, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craft, so your thoughts should be corrupted from simplicity as to the Christ", @2 Corinthians 11:2,3. This is the battle that is going on all the time. So God gets the victory in Exodus. It is very striking: it is a question of exodus, of our going out of the world, and whether there is
{305}
the element, as we go out, of the salvation of what will rule, what will preserve what is right, what will act for God. We are going into the wilderness; the governmental hand of God is to be amongst us. That is the position in Exodus. So God deals kindly and well with these two women and makes them houses. I suppose there were no such houses in Egypt as those two houses; each of these women was to have a house divinely made. Is there not something to indicate the assembly? What a wonderful kind of architecture would be in those houses! How repelling of everything Egyptian! They are God-made, and the furnishings are suitable for the saviours of the race, for the preservation of what is needed for God.
Then we have others in the next chapter. We have Moses¬ mother, that is number three, and Moses¬ sister, number four, and Pharaoh's daughter, number five; five women acting for God in the presence of the prince of this world, saving men alive. What irony there is in it! As if God were to say, 'If you destroy the men, then I will use the women, I will have such as are suitable for the preservation of what is of Me, like Pilate's wife'. Well now, the moral is that one as a christian has learned Romans, has arrived at his individuality, in saying, "So then *I myself* with the mind serve God's law". @Romans 7:25. You are secured for God, that is the principle, you are no longer in flesh. The apostle sees that his flesh is amenable to the work of the devil. We are no longer in that, and therefore we come to what is needed in the service of God, in the government of the assembly. Here is a man who stands on his own feet and says, I am determined that with my mind I will serve God's law. I will not listen in the care meeting to personal feelings, I will rule them out, I will stop my ears and rebuke those who bring them in. I will stand by the law of God. It is not simply the ten commandments; in @Romans 7 it is God's law, whatever
{306}
it be of God that governs this case I stand by that and repudiate all else. I am no longer in flesh, in that which can be influenced by personal feeling. Personal feeling is most damaging and the root of all divisions amongst us. It is not simply that I am contending for the right, I am contending against a brother. That is all. There is so much of that, dear brethren. If I arrive at @Romans 7, I am in principle beyond that. "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law"; @Romans 7:25 whatever it be I will stand by that. God has reached that in Exodus. I believe it is morally the ground of Exodus, that you can go out into the wilderness in this. God was turning what was amenable to Pharaoh against Pharaoh. It is the converse, taking us out of the flesh and putting us in the Spirit where we serve God's law. The ark was brought in later. It was not made in Egypt. God's law was being served in these two women; His rights were being preserved. It is in the wilderness that you have the ark; that means Christ having the law in His heart; He magnified it and made it honourable. That is the principle that is governing these women and preserving what is of God. God is honouring them, and now it is perfectly seen in Christ, in the ark. All that is in the mind of God is seen in Christ. Adam was a figure of Him that was to come, so that the two midwives, and the mother and sister of Moses, and Pharaoh's daughter, five of them, are the saviours of Moses, saviours of what God needs in His government here below, wrested out of the hands of the devil, the prince of this world, and used by God in the preservation of what is of Him, worthy to be preserved, for Moses was a proper child, fair to God. How sorrowful it is where even a babe as Moses becomes a victim of personal feeling, or any such feeling, in the judgment reached in our care meetings! So the apostle says, "Quit yourselves like men; be strong". @1 Corinthians 16:13.
{307}
I want to show how perfectly it is carried out in Revelation. Revelation is a book of results. What worked out from the outset in the garden of Eden is seen in its results, for good or for evil, in the book of Revelation. So we find the heavenly city coming down from God out of heaven, having the glory of God; that is what man is, he is God's glory. That is the masculine side. Although retaining her own place, the feminine side, she has got that, the glory of God, she has got the twelve apostles of the Lamb, government, the twelve tribes of the children of Israel, government, and the angels, again government (@Revelation 21:10 - 14). In that way, she embodies the divine thought in government and yet retains the proper equilibrium of the female side. She is thoroughly balanced. Many a brother is right in the abstract, but gives way to personal feeling, and goes against his better judgment, as Pilate did. The equilibrium is what is needed, Pilate's wife was that, but Pilate failed in not listening to it. So we find this woman in @Revelation 12. She is clothed with the sun. Think of that beautiful mark, the symbol of government! And the moon is under her feet, and she is crowned with twelve stars. How beautiful is the picture! It is the complete reversal of @Genesis 3, save that the sign of the government of God is there in her pain. Doubtless it is there to remind us that God has used His government to reverse the disaster of @Genesis 3. God turns to account His governmental dealings with us, where we fail, to bring us round to His thought. He has put the thing prominently there. This woman is where she is "clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars", in the humble recognition of the government of God; it helped her. Satan is against this again, he is not now the prince of this world. It is very stimulating to see the degradation of Satan. He began as a serpent, the most degraded
{308}
animal. God made him that, and dust his meat. Through falsehood and brazenness he attains the position of government. Now he is degraded, he is a dragon, he is waiting to devour the male child. It is the same thing as Pharaoh again. I am endeavouring to make a present application. Satan is watching every one of us, and knows what we are amenable to. Is that brother ready to listen to an evil tale, a false story, and to be influenced by it, or some other personal consideration? That is what Satan is watching for.
Now here is a man child. Look at the beautiful clothing, the attire of this woman! Nevertheless, the sign of the government of God, through all the centuries it has come down. She is crying in pain, but see how she is robed! It is worth while. She is clothed with the sun, and the moon is under her feet, and she has a crown of twelve stars. It is worth while to go through and endure the government of God and what it entails if that is to be the result, dear brethren. So the devil knows. Why did he not devour *her*? He is waiting to devour the child, because it is a male child that is going to be brought forth. A remarkable expression! "She brought forth a male son". Why is the word 'male' added? It is to intensify the thought. God says, I am reaching infinitely My thought in this Child. Satan knew it, knew something of it, and he is ready to devour the Child. The names he gets are degrading: he is called "a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his head seven diadems; and his tail draws the third part of the stars of the heaven; and he cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bring forth, in order that when she brought forth he might devour her child" (verses 3,4). That is to say, making the thing applicable, whatever the conception of what is right, Satan would destroy it at the very beginning, would not let
{309}
it develop. Whereas God is bent on the development of this masculine side, so that His interests should be preserved, right judgments reached, and the interests of God in that way preserved. Before we get the picture finished we have, as I said, the serpent: to identify this being that is described here under the heading of the dragon, he is said to be the serpent (verses 14,15). And later, "He laid hold of the dragon, the ancient serpent who is the devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand years" @Revelation 20:2. There is no mistake about it; whatever his appearance is, that is what he is, "the ancient serpent" who acted on that which was amenable to his influence. Pilate was influenced by the Jews and he went so far as to scourge and hand over to His enemies "that righteous man"; @Matthew 27:19 that is what influence will do. His better judgment justified Jesus. So in our manhood let us stand by our better judgment and refuse the evil influence. So, as I said, Satan is bent on that, to destroy this male Child; so it says, "And she brought forth a male son, who shall shepherd all the nations with an iron rod; and her child was caught up to God and to his throne" (verse 5), and He is there now. Satan is bent on destroying the male side, as I have been describing it, and here it is, as I might say, infinitely provided in a male Son. You might say, Tautology. Never mind, the Spirit of God can bear that. He is stressing the idea that God began with, that Adam was not in the transgression -- the man viewed abstractly is out of it -- it was the woman who was in the transgression, and she brought him into it. If I apply that to men, it is amenability in my flesh to come under the influence of the devil. Whereas as reaching my personality in @Romans 7, "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law". @Romans 7:25. I stand by that, and my salvation is in that, and refusing the condition of the flesh, so that the male son is born, and God says to Satan virtually, This is to be preserved, and He is caught
{310}
immediately up to God and to His throne, but He is to rule the nations with a rod of iron, "who shall shepherd all the nations with an iron rod". What a beautiful touch that is in contrast with what is now before our eyes in the nations. It is rule in Christ, and it takes the form of shepherding. There is no compromise, of course, because it is a rod of iron. There can be no compromise when it is a question of God and His rights, but tenderness and patience in regard of the person; that is shepherd care. God has that Man away from the serpent, away from the dragon, He is caught up. It is a question of preservation, of being taken out of the way. God is going to work out something in the meanwhile, and that is in this woman, this mother. Is she going to hold her ground? Christ has gone, the male son is born and gone up; she remains here; is she going to fall under the influence of the serpent again? No! No! She fled into the wilderness to get out of his way.
I give advice to every young person here, keep out of the way of the devil. You say, I want to see a little bit of the world; why should I not? You are putting yourself in the mouth of the dragon. This woman does not do that. Eve listened to the dragon, but this woman does not. This woman is keeping out of his way; she goes into the wilderness, out of his way. "And the serpent cast out of his mouth behind the woman water as a river, that he might make her be as one carried away by a river". But then we are told earlier that she gets wings as of a great eagle. One says, I cannot stand the influence of this world; you do not know what I have to stand in the office, in the workshop, in the school. Well, this woman had to stand the terrible opposition of the dragon, but she kept out of his way and is keeping out of his way. We are told that she has got the wings of the great eagle, the wings by which *God* carried His people out of Egypt are in her possession,
{311}
so she flies out of his way. That is the best advice I can give to young people, do not put yourself in the way of evil; keep out of the way of the dragon; and again it says, "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you". @James 4:7. God has given you power in that way. And then the dragon makes war with the remnant of her seed. Will they give way? No, they keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus. There is the man and the woman, "male and female created he them", and "let them have dominion". They have it today in Christ and the assembly, and they will have it in the coming age. The assembly is still retaining the feminine side; she has got all the features of the masculine in the names on the gates. That is the point I believe God is insisting on now. Government must go on; let these petty things go, judge them, they are just appealing to that side of me that Satan can influence. Maintain the man's side and God's interests will be cared for, rule will continue. May God bless these words to us.
{312}
LOCAL POSITION OF THE TESTIMONY MERGING INTO THE GENERAL
@Luke 4:16 - 32; @John 6:59 - 65; @John 7:2 - 14
J.T. These scriptures may help us to gather up the truth as to the local position of the testimony, merging into the general position, specially with regard to the ministry at Nazareth, the local position, the place to which the Lord belonged, then at Capernaum where He dwelt, and finally at Jerusalem which would represent the general or public position of the testimony, where He taught in the temple.
This well-known passage in Luke furnishes facts that bear on these remarks and support them. The Lord was already serving; verse 15 tells us He taught in their synagogues; attention is thus called to Him as the *Teacher*, then He came to Nazareth where He was brought up. In service we are peculiarly tested in relation to the place where we are brought up; then again, one brought up in a locality is taken up by God to represent Him in some way in the place, to bring in divine thoughts there, and to bring them in according to God, in a suitable way, so as to draw forth as far as possible the approval of the people in the place, not to antagonise them. If the *truth* does that, we have to leave it, but the vessel is to enhance the truth in the town or city.
The thought is not to bring out the truth in a general way from these passages, but to show how God would cause His light to shine in any town or city, and the responsibility of those whom He may use to adorn or enhance it, not to discredit it. If there is hardness of heart we learn what may be looked for.
Rem. Does Luke particularly bring out the thought of commending the truth, the kind of
{313}
ministry which would appeal to the brethren, while with John there is what is authoritative as to Christ and His glory, and which would produce opposition?
J.T. Well, this passage in Luke brings in opposition, too, in a striking way, affecting not so much the disciples but people generally in the town, whereas in @John 6 the disciples are affected, they murmur. I think we see by comparison that the truth was deeper and fuller at Capernaum and the disciples say, "This word is hard; who can hear it?"
A.J.G. Does the anointing play a great part in the commendation of the truth?
J.T. That is the thought presented in Luke, not in John, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me". A ministry in public calls for the anointing; whereas according to John's standpoint, the *Person* is in view, who He is. We have to keep these two lines in mind. There is the anointing for service, ensuring that the testimony comes into a town in a dignified way.
P.L. "What manner of entering in we had unto you". @1 Thessalonians 1:9
J.T. The Spirit of God says of Paul in Thessalonica that "he went in among them", @Acts 17:2. He did not hold himself apart in any clerical way, but was as one of themselves there. The "manner of our entering in" would be in keeping with that. "On three sabbaths reasoned with them from the scriptures, opening and laying down that the Christ must have suffered ...". @Acts 17:2,3. It shows how calculating the minister is to be. The results carry the assembly forward in the place. All is carried on by the apostle in the assemblies afterwards according to the Lord's manner in @Luke 4 in Nazareth. The Lord would bring out the thought of how one is in the place where he is brought up, how He can take such an one and bring His testimony in through him, so as to assure the inhabitants that He is thinking of them
{314}
and would thus honour them indeed, but not to make them local, though they remained local in @Luke 4 after the Lord had spoken to them. The truth of God, whilst recognising our bringing up and our histories, would steadily lead us out of all that into the general position of our calling. Hence the "assembly of Thessalonians": @1 Thessalonians 1:1, @2 Thessalonians 2:1 they were *called* Thessalonians, the Galatians were *called* Galatians, but the calling of God would take us out of all that.
P.H.H. Would you say a little more about the thought of where we have been brought up?
J.T. The Lord is known here, known in the place. He knew those whom He addressed after He had spoken; it says He knew their thoughts: they were Nazarenes like Himself. He was called a Nazarene; they were the same, the inhabitants of the same town, so that the Lord knew their thoughts. They say, 'Do here what you did in Capernaum, add to our town' -- but God meets that with this beautiful presentation of the truth in that town. The Lord had spoken in many towns, but the Spirit of God does not tell us so much about any town as about Nazareth, simply to bring this out, how God would have us adorn the truth in that place.
Rem. According to John, Nazareth is discredited, "Can any good come out of Nazareth?" @John 1:46.
J.T. God's view of a town is different from man's view. Nathaniel would never say that again. God's thoughts are not as our thoughts. If a place is under reproach it is all the more necessary that the truth should be brought out by one brought up there. God would have us adorn the truth in our own place and adorn it in the home setting, too.
Rem. It is necessary for us to fill our place in our own locality before we can move out further.
J.T. Yes. One is to be known as 'one in the place'; you are commendable there. Paul says, "Certain also of your own poets have said ...", @Acts 17:28 and we
{315}
should be people like that, people that God can refer to: one of your own has said it, he spoke the truth well.
E.G. Does this come out in @Titus 2: in all their behaviour and relationships they may adorn the doctrine?
J.T. Just so, every one of us, even the slave, can do that.
Ques. Does this section stand in relation to teaching rather than preaching?
J.T. Both, but particularly teaching. First, how one is in a town according to God: God can refer to him. In the day of judgment God will refer to these matters; whether it be Nazareth, Capernaum or Jerusalem, God will bring up all these matters, how things have been said and by whom they have been said. In the day of judgment it will be more tolerable for Sodom than for Capernaum.
Rem. Is Epaphras referred to in Colossians in this way: "One of you"? @Colossians 4:12. Had he the necessary qualifications?
J.T. A very good example.
P.H.H. Would Samson be an example of what you are saying? It says, "The child grew, and Jehovah blessed him. And the Spirit of Jehovah began to move him at Mahaneh-Dan, between Zoreah and Eshtaol", @Judges 13:24,25 his own locality. Does that bear on our bringing up in a locality?
J.T. It does indeed. Timothy too had a good testimony among the brethren. As a child he knew the Holy Scriptures; he followed the faith of his mother and grandmother. It was a great matter for the town that he was there; he carried on what his mother and grandmother had, and could give effect to it, fitted by the knowledge of the Scriptures. Hence the importance of households having family readings with the children, so that they develop into vessels in a position where God can use them as
{316}
adorning what they have heard and learned -- gift usually comes in on those lines.
Rem. The Lord went down with His parents and was subject to them in chapter 2.
J.T. Yes, He went down to this very place. Now all this is coming out in a Person and in His ministry.
A.J.G. Is the testimony effective, not only by what is read and said, but by the whole demeanour and actions of the person? The Spirit of God engages us with every detail as to the Lord here: His standing up, unrolling the book, and so on, and the eyes of all in the synagogue being fastened on Him.
J.T. That is what I was thinking. How beautiful the whole picture is! One can visualise it. The synagogue would be a suggestion of the local gathering. At Nazareth they had the idea presented to them in perfection, how things were to be done, how the Scriptures were to be read: the Lord stood up to do it. In our Bible readings the reading of the scripture is not a mere formal thing, the Scripture ought to be read with unction by one who has known it from a child, one who values it and reads with feeling and power. In some gatherings quite young brothers are allowed, or asked, to read, but the question is, do they read it according to the pattern? What a moment this was! He stood up *to read*, entering into the synagogue to do so according to His custom; that it was His custom ought to be noticed: What was in His mind was *to read*.
Rem. We get the thought in Nehemiah: they read in the law of God distinctly and gave the sense (@Nehemiah 8:8).
J.T. The man read to be heard, he was on a pulpit of wood for that purpose, and there were persons there with him to support him. Stress is laid on the occasion, it was a public occasion; the second day was not that; and much is made of how things were
{317}
done, and how the sense of the Scriptures was conveyed. Ezra read himself and others joined with him, making the occasion a profitable one, leading up to another occasion which was on a higher level spiritually.
Rem. Our gatherings need to be invested with this kind of dignity; apart from this there is not adequate testimony.
J.T. So attention is called to the reading, the ear has to be attentive to the reading -- the Lord stood up to read Himself. "And having rolled up the book ... he sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed upon him". There was something there that would never be forgotten by anyone who had divine sensibilities, not simply because of who was reading, but *how* it was read; all that entered into the occasion.
A.B. The force of the scripture would be impressed by the spiritual touch in the reading.
P.H.H. The thought of the scribe and of the priest is combined in Ezra. Are you suggesting that this spiritual feature should be with us in connection with reading?
J.T. The priest's *lips* keep knowledge, whether it is speaking or reading, not his *mind* merely; though knowledge enters into his way of doing things. Divine sensibilities in the one who reads miss nothing of what is in the scripture.
Rem. In Matthew it says He went up into a mountain and sat down and opened His mouth and taught them.
J.T. Peter too alludes to his own mouth -- "The nations by my mouth should hear the word of the glad tidings", @Acts 15:7. The anointing attaches to the mouth.
A.B. Preceding public speaking, Ezra had directed his heart to seek the law of Jehovah and to do it (@Ezra 7:10).
{318}
J.T. And we have his genealogy; it is traced right back.
Rem. Household reading is very important. Complaints are made that children do not get what they want in our readings.
J.T. It would be very much more honest if parents challenged their hearts as to how they had taught their children. The Lord at twelve years old understood. He is the pattern. Fathers and mothers very often leave everything to the meeting with regard to their children.
Rem. Exodus shows how the foundations are laid in the household, a Iamb for a house.
C.H. The local setting is emphasised in that the people say, "Is not this the son of Joseph?" They knew all about Him, His sisters and parents.
J.T. That is the point. They noticed this. Then they go on to say, "Physician, heal thyself; whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country". If that is the kind of result from the teaching there is really no effect; they are only thinking of their locality. These general meetings are apt to become merely local occasions and what there is in them for the assembly in a general way is hardly thought of. The Lord's remarks would deliver us from that. If we have a great occasion in London it is not to add to London or to anyone there. The Lord may have to say to us as to what we are thinking about in our big meetings: they say, "Whatsoever ... has taken place in Capernaum". Why did they not say they were thankful for what He had done in Capernaum? It is their own country that is in their minds. The Lord would say to them, 'That is not the thought at all'. God was honouring them by presenting such a testimony to them, but the Lord brings in what had happened of old in the days of Elijah and Elisha, and thus exposed what was in their hearts, undue local feelings. They were
{319}
enraged -- He was cutting across their feelings and their desires.
P.H.H. Does that mean that, while allowing fully for the local setting, you would always have in mind the general position, what relates to a wider sphere?
J.T. If the occasion has not contributed to the general state of the assembly it has been a failure.
P.H.H. In Corinthians Paul says, "*We* have no such custom, nor the assemblies of God". @1 Corinthians 11:16.
J.T. That is the idea. What is ministered in any place ought to help generally and those in the place should not think of themselves in the thing, but the whole assembly.
Ques. Does @Ephesians 4 give the right outlook -- "Until we all arrive ..."? The Lord is on high and has given gifts for "the edifying of the body of Christ, until we all arrive ..." @Ephesians 4:12,13.
J.T. We see how God acts sovereignly. If we make things too local He will move out. They were all filled with rage, ignoring entirely how they had admired Him, and showing how local they were. "Rising up they cast him forth ... but *he* ... descended to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbaths. And they were astonished at his doctrine, for his word was with authority". Evidently they were going to get more here. The Lord is leaving one city where He has been persecuted and going to another, and John opens up to us something of the results. Matthew says that the Lord left Nazareth and dwelt in Capernaum. He had a house there. It is not now the Babe, nor the Boy brought up, but One who lives there, One who may be seen in the streets every day, He is known. He *descended* to Capernaum, a six hundred feet drop; it would not be a comfortable place to dwell, I suppose. If I move my dwelling, is it for my own convenience or for the testimony's sake?
{320}
If for the testimony's sake, it will probably be to my own disadvantage materially.
P.H.H. The Lord says, "*Thou*, Capernaum, who hast been raised up to heaven". @Luke 10:15. Is that the advantage that Capernaum had by the Lord coming down?
J.T. It was made greater than Nazareth; it was enhanced by such a Man dwelling there. In Matthew's account it says that light sprang up there (@Matthew 4:16). That is very beautiful and instructive as entering into what we are saying. Light springs up; it is not presented as coming down, it would all arise from what the Lord was in the place, how He lived there.
P.H.H. It is a reference to what was there.
J.T. There was substance behind it; light springs up out of what is substantial. In Genesis it is, "Let there be light", @Genesis 1:3 but in John, "In him was life, and the life was the light of men"; @John 1:4 a substantial thought is behind it. In Capernaum, if the Lord lived in any house or street, the light would be diffused every time He moved. John shows the result of all this. "These things he said in the synagogue, teaching in Capernaum". What is the effect? "Many therefore of his disciples having heard it said, This word is hard; who can hear it?" The Lord says, "Does this offend you? If then ye see the Son of man ascending up ... ? It is the Spirit which quickens, the flesh profits nothing". He is not appealing to the natural mind. It is a definite service by the great Teacher going on in the place, but He is not satisfying murmurers. He is teaching, not simply to be understood by the natural mind, but in relation to the Spirit of God.
P.H.H. "Communicating spiritual things by spiritual means". @1 Corinthians 2:13.
J.T. He is not descending to the natural mind, not whittling the truth down to make it acceptable to the natural mind; one would prostitute the truth if one did that. He says, "If then ye see the Son of man ascending up where he was before?"
{321}
That did not illuminate them any more than before, so the Lord says, "It is the Spirit which quickens, the flesh profits nothing ... . No one can come to me unless it be given to him from the Father. From that time many of his disciples went away back and walked no more with him". This describes what is frequently the position; the truth is more than people can receive. They will go a long way so long as they can receive things through their natural minds, but a time comes when they murmur. The truth is, they are tired of the thing; the ministry is not flattering them, they are not satisfied, they have not found what they sought, something to build them up in their own way. It is the cause of many withdrawing; the truth is too much for them. Peter sets out the position -- "Thou hast words of life eternal". @John 6:68. The Lord is not making it one bit easier for the natural mind; He is not gratifying it at all, in fact, He is going further. The Son of man ascending up -- do we follow that? It is the Spirit that quickens; we need quickening. It is what every christian ought to know, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" @John 6:52 Such questions denote the lack of a spiritual mind, and there is no hope of getting on without that. We are really better without the murmurers; they are hindering. There are people who begin to murmur in the meetings; they do not understand, they have come among us for something which they fail to find. Jesus says to the twelve, "Will ye also go away?" @John 6:67. He had ever the thought of the twelve, the brethren, as available at any time when called upon. The meeting must go on, the service of God must go on; that is the idea of the twelve, those who can move together, not jealous of one another. "Will ye also go away?" Then Peter comes in and answers the Lord's questions. "Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast words of life eternal; and we have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God". @John 6:67,68.
{322}
There is a man that has been learning and who knows what to say.
P.H.H. Would that fit in with your remarks about being qualified for ascension? Had Peter the idea that there was One there who could go into the sanctuary in connection with the service of God, "the holy one of God"? I wondered if it was a reference to Aaron, the saint of the Lord.
J.T. That would include Paul's doctrine. Paul qualifies us to ascend. Peter's remark shows that he had been learning all the time; he would be ready for anything further, for the line of ascension: "Raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies". @Ephesians 2:6. Peter would be ready for that. The Lord can take up any one of the twelve. If there is anyone He cannot use He makes it known; it is disclosed. We have to be ready for this test.
Rem. J.N.D. has a note with reference to verse 67 to the effect that the word 'will' implies not simply the act but the will or disposition to do it: 'Is it your will or disposition?' 'Do ye also wish to go away?'
J.T. The Authorised Version does not give the full thought of this passage. Peter says, "We have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God". @John 6:68
Ques. Why is the name of *Simon* Peter used?
J.T. Simon Peter was the name he had acquired in the testimony. It was the man that learned himself. In his second epistle he speaks of himself as Simon Peter. "When thou shalt be old", the Lord says, "thou shalt stretch forth thy hands". @John 21:18. There was complete resignation to the will of God, when he was old.
P.H.H. Whoever may be turning away in our localities, we are to go on to the height involved in Paul's teaching.
{323}
A.J.G. Does that bring to light the work of God in the place?
J.T. John is on the line of "Thou shalt see greater things", @John 1:50 a line that supports Paul, whose great thought in his ministry is that we are united to Christ, raised up together, made to sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ.
If there is no quickening with persons they are an incubus. If there are murmurers they may as well go; not that we want anyone to go away, but John speaks of things as they are. Luke would say, Do all you can to retain them, but John deals with things in the abstract.
Rem. F.E.R. spoke of our dragging unwilling people along with us.
J.T. "Will ye also go away?" @John 6:67 -- the Lord was ready even for that, but how delightful is Peter's answer; this is not a revelation, it is the outcome of what he had believed and known; it is the work of God.
Ques. Is Paul's service, when he spent three years among the saints in Ephesus, on this line?
J.T. It shows that all should be done to save. Plenty of time was given by Paul. The letters to Corinth would show how far grace will go, just as Luke does.
P.L. Departure furnishes the dark environment for betrayal; the betrayal of Christ enters largely into it.
J.T. Judas is called a devil; it is a solemn thing. If I have been a preacher or a teacher I have had a trust, and betrayal of that is of the character of Judas's course, the betrayal of a trust.
P.H.H. In chapter 7 His brethren say, "Manifest thyself to the world".
J.T. This is what relatives, if they are not spiritual, will do for you. The suggestion is, 'Make something of yourself', but they really mean, 'Make something
{324}
of us -- we want to benefit by your prominence'. Ambition and pride lay behind it all. They could not have been converted then; it is a sorry picture. The Lord refused to go in identification with His brethren.
A.J.G. "The world cannot hate you", the Lord says, showing what they were then.
J.T. The Lord indicated He was not going up with them. It says, He went up in secret, incognito, but He soon becomes known. "When it was now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught". He does not want publicity, but He wants to teach publicly. Whatever we have in our meetings belongs to the whole assembly.
P.L. The circle of testimony widens: Nazareth, Capernaum, and finally the temple, in spite of every combination to narrow it down.
J.T. We see this in chapter 7, a crucial chapter. The Lord carries on His ministry there and He goes up in secret, for the truth must reach the public ear. "Great the host of the publishers". @Psalm 68:11.
Rem. There is a difference between recognition of the public side and the seeking of publicity.
J.T. "In the last ... day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried saying, If anyone thirst, let him come to me and drink ... this he said concerning the Spirit". The positive thing is here for all those who believe on Him. I think the Lord would help us on these lines. Whatever He is giving us belongs to the public position.
A.J.G. In this chapter there seems to be, in spite of the general hostility, an undercurrent of exercise and enquiry. Is that what we may look for?
J.T. We may reckon on the spirit of enquiry so long as the Holy Spirit is here.
P.H.H. Does the crying stand over against going up secretly? The thing must go on; it is a matter of urgency.
{325}
J.T. He cries twice in this chapter. See verse 28: "Ye both know me and ye know whence I am". The Lord is known, who He is. He cries about that. In the abstract He is known. And then He cries about the rivers of living water.
Rem. There is no denying the authority of the ministry.
Rem. Crying involves feeling entering into the matter.
Rem. The prophetic word becomes known outside. If you think of Micaiah, he was hated on account of his prophetic ministry, it was well known, there was no denying its power.
J.T. The first cry is, "Ye both know me and ye know whence I am". In spite of the blatant apostasy He is known, there is comfort in that. Then there is the positive thing for man, the positive blessing of the Spirit, the living water.
P.L. The position is defined in the Lord's Person; and the wonderful character of His administration in the two cries set over against the apostasy today.
{326}
ACTIVITY IN CHRISTIANITY
@Acts 2:17,18; @Acts 3:7 - 9,11; @Acts 16:14; @Acts 21: 8,9
The word this evening has in mind that, as having received the Spirit severally and as of the assembly, we should be engaged in doing what our hands find to do, but that this should be carried on in the power of the anointing; for, however patient God is with us in our services as believers in Christ, making allowances for our ignorance, He in time would look for the anointing. So the Spirit of God in Peter, the Spirit having just come, calls attention to this passage from the book of Joel which shows that the Spirit would employ every believer. Most believers are not available to Him, but He would employ every one and support every one; so the list of persons in mind is, Your sons and your daughters, your young men and your elders, My bondmen and My bondwomen. "Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your elders shall dream with dreams; yea, even upon my bondmen and upon my bondwomen in those days will I pour out of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy", in each case what is in mind is being done. That is what is in mind; the Spirit of God, in coming, had all this in mind. He would deplore the thought that has become current of speaking of Him in an abstract way, and people assuming to have the Spirit and doing nothing.
Now my thought is to work out, from these verses, the form the work of God took as seen in this book that has become known by the term, the Acts, or the Acts of the Apostles; but the Acts -- leaving open who the persons are. There are such things as actions in christianity, but actions under control, for the spirit of control runs through the book, and it
{327}
has in mind the formation of the tabernacle, nothing less than that. Many actors, and actresses too, in the book have no part at all in the great work in mind; the work in mind contemplates the Spirit as in believers and actuating them to do what is to be done and to do it well, that is, to do it by the Spirit. And so, as I was saying, these verses contemplate sons and daughters, meaning that the families of believers are in mind for these services; they prophesy. You may say, We do not see anything like that now. Well, there is something amiss if we do not, and a sure way of overcoming what is amiss is accepting that it exists, and that it is not a question of the Spirit's fault, but ours. The book furnishes us with illustrations of daughters prophesying, as I have just read; it does not say Philip's daughters were prophetesses, but that they prophesied; they did the thing. And then we read, "Your young men shall see visions". You say, I have never met anybody who had. There is something amiss. Why should the Holy Spirit not cause us to see things? It is no doubt that our eyes are not trained in the direction in which He would cause us to see visions. We are told to set our minds on things above, and if our eyes are in the right direction we shall see something. One said, "We look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen", @2 Corinthians 4:18. There are wonderful things to be seen in the sense of what is invisible to the natural eye. Would the Holy Spirit not be wholly with me had I in mind to see something? And then we are told that "your old men shall dream dreams". Of course old men are apt to dream, and old sisters too, but the real meaning is they dream with dreams, that is, the thing has a compact form; it is a finished thing: they dream *with dreams*, that is the real thing, the outcome of the Spirit. Now I may be told that I cannot point to the concrete, that these things are all
{328}
past or else future. No doubt the Spirit of God has in mind in Joel to call attention to what is yet future in the coming day, but then Peter brought it in. Why should we be deprived of this promise? for it is a promise; every promise has some bearing upon us. So that if one, as an old man, an old brother, lays his head on his pillow in the sense of being possessed by the Holy Spirit, not a mere theoretic matter, but active; if, during his long years in the path he has been accustomed to rely on the Spirit, the Spirit will not fail him when his natural powers are waning, when indeed he scarcely needs any natural power; he will dream, the real thing, with dreams, and he will awake refreshed.
Well now, these remarks will enable me to proceed to show how in the other books of the Scripture, the truth presented in these verses is verified, and God takes up unlikely people; that is, unlikely from man's point of view. The selections in the Acts are very striking in that sense, God taking His own way, and you will observe sisters are included. They elect themselves too much out of things and the brothers will have it so; sometimes they love to have it so, but that ought not to be so. The Spirit of God includes the sisters in striking manner: sons and daughters and maidens, besides the young men and the elders, are all included. Why then should the matter not be taken up, even though we may say we have not experienced the thing? We say that too lightly -- but why? The enemy would be very well pleased, and is very well pleased, to have us leave it at that; that is the enemy's way, to get us to leave it at that, whereas the Spirit's way is to arouse us to things that the Scriptures require. So God sets about to take up unlikely persons; He has in mind the formation of a tabernacle. The main point in the book, the outline, is to have the tabernacle, the parts, all in their places and functioning. So, to take the book of Exodus as
{329}
illustrative, the enemy, the prince of this world, typified by the king of Egypt, says, Save all the females alive. Why did he say that? But he says in effect, Be sure not to let a male live. In his mind Satan is always short, you know, always behind; he has ten horns instead of twelve. Pharaoh stresses, Save them alive, not simply, Save them, but, Save them *alive*, they will help me, that is his thought, I can use them. From the standpoint of the formation of the race, as God made it, they are the most easily influenced, for the word 'man' covers male and female, as used by the Spirit. They are the most easily influenced; Satan knew that well about the woman, and of course Satan was operative in Pharaoh; and Pharaoh had in his mind, That is the side of the race I can influence so as to use them to build up my world, as if God could not use them! And, dear brethren, is it not sometimes implied that God does not use them in our meetings? Is it not implied by themselves? -- they elect themselves out of things. It is the devil. "Every daughter", @Exodus 1:22. Pharaoh said; but then God says, I can use the females, and I can use them to preserve the males too. That is the thought, to bring in Christ as the book of Revelation shows. But that in truth is the great victory: the seed of the woman is to bruise the serpent's head, and the seed is Christ, the male Son, a remarkable phrase; God saying, The very thing that Satan will destroy is brought in by the woman. Why then did he preserve the women? It is his shortness of vision. And so we find in Exodus, in the first chapter and in the early part of the second, five women employed by God in the salvation of the males, three of them used to save one male, and there are two midwives. Now we come to hospital nurses, for we are accustomed to that thought, why not apply it amongst the brethren? God made them houses; you may be sure there was some suggestion
{330}
of the tabernacle in those houses, so that we have these two women honoured in a striking manner. One would like to visit one of their houses; the architecture was of God, different from that of Egypt. There is not a relic of those houses in Egypt, I am sure, I never heard even a suggestion of an excavator or those seeking ancient things finding the foundation of one of those houses: they belonged to another world. These women belonged to another world, they belonged to a world in which women save men. Why not take that on? Here are your sons and your daughters and your maidens, Jehovah says. How remarkable these two women were; they concealed from the enemy the real process, but the result was there. And so, in chapter 2, we have Moses¬ mother, Moses¬ sister and Pharaoh's own daughter actively engaged in saving one man, and that, we may say, the greatest man in the Old Testament. That is God's way, Satan's short-sightedness makes room for God; "The weakness of God is stronger than men", @1 Corinthians 1:25 to use the word of the apostle to the Corinthians. He carries on His work but He carries it on through selected vessels. Do we dare to elect ourselves, to eliminate ourselves, from this, brother or sister? He names besides the old brothers, old men, dreaming with real dreams. You may be sure the enemy is defeated in every way in these things, in these activities, by the Spirit of God through every class amongst the brethren, every age and state, and station in life too, for it is bondmen and bondwomen.
Well now, the material is drawn out of the world on these lines, so that we have three thousand at once. No doubt the history of those three thousand would fill a book, but the Spirit of God passes over the details, and He takes up one man by himself to set out what He has in mind, the skill of His way. Think of what we are brought into, dear brethren, the
{331}
divine skill in the field of operations, and these things being the operations, that is, prophecy by the young people, young men and young women, servants and handmaidens, and seeing visions and dreaming with dreams; all these things severally and together mean the entire dislocation of the enemy's activities against us. What can cope with these things! One of the servants of the king of Syria said, There is a prophet in Israel who will tell you what you are thinking about. What can they do about that? He knows what you are thinking about, what you say in your bedchamber. As I said before, you may say these things are all past, but why should they be past? They are not past; that is the enemy saying that. If an old brother ceases to preach and to teach, he can dream. How useful is a dream by the Holy Spirit!
So the first one mentioned specifically is the lame man. He is active in life and the activity shows he is different from what he was, and different because of the work of God, not because of any schooling in this world, but because of the work of God: he is walking and leaping and praising God. Well, you cannot say that is past. Thank God it is not, it is the thing that God is stressing at the present time, walking and leaping and praising God and entering into the temple in that attitude. What liveliness, what cheer, what stimulation, in such a person! And then he held Peter and John; that is the testimony, so that the work of God is there, it cannot be denied, in this man. It would take me a long time, much longer than is available now, to go over the book of Acts, but it is a very fine enquiry to go through the book of Acts and note the persons the Spirit of God selects to fill out the divine thought. We have just one here and one there amid myriads, so that we may drink in the divine idea in the work of God. I have read two scriptures as to women, but there are many others one could have read; but
{332}
you take men such as Stephen, such as Philip, such as Saul, and many others; and then Lydia, not forgetting Rhoda; we often speak of Rhoda, she was available for something. But Lydia suits my purpose, because she is an active woman already; she was not one of those sisters, or women, who would say, I have no time; she was a woman of affairs, a merchant. She had time for prayer, and the Spirit of God tells us that the Lord opened that woman's heart. When it happened we are not told. In the quiet of the night perhaps, or maybe when she was making a sale of purple, for she was a seller; whenever it happened, it happened, dear brethren, the Lord opened her heart; the *Lord* did it, He had access to it. She is not presented to us as a convert, as we say, who had not the truth before; she evidently had, she is a worshipper, the Lord had access to her heart. What an attitude of soul for the sisters, instead of being occupied with so many trifling things, foolish things too, for the heart to be accessible to Christ. And think of the Lord's thought about this woman; it is a calculated matter, that is, He operates in relation to the testimony He presents, whatever form it may take at any time, and this is a heart matter, it is not a conscience matter with her, it is a heart matter; the Lord had, I am sure, consideration about this matter. It was a peculiarly pleasant operation on His part: the heart was accessible and He operated on it, and He operated on it for one thing, that she might get the very best there was. Think of the shop windows (not that I am speaking against them) and such like wretched things that occupy us. The Lord's thought is that we are to get the best there is, and when I speak of this on the divine side, how much is in it! And she was ready for it, the Lord made her ready for it. She had been going on with prayer, but the Lord says, in effect, Lydia, I want you to get the very best that
{333}
there is at the present time. Peter had been working and now Paul had come; no doubt she had not yet realised how great the man was who had come to Philippi; the Lord would give her to understand that a greater than Solomon was there. How great the position was, the presence of Paul in Philippi, and He says, Lydia, you must get all he has to give, and you must attend to the thing too, because the word would imply that it needed attention, the mystery in which things are hidden. Paul had prayed for people, he had combated for people, he had agonised for people that they might get the truth he had; and he said, I want you to know all about it, too; he said that in Ephesians. He said to Lydia, as it were, I am ready to spend all the time necessary in your case. All could see that which had come about in that sister; she would prick up her ears when Paul was speaking. She would like to hear Luke; he was there, Silas was there. They would all speak well, no doubt, but as soon as Paul spoke, she would listen to that. I know people who almost turn a deaf ear to the truth of the mystery, the heavenly calling, but they spend long enough in speaking of one convert in China; he is more important if in China than in England, they think. But Lydia would not be like that. The Lord had had to say to her: He opened her heart, for He had access to it, and He caused her to attend to the things spoken by Paul. That is what is needed, dear brethren, the heavenly calling, the mystery, would stand out at the present time. There is the mystery of iniquity; one might almost say it is no longer a mystery. What will meet the mystery of iniquity? The mystery of God; and the Lord is ready to open our hearts to attend to what Paul has to say, which is now available to us to be understood by the power of the Spirit. That is what is needed. We shall not get through to the end in victory unless we understand the mystery.
{334}
The great burden of Colossians and Ephesians is that the saints should understand the mystery of God in which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. So I believe he has reached the highest point in Philippians; Paul left Philippi, as we often say, on the highest note: he and his companion, Silas, went to Lydia; Paul would be refreshed. Let her talk to us, he would say of such. What will she tell us about? Oh, she had a meat-offering, she would have something heaving up in her heart, for that is the idea. How Paul would love to hear such things, and Silas too. No doubt she would ask them about their experiences in the prison; what a subject, what had happened there would be. It was a time of doing things; the jailor, of course, did his wicked part, but he was changed; God converted him. But then these men, Paul and Silas, had their prayer meeting and their praise meeting and their gospel meeting in the prison; they were doing things. They could easily have said, What can we do now? They had their feet fast in the stocks, but they had all these meetings there, in the principle of it, and Lydia would be delighted to hear all these things, and how delightful it would be to these two men to hear what she had to say. God was working in her house. The jailor, of course, became a brother, but who were the others? "They came to Lydia; and having seen the brethren, they exhorted them and went away". @Acts 16:40. It was a scene of holy activity and formation; activity is nothing without formation. Of course, Lydia was one of them, others in her house too, but now the great divine thought is reached in Philippi, the brethren were there: Paul went out and left the place having seen Lydia and the brethren.
The last scripture is read just to touch on the idea of doing. We entered "into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was of the seven". The brethren had rich thoughts in those days, they had themes,
{335}
designations, that were full of spiritual richness -- the seven. I would like to know these seven men, this man Philip was one of them, and he had four daughters. Then there were the five hundred, they lived on and on: Paul said, "The most remain until now, but some also have fallen asleep", @1 Corinthians 15:6. What assets they were in this world! -- five hundred to whom Jesus appeared as risen from amongst the dead. But this is one of the seven and he is *the* evangelist. These words have richness in them, and the Spirit of God uses them as Luke uses them. "We came to Caesarea; and entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was of the seven, we abode with him". Apparently there was no thought of going to hotels in those days if there were brethren in the town. Why should we? Why should houses not be opened for such men, representative of God? And then we are told that "this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied". Well, I say, I do not understand. Acknowledge it then, tell, God you do not understand it, and tell him there are sisters in your meeting and ask Him why they do not prophesy. You will get help on those lines. God has never forgotten these things; they are living to Him as they were in that day, no change with Him, no change in the Spirit of God; they have come down to us through Him and they are here today. There are so many things that are a dead letter to us -- I admit it, I have not seen much of this. But I do see that God is looking for acknowledgment, looking for honest men and women. Why are things different from what they used to be? They "prophesied", that is, they did the thing. It does not say Paul and his company listened to them; I should not deny that they did; Paul would listen to them. Do not misunderstand me, dear brethren. I am not at all suggesting that sisters should stand up in a meeting and prophesy -- other scriptures forbid that -- but this
{336}
scripture says there were such things as women who prophesied, and there were four of them. It would enrich the house; it made it a unique house, and with all that distinction, Philip the evangelist and the four virgin daughters who prophesied, they are hospitable; these women would do their best for visitors, I am sure.
That is all. I do not wish to prolong the word, but just to bring forward these facts that we might have them in our hearts. If they humble us and lead us to be little in our own thoughts, it is something. Every one of us is, in the mind of God, to be doing something in relation to the testimony, and to be under the spirit of control so that all that one does is contributory to the one tabernacle into which the glory entered where God resides, the very residence of God Himself by the Spirit.
{337}
EARLY FEATURES OF THE SERVICE OF GOD
@Job 38:4 - 7; @Exodus 15:1,2
J.T. These verses would help us to see and understand the early features of the service of God. In the passage read in Job, Jehovah Himself is speaking, and evidently refers to mutual feelings and movement among the morning stars occasioned by what He had done; they sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy. That would suggest mutual feeling in relation to what is presented to us by God at any given time, and is foundational as to the service of God. @Exodus 15 shows that leadership marked the service of God at the beginning, Moses and the children of Israel sang. Any right understanding of the facts relative to the subject in the New Testament will enable us to see how these thoughts appear there, mutual feeling in response being evident in regard to what is being presented by God. The record of the partaking of the Lord's supper in Matthew and Mark ends up with this thought of mutual feeling; they sang a hymn, evidently they were affected together by what had come before them. Then we have leadership as in @Luke 24, the Lord being in the midst of His own, He led them out. We also have the fact that the Spirit leads -- "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, *these* are sons of God", @Romans 8:14. I thought we might consider the two scriptures read in the Old Testament with these thoughts in mind so that we might know how to take part in the service of God in the assembly. All that enters into the partaking of the Lord's supper is more on the mutual side -- the leadership of Christ is subsequent -- we came together to break bread, Luke says. The experience together promotes mutual feeling, but specially in
{338}
regard of what is presented, so that love has its place, and it is as those mutually together that we are equal to being led, whether it be by the Lord, or by the Spirit. @Exodus 15 is the first introduction of the service of God formally, not as required by Him, but as the outcome of the state of the people. Verse 31 of chapter 14 says, "And Israel saw the great power with which Jehovah had wrought against the Egyptians; and the people feared Jehovah, and believed in Jehovah, and in Moses his bondman. Then sang Moses and the children of Israel". @Exodus 14:31. We have Jehovah and His servant Moses, the one appointed to lead His people, before us, for they were led as a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron. "Then sang Moses and the children of Israel" would be the outcome of the state reached at the end of chapter 14, involving their recognition of the leader or, mediator, Moses, God's bondman. So that in the celebration of the Lord's supper it is our matter, our doing. We come together to break bread, assemble indeed, and as there is a steady increase of mutual feeling, the Spirit of God having His place with us, a condition is reached suitable for the Lord to come in and have part, a condition in which He Himself serves, He leads.
E.G. Is the singing and the shouting in @Job 38:7 the outcome of Christ coming in as the corner stone?
J.T. There is a certain ornamentation in what is done. Applied to the assembly it would be that. We have Jehovah asking these questions, "Where wast thou when I founded the earth? Declare, if thou hast understanding. Who set the measures thereof -- if thou knowest? or who stretched a line upon it? Whereupon were the foundations thereof sunken?" It is a question of what God has done. The heavens are not included, the earth is spoken of. So understanding is in mind: "If thou hast understanding". It seems as if it is a
{339}
challenge to us as taking part in the service of God, whether it is with understanding of what is presented to us.
F.I. Does the singing in Job precede or follow what you read in @Exodus 15?
J.T. I should say it preceded it historically, and indeed in the service; mutual feeling is basic in the service of God.
Ques. Does that spring from the appreciation of the love of Christ that everyone would have?
J.T. Yes, we are affected by what is presented to us, affected together, so it reminds us of the need of eliminating all that would interfere with mutual understanding of what is presented. There is to be power to disallow all that is extraneous to what is presented at the time. God would help us to do this. "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law", @Romans 7:25 whatever that law may be, and whatever its particular application. Then there is the renewing of the mind, so that as having our minds in control, each of us can eliminate all that is extraneous and arrive together at the one thing before us. There is much that we could speak of to God in the way of thanksgiving that would be out of place in the assembly. What is immediately presented to us in the Lord's supper is within certain limits, and we are able to eliminate from our minds all that is not in keeping with that.
Ques. Would it involve sensitiveness as to what is working in the affections of others, as we sit down together?
J.T. That is what I was thinking. Our minds are alike. We are together mutually: we meet together and "the Lord is the maker of them all". @Proverbs 22:2. Normally each believer has arrived at a point where he has control of his mind. Having control of my mind, I do not allow it to be lawless, I do not admit anything unsuitable; that makes way for divine operations.
{340}
A.D.T. Does the drinking out of one cup produce mutual feeling?
J.T. All that is presented to us in the Lord's supper is calculated to produce mutual feeling, so that we have in this passage in Job the mutual thought, antitypically the morning stars sang together. They would all be affected by what they saw, what Jehovah did before their eyes. The morning stars are symbolical, expressing the mutual side; the sons of God follow; they shout for joy; they are more affected.
P.H.H. What is involved in singing? It comes in many times in Scripture, saints singing, the Lord Jesus singing; what exactly does it have in mind for us in relation to the service of God?
J.T. It involves a power that God has placed in us, He made man's mouth, He made the whole vocal system, the most wonderful in the whole creation, the most wonderful piece of work by the Creator. Speaking, of course, is the outcome of calculated balanced thought; singing is more an expression of sentiment and feeling, but proceeding in a musical setting. It affords pleasure, but I think the word denotes celebration, giving expression to our admiration of what God has done in relation to creation, a wonderful thing to see; but in redemption, as in @Exodus 15, the people are directly involved; they are benefiting directly from what has happened. It moves us to holy sympathetic feeling, and yet intelligence, because singing involves words and the words convey what is intelligent and intelligible. The Lord sang in the midst of the assembly. Singing may not go as far as praising, but the Lord went as far as praising and singing.
Rem. The sisters have an equal part in that.
J.T. They do; perhaps there is more body in their part.
H.P. Is the singing in the nature of response?
{341}
J.T. Quite so, admiration of what was seen, what God was doing. It seems to me to be very interesting that God would bring us back to that point. Earlier in the book of Job we are told that the sons of God on two occasions had come up to present themselves before Jehovah, so there is some link there. God takes them back here to certain things that He did Himself. It is very significant He brings in this matter of singing together, singing because of what was there.
A.J.G. Does it suggest that God has always cherished the thought of having His creatures sympathetically responsive to Himself, and being responded to by sons? These thoughts are developed in the particular light in which God is revealed.
J.T. Quite so, one star differs from another in glory, and each has its name. They would shine, they would be for testimony -- lights; they on their part would celebrate their Creator. Antitypically, of course, the stars and the sons would be the same persons; saints viewed in that light to shine as lights in the world. We are affected in testimony, we are not inert or without feeling in our testimony; we admire what there is of God. In sonship it would be the family thought.
W.C. Would the spirit underlying @Romans 16 enter into the way the saints come together? As taking account of each other and the spirit of the salutations one to another, something of the morning star idea would be seen?
J.T. You mean each person had some distinctive feature that would shine?
W.C. In the recognition and appreciation of one another, the idea of salutation comes in.
J.T. A very good suggestion at this point, involving mutual feeling. The stars would be the saints in their testimony, not a family thought, although by
{342}
extension we can connect the sun, moon and stars as a family. The allusion in Joseph's dream to the sun, moon and stars, as Jacob understood them, would imply a family, a father, mother and the children, but as set in the heavens the stars are for lights, made also as the sun and the moon, but they are secondary, as the children would be in a family secondary to the parents. They are to shine, however, and in the shining they are feeling as seen in the type, whereas the sons would go further, suggesting the family thought, "shouting"; they are in known relationship.
Ques. Is there significance in the fact that the singing is regulated by David? It does not seem to be given a very prominent part in the service of God until his time. Is there anything to be learnt in that?
J.T. I think there is. I think Exodus is more mutual. Although we have Moses, yet in the building of the tabernacle there is hardly any stress on the graded work of God which would develop into princes. Under David the princely thought is stressed in relation to the house, but in Exodus it is not so; it is the thought of one's heart prompting him, that is the heave offering, not so much what he has. So that we get in the type of the tabernacle that every person is in his place. The princely thought is not stressed in the giving in Exodus. I believe Exodus lays the basis of what we are saying, although we have leadership in Moses; but under David, we have himself and the princes; there is substance in what they represent. Therefore in coming together in assembly, we are mutual -- "we being assembled", Luke says @Acts 20:7; although there were princes there, there was variety, including Paul and Luke himself; that would soon show itself as the service went on, that is as the service proceeds we discover what wealth there is.
Ques. Would the morning stars in that way bring out the distinctiveness of each in the testimony
{343}
as mutually together and merged bodywise in view of the Lord having His place distinctively?
J.T. You can count so many. The hundred and twenty persons in @Acts 1 each had a name, and as the book of Acts proceeds, we find out what is really there. There is a great variety in that company, a variety of formation and glory. It is one of the most interesting subjects, what was in that upper room and what developed, but the names begin -- so many persons; what develops brings out the distinctions. It is that that makes way for leadership, because it is not only that the Lord takes part as leading in the assembly -- the Spirit too -- but the work of God in the persons present enters into the leadership. I do not know whether that is plain, but it ought to be considered. This or that brother may take part, but the work of God must be recognised, mutuality *must* make room for the work of God in all its phases.
A.B. Would leadership be emphasised in the princely giving in @Numbers 7? Would princes lead in giving?
J.T. That is where princely qualities come out. It is voluntary. Every Israelite could not give what each of those gave, and we must make room for them. I may say I have the same liberty as another, but have I?
A.J.G. Do you mean the Lord's leadership in the assembly takes place through princes?
J.T. Certainly; we must make room for Him through them.
Rem. Referring to @1 Chronicles 29:6, "The chief fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and the comptrollers of the king's business, offered willingly". And verse 8: "They with whom stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of Jehovah". @1 Chronicles 29:8.
{344}
It seems as though all the people were drawn into the matter by that means.
J.T. Quite so. In the chapters of the book of Ezekiel that treat of the sanctuary and the service of God we have a prince, never called a king in that relation. Sometimes he mingles with the people as one of them and sometimes he is seen alone (see @Ezekiel 44:3; @Ezekiel 46:8 - 10), but at any time it soon shows itself that he is a prince, not merely official, but able to furnish sacrifices for all the people -- a very remarkable thing; every Israelite could not do that.
Rem. In Josiah's time the Spirit of God put them next after the king (@2 Chronicles 35:8).
J.T. Exactly, therefore I think the prince in Ezekiel extends further than Christ Himself. The thought rises up to Christ Himself; He alone could embody it in its fulness, but it is a graded thought and can be seen in others, so that we must make full room for the work of God in our meetings, not merely so many persons breaking bread, but the work of God. There is the idea of numbering the persons in Acts, but that is not all; in Paul's epistles you hardly get any idea of number -- I do not know that you ever get an assembly number -- it is a question of the work of God.
P.H.H. Paul seemed to be much more free in presenting his ministry in some assemblies than in others because there was more work of God there.
J.T. The Corinthians missed a great deal as they did not make room for him. What a prince he was! They did not see that on his first visit; they could not see it. In the second letter he begins to tell them what he had gone through; they did not make room for it. Think of the wealth he had acquired. It was fourteen years before he told them he had been in the third heaven -- what princely qualities that would furnish!
{345}
E.S.H. Would a portion of @Psalm 68 fit in with what you are saying, from verse 24: "They have seen thy goings, O God, the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary. The singers went before, the players on stringed instruments after"? @Psalm 68:24,25. Is that the same idea?
J.T. Very good, I am glad you brought that in: that psalm is full of richness.
H.P. Is it seen in @Acts 13, where we first have the assembly functioning among the gentiles? Various names are mentioned, would they suggest princes?
J.T. Just so. They were *in the assembly* that was there. The better known they were, the more place, I believe, would be given to them.
Ques. Do I gather you are stressing that the mutual state must precede the princely feature coming forward?
J.T. That is what I understand. It is a very important matter. We begin with so many saints in the meeting; we can count them, the number of the names, and then the thought arises, What is there under each name? We have to make room for what may be there; it is the full work of God that makes room for God.
E.G. Would five words with the understanding indicate the work of God?
J.T. It shows how room was made. The understanding in the believer comes in; he knows how to control himself and he does not go beyond his measure. Another may say more. We want to get the wealth there is, whatever there is. Let there be scope for the development of what is there. Mutual feeling affected by what God presents will make room for what is there. That is, there are no rival feelings, no effort to be prominent in the service, but each taking part according to what he is.
Ques. Is the leadership definitely in connection with the princes? "And the prince of princes of the Levites was Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest". @Numbers 3:32.
{346}
J.T. Quite so, he had princes under him. There would be no rival feeling about anyone like that.
Ques. It says, "Hezekiah ... gathered the princes of the city, and went up to the house of Jehovah", @2 Chronicles 29:20. Do you think that makes it a local matter for the time being as we sit down together? Does that make it concrete, the personnel gathered as we sit down?
J.T. Certainly, each of us ought to have an estimate of the value of brethren. One would seek to know the brethren. We have it also in Scripture -- "I know him". We arrive at it by holy, affectionate observation of what there is in the meeting, and make room for it; it is placed there by God.
P.H.H. When you come to the thought of leadership, particularly as you remark in Exodus, does that mean that the song is going deeper or higher? I was thinking that in @Exodus 15 it speaks about singing unto Jehovah, then, "My strength and song is Jah" and then "my God". There are at least three names by which God is expressed, and "Jah", I understand, suggests very high ground.
J.T. Yes. There is a deeper penetration in the title "Jah" than in the use of the title "Jehovah" or "God", and princely qualities would show themselves, power of discernment, as the service goes on higher and higher. There is not supposed to be a drop, or a reduction of spiritual power; we are to be sustained.
Ques. Referring to the princes under Hezekiah, it says they brought certain things without being told to bring them, and as all these matters proceed, it says at the end, "And king Hezekiah and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise to Jehovah with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and bowed their heads and worshipped". @2 Chronicles 29:30.
{347}
Is that the highest note?
J.T. To bring David in would be the suggestion of the highest note.
Ques. How does the end of @2 Chronicles 5 bear on what you have in mind? The thought of mutuality seems to come out there, then the glory of the Lord comes in.
J.T. The participants are Levites or priests; it is mutuality, of course, but not as we come together to break bread. The participants are viewed as representing spirituality, not simply so many persons; although we have a hundred and twenty priests they represent spirituality. Leadership is not there, it is the exalted Spiritual state in the assembly that is typified, so that room is made for the glory to come in.
The princely feature of the work of God is in view in David and Solomon; here in @Exodus 15 it is the mediator and the people, Moses and the people; it is leadership here.
Ques. You mentioned earlier the thought of the leading of the Spirit, besides the leading of the Lord. What had you in mind?
J.T. We have these initial thoughts in view in Job and Exodus, but we may well look at the New Testament for leadership. When the Lord came in, according to @Luke 24:36, things were not right -- not that there was not wealth there -- and the Lord had to bring in adjustment, and He did: He opened their understanding that they might understand the Scriptures, Moses and the prophets and the psalms. After that the thought of leading comes in; His leading comes in as we are all together, affected by what is presented to us. We come together; that is, so many persons, but there is spiritual wealth as at Troas, and what is presented to us has an effect upon that. Spiritual measure in the saints will be
{348}
affected by what is presented; they discern and value what is presented; then that makes way; the Lord waits for that. Really that ought to appear in the part relating to the Lord's supper, because so much is presented to us in it. What follows on the Lord's supper itself is not the result of what is presented, it is the result of what is there, being led. Each initially would be affected by what is presented. Paul would be affected more than anybody at the Lord's supper: he would be affected by what the bread and the cup present.
H.P. Do we learn leadership in the assembly as following the Lord's supper? What you have been speaking of leads on to Christ as leading in the midst of the assembly.
J.T. Just what we have been saying. Take the princes that were there at Troas, seven names are mentioned of men that accompanied Paul; these would all understand Paul, and we are told there were many lights in the upper chamber, an allusion also to what was there. There was a very low state in one young man; he was not affected and that is often the case, but where the work of God has taken effect in our souls we would be affected by what is presented to us; no matter how many times we have taken the Lord's supper, the greater the spiritual formation, the more we would be affected. Those who are shallow in their formation should discern that and accept it, and take part according to that, and make room for what is there in others. What we are dealing with now is the work of God. The assembly is the home of the work of God in persons, the place where rivalry is eliminated; not that we are simply so many brethren, but we are brethren mutually in the way we are affected by what is presented, each in his measure. Here we have in Job the idea of measure. God says, "Who set the measures thereof -- if thou knowest?" That is the principle of
{349}
measure; God is the God of measure. Exodus brings it in. The assembly is where measure has the greatest place, because of the supreme spiritual refinement that belongs to it.
Ques. Does leadership through substance in the service of praise to God stand related to the Corinthian position?
J.T. Yes. The second epistle brings in the thought of measurement. Paul says, "A measure to reach even unto you". @2 Corinthians 10:13. But what was their measure? -- did it reach to him? It did not, they did not know his measure. They had leadership there, but that leadership had diverted from Paul, from the work of God; that often happens. It stands very intimately related to the Corinthian epistles, and the point is, if I find my measure is very small, I am to recognise it. If I recognised it, I would not push myself forward. I may have an intelligent apprehension of things, but the work of God is what one *is*. If I have a true estimate of my own measure, I recognise that others have a greater measure, and the Lord has put them there because they have it, and room is to be made for them, otherwise God will not get what is due to Him in the gathering.
P.L. @John 12 illustrates that, the substance there becomes available.
J.T. A good reference -- you mean Mary. Mary had the thing. If Judas had known that she was going to speak, that is to say, going to use the ointment, he probably would have interfered with it. Many do. It was *after* she anointed the Lord that he spoke, and he should not have spoken; he was not qualified. It often happens that the most unqualified brother takes part because others who could do not, and therefore they make room for such a man as that. A long pause makes room for such a voice as that of Judas; not that any brother is a Judas, but he was a person not qualified to speak. Room is
{350}
made for unspiritual people when the spiritual do not take part.
A.J.G. Referring again to the leading of the Spirit, do I gather that you said this is connected with what there is in the souls of the saints? Would that be as following on a lead given by the Lord through a prince?
J.T. Just so. "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, *these* are sons of God". @Romans 8:14. They are marked off, I think, by the part they take in the assembly, by their spirituality. These brothers ought to be allowed full scope, because the Lord is going to come in through such; they make room for Him. These brothers are led by the Spirit of God, not by their own promptings. The promptings of the Spirit of God make room for Him. It is in that way that we get the leadership. Of course the Spirit makes room for the leadership of Christ; the sons become manifest as they are moving in spiritual power.
Rem. We can count on the Lord -- I speak reverently -- to do His part, to present what is most calculated to affect us in the service of God. The more substance one has, the more one can respond.
J.T. Quite so. It is most affecting: that which is presented in the assembly is intended to affect us. How often we have been in assembly and partaken of the Lord's supper, and yet our keenness of appreciation does not diminish, it is as fresh as ever; so mutuality arising from appreciation of what is presented is in mind. We are all affected together by what is presented.
W.C. In alluding to what is presented, are you referring to the loaf and the cup, and the activities of the Lord on that occasion?
J.T. Yes.
Rem. In the Acts He presented Himself living. That would be in view of testimony and yet in view also of the service of God.
{351}
J.T. Very good. Why is that word used? It is not simply that He was there, that He presented Himself, but that it was as *living*. How He is appreciated as He presents Himself! Things are narrowed down to what tends to produce the best results.
Ques. Would you look for emphasis to be laid on something particular on each occasion?
J.T. Quite so. I believe no one would be more affected than Paul, although he had been in the third heaven. The Lord gains and each of us gains, by making room for what there is, including sisters as well as brothers.
Ques. Would @Luke 24, the Lord speaking from the Scriptures, suggest a word of power given to recover the saints to this leadership?
J.T. That is another thing. If brothers such as Timotheus had said anything at Troas, I am sure Paul would have listened to it very attentively.
Rem. John turned to see the voice.
J.T. Yes, what was presented to him. Then we are told what he saw. Applying that to the Lord's supper, you are limited to that, what you see. It ought to affect us supremely.
P.L. Moses turned aside to behold the wondrous sight, deeply affected.
J.T. Yes. When Jehovah saw he turned aside, He called him by name. That is the thought, we are affected by what is presented. As was remarked, the Acts begins with the thought of the Lord presenting Himself living. He wanted them to see Him in that way: it is not exactly the Lord's supper, but He wanted them to see Him in a particular way; it conveys the idea we are speaking of.
Ques. It is striking that Moses, David and Solomon all seem to set out just what the Lord did at that time, and each passage is preceded by the thought of assembling, Moses in Exodus, David in
{352}
the end of 1 Chronicles, Solomon in the end of @2 Chronicles 5. Do you think that would answer?
J.T. Very good. The people were assembled to a position where the best was seen, and a lead given.
Ques. In the end of 2 Corinthians the apostle speaks of the authority the Lord had given him. Does he see an increase in their stature?
J.T. 2 Corinthians indicates that. The first letter brought in a better state. He had much more scope amongst them when he visited Corinth again. First and second Corinthians have in mind to bring about tabernacle conditions in a local company. "So also is the Christ" @1 Corinthians 12:12 -- the anointed vessel, not Christ personally, but what marks the saints normally. In Corinthians he brings in the anointing so that it *should* mark them. "He that establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is God". @2 Corinthians 1:21. He would thus get in amongst them as much as possible, be one of them, and thus they would recognise his stature; he had a measure reaching to them. What was their measure? They were measuring themselves with themselves and reaching no end at all. God had brought in the greatest measure with Paul, and he was there amongst them, but did they value the quality, the wealth that was there?
P.L. Would the weighing of the vessels in Ezra's day bear upon this, the appreciation of what is available?
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. Have you in mind that the general principle of democracy in the world may creep in in a spiritual sense to hinder our recognition of the work of God in each other, and so prevent the best being obtainable in the service of God?
J.T. It is affecting the brethren considerably, and what we are saying is to correct that influence, because God has made differences. Star differs from star in glory, and this is introduced in Corinthians in
{353}
view of that very thing. We have to think of ourselves soberly. The Lord would exercise us as to measure. God has dealt to each a measure of faith. I am there knowing my measure, and with a desire for the appreciation of the measures of others, greater measures. I believe the position at Troas implies that there were great measures, as well as very small measures there. Eutychus would set forth a small measure, but room would be made for greater ones.
{354}
GRACE LEADING INTO THE DIVINE WAY
@Isaiah 30:21; @Acts 18:24 - 28; @Mark 10:51,52
These scriptures are read this evening because they teach us as to the divine way. First as to those who, as called by grace and affected by grace, are regarded as in that way in measure, but not wholly, the voice is from behind, "This is the way". Then an example of one in Apollos who is in like manner partially in the way, not wholly, but ready for adjustment, a man who having received light was accurate, not slovenly, in his use of the Scriptures or in dealing with divine things; he was an accurate man. And then thirdly one, in like manner an example, who was ready for light and help and received light and help and followed Jesus in the way, that is, one ready for leadership, but leadership in the way, as in much else, of course.
Now it will be observed that this section in Isaiah begins with verse 18, "And therefore will Jehovah wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he lift himself up, that he may have mercy upon you; for Jehovah is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him. For the people shall dwell in Zion, at Jerusalem". @Isaiah 30:18,19. So that this instruction in the verse read is in relation to the outshining of grace. We shall not be amenable to adjustment and leadership according to God save as we are genuinely affected by grace. Some have come into the way ostensibly, unaffected genuinely by grace. They become hard in the way, difficult to help, and they grow up, if young, in households, without learning spiritually. If heads of houses, whilst they may have the Scriptures, pursue regularly what others do, through being unaffected by grace and as wanting in spiritual instinct which goes with the teaching of
{355}
grace, they may take on methods current around in the religious world. So the need, dear brethren, of being affected by grace, for grace teaches. Nature teaches; there are many elements of teaching. Grace is peculiar as preparing and creating soil for divine seed. Whereas we may externally take on the very greatest things and be sincere to a point, we may yet fail to take in the impressions that we need to be fitted for heaven, fitted for the testimony here. For there is to be co-operation, not only so, but unity, whether as saints or whether as levites specially fitted to serve. The need for co-operating, cohesion in our operations with our brethren and fellow-servants, is very great and grace affords the soil in us for that teaching that makes for perfection. So that God may say triumphantly, 'They are all taught of God'.
Now an illustration of this we have in "Abinadab on the hill" @1 Samuel 7:1, a significant phrase to add to his name, him into whose hands the ark was committed, the most precious possible thing to have in one's house. "The time was long" @1 Samuel 7:2 in his house symbolically. The children coming in, growing up in that house of Abinadab on the hill would surely come under the teaching involved in the ark. So many thoughts converge on it that every time one looked upon it or thought upon it a divine thought would come into one's mind, were one spiritual. And yet after many years when the ark was to be moved from that house it was placed on a new cart and the two sons of Abinadab, or grandsons, for the time was long, drove the cart. Where was the teaching? Where was the influence of grace operative, that in all these years that family had not learned what was proper to the ark? Does it not suggest, dear brethren, what is current often, that we have the external form of things, even the reading of the Scriptures with our family, attending all the meetings, pursuing all that is current and led by spiritual men and yet be
{356}
unaffected by grace, what the ark, of all things, should have suggested? And what is the thought, what is the instruction, the moral bearing of the facts? That that man, honoured, living on a hill, ostensibly in moral elevation, had himself failed to profit by the presence of the ark in his house, and his children correspondingly had failed to profit by it. I say nothing now of the failure of David in allowing the new cart, but Abinadab had more to do with the ark than David up to that time, much more. David had thought of it far away. He thought of its unsuitable position. Did he know that Abinadab was not learning from it, he would think even more feelingly about it. So that he fails too in the matter. I mean the Scriptures record that he said nothing against the new cart, but the onus of the failure obviously is with Abinadab who had had the greatest opportunity of acquiring knowledge of the ark. Surely the Scriptures would go with it, and the thought, were he at all spiritual, would come every day to them, Am I acting suitably in relation to this precious thing which I am entrusted with? But apparently there never was such an enquiry or he would have referred to the Scriptures that govern the ark, nor did his sons apparently gain anything. Even in their youthful minds they failed to look into the Scriptures and to acquire the spirit proper to the ark and to its residence.
I mention that, dear brethren, to show how, apart from the influence of grace in our hearts and minds, we shall fail of that instinctive ability to receive divine impressions, to learn divine lessons and to know profitably from childhood the holy Scriptures as inspired of God. They were certainly profitable to instruct this favoured man and his family as to what was proper to the ark, but that family failed. You see, therefore, that apart from grace, the influence of grace, we shall fail, although we may have all the
{357}
forms. They come down to us as read in the Scriptures, and as others, godly men, have led and have instructed us in them, and we shall be in danger, unless rightly affected, of taking on something, if not everything, something at least of the current religious customs. They may seem right, they may seem profitable, but in result we shall find just what came out in the household of Abinadab. We shall be carrying on in something that is inimical to the testimony, to say nothing more, and deflecting from it, deflecting toward another direction. That is all I had to say on this scripture, so striking, as I understand it. "Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it". It is a voice in the way. It is not, That is the way, it is, "This is the way". Whatever way you turn, this voice is to be heard today. It is the end of the dispensation. "This is the way", and if I see this, there must be something in it that is tangible, that is evident, as being the way of God. That is the next thing. "This is the way". Those of us who have anything to do in active service know well, with heaviness too at times, the hardness of the soil, the dullness of the ear, and how real christians, as we speak, are ready to go a little way and then they see the bear in the way and turn back. Indeed the very chapter from which we read in Mark indicates one who ran to it and then left it.
And so I proceed to Acts, a title that is to be observed as to this book in Scripture, meaning that things were done. Some of us lately were engaged a little with a word by Peter in his first address at Jerusalem, how he called attention to the prophet Joel, the coming in of the Spirit, how sons and daughters of the people should prophesy, not become prophets and prophetesses, but prophesy. How young men should see visions, not of course be visionaries which is a word which carries further
{358}
than what is meant here, that they should really as of old see visions, such as Paul saw, for instance, at Corinth; the Lord appeared to him in a vision. The thing was operative; there was such a thing as that, and men dreaming dreams and menservants and maidservants prophesying. Some of us were speaking about this and it is characteristic of the Acts. The very title, it seems to me, is divinely chosen although not formally so, as I understand, but it means a book of doings, a book in which we hear that things were done. And that is, dear brethren, what I believe is important, that God is looking for things to be done. I believe the force of that well-known expression in @Ephesians 3 is that Christ as operating is in our hearts, dwells in our hearts by faith. "That the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts" @Ephesians 3:17 -- the Christ, the One who does things, and I believe that is what governs this remarkable book from which I have read, and it really implies the divine way. It is more what was done in a concrete way than what was required to be done. The apostles, of course, form the teaching governing it, but it is more what is done than what is required to be done, as if God would show with pleasure the effect of His own work in His people.
And so this remarkable man, Apollos, is representative of an independent work of God, not indeed that this word is to be understood as different or antagonistic to anything else; it is that God was working in Alexandria in relation to partial light, that is, the baptism of John, for God follows light, however partial it may be. There is much said about light; it is one of the most remarkable terms in the scripture, as to the qualifying words especially, as the apostle Paul uses it. I believe in this very scripture in Isaiah it says that the sun will be sevenfold brighter and the moon too will become brighter. But then we have corresponding gradations in the other direction
{359}
and the baptism of John did not afford the clear shining from heaven that belongs to christianity, but it was nevertheless light, and there are myriads of our brethren with whom God is working, but His Spirit is greatly hampered because of the imperfection of the light that is shining, the imperfection of the truth presented to them. But this man was not the only one of the kind. We have others in the next chapter, who, although at Ephesus, were in like manner the subjects of the work of God in relation to the baptism of John. But this man Apollos is exceptional in the sense of being endowed with great powers, eloquence. He had evidently a mind for accuracy, most important, and I refer to him in the course of my remarks because of the need of being adjusted in every respect so that the work of God may not be hampered in any of us personally or in those whom we may touch or influence. If it is imperfect in me I shall certainly damage, to that extent, those whom I may touch or influence. Happily there were two persons in the audience listening to this man who knew the way of God. Thank God for that! The Lord speaks significantly about "two of you", @Matthew 18:19 and surely Aquila and Priscilla, though husband and wife, came under that head. How happy indeed if a husband and wife can be so classified. They are two, of course, although one in the inscrutableness of union God has set in the human race, but they were two of the assembly, these two persons. The mention of them in the Scriptures is equal, one before the other, three times the one and three times the other mentioned first, as if God would indicate how pleased He is with two persons who think aright, who think together, who are united in the testimony. And how He would use them. They were in this audience in the synagogue at Ephesus. One can understand how Aquila would look at Priscilla: That is good what that man is saying, but again he
{360}
would shake his head and say, That is not quite right. And so Priscilla would respond with equal intelligence and feeling, and hence they are both ready to serve this remarkable man, and surely, dear brethren, that is an important thing to be ready to observe the imperfections in persons in whom God is working, to observe the imperfections, and feel them and see that the persons are not damaged by them. Imperfections are standing in the way of the work of God and yet we can see that he is a subject in a remarkable way of the work of God, and such a man as is greatly needed in the testimony. We cannot afford to allow him to be damaged. We cannot afford to allow him to proceed with his service without seeking in the way of grace, in the way of God, to help him. And they would look at each other and would say, See how accurately that man quotes from Moses, see how accurately he quotes from the prophets. Being Spirit-taught man and woman they would observe how he could quote Scripture and with what force, for he mightily convinced the Jews; he was effective so far.
And hence as he finished, one can visualise the position, dear brethren, how these two dear people would get near to him and speak to him, recognising with feeling the work of God so far in him, but it says, they took him to them. I suppose they had a dwelling, they lodged in some house in Ephesus. I suppose they would invite him to their dwelling-place, their lodging; they would not challenge him in public before his listeners. They would take him, perhaps quietly, aside to their lodging and would with divine grace and feeling raise the question with this dear man and say, Now you see you said so-and-so, while you were speaking. We greatly enjoyed what you said and we can see that God greatly helped you, but you said so-and-so and you know, dear brother, that is not just right. Apollos would
{361}
listen, a subject man will listen. He will not defend himself; if a brother or brothers call his attention he will listen and look into the Scriptures. We see how these two dear people patiently instructed him and he would correspondingly patiently listen and subsequently patiently learn and become taught of God more exactly than he had been. Nothing that he had that was right would be lost, but rather be enhanced. Now he is clear in his mind and hence you observe that it is said, "When he purposed to go into Achaia, the brethren wrote to the disciples engaging them to receive him, who, being come, contributed much to those who believed through grace". Note that, dear brethren, through grace! For that is the way. "For he with great force convinced the Jews publicly, showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ". That was the great end. He would use the Scriptures now more mightily, more effectively, in that he had been taught more exactly the way of God, not simply the way, but the way of God. That is where the moral issue lies, that God had got a way in this world. He is on it. It involves teaching and it is a question not exactly of our feet literally, but our minds and our affections, how we travel, how we look at things, how we move on spiritually: it is in the way of God.
We learn in the beautiful teaching of @Numbers 10, that as Israel began to move in their first movement, the ark went before them three days¬ journey to search out a resting-place for them. And that is the idea as to the way of God. So God could say later that He had travelled with them in the tent, never asking for anything better, for love will go that way and that way was suffering. The power of God is in it, dear brethren, and the more accurately we know it the more effective we shall be. We shall not need much convincing if it is the real truth of God. So that Apollos is now taught, instructed in the way of
{362}
God more exactly and hence the brethren received him. There is no difficulty about him at all. Had he failed to listen to Aquila and Priscilla, we may be sure there would be no happy commendation of him at the next meeting, but evidently there was a happy commendation of this great servant, and so sensitive was he, so keen was he spiritually in regard of a greater servant, namely Paul, truly without rivalry of him, that when he heard of the state of things at Corinth, Paul says, it was not at all his mind to go now. Undoubtedly he was indicating that he had thorough sympathy with the lead that God was giving amongst the brethren. He would not be averse to Paul; he would be with him, and that, dear brethren, is the effect of grace in our souls that we are amenable to all this and amenable to the finest sensibilities and seemliness in the testimony, that we cannot afford to cross in any way the lead that God gives by His Spirit.
Well, finally in the passage in Mark, a well-known gospel passage, it is well to observe in this blind man the morally elevating power of the light that had come to him, how he was right, for what is recorded in our verses is, "And having heard that it was Jesus the Nazaraean, he began to cry out and to say, O Son of David, Jesus, have mercy on me". The peculiar touch there, dear brethren, is to be noted that he did not take up the appellation, 'Jesus of Nazareth', but 'Jesus, Son of David'. Who told him He was Son of David? He was a blind man. Is it not to call attention to the soil for the testimony that God particularly honours? He had brought about that soil. The great thread of the testimony has come down into his soul. It was not common religious reverence, but a truly exalted thought that he gave expression to, "O Son of David, Jesus, have mercy on me". And the Lord, as we have often heard, could call him and did, and we are told,
{363}
"Jesus answering says to him, What wilt thou that I shall do to thee? And the blind man said to him, Rabboni, that I may see". It is not only now the grace that is affecting him, but great intelligence is marking him. Where did he get this title? What does he mean by calling Him Rabboni? He is a companion of Mary Magdalene in this. As you know, she is looking backwards and she says, Rabboni -- Teacher. She had been with the Lord and learned from Him; this man had not been. What does he mean? Well, he means, or the Spirit of God means in bringing it to us here as it stands, that this man is a potential learner; he will learn, he learns subjection. He is ready to listen to anything that comes from Jesus, as Mary of Bethany too sat at the feet of Jesus and heard. This man would never question a right doctrine. He might not understand, but he would learn; he would give way to instruction. "Rabboni", he says, "that I may see". I will be one of Your disciples, that is what he meant. "And Jesus said to him, Go, thy faith has healed thee". He is going his way and that is the way to learn from Jesus, that is the way, and from no one else, not that Jesus will not use others. Those whom He would use were the apostles and we are told that the early converts continued in the apostles¬ teaching, indirectly Christ's teaching. The Lord is looking for this, dear brethren, in the gospel. If grace affects us the evident response is, Lord, I am going to be in your school. What influence the schools exert today over the children! The enemy is using them peculiarly to affect the children, but a true convert of the gospel will say, I want to be in the school of Jesus, the school of God, and that I think is what this man implied, "Rabboni, that I may see". He would read the Scriptures properly; he would read the book of Genesis properly when he gets his sight; he will read the book of Jonah and know that it is the
{364}
inspired writing of God. He will be proof against the insinuations of the devil in modem times. How essential, dear brethren, and especially for young people, that as grace affects us we refer to the Lord in this way. All teaching in a true sense must come from Him. It is divine teaching from whomsoever it may come, for it is indeed even the unction, "*Ye* have the unction from the holy one". He is the Holy One. Christ is the Holy One; God is the Holy One too. The unction is to bring in all that and make us independent of men's teaching.
And so this man is ready for all that is to come, and what a field is opened up to him, and hence he followed Jesus in the way. Of course it must be in the way if I am following Jesus, but that is not enough. The way is announced and so as one proceeds in the next chapter, you all know this way leads us into the most rich surroundings, Bethphage and on to Jerusalem, all the spiritual thoughts that centre in that territory, the way of God as the Messiah was entering into it. What richness of thought! What can the world afford as compared with the richness of thought that comes into the mind as one comes up from Jericho, and looks on that vista, that scene of divine interests, presently coming to view again, and this man is coming into all that. And as regards young people the Lord carries the thought on and He speaks in this gospel of a colt tied by the crossway -- that apparently is the word -- and the explanation that our translator gives us is, 'leading round the house', a very suggestive matter for young people and for parents in regard of the way, not out in the broadway where the motor cars are and the advertisements and plays and what not, where the world is thoroughly represented, but the way that leads round the house. Keep them near the house -- some scope, of course, for the young -- but keep them near the house. Let them not get away from it. The
{365}
Lord says, I need that one; you have kept him for Me and he is safe, I will take him now and use him. Think of being taken on by the Lord, the Lord knowing well what that discipline has meant to you, but you are now subject, and He says, I can use you. He is carrying the Lord into the city of the great King.
Well, that is all I had to present, dear brethren, I commend it to the Lord for blessing to us all.
{366}
"COME AND SEE"
@John 1:35 - 39,46; @John 4:29,30
J.T. It is the words, "Come and see", in these verses that I have in mind and their application today. God has helped us in the past here and elsewhere as to order and ornamentation in our gatherings with a view to the enhancement of what there is for Himself in the way of life, so that the invitation to anyone enquiring is, "Come and see". In the gospel testimony it is a question largely of what is presented for the ear to hear, but for the saints of God there is added the thought of what is to be seen in the place where God is known, where the divine presence is. These two disciples of whom we have read, are intended to be exemplary in this respect, for you notice that their interest is below the surface. They are drawn to Christ by the testimony of another; they are attracted to Him, but He would bring out what was in their hearts, what they sought. What they say is, "Rabbi" -- which, being interpreted, signifies "Teacher", and He says to them, "Come and see". This invitation to "Come and see" opens up much in our times, for the spiritual intent is that there should be something to see in the abiding place, for that is what they enquired about; they did not want simply to see the Lord, but where He abode. It brings up the question of our meetings which are all warranted by Scripture, our meetings for prayer, for preaching, for prophetic ministry, for readings so-called and, of course, the breaking of bread; these are all scriptural. Then the question comes up as to what is to be seen in each of them in any locality, for, in general, the divine Presence is there, but it is a question of what is to be seen.
E.G. Does the divine Presence being there call for order and ornamentation?
{367}
J.T. That was what I thought, whether there is anything in the sense of teaching, whether the Spirit is present guiding us into the truth. In the Established Church you could not say to an exercised soul, "Come and see", for what would he see?
W.C. Does the queen of Sheba illustrate your thought? She says, "I gave no credit to their words, until I came and mine eyes had seen". @1 Kings 10:7.
J.T. That is an outstanding illustration of the thing.
P.H.H. Are you thinking of the spiritual thing that is going on underneath the surface, behind the public side?
J.T. That is bound to affect what is to be seen: where the Lord abides, evidently in the sense of teaching, that is what was in their minds. The Spirit of God tells us what is meant by the word 'Rabbi'. It gives the thought of some sort of a school of instruction, a means of learning and teaching, the impartation of truth and the reception of truth. It is divine, the order which Scripture employs is divine, and not only is it right but there is power behind it.
E.G. Must we have seen where the Lord lay before we can enter into this?
J.T. That would help. He had been invited to come and see where Lazarus lay. These three scriptures, it seems to me, furnish instruction as to our meetings, what people may see when they come in, if they do come in. Firstly, as to instruction, teaching, the meaning of the word 'Rabbi' being given, and the idea of the abiding; and then secondly, the thought of good, "Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?". Well, "Come and see"! See if there is any good. Then, "Come, see a man which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?", the One expected. It is wonderful! "Is not he the Christ?"; "Come, see a man". It seems to me
{368}
that these three thoughts come into our meetings and are intended to be read into John's gospel to affect us as to what there is to be seen in these respects, whether in the way of teaching, or good, or the Person Himself.
F.K. Does @1 Corinthians 14 bear on this, a simple person coming in and falling down, "reporting that God is indeed amongst you"? @1 Corinthians 14:25
J.T. I think so. The presence of God was felt there and the apostle points out that it could not be so if one speaks with tongues. Naturally, men would think he was mad; we have to consider whether we are conveying any impression in our meetings which would lead to such a remark as that, that we are not quite normal.
A.B. We should approach the reading meetings in a spirit of dependence, recognising the Lord as our Teacher.
J.T. It is a question of how we behave at our so-called readings. Is the procedure calculated to affect an enquirer coming in? Are there conditions for the divine Presence? Can the Lord be there without being grieved in any way?
Rem. In the first chapter you have repeated three times over "which is, being interpreted", as if the Spirit of God is here as seeking to open up the truth.
J.T. Why not use the interpretation? It might be said, Why does the Spirit use the original word at all, and then tell us what it means? It is as much as to say, 'If you are on the line of learning I will explain what these words mean'. We ought not to use words people do not understand in our readings, nor should we pretend to be learned men, referring continually to the original. We should use ordinary language which people can understand. John would not puzzle anybody by his gospel; it is a 'simple page', but he brings in original words and tells us
{369}
what they mean. The New Translation helps us to understand, but there is no attempt to be learned.
Ques. Is it an occasion for the opening up of the truth and the Spirit is always available for that if our attitude is right for learning?
J.T. We should have in mind that the Lord desires to be with us and that there must be nothing which would jar on His spirit. If a man says, "Come and see", he means more than that you should see him personally; he wants you to see his house and his furniture and whatever else will enhance his glory, and that is what should be in our minds in sitting down together to read the Scriptures, that there should be in the furnishings nothing but what would enhance His glory, so that He can abide there. In this way it could be said, 'The Lord is amongst these people, there is something different from anything we have heard previously'.
G.W.B. In Acts Peter draws attention to John and himself, saying, "Look on us". @Acts 3:4 Were Peter and John samples of what the Lord had here?
J.T. They were conscious of being worth looking at in that connection, because the Beautiful gate of the temple was there. There was something there to attract the eye, but Peter's appeal, "Look on us" means more than that; he was referring to the persons themselves.
- R. Does "Jesus having turned" mean that He had respect to the spirit of enquiry found with them?
J.T. That is good. The Spirit of God stresses that such are worth looking at. The Lord valued them more than any person would. He would bring out what was in their minds and hearts and I am sure He would be pleased when they said, "Where abidest thou?" It points to the furnishings of the abiding place, those with whom He would surround Himself; such as in Acts, Peter and James and John and Mary would be there, and others with them, persons
{370}
thoroughly interested, whose attitude would enhance the position. They would not be sitting in a dull way or carelessly, but enhancing the position by their interest and attitude.
W.W. Why does John say, "These are written, that ye might believe"? @John 20:31.
J.T. That is the key to John's gospel, belief. If each one of us searches his own heart he will have to admit that he sins by unbelief, for active unbelief is sin, and the great point with John is to get believers. There were ordinary believers to whom the Lord could not commit Himself, those who were affected only by external things. He was aiming at His disciples believing, so we read in the next chapter, "This beginning of signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him". @John 2:11. Thus we come in chapter 20 to, "That ye may believe", @John 20:31 and He says to Nathanael, "Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou?" @John 1:50. He responded and so the Lord added, "Thou shalt see greater things than these". Such things are made known to believers.
Ques. Is the element of belief seen in the two disciples?
J.T. It went deeper than the surface. They wanted to see the surroundings where Christ lived, where He abode. The beginning of Acts corresponds with this: each one of those in the upper room was ornamental. They enhanced the position. It would do you good to look at them: if anything good was said their faces would shine.
P.H.H. Does belief bring us into the realm where these things are going on?
J.T. Yes, where persons are aglow with interest in the things of God it is active belief. Inactive belief is death; faith without works is dead.
Ques. By active belief do you mean an immediate response to what is presented?
{371}
J.T. Anything that is said that I have not heard before will stir me up and even if I have heard it before it comes home with fresh power to me if I am a believer.
F.C.H. In the epistle to Colossians the apostle speaks of "Your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ". @Colossians 1:4.
J.T. That is a remarkable statement -- the preposition 'in' implies active power.
P.L. Would the choice woods and precious materials in Solomon's temple bear on all this -- the glory filled it?
J.T. Just so. The glory that shines in the persons.
- C. Are you seeking to emphasise the need of right conditions in the assembly in view of active belief?
J.T. Yes, so that people who come in are affected, so that they say, I have never been in a meeting like it; it is not like one of the regular churches. That is the idea of "Where abidest thou?". What sort of surroundings are there? What kind of people are they, how do they go on? They are not ordinary religionists.
P.L. Is it love's obligation to furnish what is described? Lazarus at Bethany would have been one of them.
J.T. That is the idea. Lazarus was one of them. Think what a man he was! It is John's way to give you concrete cases.
G.W.B. The queen of Sheba says, "Happy are thy men! happy are these thy servants, who stand continually before thee, who hear thy wisdom!" @1 Kings 10:8, @2 Chronicles 9:7. Is that the impression a person coming in should get of the saints?
J.T. Quite so. Our meetings should not be doleful to young people, nor should they be too long.
{372}
The young people should come out happier than when they went in.
Ques. Has "the tenth hour" any reference to the end of this dispensation?
J.T. I suppose so -- the day running out, you mean?
Rem. I was thinking how the Lord is reviving all these things at the end of this dispensation and securing an answer to what was presented at the beginning.
P.H.H. One would desire to come to where the Lord abides in view of our abiding with Him. It says, "They saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day".
J.T. You mean they did not simply look in and leave. It is attractive. This gospel bears on that elsewhere. "Will ye also go away?" @John 6:67. There was holding power there where the work of God was. Peter says, "Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast words of life eternal". @John 6:68. It was a question of His Person, but here it is furnishings and order of the house.
F.K. They are together in @John 20 as believing persons.
J.T. That is it. Believing not only that He was the Christ but all that the message conveyed. They were characteristic believers. There was no discrepancy there save that Thomas was absent as he was not a characteristic believer. It was divinely ordered that there was no jarring note there, so it says, "Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord", @John 20:20 and then they are sent out in testimony. The testimony going out today is on that line, carried by inside believers, so to speak, those who believe all that is presented to them of the highest order of truth.
- R. Does it follow that one who has been on the line of 'seeing' has influence with his brother?
{373}
J.T. That is what you get here -- "Andrew the brother of Simon" is mentioned as finding his own brother.
Ques. You were referring to the Lord as Teacher and to the place where He abides. Is everything ministered from Him in that way from where He is?
J.T. Yes, from the highest point above.
Rem. In Elisha's day they were infidel as to the great truth of the ascension (@2 Kings 2:16).
J.T. It is well to bring that in here because our hearts are so infidel, if we do not watch them. We are only half interested or quite listless if faith is not operative with us.
P.H.H. The calling of the Lord "Rabbi" would mean that the mind is ready for fresh unfoldings.
P.L. Does the interpretation in each case convey a spiritual thought? Does it suggest that you have what is in mystery in measure? Is it a question of being initiated in that which theological language would not convey? It could not furnish words to convey these impressions.
J.T. I think that is so. It suggests the idea and in the books of the Old Testament you find out more about it. I suppose actually the word 'Rabbi' being interpreted is for the understanding of the gentile believers. And one hearing it would say, 'I should like to get some more words like that, words which were actually used by the Lord Jesus; are there any others?' Yes, there is another word which Mark and John use and that is 'Rabboni', and Mark knew other words too which the Lord used. I can understand a brother coming in among us from the denominations and asking, Are there any other books which enlarge on the Scriptures? Yes, there are books which help, and that is the way interested souls get on and heaven is delighted in interested persons. This book particularly follows up interest. Moses turned aside to see the burning bush, and God called
{374}
him by name, as much as to say, You are taken on now. The blind man called the Lord, 'Rabboni' -- that is to say, When my eyes are open, You are going to be my teacher (@Mark 10:51).
P.H.H. Manoah said to the Angel of Jehovah, "I pray thee, let us detain thee". @Judges 13:15. Does that spirit enter into this?
J.T. Quite so, and that of Gideon also: he asks the Angel to wait while he prepares him a meal. I suppose these thoughts are cumulative in Scripture, going back to Genesis.
Now, as to the next point; Nathanael is interested to know about 'good' (verse 46). He said, "Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?" and Philip says, "Come and see". It was a question now of good.
Ques. What do you connect with that particularly -- any special meeting, or what is among the saints generally?
J.T. Generally, I would say. It is an outside position, sitting under the fig tree, and the Lord sees him coming to Him. It is a question of walk; it had been the walk of the Lamb of God which had affected John, and now the Lord sees Nathanael walking. It is to bring out that the matter is now turned round; it is not what Nathanael finds in Christ, it is a question of what Christ is to find in Nathanael, because the setting here is finding. It is a question of the person who is coming to you, what the Lord sees in him, and the Lord names him. If persons come to the meetings on this line the Lord sees them coming. The walk from the house to the room is of importance in the light of this. The Lord sees what is going on; He names Nathanael here, "An Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile". @John 1:47. He was not doing much under the fig tree. He would not get help there, he was unbelieving there, but the Lord intimates to him that He saw him before Philip
{375}
called him, as much as to say, 'I know all about you', but it was *after* Philip called him that the Lord named him. He is now coming to see and if there is a work of God there it will show itself in genuine interest. The Lord today looks for what corresponds with "Come and see".
Ques. The Lord takes the initiative in finding in this paragraph. Do you get a sense that whatever material is brought the sovereign work of God is beneath it?
J.T. If you are used in a gospel meeting to help a young person, the Lord has been there before you. That thought should sober us as to lengthy appeals in the gospel. The Lord must have been there before if we are to effect anything. All Philip said was, "Come and see". He is not pleading anything. He says, "We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the law, and the prophets, Jesus ... who is from Nazareth". @John 1:45. That is all. You go back as far as you can in the Scriptures when you talk about Him.
G.W.B. Are you applying this also to conditions amongst the saints?
J.T. It is rather now the condition in the persons who are interested, what God is doing in them, what the brethren can see in them, are they worthy of consideration? If we are speaking about our meetings and what is to be found there we do not want to add anything to it which might mar it. The Lord looks for suitability. The Lord discriminates everything and He says of this man, "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!" @John 1:47. He is fit for fellowship.
P.L. Is all this a set-off against attempts to explain our position in a mental way, thus making people more misty? It is urgent that they should get impressions of God among us.
J.T. If a soul is not affected by God, he will go away from our meetings and say, I did not hear anything much there. That will be the case if the
{376}
Lord is not working with him, but the question is, What can we see in him? That is the way the thing works. Is there anything in him that the brethren can take notice of, that they can follow up? "An Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile". @John 1:47. Nathanael was a transparent man. The Lord was virtually commending him for fellowship. What a good case he is! Then the Lord challenges him; He says in effect, 'Why did you believe?' There are greater things ahead for him. He puts the matter so that the man is standing on his feet as a man of faith.
P.H.H. Does this at all suggest the scrutiny of the Lord in the Revelation, taking account of the different assemblies?
J.T. Yes, and this case is an example for us. We do not want to puzzle or baffle people who are interested; we want to put them on their feet.
P.L. The soul is held to Him by His own personal dealings and that affords a foundation for the assembly.
J.T. The "thou" in @John 1:49 is emphatic. "Thou art the Son of God". @John 1:49. It is not a question of other people, but 'You are the one'. Nathanael says, 'The real Person is there'. He presents the idea of one coming into fellowship.
E.B. Do we see that kind of service in Barnabas? He introduces Paul to the brethren.
J.T. Barnabas was an unjealous man. I would like him to come and see me if I were asking for fellowship! He would make a man of you.
G.W.B. Would Nathanael's question, "Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?" constitute a challenge to mere orthodoxy?
J.T. An orthodox churchman would say, 'What good can come out of these brethren?'
P.H.H. Angels ascending and descending upon the Son of Man, is that a suggestion of the deity of Christ?
{377}
J.T. Yes, ascending first, everything proceeds from Him administratively.
The third thing is "a Man" -- "Come see a man" (chapter 4:29). This is a first-hand witness, for the woman says, He "told me all things I had ever done". Every really converted person is a first-hand witness for he or she can speak of what happened to them.
P.H.H. Does this continue the thought of transparency?
J.T. That is right. She was not afraid now for all her past history is dealt with. No matter what they say when she asks for fellowship, she would say, You can say anything about me, nothing is too bad. She would be held by the Person of Christ. Anyone who had been searched as she had, would not be offended by anything that might be said, however hard. What could be said too bad if she looked back over her past history?
Rem. "Who has given me power ... who before was a blasphemer and persecutor, and an insolent overbearing man". @1 Timothy 1:13.
J.T. Yes, you could not say anything too bad about "the chief of sinners", could you? What is in mind is what the Jews will be in the last days, flesh of sin working out in its worst character. So Paul is a delineation of them, of God's long-suffering as shown to him.
F.K. Does Rahab in Joshua represent the idea? She abides in Israel until this day.
J.T. She stays. If God is working with anyone who comes to see among us, such an one will be held.
A.McG. Is this woman characteristically like those in @Psalm 68? She would be a subject woman. "Great the host of the publishers". @Psalm 68:11.
J.T. That is so. She would not be a troubler of the brethren, because you could say anything to her,
{378}
and she would not be turned aside, and you should not be turned aside either by what people say, or by the sight of others turning aside either, because you should think to yourself, I might have been that person. If you think of "Simon the leper", @Mark 14:3 he *is* a leper; that is his history and how can that man throw stones? We should save one another a good deal of trouble if we searched our own hearts. We *all* know what sin is, we have *all* had to do with it. We are not easy on young people and those asking for fellowship because we are not easy on ourselves. To be easy on them is not to be a friend to them. He "told me all things I had ever done". The searching power among brethren is a testimony to Christ.
Ques. You have no desire to blot out that page from your history. That the Lord knows all the details of our lives is a thought which should be maintained in our souls?
J.T. If we are honest men and women we would not deny it. If someone says something hard about us, well, the Lord has said the same thing too; that is the basis of our fellowship.
W.C. Did the woman wash her robes in accepting what the Lord said about her (@Revelation 22:14)?
J.T. She was morally cleared.
G.W.B. The good news to Samaria was brought by four leprous men; they would disarm prejudice.
J.T. Quite so. We are to be always repenting sinners if we are true men and women; we have learned how to repent.
P.H.H. The thing having come out, is it a highway morally to the service of God? He spoke of worshippers in @John 4. Does the Lord touch us morally in that sense in order to secure us in purity for His service?
J.T. Quite so. He speaks about worship to her after she had discerned Him to be a prophet.
{379}
Rem. That was seen in @Luke 7. The woman was a sinner but she anointed Christ.
J.T. "Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much". @Luke 7:47. The Lord knew them all and He did not shield her a bit, but neither did she seek to be shielded.
{380}
PERSONS GOVERNED BY THE TRUTH OF THE MOMENT
@Matthew 20:29 - 34; @Matthew 21:1 - 16; @Acts 9:32 - 40
J.T. These verses in @Matthew 20 show that the blind men were governed by the particular truth at the moment in confessing the Lord as the Son of David; and chapter 21 shows how the thought is carried on in the crowds. In verse 9 the crowds who followed cried, "Hosanna to the Son of David". Then the children in the temple, in verse 15, were crying, "Hosanna to the Son of David". There is no evidence that there was any collaboration between these persons, but they all strike the same note; and it conveyed the truth governing the time, having expression even in children, and suggesting the need of keeping them in mind in ministry of the truth. God is working, and they will respond as the elders do.
Then in the Acts we have the corresponding thought in regard to the ministers, as subject and walking in the Spirit and moving in the light as God gives it. The testimony is about to take the form of administration in localities; so Aeneas was to make his bed for himself, which thought is enlarged in the subsequent ministry of Paul. And then we have the thought that there should be living conditions in localities. That is what I had in mind; what have you to say to that, Mr. Coates?
C.A.C. Was it in your mind that there is some particular truth which would govern the position at any time?
J.T. Exactly. The Lord about to enter the city of the great King is owned, as it were, instinctively; for these blind men could not have had much instruction as to Him as the Son of David. And then the
{381}
multitude take up that note, and the children, as if it were a flowing current.
Ques. It this the practical result of the first verse in this gospel, "Book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David"? @Matthew 1:1.
J.T. That is very good. Matthew mentions two blind men; Mark and Luke only mention one. It would be to stress the thought of the testimony, which is in keeping with Matthew's line. The Lord accredits the line of truth as confessed by these two witnesses.
C.A.C. Is there an application of the Son of David to us particularly?
J.T. I think so. The Spirit of God refers to David in the prophets, and in the book of Revelation He introduces David. It seems to me that David's ministry enters into the last days in the sense of the service of God. The Revelation would contemplate him as having a place in relation to the thing in the most refined way. He says, "*I* am the root and offspring of David". @Revelation 22:16. As if in our day the reference would be understood. Why should it be said to the assembly? It is that Paul's economy is in mind. The things of God are developed in localities, but in unity; for the seven assemblies are addressed, and the Lord evidently, in saying, "*I* am the root and offspring of David" @Revelation 22:16, refers to the intelligent at the end. And in relation to the remnant of Israel He will also serve as David, not as Solomon but as David. In the later chapters of the book of Ezekiel we have David as king and as the prince and as the shepherd; so it seems as if David has a great place in the assembly in the sense of the feature of Christ which he represents; the Lord says, "*I* am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star. And the Spirit and the bride say, Come". @Revelation 22:16,17. The Lord is appealing to a high note at the end; that would be understood.
{382}
C.A.C. It seems to me very important that we should get the divine thought in that presentation. Would it be that Christ as David is, in one sense, greater than what He is as Solomon?
J.T. That is what I understand. The New Testament would bring that out very strikingly. Solomon is somewhat discounted in the New Testament, while David is greatly stressed; which I think would mean that we have in our dispensation the highest thoughts of God developed in what David stood for. The Lord speaks to the assembly as having his key, and as being the Root and Offspring of David. The saints of the assembly have come to an understanding of Him in that sense.
Ques. Does Paul's remark to Timothy, "Remember Jesus Christ raised from among the dead, of the seed of David" @2 Timothy 2:8 fit in with this?
J.T. That conveys the thought; it is in the last days. It is strikingly presented in the prophets as to the last days of Israel, and in the Revelation as to the last days of the assembly. The Root of David is John's gospel, and the Offspring of David is Matthew.
Ques. Would that suggest the full scope of the truth?
J.T. Quite so. The Root of David would be John's gospel, because that is where Christ is seen as the Son of God. The Lord addressing the assembly in that way suggests that there is an understanding of what it is, so that the Spirit and the bride say, "Come". The highest possible intelligence enters into that word "Come", when the Holy Spirit and the bride say it at once. There is hardly a more intelligent expression in Scripture than that.
Ques. Would that be to take up His kingly position?
J.T. That is the general idea. His coming for us is not so much spoken of. In Matthew we get, "Behold, the bridegroom cometh"; @Matthew 25:6.
{383}
it would have in mind that He would take up His rights here; and of course from the depths of our hearts we say it. As time goes on it is more and more evident that it is needed.
C.A.C. I suppose David would suggest the accomplishment of the whole will of God.
J.T. Were you thinking of @Psalm 89?
C.A.C. Yes. Would this aspect of the truth lead to the establishment of God's will in the assembly?
J.T. I should think that would be the effect of it. It seems to me the Lord is helping us in meetings such as these when the Spirit of God brings these things before us. The Lord is putting in His claim for the young. One notices that all over the world. It is remarkable the number of very young people that seem to respond to the testimony. The Lord is putting in His claim that they should be for the will of God. So that we cannot belittle them, if God is working in their hearts.
Ques. Why should such a thought come from these two blind men?
J.T. I think they are a figure of Israel, but not as representing the teachers of Israel; they are not of that class. Nicodemus would hardly say this, or if he did it would be as having read and known something of the prophets; but these men speak instinctively. However much we may know, if God is not working, there is no permanent result at all, but where God is working it does not fall to the ground; it is carried forward.
In the next chapter the crowd carry on the thought, and finally the children in the temple. And there the Lord Himself refers to the Psalms, and in verse 5 there is a reference to what Zechariah said, "Behold thy king cometh to thee, meek, and mounted upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass".
{384}
Ques. Would that suggest the importance of taking account of the prophetic word amongst us?
J.T. I think so. In the early days when the revival began, the prophetic word was the great theme. We are impressed with the much ministry on prophecy in early days. Now the Lord is calling attention to it again but more in the sense of its being brought to our consciences. Of course it always had that effect, but particularly now.
I think it is very interesting that Matthew gives us these remarkable incidents, these two men, and the ass and the colt, and then the multitude bearing testimony, and finally the children. It is a remarkable development. The Lord is bringing the truth down to the young, and calling them, as if He were saying, Even if I do come it is not that I have not material to go on with. Some seem to think that the use of young men and women means that the Lord is coming soon. I think it means that He has material to go on with. Rachel's wail for her children is very striking, governing the whole book in a way. Rachel would mean Israel; she says, Because they are *not*, but Matthew means to convey the thought that there will be children. The children and young people used to be rather minimised in their importance, but it seems to me that the Lord is working particularly in them now; and I think Matthew has that in mind, because he goes on to say that their angels do always behold the face of their Father in the heavens. So let us not despise one of these little ones.
There was an attack on them here, and they will suffer now.
Ques. Does the Lord stress the quality of what is produced?
J.T. Quite so, because they are saying this in the temple. And the priests here want to attack Christ. They were indignant and said to Him, "Hearest thou what these say?"
{385}
He had heard them. Nobody attacks the blind men, or the crowds, but the priests here attack the children for saying that. It seems to me that that fact brings out the importance of their testimony, and how the Lord hears it Himself, and He defends them: "Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?"
C.A.C. There seems to be a fuller result in the children than in the others, "perfected praise"; you could hardly surpass that. Would you look for a greater result in those brought up in connection with the testimony; they have not been corrupted by evil associations? Should there be a result for God specially in such?
J. T. It is really the best potential material that one can get. I am very impressed with what I see, that the Lord is putting in His claim to young people, and this passage shows that in even young children there was ability to take up the current note of the Spirit.
- R. The children were in the temple.
J.T. That roused the ire of the priests. We ought not to be afraid to hear the little ones take part in the assembly, though of course there is what is seemly.
- R. Is there a beautiful type of this in Samuel?
J.T. It is an example of what we are speaking of, one who grew.
Ques. Why does this follow the Lord exercising authority?
J.T. It is in a group of circumstances. These scriptures depict a scene of great thoughts. Brethren will observe the prepositions in the beginning of chapter 21. That would indicate objectives to be reached in the section. We are of little account unless we have definite objectives before us. And this is a scene of great thoughts. Jerusalem is the
{386}
great objective; they drew near to Jerusalem. Then we have Bethphage, another objective; then the mount of Olives. Then with these objectives in mind how is the testimony to reach them, not only how am I to reach them, but how is the testimony to be carried through intact. And that is what I think is in mind in the ass and the colt: there are two of them, so that the testimony is carried through.
The Lord is introduced to the blind men as Jesus of Nazareth, but they cry out, "Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David". The word, 'Lord', is used several times in this paragraph. In Mark it is Rabboni, as if to say, When our eyes are opened we will read the ministry, because He is to be our teacher, and we will learn everything that is to be learnt of Him. So what these two blind men say is to be carried forward, and the ass and the colt are used for that purpose: the old brothers and the young brothers are to go forward together in support of the testimony.
Ques. Is this a great movement, from Jericho to Jerusalem?
J.T. The man who went from Jerusalem to Jericho fell among thieves, but that is not here; all is triumphant. There are enemies around to take away what is there, but the testimony goes on to Jerusalem triumphantly, and is celebrated by the children. It is the Lord's own thought that it is to be carried through by such instrumentality.
Ques. Are not the features that mark the children essential? "Except ye be converted, and become as little children". @Matthew 18:3.
J.T. There is a good deal of that needed. Our gospel meetings ought to have that in mind, that the brethren might be converted. We cannot go on if we do not become like little children; because in that passage they were vying with each other in who should be greatest, and the Lord says, "Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter".
{387}
Ques. Is it instructive that the word rendered, 'perfected' in this quotation from @Psalm 8 is rendered 'established' in the psalm itself?
J.T. If a thing is perfected it is morally established.
Ques. What does "perfected praise" mean?
J.T. I think it is the genuine article. We are what we are. In heaven you are not there on sufferance; you are there because of what you are. There are no feelings unsuitable to the place. If praise is perfected it is established.
Ques. Have you in mind that God in working has been waiting for this moment?
J.T. It must have been a joy to the Lord to have it brought up in this setting. He brings in this word from the psalm, "perfected praise".
Rem. We have certain lines of testimony rendered which should greatly affect our praise and be in accordance with it.
J.T. Our hymns of praise ought to reach the fulness of the truth -- our relationship with the Father and with the Son.
Ques. Would it be right to say that David's earlier exercises were the reason of his being so successful?
J.T. Yes, he was commanded to play, and music seems to characterise him. He is the sweet psalmist. That must have entered into the word 'perfected' in the Lord's mind. It was a sweet note to Him then, because He alludes to the psalm.
Then the other scripture seems to show that in relation to new phases of the truth, those who are serving in the ministry anticipate it. They are equal to it. They are not challenging it, not contending against it. So that in the first instance, in @Acts 9, Peter is passing through all quarters; it means that
{388}
he is moving freely, not centred in Jerusalem. And he finds at Lydda a certain man, Aeneas, who had been eight years paralysed. He tells him, "Jesus, the Christ, heals thee: rise up, and make thy couch for thyself". I think it anticipates what Paul is about to introduce. Peter is not going to contend with that principle; and I think it is a word for all who minister, that we should be ready for anything, by whomsoever it may come. So this word means that the man who has been paralytic for eight years would now be able to do something in the locality; he is material for the assembly.
Then Tabitha, or Dorcas, is another similar case. She is not paralysed, she is a worker, but working in such a way as to command natural sympathy and praise. It was not exactly spiritual. Much may be done other than what is spiritual. The point is to have spiritual conditions in the assembly.
Ques. Would you say why it is Peter?
J.T. I think it is because he is the minister of the circumcision. And we see in chapter 8 that the apostles remained in Jerusalem when the others had left, but why did they stay there? The Lord had told them, "When they persecute you in this city, flee to the other". @Matthew 10:23. In this chapter we hear of Paul's conversion, and Peter instinctively moves out. Paul would not yet be able to convey to Peter what his doctrine would be, but Peter must have got it from the Lord instinctively. He is not going to be against what Paul is doing.
Ques. Are we to understand that Aeneas and Dorcas are suitable for Paul's ministry?
J.T. Yes, for the local company. One has to be able to do things for oneself, not waiting for gifted brethren to come along and put things right.
C.A.C. Is there a possibility of looking to the Lord to do things which He is requiring us to do?
{389}
J.T. I am glad you mention that. Many a time the Lord would say to us, You do it. What your hand finds to do, do it with your might. The man who had been paralytic was in a condition that always looks to other people to do the thing, now he is to do it himself. He is to be a man who can do things in the locality.
{390}
THE CONTINUANCE OF THE WILL AND SERVICE OF GOD
@Ezekiel 11:16; @Nehemiah 8:9 - 12; @Acts 16:25 - 32
The object in reading these scriptures is to bring out how the will of God and the service of God may be carried on in spite of the most difficult circumstances in which the Lord's people may be found. In 2 Timothy we are told from the outset the difficult character of our days. "Difficult times shall be there", @2 Timothy 3:1 not 'are here', but "shall be there", and they have come, so difficult that many hesitate to go on on account of them. Whereas these scriptures among others show that this attitude should never, and must never, be taken up by us. Not only the will of God, in the ordinary sense of the word, but the service of God must be carried on. Of course the service is included in His will, but the expression 'will of God' may be used, and rightly used, as less extensive than the service of God. The will of God is made much of by itself: "The world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever", @1 John 2:17. Can we assume that there are those who will abide for ever who do not in a practical sense do the will of God? It would be very precarious to labour under such an assumption. Normally a christian seeks, yea loves, the will of God. As he develops in the truth he discovers the difficulties, not only externally, but internally. Many suffer from the latter more than the former, and hence the necessity for that wonderful analysis of @Romans 7, so that we may see how our internal difficulties are dealt with by God so that they should not hinder us in our progress.
As we master the analysis of @Romans 7 (not only the verbal description of it, but what corresponds
{391}
with it inwardly) we say with thanksgiving, "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law". That is the point reached; and no one is worthy of the name of christian who has not reached that point. "*I myself*" -- a peculiarly individual experience. It is a resolve as before God, having mastery over the mind, that great faculty which God has given to us, and the resolve is to use it for the doing of the will of God, the serving of God's law, whatever that may be. Thus one sets out on his career as a christian in the full sense of the word; he is in accord with Christ, who said that He delighted in the law of God -- *delighted* in it: it was in His heart. And so one proceeds; it is not an irksome path, if you delight in it; there is nothing irksome in what you delight in. And all the divine Persons are available to help, so that there can be no slackening or complaint.
We have, further, the renewal of the mind; it is kept fresh. So that the path, the outlook, is inviting as thus viewed, and we prove that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. There is nothing at all in these statements to discourage, but all is inviting, normally. So that the believer's path shines, as we read in Proverbs, more and more "until the day be fully come". @Proverbs 4:18. It is not far off.
It is a most attractive path, that is the path of the will of God. Nothing really, dear brethren, is more to be coveted than the sense of being pleasing to God. We can understand that such a path as is indicated in Romans would not entail impossibilities. Our scriptures show that the will of God may be carried through in the midst of the greatest difficulties, what the Spirit of God speaks of as "difficult times shall be there". @2 Timothy 3:1. We say, Difficult times are here. There never was a day, I believe, of more difficult circumstances than ours.
First, in Ezekiel we get what God is to one in the path of His will -- "a little sanctuary". God can be
{392}
that. A big sanctuary too, of course, but He comes down to what is common with us, our littleness. We constantly hear such expressions, sometimes perhaps not too sincere; but however little we may regard ourselves to be, God says, I can be just as little. The power of compression in divine Persons is one of the most interesting things in Scripture. Time would fail to enter into that subject, but the ark of the covenant suffices to remind us of the power of compression in divine Persons. One would hesitate to use the language of Christ, that the Spirit uses in the psalms as to Him. They are written for us, for the spiritual mind to feed upon, and no one can really be little according to the will of God save as nourished by that food. As one of the greatest servants, Paul, said: "Less than the least of all saints". @Ephesians 3:8. I confess I can hardly understand Paul saying that, nor do I profess to understand the Lord Jesus saying prophetically in @Psalm 22:6, "I am a worm, and no man". I speak with the greatest reverence in quoting that passage, but think of Him saying that, think of the power of compression to feel such smallness and yet God over all abstractly!
So that this passage in Ezekiel is intelligible, as God says, "Yet will I be to them", those who were scattered abroad in all countries, "as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come". The suggestion is most touching, as indicating what God can be to us. Time would fail, again I say, to touch on what God can be to His people, whether individual saints or many together. It is a great thing to have in mind day by day what God can be and proposes to be and promises to be to His people, and this is one of the most interesting touches, that He can be "a little sanctuary" to us. How many of God's people are scattered and have no thought of a sanctuary at all, perhaps excusing themselves that they are too far away from the meeting places of the saints
{393}
where God is worshipped, and they content themselves in distance. But God says, I will be something to you if you cannot get to where the saints are, as is contemplated here, "scattered ... among the countries", away from God's sanctuary so loved by Ezekiel, and all the saints. God says, Wherever you are, I scattered you, I know where you are; wherever you are, I will be that, a little sanctuary. So that you will never fail to have means of worshipping Me. I can come down to your littleness and be a little sanctuary to you.
Many other things, as I said, might be added. I only touch on this to show how God provides for us in the maintenance of His will and service in these difficult days in which we are, and I read in Nehemiah just to point out how this principle was realised and carried out in his day, for instance. In Daniel, too, it was carried out in Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, Daniel's contemporaries. How a saint like Daniel, separated from his people, "scattered ... among the countries" as it says in Ezekiel, opens his window three times in the day, not once or twice, but three times, showing the thoroughness of the matter in his mind: "His windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime". @Daniel 6:10 He did the will of God. He served God, and we are told that he continued until the days of Cyrus, which is a suggestion of continuing for ever.
Daniel would suggest to us how we may go through. The point is to get through, not in any way, but in a divine way according to the will of God. So we find in the book of Ezra that they set up the altar because of the enemies; that is, the enemies afforded difficulty, great difficulty, but instead of hiding in the dens and caves of the earth as others had to do they set up the altar of God! You might
{394}
say that altar would not stand a cannon ball. Of course not. But faith is not reckoning on those lines at all. What faith is reckoning on, as the will of God is done, is the protection of God that is there. That is the thing. Let it be armies and navies unparalleled, dear brethren, the will of God is going through. And the example here is that in spite of the enemies, these returning saints in Ezra set up the altar. Where? Anywhere? No, on its base, according to the will of God. Not anywhere. They are not now scattered in the countries, they are in Jerusalem, they are where the altar base is, and the altar is to be set up. And that is what it is today, meaning that we sacrifice. The will of God requires sacrifice, and that is the idea of the altar.
And then they proceed to carry out the requirements of the months of the ecclesiastical year, the spiritual year, for that goes with the will of God. Not the lunar or ordinary conditions here, but the spiritual year. That belongs to God; He has His own year, and they betake themselves to *that* year, and they hold the feast, the set feast of the Lord. They might have said, The time is not yet for these things, we have not got a house, the house is not yet built, or even the foundations of it laid. But the altar is there, the sacrifice is there, the hearts of the saints are manifestly in the thing. And hence the feast of tabernacles is held. The feast of tabernacles means, among many other things, that we love one another, we want to be near each other, in our houses, wherever we may be. Distance is abhorrent to love. The feast of tabernacles affords the opportunity for the exercise of love. And they had that feast, and all that entered into that feast, and the sacrifices; and the new moons, too. The new moon is not determined by man or his laws down here; it comes round in its time; as the sun rises, so the new moon comes in its time.
{395}
Well now, further, the building of the wall was another matter of great importance. The angel Gabriel tells Daniel that at a certain time in seventy weeks the street of the city and the moat or trench (or whatever it was that protected the city -- possibly something more suitable for protection than a wall) should be built again, "even in troublous times". @Daniel 9:25. In troublous times. We discern what these things mean, dear brethren, as we are in the circumstances ourselves. How much have I built in troublous times? How often one might excuse oneself and say things are so difficult with me. God says the defence of Jerusalem, the moat or whatever it was, and the street of the city would be built in troublous times. The thing must be done.
And so Nehemiah has his part in all this, in the days when they had a sword and the implement for building at the same time, the enemy ridiculing them, ready to pounce on them at any moment without notice, but the building went on and went on, and it was completed! It was a question of the will of God, whatever the difficulties.
And then as to the passage read in Nehemiah I also wanted to point out the importance of brethren fulfilling the will of God and maintaining spiritual cheerfulness. Continual depression is no testimony to God. And so the ministry of the word is another thing that comes into these meetings that we have in different parts of the world. These meetings are seen in principle in this chapter. Ezra is the leading brother, and there are a certain number of brothers on his right hand and on his left hand. He is supported, which is a very important matter in these meetings. They are not a one-man affair. God is pleased to give a lead, and He is also pleased to give support. So you have two groups of brothers supporting the minister, supporting Ezra. And then the governor himself, Nehemiah, is joining in, not assuming
{396}
to be a leader, but just a helper. A very happy thing when a distinguished man does that as God so orders it.
Well, that is what we get here. We read in verse 9 that Nehemiah and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites, said unto all the people, "This day is holy unto the Lord your God; mourn not, nor weep". And it goes on to say, "For the joy of the Lord is your strength". This is an important passage for holy convocations such as the present. It is not a time for depression or sadness. There are times for these things. There is a time for everything. But what is in mind now is the positive side of our position, what God affords us in the way of *joy*. He says, *I* am full of joy. "The joy of the Lord is your strength". See what He does for us! He imparts that spirit to furnish us inwardly, to strengthen us and fit us to face the chilly blast of the north wind. We need it. It is not simply that we get instruction in these meetings. The point is that they are holy convocations in which God has pleasure and He imparts His own joy, the positive side of our position.
We were speaking recently about the silver trumpets in Numbers, how certain alarm blasts were to move the camps forward towards the east and the south; that is the positive side of things, the bright, cheerful, expectant side of things. Why should we not revel in it; God would have it so. God disengages Himself in these meetings to have part with us in joy. He loves His people; He loves them near Him and has positive joy in them, and He says, I want you to be in this. And that is what Ezra preached in @Nehemiah 8. They were weeping and mourning, but it was not the time for it. There was positive blessing, and they needed to be furnished to go out into the chilly atmosphere. The passage goes on to say, "So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved. And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them" (verses 11,12).
{397}
They were positively enjoying the thing -- God Himself embracing the occasion and imparting His own joy in His people to them! And the day was holy; there was no lightness, no natural lightness, which often marks these occasions, but *holiness*. These occasions are *holy*, and light talking and jesting are not convenient, to say the least.
Well, this important occasion in @Nehemiah 8 might be called a Bible reading; that is what it was. Ezra read aloud, supported by other brethren, and they all heard; the Levites and Nehemiah, the governor, coming into it to enjoin the people to be heartily glad. These are positive things. The blast of the trumpets in the wilderness says, Move towards the east; that is hope, that is joy, the prospect of the coming in of God. And presently in that movement room is made for the tabernacle. And what does it mean? It means that there are conditions for God. That is not in weeping and sadness, but in gladness, in the hope of His coming and all that is involved in that. God says, I can come in there, it suits Me. And hence the next movement brings the sanctuary. So that we have God's dwelling place in the sanctuary, where He is approached under these circumstances. It is a question of the testimony moving out and the saints moving out in a positive way towards the east and towards the south, enjoying God's gladness of heart in His people.
Now I would speak of the two men in the scripture in @Acts 16. Here are two men in the jail at Philippi, and in that position -- perhaps the most trying circumstances, almost comparable with that of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, they carry
{398}
on first of all prayer, the prayer meeting; that is not allowed to slip; secondly, the praise meeting, and that is not allowed to slip; thirdly, the gospel meeting, and fourthly, the Bible reading. All these (the latter, of course, is in the house of the jailor) are maintained in the most difficult circumstances. That is what I especially wish that the dear brethren here would have in mind, so that our hands should not hang down and we should not say, The time is not yet. One often hears such things. Only lately one has heard the remark, Too many meetings. Well, of course that is a possibility. But *I* have not experienced any such thing as too many holy convocations. If I say that, what does it mean? It means that I want to stay at home, perhaps, or maybe it is an outing. Understand, dear brethren, I am not whipping anyone, but see how readily we slip into these things and allow prayer to lapse. Maybe I am in a hurry to get to business in the morning and I neglect the reading with my family and the prayer. It is allowed to lapse without a conscience. Various excuses, of course; I must be there, or complaint will be the penalty. But then where God is working there is always a getting up early. Energy is needed. Get up half an hour earlier to have Scripture reading and prayer with your family. It may be we have a heavy Monday and do not go to the meeting for prayer! Well, they had a heavy day here, you know, but they *prayed*. And in prayer, they *praised*. That is, they had a worship meeting, a praising meeting. Heaven was not robbed. The jail did not rob heaven of its due. Why should I allow something to deny heaven of its due, to deny God of His due? These men are examples.
And then again, here is a man convicted of sin, and he says, "What must I do to be saved?" Never was a more concise and striking answer given to a repentant soul than was uttered by this voice in
{399}
prison, "Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved, thou" (second time) "and thy house". The man was in Paul's heart and Silas¬ heart. "Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved, thou" (again) "and thy house". That second "thou" is the basis really of all these things in the household. "Thou" -- the man is saved first, and then the household is brought in, showing how these men were superior to their circumstances and said just what that man needed. He had a house, and he was to be saved by himself first and then saved in relation to his house, and so he was. "He ... rejoiced with all his house, having believed in God".
And then fourthly, as I said, the word of the Lord, the Bible reading. It is the same thing. It is the Scriptures. "The word of the Lord" is to bring in from the Scriptures ministry conveying the authority of the Lord in the house, for that is what was needed. They knew exactly. So that heaven was not robbed, and the man was saved and his house instructed in spite of the difficulties.
There is no time to say more, but we are living in difficult times, but *urgent*. The more the difficulties, the greater the urgency to be up and doing. The will of God must go though, and His service must go through, and *we* must go through, for "he that does the will of God abides for eternity". @1 John 2:17.
{400}
THE ASSEMBLY BROUGHT TO CHRIST BY THE SPIRIT
@Genesis 24:50 - 67
J.T. I was thinking of this chapter as setting out the assembly, and also the Father's thought for the Son. At the outset it was said that it was not good that Man should be alone; there was no family as yet in @Genesis 2, but the counterpart was of Adam. And here you get the family link: the wife for Isaac was to be of the family related to Abraham and Isaac. As it says in verse 4, "Thou shalt go to my land and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac". @Genesis 24:4. So that we are at a high level. It seems to be greatly fitting the day, the first day of the week, for the Father is brought into it. He raised Christ on that day by His glory. It says, "By the glory of the Father", @Romans 6:4. It would go further than by His power. His affections were in connection with it, and the assembly undoubtedly was in mind. So that it is not only that she is of that family, but she has the graces proper to the assembly, answering to what the servant understood was needed. So that it is said of him that he was astonished. "And the man was astonished at her" @Genesis 24:21 -- astonished at *her*.
Then the chapter is full of worship on the servant's part. And I thought we might look at the closing paragraphs as showing the culmination of what is in mind in the chapter, that the assembly is led into a place, not her own properly, but which she is to grace in testimony, that is Sarah's tent. The word in verse 67, as no doubt most of us are aware, is 'led'; "Isaac led her into his mother Sarah's tent". As there, she becomes his wife. She is there in that position; she is there to be loved by Isaac, pointing
{401}
to the graces of the assembly seen in the early part of the Acts in testimony.
And it was further thought that we might notice Laban as an outstanding figure in the chapter. He is mentioned before his father in verse 50, and he is mentioned before his mother in verse 55. We may notice him in view of after-history and in view of such limitations as one such as he might impose on the progress of the saints, of the assembly. Because, although discerning the movement which came about as of God, he would have detained Rebecca. He and her mother say, "Let the maiden abide with us some days, or say ten; after that she shall go" (verse 55). I thought that perhaps we might be helped in seeing what marks Laban as definitely the leading personage in the house, which would be irregular, as the father is still there. Laban would have detained Rebecca. Are we conscious of anything of that character in regard to the movements of the Spirit of God in view of the assembly today?
W.W. What element are you suggesting that Laban represents today, did you say?
J.T. Well, you might say he is the leading man in the place, discerning what is the movement of God, but still he would hinder -- hold back.
W.W. You mean that there might be an element among the saints which would hinder the movement of the Spirit?
J.T. Yes, and perhaps the leading element, too. One having that place or who is mentioned in that way. Here Laban even received presents from the man, from the servant.
E.I. You mentioned subsequent history. Were you thinking of his transactions with Jacob?
J.T. Yes, quite so. This is the beginning of all that. You might say he was a good brother, you know. He was an active man. But he is mentioned first in verse 50 when they say, "The thing proceeds from Jehovah: we cannot speak to thee bad or good. Behold, Rebecca is before thee: take her, and go away".
{402}
That really was her father's part. If anyone spoke first it ought to have been her father. That is, it represents one who, whilst evidently recognising what was of God, was irregular. He was shutting out some other person who had a right to speak before him.
Ques. Is there a suggestion of indifference -- in what he says? "We cannot speak to thee bad or good".
J.T. Yes. You mean using the word 'bad'?
Rem. Yes. I wondered whether it was perhaps that feature that hindered us in assembly procedure.
J.T. It was not the time to introduce the word 'bad' at all, was it? It was a wonderful time. The servant of Abraham was astonished; he would not entertain the idea of badness at all. It was all brightness. Everything was proceeding as expected by Abraham, and the servant is worshipping all the way. But there is nothing of that kind with Laban.
J.B. Does it suggest that he was occupied with the outward adornment rather than with what was for Isaac?
J.T. "When he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister's hand" @Genesis 24:30. You mean that that moved him?
J.B. Yes.
J.T. Well, you can understand that. And he got something himself, too. The servant gave *him* something. "The servant ... gave to her brother, and to her mother, precious things" (verse 53). Bethuel, the father, does not come in for anything. So that it would be an advancement to Laban himself. I suppose applied typically to a leading brother, anything that would enhance the gathering would enhance *him*.
{403}
W.W. How are you regarding Abraham's servant in verse 52? "And it came to pass, when Abraham's servant heard their words, that he bowed down to the earth before Jehovah".
J.T. That is not the first time. At first it says he "was astonished at her, remaining silent" @Genesis 24:21. And then in verse 26 we read that he "stooped, and bowed down before Jehovah, and said, Blessed be Jehovah". @Genesis 24:26. That is because of Rebecca, because of what he saw in *her*. Then he says, "Blessed be Jehovah, God of my master Abraham, who has not withdrawn his loving-kindness and his faithfulness from my master; I being in the way, Jehovah has led me to the house of my master's brethren". @Genesis 24:27. A remarkable statement that, "the house of my master's brethren". I suppose it would be observed by us that his name is not given here. We have sung, 'Praises for the Holy Ghost'. (`191:3). I suppose in principle here it is. The Spirit keeps Himself out of view in the economy. He is much in view in the Scriptures, but He retires to make much of Christ. "He shall glorify me", the Lord says @John 16:14. He speaks of Christ. He speaks of God. He has taken a lowly place. So that in this chapter the man is just a servant in Abraham's house, over all that he has, without his name being given. You are struck with what is in the man. How he impresses you all through. So that in the end he tells Isaac. "And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done" (verse 66). He was doing much, but Isaac must know -- referring to Christ. The Spirit is equal with the Father and equal with the Son; there is no doubt about that in the abstract, but as to the economy, He has taken the most attractively lowly place.
E.I. So eventually the man speaks of Isaac as his master.
J.T. That is in keeping with the chapter. "That is my master!" the servant says to Rebecca (verse 65).
{404}
- S. You were speaking about the leading brother. Is what should characterise the leading brother seen in this man?
J.T. The servant is really a type of the Spirit, I suppose.
- S. I was meaning that. A true spiritual leading brother would take character from the Spirit.
J.T. Quite so. Laban here was in this matter, but as it has been remarked, he takes notice of the gifts, the adornment of his sister first. He cannot deny that it is of God, but he says, "We cannot speak to thee bad or good". Peter says as regards the gentiles coming in, "Who indeed was *I* to be able to forbid God?" @Acts 11:17. Well, Peter might have said much more than that, although we have to admit that he was defending himself before the Jews. The Holy Spirit fell on the gentiles as he was speaking to them, showing that God was thinking much more of them. So Laban does not say much here, but he uses the word 'bad'.
Ques. Would that help us in speaking, not only to say what is negative, but something good?
J.T. You would have something good to say to the brethren. I think that is the principal thing in ministry. Unless, of course, there is something to correct. There was not anything of that here. But should Laban have spoken at all? Why did not Bethuel speak? If we go back in the chapter we see how prominent Abraham is in all these matters. Sarah is dead, we know, but the wife's side is not brought in. Why was not Bethuel brought in? The servant would expect that it would be the father. In verse 55 the father is not mentioned. Where is Bethuel? Rebecca speaks of Bethuel; she says, "I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor" (@Genesis 24:24). She does not speak about the brother. It is the father.
{405}
Ques. What would Bethuel represent rightly in the assembly?
J.T. Well, it is the fatherly quality. Everything refers back to God in the assembly. All must proceed from God. So that the order of precedence must come into line. We have to discern where the fatherly qualities really are. Not merely the active brothers, but the father's activities in love. Paul says, You have many teachers. Some of them said of Paul that his bodily presence was weak and his speech contemptible. But, he says, you have only one father. So John also, he addresses the saints as children. I suppose it is a question of discerning where love is, because God is the source of all. "Of whom are all things". @1 Corinthians 8:6.
F.W. Laban does not seem to be more than what we should call an official.
J.T. He was an active man. But Bethuel was the father. You must make room for that.
E.I. Was it your thought that what subsequent history brings out throws light backwards?
J.T. Hence God says, "Jacob have I loved". He does not say that at the beginning; He says it at the end. "Esau have I hated" @Malachi 1:3, @Romans 9:13; He did not say that of Esau either at the beginning. It is a question of subsequent history. And what subsequent history brings to light is nearly certain to appear in some little way at the very outset. Here, the most serious matter is that her mother and Laban would have detained Rebecca.
F.W. It does not seem to give any reason for that.
J.T. That is just it. The servant says, "Do not hinder". He calls it *hindering*. That is a serious matter. For I am in company with Satan if I am hindering the work of God. "Satan has hindered us", Paul says @1 Thessalonians 2:18.
Ques. What about the mother?
{406}
J.T. She is hindering, too, but evidently Laban is the leader in the thing.
Rem. It emphasises the importance of recognising the element of the father.
J.T. Yes. It refers to the economy. The economy is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. That is the divine order. Not that They are not equal in Deity; viewed in Deity, They *are*. But in the economy the positions are given: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. And it is necessary that it should be so, so that love should work out. Hence Paul says, "Raised up from among the dead by the glory of the Father". @Romans 6:4. That really covers all that is taught in the book as to family relationships. Because we say, Abba, Father, in @Romans 8. We "have received a spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father". @Romans 8:15. That gives the position: we are sons. We come into all that glory.
W.W. It does not seem as if any of the relationships did very much here. The great matter was the work of the servant.
J.T. They are not exactly against him, except in the matter of hindering. "Some days", they say, and then they add, "or say ten" (verse 55). If they hinder ten, you see, you do not know what might happen. It is a breaking in on the mind of God.
W.W. The whole matter seems to be a question of the discernment of the Spirit. Everything else was hindering, whether passive or active.
J.T. Does it not remind us where it would lead to except for the Holy Spirit?
J.B. Is there the danger of being content to have all that comes to us as coming from Him to us, but seeking to stop short of going to Him, that is Christ risen?
J.T. Quite so; especially if the leading ones are not giving full place to fatherly qualities. Because
{407}
that is where the fatherly qualities are seen, in those who are prominent among us. Bethuel is on one side; he is not saying anything. He is not asking her to stay, but he is not saying anything. It is the brother and the mother. Satan is behind this, because he would hold us back from the full thought of the mind of God. Often young people are held back, and others, too. So that the great matter is to recognise the work of God. Do not hinder it. It is just to detain the maiden, without saying anything more. Why? *Why* should they detain her?
A.T.B. "And it came to pass, when Abraham's servant heard their words, that he bowed down to the earth before Jehovah" (verse 52). That was as no opposition was presented. One can see the service of the Spirit in securing the bride for Isaac. But the moment the hindrance is presented we see the resentment on the part of the servant.
J.T. When the hindrance is offered, he says, "Do not hinder me, seeing Jehovah has prospered my way: send me away, and I will go to my master" (verse 56). That is a fine speech! That is bringing God into it. It is God's work, typically. The assembly is here; there is no question about it. The graces of the assembly are manifested in Rebecca. "Send me away", he says. He will be faithful to his master. We want to get into that spirit, to learn from Him. The Spirit's way in regard of the assembly, that is what we get here, the Spirit and the bride. The servant, it says, was astonished. Not that one would say that of the Holy Spirit, but it shows how affected He was and how jealous He was that all that should be secured for Christ, typically. Do not hinder Me in that. So that we are not to be hindering. We speak of the care meeting; it really ought to be care for the work of God, to see that that is not hindered.
{408}
Rem. "And the king will desire thy beauty", @Psalm 45:11. We are allured from this scene as led by the Spirit, so that we are no longer earthly-minded but we become attached to Him in the Spirit.
J.T. So that the question is put to her. Very well that they allowed her to speak at all. "Let us call the maiden and inquire at her mouth" (verse 57). That is a beautiful suggestion. "And they called Rebecca and said to her, Wilt thou go with this man?" Not to Isaac, but "with this man". Typically it means the effect of the Spirit in others. Will you go with Him? And she says, "I will go". No hesitation at all. That is very important, the definiteness with which the work of God identifies itself with the Spirit. For at the very outset we have to do with the Spirit. New birth involves the Spirit; the work of God involves the Spirit; we have even the very words, "the love of the Spirit". @Romans 15:30. She was interested in this man. She says, I will go. So that itself is a testimony to the economy.
And "they sent away Rebecca their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men". So that all is settled now as regards Bethuel's house.
And then in verse 61 we see Rebecca in her movements, "And Rebecca arose, and her maids" (the first mention we get of them) "and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man". A very fine description! "And Isaac had just returned from Beer-lahai-roi" -- the well alluding to the Spirit again in another sense. For Christ is occupied with the Spirit, too. In truth all His relations with us are in the Spirit. Union is by the Spirit. The note says, 'came from coming to', showing that the thing was in his mind. As far as I remember it is in relation to Hagar that this well first comes into view, but now the Spirit of God instead of that is to be employed in relation to the assembly. Not Hagar but the assembly, that is Rebecca. She had means of refreshing
{409}
there where she was. It is the Spirit in relation to Christ.
And now this paragraph treats of Isaac and Rebecca. "And Isaac had gone out to meditate in the fields toward the beginning of evening. And he lifted up his eyes and, saw, and behold, camels were coming". It is not stated as if he was expecting them; the article is omitted. It is "camels were coming". "And Rebecca lifted up her eyes and saw Isaac, and she sprang off the camel. And she had said to the servant, Who is the man that is walking in the fields to meet us? And the servant said, That is my master!" That is all he says. He does not say, That is the man I have in mind for you. He leaves it there. How much of this enters into the antitype! What Christ is as coming from the well, to stress the importance of the Holy Spirit as essential to this matter, union, and all that enters into it. The servant says, It is my master! But He comes into view in the well, the resources that are necessary for her as to this great matter of union with Christ, both as to the union itself and the support, and the freshness that goes with that. For the idea is that she is never to grow old. The assembly comes down in freshness after a thousand years. The Spirit ministers to us on behalf of Christ. He is with us, too; He is by our side. And then you see the position of Isaac. He is meditating in the fields; he is not occupied with great affairs. It is Isaac himself personally outstanding. She says, Who is he? "That is my master"! That is all.
A.T.B. Who is the man in verse 61?
J.T. That would be the servant. "They ... followed the man". "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, *these* are sons of God", @Romans 8:14. And is it not very beautiful that when they come to Isaac, the servant having fulfilled his charge, he "told Isaac all things that he had done"?
{410}
-.M. It is interesting that the man retires at a certain point. Is there a point where the Spirit, so to speak, makes way for Christ?
J.T. Quite so. "The servant told Isaac all things that he had done". His mission is done. And now the idea is the position of the assembly as led by Christ. In @Luke 24 He leads the disciples out as far as Bethany; that would be in their own setting as the remnant of Israel. But this leading into his mother Sarah's tent would be another line, into Israel's place; It means that Israel is now regarded as out of the way by death, and the assembly is installed in that position. And that is where we are in these very days. So that the testimony is carried on. They will come into it later on, and we are in it now. The Lord has led us there. It is not in heaven. According to this she became his wife in Sarah's tent. And that is the position we are in now as I understand it. It is where we are loved, as if the Lord is pleased with what marks us here in the place of testimony. Assembly administration now would be in localities; not any longer in Jerusalem as a centre but in different localities. Peter is moved by that spirit, you know.
W.W. Instead of Israel being in that place, the assembly is there.
J.T. Quite so. And in that place she is loved. "And Isaac led her into his mother Sarah's tent; and he took Rebecca, and she became his wife, and he loved her".
Isaac is the heavenly man in testimony here. Abraham is distinctly the heavenly man, and Isaac is the counterpart of that, that is, the heavenly man down here in testimony. And so his bride is here in the place of testimony.
E.I. Would @Acts 9 be in keeping with that, where Paul is brought in?
{411}
J.T. Yes. So you get 'assemblies' -- the word in the plural -- in that chapter @Acts 9:31. "The assemblies then throughout the whole of Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified and walking in the fear of the Lord, and were increased through the comfort of the Holy Spirit". It is no longer Jerusalem, and Peter was in keeping with that. He opened the door to the gentiles in that light.
Ques. Does the feature of response mark Rebecca?
J.T. Yes, it is beautiful here. "She took the veil, and covered herself". Not only so, but "she sprang off the camel" (verse 64). There is a *spring* there. "And she had said to the servant, Who is the man that is walking in the fields to meet us? And the servant said, That is my master! Then she took the veil, and covered herself". So that she is equal to Isaac as she was equal to the man. She shines in both positions. When she gives water to the camels the man was astonished at her. Her grace shines here as there, only more fully. She covers herself.
A.T.B. Do you think it was the report of the servant that brought about all this wonderful movement?
J.T. Well, she is led on in it, but it seems as if everything that you see in her is of herself. The suggestion is the work of God in us. The whole book of Acts is to bring this out. Although there were some acts which were not the work of God, generally the whole book is to bring out the work of God, a very important matter. The work of God is always true to itself in the saints.
R.C. Would the service of Paul bear on it when he says, "I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ", @2 Corinthians 11:2?
J.T. Quite so. I think it does bear on it. And I think his statement of the Father raising the Son by the *glory* of the Father is very full. You can see the
{412}
glory of Abraham shining in a wonderful way in all this chapter. It is all his thoughts.
W.W. What about the comforting in verse 67?
J.T. It is all in testimony. Paul says in @Romans 9:4, "Who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the law-giving, and the service, and the promises". How much he shows belongs to them! He, of course, is expressing the feelings of Christ, how the Lord felt in all that becoming dead. Take, for instance, the new covenant; it belongs to Israel, but see its effect in the assembly! Greater, I believe, than ever it will be in Israel. It has taken a higher level. And the 'comfort' lies there. And hence what we are in our localities. It is a question of what we are in testimony.
Rem. "And Isaac led her into his mother Sarah's tent"; the assembly comes in in Matthew.
J.T. Quite so. I suppose that Matthew's gospel is to show how it took place.

*Pages 413 - 437 -- Two contributions from 'The Word Proclaimed' (preachings Nos. 31 and 4)*.
THE BRINGING TO LIGHT OF THE TREASURE
@Matthew 13:44; @Acts 13:4 - 7,12,52; @Acts 14:8 - 10
I intend to speak tonight, as seeking to present Christ as glad tidings, from the standpoint of His valuation of believers. This verse in @Matthew 13 speaks about a treasure, and the Lord likens Himself to a man who has found it. As coming into this world and becoming Man, great thoughts filled His mind. As Man He stood in relation to all men, and as Son of Man He inherited all that attached to man from the divine side. He did not inherit man's sins, but He took on these in due course, for they were a liability on the race. When Adam was formed he was free from indebtedness; he was set up by his Creator without any liabilities; but in due course he involved himself, and became heavily indebted. Christ, as becoming Man, took account of all this. He was "holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners", @Hebrews 7:26. One who "did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth", @1 Peter 2:22 and He was at any time at liberty to return whence He came, to go back to His Father. But we see Him at one time in the temple looking around, meaning that He was taking things into account as they were; and so in a wider way, He looked around in the world, and took account of everything, and began to act as One who would befriend this great debtor, One who would discharge his liabilities, his obligations. To do that He could not return to heaven without dying. This involved a great sacrifice on His part. Here He puts it in the terms of goods, or the value of goods: He does not value Himself here; it says, "For the joy of it goes and sells all whatever he has".
{414}
In order to do this He had to die, because the things that He had He inherited from God's side, and it was in dying that He surrendered them all, gave up everything that belonged to Him as a Man.
He inherited all that attached to man as in creation, and what belonged to Him as a Jew, as the Messiah. All these things were, as it were, 'sold', in order to get this new thing that was hidden in the field. Who hid it there is not disclosed. We are told in the Old Testament that "it is the glory of God to conceal a thing", @Proverbs 25:2. The mystery was "hid in God" @Ephesians 3:9; He kept it hidden for centuries. He did not tell Adam, or Noah, or Abraham, or Moses, anything about it; they were His friends, but He hid it. We are not told here who hid the treasure, but it was hidden, and the Lord pictures Himself as finding it. Of course, divinely He knew everything, but He became Man, and at times He limits Himself. No one else would limit Him but Himself; but He does limit Himself marvellously -- Here He speaks of Himself as in the position of finding something that someone had hidden, and, carrying the idea of limitation through, His thought was to get control of this field. You say He had control of it creatively. Well, He is limiting Himself in the figure here, which is needful in order to get the truth into our little minds. If God were to come down and attempt to speak to us from His infinite point of view, we could not follow; but He comes down to our little minds to get into them. It is in this sense that the Lord says that He bought the field; He sold all that He had, for it is a business matter, as I might say, and He bought the field. He had the wherewithal to do that, and He did it. He is not saying that He gave up Himself, but it is implied. It is to get one thought into our minds, that there is such a treasure in a field, someone having hidden
{415}
it there, and the owner of the field, of course, owned the treasure. The Lord is endeavouring to get this into our minds. So He buys the field, and hence can operate in it.
To use a further thought figuratively, if there were a gold mine in a man's field, or a silver mine, or oil, coal or other such things, he would operate it; whatever is in the field is within the claims of the owner of the field. But the Lord is not seen here as operating in that sense at all. There may be many other things in the field that are not hidden. A prospector would find all these minerals to which I have alluded, for some have great skill, even finding water hundreds of feet down in fields; but the Lord is not picturing that at all. What He has in His mind is this treasure which someone has hidden, and it is in a field, and He has acquired the supreme right to that field and all that is in it, and now He is to claim the treasure. To make the thing simple, speaking to believers, I would say, the treasure is ourselves, When God hid it there, it was potential, but He had the thing in His mind. It was a treasure, and He would use it in due course. And now Jesus pictures Himself as finding this treasure. You say, How did He find it? Well, He found Peter: he is one of the first He finds according to this gospel. Peter was a fisherman, and the Lord found him fishing, and He called him. Had I been there and known Peter previously, I might have said, Lord, there is not much there; I know that man, a swearer, a liar, a man who goes in for rough things! The Lord called him, saying, "Come after me!" That was the test; and Peter came after the Lord. The Lord said, I will make you something! Not all the universities in the world could make him what the Lord proposed to make him. He says, "I will make you fishers of men"! @Matthew 4:19. Later on He would
{416}
say to Peter, You are a stone: you are *Peter*! No geologist ever found such a stone as this. Never was such material found by any geologist as this. Well, I am only illustrating to you what this treasure is: Peter illustrates it.
I could go on and take up John and James in this way, for the Lord called them too, and they followed Him. John is another variety of this treasure; he is the most lovable of men. Sometimes natural men are lovely from an external point of view, even the man who went away from the Lord when He told him to sell all that he had. The Lord had been doing this, and He says to him, "Sell whatever thou hast and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me, taking up the cross", @Mark 10:21. He did not do that, but still the Lord looked on him and loved him. There was something to love in that sense, but it is only on the surface. The man who goes away from Christ in misery because the Lord tells him this is not lovable any more; but he was such a beautiful specimen of creation that it says the Lord loved him. But when we come to John, one of those early finds of Christ's, he is characteristically "the disciple whom Jesus loved". @John 19:26, @John 21:7 @John 21:20.
What I have said illustrates to you, I am sure, what this treasure means. It is varied, and the Lord says, Now, I want the whole right to this field, I have bought it! So He is not intruding upon anybody's property. You see, if I met you on the street, and gave you a little book about Jesus, you might turn away with disgust, and throw it on the side-walk, if you took it at all. Well, if you do that you are really in my mind disregarding divine rights. The Lord has bought you provisionally, not yet finally, because this purchase does not secure you eternally at all; it is provisional. He has bought
{417}
the whole race, you might say, to acquire rights over it just for a while, because there is something there that He regards as treasure. How much refuse you often see at the mouths of mines, mountains of useless stuff excavated for the sake of one little bit of gold! At Johannesburg they dig down six thousand feet for a bit of gold. There are mountains of stuff there, no good to anyone, but still, gold is there. These gold prospectors buy the land; they have a right there. That is the point. The Lord has something in His mind, and the next verse to the one we read in @Matthew 13 speaks of a pearl. That is *one idea*; the treasure may be varied. The Lord has that in His mind, and I am here tonight in a little way, as hundreds of others are in rooms like this, to bring these facts before people, with a view to getting some of this treasure for Christ. He is looking for it and He knows just what He wants. He knew what He sought for, and He found it. It was what He found illustratively in Peter. It is not a Jewish idea; it is another idea altogether, a matter of secrecy, having reference to the assembly. It is "the mystery", really. It is all a matter of secrecy, but there is definiteness to get the thing, and how great pains have been taken since the Lord Jesus died to acquire the field! The Holy Spirit Himself, the great divine Searcher, has come down, to preclude, in a way, any possibility of anyone escaping His touch. He strives with all. Paul, in order to make the matter clear, says, "For God is one, and the mediator of God and men one, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all, the testimony to be rendered in its own times", @1 Timothy 2:5,6. So it is that from that day to this the testimony is being rendered in order to get this out which the Lord found. He found it in Peter, James, John, Matthew, Bartholomew, Mary and thousands of others. It is something that was not there before; that is the way it is put. It is a find.
{418}
Now these passages in the Acts help us to see how the Lord was going about this matter. These servants, Saul and Barnabas, accompanied by John Mark, are sent out. The Holy Spirit had been down here with perfect first-hand knowledge of the whole race. Let no one think he can escape His search! The Holy Spirit is not locating you to judge you, He is seeking to get you in view of this treasure being secured. That is His business: He is a divine Person here on the principle of search. We read of the woman who swept the house for the piece of silver; it is a thorough search for the thing that is there. In @Matthew 13 the treasure is hidden carefully by somebody, and then found by somebody and carefully hidden again, and the whole field bought. So the Holy Spirit is down here on the principle of search. This little meeting is on that principle; the Holy Spirit is endeavouring to get somebody. The point of this meeting is to get some of this precious treasure for Christ.
So these men in @Acts 13 went off, sent by the Holy Spirit. They were not free-lances in their preaching, going where they would, but they are sent by the Holy Spirit. The point in His sending is that He knows where the treasure is which He is searching out. The Holy Spirit is a divine Person with first-hand knowledge of the whole position: He knows where to send people. It does not say here that the Lord sent them, but the Holy Spirit did so -- a rare thing; but it gives you the view I am presenting tonight. The Holy Spirit is operating as knowing the whole field, having first-hand knowledge of it, and He knows where are the varieties of the treasure.
The first man we get here is the proconsul; he is distinguished, a great man, as one of the Cabinet in London, the proconsul of the island. He is said to be an *intelligent* man: that is the point. He has
{419}
been to college, so to speak, and has learned the sciences. But the point is not what man had made him, but what God made him. He is said to be an intelligent man; that is not simply that he knows things, but he has the power to know things, the ability to recognise things and to value things. But he is at a great disadvantage -- this bit of gold, this treasure. We see presently that it is secured, apparently the only bit on the island! They went the whole length of the island, and the first man they met was Bar-jesus, a terrible thing! He speaks well, you say. But Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. His name takes up the thought of sonship, and he is doing all he can to keep the proconsul from the faith. Satan is not very far away from us tonight, but the more saints present at a meeting like this, the less power he has. If there is anyone here not interested, Satan has power with you. He is usually nearby when God is working, when He is gathering some of this treasure.
So Bar-jesus is set to turn the proconsul away from the faith. It says, "But Elymas the magician (for so his name is by interpretation) opposed them", -- that is, Paul and Barnabas -- "seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith". @Acts 13:8. I must not be too long in my definitions, but 'faith' here refers to the great christian doctrine. The doctrine of the gospel had already been unfolded, and now was being preached, perhaps in the best possible way, by Paul and Barnabas. Satan is against that; and it is all the more urgent that we should keep to the faith, the truth of the gospel. Paul says to the Galatians: "If any one announce to you as glad tidings anything besides what ye have received, let him be accursed" @Galatians 1:9. He does not put it off either; he means right now, "Let him be accursed", that is the one who would preach to them any other glad tidings than that which had been preached unto them, so
{420}
confident was Paul that he had the full truth. It was "the faith", from which Elymas the magician was endeavouring to turn the proconsul away. Satan's business here tonight is to turn away the mind of anyone who is listening, to divert you from the faith. He endeavours to divert you from what I am saying. Paul dealt with this man Elymas, but I do not go into that. We read in @Acts 13:12, "Then the proconsul seeing what had happened, believed, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord". He was an intelligent man as a part of the treasure. It is what the Lord is seeking. He seeks in believers that they should be intelligent. This man was intelligent, and now when he saw the power of God operating against the enemy, when he saw what happened to Elymas, he was astonished at the *teaching* -- not the power, notice! It was the teaching that struck him; and one would hope that as I am speaking to you what is said may strike you as different from what you may have been accustomed to -- different teaching.
The gospel implies teaching, and we must be intelligent if we are to be of any value in the assembly, for that is the point in the treasure. @Matthew 13:46 speaks of one idea, the pearl, whereas the treasure may be varied, and it is. We read in @Acts 1 of one hundred and twenty persons who are all distinguished. Those persons were the result of the Lord's ministry. So the Lord wants intelligent people. You say, I am a poor, ignorant christian! Well, it may be so, but it should not be! The Lord is endeavouring to instruct you. It was said of old: "My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge". @Hosea 4:6. Satan has the advantage where people are ignorant. Indeed, it is a very solemn thing, for the Spirit of God says, "If any be ignorant, let him be ignorant", @1 Corinthians 14:38. Who would be included in that? Persons who come to the meetings, and who listen, but who
{421}
never get the good of the truth, never take it in, never practise it. Some day the Lord will say to such, You are to be ignorant! That would be judicial, a most solemn thing! But this man, Sergius Paulus, is not going to be ignorant; he is an intelligent man already, and now he is amazed at the teaching of the Lord. You see, he is, as I may say, secured. The Lord needs you, He needs your intelligence. I am speaking now to believers, for many think it is optional whether I understand the truth or not. It is not optional. If you keep on being ignorant, you may stay there. I am not saying a true believer can be lost, but I am saying what the Spirit of God says in @1 Corinthians 14:38, "If any be ignorant, let him be ignorant". You say, Would you not preach the gospel to that man? If I knew that man I would not; he is done for! How solemn to be neglecting what the Spirit of God is engaged with! The Spirit of God is here to teach us: why should I not be taught?
Then the next kind of people you get in relation to the gospel are *happy*: "The disciples were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit", @Acts 13:52. Some people are filled with joy, and are not filled with the Holy Spirit. The gospel is intended to make people happy, but the power for happiness is the Holy Spirit. There may be somebody here who is quite intelligent in the doctrine, who could tell me the facts of the gospel, and yet has not the Holy Spirit, but whose heart is cold; there is not a bit of joy in his heart! This part of the chapter is to show that the gospel, in securing the treasure, secures people who are happy too, but happy in a holy way. Heaven is not to be filled with doleful people, with depressed people. I am no testimony in the gospel if I am of that character. I should have joy in my soul. Paul says, "Rejoice in the Lord always". @Philippians 4:4. You say, I have been bereaved of my wife. Well, the Lord will weep
{422}
with you; but nothing should take away your joy in the Holy Spirit. Has the Holy Spirit ceased acting in me because I have been bereaved? No! It is the testimony of the gospel, and I need the Holy Spirit.
In chapter 14 we see a man who had *faith*. Of course, all these persons had faith, but faith is another variety of this treasure, all making for the assembly. These features will all come out in our meetings in persons, real believers. We shall be intelligent, happy in the Spirit, and finally, we shall have faith. That is the next thing. Some people know the gospel in the terms of it, but faith is lacking. Of course, you cannot get anything from God apart from faith. I was speaking earlier of the provisional thing, of the world being reconciled to God. That is provisional; it cannot last; but while the world is in reconciliation provisionally there will not be the antichrist active properly; that is a great comfort at the present time. Not only that, but while that provisional purchase of the field is in force where the Lord is operating to get out the treasure -- for what He is aiming at all the time is this treasure -- one idea is in His heart, and the one idea is the pearl. No one would divide a pearl; you could a diamond, but not a pearl. A pearl is a very interesting thing, too, in a natural way, but infinitely more interesting in a spiritual setting. It represents one great idea. A man who has understanding as to pearls is seeking goodly pearls, and he finds one, as we read in @Matthew 13:46. These details are to bring out how interested the Lord is in us, how He would secure us as belonging to this treasure.
This man of whom we read next in @Acts 14:8 is a man who has faith: "A certain man in Lystra, impotent in his feet, sat, being lame from his mother's womb, who had never walked. This man heard Paul speaking, who, fixing his eyes on him, and seeing that he had faith to be healed". Now you see the
{423}
kind of man he is! Paul represents Christ; he is moving in the energy of the Spirit, and he sees that the man has faith. Mind you, the man is not doing anything yet, but as having faith, he is part of the treasure.
Faith will not be needed in heaven, but the point is what the Lord has down here: He wants us for that purpose. The hymn we sang at the beginning of the meeting did not quite suit me because it makes too much of the believer going to heaven. We ought to have more in mind what God is going on with down here. He needs us down here for the assembly; He needs an intelligent man, He needs a happy man who has the Spirit. It does not say that the proconsul had, but the disciples in verse 52 had the Holy Spirit and were joyful. Then He needs a man who has faith, for the dispensation of God is in faith (@1 Timothy 1:4). He is operating on that principle, and He wants people who have faith. If we are to be used of God we must have faith. Paul sees that this man at Lystra has it. There was that treasure in Lystra, that bit of gold, and Paul and Barnabas were sent of the Holy Spirit to get that. The Lord wants you not only to have faith to believe the gospel, but to be *a man of faith*. So in @Acts 6 we get a man like Stephen, one of the seven appointed to be deacons, to look after the saints, and serve the saints. It says, "They chose Stephen, a man full of faith", @Acts 6:5. Even to prepare food for the saints at a meeting like this, you need faith, or you are not serving rightly. You say, Anybody can do that! Can they? God does not want 'anybody'. He wants persons moving in service on the principle of faith. His service is carried on outside the world on the principle of faith. Every young person here who is sincere wants to be in that, and to have faith for it. Of course, you need faith to be saved. The Lord said to the woman in Simon the Pharisee's house, just as
{424}
she left, "Thy faith has saved thee; go in peace", @Luke 7:50. He says, You have faith for salvation. He does not say, You have faith to be a minister, like Paul and Barnabas, but, You have faith for salvation. But what I am speaking of now goes beyond that. Here is a man who is characteristically a possessor of faith. Faith is the gift of God, of course, but why should I be without it? Why should I pose as a christian without it? Not only should I have faith for believing the gospel, but faith to be a man for God here in His dispensation which is in faith. That is needed: that is part of the treasure.
The Lord is operating here in Painswick to get somebody, perhaps to get all of us. I ask constantly that my faith may be increased. We need it; we are in difficult times. This man was not doing anything but sitting, being a cripple from his infancy, having never walked: "This man heard Paul speaking, who, fixing his eyes on him, and seeing that he had faith". He *had* it: it is a characteristic thought. It is another feature of the treasure, and surely everybody as I am speaking would say, I would like to be thoroughly in that, so that I may walk by faith, do my business by faith, rule my house by faith, move in relation to the people of God by faith! That is the idea; because it is needed for the treasure now. The Lord values the treasure as having these elements, and the Spirit of God knows where they are, and the evangelist is like the woman sweeping the house to get them. So this man is secured, for it says, "Seeing that he had faith to be healed said with a loud voice, Rise up straight upon thy feet: and he sprang up and walked". He is a conscript, but a conscript for the army of faith, in relation to God's world. I suppose the word was authoritative: "Rise up straight upon thy feet", He was secured for the testimony, for this wonderful dispensation in which we are; and it was not an optional matter with him.
{425}
You will say, no doubt, that I have preached more about the assembly than about the gospel, but the gospel and the assembly go together. The assembly is the great objective in view in securing souls by the gospel. Of course, we are secured for heaven; we shall go up together. Let no one here think he will go up by himself! When we go to heaven, we go all together. Scripture never says that when I die I go to heaven; it tells me that I shall go to be with the Lord, with Christ. When we go to heaven we shall go together, as it says, "*We* ... ..shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we shall be always with the Lord", @1 Thessalonians 4:17. May God bless the word!
{426}
DAYS OF BLESSING AND DAYS OF JUDGMENT
@Luke 17:20 - 37
This section of this gospel arises from certain questions asked, as you will observe, by the Pharisees. The Lord answered them and then went on to speak to His disciples. I mention this so that we may understand the passage. He did not satisfy the curiosity of the Pharisees, but what follows from verse 22 and onwards refers to the disciples, that they should be conversant with the coming of the Son of Man. As most of us here are disciples, this information is peculiarly our property, and, as one of them, I am undertaking, hoping the Lord will help, to speak of the information which was given to the disciples.
First, the enquiry of the Pharisees and the answer which the Lord gave them need special attention. He spoke to them in testimony, not in any way answering their curiosity. It does not say He answered their questions, but that He "answered them". They wanted to know when the kingdom of God should come. Many such questions are found in the Scriptures which the Lord never answers directly; He answers the questioners. And these questioners here were Pharisees, they were those who were professedly opposed to Christ, but some were ready to listen, even as it is today. There are many who at heart are opposed to Christ, but who, at times, are ready to give an ear, not as having any sense of need, but in a certain patronising kind of way. There may be some of this kind of person here. You would perhaps be more interested if I unfolded prophecy and indicated something of current events. You might be more interested in that than in a gospel address. So
{427}
it says that the Lord "answered them", and He put it on them, that in their very midst was the kingdom of God. It was a present thing then and it is a present thing at this time. The coming of the Son of Man is a future thing, and it is that futurity which the Lord explains to His disciples. Those of us who are intelligent disciples have some knowledge of this, but the Lord's answer to the Pharisees belongs to the gospel, it belongs to the present time. The kingdom of God is a present reality and is not at a distance from us, but is in our midst here in this city. Very few recognise it, but it is one of the greatest of facts that there is such a thing, in this very city at this very minute, and it is here, not as against us, but for us. It belongs indeed to the gospel, for it is part of the gospel testimony.
And so the Lord leaves the Pharisees and turns to the disciples to tell them of future things. I hope to dwell on this, not in any way to gratify any natural curiosity as to prophetic matters, but to speak about the solemn fact that there is a future thing which is very imminent and which is spoken of here as "the days of the Son of Man". The kingdom of God is a *present* fact; its presence then depended upon the presence of the Lord Jesus amongst men. It was there because *He* was in their midst and it is a present thing now because the Spirit of God is here. When the Lord comes in in judgment by and by it will be the days of the Son of Man. He will then be on His Own throne and it will be retribution and judgment; now it is grace, and that is why I read that query of the Pharisees, so that we might all understand what the Lord's reply really means.
So the Lord says, "The kingdom of God is in the midst of you". John the baptist says, "In the midst of you stands, whom ye do not know". @John 1:26. The Lord Jesus was *among* them; not simply that He had become incarnate, but He was *among* them. "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us". @John 1:14.
{428}
The gospels are full of the facts relative to that presence to which John alludes: "In the midst of you stands, whom ye do not know". He it is, John says, who "comes after me who takes a place before me", and he also says "the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose". @John 1:26,27. Such was He! And such, dear friends, is the position now. Although Jesus is not here as He was then, yet He *is* here. He has come in in the power of the Spirit and He is here to save, indeed the very preaching is said to be by Him. After He had died and risen again, it says, "Coming, he has preached the glad tidings of peace to you who were afar off, and the glad tidings of peace to those who were nigh", @Ephesians 2:17. The very preaching is by Christ, and so Paul said, "Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me" @2 Corinthians 13:3, and he would so verify this great statement of the Lord that the Spirit says of him as he served at Thessalonica, "He went in among them", @Acts 17:2. He was not like many at the present time who claim to be representative of Christ but who retain religious dignity and maintain it too. The Lord Jesus said, "*I* am in the midst of you as the one that serves" @Luke 22:27, and Paul went in among them at Thessalonica, and "on three sabbaths reasoned with them from the scriptures". @Acts 17:2. Paul not only preached, but he was what he preached, and that is the position now. Many of us here, while we do not pretend to anything much, are believers in Jesus; we are christians; we have accepted "the word of the truth, the glad tidings of your salvation", @Ephesians 1:13. The Holy Spirit too is here, dwelling in us. He is in those who are around *you* -- around anyone who is enquiring; you are thus in the very midst of the kingdom of God!
The Lord's answer to the Pharisees is thus the first great thought for anyone who is interested in the truth at this time. "The kingdom of God is in the midst of you".
{429}
The question is, Has it affected you? I am referring to the presence of the Spirit here, for He is as really here as Christ was in the days of His flesh; He is here tonight in this gospel preaching, ready to strive with anyone who has come here with need in his soul. The Holy Spirit would make you more interested; He is here to strive or plead. That is one of His great services in relation to the gospel at the present time. God says, "My spirit shall not always plead with Man", @Genesis 6:3. He shall not always do it, but He is doing it now, and that is the wonderful fact about this meeting, that the Spirit is here in the sense of pleading or striving, urging you not to be so unwise, so foolish may I say, so mad, as to go on your way ignoring such an opportunity as this, an opportunity which may end at any moment. We read of God speaking through an ass, "The dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the folly of the prophet", @2 Peter 2:16. And so it is now, dear friends, in my little way, God would forbid the folly of some young person here who is disregarding his eternal welfare. Regarding his present welfare, it may be, but really disregarding both his present and eternal welfare. God would forbid that in your soul; He would say, 'Call a halt!' You may read the Scripture in your own home, but it will not have the same force when read there. The Holy Spirit is here purposely in relation to the gospel; He has been sent down in order that the gospel should be preached in His power; hence the point in preaching is to bring in conviction. The Spirit is present in the form of the kingdom to urge men and women and children to call a halt and to repent. It is not only the power of the words, but the Spirit urging you at the present time. It is the moral persuasion in it. God is urging, pleading with men by His Spirit not to continue in their madness, but to turn to Him and have to say to Him, and settle now, once for all, this matter
{430}
The time is very short, for the Spirit will not always plead, but He is here tonight in the character of the kingdom of God, which is said to be "in the midst of you". Peter said of the Lord Jesus, "Who went through all quarters doing good, and healing all that were under the power of the devil, because God was with him", @Acts 10:38. And again Paul says, "How that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their offences", @2 Corinthians 5:19.
Well, that is what enters into that statement, and I urge it on you, that God is here to meet you. In the types in the book of Leviticus we have the blood on the mercy-seat and the faces of the cherubim were turned toward the mercy-seat (@Exodus 25:20), but in the book of Chronicles the faces of the cherubim were toward the house; that is, God, satisfied with the death of Jesus, looks out (@2 Chronicles 3:13). He is looking for returning prodigals, but He is looking out kingdom-wise. He is not only inside, in the holiest, looking out, but coming out kingdom-wise on the lines of striving, God Himself coming out to effect a change of heart and mind in order that we might turn.
And so the Lord, having said, "The kingdom of God is in the midst of you", turns to His disciples, and says, "Days are coming, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and shall not see it". It is not that there will not be that eventually but there will be deceivers; do not heed them. "But first", the Lord says, "he must suffer many things and be rejected of this generation". That is instruction for us, and I am endeavouring to bring it out. He suffered many things of that generation; He suffered from man, but the gospel requires that I should tell you that He suffered from the hand of God. That is instruction for the disciples, and we have come to some little knowledge of the preciousness of the
{431}
death of Jesus. It belongs to our treasuries and we are to bring it forth. We love these opportunities when we can bring out the knowledge we have acquired of the atoning sufferings of Jesus. It is teaching which is required now; no one can preach rightly without bringing out that part of the private instruction which the Lord has given to him. We bring it forth, and it is in this sense that the preaching goes on. We bring forth what we have learnt in secret with God as to the atoning work of Jesus. The Scriptures abound in it; every time we get the death of Christ set out in the types, all pointed to this one thing. The Lord is constantly brining this before us so that we should be able to bring it out that others might come into the benefit of it: that He suffered and died on the cross, and that He cried twice with a loud voice: first, to signify that He suffered at the hand of God, exhausting the judgment of God against sin; secondly to indicate that He had ended the man who had brought in the whole condition of sin.
All this is instruction which the Lord is furnishing us with constantly, and it is to be imparted to others so that the consciences of unconverted people may be affected. "Jesus our Lord, who has been delivered for our offences and has been raised for our justification", @Romans 4:24,25 as if nothing else entered into it! How God condenses the truth of the death of Christ, so that the sinner might take it in! "Delivered for our offences and has been raised again for our justification ... Therefore having been justified on the principle of faith, we have peace towards God through our Lord Jesus Christ". @Romans 5:1. That is what disciples can tell you. Any one of us, perhaps all, may be able to tell you and help you, but the preaching of it is the thing. It is accompanied by peculiar power, by the power of the kingdom; that is, of persuasion, that you should turn round and have this matter settled.
{432}
"Repent and believe in the glad tidings", @Mark 1:15. That is quite an order, you know! It is not simply believe the feeble words which I speak, but to believe the whole matter. Read the book of Romans and other such books, and digest them.
Now having said all that about the gospel itself, I must proceed to speak of "the days of the Son of Man". It is a future thing, and the Lord credits the disciples with desires to see it, but it is not to be seen yet. The seeing of it is when the thing arrives, but it has not arrived yet. I am about to use these verses to persuade further uncertain people to decide to take sides with Christ. There may be some who have not decided to leave the world, and I know how it pulls, both the business and social sides. The social side is a terrible weapon of Satan's. There may be some who would assent to what I say, but it is remarkable how difficult it is to get young persons to answer a straight question, and why is that? It is because they have reserves. You stand like a statue without a tongue, and you will not answer a straight question as to your soul! Why? You have the social and business world in your mind. The Lord says, "As it took place in the days of Noe, thus also shall it be in the days of the Son of man: they ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed all of them". That is the first thing the Lord brings forth. Do not be at all deceived as to "the days of the Son of man"; it is going to be a great public affair. Some people talk about death being the end of everything, and of going to be with the Lord as if it were the end, but it is not. The coming of the Lord is going to be a great public affair, so we are not to be deceived as regards the Son of Man, it is a public occasion, and we who love Jesus are all looking for it, we are waiting for it, but then, the question is, *Am I ready*? That is the
{433}
point. Why should the Lord bring in this matter about Noah? There is not a word here about the building of the ark; He does not refer to that, He refers to what was going on before that. What were they doing? It is a question of the social world. He says, "They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark". Maybe some young man or young woman here is thinking of getting married; that is quite right in its place, but perhaps he is not ready yet to commit himself to Christ. He is not infidel about it, but he is putting it off; his own affairs are more important!
In Lot's case it is building and planting; it is the commercial and industrial world. It says, "They ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded". That is what marked Lot's world. The Lord would not have said this as a mere matter of instructing the disciples, but that they should use it, and I am using it while the kingdom of God has a present existence, that you might take advantage of it. The Lord is saying that you may be allowing the social world or the commercial world. Monday is the great day for Lot's world, but Saturday for Noah's world. I often think of Saturday as the great day on the social side. In Noah's day they were given up to social affairs. The Lord does not call attention to their unbelief and the seriousness of it, but to the social entertainments. What times they had! Think of all the children of Methuselah! He lived nine hundred and sixty-nine years, and think of all the children and the grandchildren and the great-grandchildren, and think of the social affairs they must have had! They would know each other, no doubt, but the flood came and took them all away. How solemn that is! The days of the Son of Man are about to appear. On Saturday young people hike off, or go to the football or the cricket match. You
{434}
will say, 'All that is legitimate'. But you are leaving God out of the matter! He does not say anything in detail against them. Marriage is quite legitimate, but what about God? What about the ark which Noah is building? That would have been a great subject to laugh about on the tennis court or at the tea table! 'What does he mean', they might say, 'this man building the ark? There is no rain!' The Lord says, "The flood came and destroyed all of them". How solemn! There would be some very nice, good sort of people, we might say, those able to take the lead in the sports, but the flood came, and that is the solemn thing. Are you going to take a risk as to that, preferring your pleasures and social affairs till the Son of Man comes?
Then there is the other side; the Lord says, as to those in Lot's days, "They ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded". The building trade was apparently good, agriculture too was good. They went to the markets, they made good bargains and sales and good profits; it was all quite legitimate, and no policeman would interfere with that; but then the Lord says, "On the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulphur from heaven, and destroyed all of them". It seems to me that the Lord is speaking to someone here tonight, who is putting off this eternal matter and disregarding the rights of Christ over his soul. He may have the social or the commercial or professional side in view, and that he is going to shine in that, but some day Lot will go out of Sodom. The Lord will take His people, and what then? Judgment. Is it worth while? I need not answer that question. The Lord means these remarks to have their voice. He wants you to throw over all the social side and all the commercial side and have to do with God about your soul. Settle that matter now and join us christians in the knowledge and enjoyment of what we
{435}
have in the power of the Spirit here! We invite you to join us.
The Lord further says, "Remember the wife of Lot". There is no evidence that she was an insubject wife in the ordinary sense of the word; she went out of Sodom with Lot, but she looked back. She did not want to go. She was under the influence of a godly man and she and two daughters went out. The sons-in-law did not go out, but Lot's wife did, yet she looked back. It is a word for wives, and, indeed, for all who are hankering after the world. Perhaps we are not content with the divine provision for us, but think of the Lord marking that action and bringing it in here in these words, "Remember the wife of Lot". The compression of the Lord's discourse is wonderful; it shows how much can be said in a few words. Much more could be said about her and what she became, for she became a pillar of salt. She looked back; she did not go back, she looked back; it is a question of the state of her heart. It was something which God abhors, and that is unreality. Wives under the influence of their husbands, and yet their hearts in the world! It is a solemn word, "Remember the wife of Lot". Then so that there should be no mistake, the Lord says, "Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it, and whosoever shall lose it shall preserve it". The Lord here is warning us against making the most of our lives here, and the danger of not being satisfied with what is necessary. Perhaps we want to make a show. That is, our lives are in this matter; we are making the most of the things of the world by the use of external things here. The Lord says that a man's life does not consist in the things which he possesses, and so He warns us here, "Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it, and whosoever shall lose it shall preserve it". That is christianity. That is the Lord's way of pointing out a true disciple; he gives all that
{436}
up, whatever he may be, because of what he possesses. Christ is his life, and he loses his dignity and show here because of that. That man will go into eternity in full sail, as it were. It is as Peter says, "Thus shall the entrance into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ be richly furnished unto you", @2 Peter 1:11.
Then the Lord goes on here to call attention to two men in one bed. The State has nothing against these two men, the neighbours have nothing against them, but *one shall be seized and the other let go*! And this seizing is for judgment; the letting go here, in this scripture, contemplates the coming of the Son of Man, and it is letting go for blessing. In other words, one is a christian and the other is not. They may use the same bed, but some morning, one of them is gone! Then again the Lord says, "Two women shall be grinding together"; they are doing what is very good work, hard, but good work. Who can complain about that? No ordinary man. But, *one is seized and the other let go*! Well, there it is. Am I going to be in a case like that? Yet the Lord is going on to the end of His discourse, and He is bringing it home to every person. So He says, "Two men shall be in the field". It is quite right to be there, for Scripture tells us that "The king himself is dependent upon the field" @Ecclesiastes 5:9, but *one is seized*! You say, What is all this about? It is a question of secret history, and the end will bring out what you are. In the field one appears as good as another, but it is a question of secret history with God. What is the one seized for? Judgment! Now I say that because the disciples say to the Lord, "Where, Lord?" but the Lord knew what they meant, and He says, "Where the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together". It is a most humiliating thought, a carcase of an unbeliever. It is said of some that their "carcases fell in the wilderness", @Hebrews 3:17.
{437}
It is not here the lake of fire; it is a question of what a man is, and here his carcase is exposed. The apostle says, "If indeed being also clothed we shall not be found naked", @2 Corinthians 5:3. Think of being found naked! I may have been in fellowship, I may even have preached, but the Lord points to the carcase. The matter is found out, and "where the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together". They are unerring in their discovery, and the whole thing is exposed. As Moses said, "Be sure your sin will find you out", @Numbers 32:23. Often we are affected by what is said but we do nothing about it. Ahab sought to conceal himself in his army, but the eagles found him out in spite of his concealment; the bow drawn at a venture found him. And so it is; what the eagles will find is a carcase, that is what the Lord indicates. The whole of this discourse is most solemn at the present time, so that we may close in and settle matters with God and be clear in the matter. If you are a believer the eagles will never find you; your body will be carefully preserved. It will be "in the cave of Machpelah", @Genesis 23:9. That means that the Lord looks after the bodies of true believers. It says in Jude that Michael the archangel contended with the devil about the body of Moses. Satan would have had that body, but you will recall that the Lord buried Moses. All His own are in His care, in "the cave of Machpelah". But here the Lord says, "Where the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together". It is an exposed carcase.
May God help us, because it is a matter of the disciples¬ knowledge being used to help others to get light and to join with us in the enjoyment of the blessings of the gospel.

HOW UNITY IN MINISTRY IS SECURED
@Mark 3:13 - 15; @Acts 1:4 - 5; @1 Samuel 19:19 - 24; @John 16:13,14
J.T. A simple thought is in mind but one of great importance if there is to be unity, especially unity in the ministry which the Lord gives. The thought is that those who minister are seen as learning together from Christ, coming under His sway and influence together. First in Mark, which is the Gospel for ministers particularly, we are told that the Lord went up into the mountain and called "whom he himself would, and they went to him. And he appointed twelve that they might be with him, and that he might send them to preach, and to have power to heal diseases, and to cast out demons". The great general thought in mind is there, the Lord's sovereign selection, but made as on the mountain, that is in moral elevation. Then in @Acts 1 the command is given as He was assembled with them, pointing to the need of the Spirit, as He says, "Being assembled with them, commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to await the promise of the Father, which [said he] ye have heard of me. For John indeed baptised with water, but *ye* shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit after now not many days", implying in a moral way that their service was to be in the power of the Spirit, not in natural power.
Then in Samuel, in the well-known passage read, the Lord is seen in type in presidency, seen as presiding over the prophets, not instructing them, but prophesying is actually going on, and the effect is to overcome all opposition to Himself in type, that is, all opposition to David is overcome by the sight of this service carried on and the power of it. Saul
{439}
sent messengers to take David and they saw a company of prophets prophesying and Samuel standing as president over them. The full result is seen there as to its public effect, being the service of God from the standpoint of public prophetic ministry. John shows in the verses read that the Spirit "shall guide you into all the truth". On an occasion like this, one and another speaks but the Spirit alone guides us so that the truth is reached, the object being to guide us into *all* the truth. This will prevent such a thing as sectarianism, which is usually built up on truth in a partial way.
C.H.H. Is the moral elevation in Mark really a fundamental feature in service?
J.T. I think it is, as lifting us out of man's realm, that is the world in its religious aspect. Theology and all the education for the service of God nominally is now on the level of ordinary instruction, just a branch of ordinary education. A man goes through a curriculum for the ministry, as it is called, as for medicine or any other science; in fact, theology is treated as a science, bringing it down to man's level, whereas the Lord lifts it up to the heavenly platform, a mountain usually denoting that which is above what is current in the world. That is the first point attention is to be called to. He goes up into the mountain, that is a mountain in contrast to the plain; the article indicates that it is a definite thought in the Lord's mind.
J.R.F. Would you say that going up involves considerable exercise?
J.T. That is another thing; that is obedience, and would mean not only physical but also spiritual exercise.
E.B.McC. Would you say all are in this who have heard the voice and have been called by Him? That is, they are called to service, or is it some particular company here that is in view?
{440}
J.T. We are not told how many He called, only how many He appointed. It says, "He calls whom he himself would, and they went to him. And he appointed twelve that they might be with him, and that he might send them to preach". That is the next thing, the sovereign call and the sovereign selection or appointment, and then that the appointed ones should be with Him. That is a very important part of the matter.
C.F.I. Would that be where they would get qualified for service?
J.T. Being with the Lord we can know His influence. Being with Him is a point of importance; we need to be with each other, too, but that is not the point here, but to be with Him in these circumstances. All the facts mentioned enter into the matter, but you are with the One who calls sovereignly and makes sovereign appointments and would have us in His company.
C.H.H. It says, "They went to him". Is that important too?
J.T. Quite so, not simply that they went up but that they went to Him. They might have gone up and looked around, as many do, on an elevation, at the landscape or the scenery, but they went to Him, which is another matter altogether. He is occupied with another world.
E.W.C. In speaking of being together with the Lord, is that where you are focusing our attention, upon the saints in assembly?
J.T. That is the next thing, as we are told by Luke, "Being assembled together with them".
W.H.W. Would this be the normal result of the gospel being rightly understood? We would apprehend in our souls that the gospel does not in any way fit us for the world here but is to fit us to be with the Lord.
{441}
J.T. If you widen it out that way, but we are dealing with ministers. What you say is true, but we are dealing with persons whom the Lord fits specially to minister. How careful He is as to His position! In Luke, when it is a question of the gospel, He comes down on to the plain, that is, He comes down to where men are, but in ministry He goes up, a question of the exercise of prophets to minister.
C.H.H. Does there not appear to be discrimination in the selection for service?
J.T. Very great discrimination: "Whom he himself would". That is the point in the call, and then the appointment is a further discriminating thought. He appointed twelve, that is definite, an administrative thought. The word "appointment" points to administration.
C.F.I. What enters into this matter of sovereign selection -- is it something in the vessel?
J.T. Quite so. If God is going to take one up for the greatest work ever contemplated, the promulgation of the testimony in this world, He certainly has been thinking of him long before he existed. Even Cyrus was thought of long before he was born. Paul says he was separated from his infancy, but God goes a long way back; in fact, He always has had us in His mind in view of these things. God being God is infinite, and He ordains conditions and circumstances for such persons as He will use before He calls them at all. They would be external circumstances, such as parentage, grand-parentage, great grand-parentage, nationality, all these things are in the mind of God. Nothing is accidental so that He has the kind of person He wants. The vessel is to be regarded by itself, and then the moral side affecting it, but the vessel as a creation of God has to be regarded by itself, his capacities, abilities,
{442}
faculties, as well as his external circumstances, then how God affects him morally.
F.J.F. Would you go as far as the point of ascension, so that those who minister should have the full light of His present position?
J.T. That is what comes out in the gospel of Luke, and in the gospel of Mark, too, also in the Acts. They are witnesses of His resurrection but they are with Him. @Acts 1 contemplates the forty days in which He was with them as risen. "Being assembled with them" doubtless alludes to what Luke speaks of in more detail in his last chapter, so that they get the instructions needed, particularly as to the Spirit instead of His companionship and what He taught them. They must not attempt to serve without the Holy Spirit and that is one of the most important things to take note of, that service must be in the power of the Spirit and not be mere human training.
J.R.F. That would involve great dependence.
J.T. That is the point He makes as assembled with them, as it is a fresh position. In assembly with Him was to involve His peculiar influence: "Being assembled with them, commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to await the promise of the Father". He brings the Father into it on the line of promise.
E.S.H. Would the Spirit involve our merging assembly-wise?
J.T. In this way we are told: "To whom also he presented himself living, after he had suffered, with many proofs; being seen by them during forty days, and speaking of the things which concern the kingdom of God; and, being assembled with them, commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to await the promise of the Father, which [said he] ye have heard of me. For John indeed baptised with water, but *ye* shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit after now not many days", @Acts 1:3 - 5.
{443}
E.B.McC. The scripture in Mark would make it clear that they must first be with Him that He might send them forth. They would drink of His Spirit, and they must have the Holy Spirit.
J.T. They would have His influence and commandments in that peculiar setting. It was an assembly matter which is altogether ignored in popular ordinations of ministers and it is given in the strictest and most accurate way and stressed too in the gospel and in the Acts and the Epistles.
F.W. Is that to make us understand the true power of the minister, that the source is divine and, therefore, authoritative. The previous incident in Mark refers to unclean spirits falling down and crying, "*Thou* art the Son of God". @Mark 3:11. I was thinking of what is said here, that the twelve were appointed that they might be with the Lord and that He might send them out to preach, so that all would proceed from Him. The passage in the Acts recognizes the power of the Spirit.
J.T. It is all beautifully linked together. The preposition used in @Acts 1:5 is a preposition of power and means that the baptism is in real power, no mere ready-made thing as we often regard it, but in power. "*Ye* shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit after now not many days". It is a question of time and days, but not many. So that they would look for a real thing, power coming upon them.
L.D.M. Would the recognition of divine appointment and selection help those who serve? They would be with God as to what He was doing. Gifts are set in the assembly sovereignly by God (@1 Corinthians 12:28).
J.T. Those who serve ought to be able to recognise gift in others and make way for it. The passage you refer to is the first thought of God setting gifts in the, assembly; they are for His own use. The Lord had been much concerned, as these passages show,
{444}
that there should be unity amongst them, that they should be one. They were to have a fellowship. John says, "Our fellowship is indeed with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ", @1 John 1:3 meaning the apostles¬, and the saints were to have fellowship with them. That cannot be so now, of course. Ministering brothers have not a fellowship of their own, but what John says about the apostles helps as showing the distinctive place that ministers have in the mind of God and how there should be unity in their ministry.
C.H.H. Do we see that exemplified in Peter: "According as our beloved brother Paul also has written to you according to the wisdom given to him, as also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things", @2 Peter 3:15,16?
J.T. Peter came to that at the end. One of the best things he says as he is about to put off his tabernacle is that he was thoroughly with Paul regarding his writings of scripture.
F.W. Is your thought to help us to rise to think of the ministry above what is expository in regard of the scriptures, and take account of the source from which it comes so that it will have power in our souls?
J.T. That is very good. All these scriptures read would bear this out. Everything issues from Christ. He makes the calls, He chooses the position from which He calls and to which He calls, and those called go to Him there. He makes the appointment "that they might be with him, and that he might send them to preach, and to have power to heal diseases, and to cast out demons". There are three things: preaching, power for healing diseases and casting out demons. What a great matter it is and how needful it is to follow the directions given here!
S.H.B. Is the call and appointment something apart from the exercises of the person called and appointed.
{445}
I was thinking as to why Judas was called and appointed.
J.T. Another matter comes up there. That involves the fulfilment of scripture and another line of thought enters into it. It comes into the category of why God allows sin at all. We have to deal with what is. Judas was selected, in fact, was used, and there is no doubt he had power, yet he failed. At least, I suppose the Lord's remark in @John 13 would mean he had power, as he represented Him so far: "He who receives whomsoever I shall send receives me" @John 13:20.
F.J.F. Paul was very careful as to what he did.
J.T. Just so, and that is said by an apostle. This opens up the line of thought that Mr. B.¬s remark brings in, but we cannot enter into that now, but it is there, why these things happen. Is it not a dark negative warning for all ministers that one may preach and teach and yet himself be a castaway? It is a very solemn searching thing.
A.M.H. Would the thought of baptism help us in that? The baptism of water is referred to here as freeing us from the external, and would the idea of being baptised by the Spirit meet what is within so that the man is held in the power of the Spirit?
J.T. Very good. 'In' would imply the operation, the Spirit active, not merely come in as we say in a theoretic way, but active and you are conscious that you are affected inwardly.
J.R.F. Would you say that Judas never reached that?
J.T. You cannot say much. It says in @Hebrews 6:4, "Have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit". A most remarkable word, yet there is falling away. That does not mean that such are really sealed by the Holy Spirit, but it may go as far as the anointing, the public effect on a person who had part in christianity. Many did this at the beginning, coming into it because of the signs, so that they are said to "have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God, and the works of power of the age to come, and have fallen away". @Hebrews 6:4 - 6.
{446}
It alludes to the public power and action of the Spirit that anyone might come into, as actively subject but not born again, and hence would fall away.
A.M.H. Is Saul an instance of that in the scripture read, Saul the king, falling down?
J.T. Saul is one who was anointed, and David recognises that, yet he fell under the judgment of God.
C.F.I. What is the thought of being maintained in power and service? The Lord gave them power. Would the baptism of the Holy Spirit ensure a continuance of it?
J.T. It opens up the question of the doctrine of the Spirit which @Romans 8 gives us, showing what power the Spirit has as He has place in us. The subject is based really on the statement of the apostle, "So then *I myself* with the mind serve God's law", @Romans 7:25. That is a resolution made by a man who is thoroughly subject to the word of God. He has come to it and has resolved that it should dominate his mind; note that he serves God's law with the mind. It is not a case of if I can, but a definite resolve. The Spirit comes in in chapter 8 and supports him. That is the way the truth works out in every believer, but particularly in those who serve, because our minds are so treacherous. Unless we arrive at that in our souls, that we will serve nothing but God's law, we shall be easily turned aside.
Rem. "Ezra had directed his heart to seek the law of Jehovah and to do it, and to teach in Israel the statutes and the ordinances", @Ezra 7:10.
J.T. Seeking God's law, doing it and teaching it. Therefore, Luke says to Theophilus, "Concerning all things which Jesus began both to do and to teach", @Acts 1:1 meaning that the minister does the things himself, in
{447}
principle at least, and then teaches, to do and to teach.
C.F.I. Is power dependent on subjective and moral state in the minister?
J.T. Quite so. "*I myself*" is a fine phrase. It is one finding his consciousness through the remarkable analysis spoken of in @Romans 7. He has arrived at a solid footing on the moral line, "*I myself* with the mind serve God's law". That is a great moral victory and the Holy Spirit supports the man who comes to it, according to chapter 8.
E.B.McC. What would bring in the authority for the service as being together? They would be subject one to another and subject to the Lord's selection. He gives their names here.
J.T. Brethren ought to know each other in that sense, specially the sense of ability given and selection made, hence the names. No doubt the names given here would point to what each one was. This was written long after the twelve had been in active service by the power of the Spirit. He gave to Simon the surname of Peter, and to James and John the surname of Boanerges, Sons of thunder. The thought is that the ministers are to know each other. Any one of them going over the list would say, I remember the Lord giving those names, but did not understand then because of not having the Spirit. It is doubtful if they understood anything rightly before having the Spirit, but they could then see why Peter's name was changed.
F.F. This would seem to be peculiar to Mark, would it not? Further on in the gospel the Lord says, "In my name they shall cast out demons" @Mark 16:17. Is that connected with the special power spoken of here?
J.T. I should not confine it to Mark, but it is stressed. The seventy had power to cast out demons "through thy name" @Luke 10:17, but it is very
{448}
much stressed in @Mark 16:20, "The Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs following upon it". So that they themselves should have power to cast out demons.
F.J.F. Would the result of being with Him be seen in the five stones David chose? Is that an illustration of the finish of the ministry that they would know how to choose, and the character of the stones would be smooth?
J.T. You would know how to select a scripture for an address and know how to use it. There is such a thing as finding it in a valley or a stream where the action of the water came on the stones. The matter of disease here should be noticed. It is more defined, it is current -- things cropping up. We have power to deal with them in the meetings, healing diseases and casting out demons.
S.H.B. Do we understand that in the calling and the appointing the moral state of the vessel is taken account of, or is that done afterwards to maintain the vessel in that line?
J.T. The moral state, of course, cannot be omitted, but certainly it was not dealt with in each case as they were called. Much had to be accomplished afterwards. A vessel is really taken up potentially, but the matter of Judas has to be treated by itself, that such a man was taken up. What is the lesson? I think it has been stated already in measure, and it is a very solemn thing. It is a shadow over the whole dispensation that a man may have gift and ability, even represent the Lord, and yet be a castaway. There may be a hidden allusion to the way the truth has come down to us. We have to admit that the truth has come down publicly through Rome, but that does not justify Rome or the whole profession either. The testimony is the testimony. The Bible has been preserved in Rome for ages, and the doctrine of it in some sense, but they are still what they are. The
{449}
Lord's supper came down in some public way greatly beclouded, but still it is the Lord's supper.
G.W. Is this set out in Peter when he speaks of being with Him on the holy mountain?
J.T. That is confirmatory of what we are saying; it is a further thought. The twelve are here, but only three are taken up to the holy mount, Peter, James and John, which would mean that there was still a further selection, so that the principle of invitation and selection runs right through and you have the very best for all purposes. If the Lord were to develop the truth in a collective way amongst His people He would select certain ones so as to get the truth, not so much for edification, but to get the truth; that is, the greatest measure of spiritual intelligence and hence the greatest result, in that sense. Peter, James and John are taken up to the mount of transfiguration, and later were fitted for services that others were not fitted for. The Lord commanded them to bring out the truth in a refined way, hence their epistles.
E.B.McC. Do we see how they all embody the spirit; of Christ, all being with Him when coming to the upper room in Acts? They were abiding there, showing that they had drunk in of His spirit and mind.
J.T. That is one of the first evidences that they were moving in the light of His instructions before the Holy Spirit came.
The gospel has the assembly in mind, but has also the patience of God with Israel in mind, so as to present a final testimony to Israel. The Acts also has the assembly in mind, and instead of telling us that the disciples went to the temple and praised God -- they were there daily -- Luke says they went to the upper room. The Lord was received up into heaven, showing that the more refined thought was taking effect already, looking towards the assembly. That
{450}
goes right through, because Paul was taken up to the third heaven, which is a further thought, and all that would enter into the final process, so that we should have the truth fully. The Holy Spirit is said in @John 16 to guide us into all the truth, but these are being fitted for the purpose, hence Paul was fitted for the mystery. No one else had the ministry of that.
C.F.I. What had you in mind in the power to heal diseases?
J.T. Power to heal in local difficulties is, I think, in mind now. It is a general thought here. Spiritual disease is often very prolonged.
J.R.F. Would it include dealing with an individual person and helping him to judge the condition that is manifest?
J.T. It would deal with an individual case, as in James. He gave the apostles power over all demons. "And having called together the twelve, he gave them power and authority over all demons, and to heal diseases, and sent them to proclaim the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick", @Luke 9:1,2. There is a difference between sickness and disease. Sickness may not be so severe as disease.
L.D.M. The word for power is interesting. It is not only ability but the right to exercise the power.
J.T. It is a question of the authority given. There is much made of the authority in the governing bodies of persons in the systems, but here it is directly from the Lord.
L.D.M. It would seem to be connected with demons particularly.
J.T. It says, "Power to heal diseases, and to cast out demons". "To heal diseases" @Luke 9:1 may not be there but it is certainly elsewhere. The principal matter here is demons, as you say.
A.M.H. Do you think the apostle Paul's letter to the Corinthians was on the line of healing diseases, something that spreads?
{451}
J.T. I think so. It seems to have been deep in the meetings. The one outstanding case is dealt with according to chapter 5, but there were others of similar kind.
C.F.I. Would this be in the way of bringing in positive ministry to meet a situation in the local meeting, or might it go so far as touching the details?
J.T. I think it would go as far as touching details. It is a medical case, and we have to make a diagnosis of disease.
C.H.H. Is it not of some importance that the healing comes before the casting out in the wording of the scripture?
J.T. There is a good deal of this sort of thing cropping up everywhere. The power to heal is of great importance. James speaks of it in a literal sense. Paul speaks of persons sick in a literal sense, and coming under the discipline of God. Many fall asleep, but then there is the idea of healing, too. Rather let it be healed. Is there any balm in Gilead? Is there any physician there? is a good suggestion. @Jeremiah 8:21.
C.H.H. Does it suggest that all power of the Spirit is to be exerted first on this principle of healing?
J.T. It is available and there is power for it.
F.W.W. Would you say there need not be any chronically sick?
J.T. There need not be. James says that the sick man is to call the elders of the assembly. Sins are likely to be involved, so they pray over him and the prayer of faith heals the sick. God does it actually, but by the prayer of faith.
W.H.W. Brethren in a locality where there is disease would not just accept the position, but be concerned about it in view of the power available to meet it.
{452}
J.T. Especially would they pray about it and anoint with oil, so that if the sick is to be raised up, he will be for the testimony.
W.H.W. Would the exercise of prayer in regard to a local difficulty find its expression in the local meetings for ministry?
J.T. There is usually the laying on of hands with it and the anointing with oil. Power comes out in connection with state amongst us, God honouring a certain state, but the assembly is brought into it, according to James, where it says, "Let him call to him the elders of the assembly" @James 5:14. We cannot say we have them now, but there is the thought of the prayer of faith, and the anointing with oil taken spiritually would mean that faith and prayer would raise up a man. It would act that way and they would be more useful, as a brother or sister, in the testimony afterwards.
W.H.W. In many cases we have to admit sorrowfully that one is taken note of as going this way. The prayers of the brethren do not seem to be answered, and the case will go the full course.
J.T. Paul says it went the full course at Corinth. It does not seem as if they exercised much prayer, because many were weak and sick amongst them, and many fell asleep, but the Lord would encourage us as to the state required for the healing of disease. Persons who have the assembly at heart, and who can pray to God, have nothing else in view but the testimony. The prayer of faith will heal the sick.
This matter of prophecy is now well under our notice, and it is really a very concrete expression of the power of ministry of that kind, under the presidency of Christ. It is brought in here to show how effective it is when there is special opposition to Christ, as in the messengers of Saul, who were murderers, Saul having murder in his heart. "They saw a company of prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as president over them".
{453}
That is the first thing to see, that sort of thing where it exists, for that is unified ministry carried on under the influence of Christ, who is in the place of authority over them.
J.R.F. Is Samuel in this position typical of Christ?
J.T. Clearly.
C.H.H. Is this to show how effective a powerful prophetic ministry is by the Spirit under the presidency of the Lord?
J.T. That is clearly, I think, something to be seen. The apostle speaks of seeing, and here prophecy is being carried on under the influence of the Lord. It is a fine sight. That is the first thing they saw, then they came under the influence of the Spirit, confirming what we have been saying that the Spirit may extend to persons who are not subjects of the work of God. The Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul and they also prophesied. We know from Balaam's case how this can happen, a thoroughly wicked man prophesying -- that is God bringing out what is possible.
E.W.C. Is this state seen here like the spiritual system functioning under the Lord?
J.T. Quite so. The word "president" would mean that, but it points clearly to the ministry being under His direct guidance and influence. What we get in @1 Corinthians 14 illustrates it. If one is prophesying, and another sitting by has received something, the one speaking would sit down, showing that he is subject. The Spirit is there and it confines the evidence under one authority -- they are not divided. "It was told Saul, and he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied". Then he himself comes, and he prophesied, but he is exposed in doing it.
{454}
F.W.W. Would this be an evidence of God being indeed among you (@1 Corinthians 14:25)?
J.T. I think very much so. You can see how Satan in this chapter was attacking David, Saul aiming at his destruction. Jonathan saved him temporarily, Michal saved him temporarily, but the ministry of prophecy saves him finally. That shows what the thing is.
F.W.W. The prophetic word in that way brings God in.
J.T. Exactly. One of the most remarkable things in scripture is this passage, and I think it bears on the present time in regard to unity in the ministry, brethren moving in unity and in subjection to Christ, and He having His part in it in presidency.
W.H.W. Would the help of Jonathan and Michal be like Nicodemus, who quoted the law in the synagogue to try and save Christ? That lacks elevation.
J.T. The great thing here is to see the presidency of Samuel. He is no longer officially a prophet, no longer ruling Israel; he is himself rejected, which is the position of Christ in the religious world. Although rejected, Samuel still has some place, which even Saul recognises, but not sufficiently to turn away his murderous attitude towards David.
C.H.H. How would that work out at the present time? Is it in the acknowledgment and movement under the headship of Christ?
J.T. We are trying to show that you accept rejection of Christ, not now the Jewish rejection but the religious rejection of today. Samuel has some place with Saul but not enough to turn away his murderous opposition to David. Samuel had to do with the governing of the kingdom, but he is not doing it now; Saul is in that place, and Samuel is retired in that sense, but not really retired, as a more important service is going on, the service of prophecy, and he has got the others in it; he has brought the others into it. That is what
{455}
the Lord is endeavouring to do, to bring us into this matter of prophecy, so that we are actually doing it, not ministry, but prophecy.
So the word is that the messengers of Saul saw a company of prophets prophesying; they were doing the thing with Samuel as president over them. They were not doing it as they might have done it at Corinth, where there was much rivalry over gift; the point is prophecy, and that is what they are doing here. They are under Samuel's direction and influence, and the persons who come, although representing evil, are themselves overcome by it. It is the surest way of meeting evil.
C.F.I. What do you mean when saying that it is not merely a matter of ministry?
J.T. You might minister otherwise than by prophecy. Here the prophets were doing the thing, like Philip's four daughters who prophesied, not simply that they were prophetesses, but they were prophesying.
F.F. Would prophecy in these saints overcome the voice of rebellion?
J.T. That is what comes out. The superior power of God would bring it out as they prophesied. It is the superior power that operates in brethren in overcoming evil.
D.R. Do we see unity here in Samuel and the prophets together with David?
J.T. That is the point. They are prophesying under Samuel's presidency; so in Corinth the apostle assumes that this is going on, that they are prophesying in the meetings there, and a man comes in who may be unconverted and the secrets of his heart are made manifest. If he went in and out without being affected, he might say there is not much in that meeting. I may go to the synagogue or any other so-called church, but the prophetic ministry affects me. The secrets of his heart are made manifest, not externally as in this case,
{456}
but he is affected inwardly and convicted of all, and falls down and worships God, and reports that "God is indeed amongst you". @1 Corinthians 14:25.
F.J.F. Would this character of ministry be seen in every meeting, because generally we have only a meeting of that character, for ministry, once a month?
J.T. Not that often in some places. Some localities have not got it at all.
F.J.F. Then he would get nothing.
J.T. Just so; not that the idea of God being felt in the meeting is restricted to such meetings as described in @1 Corinthians 14, but certainly the chapter is of great value from the point of view we are taking now. The brethren should have recourse to it and God will honour faith.
W.H.W. Is your thought that there is something to be seen here? If the enemy is opposing, the Lord would have something to counteract that opposition amongst His people?
J.T. That is right. They saw that here, and there is manifest power to deal with the matter.
R.J.S. It speaks of the whole assembly coming together in one place. Is unity emphasised there?
J.T. Quite so: not come together in assembly, but the whole assembly together in one place to bring out what God has in the place, and that is the power of subjective ministry. There is ability for it. God makes a great deal of a town and what He has in it. The Lord said to Paul, "I have much people in this city". @Acts 18:10. But that was not all; these people were to be converted and formed into an assembly, the full thought of God's power in the place. It is a question now of what God has in this city, and whether the city gets the benefit depends on whether there is power.
L.D.M. The scripture suggests what is for the saints universally, in the Lord's mind. The Lord is supporting that.
{457}
J.T. It is the sort of thing that enters in; all the assemblies should be characterised by the same thing.
F.J.F. Is a word of such character as here contemplated given as we are together, or is it in a sense carried there? Or does the Lord give it as here? They seem to come into the current of it, and they take it up.
J.T. The whole assembly coming together in one place certainly would carry something. The confirmation is there, but then the question is what one has. One has a psalm, another a teaching, a tongue, a revelation, an interpretation, but then as to this matter of a person sitting by, if something is revealed to him on the spot, that is one of the greatest things, it is revelation, because the Spirit given to us is the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of God. It is something coming to you at the moment. (@1 Corinthians 14:30). These things may seem merely theoretic now, but I believe the Lord would honour every meeting that takes them on while giving Him His place, and if we humbly wait the Spirit will act. How ready to act He would be in one of the brethren who is subject! He acted in an unsaved person in Numbers, Balaam.
F.W.W. What have you to say as to the great well?
J.T. I suppose it has a place as all wells have.
"Then went he also to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Sechu". That would be a reminder of the wealth that there is where the Holy Spirit is. We have already commented on the passage in the Acts, where the Lord spoke of the promise of the Father, but He had also spoken of the well, too, the Spirit as a well in the saints.
F.W.W. You spoke just now of some place with no meeting of this character. Do you think that this great well would encourage such a meeting?
J.T. I think so. "The whole assembly come together" would be the character of the well, that is the Holy Spirit in the assembly. It is a very great thought. The prophets are gifts, universal in thought, and the
{458}
great well would bring in all the saints, brothers and sisters alike, because of our being indwelt by the Spirit; the well should have that character.
F.W.W. Even the smallest meeting would have some spiritual wealth in the meeting.
J.T. Quite so; that brings every one into the matter, the whole assembly in one place. They bring something; they have the Holy Spirit and the character He gives to us, subjection and singleness of affection for one another. All that enters into the idea of the well. That is what Saul came to. Then he prophesied, but he is exposed in doing it. God is not letting him off.
F.J.F. So the prophet might himself feel his own word most.
J.T. Quite so; there were many at Corinth not let off. They might have had part in the service, but were exposed in the end, being false apostles.
E.B.McC. Would you say that one should not rise to his feet unless he had a word? And should anyone sitting by and listening rise without receiving something?
J.T. Certainly it would be a courageous matter to rise when another brother was speaking; but it is remarkable, it is the organism that is alluded to. Such sensitiveness would be in the assembly that if a brother sitting received something from the Lord in the meeting, the one speaking would sit down, and the other would rise up.
A.M.H. Does that make room for three words on different subjects? There is an idea that they should be on the same subject.
J.T. I do not think it is so, or we should be apt to get suggestive meetings. I think that something revealed to the one sitting by would be different.
A.M.H. I had thought that.

INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY
@Genesis 21:14 - 21; @1 Kings 19:1 - 8; @John 1:47 - 51
I have in mind to speak about individual responsibility. These passages are selected because they speak of this, and persons are mentioned in relation to certain shrubs or trees. What may appear to be incidental or of no practical moment in the divine narrative is very often in itself instructive, and so each of the growths mentioned in these passages has its own meaning.
That in connection with Hagar is a wilderness shrub, for she is in the wilderness. That spoken of in connection with Elijah is likewise a wilderness product, a broom-bush, a juniper tree. He also is in the wilderness. That with which the Lord connects Nathanael is a growth in the land of promise; at least it is so regarded. The fig tree is spoken of in Jotham's parable, as you will remember, as personified, giving an account of why it would not leave its function. It yielded sweetness. It was, as personified, regarded as consciously profitable, and would not leave its service to reign or wave over the trees. It is also spoken of as yielding its fruit in the land of promise visited by the spies, and its fruit was brought down as a witness to the profitable productiveness of the land of promise.
Hagar is ostensibly of the household of faith, now expelled from it under discipline, as many have been, and yet not forsaken of God. Discipline in the assembly does not imply that the persons disciplined are forsaken of God. If they are really His, He never withdraws His eye from them. The grossest case, that recorded in @1 Corinthians 5, is to be delivered "to Satan for destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus". @1 Corinthians 5:5 His spirit was valuable, (indeed our spirits represent ourselves in one
{460}
sense) and God has in mind that his spirit should be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. It was saved earlier, indeed generally it is so, for God does not intend His children disciplined to depart out of this world under a cloud. Some have to, for the wise government of God may require that, because they have been too much loved, too much indulged, to admit of recovery here. John says, 'I do not say that such an one should be prayed for', and again Paul says, "Many among you are weak and infirm, and a good many are fallen asleep", @1 Corinthians 11:30. Their course had continued so long and so inexcusably that the wise government of God required that they should depart under discipline. It is very humbling, but God makes no mistakes and acts in perfect wisdom in all these cases.
Hagar was a member ostensibly of the household of faith, but she was an insubordinate person who despised her mistress. She fled from her mistress and was found by the Angel by a well (@Genesis 16:7), a most suggestive thought, alluding figuratively to the Jews who in their insubordination disregarded the authority of Christ, although the Spirit was there available to them. So the well is there for Hagar. She could give no account of herself save that she was fleeing from her mistress. It was her own will. She despised her mistress, but she returned without giving much evidence of subjection. So that now she is expelled, she and her offspring Ishmael. She was a mother whose son despised Christ. Ishmael mocked Isaac; that is, he mocked when Isaac was made much of. The spirit of Ishmael may lie dormant in us until Christ is made much of. It is said of Michal, David's wife, that she loved David, but when he made much of Christ and danced before the ark she despised him in her heart, and so it was with Ishmael: he despised Isaac, he mocked him. He was born after the flesh, but being Abraham's son he was treated by God with the utmost care and consideration.
{461}
But I am speaking of his mother. She is sent out from the house of Abraham under discipline with much regret on his part, but he acts under the direction of God and Hagar has to go, never to return. That is a most solemn consideration for any who are disposed to mock when Christ is made much of. Children sometimes move in households of faith, but when Christ is made much of, when He receives His due in the household, they often mock and perhaps do more in the way of disrespect; but Hagar and her son are sent out of the household of faith never to return, and yet God has not given her up. He will do His best for her under those circumstances, and hence He speaks to her through the Angel.
She had cast the child under a shrub, relinquishing her care of him, but he was still an object of divine care, for God would do His best for a son of Abraham, for any one of Abraham's seed. Hagar relinquished her responsibility, not with any deliberation but out of stress of circumstances. The water in the bottle was gone. From her view there was no hope. She cast her son under a shrub. What could that do for him? How many of the Lord's people have acted thus in stress of circumstances. They have given way and relinquished their responsibility, and so the voice is, "Lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand". That is the secret of recovery, the secret of divine intervention, when responsibility in any given state of things is accepted, not relinquished. Anyone abandoning responsibility is good for nothing morally.
Hagar here has not gone into Egypt; she has not returned; she is in the wilderness; she has gone in there herself. Abraham did not tell her to go there. The wilderness in this connection implies that she is still regarding herself as someone out of the world. Many are like that and yet relinquish responsibilities. Wilderness experiences are nothing if we relinquish responsibilities, whatever the appearance. She was
{462}
wandering in it, as Israel later wandered about for forty years. He was under the discipline of God, but had the hope of the land, but she had no hope in her mind. It is a complete relinquishment of obligation. You are not going as far as taking up with the world in its gross side. Maybe you still hang behind the saints, and come to the meetings to please them; you may read your Bible occasionally; you have not apostatised; you are *wandering* in the wilderness.
The world has become a wilderness for christians, that is for those who belong to heaven. They belong to the land of promise. In going out of Egypt we have a definite end in view, for we are going into the land of promise. The wilderness comes in between; it is what the world has become to us. We accept that this world is a wilderness, for that is the divine thought, but Hagar had no such thought as that. She had left the land of promise, the household of faith. She was expelled from it, and yet retains her place in the wilderness, but she is wandering in it, has relinquished obligation and cast her son under a shrub, and there he is, a bow-shot away. Distance has come in already. Affection is given up. She cast her son under a shrub a bow-shot away from her.
Well, the Angel speaks to her. That is my first point. "Lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand". What encouragement there is to do this, for it says "God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is". You have cast him away under the shrub. You have sat down in despair and wept. There is no virtue at all in that, whereas God has heard the voice of the lad. He represents her responsibility, and God is hearing the voice of the lad where he is, and now the word to her is, "Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation". The blessed God
{463}
has an ear to hear the voice of distress. He hears the voice of the lad under the shrub where Hagar has put him. Hagar has abandoned him, but God has not abandoned him. Now He says, "Hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation".
I am speaking of responsibility, so that I might encourage someone perhaps who is disposed to relinquish it and throw up his hands as if all were over, whereas God would indicate to you now that all is not over. He is still active in grace, even with such persons as Hagar and Ishmael, both of whom in the sequel are found to be opposed to His interests, but now the Angel says, "God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is". He is worth taking into your hand; he is of value; he belongs to Abraham. As God said earlier, "Because he is thy seed". @Genesis 21:13. His ultimate history has not yet taken place. God is dealing with him in the light of Abraham. He belongs ostensibly to Abraham, and God will do His best for him, and He does. He says, "I will make him a great nation", but my point is not to enlarge upon Ishmael's ultimate history, but the importance, dear friends, of maintaining the sense of obligation whatever it may be. God acts with us as we accept it. "Lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand". God is going to do something for him, and He does, for Ishmael begat twelve princes, but what is said of him here is that he carries on in the wilderness, as it were. He represents those who have relations with the true brethren. He dwelt in the presence of his brethren, but in spite of God's favour he drifted towards Egypt. That however is not the point I would stress. The point is the acceptance of responsibility. As we accept responsibility, instead of relinquishing it, God is with us in every detail. What Ishmael became is in spite of the grace of God and because of what he was basically. He was born after the flesh, but nevertheless God is favourable to him as related to Abraham.
{464}
Well, now, this character of the wilderness is especially in one's mind, but Hagar is wandering in it, never to go into the land again as far as we know. In the wilderness without the land of promise as an object means nothing really. Her drift is towards Egypt. However much we may cleave to the right side, clinging to the brethren externally ("He shall dwell before the face of all his brethren", @Genesis 16:12), that is nothing really, unless one has the land in view. There is no purpose whatever in coming out of Egypt unless we have the land in view. I am speaking of it now because we are apt to cling to the idea of the wilderness without any prospect or desire for the land of promise. "He dwelt in the wilderness of Paran. And his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt". She had no thought at all of the land. I urge this point, because unless the land of promise is in our minds the wilderness is of no moral worth.
The next point is in the history of Elijah. You will observe in this chapter that Elijah has failed. He was a great servant of God, one of the greatest; Hagar was not that; Ishmael was not that. They are used tonight to show the importance of maintaining responsibility and how God works with us accordingly, but here is a person, engaged in the service of God and engaged in it most successfully, who now has fled from the scene of victory. Very solemn, very pathetic: he flees at the threat of a woman. The man that stood before hundreds of men and overcame them, God supporting him, now flees at the threat of a woman, Jezebel. You may say, 'Good reason, too', but why did he have good reason? The God that had maintained him before the prophets of Baal, and enabled him to overcome them and slay them, could still support him in the presence of Jezebel; but we are told that he fled for his life. Is his life more than the testimony of God? He goes into the wilderness, but he first goes to Beer-sheba.
{465}
That is another point to notice. Hagar did not go there. She went to the wilderness adjacent to it, but Elijah goes to Beer-sheba. His heart is full of fear of the woman who made a threat against his life, and he fled for his life, but the Lord says, "Whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it", @Matthew 16:25. Elijah is a great servant and is one of the most distinguished men mentioned in the Old Testament, as we all know. When with Moses he appeared on the mount of transfiguration what a distinction he had! He had light in his soul, whereas Hagar had none. God illumined her through His Angel, but she fled in darkness and confusion with no definite object at all, and yet they are the objects of God's care. Elijah understood something of Beer-sheba. It meant the faithfulness of God. That is what I would urge on everyone here. God is faithful. Elijah understood it, but failed to accept it in its fulness. He "will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able to bear", @1 Corinthians 10:13. Elijah was full of fear as to Jezebel instead of having a heart full of confidence in God, but still he flees to Beer-sheba. Jacob had gone that way before him, and then God appeared to Jacob, and said, "I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac", @Genesis 28:13. Isaac is the Yea and Amen of every promise of God.
Elijah leaves his servant at Beer-sheba. We think more of others than ourselves in such dangers. Why should he leave him there? Well, it was in order that he might enjoy the promises, whereas Elijah was not enjoying them. It was for him to rest in the faithfulness of God. Elijah was not doing that. He went deliberately a day's journey into the wilderness. It is the same wilderness in which Hagar wandered, but instead of a shrub Elijah sits under a juniper and goes to sleep there. It must have helped him in some way, for sleep is good in weariness. Sleep banishes
{466}
our sorrows; at least it may, but we do not hear of any dreams in this sleep of Elijah's. He awoke, and at his head was a cake baked and a cruse of water. Hagar met with mercy, too, but think of the mercy here -- a rest and sleep, and "a cake, baked on hot stones", as it should read, by the angel of God. There they were, with the cruse of water at his head, and the angel touched him. How beautiful all this is, dear brethren. It is not a Hagar now, but a great servant of God; but servants, alas, however great they are, are capable of failing. How solemn this is, but God never gives up and never undervalues His servants even although they do fail. He values them.
Elijah made a day's journey deliberately into the wilderness, and *sat*; he did not *cast* himself down, but he says to Jehovah, "O Lord, take away my life" -- a poor speech. Would it not have been better had he suffered the loss of his life by the hand of Jezebel than by the hand of Jehovah? You say, 'I would rather die by the hand of Jehovah', but dying by the hand of Jehovah is not a martyr's death. If I die under the discipline of God, that is not a martyr's death. If I wish to die, I should desire the death of a martyr for Christ. However, Elijah declared his mind, but instead of taking away his life, as he asked, God sets this cake freshly baked at his head, a full breakfast ready for him as he awoke. He lies down again and gets a second rest. This is all very beautiful, bringing out what God gives to His servants, those who love Him and serve him, although they fail.
Elijah still retains his responsibility. He is very jealous, he says, for Jehovah, and no doubt his jealousy for Jehovah would lead him to trust Him, for if he is concerned about Jehovah's interests God is concerned about him, making him two breakfasts. Elijah is not throwing in his responsibilities, and God values that, and I would urge all servants never to
{467}
relinquish responsibility, depressed though you may be. It is a very grievous thing to see a servant depressed or oppressed, but never relinquish responsibility, for God values that.
The angel touched him a second time. It is a divine touch; there is no other like it, and he says, "Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee". Divine compassion is now apparent; he ate again, "and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights". What food it was! How God made it to last! We cannot explain the material that is used, but it is God's, and the point is, dear brethren, that inasmuch as responsibility was there, God would have His servant to go the full length of what was in his mind, the full distance. He was to go to the limit, so that God might have the opportunity of speaking to his soul. He has left the juniper tree behind, and he took that journey. He was taken in divine strength. You ask, 'Divine strength, for him in unfaithfulness?' Yes, God would strengthen him to go the whole course, to go back to Horeb and resign the commission which he had carried out so acceptably.
God says, 'I will accept your resignation', but He does not say that to him under the juniper tree. He would let him go the whole length of his unbelief. That is most solemn. Elijah reaches Horeb the mount of God, and enters into a cave. God says, as it were, 'Now I have got My servant where I can speak to him, where he will understand what I say'. Horeb was intelligible to Elijah, but it would have been nothing to Hagar. The law had not been given, but I am speaking of principles. It would have been nothing to her. She, indeed, in type represents mount Sinai in Arabia, that is the great system that persecutes Christ, but mount Horeb is the mount of God, the same range of mountains but it is grace. Mount Horeb is the covenant mountain, and Elijah
{468}
would understand, as every christian understands, that God allows you to go the full limit of the course you have entered upon.
Then we have a whirlwind, a terrible sound of power, but Jehovah was not in that. He is not going to speak to you on those lines, but is giving you to understand the power He has. What could Jezebel do in the presence of a whirlwind or an earthquake? I am speaking to people here who understand to some extent what an earthquake is. What could anyone do to overcome it or check it in any way? It is the power of God, but the Lord was not in that. Then there is the fire, the most irresistible thing of all, "but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice ... . What doest thou here, Elijah?" God would cause us to tell the whole truth, and what was the truth? He said he was jealous for Jehovah. A journey to Horeb is nothing in itself unless it is undertaken in faith. Will I only go that far?
Much could be said about the evidences of divine power and the still small voice, but I am only speaking of the responsibilities that Elijah had accepted. Now God says, 'I accept your resignation, but I wish you to appoint three others to carry out the service'. God is not giving up, even if I am. Elijah is to appoint Hazael, Jehu and Elisha. All of this comes to pass, and the service of God goes on, and, indeed, Elijah himself is led on by God, such is divine grace. When it is a question of service to those who serve Him well, God is particularly gracious. Do not be depressed but trust, for God is good. "The same yesterday, and today, and forever", @Hebrews 13:8. What He was to Elijah when He first called him! He is the Same now.
Well, I go on to the fig-tree in John's Gospel. The Lord Himself tells us about this fig-tree under which Nathanael was. Had the Lord not mentioned it, I
{469}
assume it would not have been mentioned by John. When Philip called Nathanael we hear nothing of the fig-tree. The fig-tree comes into evidence in connection with Nathanael's interest in Christ. He is now interested in Christ, so that the fig-tree is really brought in here. It is a product of the land. Interest in Christ has the land in mind, and so the Lord says of him, "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!". The Lord said that as Nathanael was moving towards Him. He had at first scorned and despised what Philip said to him. Philip says to him, "We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph". @John 1:45. He says, "Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see". @John 1:46. Nathanael moved at that word, "Come and see". There may not be much to see today, but there is something; as he began to move the Lord looked out on him, as it were, and says, "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!". An Israelite, not a Jew. A dignified term, in keeping with the fig-tree and with the land of promise. The apostle Paul uses the term, "Israel of God", @Galatians 6:16 in connection with ourselves. We are enjoined as to it: "For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision; but new creation. And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace upon them and mercy, and upon the Israel of God", @Galatians 6:16. Let us take in that word, "the Israel of God". It belongs to the land of Canaan. We shall not wander in the wilderness as in that light. We go through it definitely having the land in our minds, and so Nathanael says to the Lord, "Whence knowest thou me?". The Lord says, "Before that Philip called thee", even *before*. There is something in that man before the gospel is presented to him. God had him in His mind. "Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee".
{470}
The use of the fig-tree in the New Testament unmistakably alludes to Israel. It had to be cursed at the last, but Nathanael was not cursed, he was blessed. A remnant was secured before the fig-tree was cursed, and Nathanael belongs to that, and so today the idea of a remnant helps. The Lord is looking out, and He sees this and that one under the fig-tree. Why under the fig-tree? It means something. It denotes a heavenly growth. The Lord says, "Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee", and Nathanael replies, "Thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel".
You see the difference here, dear brethren. It is one whom God has in mind for blessing, not a failing man, although he spurned the gospel at first regarding the question of Nazareth, but now he is ready for Christ. He is able to name Him. "Thou art the Son of God", how befitting; "Thou art the King of Israel". The Lord says, "Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, believest thou?" Yes. Well, the Lord says, "Thou shalt see greater things than these". I would address myself to everyone here. Your presence here indicates that you belong to this class.
The Lord would hold us as having come after Him. We have come to see. Nathanael came to see, and he saw the Son of God. I wonder if we have all understood that. He saw the King of Israel. You can see the difference between him and Hagar, and even between him and Elijah. Nathanael is ready for the greater things. The Lord says, as it were, 'You will see not only what you have heard spoken of, but greater'. He would encourage him as to greater things, and what a vista of glory opens up in this! The Lord could say to His brethren, so to speak, 'You are definitely small and even comparatively feeble, but you are engaged with the greatest things',
{471}
and the Lord would say to us, 'You will see greater things'. It is characteristic of John's Gospel, its increasing greatness, even in regard to the works of Christ. John would say, "The world itself could not contain the books that should be written". @John 21:25. Think of the greatness of that thought, even unwritten books. It is suggestive of what John has in mind and what he would instil into our hearts this night. You will see greater things. In another statement the Lord says, "Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man". That is a great thing, but there are greater than that. "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him", @1 Corinthians 2:9. These are all available for us now in the Spirit, but as made like Himself in glory what ability we shall have to take in greater things! "Our light affliction", says Paul, "which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory". @2 Corinthians 4:17. Think of that word, "eternal weight of glory". Are we to be crushed by it or overwhelmed by it? No. We are prepared for it. We are vessels of mercy fitted for glory, so that we can take in these great things the Lord speaks of here: "Thou shalt see greater things than these".

THREE POOLS
@2 Samuel 2:12 - 16; @John 5:1 - 9; @John 9:1 - 7
These scriptures speak of pools. Pools are divisions of water. Water, being the main provision of God for man, represents divine provision and as in pools it is within man's range so as to be usable. Man uses it thus and God too. Water is peculiarly a provision for God's use. He claims the sea: it says, "The sea is his, and he made it" @Psalm 95:5, that is the oceans, and God made them, He said. We will always remember this when travelling by sea. God especially claims a right to it. In fact it represents the immovable in its vastness and its depths. "They that go down to the sea in ships ... These see the works of Jehovah, and his wonders in the deep". They get into trouble. The storms arise; "They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man ... they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses", @Psalm 107:23 - 28. So that although they seem vast to us, the oceans are usable and God turns them to account to show how He can serve men, and it is as in trouble, as we are "at their wits¬ end", as it says, that we appreciate all the more the divine intervention, the divine relief. So they reached their desired haven. Such is God's use of such a great part of the area of this globe. He turns it to account to show how He can come in for man's relief, human relief. And then, "Let them give thanks unto Jehovah for his loving-kindness, and for his wondrous works to the children of men", @Psalm 107:31. So that God turns the oceans into service, into account, for the relief of men and for His own praise.
{473}
Now, as I said, pools are small divisions of water. Wells are still smaller, although more valuable in that they are always fresh, denoting what is vivifying in freshness. Pools may be stagnant but they still are usable for watering, irrigation, and so forth. They are usable; they influence, too. Water is of great influence on the earth, and pools are relatively of value in that way. This pool at Gibeon is called great. I wish to speak of how it was used at this particular time for sport. For sport! God never intended it for that. He has no interest in sports, and yet sport occupies men's minds almost as much as business, even more than family affairs. Warehouses make it the large portion of their business in sports¬ furnishings. I want to dwell on this, dear brethren and friends, because it is men's misuse of a divine provision. God bears long with men, and so allows them to proceed in their misuse of His creatures. For whilst every creature of God is good, many of them are misused and cannot be considered as sanctified. Thus the sports field is not sanctified. The fishing rod is not sanctified as used for sport. It must be extremely obnoxious to God that men should be using His living creatures for mere sport. It is said that Nimrod was "the mighty hunter before Jehovah!" @Genesis 10:9 a mighty one. There he afforded no pleasure to God. Nor is the football sanctified, nor is the gun sanctified as used in the woods and field for the destruction of God's creatures, miserable and selfish gratification, taking of the life of God's creatures. There will be no such thing in the millennium, nor will there be sports fields, cricket fields, or football fields. You say, 'Well, I did not come to hear the sports whipped like this'. But I do not intend that at all. If you *will* be a sportsman, 'Well', God says, 'let it go at that. If a man be filthy, let him be filthy still; if a man be wicked, let him be wicked still'. If a man will go in for what is contrary to Him,
{474}
well, let him; he will die and thus be lost. It is a matter of your salvation. I am bringing forward this side. This pool is the misuse of the creature of God, and seeing the terrible feelings that arose, you say it is sport. But then sport may become an occasion of bitter feelings, as in this case. Sport is a question of skill, of the strength and agility of the play. It is considered here the field of strength more; whether football, baseball, cricket, tennis, rowing, it is all a question of human strength and human skill. Without rivalry it would be nothing. The zest of it all would fall to the ground without rivalry. You can see, therefore, how God is left out of all this; it is outside of His realm, and I am speaking now to some young people who are sanctified, their souls and their lives, they are jeopardising their eternal welfare, disregarding God, disregarding the gospel, disregarding Christ, for their sports. So that here we have twelve Benjaminites, and twelve of the servants of David. Think of the servants of David devoting themselves to sport, twelve men on each side, men of strength! One of the leaders, Abner, says, "Let the young men now arise and make sport before us". Think of the state of Joab and of Abner, that they would order these sports, and such sports! They were not what we call harmless and merciful sports. Have sports never developed in your knowing to murderous and vicious feelings? Pugilism, wrestling, all these come under the head of sports.
I was in a certain town hall in a certain country in the south preaching the gospel, and on the floor below there was a wrestling match. Seven policemen were looking after the wresting match (there were no policemen watching the gospel). And as we came down; the policemen said, 'Up there it is heaven, down here it is hell!' I am putting the thing as it is. This world is taking God's creatures, what God has intended for good, and misusing them and,
{475}
in the misuse, stirring up the most dreadful feelings of rivalry. Every one of those twenty-four men lay dead in a few minutes from sport. Think of it! Where was God in all that? The servants of David were there; alas, real Christians are found there! But then, I am speaking of this pool to you, young people, lest you may be allowing your sport to interfere with your soul's salvation. As I was saying, sports afford more interest than almost anything that there is in the affairs of men. Hence young people get absorbed without thinking anything of the Bible, or of the preaching; they are after their sports even on a Sunday, as well as on a Saturday. Well, if there are those here in that case, I would say, Do as I have already commented; God says you may have it that way, and you will lose your soul, you will lose your salvation. It is waiting for you; it is here tonight for you. The gospel is salvation for all; it is where it should be; where it is sure; where it is available for every man, woman, and child on earth tonight, held in Christ, salvation that is in Christ Jesus. And I am urging this matter of sports lest any of you may allow yourselves to be tied to these sports, and God will some day say to you, 'You will remain that way; you will die a sportsman; having left Me out, you will die without Christ and you will be lost'. I am putting the thing in its worst form, for the Scriptures speak about bodily exercise, but I do not think that refers to sport. I am speaking of this pool of Gibeon which Abner and Joab turned into a sports-arena to the loss of the lives of twenty-four men in sport for their gratification. You see how the devil was in that, and is in sports today to keep young men and women occupied to the loss of their eternal welfare.
May I not appeal to you young people here? You say it may be hard for you. You look forward to Saturday afternoon. But that same Saturday afternoon
{476}
may rob you of your eternal welfare. It is not only Saturday but Sunday. What sports have turned Sunday into, a real sports-day; yet christians, even as we see here in the service of David, joining in, and Satan blinding the eyes of the youth, are occupied with wicked things to the loss of their souls. Gibeon was the great high place, we are told. That is, you may have a cathedral alongside of your sports field. In fact, some have dances and bowling-alleys in the basement of their churches. Think of the degradation of the name of Christ, as there with all this wickedness, to be minimised and whitewashed by the connection with the high place, for Gibeon was the great high place. The tabernacle was there. 'Well', you say, 'what harm is it? Here is the tabernacle right beside us, the tabernacle of Jehovah'. One killing the other, smiting him with the sword, and these twenty-four young men losing their lives in a minute! There is your high place, your cathedral, your church! So that they died on the spot. You see, dear friends, I am putting the thing in a strong way so that you may see what follows at this time and how God is preserving young people. Sports are for the moment, but the gospel preaches what is for eternity. "What does a man profit, if he should gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" @Matthew 16:26. What is a life of sports, nothing! It is a man's soul. God is proposing salvation to your soul. The sacrifice of God which is offered to you here tonight proposes to you the settling of things *tonight*. So that you may see the solemnity of what it is, allowing them to deprive you of what God has here for you, and how does He offer it? Through the death of Jesus. He died, "the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God" @1 Peter 3:18; that is the position. He is pleading with you now. Will you allow these
{477}
things, this pool of Gibeon, this sports field, to interfere with your eternal salvation? I would not go to audiences of the world and preach like this for a moment, but it is a question of warning young people that these things may deprive you of it. You cannot do without the salvation of God concerning His Son. He died, "the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God", @1 Peter 3:18 laying a basis for salvation and then going after you. He has here tonight come after you to secure you, so that you will be saved and not lost.
Now the other pool is in Jerusalem, and it is the religious pool. It is a neighbour to the sports pool; religion and sports go together, Religion has lost its true meaning. True religion is this: "to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, to keep oneself unspotted from the world", @James 1:27. But as treated today it is another matter, dancing and feasting in its halls and porches. That is the definition of this pool at Jerusalem. It is merely a question of humanity, the five porches. They are like the different religions in the world. 'We are all aiming at the same thing', they say. The gospel is preached, thank God. It is a great distress to me to see young people hiking off into the country and leaving the churches empty. But it is a sign of the times; God is given up. God visits these high places. How did we come out? Because God went in and got us out. He came down here once a year, we are told, in this scripture. In Jerusalem He came oftener to the temple in those days. An angel came down once a year and troubled the waters, but in all the porches people were lying, and only one got blessing each year. Think of all the poverty of that! One person getting saved in a whole year! That would indicate that God did not have much place in the things being spoken.
He is the Saviour God, and He is saving here; He can save where people let Him save! Hence it
{478}
is quite evident there was not much scope for God in this pool, once a year by His angel, but here is Jesus, God Himself, coming to this pool of Bethesda, for He came here to save. And here is a man who has been there for thirty-eight years. Jesus knew how long he had been there. He knows everything; He knows how long you have been in that church and have not been saved yet. I am not saying that to accuse the denomination. In fact, denominations have the Bible, the gospel, and God does go there, but He finds very little opportunity, very little scope, but still He goes there, and one in a year is saved. A century for a hundred persons to be saved! How many years would be needed to save all the lost on that basis? Now our Lord Jesus is here tonight; He is here spiritually in the gospel; the Holy Spirit is here among us to save. He knows how long you have been in that place; how long you have been in that denomination, and yet your soul is not delivered, and the Lord knows you have been there a good while. "Wouldest thou become well?" and the man tells his sad story. 'I have been always outrun, others are able to get down to the water, and I am paralysed, I cannot get there'. How long a time to stay there! Thirty-eight years already in that state and never get into the pool! No change in your soul's state. You are not a bit happier than you were years ago; not as happy, not realising that your sins are forgiven as you used to. How is this going to end? It may be thirty-eight years more -- think of the outlook!
The Lord is here tonight saying to you, "Wouldest thou become well?". Surely the man would be made well. The Lord by His words raised him. "Arise, take up thy couch and walk". The man did. That is what is proposed at this time; although you may be in one of the five porches, you are not as it were in fellowship in God's porch, but nevertheless God is ready to save you, to raise you up. You are making
{479}
no headway spiritually. You are silent. You are in the wrong place. The Lord says, 'I am here tonight for you. Will you be made whole? Are you ready for it?'. Some people often say, 'Well, I went to the preaching, but it did not do me good. I came out as I went in'. Was he preaching the gospel? 'He preached well, too, but I did not get any help; I am not going again'. Then the fault is with you! In @Matthew 9, two blind men are following the Lord and they ask Him to open their eyes. They were in earnest, but the Lord wanted to test them out. Are you here tonight in earnest; do you really want to get help? He went into the house and they followed Him in. You want to have your eyes open, but have you faith to have your eyes open? 'Yes, we have'. He touched their eyes and said, "According to your faith, be it unto you". @Matthew 9:29. But this person came to the preaching and got no help; he is not going again. It is a question of *yourself*. You are not really sincere in being here. You do not want the thing, are not set for the thing. If you have no faith, then you go out as you came in. These two men did not go out as they came in. "According to your faith, be it unto you", and their eyes were opened. You came in at somebody's invitation. I urge you all, sincerely; some day or another God will say, 'You knew all this, you never have been sincere; you have never really felt your need, and appropriated what I have provided in the gospel'. I could say more about this pool, but it stands alongside the pool of Gibeon, because it is a question of the high place. The religious pool and the sports pool are adjacent to each other.
Now we have the pool of Siloam, the real one, the one that represents all that is of God; it represents the work of God. The man who is blind is there waiting to be saved, to have his eyes opened. But it is the Lord's matter. Facing this meeting
{480}
from your point of view raises the question about the faith and sincerity you ought to have. So the Lord says, 'Now I want to present *My* point of view. I am engaged in the work of God'. "I must work the works of him that has sent me while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world", He says. God is facing this gospel from His point of view as well. It belongs to the work which He has been doing for over nineteen hundred years. Whether you are interested or not, the Lord is saying, 'This meeting is part of My work, part of what God is doing, and if anyone who is blind is here, his eyes can be opened, I will not charge one single cent for it, I am just here to carry on the work of God'. A very fine thought! The Lord goes on with His work here or we could never think, hear, or see. He fills out His day. So long as it is day the work must go on, *and it will go on*, and not for nothing, for something is accruing from it. So it says, "As he passed on", He saw the blind man. So tonight if one blind man is here, the Lord sees you. I am not asking you to do anything yet; He did not ask this man to do anything, until He put mud on his eyes. "Having said these things, he spat on the ground". It was the essence of Christ definitely in humanity. What a wonderful thought! Could there be anything greater? He put mud made of His own spittle on his eyes! He was blind already, now made worse, if possible, than ever. But that is the way the Lord works. We see He is working, because He works all He could in the daytime and He must carry on the wonderful works whatever people think or say. So He puts this mud on the man's eyes. The man is pliable, not repulsive, saying, 'You are making me worse!' It was a most extraordinary transaction. Think of the Person who is doing it! What material in that mud, the essence of Christ in humanity! It is a wonderful
{481}
fact that God came down into manhood and is here to serve you. He takes His own way to do it, a way you never thought of, that you may be whole again. The man allowed the Lord to plaster his eyes with mud; he is a self-judged man. No sports field, no high place; just purity and simplicity, a pool available to God, and God uses it. He plasters the man's eyes, 'Now go to that pool. Do not rebel, do not question'. The Lord Jesus is speaking to you. 'Go, wash in the pool'. Think of that man going down the streets of Jerusalem plastered with mud! Suppose Michael, the archangel, saw him on the street, how he would understand! Oh, the magnitude of the transaction, God was acting! It was His work! Never would a man have thought of putting mud on a man's eyes, but it is more than mud! He is still at the pool. What would that pool mean? By its interpretation, 'Sent'. We all like to give command instead of obeying. The gospel is for obedience of faith and this man is equal to it. So he is thus met on the streets of Jerusalem. How did he get down to the pool? Scripture does not say, but it does say that he got there. And having got there, he went into the pool. You can understand how you would feel if you met that man now and saw his eyes plastered with mud. The more dignified word for the transaction is 'anointed'. The Son of God did it. But these would say to that man, 'You are a sight!' Let me be under reproach. It is better to be under reproach than to be blind for ever; it is worth it to get my eyes opened. He was sent, 'I am under orders'. Let me tell you there is no salvation unless you accept orders. Young people do not like to accept orders. But never mind, the Lord will say to you, as He said to Saul, 'Go to the brethren'. The Lord outside of Damascus could have told him everything, but "Enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do", @Acts 9:6. Many
{482}
young people do not like to obey. They like to have their own way and do not like to be under reproach; they would rather remain blind! Not so this man. He went to the pool of Siloam, which means 'Sent', and he washed, and he saw. He "came seeing". He came back again. Would to God some may come back again! "Enter into the city"; you despise the brethren? Well, if the Lord will do it, you have to go to the brethren, too. "Enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do". @Acts 9:6. The Lord guided him into the city. The Lord told Ananias what to do, and Ananias told Saul, but in all the doings Saul was saved, but how did he come into things? By obedience. "Obedience of faith" @Romans 1:5, not only obedience to the Lord, but obedience to the brethren, to the authority that the Lord has placed in the assembly. Rebellion against the brethren is rebellion against the Lord, so that is damage to your own soul.
This man went, and came back seeing. May God grant that we shall find someone like this after this meeting, someone getting clear, subjecting himself to God, to Christ, and to the brethren; light and guidance; 'I see it all'. The man said to his neighbours, "Having gone and washed, I saw". @John 9:11. He told the Pharisees, "I washed, and I see". @John 9:15. There is a great deal more about these pools, but this is the most interesting of all because it is the pool that God uses. The Lord Jesus is the Worker and the man's eyes are opened; he came seeing. Now the religious people cast him out. They did not cast the man out in chapter 5; he was in the temple, he was a different kind of convert. He was a convert that was going to stay where he was. He was not going to be a true disciple at all. We cause the Lord Jesus suffering when we are not genuinely out on the Lord's side. "Sin no more, that something worse do not happen to thee". Become a real disciple; you may lose what
{483}
you have and become a worse disciple. This man is cast out. When the Lord heard he was cast out, He did not say, 'Sin no more'. He had been faithful in the testimony and had been cast out for the testimony. The Lord found him. 'I want you for ever', He would say. He is suffering with Christ for the testimony. He wants you for His service. 'I want you to believe in Me, the Son of God', and he worshipped Him. That is what God intended. That is the real result of genuine conversion. It is addition to Christ, a true worshipper. That is what this man became. It is a genuine case. He gives God the glory. He is outside of all man's affairs; he is entirely subject, he gives a full account of it, and the Lord finds him there. He will be with Him for ever. The next chapter speaks about the flock. He is one of the sheep of Christ, put into that flock to be in it for Christ for ever.
{484}
LOST ONES AND FOUND ONES
@2 Corinthians 4:3; @Luke 19:9,10; @1 Corinthians 1:18; @Isaiah 46:13
In my remarks I wish first to speak about *lost* people; then about *saved* people; then where the salvation is which the saved ones enjoy (for enjoyment is part of christianity), and that enjoyment, or the means of it, will be a little beyond the accredited religions of this world, for it affords true joy.
Now I spoke of lost people, and there are two classes of lost ones; the first class, not to be saved, and they never will be; then there are the lost that will be saved. I hope there are none of the first class here. This may be a puzzle to some of us. I am not saying that the first class are elected to be lost, but *they do not get saved*, "But if also our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in those that are lost", @2 Corinthians 4:3.
As to the Corinthians the facts show that they must have had extraordinary times. Gospel meetings are not the least enjoyable of our meetings, especially if Paul preached, or Silvanus, or Timotheus. There may have been three preachings at one time there in different places, for they all preached the Son of God; it was a threefold testimony. "But when God ... was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations", @Galatians 1:15,16. So we are all pupils in that way. What freshness there would be about Timotheus or Silvanus in preaching to the Corinthians!
The Lord had said, "I have much people in this city", @Acts 18:10. Nowadays the census might tell us the number of inhabitants there, but the Lord had said that *He had much people in this city*.
In @Luke 15 the woman took the candle and searched diligently for the lost piece of silver, and the very best searching would be through Paul's
{485}
preaching. They were not yet saved, but they were *His*, and these three men were seeking them, Paul, Silvanus and Timotheus, and the Corinthians were being saved. The Lord said, "I have much people" here. Paul stayed a long time, one year and six months, in that city to get the "much people" God had there. He preached the "Son of God". So Paul could say, "For we are a sweet odour of Christ to God, in the saved and in those that perish", @2 Corinthians 2:15. Paul's was the best gospel preached under heaven! But, alas! there is that class who perish. God forbid that there are any here tonight. Yet if any go out of this room unmoved by the gospel we might think of you as *lost*, as we read in @2 Corinthians 4:3, "But if also our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in those that are lost". You may think that you have hope as long as you live, and that is the truth indeed; yet the truth brings things to light, and solemnly, too. Do *I* belong to that class? God might use that thought of being lost to reach your conscience, *to make sure that you are not in the class of being lost for ever*, so that you might be saved. That is what we desire tonight. People are so shallow now, and trivial. I hear a young man or a young woman, a boy or a girl, saying, 'I will wait until I am out of school!' The thought may elude you then! If it does, and you are not saved, "The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved" @Jeremiah 8:20, then you are among the lost! The prophet is speaking to *you* in this verse. The devil has his way with you. The devil blinds the eyes of the unsaved; he is especially concerned in regard to *your* eyes. The eyes are very delicate members; the oculist tries to save the eyes, but the devil blinds their eyes: "He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, that they may not see with their eyes, and understand with their heart and be converted, and I should heal them", @John 12:40.
{486}
So it becomes manifest that you are lost. 'While there is life there is hope' is not altogether true. You would not preach to Judas after he had betrayed Jesus, nor should I preach to the antichrist! It is a terrible thing to say, but it is the truth, and shallowness is one of the features of professed christianity. John says in @Revelation 22:11, "Let the filthy make himself filthy still". If I am filthy, if I have a radio or a pipe, God says, 'Keep on with them'; the time comes when He says that. It says also in @Revelation 22:11, "Let him that does unrighteously do unrighteously still"; that is one who is a thief, or one who does not pay his debts, the Spirit of God speaks severely of such. Is there anyone here saying, 'I do not think that is the truth'? But it is most solemn, and intended to wake us up. God forbid there should be anyone like that here. Do not deceive yourself, for it *is* the truth. Paul says that if there is anyone from whom the gospel is hidden, the devil is doing that, that is, if you are not saved. But another person, who may be beside you, is a believer in the gospel, and I hope I hear him saying, 'I will not put it off'; he is thus "a sweet odour of Christ to God" @2 Corinthians 2:15, for he is separated to God, and his soul bows to the truth.
Now I go on to what is said of a man who was lost but may be saved, that is Zacchaeus. The Lord says, "The Son of man has come to seek and to save that which is lost", @Luke 19:10. The Lord was speaking of what belonged to Him, and the Lord was seeking him. The Lord has much people in this city of Chicago, like the people at Corinth who received Paul's preaching, but think of being one of those shown to Paul in the vision, think of being known before God as a saved person! The woman is sweeping the house to find you! What a joyous time they had at Corinth, what wonderful opportunities, the woman sweeping the house and finding the lost piece of silver! Matthew says they are hard to find. The "if" in @Matthew 18:13 is very
{487}
solemn, it says, "If it should come to pass that he find it". @Matthew 18:13. There is no trifling with the Shepherd's service, for there is a possibility of the Shepherd not finding you; you are off in the theatre or in the gambling house; but "If ... he find it": so do not get out of the radius of the sun's shining, keep within the radius of the truth; do not fail to be at the gospel meeting. The Shepherd may come to your father's house, and perhaps you, a boy of fourteen, are not there. Where are you? Your parents may not know where you are. These large cities are like dark forests. You are in the atmosphere of great darkness, of sin and iniquity; you cannot *expect* the Lord to go there, though He *may* go there! But keep in the light. Remember "If ... he find it"; there should be no 'if' on your side; *be sure*! You are in the way of it here in this room. The Lord is sure to be here, and surrounded, as you are, by sympathetic feelings, too, in the brethren. So He finds the sheep, and "He lays it upon his own shoulders, rejoicing; and being come to the house, calls together the friends and the neighbours, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my lost sheep", @Luke 15:5,6. The longest psalm, @Psalm 119, fits in with these scriptures; it says in the last verse, "I have gone astray like a lost sheep: seek thy servant" @Psalm 119:176.
God loves to have you put in your bills. "As children of obedience", Peter says (@1 Peter 1:14). Paul says, "Honour thy father and thy mother, which is the first commandment with a promise", @Ephesians 6:2. So you can put in your bill; it has a promise; it is in the way of things; God values it, and honours that bill! Do you feel that you are a lost sheep still? God says that is good that you feel it; God finds you; the Shepherd finds the sheep, and there is "joy in heaven for one repenting sinner", @Luke 15:7. Perhaps we have omitted too much of it, for He says, "Rejoice with me" @Luke 15:6; all of us love to rejoice when one is brought home amongst the brethren. Zacchaeus is one of them,
{488}
lost for the moment, yet he is found; the Lord says of him, "He also is a son of Abraham", not 'shall be' but "is"; yes, a mere tax-gatherer! In @Luke 13 there is "a woman having a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and she was bent together and wholly unable to lift her head up", yet the Lord says of her, "Who is a daughter of Abraham" @Luke 13:11,16. Wake up, young people, the thing is for you! A young man said to me that he had heard people say, 'I am heir to a great fortune', and he did not think it was true! But if there is anyone here who is saved, a son or daughter of Abraham, you are heir to a great estate. It is yours! Each person has something distinctive; you are heir to an immense estate. If you are not in the good of it, you have not accepted Christ. And for those who accept Christ, they have the Holy Spirit as the earnest of their inheritance: "God, who also has sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts", @2 Corinthians 1:21,22. We have the Spirit to draw upon in this waiting time. He is here, with us and in us. The Lord says, "Inasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham", not 'going to be' but "is"; Zacchaeus said, "If I have taken anything from any man by false accusation, I return him fourfold", @Luke 19:8. Was he a son of Abraham then? Yes; in a false position, yes, and still lost, but he belongs to God. So the Lord speaks of His own property, "I have much people in this city". @Acts 18:10.
You hear the gospel; Paul says, "My glad tidings", @Romans 16:25. There was no preacher like him, except the Lord; he could say, "I ... have fully preached the glad tidings of the Christ", @Romans 15:19. So these Corinthians were saved through the preaching, and they had received the earnest of the Spirit in their hearts, and you, as sealed by "the Holy Spirit of promise" @Ephesians 1:13, in thus receiving Christ as now presented to you as the One who came to seek the lost, you find you are heir to this great estate. After you are endowed with the earnest you will have plenty to live
{489}
on; you will be an honest working-man. A christian's face is bright; the presence of the Spirit implies that. So Zacchaeus has marks of that. "He sought to see Jesus who he was". Some read of Napoleon, or other great men, their lives, acts and so on, but Zacchaeus "sought to see Jesus who he was". The Lord came into his house, and He says, "To-day salvation is come to this house, inasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham; for the Son of man has come to seek and to save that which is lost", @Luke 19:9,10. He *is* a son of Abraham, not lost now, never again to be so, but saved. So Paul says, "To us that are saved", @1 Corinthians 1:18. What is a saved person like? There are plenty who would like to be saved, but Paul speaks of those who *are* saved. Look at Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, and Peter, and many women! Peter says, "Look on us", @Acts 3:4. If you are exercised the Lord would say to you, "Come and see", @John 1:39 as if to say, 'You cannot get up to heaven, but just come and see'. A saved person is not quarrelsome and ambitious, but satisfied. "The trees of Jehovah are satisfied", @Psalm 104:16. His face shines; he *is* what he presents to others.
"To those that are called ... Christ God's power and God's wisdom", @1 Corinthians 1:24. Are *you* ashamed of the cross? Some young ones go to school and hide the light, but "the reproach of the Christ" is "greater riches than the treasures of Egypt", @Hebrews 11:26. The "word of the cross" @1 Corinthians 1:18 saves us; it is "Christ God's power and God's wisdom". @1 Corinthians 1:24.
In @Isaiah 46:13 the Spirit of God says, "I will give salvation in Zion, and unto Israel my glory". @Isaiah 46:13. Think of that word 'Zion'! God says, "Here will I dwell, for I have desired it", @Psalm 132:14. It is most necessary to open your hearts to God; He would dwell there: "I have desired it". It is not heaven; literally Zion is a mountain, and a small one, too, but it is what God selects. It is the hearts of people; they are "vessels of mercy", @Romans 9:23. God has got into their hearts;
{490}
"Here will I dwell, for I have desired it". @Ephesians 2:19 says, "So then ye are no longer strangers and foreigners, but ye are fellow-citizens of the saints, and of the household of God". Salvation is there, and the place is there, "in Christ", @Ephesians 1:3. The salvation of God is *fixedly in Christ*, where love is!
Some have no home and say, 'Nobody loves me!' All heaven is open for you. Over one sinner that repents there is joy in heaven, *now* and presently on earth, too; that is Zion. God wants them there also. "For Jehovah hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his dwelling", @Psalm 132:13. Joy unspeakable is your portion, which increases as it goes on. Think of the lavishness of the giving where God dwells! May we think more of it! Do not put it off! Make it a settled matter before you close your eyes tonight!
