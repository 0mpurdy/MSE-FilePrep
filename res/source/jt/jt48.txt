SPIRITUALITY(1)
@Exodus 17:1 - 16
J.T. The subject proposed is, I may say, cumulative, and it is essential to the completion of certain lines of truth that have been before the Lord's people for some years; doctrines and principles all bearing on the service of God. *It is thought that spirituality, as the Lord may help us to consider it, will be seen as essential to the application of what has been before us* . We are told that which is first is natural, afterwards that which is spiritual. So that the spiritual is the final thought, that is, it enters into the final thought of God, our eternal portion, and we ourselves will be marked by spirituality; as raised, our bodies will be spiritual, or if quickened, as alive and remaining when the Lord comes, they will be spiritual. So that in view of our final portion -- our being with the Lord -- it seems that this subject should be formally looked into.
Then as regards the present time, in the epistles to the Corinthians, which are corrective and instructive as to the service of God, the subject of spirituality is stressed. The apostle says to the Corinthians, for instance, that he could not speak to them as unto spiritual, a very humbling thought; he had to speak to them as unto babes in Christ: that is, they had the full Christian status, but were wanting in spirituality and hence were depriving themselves of the best and most blessed thoughts of God.
One need not say that this latter thought is solemn, because unless spirituality be developed, however much we may take things in mentally, we are not really profiting by them, and perhaps we may be better off without them; but, as having them, it is obvious that we
{2}
should have before us this matter of spirituality. Then as to administrative service -- of which there is much need in our care meetings, and assembly meetings for discipline -- spirituality is a leading necessary feature; it shuts out personal feelings in these matters. Paul's word to the Corinthians is that "the spiritual discerns all things, and *he* is discerned of no one", @1 Corinthians 2:15. That is, in the administration of divine things the principle of the mystery is always present, everything is not compassed, especially as to those under discipline, they are unable to discern. The spiritual man retains inscrutability in measure; he is discerned of no one, so that the dignity of Christianity is maintained in these administrative matters by spirituality. In Galatians the restoration of erring ones depends on spirituality; "ye who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness", @Galatians 6:1. With all this in view it seems to me it would be wise for us to look at the subject from the foundation in the types, and I believe that is properly in @Exodus 17.
In @1 Corinthians 2, spirituality stands related to the Spirit of God in a personal way. It is a subject brought in as developed out of faith and the Spirit of God. In John's gospel we have the foundation of it bearing particularly on our own times, that is new birth. "That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit", (@John 3:6). That is what I understand to be the fundamental thought in us; it is constitutional, not exactly what we have received through our minds, but what God effects sovereignly as fundamental in our constitutions. Those who grow up ostensibly in the truth, without bearing in mind this fundamental thought, are usually defective, so that the chapter read, I believe, deals with the matter first as rooted in the sufferings of Christ, which were essential in order that we may have the Spirit; the Spirit being viewed here as received through the sufferings of Christ.
{3}
The chapter begins with an allusion to the commandment of Jehovah as governing the teaching in it, and proceeds to tell us of the people contending with Moses because there was no water. The battle of Rephidim, which follows, has in mind the state in us seen in @Romans 7, which requires elucidation if this matter of spirituality is to be reached intelligently. The matter of God's sovereign act as fundamental to our chapter contemplates the elucidation of conditions *within* us; the law being the instrument, divinely provided, to lead us to this analysis, without the understanding of which none of us shall ever reach Christianity in a spiritual sense. In general that is what one had in mind.
F.J.F. Is the Spirit received directly from God by each individual who believes, or as a consequence of the Spirit being here in the body?
J.T. It is the gift of God. It is always the direct gift of God and never automatic, as far as I understand; but the Spirit is given as already here in the assembly.
J.D. Does @Ephesians 1:13 help -- "in whom *ye* also have trusted, having heard the word of the truth, the glad tidings of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise"?
J.T. Yes, the "word of the truth". That is where the difficulty lies in many. Very few believers, brought up under defective teaching, have the Spirit operating in them, as far as I have observed. This is because they do not get the "word of the truth" which is an adjusting thought as to our souls. That is always necessary in view of the reception of the Spirit. The apostle alludes there to @Acts 19, in which we are told that there were twelve men at Ephesus who had had imperfect instruction -- what related to the baptism of John; they were persons, such as are very prevalent today, brought up under defective teaching; truth to a point, but not
{4}
the whole truth; not such as "the glad tidings of your salvation" (@Ephesians 1:13) implies. So that the apostle gives us a lead in that chapter as regards the Spirit, saying, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?"(@Acts 19:2) The men said they had not heard of Him as come.
A.M.H. Does @Exodus 17 indicate how far souls may go without having received the Spirit? There was faith in relation to passing through the Red Sea, @Hebrews 11:29; but the smiting of the rock and the coming out of the water, alluding to the Spirit, followed this.
J.T. That helps, because it is a question of the commandment of the Lord. This position is reached by the commandment of the Lord; meaning that it is imperative that we should come to this point in our souls. We read in @1 Corinthians 10:4 that they had all eaten the same spiritual food and drunk the same spiritual drink; they drank of "a spiritual rock which followed them". This is what is alluded to in the spiritual drink; the rock comes into view here; but the position is marked by divine commandment. The gift of the Holy Spirit is from God's side. It is essential to Christianity; to our being in it rightly. Verse 1 says, "at the command of Jehovah ... they encamped in Rephidim". I believe this is to be noted specially, because there is with many the feeling that divine things are optional; this is especially so in young people; whereas it is a divine commandment that we should reach this point.
E.E. It is imperative then for us to move under the control of the Lord, that we might come under the effect of His sufferings and thus be instructed in view of our having the Spirit.
J.T. Yes. God gives the Spirit to those who obey Him, @Acts 5:32. Peter says, in @Acts 2, in answer to those who were convicted, "Repent, and be baptised, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy
{5}
Spirit"(@Acts 2:38). The promise was to them, but later he says that God gave the Holy Spirit to those who obey Him, as said above.
H.J.M. Is it not very attractive that the original word for commandment is "at the mouth of Jehovah"? It should make an added appeal.
J.T. A practical word from His mouth. That is, there is nearness in it.
H.H. You have referred to Pentecost, when the Spirit was given as the promise of the Father; have we to appreciate that the Spirit is on earth in relation to divine interests?
J.T. Quite so. He is not given now directly from heaven as He was given at Pentecost. He was "sent from heaven", we are told, (@1 Peter 1:12), and *is here* so that the believer comes into what is already here, and he is set in the body by the reception of the Spirit, but still every believer has a transaction with God, and God with him, as the Spirit is received.
F.J.F. Is it that it is given directly from God to the believer?
J.T. That is what I understand.
F.S.W. We are told in @1 Corinthians 10 that God was not pleased with most of those who came out of Egypt. Would that suggest that there are many amongst nominal believers in whom God is not pleased, because they have not the Spirit?
J.T. Exactly. The apostle is dealing with the profession of Christianity in which many would not have the Spirit, which is so today; hence the importance of obedience. This is an imperative matter, so that in order that we should have the Spirit, Christ had to suffer; He had to be smitten. God does not express resentment at the people's murmurings. He deals with Christ in regard of it all, for He would intimate to young believers that Christ would undergo sufferings, so that they should have the Spirit.
{6}
F.I. Is spirituality seen in Joshua as the one who was able to overcome Amalek? And then Moses is on top of the hill with the staff of God. Typically, Christ is above.
J.T. That is where the conflict begins. The conflict is from verse 9; Moses says, "go out, fight". The battle must result in victory for Amalek unless we recognise the Spirit; hence the early part of the chapter is basic from the divine side. What appears from verse 9 to the end is what transpires in our souls; so that victory is reached in an experimentally spiritual way. The law comes into this, although it is seen more fully in @Numbers 21, but the writer of @Romans 7:14 says, "the law is spiritual: but *I* am fleshly", There is a battle inwardly between what is spiritual, and what is carnal. What is spiritual prevails; the victory therefore is spiritual. It implies the introduction of a spiritual element into one's being, an operative spiritual element and, as augmented by other elements seen here, it prevails. The law is spiritual. Why should there be a law? It came in, in order to work out the great thought of sin, "that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful" -- *exceeding* sinful, (@Romans 7:13). It has been worked out in the history of humanity. The book of Revelation shows how it will appear later on, and God is patiently waiting until it is fully developed before He strikes. It is the history of humanity without God, but it becomes *exceeding* sinful in the believer. The thing is worked out in the believer on the same principle. That is the thing to get at in our souls -- the judgment of sin, not only sin normally, but the *exceeding sinfulness* of it. The operation of the law, being spiritual from this point of view, develops this.
F.W. Is it the answer in our souls to the sufferings of Christ?
J.T. Quite so, that we might know what caused them, that each had his part in it.
{7}
E.E. Does smiting in scripture always involve death? What would be the character of the Lord's suffering here in being smitten. Is it in connection with the principle of sin in us?
J.T. The context shows that the death of Christ is meant in this type. Smiting is applied to Christ several times, involving His death, @Matthew 26:31. We could not have the Spirit except Christ had died. The Lord said on the cross, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"(@Matthew 27:46) But sufferings alone would not suffice; there must be the termination judicially in death of the man that sinned, and the more I discern the exceeding sinfulness of sin in that man -- that is, in myself - the more ready I am to abandon him, and to see the necessity of his being brought to a termination. The first cry on the cross, I believe, is that the wrath of God was felt in the Lord's heart, and He says, "why hast thou forsaken me?" (@Matthew 27:46) The second cry is the termination of the man, for, having uttered it, the Lord actually died. There were two cries.
J.D. @Romans 7:25 says, "I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then *I myself* with the mind serve God's law; but with the flesh sin's law". Is "Jesus Christ our Lord" here an experimental expression?
J.T. It is an objective thought. The writer is dealing with what is subjective: what is going on in himself up to that point, and finds he is helpless to overcome sin in the flesh. The law has only accentuated it and made it more powerful, and he is correspondingly all the weaker, so that he is helpless and in despair. Hence the objective thought, "I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord" (@Romans 7:25). That involves the work of Christ, it involves His death and His resurrection. Really it is Christ viewed as "made ... Lord and Christ", with the consequent result of relief for men. So that as a result, one is now to exercise his mind. One of the greatest
{8}
things is to see that I have control of my mind; that it has not control of me. "I myself", that is the ego and its consciousness. I am consciously there in deliverance, and I have control of my mind and I start to make resolutions which enter into the moral fibre of the believer. I myself with the mind serve God's law, whatever that may be.
E.S.W. Does the action of Phinehas in @Numbers 25 correspond with the smiting of which you have been speaking? When the grave sin of Israel came to view, he rose up from among the assembly, and took a javelin and destroyed those who had been guilty.
J.T. It is the principle of dealing with sin effectively. He smote them both, the two sinners.
W.B.P. Is not the smiting in @Isaiah 53:4 from God? God was the smiter, here it is from Moses.
J.T. There is a question of Moses¬ *rod* -- Moses represents God in the type -- it is a question of the rod that he used. Verse 5 says, "And Jehovah said to Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel, and thy staff with which thou didst smite the river, take in thy hand, and go". He represents the authority of God. Then verse 6 says, "Behold I will stand before thee there upon the rock on Horeb; and thou shalt strike the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so before the eyes of the elders of Israel". That is to say, it is God's authority exercised visibly before the elders. It is a question of the responsibility of the people; the elders being there, Jehovah is there also. The smiting is Moses¬ part, but it is the rod of God. The rod by which He dealt with the world, represented in Egypt, is now the rod that is used against Christ typically. There is no drinking mentioned here; it does not say the people drank, because it is to show typically the bringing in of the Spirit, who is here through sufferings; but still there is a suggestion that the Spirit is available.
{9}
The battle is to bring out the state of our souls, the state inwardly that had to be discerned so as to reach victory.
J.M. Would faith enter into all this?
J.T. We see faith in the end of chapter 14; faith had begun already; they "believed in Jehovah, and in Moses his bondman (@Exodus 14:31)". Faith must precede this, but now it is a visible thing done before the eyes of the elders by the hand of Moses who represents the authority of God. What had been used against the world is now used against Christ on account of the state of the people, and in order that they might have the Holy Spirit.
W.J.H. Is your thought that all this comes into "the word of the truth", the acceptance of separation from Egypt and the acceptance of the judgment of sin in the flesh?
J.T. That is exactly what I thought when our brother quoted from @Ephesians 1. It is the gospel of our salvation, but it is the word of the truth, involving that what we are is made clear, and, of course, what God is in Christ.
H.J.M. Speaking of the experimental side, and the remark as to the expression, "Jesus Christ our Lord", the moment the soul, looking outside himself, really says that, he is in touch with the spiritual realm.
J.T. That is what I was thinking. The battle, the conflict here implies @Romans 7. Historically the law had not yet come, and we have to wait for @Numbers 21 to see how it works for the exposure of sin in the flesh, and how perfectly it is dealt with in the death of Christ. Amalek comes up in verse 8, and fights with Israel in Rephidim. It is this particular place, the battlefield being chosen by Jehovah. We are not at any disadvantage in it. It is a selected battlefield, but nevertheless a real conflict and the issue for a while is uncertain. Moses directs Joshua. This is the first time we have
{10}
Joshua, and that is why the passage is selected, because it is the introduction of what will culminate in the eternal state of things. That is, the spiritual state first, and then the spiritual body. Here it is a question of divine *authority*, God taking the initiative through Moses. He says to Joshua, "Choose us men". It is a collective matter in that sense and even Moses himself is in it. All heaven, the whole economy of God, is in this matter, so that we should be ready to realise the presence of the Spirit in the victory. What comes out are elements that are not mentioned before, such as the uplifting of Moses¬ hands and the support of his hands by Aaron and Hur, also the stone on which he sat. So that as the battle goes on, every exigency of it brings out the remedy -- brings out the provision to meet it. Thus one is encouraged to move on, knowing that however severe the conflict, victory is assured.
J.M. Would that represent intercession?
J.T. It is intercession, but in the economy, as it were, otherwise these weak elements would jeopardise victory. They are occasioned by the state of our souls. If you look at the economy from the divine side there is no weakness, and the Spirit is here also looking after our state. It is a state of great weakness, but yet a provision comes as need arises, that victory may not be snatched from us.
It is a question of intercession, but our weakness in these circumstances is stressed. You are hardly realising what there is provided of God for you in the place occupied above. That is the real difficulty, so that faith is to develop in this process. This is to bring us to see, little by little, the wonderful economy that has been set up, under which provision is made for this weak condition in us. It is an uncertain or undulating process and yet complete victory at the end. It is written for us that we might not lose heart. The experience of most of us is that one day we are bright and happy in our souls
{11}
and another day we are down, the next day we are a little brighter; and perhaps at a meeting we get a definite lift and realise marked victory over the flesh. We find definite provision to meet every exigency. It is very touching that they could hold up Moses¬ hands all day. As they weakened, Amalek prevailed. So long as the hands are supported, Amalek is defeated. It is a question of our state when faith is in exercise.
F.W. Joshua broke the power of Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. It is *Joshua* .
J.T. That is it. We must let Joshua into our minds. Who is Joshua? The Spirit of God gives us no account of him here, he appears abruptly. Later history explains fully who he is, but already light as to him is breaking in; one has come in marked by military ability.
Rem. Was not Joshua a man of another spirit?
J.T. Yes, that comes out later. We learn as we go on. There is authority in this. Joshua was not to be careless in his choice. Another thing here is "the book", verse 14; it is the beginning of spiritual history. The real difficulty is, that one knows in oneself that there is an unreadiness to get down to the real state of things, and to admit the weakness of soul in which we are. If we admit it we find Joshua acting for us, and Moses and Aaron and Hur acting for us, and everything done for us above. Let us therefore admit the weakness.
J.D. Would Aaron and Hur putting a stone under Moses be equivalent to an apprehension in our souls of the ability that is in Christ?
J.T. Yes. That is relatively a small thought, but it is what is needed for stability. It is not a rock, but a stone; the rock is smitten. According to @1 Corinthians 10:4, "the rock" followed them, not a stone. The stone refers to the smallness of our experience. It is enough for the moment; it met the need.
E.E. What is meant by verse 14? -- "Write this for a memorial in the book, and rehearse it in the ears of
{12}
Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens".
J.T. This experience is to be carried forward; it is that in which Saul failed. I have to remember what enters into my spiritual history; there is to be a blotting out of the remembrance of Amalek. It is not blotted out here. It was reserved to Saul to do that, but he did not do it. It is a question now of whether we are engaged on this line, blotting out the thing; whether in the culmination of the period of grace, and the building of the assembly in the service of God, there is the blotting out of Amalek. "I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens". It was the final test of king Saul, and he seemed to have done very well in his own eyes and in the eyes of others, but the word of God discovered to him that he had not done well; that he had not borne in mind this book of remembrance, and he lost the kingdom. So it is a question for each of us to settle: the memorial in "the book"; see also @Deuteronomy 25:17 - 19.
J.M. Is that because it is the commandment of the Lord?
J.T. That is right. Samuel, in conveying to Saul the divine commandment as to Amalek, said, "hearken to the voice of the *words* of Jehovah", @1 Samuel 15:1. That is not only a general instruction, but refers to the details of the matter. We get on to a certain point in our souls and think everything is well, but in truth it is not well. There are the *words* of Jehovah which Saul failed to keep, in the commission given to him to destroy the Amalekites. He reserved the *best* . There are good things in men -- family status, education, amiability, and such like; why not reserve a little of these? They will add to us outwardly, but if we do, we disregard the *words* of Jehovah as Saul did.
P.L. Is this the fundamental book in the divine library referring to the primary education of the saints, but carried forward right through their history?
{13}
J.T. That is it. A book involves accuracy and this is one of the most important items in the book of God. The very remembrance of Amalek is to be blotted out. How long we cherish in our minds a little bit of family status and the like! And yet we may be valuable brothers. "*The book*" is to determine things, and Saul is rejected because he disregarded it.
W.J.H. Would you say David and Mordecai had read this book carefully; David in ordering the destruction of the Amalekite that brought the crown and bracelet to him, and Mordecai in refusing to recognise the Agagite?
J.T. Very excellent allusions. It is a most testing and perhaps exposing experience. @Hebrews 4:12 says, "the word of God is living and operative, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and penetrating to the division of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. And there is not a creature unapparent before him; but all things are naked and laid bare to his eyes, with whom we have to do". And then @Proverbs 20:27 says, "Man's spirit is the lamp of Jehovah, searching all the inner parts of the belly". The inner conditions of the saints are tested in this way, and we discover motives that we never thought were there. If we let the word of God in, it will expose them to us, so that we might have the victory, and learn this book of spirituality. That is what it is, the beginning of the instruction. When God *records* things, they are worth recording, as building up spirituality in us.
H.D.T. Does the thought of rehearsing emphasise the need of ministry that covers this ground? We take too much for granted, perhaps.
J.T. I suppose the great prominence given to @Romans 7 in the early ministry of the revival last century would suggest this to us. It is very difficult to take into the mind the section of @Romans 7 which treats of this matter, and I think God intends it to be so in order to
{14}
make us look into it. He causes this truth to be rehearsed in our ears. Joshua would not miss the rehearsals. They would be the making of him, so that he should be an example for us.
Rem. We learn from verse 15 that "Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi". What would that suggest?
J.T. Moses coming in at the end is to bring out that, at this stage, it is still the authority of God that was seen in the smiting of Christ. It was His authority in the smiting of the river of Egypt, but now it is that authority in my soul, so that I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Moses is covering the whole position, but Joshua is coming into view. He has a place here, and he will be kept before us in this rehearsal by Moses. Moses is now in the lead; Joshua is subservient, yet presently we shall see that Moses disappears and Joshua is everything in leadership. The instruction is that young believers, and all of us, are to keep in mind the authority of God in Christ, and to recognise that according to @Romans 7, God is dealing, through this authority, with our inward parts. The apostle is putting it before us to look into it and to name our inward emotions, feelings, promptings, etc. -- *name* them; tabulate them, as it were. What do they mean? The law is spiritual; it is holy, it is just, it is good, but it has caused my death, sin through it becoming more powerful, @Romans 7:9 - 13. So that the Lord would have us to go through the thing, not in an optional way, but in a balanced analytical way. As I said, it is a difficult thing to keep in the mind that section of scripture. God intended it to be so, to make *men* of us as looking into it; by applying our minds to it. So that we reach the victory, attributing it all to God through Christ. Deliverance usually occasions a great and long exercise in the believer, but in result he sees that it is what Christ has effected for him, and therefore he thanks God, @Romans 7: 25.
{15}
G.G.McK. Does @Philippians 3:3 show us a man, the beloved apostle Paul, who was thoroughly in accord with what you have been speaking of; one who worshipped by the Spirit of God and had no confidence in the flesh?
J.T. That is the outcome of it. He says, "we are the circumcision, *who worship by the Spirit of God*, and boast in Christ Jesus, and do not trust in flesh (@Philippians 3:3)".
F.J.F. Would this be a great encouragement to Joshua, who had won this his first victory on a spiritual line? God showed him the end He had in view in blotting out the enemy?
J.T. Yes. It is in the book and to be rehearsed in his ears. It is of course written for us, so that we might have the thing rehearsed. In regard of what has been referred to -- the worship of God -- it is remarkable how the altar comes in here, how the worship of God is secured on this line. It is from Moses -- he was not directed to build it. It is his first one. We may worship because of teaching we receive into our minds, but this process of which we are now speaking is essential to the worship of God. It is remarkable how the woman of Samaria, when the Lord exposes her to herself, introduces the thought of worship; it comes into her heart then. The Lord does not despise it, but converses with her about it, and says things to her that He says to no one else. In that way we are reminded of the importance of humbly accepting the conditions we are in as in the flesh. Paul says, "when we were in the flesh",(@Romans 7:5) that is, these fleshy conditions that the believer has to discern and judge unsparingly, so as to be free to worship God. The two things go together; the disclosure of the woman's state, and the living water operating in that relation; it operates in the region of the lower affections. As our state, as in the flesh, is thus disclosed and judged, the Holy Spirit has scope to spring up into everlasting life. So that the man who is
{16}
supposed to come into the assembly at Corinth, and comes under the power of the prophetic ministry, does the same thing; he falls down and worships God. God comes into his soul and becomes his Object.
A.M.H. Is it that, as we go through this analysis and find how sinful things are in ourselves, we discover that the stone and the priestly feelings and purity are with us as being the subjects of the work of God; so that I myself with the mind serve God's law?
J.T. There are these possibilities in a believer. They are not in an unbeliever. He never arrives at them, no matter how much he may punish himself in a monastery -- as some do. He never arrives at spiritual results. The instruction is for a real believer, a person who has faith and in whom God has wrought.
H.J.M. The woman of Samaria read the rehearsal in "the book" in the presence of Christ. It is the only place to read the book and learn the lesson.
J.T. Quite so. She came into deliverance. Christ became the Object.
A.M.H. The name of the altar here is "Jehovah my banner".
J.T. Thus you go on now confidently to other conflicts and other victories.
H.D.T. "Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth", (@Psalm 60:4). Is that applicable now?
J.T. It is indeed. Here it is entirely from Moses -- "Jehovah my banner". Now we can go on again to other conflicts. We get a military start, and great confidence is inspired in the soul. We have reached a landmark under this banner. All conflict henceforth is to be under it.
{17}
SPIRITUALITY (2)
@Exodus 24:1 - 18; @Exodus 33:7 - 11
J.T. For the benefit of those who were not present this morning it may be remarked that our subject is spirituality; it is required, as was pointed out, in view of our eternal place and portion -- for we are to be raised in spiritual bodies, the final condition of believers -- and in view also of administration here. It was pointed out that "the spiritual discerns all things, and *he* is discerned of no one", (@1 Corinthians 2:15). Thus, although he has part in administrative matters, such as discipline, he is in accord with the mystery, that which is secretive, and maintains the character of the dispensation, for it is marked by the mystery, "in which", as it is said, "are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge", (@Colossians 2:3). Also in regard to restoration, it was pointed out that in @Galatians 6:1, the spiritual are enjoined to restore an erring one. It was said that in @John 3 we have the basic thought of spirituality, that is, in a constitutional sense, for "born of the Spirit" is a sovereign act of God, not through our intelligence or minds. God acts sovereignly by the Spirit, so that that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. There is that in us which is termed spirit, not in the sense of a person, but a quality. We read @Exodus 17 as introducing Joshua, the subject being spirituality as traced in his personal history, not necessarily in his book, but earlier. He appears in @Exodus 17 for the first time, without any introduction; and, in view of subsequent history, it is clear enough that we begin with him in the development of spiritual conditions, through our intelligence and exercises.
We have in that chapter an account of the battle with the Amalekites, pointing to Satan working through the
{18}
flesh in us. The battle records weakness, a variable condition until, through provision made, as needed, victory is assured. "Joshua broke the power of Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword", @Exodus 17:13, alluding to the word of God and its effect inwardly.
Moses is seen as dominant, representing, in the smiting of the rock, the authority of God. As interceding also he had the rod, for the authority of God was still there in the intercession. He also appointed Joshua to lead the army, and ultimately the victory was secured. Moses built an altar and called it "Jehovah-nissi", meaning. *The Lord is my banner*. Further victories will be secured under that banner -- spiritual victories.
The thought is to pursue the subject in relation to Joshua in @Exodus 24, ascension being in mind. Rephidim is evidently a lower plane, relating to ordinary, initial, spiritual experience, but chapter 24 contemplates ascension, so that our inquiry will be regarding that feature; and then in chapter 33, the house of God, where Joshua is seen as a young man, we are reminded that we are still in the early stages of spiritual development, marked by freshness and vigour; and he remained in the tent.
A.M.H. Would you say what Joshua represents - how we know Christ in a practical way in that relation, and then in the choosing of men?
J.T. I have taken him to mean, as I was mentioning this morning, Christ apprehended spiritually; the word spiritual, alluding to what is constitutional in the believer, perhaps indefinable, but over against what is natural in us, and even legitimate. Spirituality implies an indefinable feature, somewhat parallel with the idea of life, but more elevated, as connected with the spirit of a man. Joshua would therefore typify *Christ as you begin to apprehend Him as distinct from His authority, as seen in Moses, or even in His priesthood, but what He is as bringing within our range the great spiritual thoughts of*
{19}
*God: involving His realm, the eternal state of things*. We begin to discern it in a small way at first, as in @Exodus 17, for he is seen only in a military sense there. An element comes into the soul, indefinable even by the person himself, but yet it is there, and gives character and colour to the person henceforth, and you feel the power of it in him, especially as he takes part in the assembly. The subsequent history of Joshua throws light backwards; and we can look back, each in his own history, to the time when this began in his experience. Not that he did not have the Spirit before, nor partake of spiritual food, as we had this morning; but the circumstances, the smiting of the rock, and the attack on Amalek bring out this element in the believer's soul, so that he can even speak of the law, which taught him what sin is, as "spiritual", @Romans 7:14.
We have the upward movement in chapter 24, which is a continuation of the subject. It should be pointed out that this upward movement is the result of what intervened; namely, the introduction of the law and the covenant, and the abstract state needed for ascension as indicated in chapters 21,22 and 23, which contemplate experience in the land. In the light of those chapters -- which are included in the words read or spoken by Moses, and then written -- ascension, as in chapter 24, is possible. The teaching of chapters 21 to 23 is abstract and indicates what is suitable to the people *in the land*. Moses goes higher and Joshua goes with him, and it is thought that there is in Joshua, in the second half of the chapter, an element entering into our subject. He ascends with Moses and comes down with him, so that he had all the experience of the forty days above.
F.J.F. Does that represent Colossians to us?
J.T. I have no doubt it would. Colossians hardly takes us into the land, but it is the process of entering, and indicates what is suitable there. Our minds are set on things above where Christ sits at the right hand of
{20}
God. If our minds are there the features of heaven come into them.
H.W. What would be indicated in Joshua being Moses¬ attendant?
J.T. It is the thought before us, intimately allied with the mediatorship of Moses, which is still in mind, and is a leading thought all through Exodus. The time comes when he gradually disappears and Joshua alone remains in the leadership; this would allude to our progress. In these early chapters we have the thought of spirituality in a comparatively small way. It will be observed that Moses went up actually into the mountain. Jehovah says to him, "Come up to me into the mountain, and be there", @Exodus 24:12; that is a fixed place for the time, and then "Moses rose up, and Joshua his attendant; and Moses went up to the mountain of God". In the first verse, Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and the seventy elders are directed to "Go up to Jehovah". They were to "worship afar off", but "let Moses", we are told, "alone come near Jehovah". The company, that is Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and the seventy did not go up into the actual mountain. They went *up*, it is a question of *ascension in principle*. Moses alone, with Joshua, went up into the mountain; Moses *was there* .
W.H.U. What would be the import of the six days¬ silence? The glory covered the mount six days, but on the seventh day God spoke.
J.T. Formation would go on, I suppose, in the silence. An important matter in the service of God is to wait in silence. We have often remarked as to the presence of the Lord at the supper at Bethany, that the silence was only broken by Judas. There was a period of spirituality, and spirituality is required for silence in such circumstances. One can thus be silent in power.
E.S.W. Would you say a little more as to what is in your mind as to the difference between the elders going
{21}
up in principle, and Moses and Joshua going up in actuality?
J.T. It indicates assembly service at the present time. We do not go up in a literal or physical sense. Paul went up, whether in the body or out of it, he could not tell, he said; it might have been either. It was literal then, but now as in assembly service we do not go up save in a spiritual sense. Christ has gone up in a literal, corporeal sense, and *is there*, verse 12. Joshua, too, went up and came down with Moses. Hence I think the chapter is to promote spirituality, apprehended objectively in Christ gone up, but already known in the Joshua character. The chapters intervening, 17 to 23, fill out what is needed in the soul to learn what is in chapter 24. Moses going up definitely and being there and Joshua with him.
The number directed to go up would indicate Israel, or the people of God representatively. Moses had that in his mind when he "built an altar under the mountain, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel", verse 4; the saints as a whole are represented. They are to go up, but evidently not up to the mountain proper. They were to remain, as Moses says to the elders, "Wait here for us, until we return to you; and behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man have any matter, let him come before them", verse 14. That is, the ascension did not alter their literal position on earth. Ascension is typically a spiritual matter for us as in assembly. It does not alter our general position here below in the place of responsibility and testimony.
F.W.W. What is the import of these tables of stone and the law and the commandments given to Moses, in which, apparently, Joshua would have part?
J.T. Moses would ultimately come down with them, as specified here, "the tables of stone, and the law, and the commandment that I have written, for their instruction", verse 12. These items allude to what should
{22}
be brought down as governing the people of God in relation to the divine dwelling. They involve the principles governing us in the house of God. The dwelling is in mind in the next chapter, and Moses going up implies that he was to receive instruction for it. The tabernacle would be morally an impossibility without these, because the tabernacle is composed antitypically of the saints, and these elements are essential to its very constitution; that is, typically "the tables of stone, and the law, and the commandment that I have written". It might be thought that each item referred to the same thing, but not in the renewed mind, which observes fine distinctions; it is through our minds and affections that we are formed.
P.L. So that the law of the house in the prophet Ezekiel is attached to the top of the mountain?
J.T. Just so, "round about", You refer to @Ezekiel 43:12? The impression conveyed in the term tables of stone, is permanency in an antitypical sense. There is to be no variation at all in what is given. It cannot be added to, or subtracted from. It is written with the finger of God, as we are told later. Then the law refers to specified authority, not simply authority in a person, but what is specified, what we can act by; "To the law and the testimony!" (@Isaiah 8:20). We are told that if they do not speak according to this, "for them there is no daybreak (@Isaiah 8:20)". The law is a specified thing, as we had this morning, in the victory indicated in @Romans 7:25, "I myself with the mind serve God's law"; whatever that law may be; so that law, as specific, is of immense importance. There need be no doubt about it, it is specific. Then there is the commandment written for their instruction; the commandment is more personal to God. It is of peculiar force in the mind, and in the conscience. "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment", (@1 Corinthians 14:37). It is personal
{23}
and direct from the Lord. "I received from the Lord, that which I also delivered to you", (@1 Corinthians 11:23). That is for our instruction. All this came down as Moses came down, with Joshua. Moses had all these things with him, and the tabernacle, as we have it in chapter 33, called the "Tent of meeting", would be that in which they would be applicable; and Joshua was there; that is, the spiritual element is there, and does not depart from within the tent. So that God relies on the spiritual for the maintenance of these things. Like the prophetess Anna, who "departed not from the temple", (@Luke 2:37).
W.J.H. The apostle seems to bring in three of these things in the epistles to the Corinthians -- the "fleshy tables of the heart", @2 Corinthians 3:3; and "not without law to God", @1 Corinthians 9:21; and "the commandments of the Lord", @1 Corinthians 14:37.
J.T. You are thus maintained as in the house; not as those who are casual and stay in their own houses and worship at their own doors, @Exodus 33:10. They would not be concerned about what was *in* the tent. They worship because of a special display of glory, but in our chapter Joshua represents the spiritual, departing not from within the tent. That is the element that is needed for the preservation and maintenance of what is due to God in His house.
J.D. The impressions that Joshua would have as being with Moses on the mount would qualify him, as brought before us in chapter 33.
J.T. Yes. I think we might see the link between chapters 24 and 33, as to the ascension; our part being ascension in principle, Christ's part actual ascension. The Lord says, "go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God", (@John 20:17). That is truth in the soul, so that ascension properly precedes the establishment of the house here in testimony. It is a heavenly thing
{24}
on earth, and aside from the spiritual, which involves the knowledge of the heavenly, the house will not be preserved. We may be affected by the displays of glory from time to time, but the maintenance of the house requires that the spiritual element is there. It*is* there; the "young man departed not from within the tent". I think that the epistles to the Corinthians, for instance, indicate persons who are characteristically this; persons who are concerned about the state of things, and how far the people as a whole were getting away from the truth of the assembly. There were those who cared for it. They were *there*.
F.J.F. Would Simeon be one in whom that element is found? He was there to receive the Lord as He came in.
J.T. He is a good example. I was also thinking of Anna, but Simeon represents the intelligent side. He is introduced to us as "a man in Jerusalem",(@Luke 2:25) which is significant, because Jerusalem viewed spiritually means so much. Later the ass's colt is found in that spiritual environment. Bethphage, Bethany, the mount of Olives, and Jerusalem taken together form a group of spiritual suggestions in which the colt was held. The Lord is helping us now to keep the children in such an environment, for as held they are capable of spiritual thoughts. Jairus¬ daughter also is said to be raised up into a spiritual environment, as often noted. It is said of Simeon, that he was in Jerusalem "And he came in the Spirit into the temple"(@Luke 2:27); he was there, and took the Babe in his arms. I believe that is how Luke would help us in this matter of spirituality, that in principle we do not leave the house. Simeon and Anna together exemplify this thought.
C.D. Joshua as going up with Moses would become acquainted with the pattern of the house, all the holy detail of it, as given to Moses.
J.T. That is what I thought. The literal ascension is
{25}
attached to the mediatorship of Christ. Our attention has been called to the silence of six days; then Jehovah speaking, as indicative of what went on above. What did Joshua see? What did he hear? We are told what Nadab and Abihu, and Aaron and the elders saw. They saw the God of Israel, and what was under His feet. That was impressive, and would promote spiritual feelings. But what did Joshua see? Moses was there forty days and forty nights, and Joshua with him. So that it seems as if Colossians would help, as has been remarked, setting our minds on things above, in a meditative way, the Holy Spirit in us enabling us to grasp what is there. The Lord says, "the Son of man is in heaven", (@John 3:13); a great spiritual thought in John's gospel. "If then ye see the Son of man ascending up where he was before", John 6:62. In these references in the gospels we see the heavenly side of our position. Peter says to the Lord, "thou art the holy one of God", (@John 6:69); he gathered up that in his soul, from what he saw and heard, especially as in that chapter.
E.B.McC. Do we see in that the sisterly element; they learn in silence, and thus the subjective state is formed?
J.T. I think it is just in that way that our sisters come into the thought of spirituality. Taking Anna and Simeon together you have the intelligence in the man, and the subjective devotedness in the woman, coming in at the same moment. That is, Anna linked herself on with what Simeon was saying, and she praised God -- the brother first and then the sister, -- denoting spirituality. How could they join in with such intelligence and holy feeling, marked as "in Jerusalem", aside from spirituality? "In Jerusalem" here is a characteristic thought.
H.D.T. Is there some point in Joshua not being named in the earlier part of the chapter?
J.T. I think so. Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and the seventy elders are named, but Joshua has a
{26}
small place in the chapter; yet in the matter before us he had a place beyond anyone else except Moses. It is still a small feature of our subject, but it is there. What we have been saying is of the utmost importance: what did he see up there?
H.J.M. Does it suggest the thought of our ascension in the service of God, with the Lord gradually getting a greater place in our hearts?
J.T. And it involves the mind, as we have been saying -- the ability of the believer to place his mind on things above. @Romans 7 shows that the believer is in control of his mind; chapter 12 shows that the mind is to be renewed. Colossians says that we are to set it on things above. The Holy Spirit enables us to grasp what is there, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God -- *where* He is. We apprehend Him there in His mediatorial character, but we apprehend also the spiritual element which abides, and that is Joshua.
H.D.T. So that it is a hidden matter at the moment. It is going to work out in its results later.
J.T. I think it is a hidden matter generally, even in our meetings, but it gives character to those in whom it exists. It shows itself in their attitude, in their manner, and in the part they are able to take in the assembly; it is felt, and normally all who are present gain by it. It lifts the service of God out of the realm of the natural mind.
J.D. Would there be any analogy between what is set forth here in Joshua and Moses, and Paul being caught up into the third heaven and hearing unutterable things?
J.T. Paul said he could not tell whether he was in the body or out of it, but it must have added much to his spirituality. He did not speak of it for fourteen years, but I am certain that after he came down and was adjusted, increased spirituality would be seen in him. In his ministry Paul stresses spirituality.
{27}
H.J.M. The great mediator was the exclusive object of attachment for Joshua. Typically, he was greater than the mountain, and greater than all that was given, and greater than the people.
J.T. The mind is to follow the Mediator. "Moses went up to the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain. And the glory of Jehovah abode on mount Sinai". "And Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights". The mind is the great medium of all that is connected with intelligence. The soul, of course, is the seat of the affections and feelings which are to be governed, but it is the mind which is presented here. "I ascend", says the Lord, "to my Father and your Father(@John 20:17)". The mind takes that in and is affected.
C.F.F. Is there a connection between this and the mount of transfiguration?
J.T. There is a relation between them. The mount of transfiguration was to establish special conditions in the persons that were taken up -- in the three witnesses. They had a special place in the testimony. It involved peculiar spiritual wealth in those three men. Of the three, Peter alone speaks of it. They saw the heavenly side of the Lord's position. The Lord told them not to speak about it until He rose from the dead. It belonged to the new, heavenly order of things. As already said, none of them speaks of it in ministry except Peter; and as about to put off his tabernacle he does so with such words and such feelings as to show that it had been in his soul all the time, maturing and being added to.
A.E.M. Would you say that abstraction is an essential feature in spirituality in the service of God, and does that come from learning the control of the mind?
J.T. I am thankful you mention that. One has thought of it a good deal lately. John helps us greatly on the line of abstraction. As one has control of one's mind, governed by the truth, the Spirit supports one. The mind of the believer is renewed. He can thus eliminate
{28}
from it, and shut out what is not needed at any particular time; so that Paul saying, "whether we are beside ourselves, it is to God",(@2 Corinthians 5:13) would mean that his mind and his affections were fully on God. He was able by the Spirit to exclude all else for the moment, he would be in ecstasy, as Peter was. As we thus have control of our minds, we learn as in assembly to shut out all else, and even in an individual way at times; the Spirit then gives you a view of heavenly things. I believe that is a most important thing for us at the present time.
E.E.S.L. Does the capacity to make the progress indicated in Joshua have its beginning in the Holy Spirit sustaining the spirit of our minds?
J.T. Exactly. What we have been saying about @Romans 7 enters in too, it is the control of one's mind. I believe in most cases the mind largely controls the person; deliverance, in principle, gives you control of your mind, so that you can make resolves, and you can retire to be with God, to set your mind on things above, and the Holy Spirit is with you in that. In fact, it is only by the Spirit that we can be maintained in it, and I think the chapters alluded to. @Exodus 21, 22 and 23, imply the abstract state in which we may be with God. I am entitled to take account of myself in an abstract way, and the Spirit sustains me in it, and God takes account of me in that way, too. I believe we are to follow Moses -- the going up of Christ. His present position on high, and what He is as Man: what His condition is there. We are to be able to take in all these things; and as thus held in the mind, by the power of the Spirit they will be formative.
E.E.S.L. We need not be afraid of being presumptuous in accepting definitely the great principle of self-control.
J.T. Quite so. Then as to spirituality, in one like Paul coming down from the third heaven, there would
{29}
be much added in the house of God here below; not only what we have had, the tables of stone and the law and the commandments, but spirituality abiding in the house permanently. It is thus that the house of God is maintained here.
W.J.H. I suppose the seventy would have one judgment, one thought, of what was above when they came down, but Joshua would have something very much greater, as having been further up, having gone the whole way with Moses.
J.T. Think of the scene presented: it is *glory*! Glory is an immense thought. We are told that "the appearance of the glory of Jehovah was like a consuming fire on the top of the mountain, before the eyes of the children of Israel. And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and ascended the mountain. And Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights", verses 17,18. Think of all that was *inside*, as it were, beyond what Israel saw! Their minds would follow Moses going in, but then there was the unfolding of the pattern. What was that pattern? It was Christ. For forty days God was bringing out and unfolding the pattern of what was in His mind. Think of the glory involved in that! Joshua represented the spiritual side there. What an enlargement in him there would be during the forty days! And so it is that the Spirit enables us to grasp heavenly things as presented. We are entitled to look in there. Stephen looked in. He saw the heavens opened and he tells what he saw. Hebrews has been called the book of the opened heavens. This is what is opened up to us, and then there is liberty and power given to look into heaven. Entering the holiest corresponds: the believer has access there -- power to look in and see what is there.
C.C.E. Speaking practically, we do not give ourselves time for a consideration of these things. The hurry of modern life is not conducive to spirituality.
{30}
J.T. That is an important item. Time is one of the scarcest things that most of us have, but still that difficulty has to be overcome. John says, "and we have contemplated his glory, *a glory* as of an only-begotten *with a father*"@John 1:14 -- that requires withdrawal from ordinary things, and the fixing of our view on Christ with the Father, what He was with the Father. As confirmatory of what you say, one would call attention to what finishes this matter of communications on the mountain. In this connection we might refer to @Exodus 31: 13 - 17. You do not get earlier what is stated there. God *is bringing it in there for the purpose of impressing us with the necessity of taking time for divine things*  -- not for service, *but for contemplation* . What we need is that in the power of the Spirit we should absorb what revelation affords for us. That passage is the finish of the instruction on the mountain, and shows what God had in mind in view of His house; *that His people should be restful spiritually and take time to contemplate divine things*.
A.E.D. Would you link that with the mount of Olives as coming in continuously in the Lord's service? Would that be a spiritual realm into which the Lord was able to retire?
J.T. Yes, indeed! "By night, going out, he remained abroad on the mountain called the mount of Olives", (@Luke 21:37). What was He doing there? What communion, what enjoyment. He had with the Father in that out of the world state of things!
F.J.F. Is there a suggestion of the wondrous pathway of the Lord, in the pavement of sapphire, as the body of heaven for clearness?
J.T. I suppose it is to be reflected in us, the footnote gives, "the transparency of sapphire". It is a question of transparency. How clear all is under God, under His holy feet, as seen in Christ! He would have us in that transparency of walk. It involves the tabernacle
{31}
period. He "went about in a tent and in a tabernacle (@2 Samuel 7:6)". One can understand the holiness of the tabernacle, even the floor of it. The dust of the floor of it was to be used to bring to light something done in a hidden way, in the way of evil. @Numbers 5. It would be exposed. God was reflected here in the footsteps of Jesus. What transparency there was! everything would become exposed through Him. He said, I am "altogether that which I also say to you (@John 8:25)". That is to be reflected in the believer. He is to be altogether what he says, there are no dark parts.
H.H. What is meant by "under his feet"?
J.T. I think it must include the dust on the floor of the tabernacle. Death was known there, as nowhere else, but there was the exposure and judgment of hidden evil; for this, the dust had to be put into holy water in an earthen vessel.
H.H. With regard to the ascension, do you think it comes within the range of the assembly as made up of spiritual persons?
J.T. I think the assembly is maintained here on that principle. It is what comes out of heaven really. We all know what happened in Peter's trance. He was in an ecstasy, withdrawn from ordinary affairs, and what came to him was a sheet knit at the four corners, let down from heaven. The house of God required that, it was a heavenly matter. Peter was to be brought into this side of the truth; his labours had been in relation to the Jews, but he was to be brought into the heavenly side of the position, and God used extraordinary means to effect this. As we saw here on Lord's day, he fulfilled his obligations in the dignity of a son. Although he did not preach sonship as far as we know, he was a son characteristically. In his trance God brought him into the heavenly side of the truth and he moved in the power of it in the service to be rendered, in bringing in the Gentiles, and brought them in at the highest
{32}
point. The Holy Spirit fell upon them while he was speaking. That would impress him.
F.W. The bringing in of the Gentiles was a great contribution to the house of God.
J.T. He did not bring them in as a Jewish apostle, but as a man, caught up to heaven, as it were, and let down. He was qualified to do it by the special service of God, so that the Gentiles were brought in at the highest point, not by way of what was established at Jerusalem, but by what was in heaven. @Acts 10 is a highly spiritual chapter.
Ques. What is the thought of eating and drinking on the mountain?
J.T. It is that you are happy and free in *nearness* to God. They are called "nobles" at that point. It refers to our dignity; that we are suitable and equal to the exalted position we are in. I thought we ought not to omit this point about Peter, as to spirituality -- how the house of God is constituted. The Gentiles are brought in by Peter; he was qualified to bring them in, not as a Jewish apostle, but as a man with the keys of the kingdom of heaven. He uses the keys in a dignified way, as qualified to use them by the vision, the result of what he obtained by his abstraction on the house-top. He was spiritual enough to be in an ecstasy, and, as in it, heaven instructed him so that his service is highly spiritual. I believe that to be a feature; not only what we say, but the spiritual touch we give to it in our service.
J.D. In regard to the dust of the tabernacle being mingled with the holy water, how does that work now in bringing evil to light in a soul?
J.T. The Lord does it typically in the priest, so that hidden evil is brought to light; it is in the presence of this element of transparency. The dust of the tabernacle was peculiar. Death was known there, not death in the ordinary sense, but death was known before God.
{33}
There was no floor in the tabernacle, just the wilderness. The dust of it was to be used for this exposure in connection with holy water. The transaction in @Numbers 5 is very peculiar. It stands in relation to evil being put out of the camp. The leper and the like can be easily discerned, but unfaithfulness to Christ is not always so easily discerned. There may be unfaithfulness and yet the outward relation seemingly intact. That is the point; the evil is disclosed by the dust of the tabernacle being put into the holy water. The woman is made to drink it. @Numbers 5:26.
E.S.W. Does the dust applied in that way show how the individual reacts to this testing application of death? Faithful persons would also react to the test, as that dust was applied.
J.T. Yes, there is fruitfulness as we react in transparency to it; we can face it. "He that doeth truth cometh to the light (@John 3:21)". I think the truth as to Joshua so far is clear enough. He is to show that, what is to be in the house, as we may say permanently, is this element of spirituality in a young man. It is an early stage in @Exodus 33:11, but we shall get it in a fuller way later.
P.L. Do we have the two thoughts brought together in Timothy 3? The young man is to learn how to behave in the house of God, and immediately following is the reference to the mystery of piety, involving the incarnation and Christ being "received up in glory(@1 Timothy 3:16)".
J.T. It is a question of behaviour in the house, "the assembly of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth. And confessedly the mystery of piety is great. God has been manifested in flesh, has been justified in the Spirit, has appeared to angels, has been preached among the nations, has been believed on in the world, has been received up in glory", (@1 Timothy 3:16). All that is cherished in those who are spiritual. There is a great need of this in all gatherings of the saints -- the spiritual
{34}
who would stand up in all circumstances to maintain what is due to God.
F.W. Moses "returned to the camp; but his attendant, Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, departed not from within the tent". What is the difference between the action of Moses and the action of Joshua?
J.T. The action of Joshua implies the spiritual side at the present time; the passage really contemplates the present time. Failure having come in, Joshua maintains the permanency of the house in character; and Moses would typify Christ in His personal official right returning to the camp, which would mean that He walks amidst the golden candlesticks. He visits the gatherings, and in principle the whole of Christendom. He has the right to move about, but our part is to stand by the house. Joshua is the son of Nun, which name is said to embody the idea of sprouting, suggesting life; that which is to be perpetuated.
H.D.T. He is described in both passages as Moses¬ attendant.
J.T. That emphasises what we have been saying. We are still in the initial phases of the subject of spirituality. He is called in his own book the attendant of Moses, but here being a young man he represents the development of the subject of spirituality, leading to its full maturity. He "departed not from within the tent", as a young man.
H.H. That would apply to the present time. The exercises of spiritual men over against the breakdown in Christendom.
J.T. The truth and character of the house is preserved in those who are spiritual. Not simply *what brethren hold*, as we may say; it is the spiritual element that is to give character to it, because the house of God is a heavenly institution; it has, in a sense, come down from heaven.
R.S. It must be maintained in a spiritual way. I was thinking of the young men in @Acts 5.
{35}
J.T. Those that buried Ananias? Just so, they are ready to do that, to look after the saints, even though they may be erring ones.
D.H. If spirituality is maintained among the people of God, cannot we expect God to move and speak to them, as we see here? Jehovah, the passage says, "spoke with Moses face to face, as a man speaks with his friend", @Exodus 33:11.
J.T. Quite so. We can see the importance of the house of God, and the need that it should be preserved spiritually. The great privileges that are attached to it are seen here in Jehovah coming down and speaking with Moses; what privilege is involved! How well worth while to be spiritual, even from this point of view alone, so as to preserve the truth of the house!
E.B.McC. Moses would set forth one developed in spirituality?
J.T. No doubt. He goes up again without Joshua, for the matter of spirituality is not stressed after this chapter. It is Moses without Joshua in the next chapter, because another thing is in mind, the renewal of the covenant -- figurative of the new covenant.
E.B.McC. Pitching the tent outside the camp shows that Moses knew what to do.
J.T. Quite so. And Joshua, in departing not from within the tent, is fully in keeping with the spiritual intelligence of the mediator.

SPIRITUALITY (3)
@Numbers 13:16 - 25; @Numbers 14:6 - 10,21 - 24
J.T. At our last reading we dwelt on @Exodus 24, in which we considered the matter of ascension, Joshua appearing there as Moses¬ attendant and going up with him into the mount. That is, *spirituality is represented in him there in relation to ascension*. Moses represents the mediatorship of Christ, and Joshua the spiritual element which we are to observe *objectively* -- as we do, it lays hold of us, so that we are able to ascend. Then there is the descent from the mount, Joshua coming down with Moses, carrying forward the thought before us, having been with him as receiving the pattern of the tabernacle, and the instructions relative to it.
In @Exodus 33 Joshua is seen as not departing from the tabernacle. He is now called "Joshua the son of Nun (@Exodus 33:11)". The meaning of his father's name is said to be "continuing", or "perpetuating", an important thought added here, for it is a question of continuance. He continued; he departed not from the tent. I suppose the idea of continuance would be passed on to Joshua constitutionally so that the spiritual element is characteristically always in the house; if it be not there, then as the Lord says, "your house is left unto you", (@Luke 13:35). Spirituality must be permanently in it, if the house is to continue. So that the apostle says in @Hebrews 3:6 "whose house are *we*, if we hold fast the boldness and the boast of hope firm to the end".
Our subject now leads to the inheritance. The two readings today should include the inheritance, and the essential need of spirituality in order that we should possess it. Unspirituality is disclosed in these chapters in Numbers and is enlarged upon in Hebrews. It implies exclusion from the inheritance; for it is really
{37}
unbelief. What may be pointed out first of all in chapter 13 is the change of Joshua's name. It is a very significant matter. In verse 16, after the names of those sent to search the land are given, Moses calls Hoshea, which means *deliverance*,  Jehoshua, which means *Jehovah is Saviour*. We have thus a great advance in Joshua, which is to be borne in mind in all that we have to say henceforth: the change of name indicating a great increase in his personality. It is not referring to any increase in Christ's personality, but in our apprehension of Him. It is this new name that is used to designate Joshua in Exodus; although given later, it would be used by Moses in writing the book; but it is at this juncture that the name is changed, so that henceforth he is more in our eyes as typical of Christ, and here Caleb is introduced as representing ourselves; those who are benefiting by what is presented objectively so far. It is Caleb that is said to inherit -- Caleb and his seed. One would suggest that we take particular notice of the introduction of Caleb, in order to understand how we should progress from this point -- he is a man of *another spirit*. This is not said off Joshua, because what is said of him is that he is "a man in whom is the Spirit", (@Numbers 28:18). That is more Christ Himself. *Another* spirit is what should characterise those who are acquiring spirituality.
A.B.J. Would you enlarge a little on the change of Joshua's name?
J.T. It would, I think, point to some fresh feature of the Person of Christ coming into evidence at this juncture. We of course speak of Him from what we read in scripture, but it has to be remembered that the mind of God unfolded itself in persons, and then the Scripture was written. *The thing exists before we have the Scripture recording it or the doctrine governing it*. So that all instruction that we have, before there was any writing of the Pentateuch, would mean that progress in
{38}
the knowledge of God was seen first in testimony in persons. It would be seen in the progress of *persons moving in it*, not in writings yet; and in truth it should be so with each of us, that our testimony is according to our measure, not simply according to what one reads, but according to one's measure. We must read, of course, and have doctrine, but our true testimony is according to our measure.
J.D. Would John's gospel amplify what you are saying as to the thing existing. Of Andrew it is said: "He first finds his own brother Simon, and says to him. We have found the Messias (which being interpreted is Christ). And he led him to Jesus. Jesus looking at him said. *Thou* art Simon, the son of Jonas; *thou* shalt be called Cephas (which interpreted is stone)", (@John 1: 41,42); J.N.D.¬s foot-note says *"looking carefully"*  -- the thing existed. Is that the idea?
J.T. Quite so, it existed potentially in Peter. It was a question of his name: "thou shalt be called Cephas"; but in Matthew it is: *"thou art*". That supports fully what you say, that the thing did exist. It is what exists that is named. Following out the thought in Joshua, the time had come for an increased presentation of Christ typically to our minds; for spirituality must keep pace with knowledge, "we all have knowledge", the apostle says. That is objective knowledge, but conscious knowledge is another matter, and that is much the same as that which existed before the holy writings. Conscious knowledge in a person who is the subject of God's work would be the measure of the testimony of that person up to any particular time.
E.S.W. In the development of spirituality with us, does this mean that Christ becomes more personal to us? The change is from *Deliverance* to "*Jehovah is Saviour"*, indicating that instead of being occupied with what the Lord has done for us, we now find something more in Him personally.
{39}
J.T. That is good. Deliverance is an experience, but the person called Jehoshua, Jehovah is Saviour, is in the antitype an Object of worship. Christ becomes an Object to us. It is a point reached in our histories, when He is known in that way. So that the Lord says to the man whose eyes had been opened, @John 9:35, "Thou, dost thou believe on the Son of God?" It is a question of the man's state, whether he is equal to it, and he says. "And who is he. Lord, that I may believe on him?"(@John 9:36) and the Lord says,(@John 9:37) "Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is *he*". Evidently he had seen Him and not known Him as the Son of God, but now the fact is disclosed to him as a matter of faith in his soul. Hence he says, "I believe. Lord: and he did him homage", verse 38. He worshipped Him, no longer simply as the One who opened his eyes, but as the Son of God.
E.E.S.L. Is this something like Simeon's statement, "mine eyes have seen thy salvation"(@Luke 2:30)? It was not the thing in the abstract, but he had seen the Lord.
J.T. Yes, he came in by the Spirit. He is speaking by the power of the Spirit of God, showing that what we are in growth becomes consolidated in our minds. The mind takes in what corresponds with our experience and we are consolidated so far, hence the blind man had reached a point in his history that would remain. He was a worshipper of the Son of God.
H.J.M. Would Zacchaeus fit in here? He wanted to see Jesus, who He was, and Jesus Himself entered his house, so that Zacchaeus might get a right view of Him.
J.T. Quite so. He wanted to see Him, who He was. He had that desire in his soul, but he must get into position in order to see Him; looking down from the sycamore tree on Jesus would not do. The Lord entered into his house, and thus he would get a right view of
{40}
Him. Exodus gives the house, the dwelling-place of the spiritual; Joshua not departing from it. He is essential to it; that is, spirituality, in whomsoever it may be, must be *there* . Concurrent with this, the Lord, as seen in Moses returning to the camp, has liberty to act in His authority throughout *the profession;* but for the *house*, spirituality must be there. Numbers is a concurrent thought. It is not the house, but the *inheritance* that is in mind, and Christ acquiring an increased place in our souls, so that Caleb immediately comes into view. We have a testimony now, not only in Christ personally, but also in the formation in a saint, Caleb, who is henceforth representative of appreciation of the inheritance.
E.S.W. Is Joshua seen here as acquiring dignity and personality? These men in @Numbers 13:1 - 16 are all described as princes and heads, but Joshua is more distinguished.
J.T. Joshua, by Moses¬ action in changing his name, is put above all. We are on new ground really, only the section before us enlarges on the sin of the ten spies and the whole people. Such a one as this is now in their midst and bearing testimony, and with him the great formation seen in Caleb. Caleb is, comparatively speaking, made prominent in these two chapters -- a man with another spirit. A spiritual man will not have the spirit of the world. He renounces it. It is not the Spirit of God here, it is *another* spirit -- in the sense of being different, as of God, from the spirits of men generally.
P.L. Would you say that the beginning of the Colossian epistle, enlarging on the glories of Christ, would attach to the thought of this change of name; while in the personnel at the end of the epistle have we, in such as Tychicus, Onesimus, and Epaphras, the lovers of the inheritance as Caleb was?
J.T. I think so. As we proceed we shall see this
{41}
feature in the chapter relating to the daughters of Zelophehad, and here indeed, as you will observe, it is said in chapter 14:24: "my servant Caleb, because he hath another spirit in him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he came; and his seed shall possess it". We shall see later how his seed comes into evidence, so that we have a great spiritual lead in another than Christ here. The truth is taken on in such proportions that it is given a lead, as it were, by itself, in persons who are not typical of Christ, but typical of spirituality; and they have a seed, who are the ones to inherit. Rahab received the spies and sent them out "another way". The word *another* is a good one in these matters. One may take on things intellectually and speak of them well, but we must look for *another spirit*, and *another way*.
S.E.E. Do you distinguish between the spirit that Caleb acquired typically and the Holy Spirit? Would "another spirit" be similar to the expression in @Ephesians 4:23 -- "being renewed in the spirit of your mind"?
J.T. It does not allude to Caleb's own spirit which he received from God and which every man has. It refers to what he was characteristically in his spirit. If we say, A man has a good spirit, that does not mean simply that he has a spirit, but conveys what is characteristic of him.
F.I. Does it come about with us, as we are under the hand of the Spirit of God, and have the Lord before us as our Object?
J.T. It must come in that way. The Spirit is contemplated as present, as you will remember, in @Exodus 17, our subject necessitating the Spirit given. So that the change in the believer referred to here is by the Spirit, but through exercises that we have already noted. We get the expression for the first time of "another spirit". We get Caleb here for the first time, and then this expression.
{42}
H.D.T. Spirituality in ourselves is not exactly to be our object, but it comes about as having Christ as our Object?
J.T. That is right. So that Christ is exalted here. Joshua typically is enlarged, referring to the estimation the saints have of Christ. The Lord was acting as the Son of God when He put the mud on the man's eyes and opened them, but the man evidently was not ready, for he said, "A man called Jesus" did it, (@John 9:11). It was when the Lord heard that they had cast him out, that He found him, and introduced the subject of His sonship, then the man comes into it; showing that we progress in stages, the Lord watching the development of our souls and bringing in the truth needed as we proceed.
C.S.S. Would you say that worship flows from what divine Persons are to us, more than what they have done or are doing for us?
J.T. That is right. Though the man in @John 9 had seen Christ before, there is no word about worship until the Lord makes Himself known to him, and he says, "Lord, I believe". He is now capable of believing such a great truth.
E.E. In connection with a right spirit, John refers to that which they had heard, seen, and handled, @1 John 1:1. When with the Lord here on earth John spoke in such a way that he showed he was not moved by a right spirit; he would have called fire down from heaven. We need to be in company with, and contemplate the Lord to derive a right spirit.
J.T. Yes. John, I suppose, represents faith in steady attachment to Christ. John regarded himself as the disciple whom Jesus loved. He puts the matter as to who he was on to the Lord. If Jesus loved him, he must have been *lovable*. He loves us all, but the Lord loved him especially. How did he become lovable? By taking on the features of Christ. David is the beloved, his
{43}
name means that, as typical of Christ. The announcement from heaven is "This is my beloved Son,(@Matthew 17:5)" and we are taken into favour in the Beloved. We become beloved, lovable, by taking on the features of Christ. One does not wish to be loved any more among the brethren, than he is loved in heaven, and heaven would love him according to the measure of his taking on the features of Christ. It is simply an extension of what is in Christ. The word from heaven to Him was not "*all* my delight", but "in whom I have found my delight,(@Matthew 17:5)". God has found His delight in Christ, but, by extension in the saints as well.
Rem. Had not Caleb a spirit of faith developed in the company of Joshua?
J.T. In the type, that is what is in mind; thus Joshua having already acquired distinction with God, it was the privilege of all the spies to know him in this way. It was not a secret matter, but ten of them apparently acquired no gain at all. They must have had remarkable times in caves and other secret places as entering the land, going all the way north to Hamath, and down again to Hebron. What holy conversation they could have had, but evidently they did not profit by it, except Caleb, and hence he comes in just here. It is in searching the land, typically in the opening up of the mind of God as to the inheritance, that Caleb comes into evidence. He must have learned from Joshua, and there is a great deal in that, because, in the revival God has been opening up the territory for us and has used men to do it. Those who are the companions of such men have a great advantage, but how many of them have been marked by spirituality? The most prominent leaders in Mr. Darby's time, and those associated with him, became the leaders in divisions six or eight years after he died, showing that spirituality in those with whom we are in association may not help us at all. We must have the root of it *in us*.
{44}
L.F. Moses goes to great pains in chapter 13:17 - 20 to indicate to them in detail what they were to examine.
J.T. Yes. The Scripture says "Go up this way by the south and go up into the hill-country, and ye shall see the land, what it is; and the people that dwell in it, whether they are strong or weak, few or many; and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds; and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether there are trees in it or not". We are told that "they went up, and searched out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, where one comes towards Hamath. And they went up by the south, and came to Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak were there. Now Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt". Then it goes on in verse 24: "That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the grapes which the children of Israel had cut down there, and they returned from searching out the land after forty days". We are told in verse 20, that it was the time of the first grapes. Moses says, "take courage, and bring of the fruit of the land". So that typically the description refers to our own times, the period of Christianity. Israel, of course, will be in the land in a literal sense, but ours is the time of the first grapes. These twelve men entered it at its best. We have to do with it at its best -- our inheritance is heaven's best.
A.E.M. With these ten men, is there some weakness carried forward from their earlier history, or is it that at any time in the development of the truth we may drop out through not taking advantage of the help available at that particular time?
J.T. It seems that we have to consider Caleb well at this stage. We referred to the times they must have had in the long journeying, and evidently Caleb was a learner all the time. One can understand that he and
{45}
Joshua would have peculiar seasons of communion. I believe that the point is *two*, at this particular time, representing full testimony to appreciation of the inheritance, whereas ten are against it. Joshua and Caleb here have the character of a remnant, and suffering is marking it. If any man will live godly in Christ Jesus, he will suffer persecution. You can always find it in that way. The history of the people seen in the ten, and in the whole of the people coming under their influence, would indicate that the people generally were not developing spiritually at all. Caleb, I believe, represents here one who had an unnamed and unrecorded history, like others in scripture, but his history qualified him for the great truth, seen at this particular time. That is, there must be secret history to develop such a man as Caleb. Already he has another spirit; surely he must have been advancing secretly.
E.E.S.L. Would Caleb exemplify the immense value of being able to discern and follow spiritual leadership, while the ten and Israel who followed them might warn us of the terrible danger of contesting the ground when spiritual leadership is available to us? - instead of accepting it we refuse it.
J.T. I fully agree with that. He is outstanding as profiting by the experience in this search with Joshua; whereas the ten do not gain, and so it is in any movement implying a search. It is a question of search here, and the great thought of search is in the Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, we are told, even the depths of God, but then that must imply operations in the saints. The search is to carry us with it, and in this instance only Caleb was affected, and that is what is stressed in Hebrews, that the most fell in the wilderness. They did not profit by the example set before them; Caleb did. So it is in any movement of God where a divine search is going on, and spiritual things come
{46}
out through the search. Only a few get the inner thought, because they are spiritual; the mass do not. They may go on for a while, as indeed is the case in the revival in which we are sharing now, the greater number went off from the truth; spirituality was not developed, although the opportunity was there.
H.D.T. Is the matter all the more serious because all the twelve men are described as princes, as though they were leading men, but the ten were leaders away from the truth?
J.T. That is so. It shows the danger, as I was remarking, as seen in the history of the last century; how many leading men took part in the falling away in the division of 1890, and more particularly in 1908. It was the princes, "men of renown", who took issue with the truth.
P.L. In regard to searching out it says, "the glory of kings is to search out a thing", (@Proverbs 25:2).
J.T. That is what came out in Christ. "It is the glory of God to conceal a thing; but the glory of kings is to search out a thing, (@Proverbs 25:2)" and I believe that enters into the administration given into the hands of Christ. Things are searched out, and Paul says it is by the Spirit. Paul was available to the Spirit, and did not say everything he knew to the Corinthians. He moved with the Spirit, and the Spirit was ready to search out everything for them, but they were not ready for this, and that corresponds with what we have been saying.
J.D. Would you say that the sin of the ten is more pronounced by the fact that when the people spoke of stoning Caleb and Joshua, the glory of God appeared in the tent of meeting? That would come in the defence of what God had in the two.
J.T. That is how God comes in. In crises God shows Himself in some way. Here it is said, "the glory of Jehovah appeared in the tent of meeting to *all* the children of Israel", (@Numbers 14:10). That settles the
{47}
matter -- the presence of God with those who are right.
As regards this search, these ten men had part in it but gained nothing by it, on the contrary they opposed the two spiritual men. In the search, there are great thoughts suggested, especially in regard to Hebron, to show us how far back the matter reached; it is what God ordained before the world for our glory. Colossians goes that far back, but Ephesians goes further back, Ephesians is the greatest search of all.
F.W. Would it be right to say that the whole situation for the testimony was really preserved through the spirituality of Caleb?
J.T. That is the point, I think.
J.D.U. Is that not because Caleb followed Jehovah? It is in reference to that, that he is spoken of as having another spirit. Jehovah speaks of the others as despising Him. Does that mean that they had not laid hold of the fact of the change of name, "Jehovah is Saviour" and, therefore, his ability to lead the people into the inheritance.
J.T. Yes. Caleb, in chapter 14:24, is called, "my servant Caleb". According to what he says in Joshua, the land that he had trodden was to be his and his children's, @Joshua 14:9. Moses sware to him, so I think he is the saving element subjectively. It is a question of spirituality in the saints. Christ is in heaven, Joshua -- "Jehovah is Saviour" -- is an objective thought now. The subjective side is in Caleb. He is really more stressed in that sense than Joshua, because it is a question now of the saints holding the ground, and that is what Hebrews takes up, the question of faith."W which have believed", says the writer, "do enter into rest (@Hebrews 4:3)". It is characteristic of us who believe, that we enter in.
A.B.J. Would not Caleb have in his heart something of the purpose of God as indicated in Moses¬ song on the wilderness side of the Red Sea?
{48}
J.T. No doubt; he came out of Egypt. He would have part in that song, and it would be light in his soul that God would bring them into the land of His inheritance. He and Joshua are the link here with entrance into the inheritance. A very remarkable thing, two men out of two million people maybe - six hundred thousand men -- two men forming the link between the exodus from Egypt and the inheritance which God provided. It is a question, not only of what I know, but of what I am spiritually -- a man of another spirit. So that the unbelievers all fall in the wilderness; only the little ones go in. These two men represent formation, and the little ones represent a generation, another generation; but the idea in mind is in these two men, hence the importance of spirituality.
C.S.S. Peter speaks of seeking out and searching out with regard to the glories of Christ. Is that the line we are on?
J.T. It is. The thought here is *searching*. The word by Moses to the children of Israel in chapter 13:2 was, "Send thou men, that they may search out the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel. Ye shall send a man of every tribe of his fathers, each a prince among them". There is full opportunity for all the people to come into this search, into the wonders of the land. The report brought by Caleb and Joshua is called in Hebrews "glad tidings". It is the glad tidings of the land, brought to Israel through these men, but then the others engaged in the search discredited what is most precious, what is so valued by the spiritual. That is Christendom. Christendom is discrediting the whole matter of the inheritance of God; here, only two stood by the truth, and they go in. All else failed. A most solemn and far-reaching fact, and stressing the necessity of spirituality.
F.W. Do these ten suggest to us what has taken place in the public history of the church? On the line
{49}
of responsibility, everything has broken down, but power for the testimony lies in spirituality as presented in Caleb and his seed coming into his possession.
J.T. That is exactly the position, so the unbelievers proposed to return to Egypt, you will observe. "And the whole assembly lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night. And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron; and the whole assembly said to them. Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! or in this wilderness would that we had died! And why is Jehovah bringing us to this land that we may fall by the sword, that our wives and our little ones may become a prey? Is it not better for us to return to Egypt? And they said to one another, Let us make a captain, and let us return to Egypt", (@Numbers 14:1 - 4). That is pretty well what has happened. The glad tidings of the heavenly, and the purpose of God alluded to in @Hebrews 4, has been rejected in unbelief. That is what is current, falling after the same example of unbelief. It marks the whole history of Christendom; but there is a remnant, as seen here, and it goes through. Caleb and Joshua go into the land with another generation.
J.W.H. Is that seen in principle in the second epistle to Timothy? The apostle there encourages Timothy in saying that "God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power, and of love, and of wise discretion", @2 Timothy 1:7.
J.T. Quite so. That epistle provides for those who go through. Ecclesiastically this involves separation from evil. Here, the judgment falls on the rejectors of the gospel of the heavenly land; and these two, and another generation with them, go into Canaan, that is, those who came out of Egypt go into Canaan, in principle. The purpose of God, the mind of God, stands. It cannot fail, so that Israel goes in, the spiritual element that came out of Egypt goes in with a new generation.
{50}
Ques. Would you say a little about searching for forty days?
J.T. It is *a full* period. Forty is a protracted period as regards anything mentioned under that head. It is not simply three or four, but forty -- a thorough search. So that the spies cover the whole territory and it "was the time of the first grapes". Moses before that said, "take courage, and bring of the fruit of the land", and they did, the testimony was thus brought down, so that there is no excuse at all for the unbelief. And so today the testimony of the land is here, hence the solemn responsibility of those who are refusing it.
A.E.M. Would this matter of going through with another generation bear on our local meetings, in that spiritual persons should have influence and power to carry things through?
J.T. As we had before us a little last night, John deals with the idea of generation in this character. He introduces Christianity in the first chapter of his gospel saying, "as many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God, to those that believe on his name",(@John 1:12) That is, *faith is the link from Egypt into Canaan, but we must have a new generation*. So he adds, "who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh's will, nor of man's will, but of God", (@John 1:13). That is the principle, faith carrying through the identity, but a new generation is essential to the new place. We must be *of God*, children of God.
L.F. Would the spiritual move forward in the full confidence that the land does flow "with milk and honey", and that as to the enemy, "Their defence is departed from them", as seen in the statement by Joshua and Caleb in chapter 14?
J.T. That is the point. "Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, of them that searched out the land, rent their garments. And they spoke to the whole assembly of the children of Israel, saying. The
{51}
land, which we passed through to search it out, is a very, very good land. If Jehovah delight in us, he will bring us into this land, and give it to us, a land that flows with milk and honey; only rebel not against Jehovah; and fear not the people of the land; for they shall be our food. Their defence is departed from them, and Jehovah is with us: fear them not". That is, Jehovah has delight in us. John, I think, brings out in his ministry what is delightful; he was himself "the disciple whom Jesus loved (@John 21:20)". So that faith is the link between our responsible life here and our eternal portion. Faith is the *public link*, but generation is the *essential link* for eternity. There must be generation, and that is what John develops. Joshua and Caleb say, "If Jehovah delight in us". God delights in His children. He delights in those who have taken on the character of Christ.
G.M. While the whole were agreed as to the excellence of the land, the ten failed through unbelief as to what God could do for them.
J.T. They enlarged on the giants. They were at one as regards the land at first, but unbelief began to work -- and that is the solemn side of those who refuse today -- you get *inconsistencies* . Caleb says in verse 30, "Let us go up boldly and possess it, for we are well able to do it. But the men that went up with him said. We are not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we (@Numbers 13:30,31)". Caleb represents the full testimony, and the opposition shows itself as soon as unbelief begins to work -- they are inconsistent, for they say, the land eateth up its inhabitants, and in the same breath they say, "all the people that we have seen in it are men of great stature,(@Numbers 13:32)" If the land ate up its inhabitants, whence the giants? They say further, "there have we seen giants -- the sons of Anak are the giants -- and we were in our sight as grasshoppers, and so we were also in their sight", (@Numbers 13:33). All this is inconsistent, showing that when unbelief begins to work, you get the most
{52}
inconsistent things. Such contradictory things indeed mark the general doctrine of those who today reject the heavenly side of the Christian position.
W.J.H. The apostle in @Ephesians 6 did not minimise the spiritual wickednesses in heavenly places, yet he had great confidence in the power of the Spirit to strengthen them so that they should enter into their heavenly inheritance.
J.T. That is the full answer to what we have here. Ephesians is the full search, the result of the divine search in Christ. "The glory of kings is to search out a thing,(@Proverbs 25:2)" as we were saying. The whole matter is searched out by the Spirit, and Ephesians shows that in taking unto us "the whole armour of God"(@Ephesians 6:11) we are able to stand. The Father's Spirit working in us, we are "fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height(@Ephesians 3:18)".
G.A. Earlier you spoke of objective and conscious knowledge. Are Joshua and Caleb now marked, as spiritual persons, by the possession of these two features of knowledge in a balanced way?
J.T. This is evidenced in the glorious manner in which they bear witness in chapter 14:6,7: "And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, of them that searched out the land, rent their garments. And they spoke to the whole assembly of the children of Israel, saying. The land which we passed through to search it out, is a very, very good land". You can see that they are *equal* to their objective knowledge, which they have by the search; the search today has brought the knowledge of heavenly things within the range of all. The Scriptures, and the ministry God has furnished, bring the result of the search within the range of all, but then, who is equal to it in consciousness? Only very, very few, and I believe Caleb and Joshua
{53}
represent these. It is a question of being equal to what is presented objectively in the search. Caleb and Joshua have in them the moral element, being affected, and formed, by what they saw; knowing, too, God's delight in His people. They delight in the whole position, being spiritual; hence they stand and they go into the land. We are told in verse 38 of chapter 14 that Caleb and Joshua lived "still" -- the others being slain in the wilderness. Caleb characteristically inherits the land, verse 24; Jehovah calls him "my servant". He is specially the one who inherits the land, and the book of Joshua will show us later how full of the thought of it he was, how cumulative his knowledge was, how he developed in understanding and power.
G.C.S. Do you think that Caleb and Joshua alone, being spiritual men, were capable of carrying Eshcol's grapes? They had entered into the enjoyment of what they had searched out.
J.T. I agree. It is said that they "cut down thence a branch with one bunch of grapes, and they bore it between two upon a pole; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs. That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the grapes which the children of Israel had cut down there", verses 23, 24. So that it would be as it were what *all* did. Two of the whole number did it. Thus all were committed to the testimony of the fruit and fulness of the land, hence their inconsistency later, as we have seen. It must have been a wonderful bunch -- a striking testimony to the power of growth in the land at "the time of the first grapes". They could all see it because they carried it on a pole. The whole twelve had plenty of opportunity of seeing it, but only Caleb and Joshua valued what was there. I believe what we are saying is the truth, that the two men were subjectively equal to what was presented objectively in the search. The grapes were an objective thing, but the ten did not profit by it.

SPIRITUALITY (4)
@Numbers 14:26 - 38; @Numbers 20:7 - 13; @Numbers 21:16 - 20; @Numbers 26:63 - 65; @Joshua 14:6 - 15
J.T. What is in mind for this reading is to see how faith works in the believer from the point reached this morning until the believer is settled, as it were, in the inheritance; then to show how the Spirit works concurrently, indeed, supporting faith, keeping it fresh. Hence these scriptures should be considered one by one, only, being so many, we cannot remain long in considering any one of them. Christ is seen objectively in @Numbers 13 in the change of Hoshea's name to Jehoshua; the testimony was therefore enhanced; the testimony accruing from the search. The search was complete, and the testimony rendered was complete, but the element of unbelief prevailing in the ten, as over against the two, its result is to be seen. Our passage in chapter 14 shows that the judgment on the unbelievers and complainers continued for forty years in the presence of the little ones, as is said, "your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness. After the number of the days in which ye have searched out the land, forty days, each day for a year shall ye bear your iniquities forty years, and ye shall know my estrangement from you", verses 33,34. That is one solemn fact entering into the period of their little ones as they were growing up; all this happening before their eyes. They represent the generation that should inherit, and in the antitype this has to be taken up by each of us. The search was for forty days, disclosing a perfect testimony as to the heavenly land. The flesh, with its incorrigibleness, has to be judged day by day for forty years in the experience of those who
{55}
enter. In this period faith had its distinction. Then types of the Spirit follow, running along with this experience, with a view to building up spiritual constitutions. The first is in chapter 20, where the water flows and the people drink, in spite of ministerial failure. It comes through ministry, that is, through Moses and Aaron, but the ministers failing most seriously; the water, however, flowed in spite of their failure, and the people drank. It is not said in @Exodus 17 that they drank, but they drink now; meaning that there is advance in the sense of appropriation. It is said that "much water came out, and the assembly drank, and their beasts"; but the responsible ministerial element is judged; all this enters into assembly history, and individual history at the same time. Hence, chapter 21 brings out the incorrigibleness of the flesh, and its judgment in the brazen serpent, that is, sin in the flesh condemned, and faith appropriating the well. It is not the rock, but the *well* -- a digged well -- alluding to scope being made for the Holy Spirit in the believer, so that the Spirit is recognised feelingly. Then we have the prophecies of Balaam, bringing out what the people are as under God's eye, never to be cursed but blessed, and then the numbering in view of the inheritance in chapter 26. So that faith goes through, as we are told in verse 65 of that chapter, "there was not left a man of them, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun"; they go through; that is, the link between Egypt and Canaan is maintained in faith. Those whom God brings out He brings in, in identity; not in condition, but in identity; and not simply as raised from among the dead, but through faith and the Spirit developing a constitution suitable for Canaan. That is seen in the passage read in @Joshua 14. Faith is still strong, still unimpaired, as appreciative as ever of the inheritance, and even more so. That is in general what one believes the Lord would have us to ponder
{56}
over as part of our subject. Later we shall have opportunity, God willing, to consider the generation that goes in with Caleb and Joshua as in the daughters of Zelophehad and the daughter of Caleb. We ought to dwell particularly now on this point of faith going through in freshness and power accompanied and sustained by the Spirit.
A.M.H. Would you say as to faith represented in these two men, and the constitution in Caleb, and the generation that is numbered as along with them, that these account for Balaam's prophecy? What he prophesied is really there before God in substance.
J.T. Quite so. It is important to keep in mind that spiritual substance is there from the outset.
F.J.F. Is that why the Lord prayed for Peter that his faith should not fail; that thus he could go through?
J.T. Yes. If God takes up a people, or a servant, He maintains His identity through faith. Faith is the operative element on the side of the believer; it is the gift of God, but it comes by a report, and it enables the believer to go through the wilderness into the land. The Spirit is received from God; it sustains faith, so the believer may be full of faith as a man like Stephen. Scripture says he was "full of faith and the Holy Spirit", @Acts 6:5.
P.L. Does Stephen in his address indicate that he had travelled those forty years?
J.T. That is an important suggestion. Of course he travelled much more, but evidently he had judged the flesh, as it came out in the forty years.
P.L. I wondered whether all the thoughts you have suggested this afternoon are not gathered up in Stephen. Did he not reach the land, full of faith and the Holy Spirit?
J.T. That is what I thought. He is strikingly mentioned. In the @Acts 6:3 the twelve apostles say: "Look out, therefore, brethren, from among yourselves seven
{57}
men, well reported of, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we will establish over this business", then, in @Acts 6:5, "And the saying pleased the whole multitude; and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit"; in @Acts 6:8, "Stephen, full of grace and power"; in verse 10, "And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke"; in @Acts 6:15, "all who sat in the council, looking fixedly on him, saw his face as the face of an angel"; then in @Acts 7:55, "being full of the Holy Spirit ... said. Lo, I behold the heavens opened", and in the last verse, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. And kneeling down, he cried with a loud voice. Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And having said this, he fell asleep(@Acts 7:59,60)". Your remark is well supported in these passages. They show a man marked by faith and the Spirit going right through into the land.
H.D.T. Would you say a word as to Paul's charge to Timothy to maintain faith and a good conscience?
J.T. Another side surely. Someone having failed in this respect, having made shipwreck. A good conscience must go with faith, and it is therefore significant that it is said of Joshua and Caleb in @Numbers 14:38, that they "lived still of the men that had gone to search out the land". As others came under the judgment of God, they lived. That would be the idea of going through; as others fail, those who have faith live. The just live by faith.
E.B.McC. You spoke this morning of some having dropped out, but certain men whom God used to recover the truth in the last century went on to the end; Would they correspond with Joshua and Caleb?
J.T. Yes. It is a question of life. The expression, "lived still", literally means that they did not come under judgment. It is very remarkable that very soon after the death of Mr. Darby, the great subject of life came up for consideration -- the Lord reminding us
{58}
that the testimony could not go on *except through living persons*. Christianity is not simply doctrine, or principles, by themselves; it is a question of living persons; those who stand as others fall.
H.H. These were exercises of 1884 as well as 1890.
J.T. Yes, all bearing in the same direction. Certain ones were setting up a system of doctrine and making the Old Testament saints have eternal life; they were whittling down the truth, denying it really; and the Lord came in, and showed through ministry that eternal life is in Christ, and it could not be divorced from the Spirit. It was not simply something obtained through faith in Christ, but maintained by the Spirit, as the Spirit is life.
Ques. Would the thought of trading come into this, making use of what we have.
J.T. The type of the prophet's widow, @2 Kings 4, is applicable, because it relates to the use we make of the Spirit. Faith develops by the Spirit. It is not simply that I get the Spirit at a given time and rest in that, but, speaking reverently, I *use* the Spirit. The passages read indicate how faith appropriates the Spirit. The use of the Spirit, which @Romans 8 teaches us from this point of view, involves that we live. If we, by the Spirit, do mortify the deeds of the body, we live. The forty years during which these men, one by one, died in the wilderness is the testimony of God's judgment on those who fail in this. As we accept the truth of @Romans 8, putting to death the deeds of the body, we live. Then it goes on to say, "If Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin", @Romans 8:10; that is, *there should be no more sin*. If Christ comes in. He sees to that; that the body is no more a vehicle of sin, or He cannot be there; and the Spirit is life so that there should be righteousness; that is, righteousness is the development of life. The statement, "But if the Spirit of him that has raised up Jesus from among the dead dwell in you",(@Romans 8:11) shows what a great
{59}
thought is in mind, in @Romans 8, regarding the Spirit. It is the Spirit of that Man that is so pleasing to God. Then it says, "he that has raised up Christ from among the dead shall quicken your mortal bodies also on account of his Spirit which dwells in you,(@Romans 8:11)". So that the position is secured right through in a practical way, not simply on the principle of faith, but in addition to that, through the Spirit. If we are alive and remain when the Lord comes, with the Spirit dwelling in us, we shall be quickened -- our mortal bodies will be quickened -- on account of that Spirit.
A.E.D. Would the thought of sowing to the Spirit and reaping eternal life fit in with what has been suggested, @Galatians 6:8?
J.T. Yes. You reap eternal life by sowing to the Spirit.
F.J.F. Would you say that those who have left on account of surrendering the light of the truth and the path of faith, have surrendered the Lord's presence by doing so, and thus are in estrangement?
J.T. I think that is right. You are alluding to the word "estrangement" in @Numbers 14:34: "After the number of the days in which ye have searched out the land, forty days, each day for a year shall ye bear your iniquities forty years, and ye shall know mine estrangement from you". This is the attitude God takes up, *estrangement*. Their house is left desolate.
L.D.M. Did Moses cause estrangement when he smote the rock instead of speaking to it?
J.T. Moses has to suffer having this incident recorded, so that we may see how God resents the failure of those representing the public ministry at the present time. Those who profess to minister the truth have failed, but nevertheless the water flows. That is, the dispensation is maintained in spite of their failure, but God does not pass over their failure; they were not to go into the land, that is the point. Moses did not fail in
{60}
a *characteristic* sense, for he was faithful in all God's house. This incident is regarded as representing ministry typically.
E.E.S.L. Did they fail in misrepresenting God?
J.T. Moses used the wrong rod, and he was not told to smite the rock, but to speak to it. We all know how the clerisy loves authority; indeed, it has been so all down the history, since the introduction of the clerical principle. Scripture says, "Moses took the staff from before Jehovah, as he had commanded him. And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said to them. Hear now, ye rebels: shall we bring forth to you water out of this rock? And Moses lifted up his hand, and with *his* staff smote the rock twice, and much water came out, and the assembly drank, and their beasts", @Numbers 20:9 - 11. With *his* staff he smote the rock; the staff of authority; whereas the truth is, that inasmuch as priesthood had been fully vindicated in chapters 16 to 18, smiting has already taken place. Christ is Priest in heaven as having died, and *speaking to Him* is now all that is needed. Moses used the rod of authority, falsifying the position, and that, really, is the history of the clergy, but yet the water is flowing; the rock is there, thank God!
N.B.S. What is the thought in God's instruction to Moses to speak to the rock?
J.T. Christ being in heaven, this is the time of *speaking*, not of smiting. Christ is in heaven and the Holy Spirit is here. It is the period of the word of God and our freely addressing Him, @1 Timothy 4:5.
N.K.McC. Why are the beasts brought in in @Numbers 20 and not in @Exodus 17?
J.T. They are live stock and come under God's care. They have a place right through from Egypt. I think it would be also to bring out the plentifulness of the water.
A.M.H. Is this *speaking* to characterise the whole of
{61}
the ministry in the present day? For instance, "in meekness setting right those who oppose", @2 Timothy 2:25. Undue pressing, or forcing of a matter, would be a denial of the character of the moment.
J.T. Quite so. The servant of the Lord must not strive. We know how, from Rome and all patterned after it, much stress is laid on authority. No doubt that is what is meant; in the antitype we see what was in the mind of God. Moses has to suffer so that we might see this great thought as applicable to us now.
H.J.M. Is it intended that true ministers should use the rod of priesthood, and so speak to Christ, as the Rock, that God is hallowed before the eyes of the people? The character of the moment is to hallow Him by addressing Christ as the Rock.
J.T. I think that is the thought. A feature of clericalism viewed by itself (not that some sharing in it are not godly men) is that authority is needed to sustain the thing. Rome is sustained by the constant assertion of mere human authority, which God hates. God would never record this of Moses and Aaron were it not for our education as to what it typifies. He loved them too well, but they have to suffer on our account. God brings this out in order to show how abhorrent is the attitude of the clerical system, which it represents; going so far as to speak to the people of God in this disrespectful way -- calling them rebels.
H.H. Paul's conduct at Corinth would be quite different to Moses using the rod. I suppose there is a relation between Numbers and Corinthians.
J.T. He refrains from using the rod, but he put it to them as to whether he should come with the rod. He preferred to come in love, and the way was made open for this.
In @Numbers 21 we have the Spirit again, not coming in through ministerial work, but as the well itself. The idea of the rock is in Christ, but in an objective sense.
{62}
The Rock which followed them was Christ, @1 Corinthians 10:4. It was there, and in spite of the objectionable action of Moses, the water flowed, because typically it was still the period of grace, and the Lord is not going to be limited because of ministerial failure. The character of the present dispensation must be maintained. Christ is still on the Father's throne, and the Spirit is still here, and that is the line He is on. Sin in the flesh is dealt with in chapter 21 in the brazen serpent, and now the Spirit is viewed, as we say, in a subjective sense. It is the well. "From thence to Beer(which means well), that is the well of which Jehovah spoke to Moses, Assemble the people, and I will give them water", chapter 21:16. Without any reference to the rock or to ministry, "Then Israel sang this song, Rise up well, sing unto it" -- "respond unto it", is said in the note. There is a response to the Spirit in this sense. It is a question of the well, but the well in the believer, the well of water springing up into everlasting life, so that we read, "Well which princes digged, which the nobles of the princes hollowed out at the word of the law giver, with their staves", verse 18. Now we have reached the supply, which is dependent *on our state and not on ministerial action* . It is within the scope of each believer. So that it is a question of digging, that is to say, of making room for the Spirit.
E.B.McC. Could we give this an application today, the princes digging the well being the ministry that is coming to us today? We have ministry meetings, is that the well of water springing up in our midst?
J.T. It is a question of moral authority - princes digging at the word of the law-giver. God had said of this well, "that is the well of which Jehovah spoke to Moses, Assemble the people, and I will give them water", and then there is the song including the digging. It is a matter of authority, not merely the exercise of gift in ministry. We are on the way to finality, for the
{63}
Spirit is within our own scope according to John's point of view; it is a question of our state. The Spirit is given to the believer and it becomes in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. Digging is making room for the Spirit -- removing what hinders *with authority*.
H.H. "Shall become in him ..." @John 4:14.
J.T. Quite so; @Romans 7 and 8 also correspond with this type.
E.E.S.L. What kind of action is contemplated by this gathering of the people together, and the princes digging the well?
J.T. I suppose it is gathering in the sense that the saints are united. We are under divine ordering. Of course it implied a literal gathering together then, but as applied to us it is the general thought of gathering. We have two thoughts in @Acts 2; first that they were together in one place when the Holy Spirit came, and then in the end of the chapter, all that believed were together, and hence the things that are stated of them. This principle of being together operates so that the Holy Spirit has scope. He is within our range, as it were. God gives Him, of course, but here it is the springing up through digging. It is a definite place here, "Beer"; a point to be reached, not a rock, but a well; hence the movements afterwards, as we have often noticed, "from the wilderness they went to Mattanah", and so on; a steady movement towards the land; no longer a zigzag course, but a course out of the wilderness into the land, where the judgment of God does not apply.
W.J.H. As you said, that is suggested in @Romans 8, where so much is said about the Spirit; being led by the Spirit of God; being the sons of God, and being glorified.
J.T. Yes, especially where it is said, "as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God", @Romans 8:14.
{64}
It would answer to this type, as the Spirit is fully recognised in the believer. Then there is movement towards the land, because He *leads* now. The believer uses the Spirit, but then He leads the believer towards the land.
G.M. God was finding pleasure in His people!
J.T. There would be no estrangement now. We overcome the estrangement on these lines. God is complacent in us, "Gather the people together, and I will give them water".
In chapter 14 you have those who live, while others die; those who live on the principle of faith, and then in chapter 15 God says, "When ye come into the land (@Numbers 15:2)". That further light in your soul is assuring as conveying the purpose of God. It gives you balance, as affording the certainty of believers being brought into the land. Then chapter 16 is the awful rebellion of Korah, which brings in the establishment of the priesthood in Aaron, on the principle of life. That is, Aaron's staff bears fruit over night, and in appropriate order, budding, blossoming, and ripening almonds; thus priesthood is established in life. That is the lesson of this chapter. God would say to Moses and Aaron, *Now act on that principle* . It is a question of life now, not of smiting. It is a living order of things. It is Christ's priesthood, as He is above. He is living to make intercession for us. He is available for us. "Such a high priest became us, holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and become higher than the heavens", @Hebrews 7:26. That is our Priest; that is the position; God now directs Moses to Aaron's rod, saying, "Take the rod", that is, the priestly rod, which is laid up in the tabernacle, Numbers 20:7,9. Moses takes *the* rod, but he uses *his own* rod for smiting, using it twice, calling the people rebels. This is the great failure we have been speaking of. These chapters afford important lessons in relation to our subject, especially as to faith and the Spirit.
{65}
Ques. Would the period that intervened between the smiting of the rock and the digging of the well suggest that they had not continuously availed themselves of that which God had given?
J.T. The facts stated at the beginning of chapter 20 show that they had not availed themselves of the Rock that followed them, but it is there amongst them, and God would have them to drink now. Hence He directs Moses to use the priestly rod, but chapter 21 is further on, "Assemble the people, and I will give them water"; the water takes the form of a well, not a rock, meaning it is now in the saints and is to spring up. The Rock is an objective thought, that is Christ, but the well is in ourselves. Then the prophecies of Balaam come in; God holding him in His own hands, so that there should not be a word from Balaam but what is in keeping with God's own mind as to the people. They are not to be cursed at all, for they are blessed. God is pleased with them. The enemy would curse them, but God blesses them. It is irrevocable, so that through these prophecies we are established as to the mind of God. Then God counts His people again. We find they have not diminished, the numbers are about the same as they were forty years before; but the only ones remaining of those who came out of Egypt are Caleb and Joshua. They represent the element of faith sustained by the Spirit of God; and Caleb, in @Joshua 14, says of himself in effect, that he is in faith and in the power of the Spirit. He reaches the inheritance on the line of faith and the Spirit, and he is as vigorous as he was forty-five years before, showing how faith is sustained, and how God looks for this in us.
Ques. To maintain us in fruitful spirituality, do we need plenty of water?
J.T. Quite so; so that these allusions to the Spirit that we have been reviewing, account for the vigour of Caleb at eighty-five years of age. He was as vigorous as
{66}
he was at forty. The secret is faith and the Spirit; he is a spiritual man from the beginning; it says of him, as he is introduced to us, that he was a man of another spirit. He says, "I brought him word again as it was in my heart". That is the man; he was spiritual, thoroughly appreciating what God had purposed for His people.
Ques. Does Caleb suggest that state in the Spirit which goes right through?
J.T. That is what I am seeking to show, and how important it is for us all to go through in this sense -- in spiritual vigour. In this way we bear testimony to the power of Christianity, that we die in faith. "All these died in faith", @Hebrews 11:13. Well, if *they* did, why not we? They did not have the Spirit; we have; so that if the will of God requires that we die, then we die in faith and in spiritual power as well.
A.M.H. Would it be right to say that whatever the people were basically as brought out of Egypt, they are now characteristically such as cannot be cursed, but they must be blessed?
J.T. Yes. The brazen serpent having come in, God has dealt with sin in the flesh, so that whoever looked *lived* . In the antitype that is eternal life, which is God's blessing. @Psalm 133. Joshua and Caleb lived. But now he that believeth has eternal life. So that we go through. The Spirit sustains us. Eternal life is not simply through faith, I do get it by faith at the outset, but it is sustained by the Spirit. To divorce it from the Spirit is fatal.
E.S.W. Would it be right to say that at the outset faith takes precedence of the Spirit with us, but we come to see eventually that the Spirit takes precedence over faith? Both are needed to enter into the land.
J.T. Faith and hope shall cease, but the Spirit does not. In eternity He takes the form in us of the Spirit of adoption.
W.J.H. Paul seems one like Caleb. At the beginning
{67}
he brings the report to Ephesus of all the counsel of God, and goes on with that, and "being such a one as Paul the aged,(@Philemon 9)" there is no diminution of spiritual power.
J.T. In the letter to Ephesus which we have had mentioned before, he enlarged on unity among the brethren. He turned aside in the parenthesis of chapter 3 to speak of himself and the knowledge he had of the mystery -- he wanted them to know this. They did not have all that he had, but *what he had was available* to them. It is involved in the search, as was remarked; and in chapter 4 he stresses unity.
L.D.M. Did Caleb have his eye on Hebron from the moment that he saw it in the land?
J.T. Evidently, and so we are told it was built before Zoan -- that is, it represents what was before the world. He wanted something that was before this world. Of course his forefathers -- Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob -- all had been there. Hebron was well known in the family of faith.
H.D.T. You spoke of Ephesians going further than Colossians. What had you particularly in mind?
J.T. Ephesians fully develops the counsels of God. So that it is "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ ... having marked us out beforehand for adoption through Jesus Christ to himself, ... . taken us into favour in the Beloved", @Ephesians 1:3 - 6. The full thought of the search is in Ephesians.
A.H. They journeyed after this song. This is the second song, is it not? After this song they journeyed.
J.T. They journeyed also, we read, after the first song, which is an objective thing. It was Moses and the children of Israel, but Moses leading. We are told that Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea. It is a question of the leadership of Moses, but now it is
{68}
typically the leadership of the Spirit. "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God", @Romans 8:14. That is what is implied in this type. They went from Mattanah to Nahaliel and so on, and reached Pisgah, which looks over the surface of the waste. So they moved forward and, I suppose, took a view of the past -- "the surface of the waste"; but they are now moving out of the wilderness. *The Spirit leads us out of the wilderness* . He leads us in the wilderness, but leads us out of the wilderness, and that is the point here. It leads on to Canaan.
A.M.H. Why is this digging at the word of the lawgiver instead of the priest? One would have thought it was more a priestly matter.
J.T. I think it is the *authority* of Christ as in Romans.
F.J.F. What does Caleb mean when he says "to go out and to come in", in @Joshua 14?
J.T. It is liberty, I suppose. "I am the door; if any one enter in by me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and shall go out and shall find pasture", @John 10:9. I suppose there is liberty in a general way. We know how it applied to David. He brought Israel out and brought them in. It is one thing to lead the saints out, and another to bring them in, but then here, it is a person himself going out and coming in, and we are to learn to do that. A trustworthy person can do that.
E.E. Would you say a little more about the lawgiver?
J.T. I think it is Christ as presented in Romans; the authority of Christ is there in relation to digging. In fact how can you get on without it? It applies to oneself. You can see, for instance, in the woman of Samaria how she understood the teaching of the Lord. "The water which I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life", @John 4:14. How she would need the teaching of Romans to be subject, to teach her the feature of subjection, for the Holy Spirit only operates in those
{69}
who are subject. The gospel is for the *obedience* of faith, among all nations, and the Spirit is given to those who obey. So that while we are down here we need the authority of Christ.
A.M.H. The authority of Christ would help us to recognise and remove obstacles so that the Spirit would be free unhinderedly.
J.T. Yes. "I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord", (@Romans 7:25) is a recognition of the Lord's authority; and the subject of the Spirit is afterwards opened up. @Romans 7 really implies making room for the Spirit, in some sense, because you have reached the ability to name inward things, so as to disallow sin in the flesh, what would hinder the Spirit.
P.L. So that spiritual ministry always bears the stamp of divine authority -- speaking as oracles of God.
J.T. Just so.
{70}
SPIRITUALITY (5)
@Numbers 27, @Joshua 15:16 - 19; @Joshua 17:3 - 6
J.T. Our inquiry so far has brought us to the end of @Numbers 26, in which it is stated that "there was not left a man of them, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun(@Numbers 26:65)". The passage in @Joshua 14 was read yesterday afternoon to show how *faith* , up to this point, is the leading thought, the link between the beginning of divine movements in Egypt and the land of Canaan; marking, too, the identity of the persons, but their *condition* is wholly changed according to certain passages read in Numbers, particularly those which treat typically of the Spirit. The forty years¬ journeying in the wilderness after the exposure of the flesh in @Numbers 13 and 14 is a witness to the destruction of what was disobedient. The apostle says in @2 Corinthians 10:6, "and having in readiness to avenge all disobedience when your obedience shall have been fulfilled"; meaning those who have faith. The little ones, or children of the transgressors, were to see the destruction of their fathers during those forty years. For faith, this would mean that the flesh in each one is destroyed, all discipline having that in mind, the "destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus(@1 Corinthians 5:5)". Hence God deals with us in discipline through history on the one hand, but on the other hand, where faith is, there is the Spirit building up a constitution, and this involves spirituality. Faith is seen in these two men, and they go through into Canaan, and the children of those who were destroyed inherit according to the divine word.
Now it is thought that we may see in the Scriptures read, how *the children* are in the inheritance. The qualities of which they were constituted are seen
{71}
representatively in the daughters of Zelophehad and the daughter of Caleb. The children of those who came under the judgment of God were to inherit, and these daughters of Zelophehad and the daughter of Caleb are representative as showing that if they inherit, they do so as formed by the Spirit. They have the qualities suitable for the inheritance. They did not go in simply because they were children when the disobedience took place, and so were not responsible; they go in as *suitable* , as subjects of the work of God. "The daughters of Zelophehad speak right", according to Jehovah's own testimony. Their thought is, as they say, "Why should the name of our father be taken away from his family, because he has no son? Give unto us a possession among the brethren of our father", @Numbers 27:4. That is their exercise; they wanted a possession in the inheritance of their father, but they wished to enjoy it among the *brethren* ; an excellent trait in persons who enjoy the inheritance of God. Then Achsah, Caleb's daughter, as already possessing the inheritance, desires to have what sustains in it, namely springs of water. These two families illustrate how the inheritance is laid hold of by the children.
P.L. Would it be right to say that the confession that their father died in his own sin, and also of his sonless position -- five of them, suggestive of weakness in remnant days, taking that ground -- shows that they had bowed to the government of God in regard of the forty years?
J.T. That is so. Saying that he died in his own sin, as distinct from the sin of Korah, would indicate that they understood sin in the gravest sense - that of a party active against the truth. They do not allude to the refusal to go into the land, which marked the ten spies at that time, but they allude to Korah's sin, which will take us down the history typically; sin evidenced, not only in the refusal of the land, but in the terrible
{72}
rebellion of the clerical system. They understood that their father had died in his own sin -- it was not a collective sin for which he died; there was no collusion in it. They indicate in all this that they had a just judgment about the sin of Korah and his band. In putting forward their matter, they recognised the principle governing the position. "They stood before Moses", the passage says, "and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and the whole assembly". The book of Joshua says, "they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes". That is, they recognised their position in a divinely appointed economy. They were intelligent in their approach in making their plea, showing that in the antitype they were *assembly people*, they knew what to do. They were not marked by lawlessness.
P.L. Would you say that the expression *drawing near*, which attaches to the three scriptures dealing with them, would suggest that they had drunk into the spirit, so to speak, of their great ancestor Joseph, who says to his brethren *draw near*? The birthright going to Joseph would fit in with their desire for it.
J.T. These were tribal features.
W.J.H. Had you in mind, in regard to their father dying "in his own sin", that personal failure and breakdown is less serious than party activities among God's people, and that there is less hope of recovery in the latter?
J.T. Yes. The sin of Korah is outstanding linked up, in Jude's epistle, with Cain and Balaam; showing the seriousness of party affiliations amongst the brethren, which are ever ready to crop up. It is very striking that they distinguish between their father's sin and the sin of Korah.
J.D.U. Is that an indication of spiritual formation with them? They duly estimated the sin, and also appreciated the inheritance.
{73}
J.T. Although the personal sin was there, the name of their father was not to be wiped out or forgotten. I suppose they had the idea of grace, one of the features of the assembly, introduced at the very outset and embodied in the word that "The Lord is indeed risen and *has appeared to Simon*(@Luke 24:34)" -- that was pure grace.
E.B.C. Do they connect the thought of generation with the inheritance?
J.T. That is the point we are on, to show how these women represent a generation. John's line enters into this; it is not only generation, but suitable family development. The idea of an inheritance must involve the family; it comes down from the parent. It is not a creational thought, it is a family thought.
H.D.T. In regard to the question of grace, in @Acts 4:33 it says "great grace was upon them all". That precedes those who had lands coming forward and making them available.
J.T. It is one of the features of the economy, running parallel with the breaking of bread. The two things are seen in the first assembly after the Lord arose, the breaking of bread and grace; the latter recognised in that the Lord appeared to an individual sinner -- Simon. There was no party link at all, just his own sin, and the Lord appeared to *him* . So that his name stands; Judas's does not, neither does Korah's name stand in the family of God. In that sense the name of Zelophehad does. Then the two disciples from Emmaus witnessed to the breaking of bread -- the Lord was made known to them in it. So that the divine economy as initially inaugurated stands thus. The *name* of Christ attaches to that position, and so, too, the *children* in John's writings -- "those that believe *on his name*(@John 1:12)".
H.H. Referring to faith and spirituality as necessary for the inheritance, I was thinking of the expression in the gospel of John, "he that believeth"; this is in
{74}
addition to the work of God seen there, as set out in individuals such as the blind man.
J.T. Faith is stressed in the children of God -- those "that believe on his name" (@John 1:12) -- and they are also said to be "born of God". John speaks of persons, who already are disciples, coming to believe; they thus add to and strengthen their faith; "his disciples believed on him", @John 2:11. John contemplates persons believing because of the signs which the Lord did, but they were not trustworthy. That brought out the *necessity for new birth* . In the second chapter the Lord "manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him(@John 2:11)". John has in mind that there should be a real abiding faith that goes through, so that at the end, he says, the signs "are written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name", @John 20:31. Alongside of that is the great enlargement of the truth of the Holy Spirit in John, first in new birth and then in the living water, and later in a personal sense.
F.I. Do you have in mind that when these women came up before Moses and the whole assembly, they had a sense that they would get a judgment which would be supported by grace?
J.T. That is the point; what underlies the assembly, as representative of God, is grace. They had *confidence* in coming before Moses and Eleazar and the princes of the assembly. The full economy of God is in mind. John states it: "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand,(@John 3:35)" that is the idea of the divine economy in John. It is stable, you can rely on it. In Matthew the Lord says, "if also he will not listen to the assembly, let him be to thee as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer(@Matthew 18:17)". Christ delegates the authority there, thus the assembly is to be listened to. Christianity, abstractly, is on a firm foundation, even as to administration.
{75}
A.M.H. Did they recognise the lack of faith in their father, and desire that *they* should not fail in relation to faith?
J.T. That is a moral necessity if the father's name is to stand in the inheritance. "Why", they say, "should the name of our father be taken away from his family?" It is with a sense of grace that they include a request that the name of their father should not be taken away.
P.L. This inquiry addressed to Moses, Eleazar, and the princes, sets afoot the later inquiry Godward, and results in a statute set up in Israel. Is this an encouragement for spiritual initiative and zeal in regard to one's part in the inheritance?
J.T. The definite statute set up, "a statute of right", shows how God honours their exercises in adding the result to the statutes of Israel. The statutes and ordinances of Israel mentioned so often in @Psalm 119 show how faith valued them. In @Numbers 27:11, we read, "it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of right, as Jehovah commanded Moses". It is a great matter if a crisis like this brings out an addition to what is already there. A point is reached; a landmark in the spiritual history of Israel, that is to stand in regard to the inheritance. The inheritance is a final thought. This "statute of right" is a very important addition to what was already there, and the next thing is how these women carry forward their thought. They had not forgotten this matter. They went into the land, and again recognised the economy as it was. They had admitted their father's sin, now it is a settled matter. They say, "Jehovah commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren"; then is added, "And he", that is, Joshua, "gave them according to the commandment of Jehovah". They condensed the thing. They assumed that matters were settled legally. They do not again allude to the sin of their father, but we get an additional thing: Joshua gave
{76}
them "an inheritance among the brethren of their father"; then we are told, "And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which are beyond the Jordan. For the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance among his sons; and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead", @Joshua 17:5,6. So that it would seem that these women got the very best. It was *Canaan* they sought, not Gilead.
H.S.H. Why does the inheritance of these women come in again at the close of Numbers in regard to marriage?
J.T. That is an important side of our subject which may be reserved to a meeting later on if the Lord will. The brethren here have some exercise about mixed marriages.
Ques. Is it important that it is *not only their claim, but Jehovah's matter*, and He justifies them in the place where they invoke the name of Jehovah, and gives them the best portion in the land?
J.T. What comes out is that these women are honoured; their exercise brings in a "statute of right". It is a very remarkable thing that God honours them in this way. Jehovah adds, in @Numbers 27:7: "thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them", and the end of verse 11 states that "it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of right". It seems to me that this statute of right is very important today, because our relatives are so distant from us in many instances, but we can share the inheritance with them, however far they may seem to be from us. The link of the family, however attenuated, is maintained. I think that ought to help us in regard to our brethren now. John speaks of "the children of God who were scattered abroad @John 11:52". Perhaps many have little or no idea of any link with
{77}
others. This statute of right is a divine provision that brings them in for a portion in the inheritance.
C.S.S. You have spoken of generation; is it seen in @John 4, where the Lord speaks of worshipping the Father, before He speaks of worship to God?
J.T. Quite so. That would show that in grace He was bringing the woman in. She was claiming relation with Jacob, but it was not valid. The Lord implied that He was a Jew, and she regarded Him in that light and He accepted it. She had no family claim, but He brings her in, in grace. She comes into the inheritance; the living water, which comes into our subject, being essential to it.
A.E.D. Does Paul use this statute of right in @Ephesians 2 in bringing us Gentiles into the inheritance?
J.T. That is right. It depends on family link, which we Gentiles now have: "no longer strangers and foreigners but ... of the household of God(@Ephesians 2:19)".
A.E.M. A distribution of the inheritance comes down to the one that is nearest to him. Is that an important principle in trying to help?
J.T. Yes. "Ye shall give his inheritance to his kinsman that is nearest to him in his family", @Numbers 27:11. I suppose the idea of family in John, the generative thought, allows for great extension. We recognise when it is valued by any, and we can move in relation to them, owning them as our brethren.
A.M.H. Would the loaf in the Lord's supper keep this before us, that, what we are about to go forward to, is not limited to ourselves?
J.T. We being many are one bread, by extension, includes all Christians. One misses them and tells the Lord so. Many may be without the Spirit, but there is a link with the family nevertheless, and evidence of the divine generation affords one a claim as of the family.
S.E.E. Would the statute of right be established in
{78}
the passage in @John 1:12, "but as many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God"?
J.T. Quite so: it is for them to take up. The passage referred to in @John 11 does not contemplate the ability to do it. They are "scattered abroad", but the right is there, and it is part of our work at the present time to instruct people on these lines. John's gospel is intended for that.
E.S.W. All these relationships seem to stand in relation to the Father. Would it extend to every family in heaven or on earth, named of the Father?
J.T. That is the way it works out. Paul speaks of one God the Father, not many fathers, but one.
E.E. The impoverished conditions through the workings of sin make things more difficult even for those who are spiritually minded to come into their proper portion.
J.T. The apostle warned that difficult times should come, and they *have* come. You are made to feel it when you come in contact with those who belong to the family, but are not in practical enjoyment of it; many are prejudiced and preoccupied, but this passage gives us a wide area to operate in; we should seek to impress them with the fact that they belong to the family of God. If you say to a person who is hard. You are my brother, -- one has often noticed that the word *brother* touches any one who has family instincts.
J.D. You mentioned those who are scattered abroad; in dealing with souls, would you look for the features of the generation according to @John 1?
J.T. Certainly, that is the point here. When travelling and meeting people you cannot but see in some the evidences of divine generation, but they are terribly beclouded and hardened through circumstances, as has been remarked, the circumstances of sin, and religious circumstances, and I think John's gospel is intended to meet that. You begin with Christ, the Person of Christ.
{79}
If there is reality in any one, he will respond to the opening verses of John's gospel, and then in verses 12 and 13 you come to persons who receive Him. Are you receiving Christ? If you are, you have the right to take the place of a child, as believing on His name, which disallows all other names; and you are born, not of the will of the flesh, or the will of man, but of God. How peerless it is, and what stability it gives us as having faith in Christ, believing on His name!
J.D. Would the coming forward of the feminine side -- the daughters of Zelophehad -- involve the subjective state, consequent upon generation?
J.T. That is right. There may be much to be learnt from their names, and there should be, but the general thought is that they represent the subjective side. They speak with a right feeling. God is honouring them. I believe they represent those who are fully fit for the inheritance. They value it and speak intelligently about it. They wish to bring down the name of their father, and to be among their brethren. What fine traits these are!
As to Achsah, @Joshua 15, the question of the husband comes in. In this spiritual order of things, we must have that feature, which has place as entering into our minds. So Caleb says, "He that smites Kirjath-sepher and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife. And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife". We are now in the marital state. She is a child of Caleb, of the man who has come through, the man of faith. He has come through from Egypt to Canaan. Identity is there and the marriage thought is there, and what is her exercise about the position? Verse 18 says, "And it came to pass that as she came, that she urged him to ask of her father a field": that is, she urged her husband, "and she sprang down from the ass". She is spiritual and she has spiritual agility. I think that is what
{80}
is meant by the word "sprang". "And Caleb said to her. What wouldest thou?" She recognised her father in her movement off the ass; and she said, "Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a southern land; give me also springs of water. Then he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs". That is another fine part of our subject, showing what marked both the children of parents who had fallen, and the child of parents who went through in faith. She wanted springs of water, and he gave her more than she asked, he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
C.S.S. Does this come on the line of desire and dependence on God as one man who could pray, "Oh that thou wouldest richly bless me, and enlarge my border", @1 Chronicles 4:10.
J.T. Quite so. In the book of Chronicles you get touches of that kind in the history. The idea of the inheritance is there in one man -- Jabez -- and God granted him all his desires; showing what is available at any time to any who has desires.
C.C.E. Have you any thought why this incident as to Achsah is repeated in the book of Judges?
J.T. I think, to carry on this fine thought of the inheritance in the family of Caleb, showing what a start the tribes had in the land. We have this thought carried through; a woman wishing for springs of water. *It is a subjective* thought. You could not have the book of Joshua without this; and so you find the son of Eleazar the priest -- Phinehas -- in the end of the book, God thus showing what continues.
W.J.H. Is Paul like Caleb, as he comes to Ephesus and raises the question of whether they had received the Holy Spirit in view of occupying this blessed territory?
J.T. Yes. That is the basic idea, consequent on the gospel, in Ephesus, as if the matter of the Spirit must be settled at once. There can be no going through into the counsels of God without it.
{81}
H.H. Would you say a word as to the upper and nether springs?
J.T. I think the upper would be like Ephesians and the nether like Romans. Colossians hardly touches on the Spirit, except "love in the Spirit". The Spirit is not stressed in Colossians. It is the *going into* the land there. In Romans you have great enlargement as to the truth of the Spirit, and then in Ephesians the Spirit in relation to heavenly things.
E.E. While speaking of Achsah, what is there for us in that she moved her husband to ask for a field?
J.T. I think she is recognising headship, he is the one to take the initiative. That is what I understand. She is thoroughly right in the matter, just as the daughters of Zelophehad were right. She recognises her husband.
F.I. As you have already said, the marital side enters into this; what he received she was able to name properly. She urged her husband to ask for a field; she had received a southern land; but she rose to the highest thoughts, and would have springs of water.
J.T. She recognised her husband. She urged him to ask of her father a field; and she sprang down from the ass. She is in the right attitude of subjection, and Caleb said, "What wouldest thou?" She was where she would get answers: "And she said, give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a southern land; give me also springs of water". It was the time of asking and she took advantage of it. God loves that in His people and responds to it. Elisha says to Elijah, "let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me(@2 Kings 2:9)". Elijah says, "Thou hast asked a hard thing: if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so to thee", (@2 Kings 2:10). This would mean that the gift of the Spirit requires such a state. It is not simply the position of Romans, but the *ascending* thought, the heavenly position. You get a double portion in view of that.
{82}
What a great position Achsah was in! Her husband had just taken Kirjath-sepher, which is *The city of books*, and she is consciously in need of support in this great position. How can I overcome the influence of books save by the Spirit? I lay hold of the mind of God and live in the mind of God, and man's books do not influence me.
W.J.H. At Ephesus they burnt certain books as they came into the light of what Paul brought them.
J.T. That helps in what we are saying. We have to transfer these types into our own circumstances, because they are for us. Books have an immense place at the present time, and saints are damaged by them, but the Spirit enables us to overcome them. We touch certain subjects -- history and such like as we need, but we are not overcome by them; we overcome them by the help of the Spirit.
L.D.M. The Spirit is the earnest of our inheritance.
J.T. Yes; the *earnest* would mean you get it in principle now, enabling you to overcome what is presented in the books and the like, what controls the world.
E.S.W. Would you link these two great features with the Lord's supper? Our place in the body with a view of the inheritance, and spiritual joy to enable us to go forward into it.
J.T. That is right. The Spirit, of course, is with us in assembly from the outset, in fact. He is always with us in the sense of the anointing. At a certain point there is an upward trend, which would imply the Spirit of adoption. In His power we are carried over to the heavenly side of things.
E.E.S.L. What is the inheritance? Is it the whole of that which God has made available in the word for our possession and enjoyment in divine things?
J.T. It is a very wide thought. We touched on it yesterday as to what the spies were to inquire into;
{83}
what they were to find out, and in order to indicate the variety of things, @Deuteronomy 8:7 - 10 helps us, "For Jehovah thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of waterbrooks, of springs, and of deep waters, that gush forth in the valleys and hills; a land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig-trees, and pomegranates; a land of olive-trees and honey; a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, where thou shalt lack nothing; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose mountains thou wilt dig copper. And thou shalt eat and be filled, and shalt bless Jehovah thy God for the good land which he hath given thee". This passage indicates the things that are there. You get indications of it later; for instance, in Jonathan's victory, it is said that the honey flowed. So that the idea of it was carried down. It is a spiritual matter for us -- what we enter into according to Ephesians. The Spirit is said to be the earnest of it, and it is brought to us by the Spirit in principle, but only in that sense, not the complete fulness of it, so that we are carried through. In Ephesians the Spirit is the earnest of the inheritance, extending "to the redemption of the acquired possession(@Ephesians 1:14)".
J.W.H. Does that connect with the bunch of grapes?
J.T. That was the testimony to it. The "first" grapes, to show how productive the land was; pomegranates and figs were also brought down.
W.J.H. It is spoken of throughout scripture as the land that flows with milk and honey; could you help us to get a spiritual thought as to that general expression?
J.T. I suppose there is the thought of the Messiah, Emmanuel, that we share it with Him, @Isaiah 7. Although from living creatures, butter and honey would not necessitate their death.
Ques. Do we have to claim the inheritance as the daughters of Zelophehad did?
J.T. That is the thought. God values our going forward in this sense, especially claiming it amongst
{84}
the brethren. Esau stands over against all this. He sold his birthright for a mess of pottage.
J.S.D. While we come into the inheritance in a corporate way, why are the various portions allotted, to some in one way, and some in another?
J.T. Each will have his portion in the land. The boundaries of the tribes are carefully maintained, possibly alluding in some instances to the test we are to one another, because the boundaries are sometimes very irregular, and one tribe, such as Simeon, had his inheritance inside that of Judah. There is irregularity in that sense in Joshua, which I suppose alludes to our responsibility here -- to bring out our love, in bearing with one another. In Ezekiel, the boundaries are in a straight line, the inheritance of each is straight across the land. There is no such test implied in the coming day as there is now. Nevertheless each tribe has its own setting.
C.S.S. Is the new generation to take full possession of the land?
J.T. Achsah asked for springs of water and she urged her husband to ask for a field -- two definite things, but both are available. The idea is that you want some feature or features, and *asking* is in order. God is urging us now in what we have before us *to lay hold of the inheritance and to understand what is in it. Springs* of water are of particular importance.
E.E.S.L. Would the Spirit of God in taking up these daughters of Zelophehad and Achsah, place before us a contrast to the selfishness and lack of appreciation which Israel showed, and which resulted in their carcases falling in the wilderness?
J.T. Quite so. God urges us to lay hold of the things He has prepared for us -- for those who love Him.
{85}
SPIRITUALITY (6)
@Deuteronomy 1:1 - 5,35 - 38; @Deuteronomy 31:1 - 8,14 - 19; @Deuteronomy 34:9
A.E.M. We would be glad of a word as to how the generative principle, which involves our being of God, stands related to the idea of adoption which is through Jesus Christ to Himself.
J.T. The generative thought, as far as I understand it, stands related to the saints as *children*. Adoption, or sonship, is *conferred*. We are said to be "God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus", in @Galatians 3:26; and in @Galatians 4:5,6 we are said to receive it, "that we might receive sonship. But because ye are sons, God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba Father", The generative idea is seen in our being born of God. *It is constitutional and underlies our sonship*. We are said to be "born of the Spirit" and "born of water and of Spirit", in @John 3:5. Birth by the Spirit involves what is substantive spiritually, that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. It is something, as it were, substantive, and hence basic as to our family relations with God. Then we are said to be born of incorruptible seed, the word of God which liveth and abideth for ever: this affecting us as to our intelligence; and finally we are said to be born of God, from whom we take on the family characteristics, which are developed in John's first epistle. The generative thought is obviously connected with what has been before us; for in the types we have considered, there are numerous children, not exactly children of God, but typical of them as a new generation; the principle being there, involving nature and ability to take in and to enjoy what is of God.
A.E.M. Is the thought of children on the same level as sonship?
J.T. As to family status. Yes. Only sonship is greater,
{86}
as that in which Christ has part, and it is the final or eternal family relationship. Sonship is the relation in which we are viewed as capable of sharing the divine thoughts and purposes. In this relation we are viewed as able to share with Christ the affections of the Father, and to respond to them. The *relation* of children corresponds and refers to us as we are down here, and in which we represent God in a moral way as partaking of His characteristics. We are *of* God.
A.E.M. Does that allow for development?
J.T. It does. There are several words used in the original for the word "children" in English; some diminutive and one covering the whole family, old and young.
A.E.M. I was going to ask if the way in which adoption is brought forward in Ephesians is to make room for the superior position of Christ in relation to it. Fatherhood in God and sonship in Christ were existing perfectly before we were brought into the family.
J.T. Christ is never viewed as a child in the sense in which we are children of God. In sonship He is spoken of as a child in a *physical* sense, "the child Jesus", but never in the sense in which the term applies to us spiritually. It is always sonship with Him; it is in Him that the *full* thought is seen. We are brought into what He had already inaugurated as a Son, that is as incarnate. We are *brought* into that, not *born* into it.
A.M.H. God having secured through birth what was entirely suitable to Himself and for Himself, adoption is added, to take us and place us in sonship in God's sight.
J.T. The same persons in another position. It is not bringing many *children* to glory, but *sons* to glory. The full family thought is that we are equal to entering into the divine counsels corresponding with the term "brethren of Christ".
H.H. Will the idea of the family be eternal, although
{87}
you say the thought of children applies to us down here?
J.T. The family thought goes through. The word "children" seems to be applied to us as derived of God generically, fitting in down here in the scene of adversity; we are according to His mind, the Spirit being the link, and witnessing with our spirit that we are children of God, so that we are *now* the children of God. Sonship for us properly refers to heaven, although we have received it and are sons; but really it is a faith state of things now, the Spirit, as the Spirit of adoption, making it a reality to us; but as to our actual condition now, we are not fully equal to it, hence it is said "we await adoption"; in other words, we await sonship, "that is, the redemption of our body (@Romans 8:23)". That is not said of us as children.
S.E.E. Is the equality of the two positions in our relation to the inheritance seen in the two passages, @Romans 8:17, "And if children, heirs also: heirs of God, and Christ's joint heirs; if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him", and @Galatians 4:7, "So thou art no longer bondman, but son; but if son, heir also through God".
J.T. These passages show that the two terms are equal in that sense. "Heirship" belongs to us in both relations.
Now to resume our subject, it is needful that we should revert to the second part of @Numbers 27, beginning at verse 12; having already enlarged on the daughters of Zelophehad, and what is conveyed in them spiritually, also Caleb's daughter and her husband; these showing the generative side, that is, those in the relation of children or seed. In Numbers the necessity for the new leader appears, as the "statute of right" is established, arising from the exercises of these women. We have the new leadership introduced immediately and by Jehovah Himself. Moses mentions it, but
{88}
Jehovah says to Moses, "Get thee up into this mount Abarim, and see the land that I have given unto the children of Israel. And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy peoples, as Aaron thy brother was gathered, because ye rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin, ... And Moses spoke to Jehovah, saying. Let Jehovah, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the assembly, who may go out before them, and who may come in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in, that the assembly of Jehovah be not as sheep that have no shepherd", @Numbers 27:12 - 17. We have the judicial pronouncement as to Moses again alluded to here that he should not go in because of rebellion against God's word. Others had been precluded for the same reason. They fell in the wilderness. Moses is to go up to die and to be buried by Jehovah Himself, according to another scripture, but he is wholly clear in his spirit. He is thoroughly with God as in the discipline, and suggests of himself that there should be another leader, and alludes to God's knowledge of the spirits of all flesh -- "Jehovah, the God of the spirits of all flesh,(@Numbers 27:16)" the God *of the spirits*. So that Joshua is evidently in Moses¬ mind as a spiritual leader. Moses¬ service was that of apostleship, or authority, but now it is a question of spirits, and so Jehovah speaks about Joshua, having the Spirit, not "another spirit", but "a man in whom is *the Spirit"(@Numbers 27:18)*.  So that I think we are coming here to the climax of the thought entering into our subject. Christ viewed in this way as having the Spirit. He is divine, of course, and gives the Spirit. Acts shows that He charged the apostles by the Spirit, @Acts 1:2. Indeed, He went about doing good in the power of the Spirit. We read about Him casting out demons by the Spirit of God. So that we have Christ in type here, Joshua being a man who had the Spirit, characteristically. It is he who is to lead the people into the inheritance.
{89}
L.D.M. Does the readiness of the children to enter the inheritance make way for leadership by the man in whom is the Spirit? I was thinking of the daughters of Zelophehad.
J.T. Yes. It is very significant that Jehovah in answer to Moses says, "Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit"(@Numbers 27:18). Moses had spoken to Jehovah, calling Him "the God of the spirits of all flesh,(@Numbers 27:16)" He would therefore know the spirit of Joshua; He would know the spirit of the one needed to lead; in fact. He was God over them. God Himself is a spirit. The Lord says to the woman of Samaria, "God is a spirit, and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and truth(@John 4:24)". Here He is the God of the spirits of all flesh, so that the matter is peculiarly spiritual now.
F.J.F. Does that show that leadership is dependent upon what God knows of the leader?
J.T. Just so. The whole matter now is between God and the leader who has the Spirit, and believers who are spiritual, for the daughters of Zelophehad had showed that they were spiritual, as also Achsah. So that entering into the inheritance implies *that the Spirit is here*. Those who form the assembly are basically, at least, spiritual, although Paul had to say that the Corinthians were not this *characteristically*, though their status was that. They were in Christ and the Holy Spirit was in them.
The book of Deuteronomy further develops our subject. Moses in the closing period of his life was able to say so much about it; as under discipline, not in spirit under it, but clear of it, yet it still attached to him in the government of God. Moses was not going into the land, but he is able to say much about what is there; and what is needed in those who go in. Hence it is thought well to suggest these Scriptures in Deuteronomy because the aim of the book is that we might go in *spiritually and suitably*. Moses merges, we may say,
{90}
in Joshua. It is a gradual matter, but finally they are both together at the door of the tent, and the Lord comes down and they are spoken to as together, and later, according to the last chapter, Moses dies, and Joshua is said to be filled "with the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands upon him; and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as Jehovah had commanded Moses". So that Moses merges, as it were, with Joshua. That is, they represent two features of Christ: the one authoritative, but more, because in Deuteronomy Moses¬ position borders on headship. It is what Moses says *himself*, and finally he emerges, as we said, in Joshua, who represents henceforth the leadership that is needed to take the people into the land.
J.D. "Because ye rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin, in the strife of the congregation", @Numbers 27:14. Would anything like that happen today to one who had been a leader?
J.T. Leaders may fall out of the ranks. We remarked yesterday that Moses had to suffer personally. He rises above all this, but nevertheless he has to suffer. So that we should take heed to ourselves. Disregard of the commandment of God on the one hand, and disrespect for the saints on the other, disqualifies a man for the leadership. That is what the apostle had in mind in the first letter to Corinth, and the second, too, "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment", @1 Corinthians 14:37. There were those at Corinth who were aiming at leadership, but were evidently disqualified. We know in the history of the testimony many have fallen out, who had a very definite place in the testimony, so that I believe the records of Moses¬ failure are to warn us. In Deuteronomy it is generally more that he suffered *vicariously*, that is, instead of the people; that in truth the state of the
{91}
people required the rebuke -- required that he should suffer. He says, "Jehovah was angry with me on your account" @Deuteronomy 1:37.
A.E.M. What is the position in relation to priesthood? Eleazar seems to be prominent in connection with Joshua, as though the two are linked up.
J.T. I think Eleazar represents the spiritual side of priesthood and hence qualified to be linked with Joshua, so that it is again two persons representing Christ, but spirituality stressed in both. Eleazar is said to be "the prince of princes of the Levites,(@Numbers 3:32)" a peculiar place he had even before his father died, but now he is in the true position of priesthood. I think, therefore, we have to look at Joshua and Eleazar together as entering into our subject. The priestly side is usually official, but in Eleazar it would take on what is peculiarly spiritual, not only authoritative. It says, "And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him, by the judgment of the Urim before Jehovah: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, he and all the children of Israel with him, even the whole assembly. And Moses did as Jehovah had commanded him; and he took Joshua and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before the whole assembly, and he laid his hands upon him, and gave him commandment, as Jehovah had said through Moses", @Numbers 27:21 - 23. The thought of the Urim is introduced. We are now in the presence of peculiar spirituality and stability. What a vista of glory and blessedness opens up as we see all this functioning in Christ, and our having part in it! Joshua is installed before Eleazar and the whole assembly here.
C.S.S. Would it work out as a result of obedience? When we get a man that is filled with the Spirit, it is said that they may "obey him", @Numbers 27:20.
J.T. Obedience and being helped by the Lord into the inheritance go together. In the antitype it is the
{92}
Spirit being the earnest of the inheritance that enables us to possess. We value the thought of the inheritance, as having already acquired spiritual instincts through the generative work of God, the Spirit taking all that up and developing sonship in us intelligently. We see how God Himself, for whom are all things and by whom are all things, is bringing many sons to glory, @Hebrews 2:10. And in doing so He has made the Captain of our salvation perfect through sufferings. That is, Christ has reached a point of perfection, meaning a *condition answering to the purpose of God;* and we, too, are brought into that condition, the relation of sonship attaching to it; and then in the acquirement of the purchased possession completed in the redemption of our bodies, we shall be in it as He is in it. So that divine Persons are all helping to bring us in. Hence the importance of what we had this morning of the intelligent desire to be there.
Ques. Is that the idea when Moses said, Jehovah "will go over before thee", and then of Joshua, "he shall go over before thee"?
J.T. And further, as we already noticed, Moses specifies that the new leader should go out before them, and come in before them, and lead them out and bring them in, all this having an answer in Christ as amongst His own. It is said in @Acts 1:21, that the needed apostle should be one who had assembled with the brethren "all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out amongst us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day in which he was taken up". His movements were spiritual movements. The two men at the ascension had this in mind: "This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall thus come in the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven", @Acts 1:11. It is a question of manner of movement, how the Lord went into heaven. He went up in their sight. So He was transfigured
{93}
*before them*. There are peculiar touches which were to react in the disciples. All this, as a type, enters into Joshua's position here, who would lead the people out and in. Moses says, "who may lead them out, and who may bring them in" -- *they must not be left outside*.
C.A.I. Does this not involve the intelligent apprehension of the mystery, and our being able to function intelligently in the body under the headship of Christ?
J.T. We are coming to that. Spirituality is essential to it. Of the spiritual man it is said, as already remarked, he himself is discerned of no one. Persons who are not spiritual are in a practical sense outside the range of the mystery.
L.D.M. Paul laid his glad tidings before those conspicuous at Jerusalem, as we see in @Galatians 2. Is that the recognition by them of his measure in spiritual things?
J.T. They gave him the right hand of fellowship. The apostles there were capable of discerning the grace given to him. Peter understood Paul. His closing words about him showed how thoroughly he understood the apostle Paul. Others did not. As to discernment, Paul gives a peculiar touch in @Acts 14. He looked on the man who was lame, and discerned that he had faith. He discerned that the man had faith to be healed, that is the power of discernment in a spiritual man. The lame man heard Paul *speaking*. Evidently he was affected by it -- that *kind* of speaking. Paul, on the other hand, discerned that he had faith, and so said to him with a loud voice, "Rise up straight upon thy feet",(@Acts 14:10) and he did so. He had never walked. The man represents the kind of material needed for the assembly The Lord says to Peter, "thou art Peter". Peter had in mind in his ministry to bring out that kind of material, so he calls the saints living stones and a spiritual house. Paul directs Timothy, in his second letter, to commit what he had heard of him in the presence of many
{94}
witnesses, to "faithful men", @2 Timothy 2:2. Timothy would thus be obligated to *find* them, to discern them. There is thus to be discernment in these administrative matters. The spiritual discerneth all things.
J.D. Would this be on Paul's mind after he had left Troas on the way up to Jerusalem? He sends for the elders of Ephesus and says that he has not shunned to declare to them the whole counsel of God. Would the continued service of God by the saints as entering into His counsel be on his mind?
J.T. The counsel of God came out in his service at Ephesus peculiarly. His letter to that assembly further confirms this. It was highly spiritual, and hence it begins with the inquiry, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit?" @Acts 19:2. A spiritual structure was in view. His enquiry was prophetic, that is, the work should take on great spiritual proportions; the assembly would grow into a holy temple in the Lord.
Now as regards Deuteronomy, in chapter 1 we have fine spiritual touches, first as to the distance to the land. "These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel", conveying spiritual thoughts, "on this side the Jordan, in the wilderness". Then we are told of the environment, and the names are given. "There are eleven days¬ journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea". There were evidently yet certain brotherly feelings in Edom. This book recognises them, but they were affected by rivalry. Then we are told that it was "in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all that Jehovah had given him in command to them; after he had smitten Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt in Ashtaroth and at Edrei". All this is spiritual, and it is affecting that a man of a hundred and nineteen years and eleven months should furnish us with such a book as this. Whatever
{95}
the discipline he had gone through, being prohibited from entering the land, he is now at the height of spiritual power and understanding. He is to see the land. He is to see it, as fully appreciating it, but not yet to enter it. *Dispensationally* he is representative of law and authority, and hence could not enter, but *personally* he is equal to it. He is able to accept the governmental dealing of God upon him. He knows at once that discipline and authority can never by themselves take the people of God into the land of Canaan. There is more than that needed. That is, we must apprehend Christ in the Joshua character; but we are told in effect here, and it is a spiritual touch, that you may get to Canaan in eleven days instead of forty years. It is for *us* to see how that could be.
C.S.S. Is the opening of this book in contrast to the opening of Leviticus?
J.T. Yes, the latter is approach to God, as in the tabernacle; the former is instruction for the land. We have the thought at the end of the passage read, that he had unfolded this law, that is, the opening up of what was in his mind. Moses began to unfold or expound to them. It is the spiritually instructive side rather than authority.
W.J.H. You base your reference to Paul travelling quickly to the line of the purpose of God, on the fact that in Damascus he preached that Jesus was the Son of God?
J.T. The Lord says to him, "why persecutest thou me?" @Acts 9:4. It was a spiritual word, involving the assembly, for the saints are alluded to as Himself. Paul would appreciate it later. It is a spiritual touch at the very outset, and then he immediately "preached Jesus that he is the Son of God (@Acts 9:20)".
I thought we might now look at the second passage read in chapter 1:35 - 38. The exclusion of the evil generation from the land is alluded to. Then it is said, "except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, he shall see it,
{96}
and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed Jehovah". And then, "Joshua the son of Nun, who standeth before thee, he shall go in thither; strengthen him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it". Caleb goes in and occupies the land that his feet trod on. Joshua goes in, too, but he goes in in order to cause the people to inherit; Jehovah says, "strengthen him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it". Christ has gone into heaven; He is there in order to cause us to inherit it. Moses then says, "I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that Jehovah your God hath done to these two kings: so will Jehovah do to all the kingdoms to which thou shalt go. Ye shall not fear them; for Jehovah your God, he will fight for you". @Deuteronomy 3:21. Stress is laid in this section on the destruction of Sihon and Og; they represent some great obstacle to our entering into the inheritance. It was after he had smitten Sihon and Og that Moses began to write the book of Deuteronomy. I think it is tantamount to saying, that we have to look to ourselves if we are to understand Deuteronomy; are these two kings really overthrown in the antitypical sense? They allude to our bigness according to our natural valuation of ourselves. So long as I retain a sense of my own importance, I am hindered, in fact I can hardly understand Deuteronomy. It is not a question of authority. So long as I am occupied with myself in any way, I need authority over me. In that sense I need Moses. Paul says, in effect. Shall I come unto you with the rod or in love? (@1 Corinthians 4:21). This great man Og has to go down. He seems to stand athwart the path of Israel into Canaan; but *Moses* overcame him. It is after that, we get Deuteronomy, and I believe it is to direct our view to this matter as to whether I have any personal motive as active in the things of God, any thought of personal prominence, to be big, something more than I am now.
{97}
If so, I shall never understand the book of Deuteronomy, nor enter Canaan in the history of my soul. These two men were overthrown, and Joshua is told that he would overcome all the others in the same way. The crucial point is to overcome these two men. "Thine eyes have seen all that Jehovah your God hath done to these two kings: so will Jehovah do to all the kingdoms to which thou shalt go (@Deuteronomy 3:21)".
H.W. Does that agree with the apostle Paul in connection with his intelligence in the mystery? He says, "To me, less than the least of all saints, has this grace been given", (@Ephesians 3:8).
J.T. That enters into the overthrow of these two kings. I have often wondered, and have spoken of it to others, how he could say that he was less than the least of all the saints, and yet he does, and significantly in the epistle to the Ephesians. It corresponds with the overthrow of Sihon and Og -- the latter shown in Deuteronomy to have been a very big man. If in the attitude of my soul I am less than the least of all the saints, I am able to respect the brethren.
W.J.H. The Psalm referring to the removal of these two men, Sihon and Og, says, "for his mercy endureth for ever", @Psalm 136:19,20.
J.H.F. Did Rahab enter into the spirit of this when she referred to these two men on the occasion when she spoke to the spies?
J.T. She did. She would see that the spies were not like these two men, they were *different*.
A.M.H. The first chapter speaks of God having gained these victories, and in the third chapter it is *we*. Does that correspond to Colossians -- to using the circumcision of Christ, first arriving at it in Christ in the soul and then mortifying our members?
J.T. Just so. That is the way to victory over them, mortifying the flesh. "Have your mind on the things that are above", (@Colossians 3:2). That is a great point as to
{98}
entering. We follow our minds, and then the passage says, "for ye have died, and your life is hid with the Christ in God (@Colossians 3:3)". When Christ comes out we shall appear with Him in glory. All these are great thoughts on the way to the inheritance; and then, "mortify therefore": that is the line of overcoming these two men, and of maintaining the victory in our souls.
Then going on to chapter 31 -- Moses now is saying, that he is a hundred and twenty years old. He says "I can no more go out and come in; and Jehovah hath said unto me. Thou shalt not go over this Jordan. Jehovah thy God, he will go over before thee, he will destroy these nations from before thee, that thou mayest take possession of them". Moses, although so old, continues in faith and spiritual power, and at the closing moment of his life he is able to write this remarkable song, Joshua associated with him, evidently, and he *completes* it. So that Moses now is completely identified with Joshua -- merges in him, you might say, so that as he dies, "Joshua the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands upon him; and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as Jehovah had commanded Moses". So that I think in these verses we are in the presence of Christ, as it were, disappearing *as in authority, but in full view as leading us into the spiritual inheritance of God for us*.
A.D. Do we get that in Solomon, when he asked God for wisdom that he might go out and come in and judge "a great people"?
J.T. Yes. David and Solomon are a continuation of Joshua in the types. Joshua is Christ bringing us in in spiritual power. It is, in a sense, a hidden matter, expressive of what goes on in the souls of the saints, but shown in their upward way and manner and service. David and Solomon take up the service of God which is linked with the book of Joshua.
{99}
Ques. Would you say that Joshua influenced the people rather than used authority?
J.T. That is the idea; the spiritual power needed peculiarly in the assembly; there we need also the wealth of inheritance. He brings us into that wealth, but then, as typified in David and Solomon, Christ orders the service of God, the praises of God. It is another side of our position.
H.D.T. So that what has been before us in spirituality would suggest a state capable of being influenced by what is in Christ.
J.T. That is what is so needed in assembly service. We thus discern the Lord, for instance, as He comes in a spiritual way. It is not His presence in a corporeal sense. He comes in a spiritual way and the spiritual understand, they know that He is there. They discern Him and say, "It is the Lord".
S.E.E. Would this form of spiritual leadership be expressed in Colossians 3:16: "Let the word of the Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another, in psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God"?
J.T. That is more general, not exactly assembly service, but links with the song before us. This song is ordered by God, and Joshua is evidently brought into it; Moses completed and spoke it to Israel. And then we have the blessing of the tribes in the next chapter. These two chapters furnish a magnificent finish to the book; we are introduced into the land, at least into the confines of the land. It is a matter of rich spiritual feelings, and calculated to promote joy and festivity. So that we are entering in gladness of soul into the divine territory. We are received there, too, as equal to it.
Ques. Do feelings according to God constitute substance?
J.T. They do. There is a certain richness in divinely
{100}
formed and developed feelings. One under control in the assembly knows what feelings there should be at a given time. Priestly intelligence in the believer enables him to know what to do in the assembly.
S.E.E. We are used to various forms of admonition -- does this in @Colossians 3 need to be taken account of more, "admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, spiritual songs"?
J.T. You are not likely to provoke resentment if you admonish in psalms, hymns and spiritual songs. It conveys good feeling, and yet it may convey the truth. We have had it elsewhere; singers in Israel such as Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman were prophets as well, so that prophecy may come to us in spiritual hymns. Many of our hymns are prophetic, bringing God to us.
E.S.W. Would it be right to say that the service of God in its highest sense can only be rightly taken up by persons who are in the enjoyment of the land? We can only serve as we have traversed the way you have indicated as following and being with Joshua; having spiritual substance formed in us?
J.T. I am sure that is right, so that worship in Deuteronomy is through the wealth that you acquire in the land; you bring the fruit in a basket. It is the wealth of the land that comes into the higher features of worship.
J.D. Would it connect with @2 Chronicles 5?
J.T. That is the full thought of it in the types.
Ques. Would the land represent the breaking of bread?
J.T. The breaking of bread is in the wilderness, but when Christ comes in we move on to the land. The land is where we are in association with Him.
J.W.H. In the last chapter we are told "the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as Jehovah had commanded Moses". Would that be the great result of what is cumulative in regard to the great thought of
{101}
spirituality, worked out as we are found together in the assembly?
J.T. Yes. The Lord takes up headship in the assembly, involving lead and influence rather than direct authority. *Authority is there*, however, so that we are as reverential at the end, in the family setting, as in the beginning in the dominical setting. We do not take any advantage of the Lord as coming to our side, taking His place with us as His brethren. We are always reverential.
{102}
GATHERING AND ATTRACTION
@John 11:49 - 53; @John 12:31 - 33; @John 10:1 - 16
My theme tonight is gathering and attraction, Christ being the Gatherer and also the Object who draws men and women to Himself by attraction. Attraction comes first in order historically, for it is found in the physical creation; gathering or shepherding is later, it awaited the creation of man. Abel represents the thought of gathering or shepherding, for he was a keeper of sheep, a man whose interests were in what was *living*. He is the prototype of all shepherds, and the occupation took definite and permanent form in the family of faith; the family of Abraham. It was abhorrent to the Egyptians; in the spiritual sense it belongs to those who have faith and love, the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.
I have in mind to speak of it as John presents it. He records this remarkable prophecy of Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year. Such a prophetic word from such a man is of peculiar*interest*, and suggests the importance of the prophetic word. God used the high priest of Israel at that time, not that there were not persons more suitable, but He would have testimony rendered to Christ by an exalted official among the Jews at that time. That God should use him reminds us of His sovereign ways, and also of the great value that attaches to the prophetic word and the consequent importance of being available for such a service. If we desire gifts, which we should, it is particularly that we should prophesy. God used Caiaphas, He used Balaam; showing how resourceful He is, that He uses whom He will according to His purpose.
However little Caiaphas understood his own words, we understand them, and the Spirit of God in recording
{103}
them moved on to speak of "the children of God". Perhaps Caiaphas never used this phrase, or scarcely understood the words; there is no evidence whatever that he was among the children of God. One may preach to others, or even prophesy; may convey the mind of God, and yet, as Paul says, himself "be rejected", @1 Corinthians 9:27. So the Spirit of God moves on to the children of God and says, "not for the nation only, but that he should also gather together into one the children of God who were scattered abroad", (verse 52). That verse has a peculiar relation to John's ministry, which God, as we have often said and heard, intended *for our times*. The effectuation of Caiaphas's prophecy is postponed; I mean the effect of it in the nation of Israel; the effect of the death of Christ in that nation will come about in its own time, for we are told that all Israel shall be saved -- all Israel, not every person known as a Jew, "for not all are Israel which are of Israel(@Romans 9:6)", but the whole nation of Israel shall be saved, but not until the fulness of the Gentiles, or the nations, has come in, @Romans 11: 25. We are in this category, a goodly number of us here, tonight, thank God. We are of "the fulness of the nations". As soon as it is completed God will have recourse to His ancient people, and the whole nation shall be saved -- born in a day, we are told elsewhere.
John, in keeping with his general line, introduces the thought of the children of God, but he regards them here (or the Spirit of God through him does so), as "scattered abroad". That thought would have touched, and was heavy upon, the heart of Christ, for He died that He should gather together into one the children of God that were scattered abroad. Doubtless we are all children of God, one would assume that we are, but some of us may be among the scattered ones. There are many in that sad case. It is sorrowful that any of the family of God should be scattered abroad. The Lord
{104}
had just been engaged with the family at Bethany. *They* were not scattered, they were each specifically known; known personally to Him, for He loved Martha and Mary and Lazarus -- He loved the three; they belonged to the family of God, they are representative of it, not as scattered, but as in family circumstances and relations: the Lord Himself being as it were their Head. There are those in this happy state at the present time; God has come in in a wonderful way, gathering His children. The application "children of God", is found in chapter 1 in a more happy and victorious setting, and each here will do well to compare the two scriptures, that in the first chapter and that in the eleventh chapter, and inquire in which setting *he* is. Those in the eleventh chapter are the children of God, but they are scattered. They have no certain dwelling-place, without a father, as it were, without a head -- scattered abroad. Nothing is said about *them*, as in such a position, having the right to take the place of children.
@John 1:12 speaks of those who receive Christ. I want you to notice what it says in that verse, "as many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God". That is another matter. That is what belongs to us normally, not only that we are regarded as the children of God, but we *value* the relationship, take it up and glory in it. They are not scattered abroad. The Spirit of God describes them for us, they are those who believe on the name of Jesus, they received Him when others rejected Him. The Lord said to the Jews, "I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not", (@John 5:43). It may be, there is one or more here who has not definitely received Christ. In His history of service here the time came of "his receiving up". How He moved in the light of this! But then there was the time of His reception *on earth*, and John tells us that those who received Him were given the right to be the children of God; to take their place as believing on His
{105}
name, and then we are told that *they were born* -- the family thought is added to their position as being the children of God, being born, as we are told, not "of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God (@John 1:13)". That is normal Christianity; it involves house conditions, and the affections belonging to the family.
The other passage (@John 11:52) implies persons who have left that, those who, although retaining their generative relations to God, are *scattered*. They belong to the family, but they are not in the circumstances of the family, and so we have this thought that Jesus died in order that they should be gathered together into one, no longer so many units, but "into one". That is into the oneness of love, or, in other words, into the oneness of life, which tends to produce the oneness of love; that is John's line, and life is the expression of love. Why should any of us be among the *scattered* , Christ having died in order that we might be *gathered*?
It is the gathering time now. I shall speak in a moment about attraction, but I want to stress now that it is the gathering time, and also that there are not wanting those who are shepherds. As I have been saying, the shepherds belong to the family of faith. You will recall how Joseph tutored his brethren as to what they should say to Pharaoh. Pharaoh says to them, "What is your occupation?(@Genesis 47:3)" but Joseph anticipated this inquiry of the monarch. It was an occupation in reproach in Egypt. It could not be much in reproach in the mind of Pharaoh, for he himself had cattle and needed shepherds to look after them, so that in this respect he was not characteristically an Egyptian. We may look for such in our exercises as under reproach; where we least expect it we may find what corresponds to us as of God. So Joseph had carefully primed his brethren to say to Pharaoh, "Thy servants are men that have been occupied with cattle from our youth even until now, both we and our fathers", @Genesis 46:34. Let us not be
{106}
ashamed of that occupation, for it is an honourable one. It is really persons occupied with live stock, typically *living people;* and so Abel stands over against Cain. Cain was occupied with purely material things -- machinery and the like, building cities, which would lead to honouring the god of forces, @Daniel 11:38. Faith is engaged with living persons. Our eternal occupation will be with persons, not with machinery and the like. So that as Pharaoh inquired of the five that Joseph selected to take to him, they said, "Thy servants are shepherds (@Genesis 47:3)". One of the gifts of Christ was "shepherds and teachers", in one person -- a most valuable brother! Teaching may give one more prominence, it is seen on the platform, and requires more grace to keep small. The shepherd services are often unseen by others, requiring self-abnegation, and toil, as with the Lord Himself *going into the mountains* for the lost sheep. Hence the importance of the ability of a shepherd. It is a question of life from John's point of view. "Children of God" is a generative thought, and there are many of our brethren having a link with God in that sense, and yet having no family circle. Dear brethren, let us take that word into our hearts, *a family circle where affection is*. God has provided it at the present time. It is a question first of our relation with Him through His generative power. He has brought it about Himself, "the children of God".
Some of you perhaps have not followed up the abstract thought involved in this; the natural instinctive promptings of your heart have been toward worldliness, earthly-mindedness it may be, but yet you retain the holy seed as being born of God. It is a question of life, and so in chapter 10 the Lord refers to Himself as Shepherd -- and that is, in the main, the instruction for this evening, that He is "the shepherd of the sheep". Only One could say that. One might be a shepherd or an under-shepherd, but only One could say that He
{107}
was *the* Shepherd of the sheep. He is known as One who comes in by the door, who takes the regular way, not a clandestine way, which is that of the thief and the robber. Christ is "the shepherd of the sheep". And then He goes on to say, that He is "the door of the sheep", and then again that He is "the good shepherd" who "lays down his life for the sheep". He has come "that they might have life", Jesus says, "and ... might have it abundantly", and again He says, "I am the good shepherd; and I know those that are mine, ... as the Father knows me and I know the Father". Think of *that kind of knowledge*. It belongs to life. It is a question of life. The sheep are viewed in that way. They hear not the voice of a stranger -- they know the voice of Christ and follow Him. This is all abstract.
You may say, I know but little about that. Well, go back in your history and remember the occasions in which you definitely desired to take a firm stand for the Shepherd, to follow Jesus, but other things came in and drowned the feeling, but the *feeling in itself was perfect:* that is what I refer to in using the word abstract. The Lord never forgets that time when there was an instinctive movement in your soul to be a follower of His, but you have allowed it to be overwhelmed by worldliness, earthly-mindedness, or some other interest. The desire, however, was perfect, and the Lord would bring you back to this, as one of His sheep. I am speaking now, as I said, of what is abstract. We can never understand this passage and other passages in John, save as we understand the abstract side. It is not always abstract, for as I have said, now and again this longing comes up in worldly Christians, but they stifle it, they allow it to be quenched. Government is sometimes in bad men, yet you get it *in the abstract*. Pilate, for instance, knew that Jesus was innocent. His wife told him that she suffered much on account of Him, and he was minded to release Him. Abstractly he
{108}
was right, but he came under adverse influences and fell, and delivered up Jesus to be crucified. In like circumstances, then, we must go back to the abstract and work it out, ceasing to stifle it. It is perfect in itself, hence let it develop. Christians viewed as sheep have their own characteristics. They are true in their instincts, but these are often stifled. I speak of this in a practical way, for many stifle innate feelings and lose in their own souls.
Now the Shepherd is always knocking at your door, as He is tonight, I am persuaded. He is the good Shepherd of the sheep. There is no other. Do you yield to Him? Do you acknowledge Him? Has His voice a charm? He said, "I am the door". If there is a movement with you at all to get into the realm of righteousness, the word from the Lord to you is, "I am the door: if any one enter in by me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and shall go out and shall find pasture", @John 10:9. Thus you will have holy liberty. You have not got it now, if you are allowing these holy instincts of life to be stifled in your soul by worldliness. The Lord is waiting, knocking at your door, and saying to you, "I am the door of the sheep". How we love to bring out what He is to us, "the shepherd of the sheep", "the door of the sheep", and then, "the door" (an outstanding thought) "if any one enter in by me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and shall go out and shall find pasture". Many of us understand that. We have come into liberty because we have allowed our instincts their place. We have developed and fed them. We have come to own Jesus as the door of the sheep, the door by which if anyone enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out and find pasture -- a very full statement of the Shepherd's service. Then the Lord tells us that He laid down His life for us. It is an overwhelming thought, following upon the others, as you let it into your soul. He laid down His life for
{109}
the sheep, and then again He says in effect, I know them and they know Me.
What I have been saying is all abstract as regards the sheep; you *begin* with that. The time was when you did know something of Christ. He took note of that. It is included in what is said here, "I ... am known of those that are mine", but He is dealing with the full thought in an abstract sense, saying, that His sheep know Him as the Father knows Him and He knows the Father. Think of the circle open to us, dear brethren, in the sense of knowledge, *the kind of knowledge*. There is the kind of *love* that the Father has for the Son, but there is the kind of *knowledge* that exists between the Father and the Son, and the sheep are admitted into that. Is it not attractive? But I am not at this moment speaking of attraction, but rather of what the Shepherd does. He goes on to say. He "brings" the sheep, not attracts them exactly, but He brings them. That is to say, the Shepherd goes to where you are and brings you. And He says there are "other sheep". He had been speaking of the Jewish sheep; He had gone into the fold and put them forth, so that they followed. That was His service to them, added to the great fact that He laid down His life for them. He opened up the way for them to come out of the Jewish fold, and then He brings the other sheep that He had, and constitutes them all one flock. Not one flock by themselves, but both classes forming one flock and having one Shepherd.
So, dear brethren, I think you will agree to what I have said, and see from the Scriptures I have read that the Lord is serving in this wonderful way. It is a matter of life, and a matter of generation, too, and I may say that generation is greater than creation. Adam was created, of course, but also generated. He was *of God*, God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Adam became a living soul. That is how he became
{110}
a living soul. He became it by the breath of God. So that we have the two thoughts. As "the children of God" we are of the family; this refers to generation, and gives us a status above creation. We are, of course, creatures, but then we are *born of God*, but how sorrowful, as born of God, that any of us should be unattached! Are there not here some who are unattached, having no association of holy spiritual affection? The Lord died in order that He might have you with the brethren, and with them as one, not simply as so many persons, but gathered "together into one", a remarkable suggestion of unity; but what affection enters into it, what warmth! There may be some here, as I said, who are unattached, let me appeal to you. The Lord died that you should be attached to Him, as Head, and attached to His brethren in the power of the Spirit, and that in a practical sense. It is a matter of *oneness*, oneness in life, the evidence of which is love. That is what I had to say about gathering.
Now *attraction* is concurrent with what I have been saying. The Lord says, "Now is the judgment of this world". It was immediately the Jewish world, but in principle it applies generally, and He would draw all unto Him as lifted up from the earth. Think of the ignominy involved in that statement, for He spoke this "signifying by what death he was about to die"! I have been speaking of His laying down His life, that was an action of His own; no one could take it from Him, but in this passage He was speaking of being lifted up *by men*. Three times in this gospel He is said to be lifted up, but this time, as lifted up. He would draw all unto Him. It is a question of attraction, concurrent with His shepherdly service -- there is this magnetism that is in Christ: His personal attractiveness.
To illustrate it, I refer briefly to Noah: as *in the ark*, he is presented as attractive. The animals are not said to go to him until he is in the ark and not only
{111}
in the ark, but in the ark *family-wise*. My two points thus run together, embracing the family thought. Christ is more attractive, if I may make comparison, as He is apprehended in the family, in the radiation of love from Him to the saints and from the saints to Him. He is more attractive there than elsewhere, and that is what Noah presents. He went into the ark and his wife and his three sons and their wives: eight of them; and then the creatures "came two and two unto Noah into the ark (@Genesis 7:9)". That is the feature I commend to you. If you apprehend Christ personally, as does the bride in the Song of Solomon, then think of Him in the radiation of affection as seen in that book. She spoke of Him according to His personal attractiveness and beauty: but there is in that book the radiation of affection and that is most felicitous in the things of God. The nearer you get to the Lord the more you find the presence of that kind of love. So that the animals, two by two, went *unto Noah*, not simply into the ark. They went to *him* in the ark, that is the point.
The Lord has brought about, in these last days, such conditions that Christ is known family-wise. Even straying ones, as in the end of this gospel -- persons who went off fishing, seven of them -- He called children, an appeal being thus made to their family instincts, and every one born of God has these instincts, if they would only allow the assertion of them. It enters into the salvation of souls, to admit the exercise of family feelings. Do not drown them. Let them have full play, and if you do, you will look for other Christians. You will find out where they live and seek them out, and life will begin to radiate between you and them and you will say, as gathered together with them. This is *my* place, I am at home here. One knows of instances of this kind -- the Lord in the passage I read in @John 12, says, "I, if I be lifted up", that is, lifted up *alone* -- none of us was lifted up with Him. He bore the ignominy
{112}
alone, and He said this signifying what death He should die. It was the death of the cross. The shameful death of the cross! But He is so certain of the attraction that is in Him, that He says, "I ... will draw all to me". There is no doubt about it. There is correspondence in those drawn, and hence the work of God in them is implied. Elsewhere He says, "No one can come to me except the Father who has sent me draw him (@John 6:44)". There are many that need to be reminded of this. You are ashamed of Him. You are ashamed of the cross, but He is confident that in time the work of God will assert itself and you will come to Him in spite of the shame, bearing His reproach. It is your privilege. May God bless these things to all of us.
{113}
THE TEMPLE OF GOD AND THE SCRIPTURES
@John 2:18 - 22; @John 5:46,47; @John 10:35; @Revelation 3:12
This service will take the character of remarks (I hope, in the power of the Spirit) on the Holy Scriptures and on the Temple of God. These are two prime subjects, important at all times, but particularly in our own. I selected John's writings only, as they have peculiarly in view the last days. It will be remembered by most of us that it is recorded in the last chapter of the gospel of John that John was following Jesus, and Peter inquired of the Lord, "what shall this man do?(@John 21:21)" Evidently John was an unimposing, markedly unambitious brother who valued love more than most things. The Lord in replying to Peter said, "If I will that he abide until I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou me", (@John 21:22). The Lord, although not meaning that John should remain alive until He came, certainly meant to connect Peter's mind with the period of His coming, and that, as it approached, provision would be made for the peculiar conditions that should arise. So it is that the bearing of John's ministry is toward our days, for which, those of us who have understood this and proved it, thank God continually. John, therefore, among other things, stresses *the Scriptures*, but also stresses the *Temple of God*, connecting it, in our first scripture, with the body of Christ here; and in @Revelation 21 with Christ as the Lamb in the holy city. He says, "I saw no temple in it; for the Lord God Almighty is its temple, and the Lamb (@Revelation 21:22)". The conditions in the city are suited to the divine presence, yet the idea of the temple is there, and divine Persons are said to be in it; implying that They are very accessible. The Lamb will
{114}
certainly be accessible, and God in Him; so that inquiry will be made then in the temple.
I purpose to speak about the Scriptures first. They are peculiarly the object of the enemy's attack at the present time; for many years past, indeed, they have been the subject of attack continuously; for, although a certain body of professing Christians of great antiquity and renown, assumes to recognise them *in toto*, yet they are largely nullified by its interpretations - as effective a way as there is of rendering them ineffective as read by men.
In the period of the Reformation, as many of us will know, the authority of scripture was asserted. This was met by the body, to which I allude, some years later, by spurious additions to the Scriptures, beclouding them and dragging them down, to say the least, to the level of mere human productions; the Apocrypha was added to the canon of scripture. Then again in regard to the temple of God, God graciously, in later years, revived the thought of it. The truth recovered included what Paul conveyed in his question to the Corinthians, "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?" @1 Corinthians 3:16. Light from the temple was thrown on the holy page of scripture and the true canon of scripture was discerned and preserved, and has been maintained to the present moment, and will be, by the help of God, to the end: the Spirit being here. This great revival of the truth, so far-reaching, so illuminating, so practical, entering into the various meetings of the saints for the study of scripture and for ministry, is discounted by the same religious body in what it calls *The Bull of Infallibility*, in which a mere man, under certain conditions, is regarded as competent to speak with divine authority. Antichrist, we are told in the Scriptures, "sits down in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God", @2 Thessalonians 2:4.
{115}
I mention these facts, dear brethren, because we should know them. They belong to the working of evil against the Scriptures,, against the Holy Spirit, an against the temple of God. It is well to have them in mind, because God is looking for faithfulness amongst us, that the authority of scripture may be maintained inviolate, and that the presence of the Holy Spirit, as constituting saints in whom He dwells, the temple of God, should be maintained not only in terms, but in practice, so that we need not speculate on what any part of scripture means. No honest Christian would say that he understands all scripture, but, in dependence on God, as the brethren assemble together in the light of the temple, the Holy Spirit sheds light on the holy page of scripture, so that we understand. Many of us have been gladdened as on such occasions light broke in, the Spirit of God inn His own way, sometimes quit unexpectedly, making a passage luminous in a fresh way. A peculiar joy enters into the heart of a servant when he has such an experience. The blessed Spirit of God moving, acting in the temple, causing light to shine in, gladdens, perhaps, not only the one whom He used, but all who heard. If there are those here who regard what I am saying as unintelligible, I would urge you to look into the matter and consider the significance, as seen in scripture, of the temple of God.
There are two words used for temple in the New Testament, both appearing in @John 2:14,19, the former referring to the general building called the temple, the latter to the inner sanctuary, and is the word used throughout the book of Revelation. It refers to the immediate presence of God, where also He makes communications, as in @Numbers 7:89. Think of the greatness of it! The Psalmist says, "to inquire in his temple (@Psalm 27:4)". It may be there are those here who have never thought of it, but the temple of God is one of the most important facts of the moment. It is parallel
{116}
with the Scriptures in importance. It is in virtue of the temple that the canon of scripture has been determined. Whatever may be said of ecclesiastical councils and their findings, it is in the power of the Spirit that the saints determine what is of God; what is authoritative as from Him. They, as of the temple, discern it, and regard as spurious, however canonised, what has no part in the Holy Scriptures.
I want first to speak of the Scriptures before continuing about the temple. You will see how the two thoughts as to the temple are linked in my first passage -- @John 2; first, the temple in the general sense, out of which the oxen, etc., were cast; and then the Lord speaks of the temple of His body; and, as to the latter, John says, that after He rose from among the dead. His disciples "believed the scripture". We have a suggestion here of the importance of the light of resurrection in relation to scripture. They believed the scripture. Many of us here, it may be, believe because we have been born into Christian households. We have regarded the Scriptures according to their face value, theoretically perhaps, scarcely reading them much. Presently some school teacher tells you that the book of Genesis is doubtful, and the book of Jonah a fanciful story, and you partly believe it. In thousands of cases this has happened. Hence the importance of looking into the great matter of the resurrection. John says, on more than one occasion, this included, that the truth of the resurrection and glory of Christ bears on the authority of scripture. In truth it is as apprehending by the Spirit, Christ risen and indeed glorified, that we get the full bearing of scripture. The Bible becomes a new book to us. It is lighted up with the glory of Christ. Hence here the disciples after Christ arose "believed the scripture" -- it is put first, and after that "the word which Jesus had said". The word which Jesus had said, as I hope to show presently, implies the temple.
{117}
The body of Christ was the temple. It was the temple while He was alive, and here in the flesh, but now His word is believed. He raised Himself, and the light of His resurrection enabled the disciples to believe what Jesus said as well as the Scriptures. Hence, as believing the Scriptures, on this principle, they become peculiarly interesting. A living thought enters your soul, the resurrection of Christ is a wonderful fact in the soul. One of the most remarkable things is that after He arose He expounded to two wandering saints in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself -- Himself in that condition. Of course they refer to Him in flesh and blood, but now He is in a new condition, and so the effect of resurrection in the soul enables one to read the Scriptures in a new way. They are *Appointed to be read in churches* -- thank God! especially in England; but how read? The Lord says to one, "how readest thou?" And again an honest man, the Ethiopian eunuch, in answer to Philip's question, "Understandest thou what thou readest?" says, "How can I, except some man should guide me?(@Acts 8:30,31)" That is the attitude of soul to take, and hence I lay stress on the word read in @John 2, "they believed the scripture".
This is the first point; the second point I would make is the *exposition* of the Scriptures. "He expounded unto them", we are told by Luke (@Luke 24:27). God furnishes expositions, and He would urge us to use them, to avail ourselves of them; the Lord led the way into it; "he expounded unto them in all the scriptures"(@Luke 24:27) -- what an unfolding! How one would love to hear how He touched on the different books of the Old Testament! He never touched on the Apocrypha, you may be sure. Philip again in answer to the eunuch, preached unto *him Jesus*, beginning at the scripture the eunuch was reading. I cannot say that he was reading the prophet Isaiah right through; but undoubtedly it was under the guidance of the Lord that he was reading that particular
{118}
chapter; and it was under the direction of the Lord that Philip was there to help him to understand; and so it is the Lord provides expositions of scripture. Why not avail ourselves of them prayerfully? One could list some of them, but I would certainly urge the use of divinely furnished expositions. They are of God, and to neglect them is loss. Do not allow them to replace the Scriptures, read the scripture first and then the exposition.
Then again, I would say. Search the Scriptures. That is what the Lord says in John, "Search the scriptures". We may do so, as for hidden treasure, and we will not fail to find it. The Lord says, "in them ye think ye have eternal life"(@John 5:39). You will find eternal life spoken of in the Scriptures, but you will not find the substance in the Scriptures, you will have to go to Christ for that. Eternal life is in Christ, but the Scriptures aid you in the *understanding* of it. He says, "ye think that in them ye have life eternal, and they it is which bear witness concerning me", @John 5:39; and again, "ye will not come to me that ye might have life", @John 5:40. Many pore over the Scriptures in that way instead of linking the reading of them with Christ; He is the substance of all scripture, the spirit of all scripture. Then again, the Lord says "the scripture cannot be broken" -- a very great thought. What a word, dear brethren, at the present time, when men are so boldly, blasphemously, suggesting that Christ told lies. He makes much of Moses. He says, "if ye do not believe his writings", @John 5:47. Think of the Lord putting the writings of Moses before His own words! Yet men would make some of Moses¬ writings fictitious. The Lord says, "if ye do not believe his writings, how shall ye believe my words?" (@John 5:47) I am speaking so that we might be fortified. Times are getting worse and worse, and God would have us fortified on these points. "The scripture", said the Lord, "cannot be broken", @John 10:35.
{119}
Many of you will remember the connection. They thought the Lord was blaspheming because He said He was the Son of God, and He said, "Is it not written in your law, I said. Ye are gods?" (@John 10:34) and, in this connection, the Lord says that the scripture cannot be broken. Let us accept it. Well, says the Lord, if those to whom the word of God came are thus spoken of, "do ye say of him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world. Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am Son of God?"(@John 10:36) I speak thus, as I said, that we might be fortified, that our feet may be on solid ground in accord with the Scriptures. *They cannot be broken*, the Lord says, and anyone who attempts to break them is taking direct issue with Christ. He will do well to remember that he is not stronger than the Lord.
Well now, in the few minutes that are left I wanted to return to the temple. I have connected it with John's writings, because he uses the word more than any of the evangelists, quite a number of times in the book of Revelation. I quoted one in chapter 21, where the thought is connected, as I said, with the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb. "I saw no temple in it; for the Lord God Almighty is its temple, and the Lamb (@Revelation 21:22)". So that it is connected with divine Persons, and hence in our scripture in @John 2, the Lord refers to His body as the temple. As He was here in the flesh, how approachable He was! Yet in His answers He was concerned about the divine thought governing the question, and on the other hand, the state of the questioner. Now He is risen and in heaven, and will function as the temple in the heavenly city presently; in the meantime the temple is here in the saints. Let no one be afraid of that remark as to the saints, but here it is the saints viewed *organically*. Some of you may be quite out of contact with this thought of an organism and, of course, you are losing enormously. It is the time to learn how to function in the organism called "the mystery of God;
{120}
in which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge", (@Colossians 2:3). They are *hidden* there. The hiding implies spirituality in the saints, for the saints are viewed, in the Scriptures, in a mysterious sense, as possessing the Spirit; and viewed thus, they have in them, deposited by the Spirit, all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. Can any Christian assume to get along without this wonderful thing -- the mystery of God? It is God's thought for each Christian, that you should have part in it, and so the apostle says to Christians not very far advanced -- those at Corinth -- "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? ... for the temple o God is holy?" @1 Corinthians 3:16,17.
We need not, as I said before, be speculating if a thing is not clear to us in the Scriptures. The Lord would have us to have recourse to the temple, and at the same time to have *patience*. "If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God (@1 Peter 4:11)". That would preclude speculative and fanciful thoughts. I need not be fanciful, I am not strengthened by it, I am not helped by it, nor are my hearers. I should have recourse to the temple; the matter may not be made clear at once, but I may go again, and again, and again; presently, as I have said, light breaks through. I am able to revise my article in dependence on the Lord. I am able to take my stand as responsible for its contents; if I do not, I should not publish it. The temple meets it all. We are wonderfully furnished, dear brethren, and the Lord would bring this to us, "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?" (@1 Corinthians 3:16) What is it for? For inquiry. It is much safer to inquire there than from any brother; not that we should not inquire from one another; I am not disparaging that -- but the temple, the Spirit being in it, is the supreme thought in this matter, and God would have it honoured. Hence we find in the most complicated
{121}
period seen in scripture, in the book of Revelation, the temple is more referred to, and actually used, than in any other book.
What a complicated state of things is now coming in? What darkness in varied forms of apostasy is spreading abroad rapidly! How essential that the temple should have its place! John shows us that it is to have its place in the conditions depicted in the book of Revelation; hence I have read the passage that relates directly to our own times, to this meeting tonight: @Revelation 3:12. The Lord refers to it in speaking to Philadelphia; He assumes that the overcomer in that assembly understands the temple. We may assume that that brother had been ministering; had given addresses, and sought to expound scripture. How could he be sure of the truth of what he ministered? By the temple. The Spirit of God is speaking, according to these addresses, to the assemblies; the temple is involved in this, and the overcomer in Philadelphia understands. The Lord says, "him will I make a pillar in the temple of my God", @Revelation 3:12. The Lord was the *temple itself* -- only *He* could be that. Now He will make the overcomer a *pillar* in the temple of God. Why does He say that? Because the overcomer would understand and value the great honour of being a pillar *there*. How shall I be a pillar there, if I have not been a pillar here? It is *here* that I am to stand up for the truth, and the assembly is "the pillar and base of the truth (@1 Timothy 3:15)". It is possible and most important that the minister should understand, should be assured as serving the saints, that what he is saying is according to God. It is possible for him to speak "as the oracles of God (@1 Peter 4:11)". Thus he values what the Lord proposes to him, to make him a pillar in the temple of His God. That would be a *support* to it, and an *adornment* to it.
Dear brethren, that is the need *now* -- support and adornment of what is of God. We often speak of these
{122}
things, and rightly, in our Bible readings; but then what about certainty as to what we are saying? What about assurance that it is the mind of God, that you can subscribe your name to notes of it, depending on the Lord? "In many things", says James, "we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man", @James 3:2. Mistakes are made, but I am speaking of the possibility, in a general way, of speaking the word of God, and knowing that it *is* the word of God. The saints need to be assured, and the minister needs to stand by what he says and writes, assured that it is in its general substance and bearing the word of God. He can do so in virtue of the temple. It is in part the Lord's answer to modernism. It is a wonderful thing, that the Spirit of God is actually speaking today, the temple of God running concurrently with the authority of scripture; so that the Scriptures are understood and can be applied in a spiritual way. It is a great triumph, and the Lord would have us to enlarge on it, to understand how to inquire in the temple of God. There are two things as to the house of God that the Psalmist -- indeed David himself -- stresses: "to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple (@Psalm 27:4)". He says, "One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his temple". (@Psalm 27:4). The soul is to be entranced by that -- "the beauty of the Lord", the wonderful divine traits that are delineated for us in the house: it is a question of the place of the affections. Then there is more, namely, to "*inquire in his temple"*. It is quite right to take the concordance, and read the Bible carefully and studiously; but do not forget to inquire of the Lord in His temple. Read in your own room, of course, but the light usually comes in more freely and fully as one is in the attitude of inquiry when the saints are together as in the temple. Let us accept it as a fact. It *is*
{123}
a fact, and many of us have proved it. Let us prove it *more*. We have only touched the fringe of this great truth. It is God's way of meeting modernism, and al that is like it at the present time. The incorruptibleness of the Scriptures, the spirituality of the Scriptures, and their applicability to all circumstances are lighted up by the Spirit in the temple. There is a great door opened up to the dear brethren, and one is urging it, on oneself and on all, to make much of this side of the truth -- the temple of God. We have not far to go to seek it. "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God", says the apostle, "and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? (@1 Corinthians 3:16)" As we come together humbly and simply, in recognition of these things, the light shines around us -- what Christ is to God, and the way by which Christ effects all His thoughts. All these things come out when we inquire in this way, in His temple. May God bless the word!

IDENTIFICATION IN GOD'S WORLD
@Revelation 7:9 - 15 (first clause), @Revelation 14:1 - 3, @Revelation 20:4
What is in mind at this time is to speak about identification in God's world. These scriptures furnish a basis, a three-fold testimony to the point in mind. The book is indeed marked by testimony to the certainty that believers in Christ shall be identified in that world. The Lord Jesus Himself spoke of "that world and the resurrection (@Luke 20:35)". He said that those who share in it neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels, @Luke 20:36; they are the sons of God, being sons, as He says, of the resurrection. This instruction in no way precludes the idea of identification of those who belong to Christ in "that world".
What I hope to show is that they will be identified by certain moral features that marked them in this world in the days of their responsibility, but taking on a permanent form in a spiritual sense, still carrying the identification of the persons with it. The Lord says to His disciples, as they gloried in speaking to Him of the power that wrought in them through the ministry, "in this rejoice not, ... but rejoice that *your names are written in the heavens"*, (@Luke 10:20). He mentions only their names. The epistle to the Hebrews speaks of "the assembly of the firstborn *who are registered in heaven"*, @Hebrews 12:33. Again the allusion is to a register of names, as we may say, a *Who is who* book in heaven. *Each will answer to his name, and have his own distinguishing feature in life, and not only in life, but in family dignity, for each is a firstborn*. This could only be said of the divine family. In no other family is every member a firstborn. *Hence, dear brethren, our family status above is mutually equal*.
What I have in mind now is not the family status,
{125}
but the moral features that mark the children of God here in the sphere of responsibility, carried forward into the day of glory, for we read of "the liberty of the glory of the children of God", (@Romans 8:21). I propose to speak of them, of their traits, in classes. *It is a question of the class to which each here may belong. As children of God, and as sons of God, we are all of the same family, but from the moral side there are classifications, and these classifications arise from what each has been in the sphere of his responsibility*. To what class do I belong? To illustrate what I am saying, the apostle Paul speaks of certain who "shall be saved, but so as through the fire", (@1 Corinthians 3:15). They will be a class in a sense -- not one to aspire to, certainly, although everyone so saved is a testimony to God's sovereign mercy, and the saving value of the blood of Jesus. It is pitiable, however, that one shall appear in that world in that class, for he has no works to glorify him there -- they are all burnt up. *His building in the structure of God professedly is of no value at all*, on the contrary, wood, hay, stubble, only fit to be removed, or destroyed by fire; but as heaven claims him eternally, there is no change as to the person himself in that: "*he* shall be saved, but so as through the fire (@1 Corinthians 3:15)". We read in this book of Revelation of those who die in the Lord after a certain time. "Blessed the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth. Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; for their works follow with them", @Revelation 14:13. They are not saved so as through fire, their works *stand*.
Now, these are the ones that I have in mind as a class, and in what I am saying no doubt the dear brethren will not be passing the thoughts on to others, but each, including the speaker, taking them to himself *so as to understand where one is in the divine classifications in God's world*. As I said, there can be no question about us as to our family status, even the one whose works are burnt up has that; but in the clearance account --
{126}
that is, on entry into "that world" there must be a clearing of accounts -- this matter of works must arise. So the elder in our first scripture is of a class well versed in the works of God through His people - for indeed, eldership is made to depend on moral qualifications -- they are a class by themselves, the twenty-four elders. One would greatly desire to be amongst them, I mean from the moral side; it is not a question of the family side, as I understand it. *These elders are conversant with the whole testimony of God, and consequently they are qualified for their service*. They sit round the throne in this book; they have thrones; they have crowns; *they know what to say; they know what to do and when to do it*.
You can understand the pleasure in the mind of this elder as he looks at the vast multitude of the redeemed that no one can number. He cannot, as it were, let the opportunity pass of calling attention to them, and so it will be in God's world. God loves to call attention to the fruit of His own works, at the same time accrediting those to whom He calls attention; even as the Lord Jesus in the house of Simon the Pharisee says to Simon, "Seest thou this woman?" (@Luke 7:44). What pleasure He had in calling attention to her? Then again, Mary of Bethany, as she was censured by Judas, the Lord says, "Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this", (@John 12:7). The clearing period in that world will be full of such remarks. It is well to face it, as to what will be said of each of us. *Under what head will each be classified? It is in our hands now to determine*. Divine counsel, of course, determines the place of each in the family. All the saints are being brought to glory and each will have his distinction and place, the brethren of Christ too, the members of the body also -- the organism. It is not left to each to determine his place there. It is a question of infinite wisdom. Only divine skill could devise such a thing as the assembly viewed as an organism: it is the masterpiece of God in
{127}
creation; it is all His own work, but then, from the moral side, as related to the judgment seat of Christ, it is in our hands as to what class we are in.
The elder, in chapter 7, representing the divine side worked out in man, says to John. "What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?" A double question -- "What are these? ... and whence came they?" We have identification of persons and, as you might say, their localities. Hence, "what?" or "who?" and "whence?" "Whence came they?" The elder has much in mind; he does not say all that he could say about them. The Spirit of God had already said of them that they were "standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palm branches in their hands. And they cry with a loud voice, saying. Salvation to our God who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb", verses 9, 10. The Holy Spirit tells us that, but the elder does not say everything. He says enough. The Lord could have said much more about Mary of Bethany than He said, and much more about the woman in Simon's house, but He said enough for His purpose. So here the elder says, "What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?" Why did John not ask about this wonderful company? The elder calls his attention to them -- at least he calls his attention to them so as to bring out who they were and whence they came. That is an appealing matter, and, dear brethren, when heaven calls out, whoever may do it in that day, what shall we have that can be mentioned? It may be that there are those here of whom it can hardly be said that they "have washed their robes, and have made them white". These people went the whole way in their appropriation of the blood of Christ, and they had palms, we are told: "palm branches in their hands. And they cry with a loud voice, saying. Salvation to our God who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb". They would not
{128}
accredit anything to themselves, but heaven accredits them. They are ascribing salvation to God, for in truth, that is how the matter stands, but yet there is the idea of saving ourselves, as Peter says, "Save yourselves from this untoward (or perverse) generation", (@Acts 2:40). If anyone here is in any association marked by perverseness, save yourself from it. It is in your hands to do it. God alone can save you from eternal ruin, but it is in your hands, the Spirit working in you, to save yourself from a perverse generation, and moreover to work out your own salvation. Not exactly your salvation from eternal ruin, but your present salvation, from the world and from the power of Satan too, to *work it out*. "It is God", says the apostle, "which worketh in you", (@Philippians 2:13), *but the working out is your matter*.
These have used the blood of the Lamb as available to wash their robes and make them white. Each of them would look at his robe and see whether there was anything still needed, and make a full appropriation, in his conscience and intelligence, of the precious blood of Christ which cleanseth from all sin. They had done that, and they were victorious. They knew it, and they ascribe salvation to God, and we are told of them, that they are before the throne of God, and serve Him day and night in His temple. I cannot go into all that is said of them right down to the end of the chapter, but only point out this, that they are worthy of heaven's interest; heaven, through the elder, calling the prophet John's attention to them that he might know them. They belong to a class. There are a great multitude and "they who come out", we are told, "of the great tribulation"; not simply a tribulation, but *the* one -- terrible experience, but coming out victoriously, a great triumph. We are on the fringe of it. The Lord Jesus has promised the saints of this dispensation to keep them out of the great tribulation, but these white-robed saints under our notice come through it. They
{129}
come out of it, we are told, a great crowd, showing that, after the Lord Jesus comes for us, there will be another gospel effecting great results. He "shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord"(@1 Thessalonians 4:16,17) -- after that there will proceed another gospel. Things will be done quickly -- an angel is seen flying, having the everlasting glad tidings to announce to all on earth. @Revelation 14:6; and there will be great results. Chapter 7 speaks of a great number of saved. They come out, having washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb, and they are before God, before His throne and serve Him day and night in His temple. How pleased heaven is with them! They are a class by themselves, secured through the gospel that is to come, but the same traits are to be seen in them as in us. It may be that there is someone here who has not washed his robes in the blood of the Lamb and made them white. If so, I would urge you to do it.
Now I come again to chapter 14 to show another group. These are numbered, the others are not; *they* are said to be "a great multitude, which no man could number". In chapter 14 we have the number stated -- a hundred and forty and four thousand, we are told, and they "follow the Lamb". I have been speaking of saving ourselves from a perverse, generation; from associations that are not of God. It is incumbent upon every Christian to withdraw from iniquity and purge himself from vessels to dishonour, so that he may be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the Master's use, and prepared unto every good work. It is incumbent, in the most urgent way, on everyone here to see that he does this. The time is short and the Lord is demanding it.
{130}
In this chapter we have a measured company, as I said -- very divisible, and they follow the Lamb. It is not now a question of washing their robes, that is assumed, but this passage goes further. It is a question of being with the Lamb -- in our times, to be with Christ as *separate from evil*. They are said to be "bought from the earth", which, of course, involves redemption, but they are "from the earth". They are bought for God, and it is said, as to the moral side, "These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the first fruits unto God and to the Lamb. And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God (@Revelation 14:4,5)". Now this has a very direct application to the present time, and what is stated enters into the classification that I have been speaking of. These form a class, they are on a higher level than those in chapter 7, for they are very divisible, implying that they understand love. They understand divine order; they understand how to hold themselves in relation to each other; they are free from rivalry of each other; they are like Nathaniel; he is their prototype in the sense that he was "an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile", (@John 1:47).
What guile there is, what dark counsels are current in the world! Each of us knows in his own heart the tendency to guile. These have not any. They are bought from the earth and from among men. They are first -- fruits to God. They belong to the same period as the great multitude do, only they are now intelligently and affectionately, as I may say, with Christ, as also with one another. For a hundred and forty-four thousand, as I said, denotes that we are truly with one another in affection; that the Lord can call upon any one of us to serve, and that one is ready to so do without any sense of superiority to others. He is just one of the number that is under the Lord's hand, he loves the Lord, and
{131}
he loves his brethren. He is for the Lord, he is with the Lord, and will say to any of his fellows. It is the Lord's work, you do it, or I will. It is only one work and mount Zion is the great centre of it. "Here will I dwell", says God, "for I have desired it", (@Psalm 132:14). It is the place of divine satisfaction and pleasure, hence love must be there. We cannot be pleasing to God without it. This is a voice to us, for if I "have not love, I am nothing (@1 Corinthians 13:2)". Be it the most learned man in this city today, he is nothing if he has not love. That is what scripture says. It is a very sweeping statement, and ought to be faced. The Lord Jesus says, "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves", (@John 13:35). How can an organisation of men, of whom some are unconverted, perhaps infidels, perhaps those that deny the authority of scripture, or deny the deity of Christ; how can there be love in such a fellowship? The Lord never thought of classifying such people amongst His disciples. "Love amongst yourselves" involves reality among us. The Lord spoke of "love amongst yourselves" as Judas had gone out, @John 13:35. "Love amongst yourselves" requires that we should withdraw from associations where love cannot operate.
This one hundred and forty-four thousand symbolically refers to persons who, under the Lord's hand, were lovable, being of those who love, so that He can proceed with the great thoughts of God in relation to mount Zion. As the assembly today is the centre on earth of divine operations, so in that day, mount Zion and Jerusalem will be the great centre, and these one hundred and forty-four thousand -- a symbolical number -- are persons under the Lord's hand who, as subjects of the divine work, are seen with Him on mount Zion. They are intelligent as well as having love. There is a song being sung above and they listen to it. They are not part of the assembly; they are on the earth, on
{132}
mount Zion, but they have corresponding traits to those who form the assembly. What they have, we have, or ought to have, and the Lord would suggest to us that we should not be without these traits if we want to be in classifications that are honourable in that day. It says, "I heard a voice out of the heaven as a voice of many waters, and as a voice of great thunder. And the voice which I heard was as of harp-singers harping with their harps". The word "harp" is striking here: it is a sort of representative musical instrument of heaven. In fact, there is no musical instrument mentioned other than the harp in heaven, I understand. It is a stringed instrument spoken of in the Old Testament, and in the use of it the vocal powers are free to join in with the music of the harpers. This was a new song. Think of the vastness of the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder! This describes what John heard: the voice of "harp-singers, harping with their harps". Applying this in a natural sense, how can we listen to the harpers harping with their harps here, or hear that voice of many waters, with the voice of thunder in our ears? The Spirit of God is impressing us with the magnitude of the thing. What a voice! What a song! Heaven has its own sounds, and if it designs to use these in relation to music, who can question it? The music is discerned, notwithstanding. It is a heavenly matter, the singers are there, and those on mount Zion are near enough to heaven to hear, and they value what is sung. It is said, "they sing a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders. And no one could learn that song save the hundred and forty and four thousand, who were bought from the earth".
These form the second class that I had in mind as illustrative of my subject. They are identified in God's world by their love and devotedness to Christ, by the order and the intelligence that marks them. All these
{133}
things apply at the present time to those of us who have part in assembly service. It is a time for perfecting it. Such a class as this will have a great place in that world; persons marked by the things I have spoken of, and who can learn such a song as this; although on earth. They can learn a new song, sung in heaven. What a choir above! Do we not aspire to such service? Is it not attractive, so that we should go in for it now, and understand the manner of the service of God, with our David, who is the sweet Psalmist of Israel, whose "instruments" are perfect in the song? There may be some present who have hardly thought of all this. Perhaps the Lord may be speaking to some one in this respect, attracting you by what there is in the divine realm -- the realm of *faith* now, presently to be the realm of *sight*.
Thirdly, chapter 20 is distinctly a resurrection scene, and not only a resurrection scene, but a heavenly scene. In this book the centre of everything is heaven, as it is today. Although the assembly is here and is the centre of God's operations, it is heavenly. It is like the great sheet let down from heaven, spoken of in @Acts 10. That chapter indicates what the assembly is now, a heavenly vessel on earth for testimony, about to be taken up to heaven. Verse 6 in @Revelation 20 depicts a heavenly scene, but what is stressed is resurrection. It is said, "This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy he who has part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no power; but they shall be priests of God and of the Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years". It is "that world, and the resurrection" (@Luke 20:35); the thousand years, that is, what we call the millennium, where all these things I am speaking of will come into display, where our classification will be seen, where one will be over ten cities, and another over five, according to his classification. Here we have three classes of persons under one head -- that is,
{134}
persons who have part in the first resurrection. The authorised version is somewhat defective as to these classes. The first is, "I saw thrones; and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them". That is one class, referring undoubtedly to those who form the assembly. Judgment is given them, and they are sitting upon thrones. The epistles to the Corinthians make a great deal of judgment. Viewed thus, I commend them to you at this time. There is great stress laid upon judgment; above all, each of us is to judge himself, for if I do not judge myself, I cannot judge others according to God. It is thus that the assembly is being taught as to judgment. "Know ye not", says the apostle, "that we shall judge angels?" (@1 Corinthians 6:3); and again, "ye also shall sit on twelve thrones", the Lord says to the disciples, "judging the twelve tribes of Israel", (@Matthew 19:28). Judgment will be a great feature attaching to the assembly in that day. Hence the need for learning it now, and, above all, each should learn to judge himself. A man that rules his own spirit, through self-judgment, is greater than he that takes a city. If he rules his own spirit, he will be in the greatest of all cities -- he will be an integral part of the heavenly city as it comes down. He has to learn how to judge -- to execute judgment. Thus, the first class here sit on thrones.
In regard to the second class, the passage tells us that John saw "the souls of those beheaded on account of the testimony of Jesus, and on account of the word of God". Thirdly, there are those "who had not done homage to the beast nor to his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and hand". These classifications have present applications. The first one directly applies to ourselves, that is, we are to know how to exercise judgment; we have part in the heavenly city. The second and third are persons who come in later. They belong to the short period which is to succeed our period, which is a very long one. This
{135}
short period, regarded as *critical* in God's ways, when good and evil are brought into peculiar evidence, will bring to light these persons who will suffer peculiarly. This is my last point -- the question of suffering. I shall be ashamed in the day of Christ if I have not something in the way of suffering to my account; and normally I believe every saint would feel that way. It is good for us to suffer. "Take thy share in suffering", says the apostle Paul, (@2 Timothy 2:3). The evading of it is to our loss; and so these persons are spoken of as "the souls of those beheaded on account of the testimony of Jesus, and on account of the word of God". They were beheaded. Why should that be said? There can be no doubt that the allusion is to spiritual intelligence, which the enemy would especially put out of his way. How important it is -- particularly in difficult days -- to be intelligent! The priest's turban, or head covering, was ornamented, and upon it were the words "*Holiness to the Lord"*. It denoted holiness of thought, holiness of understanding -- all infinitely perfect in Christ. The saints are said to "have the mind of Christ (@1 Corinthians 2:16)". This implies that each has learned to judge himself as regards his natural mind, not allowing it at all in divine things. It is a curse in divine things. The natural mind does not understand the things of God, @1 Corinthians 2:14. It is a question of holiness -- dependent on the renewal of the mind, @Romans 12:2. This is by the Holy Spirit, who gives us intelligence in the things of God. I suppose the beheading here implies opposition to that. Persecutions against the people of God usually aim at their leaders -- those who are devoted to the testimony and who understand the mind of God; but the word here would be to urge us to that holiness of understanding and thought. The enemy knows its importance and hence beheads these victorious saints. John the baptist was beheaded.
The third class in our passage are persons "which
{136}
had not worshipped the best, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands". What a voice that is today! This evil, called the mark of the beast, with which God takes direct issue in the earlier part of this book, is a peculiar feature of modern times. The great impetus given to human intelligence in these times, beginning particularly with the Reformation, and the circulation of ancient literature at that time and later, greatly stimulated the human mind. Giants in human ability have come into evidence and through them an immense variety of inventions, bringing, to a large extent, misery on mankind. It is irony, but it is so. God would have His people possess a judgment of all this; deliverance is really in that -- "your judgment", the Spirit of God says. @Revelation 18:20. God is calling upon us to have a judgment of current things. This matter of the mark of the beast is one of the leading factors of the modern world. It is going to be full -- blown presently, and these martyrs suffer because they refuse it. Are we to be behind them? -- Surely not! They are brought in here lest there should be any question as to their part in the heavenly position. All those who suffer martyrdom in the coming day -- the greatest day of persecution -- will have their place in the heavenlies, the assembly always having a distinct place there. The assembly never loses her distinction, but still there are other families in heaven as well as the assembly. Do we not rejoice in that? It is a question of the Father's glory. Of the Father, we are told, "every family in the heavens and on earth is named", (@Ephesians 3:15). I am speaking now of the moral side, they had not done homage to the beast, nor to his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and hand. The passage continues with the statement, "they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years", verse 4. Then verse 6 says, "Blessed and holy he who has part in the first resurrection: over these the second death has no
{137}
power; but they shall be priests of God and of the Christ (@Revelation 20:6)". They are serving others. Then again, they "shall reign with him a thousand years".
That is what I had to say, but in order to clarify the position, I would say that class two will be most glorious; martyrs, you might say, of the first order standing out against what we have to do with now in a diluted form. They will have it in all its intensity, and they will love not their lives unto death. They are triumphant and will live and reign with Christ publicly. The millennial glory of Christ is contemplated: we shall share it with Him. After the judgment-seat of Christ our identity comes out; it will be determined, from these moral traits, and it will be glorious, the traits are glorious; and, dear brethren, it is in our hands now to qualify so that we may have an abundant entrance into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. I could say other things, but I would like to make clear that, in this book, identification is a great feature. Even the heavenly city is identified by certain marks, and what I have said on these three passages will show how we are to be classified, and it is within our range now to qualify by having these traits, so that our part in that day will be glorious, and we shall not be amongst those whose works are burned up.
{138}
GREAT THINGS
@John 1:46 - 51; @Acts 2:4 - 11; @Revelation 21: 9 - 17
I wish, dear brethren, to speak about *great things*. The word *great* in the Scriptures applies to what is evil as well as to what is good. The worst formation known is great Babylon -- the word is used in regard to her, and applied to many men in the history of the world; it carries largely the thought of evil exploits, for unregenerate man is capable of admiring evil doings. The whole world will presently wonder after the beast; saying, Who is like him? Who can make war with him? Yet in a moment he is destroyed, he and his lieutenant, the false prophet, are taken and cast *alive* into the lake of fire, without any effort, without any struggle of arms even. @Revelation 19:20. And likewise, the great promoter of all evil himself -- Satan, that old serpent as he is called, the devil, -- one angel takes him, and chains him, and places him in the pit.
It is well to have these things in our minds, so that we may not be alarmed by man's doings, however great they may seem to be; for, as to each of the personages in the world, who are called great, their breath is in their nostrils. Thus the mind of the believer is turned by the Spirit of God to the One of whom Gabriel says, "He shall be great(@Luke 1:32)". Gabriel says that of Jesus as about to be born.
The Spirit would call our attention to Him at this time. John does not present Him to us as a Babe, but as become flesh. He says, "the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father), full of grace and truth (@John 1:14)". He is great!
Nathanael, following on others in this chapter, shows us a believer, just coming into the realm of
{139}
faith, and at once discerning the greatness of Jesus; a true mark of a worshipper, one who begins to see the greatness of Jesus, and less and less of the greatness of man. More and more do real believers, as the Holy Spirit operates in us and opens our eyes to Jesus, turn away from what might have held us and dazzled our minds. This chapter is a galaxy of personages affected by and reflecting the glories of Jesus; of Him who is introduced to us at once: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God ... . All things received being through him, and without him not one thing received being which has received being. In him was life, and the life was the light of men (@John 1:1,3,4)". There He is! The Spirit of God alone could put such words together, and the Son of God alone, a divine Person, could become the theme of such words; no creature could become the theme of such words. The words themselves are divinely set, and tend to affect us, and cause us to turn aside from what is current -- men and their doings -- to Jesus; to Him who is presented in these wonderful verses. So, as I said, amongst those who are thus affected is Nathanael, an ordinary man, as we might say, hitherto not spoken of, sitting under his fig-tree, and he hears about Jesus, having been found by Philip. The Lord Himself had found Philip.
The word *found* has a special place in this section of the chapter, and every true believer understands that; how one is found by Christ. He finds Philip Himself. It always comes home to one; each believer can say, Jesus found me, entered into relations with me, had a transaction with me. He found Philip, and Philip found Nathanael. The idea of finding marks this gospel. Philip found Nathanael, and says to him, "We have found him ... Jesus, the son of Joseph, who is from Nazareth (@John 1:45)". He had found Jesus. In truth, that is how the matter stands, Jesus has found me, and I
{140}
have found Him, and the result is eternal. Philip's remarks to Nathanael elicit from him the evidence that there was very little in his soul at this time, the fig-tree would be very much his environment; it is often the case with men and women, and young people; how small is our environment; a little bit of dress, it maybe, or a house, and a garage and a car, and so forth; living in a narrow environment. Philip brought infinitude to the attention of Nathanael, that is indeed what every true evangelist does, he brings infinitude to us, "the gospel of God ... concerning his Son". Nathanael is not equal at the moment to the great news brought to him; far otherwise: "Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?" he asks. Think of the paltriness of that! as one affected, like Philip, says, "We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the law, and the prophets, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph (@John 1:45)".
The words affected Nathanael but little, yet he was capable of being moved, for he responded to Philip's invitation, "Come and see". John *will* have movement, he will not leave anyone sitting; if the light comes to where he is sitting, if he stays there, he is of no account to John -- I mean the spirit of God through John. There is nothing of God in one not capable of moving; he may talk glibly about things, but spiritual movement is required. One may come to a meeting like this out of curiosity to hear what is said, but unless there is capability of spiritual movement you are here in vain. So Philip's invitation, "Come and see", moved Nathanael. He had no hesitation in saying that, for Philip knew well that anyone who would come and see would be affected; he had been affected himself. And so the Lord looks on Nathanael coming to Him. One often thinks of this, how the Lord looks at persons as they come to Him, the Last Adam. The first Adam looked at the animals and named them, but Christ names men, knowing them by their movements. He says of
{141}
Peter, "thou shalt be called Cephas (@John 1:42)". He named him as looking on him. That is the idea. Andrew had brought Simon to Him, and He named him. He is the last Adam; He is not naming the animals and birds, as the first Adam did; Jesus is naming men, naming them as He sees them moving to Him. When He saw Nathanael coming to Him, He said, "Behold one truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile". One has often thought of that, *no guile* , how much guile there is, even among God's people; the Lord says of Nathanael, no guile. Nathanael rightly says to the Lord, "Whence knowest thou me?" and the Lord responded, as He does respond at all times where there are reasonable questions -- such questions as evidence real interest. As seeking to serve in the gospel, one has to do a good deal with young people, and in some there is no response, not even a word. Young persons can talk at length about other things, but if you ask them about their souls there is no word. That is the evidence of the absence of life. The Lord loves to converse with us, and those who are seeking our souls also love to converse with young people.
The Lord was pleased, I am sure, with Nathanael's inquiry, "Whence knowest thou me?" The Lord did not turn aside from that question, nor answer it with another, as He sometimes did; He said, "Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee". He throws Nathanael back on his own history: before Philip called him. What was going on in his mind then? Was he thinking of the figs on the tree, or what might be on it later? The Lord knew just what was transpiring in his soul. Nathanael was not slow to discern the greatness that was before him; that is the point, for we are to become full of the greatness of Christ, so that all else might be eclipsed. Nathanael was full of greatness, not his own greatness, but the greatness of Christ; he said, "thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel". He grasped in his
{142}
soul something of the greatness of Christ. The Lord said, "Thou shalt see greater things than these". The Lord is always ready to lead forward one impressed with His greatness, and our minds can never be too big for Him. One is always challenged as to the littleness of one's mind. Solomon comes into such exercise; a man like ourselves, but given great largeness of heart. He spoke, you might say, of everything living; even botany, life in all its phases, but not the *heavenly* side of the truth. Solomon had great largeness of mind and heart. *One would crave largeness of mind, of the renewed mind, to take in the great things that are in Christ*. The Lord says of Nathanael. "Thou shalt see greater things than these". Increase in greatness is the thought; infinite greatness is in Christ. So the Lord says, further, "Verily, verily, I say to you. Henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man". Notice the change of number; it is "ye" now, for in truth, when the greatness of divine things is in view, we need *all* the saints. I get on better as with the saints in considering the things of God; my mind becomes freer and more enlarged in relation to the brethren, than it is when I am by myself. @Ephesians 3:18 says, "in order that ye may ... apprehend with all the saints". We are helped as with the saints. As Nathanael used the title the "Son of God" he referred to Christ in relation to His kingship of Israel. The truth of our dispensation involves greater things. What great things belong to us!
In referring to the Acts, I do so because it relates to the Spirit of God coming down from heaven, freshly; the Spirit, of course, is never other than fresh, but still one may have latitude to express what marked His early activity as come down. The Lord Himself refers to the Holy Spirit, saying that He "goes forth from with the Father", @John 15:26, as if to set the mind on the relations of the Spirit with the Father in heaven, and
{143}
how He would carry out down here on earth, the Father's thoughts about Christ, the Father's thoughts, too, about everything that we should know. Hence, before Peter begins to speak, the account tells us of the saints to whom the Spirit had come; it was a matter, as you will all know, of a filled house, the saints are seen here as in a *house*, not simply an upper room; it is called a house, and the house was filled with the sound. A sound as of a rushing mighty wind is heard from heaven, and it filled the house where they were sitting. Was there ever a house like it? We hear of the Houses of Parliament, and such great places in relation to men, but think of this house! Think of the sound that entered into it and filled it! The sound would not exclude certain other things, but it filled the house, and the Holy Spirit came in the form of cloven tongues of fire, and it sat upon each; every person in the house was affected; each was identified; each had his own distinction. The Spirit came in in relation to that distinction, the Spirit was in them according to the distinction the work of Christ had imparted to each of those persons; the Spirit comes in to enlarge it, and make it suitable for testimony here and for eternity with Christ. All that is included in the work of the Spirit as here in the assembly. Here in Jerusalem are devout men, Jews from all parts of the then world, and they hear the apostles speak in their own tongues "the great things of God". That is what believers should be talking about, and it challenges our hearts as to whether we are giving the doings of men more place than the great things of God. I am now calling attention to the action of the Spirit of God in the saints; He gives us "to speak forth" in testimony. And then the writer tells us that they were speaking of the great things of God. This implies deliverance from the present state of things, and the conditions which have arisen which the enemy would use to overwhelm us. *The people of God are in danger of being*
{144}
*darkened in their minds by current things, which the enemy would use to darken our minds and oppress us, whereas the Holy Spirit would keep us on the line of the great things of God*. They will stand when the great things of men will disappear for ever, and it is our privilege to speak about them, and that according to the example set at Pentecost. Speaking of His great things directs hearts to God Himself.
In occupation with the things of God, we learn how to name them. The brethren have remarkable experiences, the Lord having revived the truth and brought us back to original thoughts and operations; still we become so accustomed to them that we are apt to lose the sense of their greatness. The operations of the Spirit of God now are in themselves great relatively, even as the rising of the dead; the Spirit's operations are God's operations, and they are going on. Believers are the subjects of the Spirit's work, and we are apt to think too little of them, to minimise them, whereas they are really great, the great things of God. The epistle of the Ephesians opens them up to us in an especial way, and we shall enter into them soon as the heavenly city. I am referring again to the plural *ye* in the Lord's reply to Nathanael. The Lord would bring us *together* to speak of these things to us, to think of these things. He says, "Henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened", etc. There are greater things, and still greater. We are living in the period of the opened heavens; let this be impressed upon our minds. The epistle to the Hebrews contemplates the opened heavens. "We see Jesus ... crowned with glory and honour",(@Hebrews 2:9) it says; it is heaven opened to us, and so the Lord says to Nathanael, "ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man". He is not calling attention to the angels by themselves. He is calling attention to the fact that He must come first in our minds; they
{145}
ascend and descend on *Him*. The idea is that Christ is first, and so the greatest creatures are attending on Him. If you look into heaven you will see Christ is everything *there*. As ascending on Him, the angels begin with Him. They do not descend on Him first, but ascend: they began with Him down here. Stephen looked into the opened heavens and "saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God (@Acts 7:55)". @Hebrews 2:9 says, "We see Jesus ... crowned with glory and honour".
I would now turn briefly to the last scripture read, just to show how all this greatness is seen in relation to the assembly and how we are essential to it according to divine purpose; we are part of it. The Lord's statement, "Ye shall see the heaven opened" is carried through. Peter sees the heaven opened and a great sheet coming down, knit at the four corners; that refers to ourselves, it is full of all creatures which God had cleansed. It is called "a certain vessel ... bound by the four corners,(@Acts 10:11)" it is held in divine power. It refers to the assembly, in the purpose of God, as I said, essential to the great things. The Spirit tells us in @Revelations 21, that one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, said to John, "Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife ..." I will *show* thee -- that is another word I want you to get into your minds. We need to be shown from the very outset; the principle of being shown is stressed in the Scriptures. This angel was one of those who had had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues; *"had had"* implies that that was past; the judgment is a past thing; he is now occupied with the present thing; the present positive result of the work of God, and it is included in the great things of God. Outside of divine Persons, nothing is greater than the mystery, the assembly. Would that the Lord would bring that home to our souls. It is seen here, shown by an angel who
{146}
earlier had to do with judgment, and I may say that unless each of us has had to do with judgment, and is governed by judgment, we shall not have understanding of this great matter, "the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God".
It is the angel that judges, and corresponding with it the apostle says, "Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity (@2 Timothy 2:19)". Otherwise we shall not see this wonderful sight; it requires that we shall judge the current evil of the professing system, if we are to come into the light and appreciation of the heavenly city; it is one of the great things of God. John is privileged to see it -- in this book he is not an apostle, he is a prophet; as an apostle his name is in the foundations of the city; one of the foundations, but he is a prophet here. We are living in times in which prophecy is having a place, and it enters into this, for if we are to understand the great things of God we need the prophetic word, the prophetic word brings God, and His great things, to us.
John says, "and shewed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, having the glory of God. Her shining was like a most precious stone, as a crystal-like jasper stone". You can understand that the holy city is, as I said, one of the great things of God, "Her shining was like a most precious stone, as a crystal-like jasper stone". What a change from the murky things that are around us -- evil counsel and lying statements! The man of sin comes "in all deceit of unrighteousness (@2 Thessalonians 2:10)". "Bright as crystal" is the river, too, that flows out of the city, all is clear. Then there is the measuring of the great city, which idea is to affect our minds. Twelve thousand stadia is said to be the measure. Think of the vastness of it, the length, breadth, and height being equal! Vastness is the idea that the Holy Spirit would get into our minds, and this wonderful thing is really composed *of persons*, of
{147}
what the Holy Spirit has effected in our dispensation from Pentecost to the coming of the Lord. Think of the myriads of persons, all actuated by one mind, actuated by love! The Spirit helps us to see the force of the language used in the Scriptures to describe the mystery, and to describe the assembly -- and each of us can say to himself, I belong to that! What could be greater to get into your soul than that you belong to it? Understanding the truth of it, you say, I want to function in that, I want to come in with Christ and be in relation to Him, that He may be my Head, as belonging to that! God is carrying out His great thoughts, and about to display them in this wonderful thing called the heavenly city, which comes down out of heaven from Himself.
Well, dear brethren, that is what I had in mind, mentioning the measurements at the end. As I said, the Holy Spirit would impress our *minds* with them. The height of the wall is a hundred and forty-four cubits. Think of the height of that as a wall stands! Add fifty per cent and you have the *feet* measurement of the wall, and that is intended to impress our minds with something, that is, exclusiveness: that nothing of what is evil, nor common, nor that maketh an abomination and a lie shall enter into it. And the effect of that is to make me exclusive *now*, that is what it is for, that I may function in a little way in relation to this great matter, and see how the assembly itself is part of the great system of things that are called the great things of God. We are to be in them, occupied with them, dear brethren. To say the least, it means deliverance from the present darkness. Satan would darken our minds with current events, but the Lord would keep us in clarity of mind and spirit, so that we move in love in the presence of the evil and in spite of it, and that is victory! "Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?"(@1 John 5:5)
{148}
DIVINE COMFORT AND PROTECTION
@Isaiah 26:20; @Genesis 6:14 - 16; @Genesis 7:7 - 16; @Genesis 45:9 - 11,17 - 21
I had in mind to show from these scriptures what God provides for His people in the way of comfort and protection as emergencies come, especially those expressive of His judicial dealings.
The judicial dealings of God sometimes become positively punitive, as in the destruction of Jerusalem. That was a judicial act of God, more extreme than others, and had a punitive character. The Lord when alluding to Jerusalem encompassed by armies says, "these be the days of vengeance (@Luke 21:22)". Although this dispensation is one of grace, yet God, at all times, reserves the right to act punitively, particularly as regards His ancient people. He has allowed them to come in nationally into our dispensation, as an act of grace, but being insubject to Christ the wrath of God came upon them, as John says in his gospel, "he that is not subject to the Son ... . the wrath of God abides upon him", @John 3:36. That applies now. Although the world is in reconciliation, and any Jew repenting comes in for grace, yet the punitive judgment of God on the Jews nationally continues. Divine grace prevailed, so that some should be saved, and hence we are told, that "the Lord added daily those that were to be saved (@Acts 2:47)". He added them where the most comforting and protective circumstances obtained. The most blessed of all the shelters which God has afforded in times of stress arising from His own judgment is seen in @Acts 2. What happy conditions resulted from Peter's preaching, and the work of God that preceded it, in the one hundred and twenty! The description is remarkable before it is said that the Lord "added".
That furnishes a key to what I have to say at this
{149}
time, for God is undoubtedly dealing judicially at the present time, and He would have us with Him in it. He comes our way, going on to judgment, and although the present dealings are not final, they have a judicial character, and God comes our way on His journey to the execution of judgment, so that it enters into our period. He would have us to be with Him in what He is doing. He is pleased to take on friends, I should not like to be other than a friend of God, and He comes to us so as to draw us into the current of His mind, and make us His friends. It is thus in Abraham's case, in @Genesis 18. God came to him, as on the journey to Sodom, but Abraham was not the final objective. Mamre was not the terminus of the journey, it was on the way. God is now on the way to judgment; and in principle we are in the time of His judicial dealings already; they are not final, but His dealings are of that character, and He comes to us on His way. He comes our way, and would call us into accord with His mind as to what He is going on to.
In @Genesis 18:16, God was leaving Abraham without saying anything to him as to what He had in His mind. Abraham entertained Him well, and Jehovah accepted the patriarch's hospitality. A most lovely picture of it is drawn by the Spirit in @Genesis 18, but God was now on His way, moving on away from Abraham with the two angels, and Abraham went with Him. That is what God looks for in His visits, that we go with Him. Abraham went with Him "to conduct them", and then Jehovah says, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing?"(@Genesis 18:17) He had not said a word to him about it under the tree, when He was accepting his hospitality. You might have thought that He should have opened up His mind to him, but He did not; He waited until Abraham moved with Him, so the word comes from God, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing?" And then He says, "For I know that he will command
{150}
his children and his household after him ... to do righteousness and justice, in order that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham what he hath spoken of him(@Genesis 18:19)". This brings Abraham into the whole position of the government of God, so that he says, "Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?" (@Genesis 18:25) He did not say that under the tree, but now he has moved with God, and he is on the ground of friendship. He speaks freely to Jehovah and says, "the Judge of all the earth"; that is a new title, which God receives at the hand of His servant; not that He was not this before, but Abraham now names Him thus; and so it is that Abraham became the friend of God; he is later called this. He became known in that way, and one wants to be so known. No doubt many here have come into it, and perhaps others are being interested as I speak; the way is open, God is, as it were, asking you to come into this, to be one of His friends; to be a confidant of God, one to whom He may disclose His mind. You get impressions from God in that way, far more accurate than the news of the day; the impressions you get you could hardly put into words, but they are distinct and for yourself. It is assuring to receive impressions from Him. Abraham is called the friend of God, and God would call us into this. Nothing could be greater at the present time, because He is going on to the completion of all His thoughts, and He looks for sympathy and companionship in it, and He has it, thank God; He has those who are friendly with Him, and who want to know what He is doing.
Abraham would modify what God had in His mind, and God is ready to accede if Abraham could show that conditions warranted it. It is an important matter, to go over the field and see what basis there is for prayers, what basis there is for asking God to do things; He is ready to listen to us. He listened to Abraham most patiently until Abraham had to stop. What I am saying
{151}
is really a very touching thing, and ought to appeal to us, for God is going on, and He is ready to open up His mind to us -- Shall I hide from Abraham ... ? (@Genesis 18:17) It is because of conditions in Abraham, and later he is called a friend of God. He comes down to us with that title, and it is surely that we might, as children of Abraham, come in for our inheritance among those who are friends of God, but friends according to the conditions indicated in our father Abraham. Of Zacchaeus the Lord Jesus says, "he also is a son of Abraham", but that was because of conditions in him, as the passage shows, @Luke 19:8,9. Surely we want to come into the inheritance of Abraham.
Now there are things existent that are causing pressure, and I want to show you how God would relieve us in this that He opens up to us, without easing the conditions for the moment, but indicating that they will come to an end. The first verse I read says, "Come, my people, enter into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee; hide thyself just for a little moment, until the indignation be past". There is a limit to it. Instead of staying out in the storm, faith finds a way *inside*. It is not the holiest here -- it is like the word in @Matthew 6:6, "enter into thy chamber", something that *you* have, "and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father who sees in secret will render it to thee (@Matthew 6:6)". He will do it. Here also in Isaiah it is what God's people have, "thy chambers". Let us look round and see whether we have such places of recourse to God, places belonging to our -- selves. Some have recourse to prayer when the storm comes; we hear of "public prayers", in the presence of an impending storm. Well, that is not the thought, that is not enough for God, neither is it enough for faith. What characterises us in our attitude Godward, is that we have *learned* to pray, and are marked by prayer.
{152}
It touches one to refer to the fact that the Lord was praying in a certain place and one of His disciples said to Him, "Lord, teach us to pray",(@Luke 11:1) as if to say, That is what all of us need. He did not say. Teach *me* to pray, but Teach *us* -- he was a true community brother; it is an Ephesian touch. It is a great advantage that the Lord in His attitude towards God should come within our range, that we may see Him pray, and hear Him pray. This disciple saw Him, and says, "Lord, teach us to pray",(@Luke 11:1) It was what they all needed, and we need secret chambers as well as places of public collective prayer; the latter, of course, are of immense importance, for the house of God is called a house of prayer for all nations; where God makes His people glad, @Isaiah 56:6,7. Here in Isaiah it is "thy chambers". Getting to God in your own way, in your accustomed times, and out of your accustomed times; one of the best times is in the wakeful hours of the night. Let us learn to take advantage of all such opportunities. It is a question of what is known individually by experience: "enter into thy chambers", it says, "and shut thy doors about thee; hide thyself just for a little moment, until the indignation be past", It is all within your range, it is no question of religious show, but secret access -- your own way towards God.
Such is the divine way of escape from the indignation that is affecting others. In Acts it is said, "the Lord added (to the assembly) daily those that were to be saved(@Acts 2:47)". That was the Lord's doing. He brought them into that environment, but now this is our matter, dear brethren, "enter into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee; hide thyself just for a little moment". Learn to do this often; if you only get relief for a short time, it will become longer the next time; learn to do it. Instead of carrying the burden, have recourse to your own chambers, shut your own doors, and "hide thyself just for a little moment, until the indignation be past".
{153}
That is positive relief, even as if the storm did not exist. The storm is apt to be too much for us. The word to Elijah was, "the journey is too great for thee(@1 Kings 19:7)". He went on a way of unbelief, but still God through His angel pursued His servant, and made calves for him, and gave them to him, saying the way was too long. God thus had sympathy with His servant, and made provision for him. So now He would have us take advantage of what there is provided for us in the way of an escape from pressure. It is of course a spiritual thought, and if, as I said, it is only for a moment that your soul is entirely released from the pressure, the next time will be longer. You get nearer to God each time, and there is no disturbance, no pressure there.
God is considerate for us. He knows our frame. He knows the enemy has peculiar advantage at the present time, for he is using current circumstances to oppress us, and hence the need to have recourse to God; we shall come out the stronger. The pressure may not be lessened, but we become stronger, and more like God. He, indeed, becomes "a little sanctuary" to us, so that we not only have a hiding-place, but also the gain of His presence.
I go on now to Genesis, so that we may see how safe the position is, it is not my chambers now, it is God's ark, what He has made. It is a staunch affair, it is impregnable to what is against us, being pitched inside and outside. It is of considerable size, three hundred cubits long, as you observe, the breadth is fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits, a good-sized ship, even now, especially in length. The ark being pitched within and without with pitch is to assure us that it will go through, we can trust it. An important matter to get into our souls is that there is that of God which is trustworthy, you can trust it. What comfortable quarters there are inside, no stifling
{154}
atmosphere is suggested: there are first, second, and third stories, and rooms in it as well, as you will observe, providing comfort. At that time God had in mind to impress people with the fact that a storm was pending; the most far -- reaching punitive act of God that has come upon the earth so far, but, there were those that were to be saved, and they are to have confidence in the thing provided, to understand that it is reliable, and that it is not wanting in the needed comfort. There is an outlet above, it has a small window in the top; God's measured provision so that those inside could look up. There are family affections there, too; no children are mentioned, but a family of full-grown persons; four families, we may say, to accentuate the thought, but all regarded as one house -- Noah's house. Thus the ark not only affords protection, but also family affections.
In @Genesis 7 it is said that "Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowl, and of everything that creeps on the ground, there came two and two unto Noah into the ark". That is the position, there is an *attraction* there. If anyone here is not affected, it is because you do not understand the subtle currents that exist in the spiritual world. The spiritual world has a certain correspondence to the material universe; the latter has currents, and so has the spiritual world. The Lord Jesus says, for instance, "Now is the judgment of this world, ... and I, if I be lifted up out of the earth, will draw all to me", (@John 12:31,32). That is the position now, and it is the position indicated in this scripture in Genesis; the judgment of the world is pending, but there is an attraction in Noah different from all else. He is six hundred years old, a mature, experienced man, taken on by God, and now he is*in position*. We do not hear of the animals going to him when he is outside the ark, it is when he is in position, that is, as with his family inside, he is attractive. Is not Jesus attractive
{155}
to us all? One says, I do not care for the brethren, as an antediluvian who heard Noah preach might say, I do not care for Shem's wife, or for Ham's wife, nor have I much interest in those animals that are going in there. That person is electing himself out of the means and sphere of salvation. He is incapable of being attracted, but as the Spirit of God gives a glimpse of Jesus in position, as seen in Noah, you will be attracted. Stephen saw Him above, at the right hand of God; but what is before us now is not only Christ in that position, but also *in relation to His people*. His family, as it were. That is involved in the adding spoken of in @Acts 2: the Lord added those that were to be saved to those who were linked together by the Holy Spirit. He is in position amongst them and most attractive. So it is with Noah, he is among his family: Shem is there, Ham is there, Japheth is there, and their wives are there, Noah's wife is there -- eight of them; and as in this position, all the creatures come to him two by two -- *they* come -- there is attraction in it, they go to him as in family position, they go into the ark to Noah, and they are saved. They come in two by two, unto Noah "and the Lord shut him in". The position in which salvation is secured, as seen also in @Isaiah 46:13, is most attractive, and I would urge anyone who does not understand to look into it. It is a spiritual matter; we are to get under the influence of the Holy Spirit's current leading as to it; Christ in heaven and in relation to His own down here -- that is the assembly.
We should now see how the matter of time enters into all this. The six hundredth year of Noah's life is mentioned, and the day that he entered into the ark, and on that very day the flood came! What a day it was! A day of salvation for those who went in, but a day of unmitigated judgment for those who remained outside. The Lord Himself refers to this in His service on earth. He speaks of "the day that Noah entered into the
{156}
ark"(@Matthew 24:38) -- what were they doing? He says, they were eating, which was quite legitimate, and they were drinking, which was quite legitimate, and they were marrying, which was quite legitimate, they were given in marriage, which was quite legitimate. They were occupied with all these ordinary matters up to the very moment that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, says the Lord Jesus, and drowned them all. How grave that thought is! What a day it was! - and what a day *this* is! Almost every day brings a crisis in the world's affairs. Then we must think of what spiritual history enters into each day; some coming into the place of salvation, and others ignoring it and thus staying out. To stay out of the ark is the most foolish thing that anyone can do, the most absurd, and yet it is constantly going on. What a history of folly! On the other hand, what a history of wisdom and spiritual understanding! -- many availing themselves of what is available, the way of salvation as typified in Noah and his house in the ark.
In Genesis 45, in the verses I read, we have another thought. In Noah there was an attraction, and no great distance to be travelled to him, but in Joseph's day there is a long way to go. Another adverse thing is pending, indeed it exists: there were five years of famine to come, two already gone. It is thus an experienced matter, everyone knows the dreadfulness of it, and there are five years more, that is what Joseph tells his father and his brothers. Anyone who experiences a famine of food and water knows how affecting and depressing it is, how distressing! The brothers of Joseph and Jacob his father would understand, "because the famine was grievous",(@Genesis 41:57) and they all experienced it. In the midst of such conditions Joseph says, "tell my father of all my glory in Egypt". That is a very different thought, the glory of Christ where He is now is a great and blessed thought; but it is not simply *where*
{157}
He is now, but typically the place He has acquired among the Gentiles. Joseph also says, "Haste and go up to my father, and say to him, Thus says thy son Joseph: God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, tarry not. And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near to me, thou, and thy sons and thy sons¬ sons, and thy sheep, and thy cattle, and all that thou hast. And there will I maintain thee: for yet there are five years of famine; in order that thou be not impoverished, thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast", @Genesis 45:9,10. What a protective proposal this is as we feel the present pressure! We do not know how long it may be; and of course this passage may be widened out to cover the famine that is abroad in the world spiritually. Prophetically it alludes to the famine among the Jews, the judgment of God on them; and the Jewish remnant were to go out, as it were, among the Gentiles, to find Christ there, as Paul says, "Christ in you, the hope of glory", (@Colossians 1:27), that is what it is dispensationally.
To make the application present, we do not know how long this oppressive condition will last, but spiritually this is the way out of it: the Lord is presenting Himself here. Thy son Joseph, he says to Jacob, and, I will nourish thee, and you will be nearer to me. It is a long way to go, but then, he says, I want you to come, and I will maintain you (the word for nourish is maintain). One is maintained by the Lord Jesus in these circumstances; thus we are not overwhelmed by the pressure, we have everything we need in going out to Him and in keeping near Him. Joseph is the lord of all Egypt, he is in charge of all the resources in the way of food, and all the good of Egypt, he says to Jacob, is for you. That is, it is where Christ is. When Joseph is in Egypt it is not the same Egypt as it became afterwards, or as it was before; the Egypt with Joseph in it is a place of advantage. The Gentile world, when Christ is in it
{158}
and accepted in it, is better than the Jewish world, for Christ was rejected there.
Now the Lord is inviting us to come out of the realm of pressure, sending a message, I will maintain you, there will be no lack at all. It is *a faith* matter. To make the thing complete, Joseph says, "And there will I maintain thee; for yet there are five years of famine; in order that thou be not impoverished, thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast". Let us not forget that side, for the serious consequence, if we fail in energy of faith at this time, is that we will come to poverty, we will be so overcome with current things that we will come to poverty spiritually. Whereas the Lord is urging that we come to Him, He will nourish us where He is. For some it is a long way to go, as seen in this chapter, and if there are any here who think it is a long way to go, the Lord says, I will send you waggons, so that the journey will be easy, will be comfortable. I know what you are enduring. I know your outlook, but you will come to poverty if you stay there; your salvation is to come in faith to Me, to apprehend Me in My glory. Presently He is coming out with glory, putting His right foot on the sea and His left on the land, and the whole matter will be changed, but in the meantime we are to go out to Him, it is a faith matter, as I said, and the Lord says, in type here, I will maintain you, providing you with all that is necessary.
Pharaoh says, "Say to thy brethren. Do this: load your beasts and depart, go into the land of Canaan, and take your father and your households, and come to me; and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land. And thou art commanded -- this do", @Genesis 45:17. That is in the message, it is thus no optional matter, it is a command. To disregard a divine command is a serious matter, I need not say. The passage says further, "take waggons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones and for
{159}
your wives, and take up your father, and come. And let not your eye regret your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt shall be yours. And the sons of Israel did so; and Joseph gave them waggons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way". A long history follows, telling of the glad response of Jacob and his family to Joseph's offer, but I would stress that it is a commandment. The Lord orders us to come out to Him. What is in mind is that we should get to the Lord about the things pressing upon us, apprehending Him where He is. The Spirit of God would support us in this, so that we are outside of all these distressing things, and as living in our own realm, we shall not come to poverty. We are maintained in spirituality, the level that is needed in the service of God; for what is toward God in the assembly, and what is for Him in testimony here. The Lord is showing us the way by which we may be preserved in superiority to all that is current, and thus we are in safe keeping. In Egypt, according to this, you are out of the range of it; Joseph being lord of it, there is plenty of food, plenty of all that is needed, but the Lord says. You *must* come, I have given you the means to come; it is the Holy Spirit. We may thus reach the Lord, day and night; it is most urgent -- that we may live in His realm, where His glory is, and where there is abundance and we shall not come to poverty. May God bless His word!

MANHOOD
@John 16:20 - 28; @John 17:6,22 - 26
J.T. What is in mind is manhood in relation to the service of God. Here we have a *man born*, as entering this section of the Lord's instruction; and then, in chapter 17, He speaks of the disciples as men. These chapters, from 13 to 17, are to be taken in relation to the Lord's supper, John does not mention the Lord's supper, but he gives us much more which stands related to it in the Lord's closing words than the other evangelists, and he stresses manhood.
The Lord's supper is intended to bring in the youngest believers as well as the oldest, and hence we have the new covenant included in it, the young being particularly in mind, that we should be free from Judaism, maintaining liberty in the service of God. No one having the Holy Spirit and walking in the truth is omitted from the Lord's supper, although all may not be in the full thought in the service, for all cannot be said to be men in actual growth. It is in manhood that the full thought is secured for God, so that whilst the youngest is included in the service, ample room in the assembly is made for the greatest developments, and that is what these chapters have in mind, that is, manhood in the service of God.
In Deuteronomy, in conjunction with the instruction as to the three feasts -- the Passover, Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles -- we have the direction that all the males in Israel were to appear three times a year before Jehovah. This, in the antitype, would provide for freshness in the service of God. These verses read stress the feature of manhood, and the figure the Lord uses is to show that the instruction implied that the disciples should go through great pressure, but that it
{161}
would culminate in a man, or a state of manhood: hence the joy that a man is born into the world. The opening chapter of the Acts, indeed the endings of the gospels, contemplate manhood. Christianity did not begin with the babe stage; it began with manhood.
J.S. Is that the reason God created Adam, "Man"? We get the full thought first.
J.T. That is right, he was not a babe, he never was a babe or a boy; and his wife said of Cain, "I have acquired a man ..." (@Genesis 4:1) Babes are recognised later, especially in Exodus, but the introductory thought in Genesis is manhood. The service of God in Exodus contemplated the household; the passover stood in relation to the households of Israel, which included everyone in each; you eventually have that they all ate the same food and drank the same spiritual drink; so manhood is in view in the youngest babe in the household.
H.D.T. Does this scripture show that we arrive at manhood through pressure?
J.T. That is what I was thinking of in proposing it; the Lord had in mind that Christianity should begin in manhood, and that involved pressure, contemplated in the allegory here. He went through pressure supremely for us, but they *needed* it, and so now, the pressure that is upon us is to produce something; God has something in mind to be produced. There has been a good deal of instruction for us: light as to fellowship, the Lord's supper, and the service of God generally; the Lord has greatly helped the brethren, corresponding in a little measure with the light that the disciples had in company with Himself; but the pressure must come, you will not have the man without it.
H.D.T. You mean that this comes at the end of the instructions from chapter 13 to the end of chapter 16? Is pressure the way by which we come into the good of ministry?
{162}
J.T. Yes. It is largely through pressure. Of course, "Jacob's trouble" will involve the most awful pressure, but still it will culminate in manhood too. Israel will carry that thought out in the future, Christ will go through it with them in the character of David, and He will have His companions with Him on mount Zion, @Revelation 14:1 "These are they who follow the Lamb wheresoever it goes". That is manhood - a hundred and forty-four thousand standing with Him upon mount Zion, having His name and the name of His Father written upon their foreheads.
E.S.W. The manhood of Christ was not attained in this way. It was by virtue of His Person in manhood that He sustained the pressure. It says, in @Philippians 2:7,8, of Him, "taking his place in the likeness of men; and having been found in figure as a man, ... .". Would you say something about that?
J.T. Well, the first statement is that He appeared in ordinary guise as a Man, in the ordinary circumstances of men, in ordinary toil, and the like, but that is plural -- "in the likeness of *men (@Philippians 2:7)"*. It would mean that He did not take on any outward distinctive features in His incarnation; it was in the likeness of *men*, for God had no particular man in mind that He was the likeness of. He was in the likeness of men, which would represent their ordinary circumstances. He ate and drank and slept, and He worked as a carpenter -- a touching thing He had the ordinary lot of a man in that sense; sin apart at all times, but He took His place in that way. It was the divine thought that He should appear in that humble way: He emptied Himself, taking a bondman's form. Then, "having been found in figure as a man, he humbled himself" (@Philippians 2:8): that was what was suitable to manhood as in testimony. I should say it is a trait of manhood, according to God that one should humble himself, and become obedient; obedience belongs to manhood. Christ led the way in all this, and hence we
{163}
are enjoined: "let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus (@Philippians 2:5)".
E.S.W. I was just wondering if that is the standard, and if you would suggest that we reach manhood through pressure, as having the Lord before us in this way?
J.T. Pressure is needed for us, clearly. Philippians speaks of His manhood in contrast with Adam -- "did not esteem it an object of rapine to be on an equality with God ... (@Philippians 2:6)" The allusion there is to Adam, who aspired, through Satan's suggestion, to be like God, but the Lord had that already, and as having it. He took on a bondman's form.
C.S.S. The Psalmist says, "in pressure thou hast enlarged me", @Psalm 4:1. Jabez prays for enlargement and "God granted him that which he requested", (@1 Chronicles 4:10). That prayer would be pleasing to God.
J.T. Quite so, he got enlargement from God, "God brought about what he had requested". (@1 Chronicles 4:10)
J.S. Does *joy* play an important part here? Whilst the pressure is real, yet there is the "joy that a man has been born into the world".
J.T. Joy has a great place in these scriptures. That I hope will come into our inquiry. This thought of man is most important, especially now, because God has ordered pressure, and this affects the assembly, which is His supreme interest; the pressure is ordained of God to develop manhood. The thought was, that as the Lord arose He should find this, that there should be manhood, that the disciples should come into what is involved in this figure, have joy that a man was born. One can understand, as you take the facts presented in @Acts 1, how as in the upper room, the brethren would humbly look around on one another, and Peter might say to John, Bartholomew seems to be getting on very well now; and other names might be mentioned in the same connection: the progress being regarded as the
{164}
result of the terrible ordeal they had been through. They are now there in manhood. The account suggests a state -- of manhood, to which the Holy Spirit comes; the Holy Spirit coming in would sustain that and develop it in all that would follow; but the thought was there, in the upper room. Every interest of God would be treasured in those whose names are given as in the upper room. Those who saw the Lord go up to heaven go into the city; that is where true manhood was.
R.W. The Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward. Is that the thought of having a full stature?
J.T. Just so; the levitical side is present in the upper room, so that the time of the nursery had, in principle, passed. "The fulness of time" had come, the time appointed by the Father, they were in the state of manhood, and not in the nursery, the Lord left manhood here, and the pressure was the perfecting experience.
L.C.C. Is joy the result of seeing manhood developed in its varied features amongst the saints?
J.T. Well, you can see yourself how it appears in certain crises: how you can say that a certain brother is getting on -- the last sorrow he had was a finishing thing; the pressure had helped him.
J.W. Is manhood connected with "Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give you"? The Father answers men in this connection.
J.T. Well, the Lord had it in mind, "In that day ye shall ask in my name; and I say not to you that I will demand of the Father for you, for the Father himself has affection for you, because *ye* have had affection for me, and have believed that I came out from God", @John 16:27. The Lord goes on to say, "I came out from the Father and have come into the world; again, I leave the world and go to the Father. His disciples say to him. Lo, now thou speakest openly and utterest no allegory. Now we know that thou knowest all things,
{165}
and hast not need that any one should demand of thee. By this we believe that thou art come from God. Jesus answered them. Do ye now believe? Behold, the hour is coming, and has come, that ye shall be scattered, each to his own, and shall leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me (@John 16:28 - 32)". That would happen, and what is in mind here is that there should be manhood through the pressure occasioned by it. The beginning of the Acts shows that manhood was there, and joy consequent upon it.
M. Was it their companionship and their identification with Him that produced the pressure, and so developed the manhood?
J.T. Yes, they saw true manhood in Him, they accompanied Him; and when it was needed that an apostle should be appointed, the requirement was that he should be one of those who assembled with them during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among them, from the time of the baptism of John until He was received up. That, we may say, is the whole history of manhood in Christ down here, and the disciples were cognisant of it; the light had been in their souls, but the pressure brought the effect of it out. Left to themselves for a while after the Lord ascended, it was seen in them.
M. You said that manhood was there before the Holy Spirit came. One was inclined to think it was the Holy Spirit that produced manhood.
J.T. Manhood was there, Christ left it here. In us now it is by the Spirit, but the apostles and others who were with Him were formed in a special way while the Lord was here.
J.S.K. While the pressure may remain, the joy no one shall take from us, the Lord says, verse 22.
H.W. Is this the great point the apostle Paul had before him in his labours and conflict, to present every man perfect in Christ?
{166}
J.T. That is right -- every man perfect!
H.W. According to the apostle Paul's ministry it would involve their intelligent appreciation of the mystery.
J.T. It would. Paul makes much of manhood, he takes it up with the Corinthians; they were babes. He says, "I brethren, have not been able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly; as to babes in Christ. I have given you milk to drink, not meat, for ye have not been able, nor indeed are ye yet able; for ye are yet carnal"(@1 Corinthians 3:1 - 3); and, "we speak wisdom among the perfect (@1 Corinthians 2:6)". Hence the importance of selecting brothers to attend special meetings; the more advanced growths are the ones to be there, because there is thus more scope for the Spirit in them. There was very little scope for the Spirit in Corinth, but evidently there was in Ephesus; there is no limitation in Paul at Ephesus, for he was able to announce to the saints there "all the counsel of God", @Acts 20:27.
F.A.F. The expression here, *the* Father -- "I go to the Father"-would be a great one, would it not? The Person Himself, rather than the relationship. The relationship is there, but "the Father" implies God as revealed at the present moment.
J.T. He is revealed in that relation, that is John's way of presenting the truth. Of Christ, John says, "we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father(@John 1:14)". Then He is the only-begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father; that is that Person, as you say, but that Person in that relation, that is, it is God known in grace.
E.G.H. Do you suggest that assembly travail is necessary for the production of manhood?
J.T. Well, quite so. It really took that form, it was a collective thought, they all went through it; the Lord accredits them with having gone through it, and the man was the product, it is really what was there in the
{167}
way of love and intelligence in the apostles. Take the example of Peter in chapter 6, for instance: "Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast words of life eternal; and we have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God (@John 6:68,69)". That is a manly thought expressed, and no doubt the Lord valued it in that sense. Again, when the Lord says of Lazarus, "let us go to him", (@John 11:15) Thomas says, "Let us also go, that we may die with Him", (@John 11:16). That is manly. John gives you such touches. Yet the finishing thought was in the peculiar pressure of Gethsemane, involving Christ's death, and all the suffering connected with it; the Lord's activities on the first day of the week, after He arose, were to gather up all that. His appearing to those going to Emmaus brought it out, for they returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven and those with them gathered together. The Lord gathered up all the elements of manhood, and it was in the assembly, that is the idea. Luke gives the idea of the assembly, and John gives the *persons* who formed it; the Lord coming in, as Luke records, shows the assembly was there. And John's account, chapter 20, shows the message had gone in before the Lord, and when He came and stood in the midst, the disciples had the doors shut; legalism was shut out, Judaism was shut out. Their hearts were affected in that way-to the exclusion of the Jews, and the Lord came in, and they were glad to see Him. He says, "Peace be to you (@John 20:19)". They were required for a commission, as *He* had had a commission: "as the Father sent me forth, I also send you (@John 20:21)". He does not send out babes. He sends out men. All this instruction shows that in principle, at least, manhood was there.
E.G.H. The demanding or asking, is that the function of a man?
J.T. Yes, *demanding* indicates that manly qualities were there, speaking on equal terms, as it were.
M. What hindered the Hebrews from arriving at
{168}
this point? The apostle says, "when ... ye ought to be teachers, ye have again need that one should teach you", @Hebrews 5:12.
J.T. Well, manhood had been among them, they started with it. He enjoins them to remember their leaders, who had spoken to them the word of God. *They* were men, the reference being to the apostles.
H.D.T. Is there a possibility of having pressure without this being realised? @Hebrews 12 rather contemplates that they had sunk under it, without it being used to produce this with them. I suppose we may go through circumstances without the spiritual gain.
J.T. Hebrews would show that there had been plenty of pressure on those addressed, and hence circumstances for the development of manhood, but clearly the Jewish believers had not progressed. The contrary is the fact indicated. When they should have been teachers, they needed that one should teach them what are the elements of the beginning of the oracles of God. A babe, the writer says, is a person who partakes of milk and is unskilled in the word of righteousness; whereas full-grown men partake of solid food and on account of habit have their senses exercised for the discerning of good and evil. They began with the most perfect testimony to manhood, why did they degenerate from it?
F.W. Does growth enter into this at all?
J.T. It does, as we have been intimating. Perfect manhood was there in Christ, and the apostles grew up in relation to Him, and the pressure brought it to culmination. Thus as the Lord arose He gathered up all, and the results were seen on the first day of the week, John indicating that the meeting was late in the evening -- the suggestion would be of a full day's results. Correspondingly in @Acts 2 they were all together in one place, with one accord; there is no thought of discord at all, for there was manhood: the Holy Spirit came to*that*.
{169}
A.J.D. Does the whole service of God in Ephesians have this in view?
J.T. Exactly, "until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man (@Ephesians 4:13)". It is that we should be no longer babes; the working of the body, its self-building up in love, depends on this.
I should say that all pressure divinely ordered has manhood in view, but the Lord sometimes sends special pressure such as the present, and what will be the outcome of it? We may think of it at the moment as a disaster, but what will be the outcome for God? That is how we have to regard it. He may see the need of it among the saints, we have considerable light, but are we formed by it?
E.S.W. What you have been saying would indicate to us the necessity of cultivating the features of manhood before the pressure becomes severe, so that we may be enabled by that means, in subjection and patience, to go through it intelligently and be formed after Christ.
J.T. That is right, so that you do not give way in the pressure.
E.G.H. Is the thought of the woman here, in connection with the travail, to show it is not merely an acquirement of the mind, but it is a constitutional matter?
J.T. Yes. It is a maternal thought, having the result stated in mind. It dates back to the garden of Eden. Undoubtedly, the travail had manhood in mind when it was first imposed. When Cain was born. Eve said, "I have acquired a man with Jehovah (@Genesis 4:1)".
E.G.H. Asking the Father, verse 23 -- does that imply you are free from self-consideration and linked up with the interests of Christ? Is that manhood?
J.T. I think so. The Lord is intimating what manhood is all through here. "Verily, verily, I say to you, that ye shall weep and lament, ye, but the world shall
{170}
rejoice". Weeping and lamenting are elements belonging to manhood; the world rejoicing -- just the opposite. "And *ye* will be grieved, but your grief shall be turned to joy". That is transformation -- grief turned into joy. You do not take any short cuts when pressure is on, devices of your own to get out of it, and alleviate it by manipulation; you go *through* the thing. Your grief shall be turned into joy, that is complete transformation, it is a divine process. Grief turned into joy; thus we do not want to turn away from grief, it yields well!
A.J.D. Does that bring us into line with the thought of the new man?
J.T. Quite so; that is the process largely through which he is formed.
J.S. Do you think that in the manhood state we joy in tribulation because we know the results?
J.T. Well, that is what God works out after a person has peace with Him: "we have also access by faith into this favour in which we stand, and we boast in hope of the glory of God. And not only that, but we also boast in tribulations, knowing that tribulation works endurance; and endurance, experience; and experience, hope; and hope does not make ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us". That is, such a person has light, and does not want to be without any of these elements; they are *workers* for his blessing; and so you cannot afford to turn away from grief, for it turns into joy.
H.D. Is there any relation between this and the first sign -- the water turned into wine?
J.T. Well, quite so; the Lord says, "Fill the water-vessels with water. And they filled them up to the brim (@John 2:7)". I suppose water thus presented represents the full thought of cleansing in the believer; the Lord turns it into wine.
E.S.W. The grief here appears to be connected with
{171}
the consciousness of the absence of Christ - missing Him from this world, whereas joy is connected with His presence. "I will see you again", He says.
J.T. Quite so, "ye will be grieved" -- that would be because He would be arrested and taken away from them, and the sorrow connected with all that, but then that grief would be turned into joy.
C.T. In connection with the grief, it speaks of her joy. Would that connect with Philadelphia at all: it says, there, "*I* also will keep thee out of the hour of trial", @Revelation 3:10?
J.T. Well, yes; here the hour had come for them; it was an arranged thing, the Lord deliberately went to Gethsemane, He went *there;* it was the place of pressure; the word indicates it. He went into the place of pressure and He brought them with Him; He would have them to go through it, so He put some here, and some there, to watch. They go through the thing, but they do not go through it very well, but still the process went on, and something was accomplished.
C.S.S. The three men in the fire, @Daniel 3 - the Lord was with them.
J.T. He was with the disciples in the pressure, too. The Lord took them into Gethsemane; the word is not in John, but it is in Matthew and Mark. He went with them to the place, and there never was such an hour of pressure. "And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and deeply depressed", @Matthew 26:37. He had in mind that they should go through what He was going through; and there would be sorrow at His death. Think of the anxiety that they must have had, especially the women; the anxiety that they had when the Lord was actually dead! All this was in the Lord's mind when He spoke what we have read in @John 16.
F.W. Are we to look at assembly exercises and crises from this point of view?
{172}
J.T. I think so. We must have been through them to know what is implied. The Lord has graciously preserved us from great scatterings, for many years now, and it seems to me as though He allows *other* things, other heavy pressure, because we need such discipline, whatever the form it has. Scripture would indicate that we have to go through pressure if there is to be manhood, consolidated manhood.
F.W. You were remarking that we are not to take short cuts in order to modify or eliminate the pressure; matters have to be faced and gone through with God that Christ may be produced; is that the idea, and joy would be the result?
J.T. Quite so; Paul speaks about Christ being formed in the Galatians, but *he* had the travail, whereas they should have had it; he was travailing *again*, because of the retrogression; he wanted to bring them back into manhood.
E.S.W. The present crisis taken up rightly would tend to consolidate the saints, would it not? Internal dissensions tend to disrupt.
J.T. I believe that is what God has in mind, that the light we have been receiving should become *formative*, God helping us through the pressure.
H.D.T. Would you say that this section has the service of God in view, not only the testimony?
J.T. I would say the service of God the Father is in mind. So in chapter 17 He alludes to the saints as *men*. "I have manifested thy name to the men that thou gavest me out of the world". The Father's name is manifested: manifested in Christ; and He that hath seen Him hath seen the Father.
Rem. Seeing Him in manhood they saw the Father.
J.T. It required manhood in them to see what was there. So He said to Philip, "Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me,
{173}
Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father" (@John 14:9); manhood would discern that.
A.J.D. It is manifested in manhood, and therefore it is for men, for the formation of men.
J.T. Quite so; the Father came into their range in a Man, that is the idea; the Father's name is manifested.
F.I. When we come together "in assembly", I suppose we should be free of the pressure before we take on the service of God, because we would have the Lord in our midst.
J.T. Quite so. The pressure does not come into the heavenly service.
F.I. I was thinking that; I thought the pressure would touch us as individuals to bring us to manhood, so that when we come together "in assembly" we are able to take on the service of God.
J.T. That is right, and so in Nehemiah. In assembly service the pressure is not to be there; it is a spiritual state of things that we come into, and what is suitable to it should be carefully in mind, and all that is contrary eliminated. @Nehemiah 8:9 - 12 illustrates how sorrow is at a certain time prohibited: "And Nehemiah, that is, the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that explained to the people, said to all the people. This day is holy to Jehovah your God: mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept when they heard the words of the law. And he said to them. Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions to them for whom nothing is prepared; for the day is holy to our Lord; and be not grieved, for the joy of Jehovah is your strength. And the Levites quieted all the people, saying. Be still! for the day is holy; neither be grieved. And all the people went their way, to eat and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great rejoicing. For they had understood the words that were declared to them". That is a feature of manhood, that you understand what governs a particular position, and
{174}
you eliminate all else. Grief would be right otherwise, but not here.
J.S-k. Would you say the assembly coming together is on the ground of resurrection -- that could not admit grief?
J.T. Well, we do not come together exactly on the ground of resurrection, we come together in the wilderness, but we come together in the power of the Spirit as anointed. We are thus enabled, as understanding what is suitable to a given time, to eliminate all that is not suitable, hence we are not to carry our griefs in there. We are to leave them outside, the Spirit enabling us to do so, that we may be entirely free for the assembly, and ready to receive impressions that are for the assembly; and joy is one of the leading things -- the disciples were *glad* when they saw the Lord.
E.G.H. The thought of the Lord is that we should all be joyful. In chapter 3 there is the bridegroom's voice; it brings in joy, and then we come on to chapter 16 -- manhood: is it completed in chapter 17?
J.T. The Lord gathers it all up in His prayer. These elements that you allude to, build us up to this. It is remarkable how much of joy we have in the Scriptures! Here it is on account of the fact that a Man has been born into the world, the Lord extending it to the disciples: "but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one takes from you"; and again, "ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full", verse 24. I believe all enters into the assembly, that the service is to be a joyous occasion, suitable to the Lord. One says, "how I went on with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, a festive multitude", (@Psalm 42:4). To come into the assembly with a downcast countenance and a heavy heart, is not honouring to the Lord.
F.I. The basis of our coming "together in assembly"
{175}
depends upon the glorification of Christ, and we being occupied with Him in the place where He is, there would be no sense of pressure or sorrow; we should be filled with His glory.
J.T. Quite so. So throughout the closing chapters of the gospels that is what you find, the relief that the pressure has gone, and it is now joyousness in the power of the Spirit, and that is what the Lord is looking for.
G.H. The Lord when He met some of His disciples on the resurrection morning said "Hail!" -- I understand that means "O joy".
J.T. He said simply, "Hail!" Yes, joy would enter into the primary meaning and agrees with what is before us. The Lord is, as it were, saluting them. Mark gives the darkest picture: at first the disciples did not seem equal to anything as the Lord rose from the dead; even the women are unequal to the position, they are full of fear; but in John's gospel the disciples are *glad* when they see the Lord, they are ready for it.
T.S.McG. When that end is reached, is joy ministered to the heart of God?
J.T. Well, joy suitable to the assembly will result in praise to God. Of course, as soon as you return to ordinary circumstances there will be trials to face, but in the assembly it is dishonouring to God to bring in these depressed conditions.
A.J.D. There is an issue to pressure when we come together in assembly, so that God can get His portion.
J.T. Yes; we are able by the Holy Spirit to lay aside what would hinder, although right in other circumstances. The assembly is the divine residence by the Spirit.
J.S-k. Whilst it is in wilderness conditions, we have power to come together in liberty. We have power to lay aside the grief and all else that occupies us in the
{176}
ordinary sense, we come in "from amongst the dead", so to speak.
J.T. We get on to resurrection ground, as you said, and heavenly ground, too, but the Lord's supper is neither; it is in the wilderness, where Christ is not, that is the idea. If He comes in as the risen Man and the heavenly Man, that is where the ground is changed. We come together in the wilderness, but we come together *before* He comes.
T.S.McG. We remember Him as away.
J.T. That is right; we are where He is not, but as soon as He comes in, the ground is changed in principle. Then it requires that we should be brought to His side, so that we are with Him, entering into His thoughts and affections and responding to them. We have to understand that when He comes in, the ground is changed; it may take time for us to come to it, that we should be amenable to Him, but the principle governing the position should be accepted at once.
J.S-k. I had in mind Caleb and Joshua - when they were in the wilderness they carried the thought of the land in their minds.
J.T. Yes. You may have the greatest riches in your treasury, but you do not bring them all out at once, you bring out what is suitable to the wilderness position first, and when the other phases come in, you are ready for them; but in no phase has grief any place, it is to be left outside altogether.
F.W.W. The dominical side of the supper would help us in appreciating deliverance from what is adverse.
J.T. You mean the authority of the Lord; quite so; and I believe that the reference to the new covenant in the Lord's supper is to augment that, that whilst the authority of the Lord is there, there is *liberty:* "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty,(@2 Corinthians 3:17)" but it is still the Spirit of the *Lord* -- authority is there.
E.S.W. Would you say more as to the exclusion of
{177}
Judaism by the new covenant? What form would Judaism be likely to take amongst us as gathered together for the service of God?
J.T. Well, when the Lord sat down with His disciples at the time He introduced the supper, they would be held by Jewish principles, they would stand in that relation, and so it is now. There is much Judaism now; many of us have come out of human organisations, and Judaism is the principle in them, if not heathendom and idolatry; therefore we are apt to bring that into the assembly; and I think the idea of the new covenant is to wither that up. In earlier days brothers coming in to break bread used to kneel down individually and pray. Well, that was a religious habit, that was Judaism; and other such evidences of Judaism were recognised. Well, the new covenant enables us to lay all that aside; it is not necessary to the service of God. You come in by the power of the Spirit, and sit down. The Lord *placed* Himself at table, @Luke 22:14; that is an example, we are to be there suitably.
C.S.S. Would not a prayer meeting also be a scene of joy?
J.T. @Isaiah 56:7 says so: Jehovah says, I will "make them joyful in my house of prayer". Further, "in thy presence is fulness of joy, at thy right hand ... pleasure for ever more (@Psalm 16:11)". As already quoted, the Psalmist says, "I went on with them to the house of God, ... a festive company (@Psalm 42:4)". Even the thought of the house gives joy.
H.D.T. In the Acts, after the apostles had suffered, and were feeling the pressure of things, they lifted up their voice in prayer to God, and according to His promise He made them joyful in His house of prayer @Acts 4:23 - 35.
K.A.A. Is the end of this exercise seen in the glory in the last scripture read?
J.T. It was in mind that we should touch on that,
{178}
@John 17:22 - 24: "And the glory which thou hast given me I have given them, that they may be one, as we are one; I in them and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and that thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me. Father, as to those whom thou hast given me, I desire that where I am they also may be with me, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me, for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world". Your thought is that these glories here are to occasion joy?
The Lord begins with the word "men", those the Father gave him; they had kept His word; they were really men, because that is a trait of manhood. "They were thine, and thou gavest them me, and they have kept thy word". What He says of them indicates plainly that they were men from His point of view. And He further says, "And the glory which thou hast given me I have given them, that they may be one, as we are one", verse 22; and then He asks that we should be with Him, to see the glory that the Father has given Him, verse 24.
N.K.M. Would you say another word as to that glory?
J.T. Well, it seems to be peculiar to Himself, connected with the love with which the Father loved Him before the world was. It is a glory which links on, I think, with the glory which He had along with the Father before the world was. It is evidently a glory only to be *seen* by the saints, not shared, as connected with the love wherewith the Father loved Him before the world was.
H.D.T. Could it be described as a connecting link between His place in Deity and His place in manhood for eternity?
J.T. It seems so; it seems that whilst we cannot compass it, we can see the link between Him in manhood
{179}
and what He is in Deity, because in verse 5, it is Deity: the glory that He had along with the Father before the world was. The saints are brought to the edge of abstract Deity, of infinitude. We cannot compass it, of course but we know it is there; we are conscious of that. It is most touching that the link is practical, for the Lord says, "I desire that where I am they also may be with me, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me, for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world". That is, a thought that existed before the foundation of the world is linked up with what we *see*. I think the language is to develop love, as the medium through which we come into the greatest things.
F.I. Does it give emphasis to what is said later -- "the love wherewith thou hast loved me"?
J.T. Well, I should think so, that that might be in us, you get some little glimpse of it in that we realise something of the love wherewith the Father loves the Son, for that love is to be in the saints.
E.R.C. Is the development of intelligence and love involved in manhood?
J.T. Yes; we may have in our minds the idea of an impassable gap between us and abstract Deity, but I do not think that is intended to be conveyed in scripture. I think love is the link, and whilst we are still creatures we have access to what is infinite, we are conscious of it; for our Priest has "become higher than the heavens,(@Hebrews 7:26)" and that belongs to the realm of Deity.
M. The Lord makes much of unity in that particular passage, saying, "that they all may be one".
J.T. Well, that is part of the great divine scheme. We were saying lately that the mystery involves immensity; all the saints from Pentecost to the coming of the Lord are included in it. The measurements in @Revelation 21 indicate its largeness, but they are symbolic, you cannot follow them literally, a solid cube
{180}
of persons, viewed thus; it is a spiritual thought, a substantial thought. But the mystery involves all saints from Pentecost to the coming of the Lord; it is one organically, meaning that everyone is in his place. Think of the vastness of it! Myriads of saints all functioning in relation to one another, not merely so man persons, but an organism, all functioning in relation to one another; it is beyond anything that has ever been suggested, the creation is secondary to it. How vast it is! and wonderfully formed, too; it is formed of persons, persons contemplated in this chapter; men who are one, made one in love and intelligence. We are to be one through the glory that He has given us, the glory the Father has given Him. The brethren would do well to ponder the vastness of it and the quality and variety of its composition and formation. How can I fit in it? I can function, perhaps, in the local features of it, but can I fit in and function in the heavenly city as presented in the Scriptures? I believe all this is in mind in the Lord's prayer here: "that they may be one, as we are one; I in them and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one and that the world may know that thou has sent me"; and again, "And I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known; that the love with which thou has loved me may be in them and I in them".
H.D.T. Would you say a word on the thought of "in" -- as thou, "Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us"?
J.T. I think the preposition would imply operation. The Father and the Son are operating. I think these verses involve the mystery. There is a great operative mind controlling it; all worked out in love.
H.D.T. "I in them", verse 26. Is it thus that He makes known to them the Father's name? He says "and will make it known; that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them". That
{181}
is, entering into the sense of what is seen in the Father in relation to Himself; and we have part in it.
J.T. That is right, the love being in us gives us scope in relation to Him. Hence the prayer of the apostle Paul "that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts, being rooted and founded in love", (@Ephesians 3:17). The love being there, there is scope for His operations.
A.J.D. You were saying we are brought near to abstract Deity in this chapter. Would that be that we are brought into all the fulness of God?
J.T. Well, @John 17:5 connected with verse 24, to which we were referring, links the glory that we are to see in Christ with the Father's love for Him before the foundation of the world. It was suggested that our nearness as with Christ, verse 24, and the glory that we behold is because of love and its operation. The glory which Christ had with the Father before the world was, and the love which the Father had for the Son before the world was, are linked together; and the glory which we are to see as with Him stands in that connection. There is immense privilege for the saints and richness of thought generally in these wonderful verses.
H.D.T. Paul in Ephesians 3:20 says, "to him that is able to do ..." There is power to bring us into these things.
J.T. Just so. It is according to the power which works in us.
{182}
FAITH'S OUTLET FROM PRESSURE
@Luke 21:19, @1 Thessalonians 4:4
These short verses are selected from the Lord's own words and also from the words of His great servant Paul; they deal first with our souls and secondly with our bodies. There is also a third great component part of man -- his spirit, which shall have a place in my remarks; but I am thinking particularly of our souls and our bodies. Our spirits have the greatest place, being first mentioned in the order in which the Spirit refers to our three component parts: "Your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ (@1 Thessalonians 5:23)". Our spirits are mentioned first. Evidently the greatest component part of man is his spirit. He gets it directly from God according to Ecclesiastes, and the Lord alludes to it as to Himself. He commended His spirit to His Father, a most impressive reference to the perfection of His manhood, not that He had a spirit other than Himself. Whilst He was really Man, He was *uniquely so*, having existence before His manhood, which does not apply to any of us. Becoming Man, He is Himself His Spirit, for He tells the thief that he should be with Him in paradise. They were both going there that day, not through resurrection, but through disembodiment for the moment, but they were both men in that sense. Jesus was as really man as the thief, having a spirit as a man, too, but it was Himself. Coming into manhood He became His own spirit, taking on other component parts of humanity. Personally He never ceases to be God, but yet He is Man, but His Spirit is Himself, as my spirit is myself, but I receive my spirit from God. He was God and came into humanity here. He was personally a divine Person and became His own spirit
{183}
in manhood, so that it was Himself. "Today shalt thou be with me in paradise (@Luke 23:43)".
I refer to this to make the matter clear as to Christ, so that we should not have the erroneous thought that He had a spirit besides Himself. Incarnation is the thought presented in scripture; that is, "the Word became flesh"(@John 1:14) -- a divine Person taking human condition. He was His own spirit, and yet as in manhood, He was really Man. He felt as we do, sin apart, committed His spirit unto God, to His Father; as Stephen did in committing his spirit to Jesus, saying, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit (@Acts 7:59)". You can see therefore how great the thought of spirit is in manhood, especially in Christ. It is Himself. It is inscrutable that He should be so compressed, and it touches the heart, but He never ceases to be Himself. He is Himself always. Yet coming into manhood He compresses Himself and speaks as a man, feels as a man, using the words "My spirit", and "My soul", and "My body". He "emptied himself, taking a bondman's form", @Philippians 2:7. Referring to our "whole spirit, and soul, and body, (@1 Thessalonians 5:23)" what is important for us all, in view of what has been remarked, is to understand the analysis described in @Romans 7, by which we are enabled to discern inwardly the difference between each -- what the spirit is and what the soul is. The body is simple, it is material, but the difference between soul and spirit is not so simple; and in addition to that the mind, and other elements in us which are subsidiary to what I am saying. The three main thoughts are the spirit, the soul, and the body, and the analysis in @Romans 7 enables us to discern them. The one who describes it apparently went through it before he had the Holy Spirit, but now it is by the Holy Spirit that we are enabled to make the analysis. It is our privilege to do so now. The matter has been gone through experimentally at least by one, and the facts are stated in the clearest manner.
{184}
It results in one coming to his ego, that is, he comes to himself. "I myself", not simply "I". "I" is the ego, but "I myself" is the ego in consciousness, and, in saying that, he is in control of his mind, "So then I myself with the mind serve God's law" (@Romans 7:25). So that he is now morally right. He has arrived at the distinction between sin in the flesh and himself. It is a moral point that he reaches. It is most important. Unless we reach the moral result in the process, we miss the gain of it. Never shall we reach the divine end at all, unless we have the moral element in our minds. "When we were in the flesh" (@Romans 7:5) is a moral allusion; not flesh and blood, but flesh as the thing which is the result of sin in man. It could not be so viewed in any other being but man. Having gone through the thing, we can say that the result of our investigations inwardly is that with the mind we serve God's law. That is a moral result and resolution. I may say here that none of us is of much account unless we learn to make resolutions before God. This is a definite resolution. "I myself with the mind serve God's law" (@Romans 7:25). Through the process we arrive at these component parts. I am able to speak of my spirit, and my soul, and my body.
In Hebrews we learn that the word of God divides asunder between soul and spirit; it is so piercing, so sharp. It discerns between soul and spirit; the discernment is in me by the word -- discerning between soul and spirit, and joints and marrow. I am speaking now of the ability that the word of God gives me to distinguish. So Mary the mother of our Lord, in beautiful reference to her growth in the things of God (and who in her day had such opportunities?) says, "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour", (@Luke 1:46,47). She had learnt to distinguish. Before anyone had gone through the experience of @Romans 7 she had learnt to distinguish between soul and spirit. She was a worshipper, but an
{185}
intelligent one, a balanced one. In fact, you can scarcely get anything more balanced than the sentence I quoted from Mary's note of worship in @Luke 1. Balance is needed in all things, but in the things of God particularly; much is made of weight and measure in regard of the things of God. Weight and measure imply balance.
As regards this passage in Luke 21, I wish to impress all with the need of keeping our souls at the present time -- always of course -- but particularly at the present time when externally the whole atmosphere is disturbed. It is not a religious attack by the devil which is current, not that he is ever idle as regards what is of God directly, but this is an indirect attack on what God is doing. The current situation in the world is an indirect attack of the devil on the service and work of God. I lay that down as my judgment, but I am assured that I am right, and it is what I have in mind, for our souls are apt to be disturbed and deranged; and if they are, we will not be able to say with Mary, "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour" (@Luke 1:46,47). If she had been disturbed by current public events she would not have been able to say that. Think of the course of public events which ensued. Think of Luke's account of the Lord's remarkable discourse from which I have read -- there are three accounts of it. His discourse on prophetic events bearing on the last days. The Lord alludes, for instance, to Jerusalem. He says. "When ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh (@Luke 21:20)". As any Christian at Jerusalem at the time looked out on the Roman armies encircling the city, how depressing it would be! That would be the effect of it, and Satan would have in mind that every saint in Jerusalem should be affected by it, but the Lord tells them what to do. There can be no question that the enemy would depress them. How could the service of God go on with these brethren
{186}
in Jerusalem in those days, if they were overwhelmed and filled with apprehension because of the terrible things that were happening. They would remember the Lord's words, "And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh" (@Luke 21:20). He Himself had anticipated it, as seen in chapter 19. He wept over Jerusalem, reminding them of what the Romans would do. He was not without feelings, without a soul, but in weeping over it He was completely above the sorrow in His own spirit. In the darkest period of His life He was happy in spirit. When the time of His rejection was apparent He "rejoiced in spirit". That is the idea, dear brethren, to be above things.
This chapter is full of such things as would depress and distress and derange our whole moral being. In the verses previous to that which I read, the Lord had been speaking of the terrible persecutions which the saints themselves will endure. We cannot speak of that now, because the attack is not directly upon us. There is practically no persecution now in the sense in which the Lord was speaking, save in a few parts of the earth. I should not make little of the persecution in certain countries, for apostasy has set in, and the saints are suffering, but generally speaking the attack is not against us, it is indirectly against us and against God and against Christ, but it is not direct. Still, we know what the consequences are likely to be, although God is keeping His hand over the position, and we are apt to be unduly affected. Hence the word here, "In your patience *possess ye* your souls". See to that. See that they are yours really. I must see that I *have* my soul, that I have it myself, that it is under my control. I gain it in patience, it is my own; for it *may* slip away, becoming disconcerted and deranged and I may lose the sense of the divine Presence and fail to answer to God in service. Hence the idea of patience, not ignoring
{187}
the pressure, but patience in it and gaining our souls. Not that we have not got them. Everybody has his soul in a sense, but I may have a thing and fail in its use so that it is not functioning, according to the divine appointment. It may be influenced adversely.
How am I to gain it, possess it? In "patient endurance". I see this to be one of the most important matters of the present time. It is inevitable that we must to some extent observe what is happening, but what about my being? What about my spirit, my soul, and my body? I am responsible for them, and I am to hold them for their proper purpose according to divine appointment. In the midst of these throes in @Luke 21 our Lord introduces this terse but forcible remark, "In your patience possess ye your souls". Patience is one of the great features of Christianity. It implies waiting, but waiting enduringly, not in a mere theoretic way, saying, The Lord is coming and things will be set right: without our showing the slightest evidence that we really feel these things, that they are verities to us. We can be full of theories of that kind, and pick up remarks of others, but the Lord is concerned here about the soul - the state of my soul, as to whether I *possess* it. That is, feeling current happenings in the world, whatever they may be, but going through them, possessing my soul in going through them. It is my property, and I am keeping it so that it functions according to God. That is why we are told, "gird up the loins of your mind (@1 Peter 1:13)". It is an important thing to keep the mind right. Girding alludes to a girdle round the loins. The allusion is to keeping things under control. They are not lightly strewn about, scattered with every wind, affected by every happening, but you have your mind, also your soul and your spirit, under control.
James speaks about patience, the proving of our faith works it, chapter 1:3,4. How important it is! "Be patient therefore, brethren, @James 5:7" he says, and again, "Ye
{188}
have heard of the endurance of Job, and seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is full of tender compassion and pitiful @James 5:11". James would make it very real to us. Indeed it was pending the destruction of Jerusalem that he said that. Possibly he was in the city, anyway he wrote in view of it, "Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord, @James 5:7". He would make it very real. So he speaks of one purposing to visit a certain place to traffic and get gain, and spending a year there. He condemns the trading spirit that leaves God out of its reckonings, instead of saying. If the Lord should so will, and we should live, we will also do this or that. That makes our dependence on the Lord very real. The will of the Lord is in my soul every moment. These two things go together: If the Lord will and I should live, I shall do so and so. I am balanced, I am kept right as to everything. Not that we should not calculate as to our affairs. James owns this, but insists that we bring in these two elements, then you are having to do with the Lord momentarily. You are thinking of the *possibility* of dying because your body is still mortal, so that you are kept in the attitude of constant dependence. And then have patience in all this; do not be irritable in it, do not be disappointed. Exercise patience, for "patience [worketh] experience; and experience, hope; and hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us(@Romans 5:4,5)". How real and assured that makes our lives!
As regards current matters, there is pressure, but then God is working through *pressure*. If He is to work, if there is to be formation, there has to be intelligent recognition of what He is doing, not a mere abstract or theoretic allusion to this and that, but I am with God in what He is doing; He is in operation and I know what He is doing. That is the idea. I know what His end is and I hold myself for Him, I am material for His
{189}
formation; I am in His hand as the Potter. Such an attitude implies my intelligence and knowledge. God has me now as "clay", that is to say, I am suitable for His work, for the great end He has in mind, valuing it; thus the work goes on. So the Lord says, "In your patience possess ye your souls". On this line I have my soul; it refers to affection. The spirit is more my link with God. Through my soul I reach men -- rivers of living water flow out through my soul. Thus I must have my soul kept, possessed in a real way, so that it is functioning. What a thing it is to be in this world with all the terrible influences that are at work, and to possess one's soul, so that it functions. It implies purified affections Godward and manward. It also enters into the service of God. "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour (@Luke 1:46,47)".
The second part of my subject is the body, more easily dealt with because it is physical, the verses selected are from the passage written by the apostle to the Thessalonians in regard to what was so common among the heathen -- fornication. The Spirit of God makes much of our bodies, and here it is in a very concrete way. Possess your vessel, he says. "That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour". It is what I have. Just as I have a soul, I have a body. It is that in which I am visible to others, that in which all the senses function; it is called a vessel. The whole man is a vessel according to other passages. The believer is a vessel -- spirit, soul, and body -- he needs them all for the full thought of God. It is said of us that we are vessels of mercy prepared for glory. What a thought that is! It includes our bodies. It also includes our spirits and our souls. But we are prepared for glory. So the body is sown in dishonour, but is raised in glory. That is the physical side. It is called in Philippians, a body of humiliation, and it
{190}
is well to accept that it is so. We cover and ornament it, but it is still a vessel of humiliation. The word is not "vile", as it is translated in the authorised version, but it is "body of humiliation", and the Lord Jesus is coming, we are told, to transform it "into conformity to his body of glory (@Philippians 3:21)" -- one of the finest thoughts! The greatest thought as to our bodies. Not only like His body in resurrection, but His body *of glory*. Think of the magnificence of this -- that our bodies should be conformed to the image of His body of glory. The preparation is going on now, but not in our bodies; there is no formation at all in our bodies, the formation refers to the moral side; we are being prepared according to the statement, "which he had afore prepared unto glory (@Romans 9:23)".
You say, prepared for heaven, but I think "prepared for glory" is a greater thought; that I am capable of taking on glory, and having part in glory; I am equal to it. You do not want to be behind in any glorious display in the coming day. That is what is in mind. You do not want to be behind, for there are going to be wonderful displays of glory. The idea of glory involves what is public. It is what is manifested. Think of the magnificence of the thought! We have the word *weight* attached to it. "An exceeding weight of glory (@2 Corinthians 4:17)". We need ability to support that. If I am called to be alongside of Jesus, the King of glory, the Lord of glory then I need power to support me there, to be equal to sustaining the weight of that. Think of the weight that a king has on him, or any personage in the place of government. It is glory, but with weight attaching to it. I want to be equal to the great displays which are presently to take place. When He shall appear we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is. Paul says He is going to make our bodies like His body of glory. @Hebrews 2:10 says, "For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing
{191}
many sons unto glory ..." We want to have in mind to be ready for the glory, to be capable of sustaining glory, for that side of the truth is stressed in scripture.
I have turned aside to speak of @Romans 9 as regards every one of us as vessels of mercy prepared for glory, because it includes the whole of man, the whole tripartite being -- spirit, soul, and body. I have been speaking of the spirit and soul, but I am speaking now of the body, and all that to which I have just immediately been referring reflects backwards on the use I make of my body at the present time. It is a vessel. The fact that it is mortal does not at all detract from that. Abstractly*it* remains. The body of the believer, with his spirit and soul, is to be "preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ", (@1 Thessalonians 5:23). It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body; and if alive at the coming of the Lord, the believer's body will be quickened, @Romans 8:11. What I am speaking in now, what I am acting in now, what I am expressing myself in now, will remain, only it will take on another condition. It must remain. The whole man goes through. Thus what I am to be, is intended to reflect on what I am now. Hence, as a vessel, how am I using it? Let each one "possess his vessel in sanctification and honour": possess it in the midst of a world of corruption, for Christendom in this respect is little better than heathendom.
It is most important that we should have this before us, that our bodies are vessels to be held in sanctification and honour. One could speak much of the few verses before and after this passage, as to what is said of the unfairness and evil generally of fornication, especially as to how the marriage vow is violated in the most lawless way. It is gracious of the Spirit of God to put the thing on such a level as is found in this passage. Let us hold our vessels "in sanctification and honour". And in order to show how this comes about Romans
{192}
develops the doctrine of it; it enters into chapter 8. I have been speaking of chapter 9 as relating to the vessel, the whole man; but in chapter 8 among many other things the apostle says, "If Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin (@Romans 8:10)". That is, it is because of that, the terrible thing -- that which the body is capable of, what is expressed through the body. If Christ gets in there. He will deal with it. Let Him in then. Surely He is entitled to an entrance. "If Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin", (@Romans 8:10). It is not that sin has made it dead; it is because Christ is there that it has become dead. Christ makes it dead because of this terrible thing that works in it; that it ceases to act -- and then "the Spirit is life (@Romans 8:10)". That is, if Christ has a place at all, and one can hardly be regarded as a Christian unless he gives Christ a place, then the Spirit is life in view of righteousness, on account of righteousness. That is to say, Christ deals with the sin, so that there should be life by the Spirit, and righteousness. When He comes into the world presently He will deal with the whole matter in a most drastic and effective way. But He is doing that with me now. The Christian in principle is the millennium. He represents the way by which the millennium comes about. Thus if Christ has a place in me, I have part in the blessings of the coming world. My body is dead. It has ceased to act in relation to sin, ceased to respond to sin. I have come to see the value of my body, that it is to be an instrument of righteousness. Take the gospels -- as Christ comes into any of the instances brought forward, the matter is dealt with, it is settled. "The Spirit is life because of righteousness", (@Romans 8:10) that is, on account of righteousness. It is life in view of righteousness. There should be righteousness in the person. Righteousness in the believer is in the power of life. What a transformation that is!
So as to confirm this the apostle goes on to say, "if
{193}
the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you" (@Romans 8:11) -- note that word "dwell". Think of becoming a dwelling-place of the Spirit of God! Then, "he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you (@Romans 8:11)". Note that it does not say *Raise* our mortal bodies, here. It is quickening. It is to bring out the point of responsibility; our bodies viewed thus are alive, not in their graves. The point is that the believer will be changed or quickened on account of God's Spirit which dwells in him. But it is "the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus (@Romans 8:11)". Think of the love that entered into the resurrection of Jesus. You say. It was the *power* of the Father, but it says, "he was raised up from the dead by the *glory* of the Father"(@Romans 6:4) -- one of the most wonderful passages. It is the glory of love, it is the shining out of love, the love that the Father had for the Son. He raised Him up by His glory. He was enveloped in glory and taken out from among the dead. What a wonderful matter it was on that day when the Father reached forth in the infinitude of His love and took the Object of it out of the grave. Jesus died and went into the earth and the Father waited until three days and three nights were completed. H might have done it before, but He waited until the three days and three nights were completed before gratifying his love. But when the three days and three nights were passed He raised His beloved Son. He took Him up out of the grave, and so it is "the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus (@Romans 8:11)". That is, Christ as a Man in all His attractiveness to God. He also raised Him because of the testimony, which is implied here in the title "Christ". So that there is a dual thought in it He quickens us because of our personal attractiveness to Him and also because of our part in the testimony. We do not want to be behind in that. Christ has part in the testimony. That is what He came into manhood
{194}
for, and He carries it through and I want to be with Him -- you want to be with Him. All this enters into the idea of the quickening of our bodies. What a triumph! Men and women quickened as it were on the spot, quickened where they worked, where they lived, where they glorified God in their bodies. How glorious to be looking for this, to bring it into daily exercise, so that the thing is always with you. They are not mere platitudes and theories. The Spirit who has raised up Christ is dwelling in you -- how real that is! Not merely that you see Him above by faith, but He is dwelling in you and the testimony is going on. In the saints thus viewed, delightfulness to God goes on every day, and when the moment comes, each will be quickened where he serves. So that you can see the importance of what I am saying as to practical Christianity and deliverance and victory day by day in the presence of the present pressure which, in the government of God, has come upon all the earth.
{195}
ROOTS
@Mark 4:16,17; @Isaiah 37:30 - 32; @Daniel 4:15,16; @Colossians 2:6,7
These scriptures speak about *roots*. It is thought to speak about them; first to call attention to persons who, although they have received the gospel, have not gone on in the truth of it, not having root in themselves. The initial idea in the proclamation of the gospel is the sowing of seed, as the parable teaches in the chapter in Mark from which I read. The idea is that in the reception of the word of God there is not a drawing back, but a going forward; that is, "faith, to the saving of the soul (@Hebrews 10:39)". Matthew and Mark point out that there are four kinds of ground into which the seed of the word of God through the gospel falls. What is said of this kind, called rocky ground, contemplates that the individual who received the word proceeds for a time. Many would regard them as genuine, hopeful, possible, or probable material for further development of features of the work of God; but there is something amiss. There is no root. Job speaks of the root of a matter being in one. That is the first phase of my subject.
The second is in Isaiah, where we have a remnant, having peculiar application to the present time. It takes root downwards. The right principle is already in them, and, becoming active, it takes root downwards, that is, to the point whence sap is drawn.
Thirdly, we have in @Daniel 4 a person under severe discipline. He is genuine, and the figure used is of a tree cut down, not that it falls, but is cut down, and "the stump of its roots" remains in the earth, with a band of iron and brass upon them, implying limitations.
Then, fourthly, the saints viewed in the Colossian state are enjoined to be "rooted and built up in him"
{196}
-- in Christ. These are the four features of what was in mind.
The first, as already intimated, contemplates shallow, unfruitful, uncertain, nominal believers; a bane to the spiritual who carry things for God, who build up the saints. They find such material, I may say, impossible It is not that I would eliminate anyone here from the realm of divine operations, that is, where the Spirit is actually operating. It is a wonderful thing to be in that realm. There is a mighty current always present, particularly in occasions of this kind, of which the Lord says, "Gather the people together, and I will give them water (@Numbers 21:16)". The saints gathered together thus, or moving in this direction, are pleasing to the eye of God. Some of those of whom I have spoken may be here, carried along by others in the right current. As here, you are where God is working, but up till now there has been no evidence of root. You are in acquiescence with certain forms, adopting certain language that is in itself right, and yet discrediting those who are concerned about your souls.
There are those who watch for our souls, and we should thank God for them. But in the cases I referred to souls are looked after, and those who do so find no clear evidence of genuineness; there is always an elusiveness so that your motives cannot be fathomed, and whilst you are outwardly among the saints, yet there is a constant uncertainty. You may not have been tested yet. The persecution may not have arisen in your case, but when it does, if you proceed as you are now, you will fall away. Something will offend you. You will be no more with the brethren, no more to be seen. The secret is, no root in yourself. It may be that it never occurred to you that if you analyse your moral being you could find a root if it were there. There are roots, you may be sure. Roots of bitterness are in such people. The love of money is apt to be there, and that
{197}
is a most extensive, extraordinary root -- a root of all evil. It is a remarkable statement. Any of the class I have spoken of that may be present is sure to have that root, and if you look in you will find it is there. All your calculations are on that line. You would like to have more and still more, disregarding, perhaps, the accumulated evil that goes with that. You may not meet it for the moment, but presently it will appear. "The love of money is the root of all evil (@1 Timothy 6:10)". It is sure to be where the divine root is absent.
Nothing can be more serious and solemn than as one investigates he finds the absence of the divine root. It exists in others, but not in you. It is a time therefore for looking into matters and seeing how the root is in others. They are not like you. Why should you be different from the people of God? Why should you not find the divine way and take it? If you have discovered a lack of this kind, there are others who have what you have not. Why not inquire from them? They are ready to tell you. If you consult the Lord (and He is ready to be consulted at any time), as Paul said "the Lord will give thee understanding in all things", (@2 Timothy 2:7), He has means of communicating His mind to you. He will make His mind known through your parents, your brothers and sisters, and others. The Lord is ready at any moment to communicate His mind, to give you understanding, to give it to *you*. Why not seek it? "The Lord will give *thee* understanding (@2 Timothy 2:7)". In earlier days He could say to a needy soul. Consult My servant John -- he will tell you; Paul will tell you. Today there are those whom He likewise can use to help you, your parents, if Christians, as I said, can instruct you in the way of God, as also your brother or your sister. There is no excuse at all if you remain in ignorance of the gospel. The Lord has set around you the means of light and understanding.
Why, then, I say to you young people, should you
{198}
be uncertain? Why should you be indefinite? Why not look into matters and see what is in the way? Why are other roots with you and not this one; the root in yourself, in virtue of which the word of God becomes operative; the root by which you are constituted honest, having an honest and good heart; a root which constitutes you good ground on which the word falls and bears fruit thirty, sixty, or a hundred fold? This is within your reach. As you face these things it is certain that the Lord will come in for you. You must see that the divine root is in yourself, as Mark makes plain in the passage read. That is what he is saying to you through me tonight. It is a question of what is in yourself, constituting you good ground, as I said. It is not in nature. God affects you by His Spirit, so that you receive His word and yield the fruit of it in "an honest and good heart (@Luke 8:15)". He has been endeavouring to work in you in this sense, but you have stood in the way. You have allowed the other roots to bear fruit, disregarding what is of God. The gospel may have been received, but, persecution on account of it arising, you became offended and bore no fruit. Such being the case you soon find excuses; you are no more at the meetings; no more Bible reading; no more prayers; Satan has secured you. The secret of this is the want of uprightness of heart, and not allowing the Lord to have His way in your soul. He is speaking to you now. The Spirit of God is saying that henceforth it must *not* be said of you. No root in himself, and hence no fruit for God -- because you have submitted to His work.
Coming to Isaiah, it is a time of crisis, of great pressure, such as the world is enduring now. Sennacherib had attacked Judah with overwhelming numbers. It is a time of pressure and I am persuaded, dear brethren -- one finds oneself constantly alluding to it -- that the pressure is for us. It is also for mankind generally, of course, for it has the gospel in mind, the work of God.
{199}
It is in view of soil, that in which God can work more freely and resultfully than He has been working in modern times. He is going to get something out of it. The responsible man here is Hezekiah. It was now a question of those responsible amongst the people of God, those who understood the time; who knew what Israel ought to do. The king was deeply concerned, but he knew what to do -- and he sends to the prophet. We have been speaking today of the prophetic word. There are those who, like Hezekiah, are sincere in their responsibility and know where to turn. It is a most important thing to know where to turn in a crisis.
The prophetic word, I believe, is a prime thought at the moment. God is affording it and, as we had it today. He would have us to make way for it. The preparatory way for it is the way of surpassing excellence, that is, the way of love; not the way of complaint; not the way of depression, but the way of love. It includes the whole assembly in a given place; that is, all who are walking in the light of the assembly, and God would stress that -- *all*. "If therefore the *whole* assembly come together (@1 Corinthians 14:23)". God loves the thought of the assembly. He loves to see it functioning, and it functions in many ways, but in this particular way, the way of surpassing excellence which is preparatory to the incoming of the divine mind through the prophetic word. Why should we be without it, dear brethren? God said of old that He makes known His mind to the prophets. He will do nothing without bringing them into it. He said of Abraham, "Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do? (@Genesis 18:17)" He did not. Abraham was a prophet. Why should we be without the divine mind? We cannot get along without it. So those who were responsible, like Hezekiah, had recourse to the divine mind. They had recourse to the prophet. So did Josiah. He knew where to turn. It was a woman, a prophetess, but nevertheless one who conveyed the mind of God.
{200}
She dwelt in the "second quarter" of the city, but he had access to her, and he did not despise her dwelling. He sought her and he found her, and she conveyed the divine mind to him, and there was a great result in the increase in quality of the service of God. That is the point. You may be assured of it, that today the point is increase in the quality and extent of the service of God. It was so in Hezekiah's day and also in Josiah's day. Hezekiah is *adding* here. The result of all this pressure is a positive contribution to the hymns, to the means of divine praises. That is what you get in Hezekiah, so too in Josiah. This book does not give us all the facts of Hezekiah. What contributions there were when he opened the doors of the house of the Lord, and how he brought in Nathan and David, the great leaders in song, but it is all in connection with this, that the sincere man in responsibility knew where to turn. He turned to the prophet Isaiah.
I do not want to enlarge on the chapter, but the message of Isaiah was, "Ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof". This is agricultural work, skilled farming. That is the thought, that we come to this through pressure. It is a question of a remnant, but God is going to improve what there is of Himself. He appreciates what there is, but He would *improve* what there is, and He would improve it through prophetic means; but He would remind us of what the first year is in order to reach the third year, and the idea of a remnant taking root downwards and bearing fruit upwards. What grows of itself is not the result of skilled work, but still it is the work of God. The soil that is of God produces *something*. Spiritually, where would any of us be if it were not for that? Before the revival of the truth in these latter days there was but little skilled labour in the
{201}
scriptural sense, but nevertheless there was growth and many of us got blessing. There was that which grew of itself, without skilled cultivation. But God intends that there should be skilled cultivation of the land. Adam was to dress and keep the garden of Eden; but as you go afield in Christendom, there is no skilled cultivation, and yet it is in a sense the divine soil. There are saints there and we include them in our thoughts and prayers. The process leads to "the third year", when the saints, divinely instructed, are to sow and reap.
What is the idea of sowing? The idea is that there is a soil which will produce a harvest, and that soil implies that as the seed goes into it there is a root whence sap is drawn. So we sow and we reap; that is in truth what has come about through the sovereign mercy of our God in bringing about remnant conditions. They are features of the early part of the dispensation. We are told, for instance, to sow to the Spirit. That is one idea of sowing. There are many so-called denominations of men which do not do that. They may sow in a human way, and being more or less sincere, they get some fruit, but it is what grows of itself. There is no skilled agricultural work, whereas the thought of God is that there should be skilled and careful workmanship, that of those who know what they are doing. We sow and we reap. Sow to the Spirit, says the apostle Paul. Let us look into that word, as to whether we have been doing it. Many have been sowing to the flesh. I know well enough in myself how much of that there is. But what do we reap from that sowing? Corruption. In @Genesis 6 we read that corruption and violence filled the earth. Why? There was sowing to the flesh. But as we sow to the Spirit, we shall reap life everlasting. We reap it on such occasions amongst the brethren as the present one; the Holy Spirit Himself in us causes the water of life in us to spring up into
{202}
everlasting life. That is the idea, that we sow in the third year. People that are instructed in the light of God, in the teaching of the truth, understand how to sow in order to reap, to sow *for a desired crop. "* ... the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof". It is an intelligent process for: "... the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward". God is looking for that. It is fruit borne upward, not affected by thorns or weeds, not affected by the want of skill in attending to it. The fruit grows upward. That is what marks the remnant.
I now come to Nebuchadnezzar, the head of the Gentile monarchies, the "head of gold". God made him so. God has set out His mind as to these four monarchies, having made in them provision for the public government of the world until Christ sets up His kingdom. They are in this sense part of His service and He gives a remarkable lead in Nebuchadnezzar. He would make him a representative of Himself, not only in rule, but in spirit, for indeed he became a preacher, but it was through *discipline*. If there are any here under specific discipline, the book of Daniel, in Nebuchadnezzar, furnishes instruction as to this matter of roots, that, in spite of the discipline, being a subject of the work of God by His Spirit, the real root is in you. Those of us who know you may say. The root of God is there. You have been inflated, given way to pride and ambition, to lust it may be, and the discipline surely came. The truth as to his discipline came directly to Nebuchadnezzar, first in his dream, then by Daniel in interpretation, and then by a voice from heaven, so that the discipline is put into execution -- the tree is cut down, but the stump is left. It does not *fall* down. We read of trees falling down and they are found there, but a tree *cut* down is a different matter, because the sap is in the tree. It is not dead. Job says, "there is
{203}
hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that It will sprout again ... through the scent of water it will bud",(@Job 14:7,9). When it falls there is a suggestion of its being dead, ... Jude speaks of certain being "... twice dead, plucked up by the roots (@Jude 12)". Apostasy is setting in now; that is what is happening.
In the case before us the root is in the ground, whence the sap is drawn, where the life-spring is. Discipline proceeds, but the stump of the roots of this tree is to be held in the earth by a band of iron and brass. You may say. That brother ought to be back in fellowship. Ought he? If the band of iron and brass is there surely according to God, then the suggestion is that there is no growth in a true sense while discipline is being exercised. I refer to formal discipline as seen here. The object of discipline is the destruction of the flesh; that is, it is a negative thought, but a necessary negative thought in order that there should be a positive; that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. In the meantime there is the band of iron and brass. The discipline is not lifted. The Lord said, "Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven (@Matthew 18:18)". It is a question now of showing unmistakably that the flesh is dealt with definitely. We are bound by the hands of the brethren, but also released by the hands of the brethren, for the Lord further says, "whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven", @Matthew 18:18. We know that the Corinthians failed in this, but they were amenable to the apostle's injunction that they should confirm their love to the offender; that implies that the bands are removed.
We read in Daniel how Nebuchadnezzar came to this. It is a most instructive chapter in that way. We see how he came to it and how manifestly he judged himself, but there was a definite period of seven times to pass over him. God fixed the period, and that period
{204}
had to run its course. He was to eat grass like an ox, a beast's heart was given to him. In the tender grass he was wet with the dew of heaven. Think of *such* discipline! Nebuchadnezzar was just in the circumstances of a beast. It was all discipline. The facts were to wear down the flesh, to destroy it. He had to experience them for seven years -- spiritually a *complete* period; and then God released him. The period appointed by God synchronised exactly with the result of the discipline of the man, so that he now praises the God of heaven. He says, "Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of the heavens, all whose works are truth, and his paths judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase (@Daniel 4:37)". He preaches the gospel, too, we may say, as the early verses of the chapter show.
Finally there are these roots which belong to us in the Colossian state. Some of you may be asking in your minds. What does he mean by that? The truth is that local assemblies have states generally differing from each other. It is remarkable that what characterises a town or city affects the brethren. The Lord says to the apostle Paul, "I have much people in this city (@Acts 18:10)". Corinth was in His mind and all the influences of Corinth over the Christian were, no doubt, in His mind, too. Local companies are affected by the characteristics of the city in which they are, and that affection causes a state which has to be corrected. In fact, it has to be understood what the influence is, so that we may provide against it; set our faces against it, so as to overcome it. What marked Colosse was that it had got on well. The apostle Paul had not been there. It was not a Pauline assembly for some reason, although it was in the province of Asia. They had not seen his face in the flesh, but they had gone on in the truth and he could say that he rejoiced as in spirit present with them. "For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit,
{205}
joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ (@Colossians 2:5)". All that was pleasing to the apostle, but then there was the need of being rooted in love and built up in Christ. The wording is somewhat different from that in Ephesians, but this is in keeping with the state of the Colossians, for they were in danger of philosophy (that is, human learning) and vain deceit. These two things go together. Where there is the love of human learning or wisdom (which the word philosophy signifies) there is vanity and deceitfulness.
In truth learning enables us to deceive. Refined people are often extremely deceptive. They seek to convey the best kind of feelings outwardly, while in truth they are not there at all. They can put on skilfully a veneer that conceals the real state below. So philosophy and vain deceit go together. Learning too helps people to sin. Thus some become skilful in it. The world is marked by this at the present time. There is careful education as to how to be lawless, how to gratify the lawless desires of the flesh in the most skilful way to get the greatest results. Hence the Colossians needed this word from the apostle: "... Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving". The point is *"in him"*, that is, *in Christ*, takes us out of the realm of the world altogether. As in Christ, you do not need philosophy. To say nothing of the evil of it, you do not need it. What the apostle means is the realm to which you have been brought as in Christ -- rooted in Him, built up in Him. Your soul is maintained in the sense of your status in Christ You are built up in that relation. You are not allowing spiritual instruction to add to you as a man in this world. Many add them together -- the spiritual intelligence with the status in this world, the money, the human education a man may have -- all to make a certain show. That is very objectionable to God,
{206}
also damaging to the testimony. What saves us from it is, "... Rooted and built up *in him*  ..." That is, it is *exclusive;* "in him" excludes all that is unsuited to Him, that is unnecessary in Him. In Him we have everything that is necessary, so that we deliberately refuse philosophy and vain deceit. Thus the further necessity of being "... stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving". The status, dear brethren, "in Christ" is exclusive, in which you need nothing of this world. Anything of Egypt is a reproach there. Hence the instruction in @Joshua 5 as to circumcision: through it the reproach of Egypt was rolled away. The full bearing of that type is set out in our chapter: "in whom also ye have been circumcised ... in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ,(@Colossians 2:11)". Christ has judicially terminated the flesh in its totality in His vicarious sufferings, and now it is under reproach, it is abominated in the realm of Christ. Thus we are to be "Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving". This is a passage that is most essential to us in view of all that we have had before us as to the kind of pressure we are enduring, so that we may be outside the world and the mind of man, the world of learning and philosophy and vain deceit. We are outside of it all as "in Christ" and then established there and built up there. "Assured in the faith, even as ye have been taught".
{207}
THE SUPREMACY OF CHRIST
@2 Samuel 19:9 - 30; @John 21:18 - 22
I wish to speak about the *supremacy of Christ*. It applies to each believer; to each assembly; to the whole assembly; and to the whole earth, and to the whole universe. The supremacy of Christ relates to all. It is an appointment by God, but what is in mind now is that each of us may make it his appointment, his resolve, that Christ is to be supreme in his soul, in his house, in his business, and in the assembly in which he has part. God has made Him both Lord and Christ, we are told, and being by the right hand of God exalted. He has sent down the Spirit, as Peter says, "he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear". (@Acts 2:33). The coming of the Spirit, among other things, was to establish and maintain the supremacy of Christ in believers, and in the assembly.
The history of the public body, preceding the revival of the last days, tells of revolt and displacement of Christ, and since that time the Holy Spirit has been operating to bring out the establishment in some, at least in a remnant, of what God had ordained. The overcomer in Thyatira is regarded by the Lord as one who is able to rule, implying that the assembly in Thyatira had disregarded the authority of Christ, and the overcomer there would have part in the rule in which Christ is to serve universally presently. It was in a remnant day: "to you I say, the rest who are in Thyatira", (@Revelation 2:24). In other words, what may be called a reconstruction in the history of the assembly began, and is typified in the chapter from which I read in the second book of Samuel. The Reformation made a way for it, but did not really establish it, for it did not overthrow man's rule in the professing body.
{208}
Much work was done which led up to the reconstruction period, but there was little or no construction according to God in the Reformation. The work scarcely went beyond what we may call individual, that is justification by faith. That is not properly an assembly truth. In later years, I may say centuries later, the reconstruction work began, and it began with the recognition of Christ in heaven. As Pentecost began, so did this work begin, only in a smaller way: it was a "day of small things";(@Zechariah 4:10) but nevertheless the divine way was resumed. That is what I have in mind to dwell upon, that we may see the manner of reconstruction.
Israel was scattered according to the verses read: "all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the land of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom. And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?" @2 Samuel 19:9,10. The real facts of the case are laid out. The speaker or speakers were undoubtedly moved by the Spirit of God to call attention to the real state of the matter, the state of the people. For it is as sure as anything, if one is leading astray, as in the case of Absalom, the fault is not only in Absalom, it also exists in the people. Some amongst them have come to see this. They have come to judge the state of the people. There was strife among them. You will observe that it is throughout all the tribes of Israel: "all the people ... throughout all the tribes of Israel". A most lamentable state of things, felt by someone, and that someone is able to convey the facts of the case; a most important matter in crises. Then the speaker, or speakers, say, "why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?" That is the real issue, and that is the issue through all these verses and throughout all the verses in John's gospel. It is the
{209}
issue universally, too, today in Christendom, and will be the issue in Jewry by and by, after the assembly is taken away by the Lord, in His love for her. The Jews will come into evidence, and the issue will again be the supremacy of Christ. God will work, or nothing could be done. However much activity there is, dear brethren, unless God is in the work, there is nothing really accomplished. What is accomplished must be accomplished by God. He uses instruments, but He does the work, and that is so here.
They plainly say, "Absalom ... is dead". He is no longer the issue. So that the eye is directed away from him. All Israel, we may say, followed him at one time. He was a man of great natural attractiveness. He made it a point to be attractive. Men who draw disciples after them make a point of being attractive, and so it was with Absalom. He is not a type of the antichrist, but of antichristian influences at the present time. Now he is dead. Thank God many antichrists are dead. The antichrist is not manifest yet; he is not publicly known now; the time has yet to come for this, as the apostle Paul says, "that he might be revealed in his time", (@2 Thessalonians 2:6); there is that which hinders him now. He will come quickly when his time arrives, when God withdraws the hindering element. "Absalom ... is dead". Thank God for all Absaloms that are dead and not living. They are to be feared if they are living. Men who take on the character of antichrist, whether politically or religiously, for we have to take both into account -- we thank God when they are dead. The antichrist himself will never die as ordinary men die, he will be cast alive into the lake of fire. That is God's judgment of him. Before there is a shot fired in the great battle according to @Revelation 19, the beast and the false prophet are taken alive and cast into the lake of fire. Such is God's way of pouring contempt on human strength or human combinations of strength.
{210}
David himself follows up this word, saying, "Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house?" The issue is that Christ should be supreme. His authority has been interfered with. David's authority had been interfered with. He had been caused to flee his capital and his house, and now the voice of the people is heard, "Now therefore, why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?" There had been much speaking previously, doubtless; much strife as to the battle that had just been fought. Naturally, we are always ready to talk about such things, but not a voice raised to bring the king back. That was the real issue; and so the king takes a hand in it himself. At the opportune moment in all crises and issues, the Lord comes in and takes a hand Himself in the matter. He has done it, as I said, in the great revival one hundred or more years ago. It was a constructive revival. God has always been constructive. It is easy to pull down, but not so easy to build up. Thus the Lord comes in constructively, in due course, in all these issues. Here David sends a message by two trustworthy men, Zadok and Abiathar the priests, saying, "Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying. Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house?"
"Why are ye the last?" How many there are in Christendom today who are not doing this, even now! Thank God for any who are doing it. He knows those that are His. Many are not moving at all to bring Him back to His house. If I am to bring Him back to His house I must begin to open *my heart* to Him, because the saints are His house; and not simply open my heart, but begin to look into myself, and see whether things are right in my heart, and if not, see that they are set right. For in truth that is the idea, the Lord is deprived, by many of His own, of what belongs to Him. Hence David further says, "Art thou not my bone and my flesh", verse 13. "Why are ye the last to bring the king back?" To whom is this spoken? As applied
{211}
today, it is the word of Christ to every Christian in this room, to every Christian in Newcastle, to every Christian in the world. That is the message by two trustworthy men; two priests who so far had served well. David is a type of Christ appealing to His people -- "Why are ye the last?" Why should you be allowing personal considerations, why should you be apathetic to the rights of Christ in your own heart; allowing wretched things, it may be, to shut Him out? He is knocking at your door. If He comes in. He comes in for an assured end; as He said to Joshua earlier, "No; for as captain of the army of Jehovah am I now come (@Joshua 5:14)". That is. He came at the right time, and coming in at the right time. He will make an end of the matter. He is stronger than any of us. If we keep on shutting Him out, something of a serious nature will happen to us. That is a warning. He has rights, and means to enforce them. Are we stronger than He? Not only do governmental things happen now, but actually punitive things happen also. The apostle Paul does not hesitate to say, "If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed", (@Galatians 1:9); not when the Lord comes, as in @1 Corinthians 16:22, but *now*. A most solemn thing. The Lord would assert His rights, and not only His rights, but His power to enforce them.
In Zadok and Abiathar there was a dual testimony, and it was effective. The Lord raises up two instead of one -- one may do, but two is *adequate* testimony -- and here is an effective appeal. The word is "my bone and my flesh". "Why are ye the last?" You Christians! You know you once confessed Him; maybe you were once in fellowship. Why not now? Many testimonies have been rendered to you. Two trusted men here, Zadok and Abiathar the priests, were used by David to bow the hearts of the men of Israel. That is what God is looking for, someone to relinquish his
{212}
own assumed rights or grievances, it may be. Instead of standing by unmoved, bow your heart to the message of Christ. It says, "ye are my brethren, ye are my bone and my flesh", verse 12. He is speaking to known persons. The Lord is here suggesting in type the very greatest thoughts to us, so as to move us to give up our selfish thoughts, and to give Him His rights in our souls. We are told, "he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah as of one man; and they sent to the king, Return thou and all thy servants".
You may say. Never mind the servants, I have grievances against them. Many in Israel might have had grievances against many in Judah or *vice versa*. Some of David's servants might not have been acceptable, but they were now. How often some claim to admit Christ and say much about Him, but nothing about His servants, or it may be slander them. The test now is whether you will admit His servants. We read of the Lord being invited to a marriage, and also His disciples, @John 2:2, which shows that the Lord was truly considered -- His disciples were also invited. Simon the Pharisee did not invite His disciples, and so it is, if we are really bowed by the message of Jesus to our hearts, we shall admit all His servants, for His servants enhance Him. Think of Christ and His apostles. Who would leave *them* out? The Lord looks for you to value them. They represent Him. All His servants do; here *all* David's servants were invited to return. In this respect we are not to discriminate. The Lord is a better judge of men than we are, and if He has chosen servants let us accept them. He says, "He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me", (@John 13:20). Let us never assume to know better than the Lord. Many do, to their grief and to the grief of their brethren, too. The Lord has selected men as His servants, and wisdom in us will accept them. We need them. How great the need is for true servants!
{213}
Well, this is the result of a message typically from Christ to those who really belong to Him; those of whom He can say, "my bone and my flesh". There is a distinguished one here, Amasa, who was personally near to him, and David says to him, "Art thou not my bone and my flesh?" What an appeal! This is one of the greatest thoughts. Not simply bought, or redeemed by Him, but of His bone and His flesh. That is the position in the reconstruction period. Everything must begin with Christ and His supremacy or nothing will be right. While that is lacking; and it includes His servants, for in truth the Lord is never (I am not speaking in any way than to glorify Christ) more attractive than in the midst of His house and His servants. Why should I rob myself, and rob Him of His pleasure and His glory? Why talk so much of the Lord personally yet disregard His servants and His people?
Well, in this period where reconstruction is proceeding, all kinds of people will be moved, so, as you will observe, we read here that "Judah came to Gilgal". I should say something about that before I go on to Shimei. Scripture says, "the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan", verse 15. The king, we are told, returned and came to the Jordan. That is the way he comes. The meeting is to be there. Jordan I need not enlarge on; it is a type of death, but it is finality. In Jordan things are dealt with in a final way, but the accompaniment of Jordan on the Jerusalem side is Gilgal, and Judah went to Gilgal. Dear brethren, if reconstruction is to include us all, this the way. Go to Gilgal, The king has come to Jordan. He is coming that way. There is a ferry there. We do not know who supplied that ferry or who worked it. I suppose it refers to the underlying, unpretentious love ready to serve the Lord as need arises -- here is an important way. Judah
{214}
was at Gilgal. David was at the Jordan. Why not let us take that way? It is the true way, the spiritual way. If Christ is to be in His house truly, I have to go that way. I have been speaking of getting things right in my own soul, and Gilgal is the place for adjustment. It is through sharp knives, no compromise or reserves. It is a place of sharp knives. That is to say, things are dealt with at their roots at Gilgal, and hence I am suitable to come to Gilgal and conduct the king over the Jordan. What a fine combination of spiritual things you get here! It is the way of reconstruction, so that each of us should have his place in the structure. Christ is supreme in the assembly, "Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone(@Ephesians 2:20)". It is a question of His supremacy, and thus of ornamentation by Him. We must have Christ first. He must have His place if there is to be a final state of things, and one that God can approve.
Well, Shimei comes, and so does Ziba. They want to make their peace with the king. Why did they not do it before? One of them, a blasphemous sort of man, cursed the king. He has now the heart to come, and he comes; and the sequel shows he is not to be turned aside; and so does Ziba come. They both come with display; the former with a thousand men of Benjamin. That is no way to come to make a confession. I am not saying that Shimei was not pardoned. In result it is only a provisional pardon that he gets, whereas what is needed is a plenary one, such as will carry the penitent through. The sequel proved he did not judge himself. Solomon tested him, and the test brought out that he was not subject, and he lost his life.
Then we have Ziba with his fifteen sons and twenty servants, but that is not the way to come to confess, to put things right. He was a slanderer. In all difficulties amongst us you maybe sure there are men like Ziba and Shimei, and when the king is coming back they want to get right, to be reinstated. These two men are
{215}
to be taken notice of -- I touch again on Shimei because his case brings out another type, namely, one of the sons of Zeruiah, Abishai, a man that was on David's side always, but a very hard kind of man. All these things come out in this crisis, as Simeon says to Joseph and Mary: "that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed (@Luke 2:35)". That is the king, and so, here is a man that is always on the side of David, a hard man, as I said, and he would dissipate grace. He would ignore the dispensation as illustrated in what was said in the assembly in Jerusalem: "The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon", (@Luke 24:34). A man like Abishai would make little of that. He would say, if he were there. Why Simon, why appear to Simon, who denied the Lord? Why has the Lord appeared to him first? Abishai says to David, "Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the Lord's anointed?" verse 21. You say. It is obvious, but is it obvious? Is a man like this son of Zeruiah, Abishai, to be the judge? What is *his* history? That of a hard man, as I said. David says I am not going to submit to that judgment. Whatever reputation a man has of being loyal to the truth, reading all the ministry, and able to give a good lead in the readings, if he is a hard spirited man*he is not to be trusted for judgment;* maybe for doctrine, but not for judgment.
What one needs for judgment is spirituality: "ye that are spiritual". David says, "What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me?" verse 22. Think of a man who has a reputation of being one of David's men; yet David says "ye ... be adversaries unto me". Such a man who has a good reputation as being out and out for David is an adversary to David through the hardness of his heart. He does not know grace, and so David further says, "shall there any man be put to death this day, in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day
{216}
king over Israel?" verse 22. That is the point. Typically it is the Lord asserting His authority. It is "this day" we are dealing with. It is a question of principles now, not persons, and David is king, and his judgment stands, not Abishai's. We want to get the Lord's mind. If any man speak, let it be as oracles of God, @1 Peter 4:11. I may have a certain judgment, but coming into the assembly, my judgment may become changed, God being there, and I ought to be ready for that. The spirit of a hard man is utterly incompatible with the assembly of God. In this respect the truth marking the assembly is, "The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon" (@Luke 24:34) -- the one who offended most seriously. It is a question of grace, and David is stressing this point. He says, "I am this day king". It is not what anyone else says. In the antitype it is a question of the Lord, what *His* mind is. We want to be in line with that and able to convey it as needed. If we are to have reconstruction we must have grace, and what goes with that is the breaking of bread. That is what marked the assembly in Jerusalem according to @Luke 24. David says, "do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?" It was a triumph. Thus Shimei's matter is settled. David is establishing principles. Shimei had come down with a thousand Benjaminites. One can see that he had not fully judged himself, but it is a question of Christ and the principles governing that particular time. He is establishing principles; to set up again the dispensation, as it were. The king said to Shimei, "Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him". That is a landmark as to principles. So under all circumstances we must have the character of the dispensation maintained.
Then we have Mephibosheth; another man appears. He does not go to Jordan. He meets David "as Jerusalem came to meet the king", verse 25. He is a Jerusalem man. He is a man that belongs to the place. "He had
{217}
neither washed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace". That is to say he indicates he is not making any show at all. His external appearance indicated his internal love for David. In that sense he was perfectly dressed. In Mephibosheth there was unswerving affection for the king, and desire that he should be in his own place, that is, in his house. David had his own place *in Mephibosheth*. That is the next point, so that Mephibosheth says to the king in verse 30, "Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house". Not simply into Jerusalem, but into his*own house*. Nothing will be right until he is in his own house, on the throne, too. In the antitype it is that Christ should have His full place in the assembly -- in the hearts of His own.
If a local company is to be right, the supremacy of Christ must take effect in every heart in it. He is thus in His own house. He has come back to it. He has been in it, but ousted from it. Now He has come back to it. Is not the Lord speaking to us in this so that we may renounce our self assertions, our self vindications, and let the Lord have His place, and all will be right? So Mephibosheth crowns the reconstruction here when he says. Let Ziba have all. I am not concerned about the land, I am concerned about the king, in his house, for as far as I am concerned he has always been in it, that is, in my heart. He wants the king in every heart in Jerusalem. He is a Jerusalem man, and a Jerusalem man wants all the saints in Jerusalem, that the king may have his full place in his house. It is a question of the assembly, and each being in it, and allowing the Lord His place in his heart, so that He may have it in a collective way.
Now to finish, just a word in regard to @John 21, to show how Peter was brought to this. I need not go
{218}
over the chapter, but it is a reconstruction chapter. Seven of the disciples had gone *off* fishing, after the Lord had manifested Himself to them, setting them up in the assembly. Peter's own name means "stone". The Lord had been striving to set these men in the building, now they have gone off fishing. So that there has to be recovery, and it is seen in this chapter. I do not go into the details of the Lord's searching of Simon's heart, but it is really a heart matter, as indeed in @2 Samuel 19. Seven of them went off fishing and they caught nothing. The Lord was on the shore with a dinner ready for them -- a regular meal, not simply something to eat; for such is Christ. He would take His place again in their hearts in His own dignity, through the way He provides for them. "Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine", (@John 21:12), for that is the word; it is used for the chief meal of the day; and as they dine, the Lord speaks to Peter. In the end of verse 17 He came to final probing of Peter's heart. It was a heart question. I suppose Peter was never more tested in his heart than at this time. It was in the presence of the Lord. The Lord was here carrying on a transaction to secure Peter's heart, so that He could confide in him, not doctrine here, but *persons*. Think of the value of the saints to Christ! "My lambs", He says, "my sheep". In effect He says to Peter, I am going to trust you with them, but you must let Me into your heart, you must let Me settle all these things in your heart that you have been going on with: all your self-confidence and pride. It is a heart matter, and so finally the third time -- more than twice -- the Lord says to him, verse 17, "Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him. Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him. Feed my sheep (@John 21:17)". One has often called attention to this verse. There are two words in the
{219}
original for *know*. Here the first is what is called conscious knowledge. Peter says to the Lord, "Thou knowest all things". He recognises His deity, which is all-important, and especially at the present time. One who knows everything is God, for only God knows everything, and Peter acknowledges this. He knows it consciously, not only by observation; he is aware of it in every respect. But then Peter adds another word for *know*, and he says, in effect. Is there not something about me to show You that I love You? That would be objective knowledge. Peter is calling attention to himself as before the Lord, saying: Lord, is there not something in me to show You that I really do love You? That is the point, and it finishes the matter. The Lord did not deny what Peter implied. There was something in Peter's manner that indicated his love for Christ. The Lord knew the love was there, but it had been hidden, beclouded by his conduct. All the clouds are now gone and the Lord intimates that the matter is settled, and hence Peter can be entrusted with the sheep and the lambs. The Lord will not trust us until we are thoroughly transparent and it can be seen that we love Him.
Now I refer for a moment to the verses I read, "Jesus says to him ... When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest; but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not. This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him. Follow me. Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said. Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee? Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? Jesus saith unto him. If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou
{220}
me", verses 18 - 22. This is a question of the Lord's *will* -"if I will". It is again the supremacy of Christ; Peter must recognise it in regard to the Lord's servants. "If I will". The matter is settled that the service of the loved one (that is, John) is left open; as if the Lord were to say. Peter, you cannot manage everything. It is a question of My will, as to what this or that one must do. Peter was wanting to be in the know of things about everybody, but the Lord reserves His own rights as to whom He will use. Can I tell whom the Lord will be using twenty years from now? He has His servants, and foresees every emergency. My business is to follow Him and recognise that the Lord has His rights, and not seek to know or control everything. Leave the matter open. Let the Lord dispose of His servants as He will, and it will always be to the best advantage for the testimony. So, I would emphasise that in all these scriptures it is a question of the supremacy of Christ amongst His people, and nothing will be right until everyone of us accords Him that place in our hearts, and then collectively as in the assembly.
{221}
HOW PROPHETIC MINISTRY AFFECTS THE SERVICE OF GOD
@1 Corinthians 14:22 - 25; @2 Samuel 12:25;@2 Chronicles 29:25; @1 Chronicles 25:1
My discourse at this time will have the service of God in mind, to show particularly how prophecy affects it. There can be no doubt that the current sorrowful international conditions are intended by God to bring His people into the reality of the light vouchsafed to them. One man, David, who had a great place in the service of God, as I hope to show, both as inaugurator and as actively engaged in the service, said, "in pressure, thou hast enlarged me", (@Psalm 4:1), so that we are not to evade any pressure divinely brought about. We may occasion pressure upon ourselves, and have to reap of our own sowing, but if God bring on the pressure, either directly or indirectly, it is not to be evaded, it is to be accepted, and in the acceptance of it we shall profit by it, so that our part in the service of God shall be more effective. God will obtain more from us.
One of the last things said by God in the Old Testament, according to the arrangement of the books is, "Will a man rob God?" (@Malachi 3:8). God shows in that book that His people were indeed robbing Him in tithes and offerings, and He directs them to bring the tithes into the storehouse, and they would see what He would do. He would open the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing which they would not be able to contain. Such is the attitude of God in a day of small things. And in that same book, that is, Malachi, Jehovah shows how He values those who *fear* Him. They that feared the Lord spake often one to another and He hearkened. We are not told *what* they were saying, but they feared Him. We may be sure they were not always
{222}
talking about the weather, the markets, or the like -- although they may have had to touch those things. They were speaking in a holy way, as in our own day, those who fear the Lord, calling upon Him out of a pure heart, would speak of "things above". They set their minds on things above, and speak of those things, for in truth a wonderful range of things opens up to us, as by the Spirit *we set our minds on them* . The word *above* is relative; it implies moral elevation, and thus the constitution of the saints becomes enhanced. They are not absorbed in the ordinary common talk of men and women, what is often small and even corrupt. God would remind us of our dignity and our capabilities, and the Spirit, we are told, searcheth all things, even the depths of God. He searches them as in us, and in relation to us, not on His own account, for as God He knows all; and believers as having Him know all things, @1 John 2:20. He searches the things of God as in us so as to bring out the reserves, the wonderful things of God, things that were before this world: "Things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that love him". (@1 Corinthians 2:9). He has great regard for those that love Him -- of course, those whom He loves, too.
So with all this in view I read in 1 Corinthians; not because it is a specially heavenly epistle; it is a wilderness epistle, intended to regulate us as in the wilderness. It gives us the position of the assembly in the wilderness, and the behaviour proper to it, and how God is to be served in it. We have commandments; indeed, it would seem as if the whole first epistle is one commandment; headed up under the words "commandment of the Lord". "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise ... that it is the Lord's commandment", (@1 Corinthians 14:37). The verses I have read are, therefore, included in the
{223}
commandment, that is, that there *should* be meetings for prophetic ministry. What is said in those verses leads to greater things; indeed, the whole chapter refers to greater things. "I will sing", for instance, "with the spirit, but I will sing also with the understanding", (@1 Corinthians 14:15).
One would love to have heard the apostle sing. There is not a verse of a hymn sung by the apostles now extant, as far as is known, but heaven used to hear them -- beautiful tones, we may be sure, and beautiful words, too! So that Paul said, "I will sing with the Spirit, but I will sing also with the understanding (@1 Corinthians 14:15)". You may be sure he could sing, as well as David and Moses. The Spirit of adoption in us, the Holy Spirit viewed in that way, indites the true songs; songs of Zion; songs of the assembly. We read of a song in heaven; it is said to be a "new" one, in wonderful tones, "as a voice of many waters, and as a voice of great thunder", (@Revelation 14:12); and yet it was the voice of harpers harping with their harps. Those who formed the assembly are being trained now to have part in that wonderful service above in immense volume, and yet in distinct symphony, and with the highest kind of musical instruments, namely, harps; symbolically, the most refined notes issue from them. Prophetic ministry bears on all this, as our chapter shows.
So these verses deal with prophecy. They enjoin meetings for prophecy, not in an arbitrary way, but the epistle shows how important they are, and how superior to other meetings. They are superior, at least in this sense that they bring about education in a person who is ignorant, or an unbeliever, even, and that education leads to self-judgment, and it involves that all present judge. We are not to be afraid of the saints¬ judgment. We cannot trust our own. Not that one may not judge oneself thoroughly, but we have to be on the watch, for our hearts are so deceptive. It is wholesome,
{224}
at times, to hear of the judgment of others as to us, and not to underestimate it. Not that such judgment may not sometimes be unfair, but at the same time, it is safe to listen to what others say about us.
The word *judgment* is a key-word of this epistle, both as to ourselves and as to others, *for we are not only to prepare for the singing in heaven* , but also be in the light of the judgment-seat of Christ. How great are our prospects! "Do ye not know that we shall judge angels?" (@1 Corinthians 6:3), and the world, too; but how shall we ever attain to that, *save as we learn to judge ourselves in the very roots of our being* , and to ask others, too, as to what they think? For normally our brethren are in accord with what scripture teaches and are worthy of our confidence. So we are to confess our faults one to another and pray for one another, and, of course, to confess our faults to God. It is a great advantage to confess our faults to the Lord's people. And, of course -- according to their character, as scripture indicates -- *certain sins should be confessed to the assembly, its judgment of them being necessary* .
So these verses contemplate prophetic ministry, such as brings about self-judgment in a person, even if it be an unbeliever; and I may say that the Christian assemblies are in this public sense open to all. God is there, and even an unbeliever may be reached by the word. Let no one say he cannot go in. The door is there and so, according to the passage, an unlearned man, or an unbeliever, might go in, and the prophesying is going on, and he comes under the power of it, and is convicted in his own soul and is convicted of all present. For such is the wonderful organism of the assembly. The whole assembly is affected by what happens. There is no part dark. If people do not understand me, why is it? If I am convicted they should know, but if they do not know, then I should let them know; there is something I have to confess to them. So that he is
{225}
convicted of all and judged of all, and he falls down, we are told, and he *worships God* . That is the point I have in mind in the verse. *It alludes to the worship of God* . The immediate result of this man's conviction is that he worships God, and not only so, but he goes out to his house and his friends and his acquaintances, and tells them God is in that assembly. He will report, says the apostle, "that God is in you of a truth".
Now having said all that, I want to go to the Old Testament to show how this matter of prophecy is integrally linked up with the service of God. You will observe that the great leaders of song in @1 Chronicles 25 are said to be prophesying as well as singing, prophesying on harps Three of them, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, were really prophets. Two of them are called the king's seers, and that leads me to speak about Nathan and Gad. These two prophets are presented in scripture as serving David, and Solomon his son. Not that one would undertake to say that they did not serve others, but why is it that David should have two prophets? In fact, as far as I can see, there are four prophets of his, Nathan and Gad, Jeduthun and Heman. The last two are called his seers. Nathan is called a prophet. Heman and Jeduthun are called the king's seers, and the facts as to Nathan show that he served David exclusively; the Spirit of God is stressing the importance of prophecy in relation to the service of God, and David represents this *par excellence*, in the Old Testament. Indeed he is, we may say, the inaugurator of it "the sweet psalmist of Israel (@2 Samuel 23:1)". He inaugurates the service and maintains it. How valuable then is the service of these prophets! What would have happened to David without them? Nathan's service is especially to be noted; and as David needed such ministry, so do we all. The most spiritual of us is capable of sin. David, one of the most exalted men indeed, one of the most spiritual men in the Old
{226}
Testament, fell under the power of Satan in the most grievous way, and on more than one occasion; and Nathan and Gad were used of God for his deliverance. But I am speaking now of aid in the service of God. These prophets had their part in the service of song; they augmented the service of song as David's prophets, or seers.
Well, what I have said indicates the need of prophetic ministry in the service of song, and the question should arise with each of us as to whether he is contributing anything among the saints in this sense. I believe that enters into the verses I read. David had seers, and hence the question rightly arises as to any gathering. Are there any seers there? Have the saints any seers, those who prophesy on harps, prophesy, as it were, as they sing?
That is in a general way what is in mind, and I now wish to speak a little more about Nathan. He is the one specially in view -- a remarkable man. He represents all the prophets in a sense, for his name signifies *gift* , a suitable name for such a man. His first appearance is in @2 Samuel 7, and the result there is to bring to light the sonship of Christ typically. One of the greatest results in ministry is to make clear the sonship of Christ. God has greatly helped the brethren on that point, and Satan has sought to rob us and is still seeking to rob us of the gain of the inquiry and the exercises; but it belongs to Nathan in the historical books to bring this truth into evidence. That is why I read in @2 Samuel 12, because he is employed there to name Solomon. Solomon has two names there, but one of them is given by Nathan; not of himself; he is sent to give this name to Solomon -- Jedidiah -- it is an addition to the name David. David is the *beloved* , Jedidiah is the *beloved of Jehovah*, and Nathan is used of God to give that name to Solomon -- to him who typifies Christ as Son. Let us allow the name to come into our souls --
{227}
the beloved of Jehovah. It is not used again. This may be suggestive of the want of spirituality. In the New Testament we have more than its equivalent applied to Jesus in the voice from heaven: "Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight (@Mark 1:11)". Nathan is used to designate Solomon here as an object to divine love, bringing in the suggestion of sonship in regard to the service of God.
As regards Nathan's service to David, recorded in @2 Samuel 7, we can hardly say it was perfect. David said, "I dwell in the house of cedars, and the ark of God dwells under curtains @2 Samuel 7:2". Nathan immediately says, "Go, do all that is in thy heart; for Jehovah is with thee", @2 Samuel 7:3. How often we, in our little bit of ministry, speak to please someone present! That is a great danger, if some particular person or persons are present you would like something to please them. No prophet will do it, if he is in the spirit of prophecy. He would rather speak to their consciences than to their natural feelings. Nathan said to David, "do all that is in thy heart, for Jehovah is with thee (@2 Samuel 7:3)". That was saying a good deal, committing Jehovah to all that was in David's heart. God took Nathan in hand that night. David was *not* to build a house for Jehovah. He had it in his heart to build it, and we learn later that it was good that he had it in his heart, but it was not God's mind that he should build it, and David had to accept that. We do well in our ministry not to flatter anyone. Elihu says, "For I know not how to flatter; my Maker would soon take me away", (@Job 32:22). Nathan effectively delivers his message to David after God spoke to him and he tells him he is not to build the house. Let David's feelings be what they may, the word from Jehovah is that he is not to build His house. To be limited in that way causes humiliation. It ought to: I have gone beyond the mind of God, in what is in my heart. Well, if I have gone beyond the mind of God in
{228}
my heart, I had better be curtailed a bit and learn to retrace my steps, and learn there is some good reason for the message. David bows, thank God! He went into the house of the Lord and said the most wonderful things. I do not know of things fully equal to them earlier, but the burden of the message was that Solomon should build the house. His name was not mentioned, but Jehovah says, "It is he who shall build a house for my name ... I will be his father, and he shall be my son", (@2 Samuel 7:13,14).
That was the first message, the first bit of ministry of Nathan, according to the record in that chapter. He committed himself too freely at the beginning, but he did not miss Jehovah's mind, as Jehovah conveyed it to him; he faithfully delivered his message. One of the most important things in ministry is to be sure you have the message and then to deliver it without fear, without flattering anybody. That is what Nathan did, and so he is appointed to name this son. David named him Solomon, *peaceful* . You can understand how that, at that time, the great warrior David, who had had so many wars, would value peace. All true believers do, rightly. Through the reception of the gospel we have peace with God, and the mind of the Spirit in us is life and peace, and the abiding peace on earth is coming. It is peace in *heaven* now, @Luke 19:38, not on earth yet. Hence the idea of entering into God's rest: "we enter into the rest who have believed", (@Hebrews 4:3). It belongs to us. We can understand how David fostered the thought of peace when he called the second child born of Bath-sheba by the name of Solomon. But, as I said, Nathan was used to call him Jedidiah, namely, the *beloved of Jehovah* . How the heart rests with satisfaction in the appearance of Christ in type in that remarkable way! You can hardly get another example like it, a *child* to be designated *beloved of Jehovah* . How much is to be expected from him! But we transfer our thoughts
{229}
to the greater than Solomon, namely, the Son of God, that glorious One whom we are called upon to believe. As the Lord Himself said to the blind man whose eyes had been opened, "dost thou believe on the Son of God?" (@John 9:35). He said, "who is he. Lord, that I may believe on him?(@John 9:36)" May God help us to believe in Him, not because the Scriptures say that He is the Son of God, but to grasp the idea!
Nathan does not appear at all in the reconstruction period of which we spoke last night, but he does appear when there is a danger to Solomon. I wish you to notice particularly how he comes to the rescue, and stimulates the weakened monarch, David, so that he might not allow Adonijah to be king instead of Solomon. Solomon must be king, or there will be disaster. It is now a question of sonship, sonship in the supreme place. You can understand it is irrevocable from God's side, but it may not be so in my soul and in the gathering in which I am. Let us get the thought of sonship, and sonship in the supreme place, and everything goes well.
Well, now you see how Nathan is used afresh. I need not turn to the passage in @1 Kings 1, but it is very striking how skilfully Nathan proceeds to get David right, and Bath-sheba right, and finally Adonijah put out of the way. He got David to judge him and remove him, and place Solomon on the throne. He has to do with the very enthronement of the son. Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet are directed to anoint Solomon. How pleased the prophet must have been, for while he served David, he serves Solomon! His great service now is to see that Solomon is on the throne. That is the kind of prophetic ministry that is needed, to see not only that Christ is exalted at the right hand of God, but that the Son is on the throne, and Nathan is used to do it. He has the actual doing of it, to anoint the son Jedidiah under the name of Solomon. Zadok the priest
{230}
and Nathan the prophet anoint him king. The work is done. His great mission is done in that, but then there is the service of God, and so we find what we do not get earlier, that is, in @2 Chronicles 29, Nathan and Gad are engaged in the holy service of God themselves. You will see this, if you will turn to the passage again, verse 25. Hezekiah is king, "And he set the Levites in the house of Jehovah with cymbals, with lutes, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and of Nathan the prophet; for the commandment was of Jehovah through his prophets".
You see there, dear brethren, how Gad and Nathan are themselves actually engaged in the service of God. They merge, as you might say, in David. It brings out how exalted is this service of prophecy. The more you look into it, the more impressed you are. As Peter stands up and speaks in the power of the Spirit freshly come down from heaven, he calls attention to what Joel foretold, and which now had come to pass. God having poured out His Spirit, "your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your elders shall dream with dreams; yea, even upon my bondmen and bondwomen in those days will I pour out of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy", (Acts 2:17,18). Is it not attractive? Does the question not arise in each one's heart. Have I any part in this? It is God calling us to a more exalted line of things than we have hitherto been engaged with. Not simply one *giving a word* , but prophecy with harps, as it were. What does that mean? Take such hymns as the twelfth and fourteenth, and many others like them in our hymn book -- they prophesy. They not only serve for song in the service of God, but for prophesying. They bring God to our souls, and if God is in the singing we shall not allow any natural sentiment in it. Natural sentiment is like the dead fly in the ointment. If God comes into the singing, if there be
{231}
prophesying in it, we shall be preserved, and the trend will be toward heaven. God is leading on the saints in this way. The Spirit of God is here and active in the assembly at the present time, in view of the end, and that God should be worshipped in spirit and in truth. He is also promoting bridal affection for Christ, the most exalted kind, and we do not want to be out of this, dear brethren. Prophesying will help us to get into it, to judge ourselves, even in the *singing* . Is there ever a time that a brother or sister has not to judge himself or herself? When a brother sings the most spiritual hymn, when he gives thanks to God, he has to continue judging himself. It is God coming into the matter, God looking into our hearts. He searches the hearts. Think of that! The Spirit makes intercession with groans that cannot be uttered, but it is in our hearts, and God is looking into our hearts and reading our hearts; for it is a question of what is in our hearts. So that God will have the best from us. Will a man rob God? That is the question. He says to Israel, You have done it. Let us not do it. The scripture shows the way not to rob Him, @Malachi 3:10 - 12. Then He says, "Three times in the year shall all thy males appear before Jehovah thy God", (@Deuteronomy 16:16). It is not disparaging the sisters at all, because in Christianity they have a part in this. It is a spiritual way of speaking. The males represent our best. Anna the prophetess, who did not depart from the temple, serving night and day with fastings and prayers, had part in it. Coming into the temple, Christ, as a Babe, being there, she gave praise to God. Mary, the mother of our Lord, also praised God. She could distinguish between her soul and her spirit. That is the idea, we are searched inwardly, and we know the feelings that are coming up. They are not spurious, they are feelings according to God, they are the product of the Spirit; the Spirit not being grieved in us.
{232}
Now, the verse in @1 Chronicles 25 is what I wish to close with. What I am presenting now is not only to meet conditions in this city, but for each of us, and for every gathering represented, for God is looking for better things. Why should He be robbed? I believe that is why He specifies the males to appear before Him three times in a year; not any given time of their own choice, but on the feast of unleavened bread, the feast of weeks, and the feast of tabernacles. These feasts are to be in the minds of the males as they come up. In this God is saying, I want the very best in Israel. I am entitled to it. Why should you rob Me? Why should the service of God be a light, trivial thing to any of us? Why should we come to the meetings and sit as mere members of a congregation? Why should not our hearts be full of holy matter? Although they cannot speak, yet every sister can *sing* ; and the singing is, in a way, the leading thing in the service of God, even in heaven. Think of that wonderful song I have already alluded to. Why should I be without holy matter in my soul, so as to sing for God's pleasure? If I have it, when a hymn is proposed, I am with it, and join with it in a holy substantial way, my heart searched by the prophetic spirit, it may be in the very hymn itself. God is looking for this. He wants the very best you have, the work of your hands. You will be fully joyful, but so shall He. "He will exult over thee with singing" He says, (@Zephaniah 3:17). I am quoting scripture, and endeavouring to draw the brethren into the current of God's mind as to this matter. He rejoices over us with singing. It is well to inquire how God sings. That is what the scripture says. We have to understand, but there it is.
In this verse in @1 Chronicles 25, we have, "Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with
{233}
psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of the workmen", and so forth. Then we are told in verse 7, "So the number of them, with their brethren that were instructed in the songs of the Lord, even all that were cunning, was two hundred and four score and eight (@1 Chronicles 25:7)". That is twice a hundred and forty-four -- twenty-four times twelve. You see how the Spirit of God brings the divine thoughts into these matters. Here are military men, David and the captains of the host have to do with these matters. You may say. This is not a military matter. Is it not? Everything has to converge on the service of God, even a battle. God must have something out of everything; from all our exercises; so now we have the military man looking after the service of song, and three men brought into evidence -- Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman. Great family men, for the family thought enters into it as also into the hundred and forty-four thousand in the book of Revelation. The idea of twelve enters into it. Here there were two hundred and eighty-eight, and they were instructed, skilled in the service of song. They prophesy -- at least these three men did. They prophesy with harps, as we are told, and with psalteries and with cymbals. Is it not most attractive that with my harp, with my psaltery, or my cymbal I am thinking of God, of what He is, what is due to Him in the service, that He may have the very best there is? The full result of the work of my hands is seen in the feast of tabernacles, where we are made "wholly joyful"; not with mere natural sentiments in the tones, but all the hymns and all the words of the service of God make us joyful and He is joying over us Himself.
Thus we are serving God acceptably at the present time, and also we are in preparation for the rapture. That is what God would effect and have continued in His people. It is no mere theory with us, but a matter of understanding. The apostle says, "I will sing with
{234}
the spirit, but I will sing also with the understanding", (@1 Corinthians 14:15). If we proceed on these lines we shall understand, and we shall be expecting the Lord and be ready for Him when He comes. We speak about the Lord's coming, but if we proceed on these lines we will be in the atmosphere of it anticipatively, and thus will be ready for the actuality of the great event, not taken by surprise. Philip will not be surprised in the rapture; he was raptured in his service. @Acts 8:39. Those who know ecstasy will not be surprised; those who experience being "in the Spirit on the Lord's day (@Revelation 1:10)". It is a question of spiritual power in our souls and spiritual intelligence. So that we are ready for the great and glorious occasion of the coming of the Lord, and our introduction into our heavenly portion, to continue as we have been doing in a little way down here; but then without hindrance in that eternal day.
{235}
MARRIAGE IN THE LORD
@Genesis 22:20 - 24; @Numbers 36:1 - 13, @1 Corinthians 7:39,40
J.T. The verses in Genesis have been suggested because they indicate that God provides beforehand for what is to follow: what may arise in His service amongst His people, and this includes a wife, constitutionally needed; so in view of the need in Abraham's family, that is, in Isaac, the Spirit of God mentions these facts about Nahor's family, in which we have Rebecca introduced. Wives are constantly needed and sought after, which is according to God. Marriages have a great place with Him, a great place in the testimony, that there should be *wholly a right* seed, @Jeremiah 2:21. Hence would-be husbands should approach God as to this, as a matter that concerns Him, and therefore entering into His forethought and consequent provision for such need known to Him beforehand. If this were accepted by brothers and sisters alike, it would preclude mixed marriages, diverse yokes in this sense. It is said, "Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing", (@Proverbs 18:22). But then God has forethought as to it, and would thus provide so that the right person *may* be found. And then parents, as in the following chapters in Genesis, ought to be concerned as to wives for their sons, and husbands for their daughters; the testimony should rule in such exercises and not merely seeking after financial or social advantages.
L.C.C. Are you suggesting that the inheritance should always have a place in our minds in this connection?
J.T. That comes in in Numbers, as we shall see.
E.S.W. Is it in your mind that @Genesis 22 suggests that there is a family provided of God out of which wives should be chosen?
J.T. That is how the matter stands in Genesis. The
{236}
sisterhood in the family of faith. Paul said that he had a right to lead about a sister as wife; a *sister*, then a wife. The patriarchs were marked by that, their wives were their sisters before they were their wives.
A.M.H. Is there a spiritual connection in this scripture in Nahor being a brother of Abraham, so that you would not have a spiritual person marrying an unspiritual one even in fellowship?
J.T. Spirituality is the thought in the family status, not simply nominal fellowship. A person may be nominally in fellowship without a spiritual status. At the same time, fellowship is most important, and if both persons are in fellowship the matter is accepted by the brethren, and they would recognise and commit themselves to it, unless of course there was some specific defect; and then the persons themselves should be concerned about their spiritual stature. Rebecca is introduced here to show us that God *does* provide beforehand for His people. If a brother is to be used in the service as a gift, it is a matter of great importance to God, and if he is to marry, it should be to someone suitable. Paul said, as I have mentioned, that he had a right to take around a sister as wife, as did other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord. Surely God would be concerned about a wife for Paul, if needed. The patriarchs¬ wives were their near relatives; the thought of sisterhood is there -- and surely if God has given a man a gift. He thinks of him long ahead, and if he is to marry it should be to a suitable person; one who is prepared in that way. It is a matter of importance to God. He can do everything; why should He not prepare a suitable wife for a brother seeking one?
G.A.v.S. Has the Song of Solomon any reference to that when it speaks of a sister, a spouse?
J.T. It is Christ speaking there, "I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse", (@Song of Songs 5:1). The principle before us is there, however.
{237}
W.J.H. Would @Isaiah 61:10 come in here, "a bridegroom decketh himself with the priestly turban"? He approaches the matter as thinking for God. If our younger brethren get that outlook in approaching the matter, there would be much more for God in marriages.
J.T. The "priestly turban" would certainly bring him into the attitude *of prayer* about the matter.
E.B.McC. Is it important to see the great concern of Abraham as parent in connection with the oath that the servant is made to take before he leaves to find Rebecca?
J.T. That is a great thing to consider, the parents¬ part in the matter. She was to be of the same family status; that was the chief point with Abraham, also that Isaac should not be taken to where she was, but she was to be brought to him. The brother has the leading position as before God, and the wife becomes subservient to that. @1 Corinthians 7 states that marriage must be "in the Lord".
Ques. You spoke of family status; will you tell us a little more what is in your mind?
J.T. We have been alluding to the fellowship. A person in the fellowship is qualified, unless there be some specific defect, but then there is more than fellowship; the family link, and there is spirituality.
G.A.v.S. Do those spiritual feelings depend upon how far the rights of God are paramount in connection with the matter?
J.T. Yes. The bridegroom decks himself with the priestly turban, which shows he is dignified in a priestly sense. The attire of the high priest involved his intelligence; he had a turban with a plate of gold on which was engraved "Holiness to Jehovah!" and his sons had high caps. So that the man is not only governed by his mind and conscience, his moral judgment, but he has access to God about the matter as in intelligence and dignity.
{238}
J.D.U. Would Abraham's part in it, as stated in @Genesis 18:19, come in: "For I know him that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice, in order that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham what he hath spoken of him"? Does that come in in connection with the parental side?
J.T. If a man is to command his children after him, it would not only be his immediate sons and daughters, but his grandchildren. He would be concerned about their wives and husbands. Abraham dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob. He was concerned about his grandchildren, and he was at least a hundred and sixty years old at that time. He had carried on in this sense right through to the end of his patriarchal service.
G.A.v.S. Would that raise a question as to whom parents allow into their homes when their children are reaching a marriageable age?
J.T. It would, because affiliations should be made in the circle of the fellowship. There is a good deal of recognition of family status after the flesh, involving natural affinity. These things have to be watched, because at times persons are brought into homes, and their company is fostered because of natural affinity, whereas there may be no spiritual link. As to that, I am sure it is important to watch.
F.J.F. Might the parents be careless when the children are young?
J.T. Yes. Natural feelings often govern parents in these matters, and the results do not add to the testimony.
J.D.U. How far has the natural to be taken account of in relation to the family circle?
J.T. We have to take account of age. Disparity of age may occasion trouble. It was said of the daughters of Zelophehad, let them marry *whom they please* , him who is good in their eyes. So that we have to take
{239}
account of the creative side. Although we may be spiritual, we never cease to be creatures of God, the thought of compatibility in this respect must be considered. It cannot be ignored, so parents should not influence children against their natural selection, because we must allow selection. They marry whom they will, but it must be "in the Lord". For a godly Israelite wishing to select a wife, they were a good field to make inquiry in. They spoke "right", Jehovah says.
L.P.M. Do you see it in the parents of Moses in that relation?
J.T. Yes, the father and mother were of the Levitical family.
F.J.F. Will you tell us what "in the Lord" embraces?
J.T. Entire submission to the Lord's authority, *practically* , not merely formal confession.
W.J.H. Would it include 2 Timothy as part of the Lord's commandment, in that we are enjoined to separate from what is to dishonour?
J.T. Just so. How can you seek a wife amongst the sects? Not that I am speaking against them, but the fellowship forbids it. You say. They are Christians, but what is involved in the word Christian? The disciples were first called Christians at Antioch, but they had been *added to the Lord* , not simply a company of disciples. Barnabas and Saul had to do with their instruction as believers, so that we may be sure the authority of the Lord was received into their souls; hence anyone presenting himself or herself to be in fellowship amongst them must recognise the Lord's rights; he cannot belong to a denomination formed by man, where the Lord's authority is not owned.
E.S.W. The scripture referred to in 2 Timothy speaks of those with whom we walk, and we should have no lower standard for a wife than those with whom we walk -- "those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart",(@2 Timothy 2:22).
{240}
G.A.v.S. Does "in the Lord" involve that there is a definite exercise as to coming under the direction and control of Christ, in view of such an important step? Does it indicate that we are subject to the divine will in connection with such a union?
J.T. It is so in every relation. "In the Lord" governs every relation of Christian life, and particularly the marriage relation. How can a marriage be "in the Lord" when one person is not in the fellowship?
Ques. Would the mixed marriages referred to by Nehemiah come in here?
J.T. Quite so. Mixed marriages are one of the outstanding occasions of sorrow amongst the brethren.
A.E.M. You spoke of those in fellowship as potentially suitable to one another, except where a defect exists. Will you say what is in your mind?
J.T. A person may be in the fellowship, but only in it in a restricted way. At Thessalonica the apostle pointed out that if a man did not work he should not eat. If he did not acquiesce in all the apostle wrote, they should shrink from him. I referred to anything like that, anything that disqualifies a person, restricts him in the fellowship.
A.E.M. Have you not found in your experience that careless door-keeping has allowed persons to come in that are dangerous in that way?
J.T. Indeed. When they are in you have to wait for a specific cause to withdraw from them. But anything like that would be the exception, normally those in fellowship are potentially suitable. It is mainly a question then for both of the persons to decide before God whether they are equal spiritually, whether one would detract from the other.
A.L. Is it not in view of the continuance of the family?
J.T. The seed is to be *wholly right* . I know that is to be carried forward to a spiritual level, but 1 Corinthians
{241}
contemplates that the children of believing parents are holy, that is, holy in an external way, not essentially; but their parents are holy as under God. He has had to do with them. These things are before God, and God comes into all of them, hence the importance of spirituality, because that in the parents is sure to enter into the constitution of the children in an influential way.
P.L. Do Aquila and Priscilla suggest that spiritual affinity which finds them in one yoke, one "neck" in the testimony?
J.T. That is to be continued in character as exemplary of what we are speaking of. It has been pointed out that they are mentioned six times in scripture: Aquila first three times out of six. They are viewed on an equality, although she is a subject woman. The Spirit of God mentions Aquila first three times, and Priscilla first three times. A very remarkable fact, and Paul's allusions to them bear out that they were suitable to each other.
W.R.W. Is "in the Lord" suggested in the salutations in Corinthians -- Priscilla and Aquila salute you in the Lord?
J.T. Just so.
F.I. In the case of husband and wife finding something unsuitable in one another, would we say it is a marriage "in the Lord"?
J.T. It requires very keen discernment to pass judgment on such a marriage. There may be certain variations of temperament in husband and wife that God may use for discipline. That is another thing God may provide -- a wife for a brother who is to be distinguished in the testimony; perhaps he may be a strong-minded man and she may have a difficult temperament, and may become a rod for her husband. This is no disparagement of a wife. God's discipline is used to bring out the works of love and self-judgment in the saints. Then we have several instances of marriages in the Scriptures where a wife was more spiritual
{242}
than the husband, and where he scarcely comes into the position of spirituality at all. Take Manoah the father of Samson, he was not equal to his wife. Divine communications came primarily to the wife.
L.P.M. Also Elkanah, the husband of Hannah.
J.T. That is another example. There are several instances; the husband of the Shunammite woman scarcely qualifies as a husband of a spiritual woman, but still God worked out His thought. Nevertheless, in these cases I should not like to pass judgment too readily, because room has to be made for the exceeding grace of God.
Ques. Was not Job's wife used as discipline for Job, and in James we are told that the end of the Lord is reached in relation to Job?
J.T. A good illustration, so that if persons are in fellowship and unless there is something of a very extraordinary nature in the wife or husband, we should not discredit the marriage.
F.I. You could not apply that in relation to one who married one not walking in the fellowship?
J.T. I think it should be laid down that a person not in the fellowship is not suitable as a wife or husband of one of the fellowship. It is a mixed marriage, and ought to be so named. If priestly admonition is applied, priestly investigation having been made, and the person in fellowship refuses to listen to the brethren, it seems to me that such are disqualified for the fellowship.
F.I. Would such an one do damage not only to himself, but to the assembly also by his action?
J.T. Yes. He is carrying the inheritance outside the tribe to which he belongs.
F.J.F. Would such a person have to be withdrawn from?
J.T. That is what I think. Great priestly care would be employed in the way of admonition and pointing out by spiritual instruction that the course is lawless:
{243}
no other word should be used. It is a lawless course. He may not think it, and maintain the plea that the person is a Christian; but it is a lawless course, and if that is brought to his attention carefully and graciously he should be convicted; but if he refuses he is lawless. He is disregarding the word of God as to marriage, and he is refusing to hear the assembly.
S.E.E. You do not make a difference between a brother or sister?
J.T. They should be dealt with on the same principle.
G.A.v.S. Both stand in relation to the law of God.
J.T. It is a question of @1 Corinthians 7: only "in the Lord" is a brother or sister free to marry whom he or she will, and that implies the fellowship.
S.E.E. Would you make a difference in the case of a person not committed to the fellowship in the breaking of bread, yet who is attending the meetings?
J.T. If one is not breaking bread, why is this so? It is disregarding the Lord.
Ques. Is it a serious matter in such a case to extend limited fellowship in a private prayer meeting?
J.T. I do not see how the fellowship is thus maintained. If you look into the matter and analyse it, you will find lawlessness underlying the position. A couple who are Christians entering into marriage and whose faces are in the direction of the fellowship, although not breaking bread, is another matter. I should be free to join in prayer with them. The sons of Joseph take counsel here themselves. @Numbers 36:1 - 4. That is to say, the brethren in this matter have to consider for the inheritance, and a mixed marriage is going to weaken our inheritance, taking what belongs to our tribe to another. Where one of the persons is not in the tribe as a sharer in the inheritance, the position of the locality is weakened by the marriage, for one of the persons is not in the fellowship. The matter is detracting from the fellowship. It is robbing us.
{244}
Ques. Would they be vessels to dishonour?
J.T. It would amount to that.
J.D. @Nehemiah 10:28 - 30 says, "And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites ... and all they that had separated themselves from the peoples of the lands to the law of God, their wives, their sons and their daughters ... joined with their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a curse and into an oath, to walk in the law of God, which had been given by Moses the servant of God, and to keep and do all the commandments of Jehovah our Lord, and his ordinances and his statutes; and that we would not give our daughters to the peoples of the land, nor take their daughters for our sons". Has that a bearing?
J.T. It has. It bears on what we are saying as to the things the brethren arrive at in their counsels on a particular case -- how the fellowship may be affected.
F.W. Would what has been said have a bearing on the attitude of the saints towards a brother engaged to be married to one not in the Lord? Should there be action when a person becomes engaged, rather than wait until they are married?
J.T. Of course an engagement is not binding in the law of the land. It is not marriage, but still when a definite link has been formed, that is the time to take initial steps; only to act finally on the matter before marriage may weaken our position. The circumstances would guide, but the marriage is the full act of lawlessness.
S.E.E. There have been cases which could be cited where such a marriage has taken place, the brother walking happily with us, and has married one not walking with us; no action has been taken and his wife has become a good sister.
J.T. The over-ruling grace of God has come in, but that does not clear the brethren. The Lord is drawing attention to this matter; He is stressing that investigation
{245}
should be made and admonition administered, and for a person to refuse to listen to exercises on these lines makes him unfitted for fellowship. The more you deal with a person who refuses to hear his brethren, the more lawlessness comes to light.
S.H.B. It has been taught amongst us that one engaged has made a vow which is inviolable.
J.T. That is important -- an engagement vow has been made; can it be broken? We will suppose that a person who has made a vow is in fellowship, and he is convicted in his conscience that he has done wrong before God in linking himself with a person unequal to him spiritually; were he to go to the person and lay the whole matter before her, would not God come in for him? There are ways to approach these difficulties. It is more than likely that the other would release him, or be convicted herself. You cannot in this way break a bond in marriage, but it could be done in an engagement if the two are agreeable.
A.E.M. Would you say that the responsibility of the brethren goes back really further than the question of engagement, in that we have to see that the teaching of this is to be before young people -- before their natural affections are engaged?
J.T. That is a very important thing as to instruction in families. Some families are brought up *as prohibitionist* , and they have a conscience on that line, and it is supposed that that conscience must not be offended, but it should *never* be there. Instructions as to *temperance* should, as the truth, be in the family, for every creature of God is good, being sanctified by the word of God and prayer, @1 Timothy 4:4,5. So as to marriage, mothers and fathers are responsible to instruct their children before they come to the age of marriage. God will help us; any effort on that line will bring God in. Why should a young brother seek a wife not in fellowship? Has he been properly instructed?
{246}
A.W. With regard to the children of the saints being holy, how is it so many of them are lost to the testimony?
J.T. Largely because they are not brought up properly. We admit other things for them than what divine teaching enjoins.
W.J.H. The death of the widow's son reminds the mother of her sin, and Elijah restores him consequent upon this, @1 Kings 17:17,18.
A.W. You fall back on the mercy of God.
E.S.W. The question of the sovereignty of God should not be lost sight of. It is a matter of the sovereignty of God if some are lost or saved.
J.T. The sovereignty of God can be counted on, but then there is the parents¬ watchfulness. How unfaithfulness in parents has contributed to what is in households!
W.F.S. If that is brought before a young person, and he or she has not hearkened to the instruction of the parents or the brethren, what would be done then?
J.T. @Deuteronomy 21:18 - 21 contemplates such a condition.
A.E.M. While we are speaking of cases of those lost through mixed marriages, are we not losing many young men through the universities or higher education?
J.T. Indeed we are, and the question often comes up in one's mind -- why do parents send their children to universities? Is it solely that their children should have a means of livelihood? or is there a fleshly thought of having distinction in the family?
E.S.W. What you mean is that the question of motive must come into view.
J.T. I am not judging the brethren, because very many brothers have gone through university courses. I am only speaking now as to motives. Why are they sending their children to institutions where the enemy has a big advantage?
J.D.U. Baptism would beget exercise as to this matter.
{247}
J.T. Yes, that we should be consistent with it as to our houses.
W.J.H. Would you say a word regarding a situation that frequently arises. Persons having marriage in mind, or for other reasons, formally withdraw from us so as to reach their end. Some feel we should accept this; they leave us, as scripture says, "they went out".
J.T. I do not think such conduct should be let off in that way. The assembly is to reflect the judgment of heaven, and the person who has come nominally into fellowship has been recognised in that way in heaven, and there must be some balance to that. He can never be what he was before he came into fellowship; if he goes out there is something that has been recorded against him in heaven and the assembly should reflect that; and it seems to me the more you look into such a case the more evil you will find. It will often lead to other things. Investigation should be made of every such mention of going out of fellowship. It is apostasy in principle, it is not a light matter. They may not think so, but those of us truly in the position know that it is so, and it should be brought to their attention, and the more you investigate the case the more it will appear that *lawlessness* is at the bottom of it.
A.M.H. Is it departing from the living God?
J.T. "If any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him (@Hebrews 10:38)". It is in principle apostasy. Why should we allow that to pass without a judgment? "God has judged your judgment" (@Revelation 18:20); why should we not have a judgment?
L.C.C. Does not the Lord allow the thing to be brought up before the brethren generally so that the individual and the brethren might be helped?
J.T. Quite so, a rebuke before all that others may fear.
C.A.I. What would be the consequent attitude of the brethren towards such an one?
{248}
J.T. They go from us and draw back. We should, as judging the matter, regard them as under assembly judgment.
E.S.W. How far should we be governed by Leviticus in relation to marriage?
J.T. It is remarkable how clearly scripture establishes its principles. In @Leviticus 18, marriage in a variety of ways is prohibited. That ought to be observed in relation to our subject.
J.S.D. What would you say where the law of the land goes beyond @Leviticus 18?
J.T. I should go by scripture. The law is in the hands of the priests, so that as priests we are custodians of the law. It is a question of spiritual judgment; the letter kills, the Spirit gives life. It is a question of priestly judgment in all cases. @Leviticus 18 gives a list of persons who are not to be linked in marriage; we can only understand scripture by the help of the Spirit of God. It is quite right, of course, to discuss what scripture says, and the Lord never leaves us in the dark; He says that "the scripture cannot be broken (@John 10:35)". In the types we have what is entirely spiritual; the priests, those guided by the Spirit of God, know generally what scripture teaches on any matter, @Malachi 2: 4 - 7. Then @1 Corinthians 7 distinguishes between the commandment of the Lord and spiritual judgment in marital matters, and admits the importance of the latter as to points concerning which scripture is silent in a literal sense.
R.T. As to our attitude towards a young man coming to the meeting but not breaking bread, should he be invited to our homes?
J.T. If he is a likely case you try to help him. He should not be encouraged to enter into relationships in the household until the spiritual matter is settled. It is a matter of spiritual equality, not natural equality. The types govern these cases and the Lord would have us have recourse to the temple in considering them.
{249}
F.W. In regard to persons who grow cold and keep away from the meeting, what should govern us in regard to them? They may not have committed themselves to evil and yet are not coming to the meetings. I think you said that those that did not keep the passover were cut off amongst the people of Israel.
J.T. That is what I think. A specific law governing the case is @Numbers 9:13.
F.W. Does it involve an assembly meeting?
J.T. Certainly; you will find other things if you investigate carefully.
Ques. Is such a wicked person?
J.T. If he refuses to respond to the authority of the Lord, what is he? A lawless person is a wicked person.
W.J.H. In a city like this, when a meeting of assembly character is called to deal with evil, often not more than a quarter of the brethren can come, but the Lord generally helps and a judgment is reached and we never hear any more in a public way. Some feel that does not provide for others who cannot be present to be exercised, and yet we have hesitated to extend the matter.
J.T. Why are others not present?
W.J.H. Partly because they are unable to come, and frequently the room in which the meeting is held cannot hold those who otherwise might be present.
J.T. Absence at such meetings is often regarded lightly, but this is humbling, all should be present.
H.D.T. Is there anything wrong in principle in a report being given to the saints of what has taken place at the assembly meeting? -- the assembly meeting finalises a matter.
J.T. There is nothing wrong in principle, only it should be accompanied by some admonition to those who were not present!
A.M.H. The main difficulty is to get a room large enough with the necessary privacy.
{250}
J.T. I have observed that an assembly meeting called after a fellowship meeting is very effective. Most of the brethren are generally there and the matter is settled.
J.S.G. How would you arrange for those not breaking bread?
J.T. Ask them to withdraw.
Ques. Is there an obligation on all the saints to be present?
J.T. It is an obligation; all ought to be present.
Ques. Would a representative from each meeting in the city be right?
J.T. There is no suggestion in @1 Corinthians 5 of representation. The apostle does not say "the whole assembly", but how could you be in Corinth knowing that such a meeting was being held and fail to be present? It would be your obligation to be there.
P.L. "They were all with one accord in Solomon's porch", @Acts 5:12.
N.B.S. A discipline meeting need not necessarily be very long. Would @1 Corinthians 14 bear on such a meeting, and would two or three words be necessary?
J.T. You are contemplating an assembly meeting for discipline and the bearing of a prophetic word at such a time.
N.B.S. We wait upon the Lord for a word which would help the judgment of the saints. Sometimes a number of brothers refer to scriptures. I was thinking that we should be ready to accept a prophetic word.
J.T. Three would be ample, two more suitable, and perhaps one most suitable. Cumbersomeness should be avoided in such a meeting. @1 Corinthians 5 and @Acts 5 indicate the opposite of much length. Of course patient investigation by brothers precedes the assembly meeting for discipline.
A.M.H. I suppose it is a matter of witness, laying out
{251}
the particulars of the case. I gather that all *that* should be done at the care meeting and one person is sufficient to give a summary of what was given to the care meeting.
J.T. One hundred brothers in Sydney look into a matter, and investigation is made; one brother well known states the case to the assembly, and another confirms it. I have no objection to a second, but I would accept what the one brother said. If it is not in accordance with facts the brethren, being present, would say so.
A.E.M. Would you regard the care meeting as arriving at something definite in connection with such a case without taking on judicial function, or is it that the brothers in a city get the facts and then wait for something from the Lord?
J.T. The whole matter is tentative until we reach the assembly; but the brother who states the case would convey what the brothers in care have determined should be brought before the conscience of the assembly; then a word conveying the mind of God from the Scriptures aids the assembly in its judgment. James says, "I judge", @Acts 15:19, and the assembly endorses what James said. Peter and he had set out the mind of God in the matter.
Ques. If a scripture has been read to govern a position, and another scripture indicates a different line, how would you meet the position?
J.T. It is a divided state which should never exist.
S.E.E. Should a matter be brought before the assembly for judgment before brothers in care had reached a conclusion?
J.T. @Acts 15 says that the apostles and elders came together to consider the matter. If anyone has anything that should be brought before such a meeting, he should state it there. In the multitude of counsellors there is safety. @Proverbs 11:14. If we are subject to
{252}
the Lord and to one another, we shall arrive at the truth, and the brother or brothers who present the matter to the assembly will, as dependent on Him, be helped of the Lord to convey the mind of God and so a true judgment will be reached.

1940. (.Volume 149).
DIVINE CONFIDENCE IN THE SAINTS
@Matthew 18:17 - 20
J.T. What is in mind is to look at Matthew from the standpoint of the divine confidence placed in the saints under given conditions. It seems to appear in this gospel peculiarly because of the administrative truth that enters into it; confidence is seen, I think, throughout. The Lord says at the end, without stating any condition, that He would be with them always, and Joseph, in chapter 2, seems to represent what can be confided in divinely: he qualifies in his uprightness, he is entrusted with the Son of God as a Babe. He had not only qualified in a moral way beforehand, but the history shows that he was equal to the trust, taking the Child and His mother into Egypt and coming back and employing vigilance to protect the Child. I suggested these verses because they bring all that thought into assembly administration; what the Lord says involves reliability in the assembly, and then in the "two of you". Verse 20 seems to bring in the thought of help in answer to prayer; the Lord being in the midst of the two or three, "For where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them".
W.W. In regard to a person who would not hearken to the voice of the assembly, the Lord says, "Let him be to thee as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer". I had looked upon that as involving that, if a person disregards the voice of the assembly, he stands as one unfit for Christian fellowship and not to be walked with, is that so?
J.T. Yes, exactly. It is a matter taken up severally by
{254}
each one of the assembly; it does not go so far as what the assembly does, the Lord does not tell us what the assembly will do, it is what you or I should do, and that is how the reliability works out; that each of us sees to that; that one does not think of oneself as more gracious than others, in perhaps making up to the man and making much of him, exercising what might be called grace towards him. I think each individual is addressed, and unity is maintained, and reliability is seen, in each one maintaining what is right in the matter; no one lagging behind the others, no one failing in due recognition of the assembly's place. We are to be concerned as to maintaining the assembly in its dignity, what the Lord places on it; it is a great matter, each one is to support it. It is a question of reliability in these cases. Sometimes various opinions arise, and the assembly becomes despised through what is done by some.
D.L.H. Is not the assembly the vessel in which the full grace of God is set forth today?
J.T. I am sure that is right, and any action of the assembly should have that in mind. Unless we can show unmistakably that there is any want of grace in its attitude or service or administration, the point is to be loyal, I think; let the assembly, as acting for God, stand out in its dignity as heaven's representative; heaven having full confidence in it. The Lord does not suggest a question as to any error on the part of the assembly, either as to this, or as to the binding and loosing.
D.L.H. Is not the point that, if the full volume of divine grace has been set forth in the effort to gain the individual offender and has failed, the case is hopeless, and the offender is regarded practically as a heathen man or a tax-gatherer?
J.T. If you put the "if" in there, that is, you say. *If* the full volume of grace has been shown, and in one
{255}
way *we* ought to, as allowing for our weakness, but the Lord does not contemplate that even.
E.S.H. Does the care meeting come in here?
J.T. It is not mentioned at all; it is the offended brother and the offender and the witnesses, two or three others, and the assembly. The Lord, in divine wisdom, leaves the "if" out as regards the reliability of the assembly; it only refers to the offending brother, it is applicable there. It might apply to a care meeting, but it is any two or three who are gathered together unto the Lord's name. I should not exclude sisters from the "two or three", or from the "two of you".
P.L. It is love's obligation to be the custodian of the integrity and inviolability of the throne in the great vessel of rule.
J.T. Loyalty to the assembly's position and heaven's confidence in it enter into this on the part of each of us. The "thee" would be any one of us, and if each one is true, then there will be no differences of judgment, or of attitude towards the erring one. I think we ought to keep in mind that abstractly the assembly is reliable and the saints are reliable, for we are entitled to look at the saints in an abstract way. John's account of the first visit of the Lord to the saints after He arose shows this and does not involve any discrepancy.
M.W.B. Love would not weaken the action of the assembly, nor detract from the confidence that would be rightly placed in it.
J.T. It would not, the assembly is right *in the abstract* ; details do not alter that.
Ques. Would the assembly be representative of God in that way in relation to the matter?
J.T. Quite so -- what a great thing that is! How can heaven confide in something here aside from reliability? The position of the assembly is abstractly right, but that is to be proved by the way in which each person moves, by what is there.
{256}
Eu.R. When you speak of the two or three being of the assembly, have you in mind that the gates of hades cannot prevail against it?
J.T. Yes, how can the gates of hades prevail against this?
Ques. Has there not been a tendency at times to judge of things too hastily? The last thing some have done is to enquire.
J.T. Yes, we had a case like that recently. The saints said they did not know what the basis of the action was, in another town. They are their neighbours, and the thing had happened two years ago. Why did they not go and find out? Were they sure of what they were objecting to?
A.S.L. This would be an individual matter; one has trespassed and the matter is gone into. What would be the position of such an one in regard to the assembly?
J.T. There is a sequel to all this, and that must be gone through with, all the *thees* come together. The matter is settled as regards the assembly, the assembly status is maintained, let us not darken or becloud that. The dispensation is lost if the assembly's position is not maintained abstractly; we must arrive at that in some way or all goes; if we are loyal we shall.
P.L. So that a divergence of judgment is nothing short of a thrust of the foe against this vessel.
J.T. It is the same as an attack on Christ.
M.W.B. Would you regard this course as normal to *every* kind of offence, of sin, in the early stages of dealing with it? I was linking it with. Thou shalt not suffer sin to remain on thy neighbour. "Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart; thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him ... . thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself", (@Leviticus 19:17, 18). So, if sin is in any way in evidence, would this apply to the initial way of dealing with it?
{257}
J.T. It indicates that great care is to be taken to avoid taking it to the assembly; then, if it has to be taken, to have all the facts, so that reliability is reached. Then there is binding and loosing. Prayer is the next thing based on two of you agreeing, prayer is taken account of, that must underlie the reliability expressed in the assembly. Then, "where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them". The position is thereby fortified and secured by the Lord being in the midst of the two or three gathered together to His name.
Ques. Whilst administrative judgment is not referred to, does it involve that a person who is judged to be unfit for the assembly is as one of the nations or a tax-gatherer? You would not walk with that person?
J.T. Quite so. Heaven watches what happens. You meet him on the street -- what are you going to do? Then another brother meets him -- what will he do? Heaven is looking on. Are all true? Reliability is placed in the assembly. Are all protecting what the assembly says? For we ought to see what Matthew has in mind that, Christ having gone from the scene (although Matthew does not *say* He ascended), the whole position now involves the assembly. We must never lose sight of it, though it may be an abstract thought.
J.McD. Would Paul's appeal to the Corinthians to remember that they were God's temple, and that the saints shall judge the world and angels, be an endeavour to give the assembly its right place in their minds?
J.T. Quite so, and it says, "Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, according as ye are unleavened" -- (@1 Corinthians 5:7)not as 'ye *might be'*, but "as ye *are* unleavened". I think that helps, for the old leaven would interfere with the working of the assembly.
Ques. Does the "two of you" suggest the quality of the assembly -- reliability of that kind?
J.T. That is right, that they agree and pray.
{258}
Ques. Is that agreement connected with assembly matters only, would you say?
J.T. I should think so, whatever would affect the assembly.
A.B. Would the two agreeing suggest the way the process is reached? Things might be obscured in the early stages of the matter, but they are pursued till there is an agreement reached?
J.T. Yes. We are to get underneath what may be more or less confused. The idea is to bring out the basic features of the assembly, what can be reckoned on; what heaven can confide in. We must consider how heaven is affected and how the Father is regarding all this. "Whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens". The Father has something in that, in the two, that is the "two of you". These are the kind of people that heaven is relying upon, but then they depend on heaven, they depend on the Father. How will He help? I think the "two of you" is the explanation of how it comes about -- "it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens. For where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them". That is their resource.
W.S. So that the Lord has His part in any judgment of this kind. He has taken on the matter as those together are really in line with His mind.
J.T. Yes, the disciples understood how He used to be amongst them, coming in and going out, as Peter says. He was ever accessible and ready to help.
H.D.T. So that nothing would be arrived at without Him.
J.T. No, they would not have arrived at any matter of importance without the Lord, when He was here. The "for", it seems to me, links on with the prayer of the two. Things come round that way; the Father will work in answer to the asking, and then there is this
{259}
resource, the Lord known in the midst of the two or three. The whole principle of the dispensation is set aside where there is disloyalty, and yet there are those who think nothing of questioning a thing instead of going to the root of the matter.
M.W.B. The "for" casts the lustre and power of verse 20 over the preceding one.
J.T. That is right.
J.S.E. Does the word, "gathered together unto my name" involve the thought of loyalty you have referred to?
J.T. Quite so, it is loyalty to His name. It would challenge brothers who have a fixed judgment before a matter is put to the assembly. The Lord is there and He would have the last word. Do not be too sure of your individual judgment before the meeting; it would be better to wait a bit.
J.S.E. Have I not to learn that, in an assembly matter, I am not entitled to an individual judgment?
J.T. You had better wait and let the Lord have the last word, leave it open in your mind.
Ques. Ought there not to be some consciousness of the presence of the Lord? It is not merely abstract.
J.T. It is "in the midst of *them*" If it were simply "in the midst", as in @John 20, you might leave it open, it would be a more general thought, but it is in the midst of them, it is those very persons. The Lord came in and went out amongst them. We have known it before, they would say -- and things would be settled, the Lord's very presence would elucidate the matter.
Rem. It would determine our behaviour when together.
J.T. Yes, often a word would settle the matter; He might use you or any one.
P.L. Would it be like the glory appearing at the door of the tabernacle in various crises in Numbers?
J.T. It would. One has often seen it -- you have, I am sure -- how matters are settled.
{260}
P.H.H. If you tell the assembly, there will be some judgment forthcoming, for it immediately says, "if also he will not listen to the assembly .."
J.T. Yes, there will be a judgment, the Lord had nothing less in mind than a perfect state of things down here. We must begin in the abstract for that, but it is there, there is no "if" at all, it will happen. It is very comforting.
P.H.H. One of the young men telling Abigail about the difficulty with Nabal would be in a way the same principle.
J.T. Quite so -- put the information where it belongs. She represents the assembly there in type, the young man was loyal, he understood the position. He was not a "Nabal" man, he was an "Abigail" man, he was loyal to her, for she comes in as Samuel dies, she is presented as qualified, having a good understanding, and the young man knows where to put the matter.
H.D.T. Do you mean her introduction as Samuel dies involves that judgment continues?
J.T. Quite so. Samuel moved in circuits -- they are ended, but there is an Abigail; and that is what the Lord would bring into Matthew, and it stands. Telling the assembly involves the assembly being specially convened. You wait to hear what the assembly has to say -- whatever it is. It is formally stated that the assembly has ears. @Acts 11:22, and it is communicated to by one who may be regarded as an ear; and of course the ear is not everything, there is the seeing also as we get in the figure in 1 Corinthians. You must have the whole idea of the five senses and you must convene the assembly for that. The Lord does not say. If it says the right thing, but what it says is to be listened to. The Lord is bringing out what the assembly is administratively. Let us not talk about things being obscured; let us understand what He has in His mind and how the thing is to be verified. Can it be verified? Is there such
{261}
a thing? The Lord has been working all these years, to keep the assembly, as it is in His mind, and that we might be loyal to it.
Ques. Would you look at this in an entirely local way?
J.T. Well, the assembly is never looked at as administering, save in a local sense. The assembly is brought in first, then, in verse 19, the "again" would provide for what may be done by the "two of you". @John 14:23 brings it down to one person, he does not speak of the assembly formally, but it has, I believe, the same result. It is not lost sight of, but Matthew is dealing with two.
Eu.R. If there are fifty or five hundred in a place, every brother or sister would need to test their relations as to whether they are in this character toward every other brother or sister.
J.T. Quite so, heaven is looking for those two.
D.L.H. Is not that a great encouragement to any godly person who is exercised about assembly matters that, if there is a case that involves one's brethren, spiritual persons are encouraged to come together and make it a matter of prayer before the Lord as connected with His interests?
J.T. I am sure that has often been verified in our experience, and then we have the way it works out: the way heaven answers, taking account of this principle of gathering together in My name. We are coming round to a sort of Millo-rampart, citadel of power, @2 Samuel 5:9. They are gathered together there, Satan cannot get in there at all.
M.P. Does that involve love? Love and judgment go together, there is nothing inconsistent between love and divine judgment.
J.T. What can you leave out? You have the Urim and the Thummim there and you have the military position there; the Lord will be anything that is necessary.
{262}
M.W.B. Would the thought of one being put in ward be that the mind of the Lord might be known?
J.T. Quite so, and the priests would be there too. You do not get everything here, but you get the Lord in the midst of the two or three -- what will He not be there? He will be what is necessary.
L.D.M. Would power come in in naming the thing? "As his name is, so is he" (@1 Samuel 25:25) -- Abigail named the thing.
J.T. Things should be named, and room made for everything that is right, we are not to be afraid of offending one another, for confidence is the underlying thing. If the Lord is there, whatever is right you can say it and there will be power in it. The Lord says, I will give effect to anything that is right, I am here to serve you, but you are doing it. You must have power here to carry out heaven's behests. See what a circle you have -- "where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst" -- what can He not be to us? The Lord can be anything to us that is necessary, and you are at perfect liberty to say what is right.
C.H. "Whatsoever ... they shall ask" -- that involves the saints understanding what may be required in any exigency.
J.T. Quite so, we are brought into a wide sphere. As things are said that are right, the Lord is there to support them.
W.C. Would it be like Moses, king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people were gathered together, @Deuteronomy 33:5?
J.T. Quite so, he had plenty of room. Aaron and Miriam were not whispering about that coloured woman, they could not open their mouths there where he is king. David said, "I am ... king over Israel" (@2 Samuel 19:22), and the Lord is king where two or three are gathered together unto His name. The Lord wants what He is saying to stand out in our souls, that
{263}
"where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them". A loyal man says. Well, all is settled there, we need not have any anxiety about the matter.
H.D.T. It does not mean, I suppose, that enquiry about the matter is not to be made in certain cases, but the basis would be that abstractly the assembly is right.
J.T. Yes, exactly, a great deal has to be brought in if we are to meet current happenings, but I think the Lord would have us to see the dignity of what we are speaking of. The next thing is, the matter is laid before the Father and that settles the whole thing. What will happen in detail we have to wait for; this brother and that brother say something -- that is right, and the Lord is there and giving effect to it through what is said.
H.D.T. So Jehoshaphat said, "Be strong and do it, and Jehovah will be with the good", (@2 Chronicles 19:11).
J.T. Quite so. "I am with thee ... in all places whither thou goest (@Genesis 28:15)". Heaven has confidence in a man or in a company of persons like that.
Eu.R. Must we not be prepared at any moment for the Lord coming in with His countenance as the sun? We must be ready for everything to come out, and not be deterred by exposure. @Revelation 1:16.
J.T. Yes, and we have in the same book, the woman clothed with the sun -- Christ is reflected in us.
M.W.B. Will you say a little about the expression, "gathered together" being used instead of "assembled"?
J.T. There is a sense of power operating in the word "gathered". These people are gatherable, the Lord can act on them in this way; in going to the meeting place we find there is something operating.
P.L. Would it be seen in the book of Ruth? Boaz says, "Thou, such a one, turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside and sat down (@Ruth 4:1)". Were they gatherable?
{264}
J.T. Quite so, they had no question about it.
P.L. Naomi says, "the man will not rest until he have completed the matter this day" (@Ruth 3:18) -- nothing left over.
J.T. Quite so, you can see what influences were operating there. Naomi had the thought of something happening, and then she knew what would happen following on that, and it did happen. *He* (that is, Boaz) went into the city, Ruth 3:15 -- that is the idea, and everything happens, there is no discrepancy at all.
P.L. So would our gatherings of this kind bear on the love matters of Christ and warrant His having confidence in us, that we should be allowed to handle His affairs.
J.T. It is a great matter to see the influences that are at work. Sisters are brought into it, they influence their husbands. Spiritual instinct in a sister helps greatly, and all that enters into this word "gathered". Influences are at work in the saints so that they are together as gathered. It is a condition involving the influences that have been at work to bring this about. The matter will be settled when these brothers or sisters sit down together. That word "gathered" takes the place of "you", they are *gathered* . Take that young man talking to Abigail, what influence he has! Look at his face, listen to what he says, that man is under right influences. Satan has nothing to say to that man, he is shut out. People may come in and say, I am not sure of that judgment, but the matter will bear investigation. In Matthew here the Lord is among them as qualified by heaven. He has taken a form for that purpose. The thing is carried out, as you might say, by the One who made the universe. The Lord in the midst of two or three has taken a condition in which He can be anything necessary for the moment, whatever it be.
G.A.L. Would the intervention of angels be more than providential?
{265}
J.T. Well, they ministered to the Lord in an hour of weakness in Gethsemane very intimately. "Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out for service on account of those who shall inherit salvation?" (@Hebrews 1:14). They would have power over your body as you come into a meeting to keep you right. All these good and blessed influences are at work.
H.D.T. That word "strengthen" in @Luke 22 has the force of strengthening or giving power inwardly. I thought it is rather remarkable it should be said of the Lord that an angel appeared to Him from heaven to strengthen Him.
J.T. That is interesting and helpful. You cannot limit them. We know they see the all-various wisdom of God worked out in the assembly, but their services are very intimate. You come to a meeting with a bad headache, perhaps, but you are helped and able to take part. What a triumph that is!
P.L. They may be peculiarly active at the moment amid the present turmoil, allowing our gathering together.
Ques. I would like help as to the force in @Hebrews 12 of the angels being spoken of in the way they are. "Ye have come to ... myriads of angels, the universal gathering (@Hebrews 12:22,23)".
J.T. It is the general thought, I think, of their service -- the large number -- it is the general thought, they are functioning in relation to one another, they are not simply isolated. What is seen in @Hebrews 12 is the great spiritual system that God has in mind that we have come to now, anticipative of course of what will be literal in the future, but the great function of the angels is in mind, they are acting in a systematic way, and we can reckon on them never to fail in what is needed. It strengthens us greatly, they are ready to serve us now, they are sent out for ministry on account of those who are heirs of salvation, so they will not
{266}
miss anything, we shall find the help they can give us.
P.L. The word to Daniel is that Michael is *your* prince: does that bear on this?
J.T. Certainly. Gabriel is a priestly angel and he knows what to do; Michael does, too, but they work together.
M.P. There is a passage in Zechariah in which one angel says to another, "Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited (@Zechariah 2:4)". They are concerning themselves as to Jerusalem.
J.T. Quite so, it is remarkable how intelligent they are.
Ques. In @Daniel 10, Michael and others are active in relation to the kings, and one comes to tell Daniel. Would that be in the providence of God, in relation to the legislation in the various countries of the world? Do you think that would show the intervention of angelic power on behalf of the saints?
J.T. Quite so, acting on men, in functioning. It is very comforting. Those things in @Hebrews 12 are thus intelligible to us, they enter into our calculations and prayers.
H.D.T. It says of Daniel that he was in a deep stupor and the angel touched him and set him up. Do you think the thing was overpowering and he was strengthened physically by angel ministration to take it in?
J.T. Quite so. The man is hardly able to stand up to take the thing in until the angel helps him. "Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and thirty-five days!" (@Daniel 12:12) -- *waiteth* and *cometh* to it. The Old Testament makes a good deal of angels. The law was given by the disposition of angels, an angel came to Gideon, but then it was Jehovah. The whole Mosaic system was supplied by angelic means, but now things come through Christ,
{267}
but angels are not set aside, they are sent out - not simply acting according to @Hebrews 12 -- but sent out on account of those who shall inherit salvation. An angel would be always interested in an heir of salvation, he knows him.
P.L. Do they not afford, in their unjealous character, a model for us? Having acted in such a distinguished way in previous dispensations, they are now ready, in this one, to take their appointed and relatively inferior part; the assembly having the great place in it?
J.T. In regard to angelic service we have in @Matthew 1:20 "an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream", and tells Joseph what to do -- "Fear not to take to thee Mary, thy wife, for that which is begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit", and he tells him more, and then in chapter 2, we have, in verse 13, "they having departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appears in a dream to Joseph, saying. Arise, take to thee the little child and his mother, and flee into Egypt" (@Matthew 2:13); and then again, verse 19 says, "Herod having died, behold, an angel of the Lord appears in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, Arise, take to thee the little child and its mother, and go into the land of Israel(@Matthew 2:19);". Now I think that chapter shows us how they come into our times and how intelligent they are, and if we have come to them, as we have -- the universal gathering -- they are called upon to operate accordingly; we count on them, for scripture shows plainly enough how they are available for service in connection with the testimony.
J.S.E. The Lord says He could have asked His Father for more than twelve legions of angels?
J.T. Yes, and the Lord says, too. Their angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven -- these little babies. See how well we are cared for!
J.S.E. Is it right to link the angels with the rights of God in government as associated with Matthew?
{268}
Would this line of truth in Matthew set us free from being merely passive when a matter has to be faced?
J.T. I think so. The mind of God is going through whatever it is, it is as sure as anything.
J.S.E. There is nothing presented in this section between the lawlessness of the offender and the loyalty of "thee" -- "let him be to thee ..."
J.T. It brings each one of us into the thing. Loyalty will soon show itself.
P.L. These test cases lay bare the absence, or presence, of assembly fibre.
J.T. That is what the Lord's words here indicate, I think. He would cause the assembly to stand out and test every one. "Let him be to thee". Who is the antecedent to "thee"? Is it the offended brother only? I think not. I think it is anyone of the assembly, every one is tested by it.
H.D.T. Every one is to keep rank.
J.T. That is what it means. I do not want to be disloyal to the assembly.
Eu.R. Was the woman of Sarepta on the line of assembly fibre?
J.T. Yes. She is first of all directed from a wrong channel of thought. She thought to eat and *die* , but the prophetic ministry puts her on the line of *life* . Then the prophet comes in and the meal does not run out, so she is really material there. She is like most of us, not prepared to move at the outset, but still there is something there in the abstract that prophetic ministry will bring to light; prophetic ministry is what God is using now to put our minds on right lines. We must never lose sight of the thought that there is such a thing as the assembly.
Eu.R. If moral questions are faced and cleared, there is in result a little cake in every locality.
J.T. Quite so, and it is. Make it for me first; when he saw her moving he said that, and she did not question
{269}
it, but no doubt if he had said that to her as he met her first, she would have questioned it. It is not abstract now -- it is made. The little cake is something tangible. The prophet's rights are considered.
H.D.T. You mean a concrete expression of the real thing -- the assembly.
Ques. Would the Lord have reliability in mind in the end of @Matthew 4 when He selected the fishermen?
J.T. Yes-"I will make you (@Matthew 4:19)", not *'If I can I will* make you'. He knew what they were and what they would be.
{270}
THE LORD'S COMING (1)
@1 Thessalonians 4: 1 - 18
H.F.N. Understanding that it is on the mind of the brethren to take up the thought of the Lord's coming, I thought we might consider the rapture as presented in @1 Thessalonians 4, as well as what precedes it in the early part of the chapter. It is the Enoch chapter of the New Testament. The Spirit of God says of Enoch, "And Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him", (@Genesis 5:24). Then there is the striking reference to Enoch in @Hebrews 11:5, "By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him; for before his translation he has the testimony that he had pleased God". The opening part of the chapter before us gives in embryo what was developed later in the ministry of Paul. First, we have a reference to the thought of God's will: "For this is the will of God, even your sanctification", verse 3; then to the calling: "for God has not called us to uncleanness, but in sanctification", verse 7. The third thought that comes before us is that "God ... has given also his Holy Spirit to you", verse 8; so that we are brought to this supreme thought -- the gift of the Spirit. And then the fourth thing is that each one of us has been the subject of divine teaching: "For ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another", verse 9. These suggestions really lay the basis for the introduction of the great thought of the rapture.
I think we would all agree that the Lord is bringing about, ere the moment of the rapture arrives, the development of bridal affections and a state that is pleasing to Him. Our chapter opens with the reminder to these Thessalonian babes, "even as ye have received
{271}
from us how ye ought to walk and please God", verse 1. The truth of the rapture is brought in at the end, but first, the Lord would bring about a state of things that is pleasing to Himself; an atmosphere of love and affection and conditions that are pleasing to God. The Lord will translate what pleases Him.
J.T.Jr. Your allusion to Enoch greatly helps, for it not only brings out the thought of God's pleasure in what is translated, but Enoch also prophesied concerning the coming of the Lord, and His dealing with ungodliness, as we read in Jude.
H.F.N. So that you feel the importance of each one of us, in view of the rapture, cultivating a walk with God. In the book of Genesis, the Spirit of God refers to three different individuals, of whom it is said that they walked with God. The first is to Enoch, as we have been remarking, and then we have a reference to Noah, who amid the corruption that was in the world, walked with God. When we come to Abram, we have the divine standard in regard to our walk, for God said to him: "walk before my face, and be perfect", (@Genesis 17:1). Then, Jacob refers at the close of his life to the God before whom his fathers Abraham and Isaac had walked. @Genesis 48:15. The beloved apostle did not put a heavy burden on the young saints at Thessalonica, but exhorted them that they should know how to *walk* and to please God.
J.T.Jr. The apostle almost immediately refers to the fact that we are to possess our vessels "in sanctification and honour", verse 4. Enoch's prophecy would warn us and help us to reach the mind of God as to this.
A.B.P. Would it be right to say that the transfiguration corresponded in a sense with what was seen in Enoch? The glory, as it were, claimed Him. God claimed the One in whom He had found His pleasure.
H.F.N. I am sure that is so. Each one of us is challenged in view of the translation, that we might seek to
{272}
walk and to please God. Enoch's was a life of communion in which God was pleased; he was really taken out of the scene as an expression of God's pleasure in him, but when we come to Noah, it is rather the side of witness to a world of corruption and violence. Enoch's life made very little public history, but Noah walked with God and was sustained in a public position amidst the corruption and violence that filled the scene.
A.N.W. "Ungodliness" is the word Jude stresses as characterising the world in which Enoch lived.
C.H.M. Do you think Noah would be, in a sense, the counterpart of Enoch? God would have both sides, communion with Himself, and then the public testimony in the world.
H.F.N. That is what one had thought; Enoch represents the communion side, and Noah our public walk amidst the corruption and violence that is in this scene.
Ques. Is the collective position referred to here? All the saints in Thessalonica were walking righteously.
H.F.N. They are spoken of in that way, but are exhorted to abound still more. They are spoken of as "babes", but they are very lovable babes. The apostle in his reference to their walk really speaks of the great results of his teaching, and so the first thought in our chapter is how we are to walk and to please God. It is a large subject and there is very much said in the scriptures concerning it. Then, following that, the apostle calls attention to God's will. I thought we might see how, in the apostle's teaching, he develops the great thought of the will of God, in its bearing upon the translation of the saints from this scene.
A.R. What have you in mind in relation to the will of God?
H.F.N. I was thinking of how the will of God was developed in the apostle's teaching. We see the thought here so distinctly in embryo, but then, in @Romans 12,
{273}
we are called upon to prove the will of God as having presented our bodies "a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God", @Romans 12:1. We are to "prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God", @Romans 12:2. I suppose the will of God in this sense has reference to us as seen in relation to the wilderness, but when we come to the epistle to the Colossians the thought of the will of God is enlarged. The apostle prayed for them that they might be "filled with the full knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding", @Colossians 1:9. I suppose that would have reference to the will of God in relation to the thought of the body, for the truth of the body is brought in, but when we come to @Ephesians 1, we have mention of the *good pleasure* of His will in verse 6, the *mystery* of His will in verse 9, and the *counsel* of His will in verse 11. The will of God is seen there in relation to the whole universe. I believe the Spirit of God would give these Thessalonian saints an *impression* as to the will of God, and if we get a spiritual impression through ministry, and follow it up, much more will open up to us. So, in view of the rapture the apostle would emphasise the importance of our being controlled and governed by the will of God, while we await the Lord Jesus from heaven.
A.F.M. It would give one a consciousness of security in the knowledge of that will.
H.F.N. I would like to emphasise the importance of learning to follow things up. If we get a spiritual impression, though it may be a very simple one, we should follow it up. It is a great thing to get a divine impression of the wealth that is bound up in the ministry of Paul; and as we expand in that, it brings about a state in which the saints can understand and appreciate the truth of the rapture. We have spoken a little of the will of God, but then there is also the thought of *the calling* . The simplest impression of the calling is found in @Romans 8. We are said to be called "according to
{274}
purpose", and that involves that we should be conformed to the image of God's Son. It gives us a simple impression in regard to the calling, which is developed in Paul's ministry until we come to the full height of it in Ephesians. The apostle evidently would give the very best to these Thessalonian babes.
J.T.Jr. It is very important that we should stress the fact that we are not called to uncleanness. There is that which would attract the young people particularly, as the lust of the flesh and that kind of thing, which works havoc in our souls and keeps us in bondage.
H.F.N. Quite. And then we are called "in sanctification". It involves that the vessel is really set apart with a view to the holy service of God. How important it is to get an impression in regard to the will of God. If we are called in sanctification, there is a great deal of wealth opened up to us in relation to God's will. The Thessalonians had been brought out of a heathen world -- a scene of idolatry -- where there was the worst kind of uncleanness. I suppose there is always the danger of our going back to that from which we have been called, hence the great importance of understanding our being called in sanctification.
A.P. What is involved in the word *called*?
H.F.N. I suppose God would *appeal* to us, that in the carrying out of His purpose He has brought us into blessing. As called to anything we are to be governed by it.
R.W.S. Paul said he was not among them with flattery, or covetousness or seeking glory, but he had been gentle in the midst of them as a nurse would cherish her own children. They would never have found that in the heathen system. Was that not an inducement, as cradled in love, to judge these moral elements?
H.F.N. Well, indeed; I suppose a nurse is particularly concerned about three things: first, the atmosphere in which the child is to thrive; then the suitable
{275}
food it should be given; and the clothing it should wear. How the beloved apostle was concerned in regard to these three things, and the same spirit and desire should mark us.
J.S. What is involved in sanctification?
H.F.N. It is that we are really set apart as vessels for the will and service of God. It is a very wide subject, but the main thought is that we are set apart in relation to God's service and will. The apostle develops these great thoughts elsewhere. The next thought is *the gift of the Spirit* . It says in verse 8, "He therefore that in this disregards his brother, disregards, not man, but God, who has given also his Holy Spirit to you". This is an important statement in regard of this matter, and it would be of vital help to us all and particularly the younger brethren if we could get the thought of it in our souls.
If we get a divine impression of God's will, and then that we have been called, and then that God has given to us His Holy Spirit and what is bound up in that gift, it would be of immense gain.
J.T.Jr. So that the believer is set up here as having the Holy Spirit whereby he can use his vessel - himself really -- for the carrying out of God's will in his own affairs, on the one hand, and on the other hand, for the service and worship of God.
J.S. I suppose the Holy Spirit is seen here as on our side to maintain us in the will of God.
H.F.N. That is what I thought. Think of the possibilities that are opened up to us in the gift of the Holy Spirit! It has been truly said that we are often more infidel in regard to the presence of the Spirit than we are as to Christ. So that it is important that we raise the question. Are we making use of the Spirit -- are we in the present gain of His presence? He can say to these Thessalonian babes, "God ... has given ... his Holy Spirit to you".
{276}
A.P. Does the *making* use of the Holy Spirit make good in a practical way the sanctification of verse 7?
H.F.N. It does. The Lord will take out of this scene what pleases Him, and He is producing it at the present moment by the Spirit. He is producing holy vessels in this scene which have their part in relation to God's service and are here for His pleasure.
A.R. Does the service of the Spirit develop a state in us so that the Spirit and the bride say. Come?
H.F.N. That is the great end in view.
C.H.H. Would the Holy Spirit produce in us what was seen in Enoch and Noah; first, an inward consciousness of God's pleasure, and then an outward testimony in the power of the Spirit?
H.F.N. I am sure that is right.
A.B.P. Would you help us on the practical experience of making more room for the Spirit and how we can use the Spirit as power?
H.F.N. Well, the thing is illustrated in the woman in @2 Kings 4 who was to sell the oil that was poured out and then live on the rest. The vessels are to be full. "Set aside what is full"(@2 Kings 4:4) Elisha says.
A.R. Does the indwelling of the Holy Spirit develop a conscious relationship with the Lord Jesus and with the Father? It says, "no one can say. Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit", (@1 Corinthians 12:3), and by the Spirit we cry, Abba, Father.
H.F.N. Yes. What a joy it is to enter a holy realm, where, in the power of the Spirit, we say. Lord Jesus, and then to be able to look up and by the Spirit cry, Abba, Father. You can see therefore the profound import of this, "God, who has given also his Holy Spirit to you".
C.H.M. It brings out the holiness of God, does it not? I suppose that when the word "holy" is attached to the Spirit, it is to draw our attention to the need of holiness.
{277}
J.S. It would really be in keeping with the thought of sanctification. We cannot maintain our vessels in sanctification except by the Spirit.
A.P.T. Does not David say, "and take not the spirit of thy holiness from me", (@Psalm 51:11)? He felt the enormity of his sin in the presence of a holy God, did he not?
H.F.N. Indeed. So that, as having the Spirit, we should be exercised.
We have had the thought of God's will before us; that we are to be here for the will of God; and then we have considered the fact that we have been called; and then that God has given us His Holy Spirit, so that we should now see that we have been taught of God to love one another. Though young in the faith, these Thessalonian saints nevertheless had a flow of love amongst them, and it was a result of divine teaching. "For ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another", verse 9. It reminds us of the Lord's words in @John 13:35: "if ye have love amongst yourselves". Well now, in view of the imminence of the rapture, God would challenge every one of us as to whether we have love among ourselves. If we are not free in love among ourselves how can we really welcome the thought of the rapture? I believe the Lord has been adjusting the brethren all over the world. Questions have been faced which have been unsettled, some of them, for years. The Lord has brought to light these questions, and they have been faced in His presence, and it has brought in a remarkable spirit of love among the brethren. Well now, dear brethren, we want to have part in that. The word for us is that we have been taught of God to love one another; there is not a brother or a sister that is not to be an object of our love. We have been taught of God to love one another. This is in relation to the Christian circle, though there is the public side. The Lord is challenging the brethren all
{278}
over the world in regard to it. When you think of the ministry that the Lord has given to us -- the richest and choicest ministry -- well, what is the advantage of it to us if we have not love among ourselves? If there are any unsettled questions among us which are hindering that love, we should settle them at once.
J.S. We see in Cain the utter disregard of his brother. He says, "am I my brother's keeper?" (@Genesis 4:9).
C.A.M. The sphere of things into which we have been brought is where we love one another as taught of God. It is really a realm where there is no self-interest.
H.F.N. I am sure that is right. This was not written for the Thessalonians only. With all the light we profess, and the ministry we have received, it is a challenge to each one of us. "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves", (@John 13:35). As has been suggested, there is that which would come out publicly in testimony as a result. The Lord says in @John 13:17, "If ye know these things, blessed are ye if ye do them",.
J.T.Jr. Disregarding God, as suggested in verse 8 of our chapter, would be tantamount to disregarding His will or commandment, would it not?
H.F.N. Quite.
A.B.P. Loving one another would suggest a horizontal flow. Being "taught of God to love one another" is seen in Christ in @John 13. He was teaching His own, and as the antitype of the Hebrew servant. He said, "I love ... my wife, and my children (@Exodus 21:5)". The Lord calls them children in @John 13:33.
H.F.N. It would indeed; and in the apostle, too, who had been the embodiment of love as moving amongst the Thessalonians. They had been taught by example.
A.R. The Lord, in quoting from Deuteronomy says, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God ..." (@Matthew 22:37) and then He says, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself (@Matthew 19:19).
{279}
On these two commandments the whole law and the prophets hang", @Matthew 22:37 - 40. The apostle, in writing to the Galatians, says, "The whole law is fulfilled in one word, in Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself", @Galatians 5:14.
C.H.M. Why does "seek earnestly to be quiet and mind your own affairs", verse 11, come in in relation to loving one another? Do many of our troubles come about through taking up things which do not concern us?
H.F.N. I am sure that is right. It is not every one of us that carries it out. No doubt many of our troubles result from interfering with what is outside our range. If we were more occupied in caring for the interests of Christ and minding our own affairs, there would be fewer heartaches amongst the brethren, and these matters are touched on here as indicating how the Lord prepares us in view of our suitability for the rapture. We are all to be taught of God; that there may be a full flow of love amongst the brethren. There should not be a brother or a sister in the meeting into whose face one cannot look; and we should be able, as the apostle said, to "Salute one another with a holy kiss", (@2 Corinthians 13:12). It would be a challenge to us, in view of the imminence of the rapture; for whilst we know that the moment has been set in the counsels of God, when the rapture will take place, and no man knows that day or hour, yet we may be hindered as to the present enjoyment of the hope by unsettled questions amongst us.
W.R. Reference is made in this epistle as well as in Corinthians to greeting one another with a holy kiss.
H.F.N. We should challenge our hearts as to whether there is a brother or a sister whom we cannot salute thus. The apostle, in speaking of the rapture, has in mind that the saints should be morally prepared for it. He is concerned that there should be developed that
{280}
which is pleasing to the Lord, so that He delights to take it to heaven.
J.T.Jr. This challenge comes to us in a special way at the supper each Lord's day morning. The bread and the cup challenge us as to whether everything has been settled between us; that we are ready to go up.
W.R. In keeping with what has been said, the apostle says further, "Now the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly: and your whole spirit, and soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ", (@1 Thessalonians 5:23).
R.W.S. What is companionable is translatable! Enoch walked with God three hundred years; there was companionship between him and God, and he was translated.
H.F.N. Very good; and that is what we would desire, and so the apostle now passes on to the thought of the rapture: "But we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them that are fallen asleep, to the end that ye be not grieved even as also the rest who have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus has died and has risen again, so also God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep through Jesus", chapter 4: 13,14. Our attention has often been called to the fact that some of the Thessalonians had been taken away by death, and those who remained were troubled because they thought the sleeping ones would miss the coming of the Lord. The word would comfort and instruct their hearts, for he first deals with those who have fallen asleep through Jesus. Think of the vast number of saints who have fallen asleep through Jesus! It is also said of them that they have died *in Christ* , they have died *in faith* and many of them are said to have died *in the Lord* , but here, it is said that they have *fallen asleep* through Jesus. What a source of comfort it is to think that those who have been taken from us have fallen asleep through Jesus! He has served them as they fell asleep.
{281}
A.F.M. They will have the first attention.
H.F.N. Yes; one cherishes the thought that the rapture will be for the pleasure of God and for the heart of Christ, yet, of course, we come into it, and those who sleep will have the first attention.
A.P. What is the difference between the thought of falling asleep and of dying?
H.F.N. We have the expression in @Revelation 14:13, "Blessed the dead who die in the Lord",. That is of course a military reference to those who die in relation to the testimony. Every Christian who has passed away can be said to have died in Christ, but it is not every one who dies in the Lord.
A.R. Would you explain the end of verse 14: "so also God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep through Jesus"?
H.F.N. What follows is the explanation. The parenthesis in verses 15 - 18 contains a special revelation of the Lord to Paul in regard to the rapture and it explains how God is to bring these saints who have fallen asleep through Jesus with Jesus. The truth of the rapture is brought in to comfort the hearts of those saints in regard to their departed brethren.
R.W.S. Will you say more as to what you have in mind about dying in the Lord, in Christ, and falling asleep through Jesus?
H.F.N. I think *dying in Christ* stands in relation to headship and in contrast to what we are in Adam; we die *in Christ* . Dying *in the Lord* suggests a victorious death upon the battlefield; we die in relation to the testimony. Then also, we are said to die *in faith* . Faith is divine light in the soul; we die with the light of another world in our hearts. And then we get this beautiful thought of falling asleep through Jesus. He puts us to sleep, as it were. It is like a child falling asleep in its parent's arms.
J.T.Jr. The thought "through Jesus" suggests
{282}
instrumentality. It is the One who had to say to death, who performs this service to His saints.
H.F.N. Yes. Our chapter is really moral education in view of translation, and the apostle brings revelation to bear upon it; "For this we say to you in the word of the Lord, that *we* , the living, who remain to the coming of the Lord, are in no way to anticipate those who have fallen asleep", verse 15, and then he says later, "the dead in Christ shall rise first", verse 16. Well, we know from @1 Corinthians 15 that those who have died in Christ from Adam down will be raised incorruptible, as a witness to the power of God over death. Think of the myriads of the saints who will have part in that testimony, as it says, "then shall come to pass the word ... Death has been swallowed up in victory", (@1 Corinthians 15:54). And now we have this special revelation in regard to the rapture. The living are not to go before those who have fallen asleep, but, "the Lord himself, with an assembling shout, with archangel's voice and with trump of God, shall descend from heaven; and the dead in Christ shall rise first; then *we* , the living who remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air", verse 16, 17.
J.S. These verses which you have quoted give us the manner, or order, by which the thing will be brought about.
H.F.N. Exactly.
A.R. What would you say about the words used, "the Lord himself ... shall descend"? Why does it say *"the Lord*"?
H.F.N. There are different uses of the title "Lord", but I think here. He is presented as the supreme One; administration is in His hands. "The Lord himself ... shall descend". It is a question of the exercise of His power.
W.F.K. Would the shout be the same as the loud voice that called Lazarus from the grave?
{283}
H.F.N. It is the same voice.
J.S. Would the assembling shout have a military aspect; that is, it gathers all together?
H.F.N. Indeed; it reminds us of the passage in the book of Numbers where the priests sounded the silver trumpets, and the people were gathered together; and then, too, the Lord's supper really becomes the rallying point for the saints, but the last move on the part of the saints is when we respond to this assembling shout.
C.H.M. I suppose there is the idea of victory in the assembling shout. We do not read of any great stir on earth in connection with the rapture, but it will hardly be private in heaven, for Satan will be cast out of heaven.
H.F.N. Would you not connect that with the catching up of the Man-child? The moment Christ and the saints have entered into the heavenlies, then Satan is publicly cast out; but the rapture as such is secret. The assembling shout gives it character, as connecting it with the passage in Numbers. We have been accustomed to the sound of the trumpet in relation to the movements of the testimony, and its final movement will be when the assembly leaves this scene. That is the last time the silver trumpet will be heard. And so, we have the assembling shout, archangel voice, and trump of God; that is, the *character* of the voice, a voice of *power* and *victory* , and then the divine assertion of *authority* .
W.F.K. Would the word in @Revelation 4:1 come in here? -- "the ... voice which I heard as of a trumpet speaking with me, saying. Come up here",.
H.F.N. It is similar in character.
A.R. If we are going to respond to the supreme call of the rights of God in the rapture, should we not, in the meantime, be concerned about yielding to God's rights over us on earth?
H.F.N. Yes. The three things take place concurrently; it is the assembling shout, which is the
{284}
intimate thought; then archangel's voice, which I thought really brings out that the Lord is Head of the angelic band. He is not only Head of the assembly, and Head of every man, but He is Head of the angelic band; so that it is the voice of power; and then the trump of God is the assertion of divine authority over the whole realm of the dead. The scripture is clear, "for the Lord himself, ... shall descend from heaven; and the dead in Christ shall rise first; then *we* , the living who remain, shall, be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air", verse 17. Emphasis is on the word "together". He has spoken of those who have fallen asleep through Jesus, and then he refers to the living who remain, who shall not anticipate the sleeping ones, for we shall all be caught up *together* ; we shall all meet Him together. One feels that the Lord is stirring up His people so that the hope of His coming may be revived in their affections, and that we might view it from the standpoint of what God will secure for His pleasure, and what there will be for the heart of Christ. If that were to take place tonight, what joy and ecstatic bliss would be ours in seeing the face of the Lord Jesus. It should challenge us if there is anything on our part that is hindering this.
J.T.Jr. It is a great thing to be able, every one of us, to put ourselves in the "we" as we face this great prospect.
H.F.N. One would like to guard against the teaching abroad today in regard to a partial rapture, which, we need hardly say, is foreign to scripture. The Lord is not to take half His bride. When the Lord comes for His assembly, He will take the whole company. As a simple illustration, a magnet, when applied to steel particles will draw them all to it, even though some may be rusty and others bright. That, of course, is His side, but on our side, we should face the question as to whether,
{285}
if the Lord should come tonight, we are really prepared for translation.
J.S. All difficulties should be settled; all that stands in the way should be removed.
A.P.T. You mean we should get rid of the rust.
H.F.N. Exactly.
{286}
THE LORD'S COMING (2)
@1 Thessalonians 1:10; @1 Thessalonians 2:17 - 20; @1 Thessalonians 3:12,13; @1 Thessalonians 5:1 - 11,23
J.T. In suggesting this book one has in mind that the subject before us should be pursued in a constructive way; we should begin where the Spirit of God begins, that is, in the Thessalonian epistle. It was Paul's initial epistle. We learn from the apostles, initially, especially from Paul. Then the gospels may be used to enlarge our subject. Thirdly, the Old Testament scriptures will yield, amplifying the truth as we proceed. Enoch was referred to at the previous reading, on chapter 4 of this book, and the Lord's coming is connected with other leading men in the Old Testament. But the first letter to the Thessalonians is used by the Spirit of God to introduce this subject in a variety of ways. The Thessalonians were young Christians - just converted. The letter was written shortly after the apostle left Thessalonica, and he introduced the subject of the Lord's coming in every chapter, which is very significant. He touches on it again in the second epistle. It would seem that the Lord would help the young, with all of us, to consider the subject in the order in which the Spirit of God has presented it. In this epistle it is mainly connected with the *state* of the saints. The first reference to it is in relation to the Son of God. The saints were waiting for the Son of God from heaven, which is very suggestive, as presenting Christ in His peculiar attractiveness in relation to another world. Secondly, in chapter 2, the apostle brings himself into the matter in a touching way, regarding the saints as his "crown of boasting" at the coming of our Lord Jesus. In chapter 3 we have love among the brethren connected with the coming of the Lord Jesus: "to the confirming of your hearts unblamable in holiness
{287}
before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints". Then, in chapter 4, the coming of the Lord *for* His saints. In chapter 5, what we are in a public way, as "sons of light", is connected with His coming. So that an instructive variety of features of the subject is seen in this book as bearing on our state; beginning, as we have noted, with our attitude as waiting for God's Son from heaven.
A.B.P. You mentioned the attractiveness of the Son of God in connection with another world. Will you say what you had in mind in that connection?
J.T. The Son of God is mentioned in many connections in scripture, but here He seems to be presented in an attractive way; that is, the thought is *attractive* . It was the outcome of the gospel which was preached to them. Romans presents the gospel as concerning God's Son; it says, "marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead (@Romans 1:4)". The epistle to the Romans presents Christ as the Son of God in this most interesting way. It would seem as if that title is intended to attract us in the gospel. Paul says, "But when God ... was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations", (@Galatians 1:15,16). It would seem that He is presented as an Object for our hearts; to be waited for from heaven.
A.R.S. I suppose that looking for the Son of God from heaven would keep our affections fresh for Christ, and would result in separation from everything contrary to Him.
J.T. Yes; and it suggests what He is to God as Son: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight", (@Matthew 3:17). God presents Him to us that He may be our delight. He has gone into heaven, but He is coming back and we await Him "from the heavens".
A.B.P. Is His attractiveness exemplified in John 9?
J.T. Just so. "Dost thou believe on the Son of God? (@John 9:35)"
{288}
The Lord would fix his heart. And what follows, right through to the early part of chapter 12, is that the Son of God might be glorified; He is glorified as our hearts are drawn to Him, and we are waiting for Him. There seems to be a fixedness in mind for our affections; a fixedness answering to the presentation of Christ as the Son. We have been helped in regard to this title, and it surely is that we might be drawn to Him, out of this world, to where He is.
C.A.M. Would you say that the way Paul mentioned the Son of God in Damascus at the outset would show that from the beginning he had this wonderful truth of the Person of Christ before him to fill out?
J.T. It shines out in his ministry in a peculiar way. There is a peculiar attractiveness in God presenting His Son to the affections of man; that man might be drawn to Him, and thus be drawn out of this world into the world in which He is. The Son of God involves another world.
J.S. Would it involve complete deliverance from this world?
J.T. That is what is in mind. Deliverance from this world involves another world being opened up to you. That is what is meant in @John 9. The man was cast out of the religious world, and the Lord would fix his thoughts on another world. This is deliverance. If he had nothing of a peculiar nature to hold him after he had been cast out, he might drift back again. As we go forth unto Him, sonship in Christ holds us as in another state of things.
C.N. The interview that Nathanael had with the Lord Jesus resulted in his saying, "thou art the Son of God (@John 1:49)". Does that help in illustrating attractiveness?
J.T. That is a good scripture to bring in here. It underlies what has been said. Many young people professedly take an outside place, but what is to hold them? Light will not always suffice. The heart must be
{289}
brought into the position; there must be an Object to hold you outside, so that you do not go back. Nathanael came out. "Come and see", Philip said to him. The Lord saw to it that as he came there was something to hold him, so that he came to the light of the Son of God.
P.R. Do you think that the entering in of the apostle and the two servants with him, as mentioned in verse 9, would express sonship? They would see it in the apostle and those with him.
J.T. Yes. In the epistle to the Corinthians the apostle alludes to himself and those two brothers; "For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, he who has been preached by us among you (by me and Silvanus and Timotheus), did not become yea and nay, but yea *is* in him", @2 Corinthians 1:19. These three were engaged in the presentation of the Son of God, and the consequence is that the Thessalonians turned to God from idols and were awaiting the Son of God from heaven. Paul had been preaching in Thessalonica, but he also "went in among them (@Acts 17:2)". He would be among them as a brother as well as an apostle, and evidently these two servants were with him, so that there must have been a very real presentation of Christianity as it is in Christ in this threefold testimony. Those two brothers, Silvanus and Timotheus, were linked up with Paul in preaching the Son of God at Corinth and doubtless also in Thessalonica.
A.R. In that sense there was more than light there.
J.T. You could not help but see the radiation of affection in those three brothers as they presented the Son of God, for it would be in a very attractive way; because it is not only the truth presented in the gospel that makes it attractive, but the person that presents it.
A.N.W. And all their ministry would concentrate upon one God, and His Son, in contradistinction to the multiplicity of idols from which they had turned.
J.T. Yes; for it says: "and how ye turned to God
{290}
from idols to serve a living and true God, and to await his Son from the heavens", (@1 Thessalonians 9,10). There must have been a very beautiful testimony presented in a threefold way to attain such a result in such a short time.
J.S. So that you see them completely delivered from idolatry, and serving a living and true God. They seem to have received a good start.
J.T. That is what I thought; the acceptance of a living and true God, and His Son.
A.R. So that we are not waiting for release from the world merely, but for the Son coming into His rights. These scriptures refer to His coming in a public way, do they not?
J.T. That is the truth. His coming for us is enlarged in chapter 4. That will be to take us out of this world. But the general thought of His coming is that He is coming in again to take charge here below. That is what they were waiting for.
A.R. I was wondering if it corresponds to Hushai, Zadok and Abiathar remaining in Jerusalem with the ark while David was in rejection.
J.T. They would be waiting for David to come back.
A.N.W. In that connection, should we have more definitely before us the display of the coming rather than the transference in the rapture?
J.T. Oh, yes. The transference in the rapture is very little spoken of -- chiefly in this epistle. The general thought is that the Son of God is coming back from the heavens. "The heavens" is added here.
J.S. Is the rapture but an incident in the coming?
J.T. That is the way the truth is presented. We are taken up for a little while and then we come out with Him; the rapture is a private matter. Generally speaking, the coming of Christ is spoken of as a great public matter; sometimes called His appearing.
A.P.T. The six verses which begin with verse 5
{291}
commence with the thought of the glad tidings. They comprise one sentence ending with the thought of the Lord's coming. Is it connected with the preaching?
J.T. Yes. There is a great richness in chapter 1, especially as indicating quick development in the Thessalonians in the Christian state and testimony growing out of it, and happy relations between them and the apostle. The connection here is the glad tidings, because the glad tidings are concerning God's Son. The word would be presented in an attractive way, as at Corinth later. That is the great thought at this time, that the Lord might be apprehended by us as the Son of God, so that our affections may be freshly set; we are to be looking for Him from heaven. He is our Deliverer from the coming wrath. We shall be immune from wrath. He has effected our deliverance from it.
J.T.Jr. When you spoke of state did you have in mind the result of the gospel in that the Spirit of God's Son comes into our hearts, leading up to service to the Father, and then the waiting on our side in an intelligent way for the Son?
J.T. That is the thought. The way the epistle begins is striking: "Paul ... to the assembly of Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ @1 Thessalonians 1:1". This would imply that they were very lovable believers. It is a very remarkable title to attach to them; "the assembly of Thessalonians in God the Father (@1 Thessalonians 1:1)". Their *local* setting is stressed, and nevertheless they are "in God the Father" the "in" being positional, but referring to the place they had in God's affections. They were so lovable, and hence would enhance the richness of Paul's ministry for the three sabbaths in that town. God effected such results; such attractive persons. For it is not simply that they were saints, but they were Thessalonians. They are viewed peculiarly as local to the place, and yet they are "in God the Father".
{292}
W.R. So that the testimony had spread to Thessalonica. "For *ye* , brethren, have become imitators of the assemblies of God which are in Judaea in Christ Jesus", (@1 Thessalonians 2:14). It is extensive to that point.
J.T. That is it. They were attractive to God the Father; they were in the Father. It is the very preposition that the Lord Himself uses: "In that day ye shall know that *I* am in my Father (@John 14:20)". It alludes to the Father's affection. These saints were loved by Him; His Son was in their hearts. They were awaiting Him. That would *keep* them out of this world, as they had come out.
J.S. Are they viewed positionally here in a two-fold sense, "in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ"(@1 Thessalonians 1:1)?
J.T. It is a question of the affections of the Father for the Thessalonians. They were so lovable! The apostle speaks touchingly to them in the end of chapter 2; they had a striking place in *his* heart; it all brings out what a work was effected in that city in a short time.
A.N.W. They are addressed similarly in the second letter.
J.T. Showing they were not losing ground. The apostle's affections are expressed at length in chapter 2, but peculiarly in the verses we have read. He says, "But we, brethren, having been bereaved of you and separated for a little moment in person, not in heart, have used more abundant diligence to see your face with much desire; wherefore we have desired to come to you, even I Paul, both once and twice, and Satan has hindered us. For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of boasting? are not ye also before our Lord Jesus at his coming? for ye are our glory and joy", verse 17 - 20. It seems to me that this statement of Paul's should be linked up with the position of the Thessalonians in chapter 1 -- "in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ"(@1 Thessalonians 1:1). It is a question of their attractiveness, and of course that ought to search us as to whether *we* are in
{293}
any way attractive, because the result of the gospel should lead to something for God's heart and Christ's heart and for the heart of the servants whom God uses to help us, whether it be our conversion or later service.
A.B.P. In Acts it says they preached Jesus and the resurrection. According to this scripture, it would be proper to include the Lord's coming in the preaching.
J.T. Quite so. You might be sure Paul added it constantly. Indeed, the dispensation began with that same thought. "This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall thus come in the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven", (@Acts 1: 11). That is how the dispensation began.
A.R. Would the preaching of Christ as the Son of God be with a view to developing sonship in the saints?
J.T. Yes; first to afford an Object for our affections; One who is attractive, but at the same time powerful. That is how Paul presents the truth. It is the glad tidings concerning God's Son, "marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead -- Jesus Christ our Lord", (@Romans 1:4). That is not exactly His own resurrection, but the resurrection of the dead; it is plural. He is attractive, but with power! So that you have One who is able to hold us, and He is our Deliverer from the coming wrath. And then, as we were saying, the end of chapter 2 shows how Paul regarded them; they were his joy and crown. He later speaks much of Corinth; "written in our hearts", @2 Corinthians 3:2, They were, through him, "known and read of all men". He would speak freely of them in a commendatory way.
J.T.Jr. He seems to regard them as one. He says, "your face"; it is in the singular.
J.T. Yes; "we ... have used more abundant diligence to see your face with much desire", verse 17. That is a form of words to indicate they are all linked together; many in one thought. One has lately been
{294}
impressed with how we ought to look at the brethren. They should become increasingly attractive; you serve them in love; you are thinking of them thus in your service. That is how Paul looked at the Thessalonians.
C.A.M. It works both ways. If the saints are a reflex of the ministry, we would do well to come under the light of the most glorious ministry available. As you say, there is a wonderful reflex in these saints to his ministry.
J.T. That is right. The cumulative thought in this epistle includes the servants. The next cumulative thought is the servant through whom they have been converted; the Thessalonians will be Paul's crown of boasting at the Lord's coming. The saints are to the servants what they are to Christ, and here they are to be Paul's crown. That is to say, he can point to them as the fruit of his work.
J.S. He was very greatly compensated for this remarkable service.
J.T. And that ought to induce admiration of, and, consequently, love for, the brethren. Of course, sometimes they are unlovely, but any work of God is surely to be admired. It is most important to learn to take account of the saints in relation to the work of God in them. In certain circumstances all else can be left. This is essential to the service of God in the assembly.
A.N.W. Why should Satan want to hinder the meeting of Paul and the saints?
J.T. That brings out the whole position, really. It is a love question. It implies the fruitfulness of this fresh work of God, and Satan would rob God and Christ, and Paul too, of this loveliness of the Thessalonians.
P.R. Would the words, "before our Lord Jesus", emphasise what you are saying? They would be able to stand the light and scrutiny of that moment and appear in their beauty there.
{295}
J.T. That is what I thought. There is a group of things suggested; they are waiting for Christ, but they are glorious now! Paul is regarding them as before our Lord Jesus Christ; they are his crown: "what is our hope, or joy, or crown of boasting? are not *ye* also before our Lord Jesus at his coming? for ye are our glory and joy". All that will stand the test of the presence of the Lord when He comes.
W.R. Would this fit in with the song in @Exodus 15? I thought that as new converts they make much of the Father and the Son, and the language of the song in @Exodus 15 was the result of deliverance which had so recently taken place. They say, "This is my God, and I will glorify him", (@Exodus 15:2).
J.T. Quite so; they were taken up with Jehovah. He had acquired a place in their hearts. They believed, God and His servant Moses. They were engaged with Jehovah and were able to sing that song with Moses.
J.T.Jr. Would you say the apostle had confidence in the local company even though he was not there in person? He said he was separated from them in person, but not in heart.
J.T. One of the features of the apostle Paul was that he could link up with the brethren, as present, even though absent physically. He said to the Corinthians, "as absent in body but present in spirit", @1 Corinthians 5:3,4, And "ye and my spirit being gathered together",. What underlies all that is the organism of which we are a part; that is, the assembly; so that the apostle was enabled, by the Spirit's power, to link on, in spirit, with the saints at a distance.
A.N.W. One would like to know more of the feeling of bereavement as departing from one another -- "having been bereaved of you" -- a very touching word!
J.T. One is tested like that. One sees a good many of the brethren and must say good-bye frequently, and it is a real test. One often prays that it might be done
{296}
properly, not in a mere perfunctory way; leaving the saints in affection; saying good-bye as of the divine family. I think the apostle Paul leads in family affection.
A.P.T. Mr. Darby gives a foot-note to the word "separated" in verse 17 -- he renders it "orphaned of".
J.T. Yes; that is he had a sense as to them of being Orphaned -- a striking word. The Lord says, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you", (@John 14:18). That is what the apostle had in mind to do. He was so linked up in affection with the Thessalonians.
A.B.P. He had nursed them as a mother, and as a father had taught them how to walk, having full manhood in view at the coming of the Lord. Is that right?
J.T. Quite so; and with the skill of a nurse, "as a nurse would cherish her own children", (@1 Thessalonians 2:7). So that they would not be malformed; they would not be allowed to fall and become lame, like Mephibosheth. It was true love underlying all this, to do the best for the brethren.
A.R. Does it not suggest that the servant carries the saints in his affections, and the saints, in turn, carry the servant in their affections?
J.T. Yes. This particular part of the epistle shows the link between the servant and the saints, in view of the Lord's coming; they are seen as "before him" then. That is one of the cumulative features -- how the saints will appear in relation to the ministers through whom they have been helped -- hence John says, "that we ... may receive full wages", @2 John 8. What would the full wages be, save what we get here; what the heart cherishes in the saints? Paul says, "For what is our ... crown ... are not *ye* also ... ?" I believe the wages, alluded to by John, are similar to this; it is one of the cumulative ideas that will be present at the coming of the Lord Jesus; not the way they served the saints, but the way they loved them, all being lovable. The work of each
{297}
servant will be manifest. The Lord will know how to express all that in a crown.
W.B-w. There is a reference in @John 4:36, "He that reaps receives wages",.
J.T. The thought is developed in his second epistle. He says, "that we may not lose what we have wrought, but may receive full wages", @2 John 8. As converted, by the grace of God, when the Lord Jesus comes, you will be there, and you will want the person He has used for your blessing to be there, that you may shine as his crown.
C.N. Does not verse 8 of chapter 2 support all that has been said? "Thus, yearning over you, we had found our delight in having imparted to you not only the glad tidings of God, but our own lives also, because ye had become beloved of us (@1 Thessalonians 2:8)".
J.T. Very beautiful! "Because ye had become" - it was a development as he was there amongst them. One would like to see and find in oneself a little of this rapidity of development, for it was only a matter of three weeks in the case of the Thessalonians.
Now the next thought is that we are to be before our God and Father, as in chapter 3:13. The Thessalonians are to be "in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints". It will be a wonderful throng -- a wonderful variety of the work of God, and the bearing of it all according to this passage is that we are before our God and Father in holiness; hence the service of God enters into our subject in chapter 3.
J.S. It is a remarkable expression -- "unblamable in holiness".
J.T. I thought that; and it is "before our God and Father" in the cumulative position here, because the thing is expanding; it is "all his saints". The Thessalonians are to be there, and the apostle's love is towards them. He says in verse 12, "But you, may the Lord make to exceed and abound in love toward one
{298}
another, and toward all, even as we also towards you, in order to the confirming of your hearts unblamable in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints". It seems to me that this has its bearing Godward. It is what we are for God, in holiness; how it is worked out and how it will appear at the Lord's coming. It is a question of love.
J.S. Does it relate to the whole sojourn here?
J.T. Well, this is the end of the sojourn; how we appear when the Lord comes with all His saints. What an immense display there will be! We want to know how to be there; it is a question of what is for God now, and the development is that we "exceed and abound in love toward one another, and toward all", and as it was displayed in Paul too, "in order to the confirming of your hearts unblamable in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints". It seems to me this is the great end; it is a question of what is for God at the end.
A.N.W. Is it further inward? The crown is not in view now, so much as a place of dwelling.
J.T. I think that is right; it is inward; it is bearing on eternity, that we are before our God and Father, dwelling unblamable in holiness.
F.H.L. Would the first chapter of 1 John lead up to this? I was thinking of the fellowship of the Father and the conditions which must obtain for the practical pathway suitable for it -- God being light.
J.T. Well, that would work out in connection with what the apostle begins with -- what was from the beginning, and how he has seen and heard and handled "concerning the word of life, (@1 John 1:1)" and he wrote that the saints might "have fellowship with us";(@1 John 1:3) that is, with the apostles; their fellowship was with the Father and with the Son. So that the saints are brought into the fellowship of the apostles. It would certainly bear upon what we have before us here, only here it is the final
{299}
thought -- "before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints".
C.A.M. So that it would be an advance on what was remarked as to service. In the first chapter it says, "how ye turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God (@1 Thessalonians 1:9)". The footnote says, 'to serve as bondmen'. I suppose there is a service flowing from deliverance from the outside world, but there is this beautiful inside service, would you say?
J.T. Quite so; the culmination of what the apostle has in mind would be that they are before our God and Father at the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints; that they would not be behind the great general position, because all the work through the apostles, and servants generally, is to conform us to the divine counsels. Everything must fit with the divine counsels, and the apostle introduces great thoughts here, one after another. And this, then, it is "with all the saints". How do we measure up with them? You move amongst the saints in New York, or London, or Melbourne, or Sydney, or other places, and you see that there are gradations, of course, but they are all the subject of the work of God, and you do not want to be behind them. Paul has the highest idea here -- "unblamable in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints". You want to learn to measure up in the general display before God.
J.T.Jr. Would it be seen from the divine side in @Ephesians 1:4? In our chapter it is rather that there is something going on in the saints, leading up to the thought of holiness.
J.T. That is it exactly; "love toward one another, and toward all". The latter is the general thought, like Colossians. And then Paul says, "as we also towards you". He had indeed shown them the way, and all with a view to their hearts being confirmed unblamable
{300}
in holiness before our God. So that, I think, the instruction the Lord is giving us as to service now would help on those lines, but light is not enough. It is a matter of love toward one another locally; and then toward all -- that would be universal -- according to the example Paul had set.
A.N.W. Service Godward is in mind here.
J.T. Yes.
F.S.C. Would this be the practical working out of the peace offering?
J.T. Well, the peace offering is love toward one another, but it is also that in which God has part, which is an important matter. Can God have part with us in these meetings? Well, if He has part with us, this work will be going on -- love toward one another, and love toward all, but then there is the holiness, because without holiness we cannot see the Lord; we cannot be to God's pleasure save with holiness. So that the peace offering is a question of felicitation; but God being there, there must be holiness. What is before us is in view of the future -- the coming of the Lord.
A.R. What have you in mind in regard to service?
J.T. Well, "holiness before our God and Father" refers here to our eternal service before Him. We are pleasing to Him. Leviticus is the working out of it at the present time, in type, of course, but *"we* are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God", (@Philippians 3:3). The word 'worship' has the meaning of 'service' and is more public. We come to that in holiness, but it is a question of development here; it is love toward one another, which is a local condition; and then the universal condition -- love toward all, including those at a distance. God can love at a distance, and He would have us do so.
E.E.H. How does that thought synchronise with @Colossians 1, where we have the idea of the presentation before the Godhead.
{301}
J.T. Well, it is a similar wording, "by him to reconcile all things to itself, having made peace by the blood of his cross ... to present you holy and unblamable and irreproachable before it", (@Colossians 1:20,22). It is almost the same wording, only the "fulness" is spoken of in the neuter, being referred to as "it". It is God, of course, as in chapter 2:9. It is the Deity. We are presented before it.
W.B-w. And Jude refers to it, too, "to set you with exultation blameless before his glory", @Jude 24. Every servant has that in mind, has he not?
J.T. It keeps one right in his service; not simply that he has done a good piece of work, but the thought of the result for God should dominate all things with us.
A.R. One would have God the Father before him, but is it also your thought that we cannot leave the saints out of our minds? Love, working in relation to assembly service, must have the saints in mind.
J.T. Exactly; hence the Lord says, "If therefore thou shouldest offer thy gift at the altar, and there shouldest remember that thy brother has something against thee, leave there thy gift before the altar, and first go, be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift", (@Matthew 5:23,24), because you must, as it were, bring *him* . And so here it is love toward one another, and love toward all; that is, when I draw near to God, I do so in relation to all the saints. Colossians teaches love towards all saints. Ephesians teaches us that God has raised us up together and made us sit down together in the heavenlies; that is, *all* the saints are included, and if you love them, you would not wish to go without them.
W.B-w. But "unblamable" must apply to us now, as before God in assembly service.
J.T. That is right, in the abstract thought of it; the Spirit enables you to take that ground, as associated
{302}
with Christ. "He that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one", (@Hebrews 2:11).
N.P. In @Hebrews 12, the writer, referring to chastening, says that it is that we might be partakers of His holiness.
J.T. Well, quite so; He is the Father of spirits, and disciplines us that we might be partakers of His holiness, not merely of holiness, but *His* holiness. So that He would have us entirely suitable to Himself.
And then, passing over chapter 4, which has been considered previously, and which refers to the rapture -- a most important part of the epistle -- we come to chapter 5, where the question of times comes into view. "But concerning the time and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that ye should be written to, for ye know perfectly well yourselves, that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief by night", verse 1, 2. This question of time often comes up. When the disciples asked the Lord about it. He says, "It is not yours to know times or seasons, which the Father has placed in his own authority", (@Acts 1:7) -- a very important matter to keep before us. Who can say anything of the date of the coming of the Lord? Daniel was concerned about his city and his people, but as to the coming of the Lord, who can say? The Lord says, "It is not yours to know times or seasons, which the Father has placed in his own authority (@Acts 1:7)". We are to bow to that. He says that not even the Son knows, but the Father. That helps, I think, as to the economy in which we are; that God is reserving His own place in it and intimates to us that this is so. He is not obliged to tell us everything; we are to be reverent and subject as regards that, and not to be too sure as to dates indicated in public events and time already elapsed. The apostle, however, does not say here. It is not yours to know, but rather, "ye have no need that ye should be written to, for ye know perfectly well yourselves, that the day of the Lord so
{303}
comes as a thief by night". He does not say *what* night. We are kept on the *qui vive*; we cannot say just how far off it is. We have the Lord's own word that He comes quickly, but that means when the time arrives. But He said that He Himself does not know; the Lord Himself has graciously taken that attitude, @Mark 13:32.
E.E.H. What does "the day of the Lord" refer to in chapter 5:2. What event is in mind?
J.T. It is when He comes out; we have reference made to the day of the Lord, the day of God, and the day of Christ, Christ's day. This, I think, is the authoritative day, somewhat linked with the word in Revelation, by John: "I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day", @Revelation 1:10. It is a question of authority, and the whole context shows that, for He comes as a thief, and He comes in judgment; it is the side of judgment.
J.S. In that day He will brook no evil.
J.T. Well, He comes out armed with all that is necessary to deal with His enemies, so that we have in the next book, "whom the Lord Jesus shall consume with the breath of his mouth, and shall annul by the appearing of his coming;" @2 Thessalonians 2:8.
W.B-w. He says the same thing to Sardis -- "I will come upon thee as a thief", (@Revelation 3:3). Does that refer to this day?
J.T. That is a judicial reference to the state of Sardis, which is not the case here. But he is reminding the saints what they knew already, that the Lord would come as a thief. But He is not telling them *when*, so that we are kept watching; hence he says, "But *ye* , brethren, are not in darkness, that the day should overtake you as a thief". He could not say that to Sardis. There is nothing blameworthy here; it is a question of the economy; that is, the Father keeps things in His power; we do not know the day, but the apostle stresses that the way the Lord comes, will be
{304}
as a thief. That refers to the apostate Christendom. It will not be the bearing of it to those who are expecting Him. Therefore, he says, "*But ye* , brethren, are not in darkness, that the day should overtake you as a thief: for *all ye* are sons of light and sons of day; we are not of night nor of darkness. So then do not let us sleep as the rest do, but let us watch and be sober; for they that sleep sleep by night, and they that drink drink by night; but *we* being of the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and as helmet the hope of salvation", verses 4 - 8. It seems to me that this is an important side to our subject as bearing on our conduct publicly.
J.S. As sons of light, we should be in constant expectation; we are not of the night, or as those who sleep.
J.T. I think the idea is that the light of another day has come upon us. Peter says, "until the day dawn and the morning star arise in your hearts", @2 Peter 1:19. But Paul brings us into it; we are already in it, and sons -- not children, but sons -- meaning we are developed in the thought, and hence our conduct is to be according to this -- luminous -- and therefore we walk soberly.
W.R. Would you say the disciples came to this, following the Lord's ascension, as presented in @Acts 1? When they came into the city they went into the upper chamber.
J.T. They knew what to do; it implied that they did not belong to the religious world; they belonged to the new order of things. Sons of light know what to do.
R.S. Is it what the Lord speaks of in the end of @Mark 13, in regard to the day, and our attitude of watching and praying?
J.T. That is the same thought exactly. Yes, indeed.
A.B.P. We speak of the first day of the week as the Lord's day, and we have God before us in a special way on that day. Should this experience keep us in
{305}
full accord, now, with this day of the Lord of which the apostle speaks?
J.T. I think that is right. We acquire sensibilities as in assembly which tend to guide the mind as to the Lord's coming. As our sensibilities are developed in the assembly, we get instinctively to know He is near, there is no doubt about it with us as a general expectation. You can gather up from inside conditions that He is near. There are waiting voices -- the Spirit and the bride say. Come. There is something going on all the time in what is current and we get it by instinct. Such do not pretend to know the date of His coming. That makes the great difference, I think, between those who are spiritual and subject, and those who study prophecy, and try to work out public events as corresponding. They do not get very far; it is the person in the assembly in a characteristic sense acquiring instinctive feelings from the Lord, who has reliable discernment as to this great and blessed matter.
Ques. How do you view the verse, "The Lord does not delay his promise, as some account of delay, but is longsuffering towards you, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance", (@2 Peter 3:9)?
J.T. That fits in with what we are saying. It is Peter's confirmatory way; he is confirming Paul's remarks. He is dealing with scoffers who say, "Where is the promise of his coming? for from the time the fathers fell asleep all things remain thus from the beginning of the creation", (@2 Peter 3:4). They are willingly ignorant, as the apostle says, but he does not hint that he knows the day, nor does any one; we are to be in the attitude of *waiting* . But he says, the real cause is that God is longsuffering. He does not wish anyone to perish.
A.R. Would the partaking of the Lord's supper in the light of @1 Corinthians 11 be that we are expecting Him to come?
{306}
J.T. Yes; "announce the death of the Lord, until he come", @1 Corinthians 11:26. But the gathering up of impressions by instinct, as in the assembly, is what the brethren should notice. We should get right feelings or impressions there, to understand from the Lord that the time is near. The Spirit and the bride say, "Come", so that the end of Revelation gathers up the subject -- "I come quickly" the Lord says, chapter 22: 20.
W.B-w. In verse 10 of this chapter it says, "that ... we may live together with him". Is that the end in view here, at His coming?
J.T. Quite so. And then in verse 23, "Now the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly: and your whole spirit, and soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ". That is a very practical touch at the end, as to our whole spirit and soul and body. It is well worth taking into consideration, by each of us, as to how this works out. What one's spirit is, and what one's soul is, and then, of course, one's body; all are preserved. It is in view of the coming of the Lord. This epistle will encourage us to believe He will come before we die. The desire of the apostle is that the bodies of the saints should "be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ".
P.R. Why does the apostle say, "the God of peace"? Would you think it of great importance in view of the commotion of the present moment; the state of things around?
J.T. I am sure that is so. "The God of peace" is an assuring expression. In Hebrews, we have "the God of peace, who brought again from among the dead our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep ... perfect you in every good work to the doing of his will, doing in you what is pleasing, before him through Jesus Christ", @Hebrews 13:20,21. We are to be strengthened and settled in the midst of all the commotion.
{307}
P.R. In contrast to verse 3, where there are those who say, "Peace and safety".
J.T. Yes. One is so sensitive of being affected unduly by current public events, instead of waiting in faith upon God; as doing so our hearts and minds will be fortified with His peace.
J.H.E. The Lord said, "Peace be to you" when He came among the disciples, (@John 20:19).
J.T. He says it twice over there. In chapter 14 verse 27 He says, "I give *my* peace to you (@John 14:27)". It is very precious because there is so much commotion, and one has to own one is at times affected unduly by it, and perhaps we all are, so that we should endeavour to get into the realm of faith and peace.
A.N.W. Perhaps what you say accounts for the apostle saying, "the God of peace himself".
J.T.Jr. And then in verse 3, "When they may say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction comes upon them". There may be that kind of peace, but destruction comes upon it.
J.T. So that in this time of physical danger, especially when travelling, it is comforting that the body is in mind for preservation, as well as the spirit and soul. So that you feel you are in good hands, and nothing can happen without God. Not a sparrow falls without Him -- how much less a son!
A.B.P. Does the "God of peace" suggest that peace had its origin in Him and is controlled by Him?
J.T. It is one of the things of which He is God. It is an interesting matter -- the things of which He is God -- and peace is one of them. It would mean that He is the Originator of peace and He controls it.
W.B-w. It does not matter what troubles come in; He controls peace.
J.T. That is it, and, of course, faith rests on that.
A.P.T. @2 Corinthians 13:11 says, "the God of love
{308}
and peace shall be with you". Would that thought specially fit in there?
J.T. Quite so, in view of the restorative effect of Paul's letters.
A.N.W. Would @Psalm 91 be in keeping with this? I was thinking especially of verse 1: "He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty (@Psalm 91:1)". And then the Psalm speaks of Jehovah giving "his angels charge concerning thee", (@Psalm 91:11), and then, "Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him; I will set him on high, because he hath known my name",(@Psalm 91:14).
J.T. In keeping with what you quote, David says, "in the day of evil he will hide me in his pavilion; in the secret of his tent will he keep me concealed", (@Psalm 27:5).
{309}
THE LORD'S COMING (3)
@2 Thessalonians 1:7 - 12; @2 Thessalonians 2:1 - 16;@Romans 8:16 - 23; @Romans 13:11 - 13
J.T. It has been intimated that our consideration of this subject should be constructive, not simply taking isolated passages for each occasion, but selecting them from the epistles in chronological sequence as nearly as known, so as to see how the truth of the Lord's coming developed in the minds of the apostles. We are now considering the writings of the apostle Paul, and how he treats of the subject in each epistle according to the understood bearing of the epistle; each having its own particular features of the truth. It is a very extensive subject and, of course, enters into the Old Testament as well as the New. Its place in the epistles is particularly important, because they are written directly to ourselves.
It has been already remarked that the Thessalonian epistles are first in order. It is to be noted that the second epistle to the Thessalonians contemplates that they were rather losing ground, and thus were somewhat exposed to error. They had been affected by false teachers, and had particularly lost ground as to hope. Our subject is intended to inspire hope in our souls. The first letters shows that these saints were marked by hope, but it is not alluded to as marking them in the second epistle. If we keep that in mind, we may be helped, for hope is hardly a feature that marks the saints. The Lord might help us as to it.
J.S. In what way would hope affect us?
J.T. It tends to detach us from this world and also to keep us from discouragement on account of conditions in it. Normally, Christians rejoice in hope.
W.R. Does not the epistle to Titus help us as to
{310}
hope? The apostle says, "... awaiting the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ; who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all lawlessness, and purify to himself a peculiar people", @Titus 2:13,14.
J.T. Yes, and Romans, too, the fundamental epistle as to the gospel, stresses hope, as we shall see. The apostle commends the Thessalonians so far; he says, "We ought to thank God always for you, brethren, even as it is meet, because your faith increases exceedingly, and the love of each one of you all towards one another abounds", @2 Thessalonians 1:3. They were not wanting in faith or in love, but they were lacking in hope, evidently, and this would be caused by some deflection which the enemy had effected. The suggestion was made to them, that the day of the Lord was present; and it was a question of what they were working out then; that, of course, would destroy hope.
A.R. Are you referring to verse 2 of chapter 2?
J.T. Yes. The evil teachers were saying that the day of the Lord was present, based, perhaps, on certain features of human sufferings connected with it, ignoring its positive blessings. Instructed saints would see how fallacious that is. And then they were undergoing persecution, and no doubt the enemy took occasion to suggest to them that such conditions marked the day of the Lord. So the first chapter is to show that the persecutions were really normal to Christians, and that it was intended to help them and make them worthy of the kingdom of God; persecution helps us as it is thus accepted. It is not the day of the Lord, but the day to prepare us for it; and tribulations, and persecutions help us. That is the point, the apostle makes. On the other hand the persecutors will be dealt with by the Lord when He comes. If it were His day. He would be dealing with these persecutors who afflicted the saints; He would be executing judgment upon them. The
{311}
fact that they were allowed to carry on their persecution against the saints would show it was not the day of the Lord. The apostle says further, verse 6, "if at least it is a righteous thing with God to render tribulation to those that trouble you (@2 Thessalonians 1:6)". It would be a righteous thing for God to do that, and He will do it. "And to you that are troubled repose with us", (that is, repose will be rendered to us; we will all be with the Lord at that time) "at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven, with the angels of his power, in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who know not God, and those who do not obey the glad tidings of our Lord Jesus Christ; who shall pay the penalty of everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his might, when he shall have come to be glorified in his saints, and wondered at in all that have believed, (for our testimony to you has been believed) in that day", verse 7 - 10. It is a remarkably well marked out thought. The enemy was deceiving them, that their persecutions were an evidence of the day of the Lord; whereas it was the very opposite; for when the day of the Lord is present, the persecutors will be punished with everlasting destruction, and they were not being punished as yet.
C.A.M. So that the "enduring constancy of hope"(@1 Thessalonians 1:3) in the first part of the first epistle was not a hope that things would get better. The fact that the apostle says, that right down to the very end things will get worse, would seem to emphasise the importance of an enduring constancy.
J.T. Exactly. "Hope maketh not ashamed (@Romans 5:5)". The truth of Romans builds it up in our souls, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given to us; that is what sustains the constancy of endurance.
W.R. There is a verse in @Isaiah 13 that may help in connection with persecutions: "Behold, the day of
{312}
Jehovah cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the earth desolate; and he will destroy the sinners thereof out of it ... and I will punish the world for evil, and the wicked for their iniquity", @Isaiah 13:9 - 11.
J.T. That agrees with this. So that saints are not thinking the day of the Lord is present because they are suffering. It is the righteous judgment of God to make us more suitable for the kingdom. This righteous judgment will culminate when God will render tribulation to them that troubled the Thessalonians, and when the saints should have repose, with the apostle "at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven".
P.A.R. To say the day of the Lord is present would really rob it of all its glory. The day will be marked by manifest power and glory. It is not the case at the present time.
J.T. It is man's day now in that sense; he carries on his riotous ways, persecution, or whatever he wills to do. All that will be terminated when the day of the Lord is here.
C.H.H. Does not the prophet Joel correspond? He speaks of the day of the Lord being at hand and of the affliction the people go through, and he calls them to return, saying, "Blow the trumpet in Zion", @Joel 2:1; and then, "turn to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning", @Joel 2:12.
J.T. It would have the same bearing. The apostle's remarks in the passage before us would direct the Thessalonians to the Lord so that they would not be occupied with the persecution beyond the fact that it was allowed in a disciplinary way to help the saints -- also as a privilege -- but the penalty of the persecutors would come in due course and it would be *awful --*  everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and the glory of His power. It is sorrowful that we are
{313}
so liable to take on false thoughts; the devil takes advantage of certain circumstances. The apostle said, "when we were with you, we told you beforehand we are about to be in tribulation", (@1 Thessalonians 3:4). And so the Lord, when with the disciples, told them about His resurrection and all that accompanied it, and yet the best of them, such ass Mary Magdalene, were looking for Him *dead* , when, according to His word. He should have been alive! How often circumstances occasion the enemy an opportunity to create unbelief and confusion in our hearts!
C.A.M. I suppose the message from John the baptist would show that, and inasmuch as he was the one who announced the coming of the Lord, Satan would use the fact that he was in prison to darken him.
J.T. It was the circumstances -- the prison. He would not have fallen into unbelief, I am sure, had he not been incarcerated. Thus circumstances often occasion the enemy an opportunity to baffle and discourage us. In Romans we see we are to put on the armour of light. This protects us against the influence of darkness.
A.N.W. In these epistles Paul treats of the two sides of the Lord's coming. In chapter 2:1 of this epistle he begs them, "by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to him".
J.T. The word "by" is noteworthy; he uses the event to urge them to stedfastness; it would be that the full thought of the Lord's coming should be in their hearts. It pours contempt on what the false teachers were saying, and would fortify their hearts against all darkening thoughts. The *coming* of our Lord Jesus Christ is the denial of the lie that the day of the Lord *had* come; and only gross falsehood could suggest that the saints, including the Thessalonians, were gathered together to Him.
W.B-w. When dealing with persecutors, the apostle calls the Lord's coming "the revelation of the Lord
{314}
Jesus from heaven", verse 7. Is there some special significance in the word "revelation" when it is a question of dealing with the persecutors?
J.T. The word conveys that what had been hidden or veiled, is now uncovered; sometimes to certain ones, but in this connection it will be manifest generally. "Whom heaven indeed must receive", Peter says, (@Acts 3:21); "and a cloud received him out of their -- sight", (@Acts 1:9). The revelation referred to here means that all the clouds and veils are to be removed. He is to be manifested; "every eye shall see him", (@Revelation 1:7). The book of Revelation opens up the significance of the word as used here.
W.B-w. This refers, then, to the time when He shall come out on a white horse as portrayed in @Revelation 19?
J.T. It is wonderfully depicted in @Revelation 19. There is no doubt about it. It is visible to every eye. As seen in that chapter He battles with sin in its most powerful development in men.
Now the subject in chapter 2 is the antichrist, or "the man of sin", as he is called; and the Lord's coming has him in mind. The apostle explains another side of the matter; that the man of sin will not come until there be an apostasy; that is another guide for the Thessalonians, and a guide for us, too. So that whilst the Lord from the outset intimated He would come quickly, this must be considered with other scriptural facts, including the fulfilment of certain events, such as we have here, before the word "quickly" applies. That is guarded in the apostle's remark: "Let not any one deceive you in any manner, because it will not be unless the apostasy have first come, and the man of sin have been revealed, the son of perdition", verse 3. These are two negative guides for us: the apostasy, which has now existed for centuries, but not yet completed, and the man of sin, who consequently has not
{315}
yet been revealed. In regard to him, we are exposed to deception -- this one and that one may be pointed out by some as antichrist. But the apostle puts us on our guard, giving us a life -- size picture of him. There has been no one exactly like him. He "opposes and exalts himself on high against all called God, or object of veneration; so that he himself sits down in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God", verse 4. And then the apostle goes on, "Do ye not remember that, being yet with you, I said these things to you? And now ye know that which restrains, that he should be revealed in his own time. For the mystery of lawlessness already works; only there is he who restrains now until he be gone, and then the lawless one shall be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus shall consume with the breath of his mouth, and shall annul by the appearing of his coming", verses 5 - 8. There have been men who prefigure the man of sin and some exist now, and he who sits in the Vatican bears some of his features.
W.B-w. It is a question of persecution in chapter 1; it is a question of deception in this chapter -- "Let not any one deceive you", verse 3.
J.T. Quite so; the persecution was the basis that the enemy used for the deception, but the apostle bring in another side of the position as to the day of the Lord, that it would not come until there had been the apostasy, and the appearance of the man of sin. @Revelation 19 shows the coming of Christ out of heaven in military power and glory, and the destruction of the man of sin -- false prophet -- takes place.
J.S. Is the spread of apostasy necessary for the introduction of the antichrist?
J.T. That is what is stated here. "The mystery of lawlessness already works", showing it had already begun. It was no question of the revelation of apostasy, but of the man of sin. It is to him the word "revelation" applies in this passage. The apostasy began in the
{316}
apostle's time and it has worked ever since, and that is the point we are to notice; it is increasing every day.
J.S. We see the work of evil running on concurrently with the work of God.
Ques. What temple is referred to in verse 4?
J.T. It is the temple of God. The word corresponds to the holiest; it is not the word used for the external buildings, but for the inner shrine of the temple, and that he sits down there is very solemn. It is a general thought. In Christianity, it is the saints, but it runs on to a coming day, too. It is a very remarkable thing that the two sons of perdition are referred to as having access to the inner temple. That is, Judas, who is called the son of perdition, and the man of sin are both spoken of as in the temple in the inner sense. That is a very remarkable thing! It cannot be in a spiritual way in the true sense, but by taking up a position like that, he is in the very place of God.
A.Pf. The man of sin is of a religious character.
J.T. That is right. Here he is seen in the temple of God. He is fully identified with the political power of his day, but he sits down in that which is called the temple of God. The papal office foreshadows this and hence prepares men's minds for it, but it does not go the whole way.
A.N.W. What do you mean by Judas being in the holiest?
J.T. That is what is stated. The money he received for the betrayal of Christ was cast down in the temple; and it is the inner temple that is alluded to, as if that dreadful bargain with the murderers of Christ was made there.
A.C. Is it not remarkable that the antichrist is entitled the "man of sin" in this setting?
J.T. The idea is that he is the embodiment of sin. It is the result of Satan working from the time he got in when Adam fell. Sin entered into the world through
{317}
one man. That is one thing, but that it should be embodied in a man is a terrible thing. Religion affords the enemy a greater weapon than politics for deceptive purposes, and our chapter has deception in view; "signs and wonders of falsehood, and in all deceit of unrighteousness", verse 9.
A.R. Would you say, from chapter 2:7, that antichrist will not come until the Spirit of God has gone? It says, "He who restrains now until he be gone".
J.T. There are two things spoken of as restraining in verses 7 and 8: "For the mystery of lawlessness already works; only there is he who restrains now until he be gone, and then the lawless one shall be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus shall consume with the breath of his mouth, and shall annul by the appearing of his coming". Earlier, we have *that which* hinders: "And now ye know that which restrains, that he should be revealed in his own time", verse 6. The Thessalonians were taught by the apostle about this; but in verse 7 he speaks about the mystery of lawlessness, and in this connection says, *"he* who restrains". The mystery of lawlessness had begun then, and there was a Person restraining it. Where has it been all these centuries? It is for the spiritual to understand. I think Satan has been working on religious lines all this time, in a certain setting; and there is the suggestion that the man of sin, when he appears, will have access to its innermost workings. No doubt there will be collaboration and a readiness to give way to him. He will have the upper hand and will have everything opened up to him in the centre of the system that we are alluding to. I believe this is what is in mind, in the statement that he sits down in the temple of God. That sort of thing has existed in part from the very outset. Later, it developed more formally and openly -- a man sitting down assuming to be God in *some* sense, not formal apostasy, for the Scriptures and Christ are verbally owned, but still the
{318}
thing is there. Thus, the pretensions of the man of sin will not be a novelty, but an increase of what exists; because the mystery of lawlessness has been working. Our scripture contemplates the culmination of it.
A.R. The presence of the saints would mean *that* which restrains; and *he* which restrains refers to the Spirit?
J.T. Well, it is well to keep the thing less fixed in one's mind. The stress is on the word "restrain", whether it be ordered government, or whatever it be that restrains, but "he", I suppose, would point to the Spirit; and the revival of the truth of the Holy Spirit in the assembly in the latter days surely is intended by God to expose all this, to show us what this chapter means.
C.A.M. Do you think that is why the Holy Spirit presents the truth of the temple -- temple light - which is often realised at the present moment?
J.T. That is an important remark, because we have more of the temple in the book of Revelation than in any other book, and obviously it is to meet what is before us here, so that we might understand the whole position and know how to move in relation to it.
J.S. Does it show, too, that lawlessness will run its course until the man of sin sets himself down in the temple of God showing himself that he is God?
J.T. Yes; as is said in Genesis, "For the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full", @Genesis 15:16. The Lord is allowing wickedness to develop in one way and another until it comes to finality in the man of sin. The book of Revelation teaches us that there is a trinity of evil; but here, one person is referred to, similarly as we speak of God. God is a Trinity, and so the completion of Satan's working is a trinity; a most solemn fact to consider; and it is all around us now.
C.N. You were stressing the word "hope". Is not the rapture the climax of the Christians¬ hope here?
{319}
J.T. Well, the coming of the Lord is more properly our hope -- rather Himself and all that attaches to His coming. All this is public; the rapture is included, but it is private; the assembly is thus with Him, so as to come into display with Him. The rapture is formally presented in the first epistle, and is alluded to in verse 1 of our chapter. It is treated of by itself for a special reason, but it contemplates the appearing with Christ in glory. Allusion to the Lord's coming is usually to the public side, and it runs right through scripture. Here we have the word "appearing". It says, "whom the Lord Jesus shall consume with the breath of his mouth, and shall annul by the appearing of his coming". And then we have the antichrist coming; "whose coming is according to the working of Satan in all power and signs and wonders of falsehood, and in all deceit of unrighteousness to them that perish", verses 9,10. Thus, there are the two comings; the coming of antichrist and his destruction at the coming of the Lord Jesus. They are direct opposites. The Lord will annul him by the appearing of His coming.
C.H.H. Is there a moral order in @Revelation 11,12 and 13? The temple is seen open in heaven in chapter 11; then in chapter 12 the male child is caught up to heaven, and in chapter 13 we have the revelation of the two beasts. Is that in line with what you were saying about the temple being prominent in that book?
J.T. Yes; the position is thus made clear. The Lord has revived the truth of the temple -- more recently particularly -- and it enables us to know the truth, so that we are to be assured of what we say. We should speak only in the sense of inquiry, unless we are assured of it. So that the sure way to know the truth is to inquire in His temple, and the Lord is helping us to do that, I think. One can speak with a measure of authority as he inquires in the temple. "If any one speak -- as oracles of God", (@1 Peter 4:11). We are not to be guessing at things
{320}
or questioning all the time, but we say what we know, and that is in virtue of the Holy Spirit, so that the apostle says, "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God?" (@1 Corinthians 3:16).
J.H.E. The Lord said to Nicodemus, "We speak that which we know, and we bear witness of that which we have seen", (@John 3:11).
J.T. The Lord said that, and, of course. *He was* the temple, but the *principle* we are speaking of is there.
J.T.Jr. The chapter already alluded to in John's epistle speaks of the way we are to know the thing; "From this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error", @1 John 4: 6. Is that not important whenever crises arise, to know the spirit of truth?
J.T. Not only what is said, but the *spirit* behind it.
J.T.Jr. You feel either the thing is right, or it is wrong.
W.B-w. The question of the love of the truth is brought in here. It says, "because they have not received the love of the truth that they might be saved. And for this reason God sends to them a working of error", verse 11. Is this working of error going on all around us today? They have refused the love of the truth that they might be saved.
J.T. A very important word -- "the love of the truth". One has often ventured to say it is even a greater thing than the love of the brethren. John makes a great deal of it in his epistles: people doing truth and walking in truth; and then in his gospel he says, "But when *he* is come, the Spirit of truth, he shall guide you into all the truth", @John 16:13. He quotes the Lord as saying the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of truth.
A.R. What did you say about the love of the brethren?
J.T. I was venturing to say that one thinks that love of the truth is morally greater than loving the brethren, although they go together, but I believe love of the truth comes first in order. The truth has the first place in a moral sense; the truth precedes even the brethren.
{321}
The Lord Jesus is Himself the truth, and the Holy Spirit as spoken of here is the truth, which facts, of themselves, show how great the thought is. And we have in the truth the means of detecting and correcting all that is *not* truth.
F.H.L. It is remarkable that the Lord said before Pilate, "I have come into the world, that I might bear witness to the truth", (@John 18:37).
A.N.W. I suppose your reference to love of the truth would be confirmed in Peter's reference to adding to brotherly love.
J.T. Well, quite so. Love according to God involves the truth; it would correct any undue personal links, which are very baneful amongst us; brethren having personal links with each other -- personal understandings -- offer a handle to the enemy, who works on those lines.
A.R. Would you say that even after the assembly is gone, it will appear that evil never gets out of divine control. It says here, "And for this reason God sends to them a working of error", verse 11. The thing is seen as under divine control.
J.T. It is one of the most solemn things, that *He sends* it to them, that they should believe a lie because they have not believed the truth. It says in @Revelation 22:11, "Let him that does unrighteously do unrighteously still". That is a remarkable thing, as much as to say, if there is continuance in unrighteousness, God will leave it at that; it is a most solemn thing! But then, He *sends* the working of error that they might believe a lie. The gospel, on the other hand, is the word of truth, which saints normally believe.
We might now scan the verses referred to in Romans. There, it is a question of the creature in relation to the Lord's coming. "For the anxious looking out of the creature expects the revelation of the sons of God: for the creature has been made subject to vanity, not of its
{322}
will, but by reason of him who has subjected the same, in hope that the creature itself also shall be set free from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groans together and travails in pain together until now. And not only that, but even *we* ourselves, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, we also ourselves groan in ourselves, awaiting adoption, that is the redemption of our body", @Romans 8:19 - 23.
I thought it might be well to touch that, just to show how the idea of deliverance of the creature, involved in the Lord's coming, is introduced in the great gospel epistle. Paul said that the gospel was proclaimed in the whole creation, showing that the creation is in God's mind. It is not now a question of the antichrist, but of the bondage brought in through sin; and how this great day we are looking for means deliverance for the creature "into the liberty of the glory of the children of God". Our part in it is as *sons* of God: the liberty is that of the glory of the *children* of God. The culmination of the truth here is in sonship. "Awaiting adoption, that is the redemption of our body". Our bodies are to be changed and in accord with the full thought of God; not only that we are sons now, according to verse 14, but our bodies are to be according to that; they are to be changed -- conformed to Christ's body of glory.
J.S. So that we have a far wider thought here in Romans than in the epistle to the Galatians.
J.T. Yes; redemption here is the change of our bodies -- sonship -- which we await. Many of us are suffering in body, and many are dying; well, what a truth this is! The adoption is really sonship; it is the same word that is translated sonship; the redemption of our bodies implies that. The creation began with the thought of it, according to His own word in Job. "The morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy", @Job 38:7. So that we come into this in a literal
{323}
way, for the word "adoption" is applied to the redemption of our bodies.
J.S. So that this is undoing all that came in as a result of the fall.
J.T. And making things infinitely greater than they could have been in the physical creation as it is now. "The glory of the children of God", (@Romans 8:21), implies "the revelation of the sons of God", wonderful prospect as to our bodies! We are all groaning more or less; and if some, being young, are not groaning now, they will be in a few years if left here below. What a wonderful thing, then, this is -- the deliverance of our bodies -- under the head of redemption and sonship!
J.T.Jr. So that there is no further scope for sin's law to operate. It says, at the end of Romans 7: "So then *I myself* with the mind serve God's law; but with the flesh sin's law", @Romans 7:25. There is a complete change, and sin's law has no further place to operate.
J.T. Just so. In the earlier part of the chapter we have, "on account of the Spirit which dwells in you". Then, in @1 Thessalonians 4:17, it says, *"we* , the living who remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds". Quickening will take place on account of His Spirit in us; but it goes beyond that to the resurrection of those that are in their graves, which is referred to here as the redemption of the body.
A.R. Would you explain verse 21 as regards the creature being set free from the bondage of corruption?
J.T. Well, it is the general abstract condition of the creature on account of sin having come in; being subjected to bondage. It is commensurate with Romans, because the gospel, in God's mind, includes the creation; not only man, but, according to what He said to Jonah, cattle also; even the cattle are clothed with sackcloth -- a very touching thing. Then Paul says of the glad tidings: "which have been proclaimed in the whole creation which is under heaven", @Colossians 1;23. I think
{324}
we have narrowed ourselves in the gospel a little bit, confining it to men. Directly, of course, it does apply to men, and men only; but, as seen in the scripture quoted, in the thought of God it applies in a sense to the whole creation. The creature itself will be delivered from the bondage of corruption. The glory of the children of God is our glory, and the creation comes into that. Well, in one sense it should come into it now, if I own a cow or a horse, or if I have children or servants, they should come into the liberty of what I am enjoying myself.
J.S. So that the animals of the creation, now living in fear of one another, will come into holy liberty. That is a remarkable thought, is it not?
J.T. Quite so; what a change it will be! "The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb", (@Isaiah 11:6). It is affecting to think of such a change as God will bring about in His creation.
J.S. Would that mean that carnivorous creatures will cease?
J.T. Evidently. It does not seem that there were any before the flood; it is clear that in the liberty of the glory of the children of God there will be a great change from the present carnivorous and ferocious conditions. @Isaiah 11: 5 - 9 is very clear as to this. The lower creatures are coming into it; but there should be that testimony now, that all that comes under our influence tastes something of the liberty of the children of God.
P.A.R. One of the things that is to mark the sabbath is, "thou shalt not do any work, thou, ... nor thine ox, nor thine ass", (@Deuteronomy 5:14).
J.T. That enters into it. If a man is spiritual, he will have all that is under him in this liberty; because he is already in the enjoyment of the privileges of the children of God.
A.R. Is the basis of it the death of Christ?
J.T. Quite so. That is what Romans lays down; it is
{325}
the foundational epistle and it goes as wide as the whole creation.
C.A.M. Is that the way to understand the expression "joint heirs with Christ"? If you do not view it as the whole vast creation you cannot understand it.
J.T. Yes; your heart is stimulated if you take this in. See the present effect of it; it should influence everything that comes under the Christian's hand. He had said, "And if children, heirs also: heirs of God, and Christ's joint heirs; if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the coming glory to be revealed to us", verse 17,18. And then he proceeds with this subject of the creature and the glory of the children of God.
A.R. Would Noah's ark and the creatures in it under Noah's care be the same idea as creation being held in the hearts of the saints today?
J.T. They all came *unto Noah* ; but it is Noah in a *family setting* really, and that I think links up with what we have been saying about the children of God. There were eight persons in the ark -- Noah, his wife, his three sons and their wives; and it is in the ark, in that setting, that the animals come to Noah. It is the family setting in which Christ would be attractive, and all should be illuminated by that -- all that I have to do with should be illuminated by family relations, involving the glory of the children of God.
W.B-w. They are called the *sons* of God in verse 19, as in "revelation", and then in verse 21, reference is made to the liberty of the *children* of God.
J.T. The same persons are referred to. "For the anxious looking out of the creature expects the revelation of the sons of God". It is perhaps an unspoken expectation; it is abstract; we cannot say in whom the expectation is concrete, but it is there.
J.S. As to order, the sons must come in first.
{326}
J.T. Quite so; that is what we begin with in the book of Job. Jehovah began with that.
P.A.R. Would the revelation of the sons of God correspond with the thought of the holy city coming down out of heaven to influence the earth?
J.T. Yes; coming down in their liberty, dignity, and intelligence.
W.B-w. Would you say a word about the redemption of the body? Does that mean that our bodies have not yet been redeemed?
J.T. Not redeemed from the *effects* of sin, because when one dies it is evident that the body is not redeemed in a practical sense. The *person* is, in his spirit, because it has gone to be with the Lord; but not the body.
W.B-w. But it does not affect the redemptive work of the cross in any way.
J.T. Redemption was fully effected in the death and resurrection of Christ, but the working out of it involves *our* resurrection; taking the body out of all the effects of sin. Here we are said to be awaiting adoption and that adoption means the redemption of our body. In this sense redemption is not yet *completely* effected, nor are we the sons of God in an absolute way until we are raised from the dead *literally* , or our bodies quickened, @Romans 8: 11; because our bodies are yet mortal. Redemption takes us into immortality; the body is raised in incorruptibility and immortality.
J.S. These bodies of ours are still in the groaning creation.
A.N.W. Does that link on with your further scripture at the end about our salvation being nearer?
J.T. Exactly; that fits with this epistle. The apostle is bringing in subjects in the epistle that belong to it, and it is a question of light -- armour is called the "armour of light" in this epistle. It is called the "armour of God" in Ephesians, but in Romans it refers to the saints as in the wilderness. In Ephesians we are said to
{327}
be raised up and seated in the heavenlies; but the viewpoint here is that we are in the wilderness in our every-day employment and hence need the armour of light. Darkness presses in on every side, but we are to meet it with light; whatever assails, you meet it with light. And hence the word is, "This also, knowing the time, that it is already time that *we* should be aroused out of sleep; for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed", @Romans 13:11. That is important; every moment brings us nearer to it. It is a question of *time* . From this point of view, the epistle says later on, "But the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly", @Romans 16:20. And also, "The night is far spent, and the day is near; let us cast away therefore the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. As in the day, let us walk becomingly; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and lasciviousness, not in strife and emulation. But put on the Lord Jesus Christ", @Romans 13:12 - 14. That is, put it on as a *real* profession, which can only be in the power of the Spirit. The idea is that you are covered with it; you are luminous. If persons come with dark thoughts, you are able to meet them with the armour of light. It is a military idea, for it is a matter of conflict.
A.R. Is all that the result of making room for the Spirit? The apostle speaks of the firstfruits of the Spirit in chapter 8. He also gives us in @Galatians 5 what the fruits of the Spirit are.
J.T. Quite so; nine features of the fruit of the Spirit are given. Romans requires that for the support of the truth and then it greatly stresses *hope* , as we have already said. In chapter 15:13 we have, "Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that ye should abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit @Romans 15:13". I am convinced that hope is one of the scarcest things among the brethren. That is, we do not see much outside the current environment; but what is
{328}
unseen is eternal. "What any one sees", says the apostle, "why he does hope also (@Romans 8:24)?" We hope for that which we do not see.
W.B-w. What is the difference between putting on the armour of light and putting on the Lord Jesus Christ?
J.T. The latter brings Christ into His place as covering the whole position. The armour of light is the military thought. Putting on the Lord Jesus Christ is a full profession supported by the Spirit; whereas the ordinary Christian profession today is not that; there is profession, but generally no reality.
J.S. And in putting on the armour of light, it is not that we might shine but rather that the Lord Jesus may shine in us.
J.T. Well, exactly, and you cannot be cornered if you have on the armour of light, because you can meet, with light, whatever comes up; you *know*, as the apostle says here, "This also, knowing the time, that it is already time that *we* should be aroused out of sleep; for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed".
A.R. We may have been inclined to think of hope in relation to the rapture, but what you have said helps us to see that we are to think of Him in relation to another world; that helps to take us out of this one.
J.T. Hope relates to what is not seen; it is what is presented to *faith* . You not only believe it, but have certainty that the thing will come to pass.
Ques. Is our hope in proportion to our knowledge of the righteousness of God?
J.T. That is the foundation of all we are speaking of -- the righteousness of God. All these things are built up on that.
{329}
RULE BY INFLUENCE
@Genesis 1:16; @Psalm 19:4 - 6
Reference to the household at a meeting like this is most appropriate, because it is in mind in the covenant which has just been entered into by our brother and sister. The prevalence of references to it in the gospels and epistles only confirm its importance: the house of Chloe and the house of Stephanas, for instance, manifestly buttressing the assembly at Corinth. The allusions to these households by the apostle in his first letter to Corinth, would show how important a place the thought had in foundational times; and the work at Corinth was foundational. The letter was written not much more than two years after the work began, therefore the house had clearly a great place in foundational teaching; so much so that Paul, in disclaiming having received commission to baptise, nevertheless said, "Yes, I baptised also the house of Stephanas" (@1 Corinthians 1:16); he would stress the thought of the baptism of the *household* of Stephanas; and the allusion to that same house at the end of his first letter would show that its baptism was not in vain. Household baptism is a foundational thought, and the truth of it was confirmed in Corinth in due course; for those of that household had devoted themselves to the saints for service; they were persons of spiritual influence; persons to be submitted to.
I thought that what has been read from Genesis and the Psalms would support this thought; for in the very solar system we have the household suggested in the sun, the moon, and the stars. We do not get the names of the two great luminaries in the first chapter of Genesis, but rather *what they are* , the one is the "greater light", and the other the lesser. Both lights enter significantly into the idea of the household and marital relations;
{330}
in later scriptural instruction they represent husband and wife. Polygamy was not in God's original thought as to marriage, nor was it in His thought at all. So that the greater light, the lesser light, and the stars are suggestions of the household. We know that the Spirit of God used them in one of the dreams of Joseph just in this sense. @Genesis 37:9,10. The second dream, which called forth the envy of Joseph's brethren, involved the household. His father understood the reference and rebuked his son for it; nevertheless he "kept the saying". And that is the true way to get at the truth: to observe things as they appear. We may reject them at first; many a person has been rebuked for things said, and those who have done it came to accept what they had refused. Jacob kept the saying of Joseph, so that it became part of his spiritual treasury. The truth of the household is strikingly seen throughout his generations. We are told in Exodus, that the heads of the tribes came *with him* into Egypt. "With Jacob had they come, each with his household (@Exodus 1:1)". Let no one, if he holds the true idea of the household, admit of its being broken up. Noah prepared an ark for the saving of his house, and Israel's houses in Egypt were strikingly preserved of God. Not only was the firstborn saved through the blood, but the houses were delivered, @Exodus 12:27. So the patriarchs, the sons of Jacob, came down into Egypt, each with his household, and the houses were preserved. In entering Egypt they were not to become part of that country; they were maintained in distinctness apart from it. God said to Pharaoh, "I will put a separation between my people and thy people", @Exodus 8: 23.
So, as I said, the Spirit of God places this thought in the heavens into which everybody that has eyes can look, and does look. There is the greater light, and the lesser light, and the stars also. They are *lights* . The influence is below, but it is a family circle in type, as
{331}
Joseph's dream proves. So the application is to our brother and sister entering on the marriage relation. Most of us here have been long in it, and no doubt, each would have to admit how poorly he has set out the divine thought in it. The full divine thought is Christ and the assembly in public display. It will come, for no thought of God can fail or become merely partial; it must find itself fully expressed in Christ and the assembly.
In Israel, as seen in @Revelation 12, we have a remarkable allusion to the same thing. She is clothed with the sun; she has taken on that great idea; and the moon is under her feet, another great thought -- subordinate authority; and then a crown of twelve stars. So that the thought alluded to has expression, not only in Christ and the assembly, but also in Israel. The idea of clothing is that a thing is put on, or taken on definitely. One idea entering into this meeting is really that we might clothe ourselves with thoughts attaching to us in the divine mind, as thus presented to us by the Spirit. So our dear brother may well clothe himself with the suggestion in "the greater light" in this first chapter of Genesis. The sun is referred to elsewhere as a bridegroom. The Spirit of God in David says that God has set a tent in the heavens for the sun, @Psalms 19:4. He cherishes the thought; the sun must thus involve a great thought spiritually, being worthy of a tabernacle. It obviously refers to Christ. In this sense. He is not to be concealed; He comes forth as a bridegroom out of His chamber, and rejoices as a strong man to run the race. Our dear brother may have a long race before him; our dear sister may have a long race before her also, God knows; but this is the principle. All the felicitous features of the bridegroom in his vigour and strength are seen there; he goes forth as a strong man, he is not to be an idler and sit down, but to run a race, and the whole house or domain in which
{332}
he is comes under his influence; such an influence as is conveyed in the sun as seen in this remarkable Psalm.
So that we see how God brings great thoughts into a time like this and would fill us with them. There would be something for those who have been long on the marital pathway, those who have just come into it, and those who may be about to enter into it. It is a divine thought; indeed, we are enjoined that every man is to have his own wife. There are, of course, exceptions, as the chapter I allude to stresses, @1 Corinthians 7, but this is the general thought. So marriage is peculiarly of God, and as in it, we are to be clothed properly, invested with right thoughts; hence we see here, how influential the sun is as seen in the character of a bridegroom. And then the moon, the lesser light, but relatively a great light, and suggestive of great power; making a circuit, according to the way we speak: she is to rule, too. The idea is, I apprehend, not arbitrary rule, but *rule by influence* ; indeed, that is the divine way; that is the most effective way -- rule by influence. The sun has inherent power to do this. The moon has not; she is dependent, taking her light from the sun; yet she is classified as a light with power to rule. So that our brother and sister as set in the marriage relation are, it seems to me, seen here in type, and the suggestion of radiated glory, seen in these orbs, is to be carried in them into the new sphere of things, the new household now formed. Reference is sometimes made to one's brightest day, as though it is a matter of history, but why may I not have a brighter one? Is it not possible? The scripture says, "the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, and my Spirit remain among you (@Haggai 2:5)". That, as realised, would make our days even brighter. Why not? *More* is an important word in scripture. We are to attain to what is "more excellent"; that is, more so than anything hitherto reached.
These heavenly bodies, as we have said, convey the
{333}
idea of light and rule, and every added household "in the Lord" is a new sphere for the exercise of these great services. It is an extension of divine borders. The husband and wife are to function in this way. It is the extension of what is of God, affording testimony to Him in the most practical way. "And the stars also" -- they have their influence, too. God calls the heavenly bodies by name, we are told. Each has its own significance; he alludes to the "bands of the Pleiades" -- an allusion to a family cluster. The constellations of the heavens are better understood by others than I apprehend them, but they are studded with divine thoughts, and by the Spirit of God we are to see how they apply to us. Are we reflecting light and rule as set by God in this great city? Do we answer to it personally and in our households? Is there radiation of light, the light of life there? Cities are full of the influences of unbelief: corrupt things that the enemy would bring into our houses. God is speaking to us about these things -- that our houses should be the extension of divine influence. Every marriage *in the Lord* is therefore of advantage to us, because it means expanse of divine influence, of service, too, for there is protection and enjoyment there in the way of hospitality.
That was all I had in mind: just to keep the thought of the sun and other heavenly bodies in our minds as illustrative of rule in our households. Deborah said, "Let them that love him be as the rising of the sun in its might", @Judges 5: 31. May the Lord help us all that there may be a greater reflection of these things with us individually, and in our households.

THE LORD'S COMING (4)
@1 Corinthians 1:4 - 9; @1 Corinthians 4:1 - 5; @1 Corinthians 5:5; @1 Corinthians 11:26; @1 Corinthians 15: 20 - 28; @2 Corinthians 5:1 - 10
J.T. The connection in which the Lord's coming is referred to in each of these scriptures is to be noted. In the first chapter, it is in relation to the enrichment of the assembly in the way of knowledge and gift; in chapter 4, it is in relation to the ministers; in chapter 5, it is in regard to assembly discipline; in chapter 11, to the Lord's supper; in chapter 15 it stands related to the truth of resurrection; and in the passage read in the second epistle, it is linked with the dissolution of the bodies of the saints. So that we have a wide range of truth connected with our subject, bearing on the assembly viewed as in the local position.
The first point to be considered, is how we are furnished. The apostle said, "I thank my God always about you, in respect of the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus; that in everything ye have been enriched in him, in all word of doctrine, and all knowledge(according as the testimony of the Christ has been confirmed in you), so that ye come short in no gift, awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ; who shall also confirm you to the end, unimpeachable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ", chapter 1:4 - 8. This is an allusion to the history of an assembly -- it may be any assembly of God -- and the viewpoint is the confirmation of the saints in what is furnished in Christ as they await the day of His revelation. So that it is the history of an assembly right through until the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
The present is the time of the testimony of our Lord Jesus Christ. The revelation will take place when the time of testimony is over; in that sense, in Christ's
{335}
day. The apostle has in mind that the assembly should go through as it began -- unimpeachable -- and confirmation is needed for that. And then there is the faithfulness of God in view of all this, as it says, "God is faithful by whom ye have been called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord", verse 9. That is the present position.
W.R. Is not the fidelity of the assembly proved in local assemblies during the Lord's absence?
J.T. Quite so; it is the local assembly that is in mind here. It is well to go back to the beginnings of any meeting; the meeting in which any one of us may be. What were the beginnings, and how are we going on, and what have we in view? Have we the day of Christ in mind in all that is going on?
C.A.M. How do you apply this word "confirm" at the present time -- confirmation in the local setting?
J.T. Usually, as to what comes in as the foundation is laid. The true foundation being laid, it should give character to the structure. It is reliable material, so that in chapter 3, the apostle calls attention to the building. He laid the foundation. They were God's building, which is a very dignified thought. He had laid the foundation, "But" he says, "let each see how he builds upon it", @1 Corinthians 3:10; and in connection with that, if he builds wood, hay, and stubble, that would not stand the test of the fire, and hence only *he* goes through. He loses everything except himself -- "but *he* shall be saved, but so as through the fire", @1 Corinthians 3:15; all else is burned up, and it is connected, too, with the *day:* "for the day shall declare it", @1 Corinthians 3:13. It is a voice to us, as to what we are putting into the building; that is, primarily, the meeting in which we are located.
A.R. Is it right to abstractly regard a locality as the apostle speaks of Corinth: "in everything ye have been enriched in him, in all word of doctrine, and all knowledge", chapter 1:5?
{336}
J.T. Yes; that is the abstract view. It is not that every one in Corinth was *characterised* by that, but in principle the assembly could be so spoken of; God had confirmed the testimony of Christ there.
J.S. Does gift play a large part in the maintenance of the testimony?
J.T. It does; that is the idea. They came behind in no gift; the opening statements of the epistle are remarkable, seeing the apostle is going to deal with very serious evil conditions among them.
W.B-w. We get the testimony of *our Lord* elsewhere, and the testimony of *God* , and here the testimony of *Christ* . What is the difference?
J.T. I think the *Christ* is generally the one who *does* things for God -- the One who does all God's will, according to @Psalm 89. Paul had worked amongst them according to the principle of the anointing, and the assembly is alluded to in chapter 12:12 as "the Christ", so that it was for them to maintain that. What was being done was Christ's work. It was the testimony of Christ. It was Paul's work, but Christ had spoken to him in a vision and said, "I am with thee, and no one shall set upon thee to injure thee; because I have much people in this city", (@Acts 18:10). He stayed there eighteen months and showed what Christ's work was -- God confirming it. In Ephesians, Christ is said to be dwelling in our hearts by faith; meaning the One who operates for God. Of course, it includes the anointing, but it particularly suggests the One who operates -- who does things.
A.B.P. Do the details given in relation to the heavenly city help us in working things out locally, in view of that day?
J.T. Yes. You want to make things *fit* with that. You have that in your mind. John brings the city in, in view of the latter days; our own times. Paul also speaks of it, "Jerusalem above ... which is our mother", (@Galatians 4:26).
{337}
It is a question of taking character from our mother, and the *faithfulness* of God is to be noted here. It is a very comforting word. It is found three times in the two epistles. It says, "God is faithful, by whom ye have been called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord", verse 9. Our position in the fellowship is assured; we can rely upon the faithfulness of God in it. The faithfulness of God is a great principle running through Scripture, especially in Jacob's history. It was to him that the thought of the house of God was revealed, so it peculiarly fits into the order of the assembly.
W.B-w. Does the matter of faithfulness fit in with the word "confirm you to the end, unimpeachable"? God is faithful, but the saints at Corinth were unfaithful.
J.T. To meet the responsibilities conveyed in the two epistles, you need to draw on the faithfulness of God. Jacob was going down into Egypt and no doubt serious questions would arise in his mind, especially as to how he could meet conditions there. How can conditions in Corinth or New York be met, the opposition being great? Well, this thought of faithfulness fits, and so Jehovah appeared to Jacob and said, "I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down to Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation. I will go down with thee to Egypt, and I will also certainly bring thee up", (@Genesis 46:3,4); meaning that every promise of His is Yea and Amen in Christ. That is what you get in the second epistle to the Corinthians. When the time comes for it, God will show that, for recovery already began to set in amongst them. Jacob was in a position now to understand what God meant by saying He was the God of his father. It is not Abraham, but *Isaac* . Abraham was the depository of the promises, but Isaac had their confirmation. Christ, risen and glorified, is the Amen of every promise of God. That is an immense thing to have in our souls.
{338}
J.S. Jacob went down to Egypt in the light of the God of resurrection.
J.T. Exactly, That is, that whatever might happen in Egypt, God's promises would all go through. That is a principle.
C.A.M. Does not this show that where things are wrong in a local company, the positive position according to God is to be in mind at the outset?
J.T. I think so. It is the fellowship of God's Son; the fellowship of Christ's death in chapter 10; the fellowship of the Spirit in @2 Corinthians 13:14. Here it is the dignity of the fellowship; that you have a sense of the dignity of what you are called into. Some one may say, I am withdrawing from fellowship. What does it mean, but withdrawing from the greatest thing on earth? Where is he going? Is it simply optional with one to do that? No, it is not; he will have to answer to God for it. It is, *in principle* , apostasy.
A.N.W. In regard of unfaithfulness, would you make a little clearer how we can look for unimpeachability in that day?
J.T. Well, the faithfulness of God known in your soul helps you greatly. In result you say, "kept guarded by the power of God through faith for salvation ready to be revealed in the last time", (@1 Peter 1:5). On the one hand God does it, but still you are doing it. You have the great thought here of the dignity of the position, and that the local company is to be unimpeachable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is not only each one individually, but the whole assembly. Places enter into the divine records, not only persons, but assemblies; and the towns in which they are located, and the countries also. Everything is kept in mind in the divine record. How is New York going to stand in that day, the day of our Lord Jesus Christ, when everything is going to be manifested? The apostle is speaking of the assembly from the divine standpoint; what his
{339}
work had been; the apostle having been there for eighteen months. I am sure he did not leave until he saw the truth worked out in some sense subjectively, in the saints there. From the divine side they had an excellent start. He stayed there longer than in any other place except Ephesus; of course, not counting his imprisonment at Rome.
A.R. Does not the government of God take account of a believer, and his conduct, in view of that day? Here, however, it is in connection with a locality.
J.T. Yes, each of us will be responsible in his measure in relation to his local position. I think that is important for each of us to see. And then, each city in which God has set a testimony is responsible, too, but that is another matter; and so each country. The Lord says, "Woe to thee, Chorazin! woe to thee Bethsaida!"(@Matthew 11:21). The whole of Achaia is referred to in @2 Corinthians 1:1, for instance; and in our chapter it says, "the assembly of God which is in Corinth, ... with all that in every place", @1 Corinthians 1:2. Wherever God sets an assembly, there is correlative responsibility in the place, because of the testimony rendered to it, for the Lord shows that testimony to them. The Lord will be able to point in His day to what light there had been here or in any town or city where there had been a gathering.
F.H.L. Is there not a great appeal to the Corinthians in the way the apostle presents here what was effected among them, including the temple of God as in chapter 3?
J.T. It is from the divine side; in a sense, abstract, yet there must have been some concrete expression of it; but this indicates how Corinth was furnished, and what was effected there. Chapter 3 takes up what we put into the building, and whether we are going into the day of Christ with nothing but ourselves to our credit; *saved, so as by fire* ; just belonging to such a
{340}
class in that day. Then in chapter 4, the apostle speaks of himself and every minister with him; that the One who examines them is the Lord, and the examination will come to light when the Lord comes; that is, there are certain things that we must leave until the Lord comes; as it says in verse 5, "So that do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord shall come". That does not mean that we do not judge things for which the present is the time of judgment, such as evil amongst us; we must deal with that at once, but to judge the motives of a servant, for instance, would not be in order, for the Lord examines him, and we have to wait until the Lord shall come. These are special ministers. The passage reads, "Let a man so account of us as servants of Christ", verse 1. The word "servants" is *huperetes* in the original, and means "appointed servants". (Three words are translated "servant" -- *doulos* , a slave, bondman; *diakonos* , a person who acts or waits in service; and *huperetes* , as here, which is always used for an official servant. -- J.N.D., foot-note.) These were special men that God was putting forward, and people were apt to be critical of them. Of course, they have to answer, as other brothers, for their conduct and service, but they are often the butt of unfair criticism, as Paul was at Corinth. That is what he is dealing with, so he says, "Let a man so account of us as servants of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God"; it is apparent that he is speaking of what is special. And then he goes on in verse 2, "Here, further, it is sought in stewards, that a man be found faithful. But for me it is the very smallest matter that I be examined of you or of man's day". The poor conditions in Corinth led to their decline to man's way of judging; for instance, they said, "his presence in the body weak, and his speech naught",(@2 Corinthians 10:10). That is "man's day". The apostle poured contempt on it. Think of such a servant as
{341}
Paul, through whom so many were converted in that city, and some one in that meeting saying that his speech was contemptible and his bodily presence weak!
It is that sort of thing that he had in mind when he went on to say, in verse 3, "Nor do I even examine myself. For I am conscious of nothing in myself; but I am not justified by this: but he that examines me is the Lord. So that do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord shall come, who shall also both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and shall make manifest the counsels of hearts; and then shall each have his praise from God", verse 3 - 5. That is an important matter, and particularly as regards those who are in public service. Of course, if there are things that are wrong, they must be dealt with, but if it is a question of a servant's motives, leave it with the Lord, for "to his own master he stands or falls", (@Romans 14:4). The Lord is jealous as to His servants. Jehovah said to Aaron and Miriam, "Why then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?" (@Numbers 12:8).
A.N.W. The verse in @1 Corinthians 10:15 says, "I speak as to intelligent persons: do *ye* judge what I say",. We are called upon to do that, are we not?
J.T. Quite so: the Bereans did that as to Paul's ministry among them. The question here is of judging *him* as they judged him at Corinth. As I said, if there is anything wrong, the servant is a brother like others. The Lord would protect His servants from *unfair* attacks.
J.T.Jr. Does the Lord do that of Himself in regard to His servants, as He did with Moses? When a servant is attacked unfairly, the Lord protects him. The servant does not do it himself.
J.T. That is good. Moses was not complaining about the attack of Miriam and Aaron. The Lord took it in hand; not that Moses did not feel it. The Lord looked
{342}
after His servant. Paul, like Moses, was special. The Corinthians were like children examining their father -- that sort of thing; "For if ye should have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers", (@1 Corinthians 4:15); and he *was* their father. This is on even a wider basis than that. It is this *kind* of servant that is in mind; an appointed servant. Of course, you would not attach that to everyone now, but you keep the thought in your mind how the Lord puts certain ones forward and holds them responsible; therefore they are specially cared for by Him.
J.S. So the first verse of this chapter would give us the light governing the position relative to the servant: "Let a man so account of us as servants of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God".
J.T. That is good; you look at one who is helping the saints and take right account of him; do not idolise him, but take right account of him according to what the Lord has made him.
W.B-w. Was there not a worse condition later, according to the closing chapters of the second epistle? Then there were those who "sinned before, and have not repented (@2 Corinthians 12:21)". There seems to have been a good number of them.
J.T. I was alluding to that; one of those men said, "but his presence in the body weak, and his speech naught(@2 Corinthians 10:10)". But Paul says, "such as we are in word by letters when absent, such also present in deed", (@2 Corinthians 10:11). The time had come for him to speak of those things: "and having in readiness to avenge all disobedience when your obedience shall have been fulfilled", (@2 Corinthians 10:6). He is going to deal with all these men, but He has in mind to protect and preserve the saints.
No doubt, all, with those who had not repented, were present when the first letter was read, but the apostle wisely avoids direct reference to the opposers
{343}
until the saints, generally, were ready for it. The party leaders might have become more powerful if they were *then* attacked by Paul. He is very wise in that. He would set the brethren generally right before he attacks these special ones, and here in the first epistle he does not name anybody, but himself and Apollos and Cephas. He says, "these things, brethren, I have transferred ... to myself and Apollos",(@1 Corinthians 4:6) instead of naming local leaders. We have to be careful that we do not force saints into the hands of local leaders who in times of crisis would seek to control them. It is wisdom to get the saints right first. We have to *wait* . God is patient in dealing with evil. The apostle, in this first epistle is not naming anybody who is attacking him. It is a general thought. He says, I have transferred it to myself and Apollos. *They* were not the leaders in Corinth; local men were the leaders, but they were *misleading* the saints. In chapter 5 the apostle deals with an outstanding sin, such as was not even named among the Gentiles; he selects it to bring out the great principle of assembly discipline. The apostle says, "that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus", @1 Corinthians 5:5. But the Corinthians are to have this man with themselves, as restored, as the second epistle shows. Everything in these passages is linked on with Christ's day. How are we going to stand there? What are we doing now? We may be doing what we think is right and what others think is right, but notwithstanding, we may *not* be doing right. How will all this stand "in the day of the Lord Jesus"?
J.S. The sequel shows that this man was recovered before Christ's day.
J.T. It was a very great triumph. The Corinthians were slow to recognise his self-judgment; but still there it was, and the apostle tells them to confirm their love to him. They are going to carry him through, as it were, until Christ's day.
{344}
A.B.P. To what extent can we do that? In a case where discipline may be necessary, how do we carry the person?
J.T. In our hearts and in our prayers, and in priestly service generally. The types help us greatly as to feeling in a priestly way; visiting and looking upon the person. @Leviticus 13 and 14 are especially written for that purpose.
Ques. If there is not a quick recovery, does that reflect on us?
J.T. Well it *may* . Perhaps we are wanting in priestly ability. The type calls for the priest to go out to the man. The priest visits and revisits him, and when the time of his cleansing has arrived, the priest goes out to him. They are both *outside the camp* . Really, by extension of the type, it is like Christ and the thief on the cross; both are outside the camp. And the Lord took the thief to paradise; that is. He carried him through, but He could never do it without dying for him. They were both outside the camp -- "Wherefore also Jesus, that he might sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered without the gate", (@Hebrews 13:12). The Lord took the thief to paradise; He died for him. The priest goes outside, we are told, in the type, to see the man that is to be cleansed, and then he orders what is to be done.
C.A.M. The securing of the thief on the cross, I suppose, was the result of the service of the great Priest. *What he said about the Lord* suggests that the man had an offering to bring.
J.T. Quite so; in principle, he spoke of His perfect humanity. He was really ministering to the Lord in what he said. He spoke *of* Him: "this man has done nothing amiss", And then he spoke *to* Him: "Remember me. Lord, when thou comest in thy kingdom", (@Luke 23:42); and the Lord took him right through. He says, "Today shalt thou be with me in paradise", (@Luke 23:43).
{345}
I think that enters into the discipline meeting; we are to carry the sinner through, that is our object.
J.S. The moment he testified of the Lord, saying, "but this man has done nothing amiss (@Luke 23:42)", light flooded his soul. Then he adds, "Remember me. Lord, when thou comest in thy kingdom (@Luke 23:42)".
J.T. Well, he judged the position rightly and thoroughly; he took the guilt home to himself, and thus the light shone into his soul from the dying Saviour beside him. They were both outside the camp. The Lord was suffering personal wrong, but then, He was suffering *vicariously* ; otherwise. He could not take the thief to paradise. I believe that is the way we take account of the leper, as to how we deal with him, taking the thing in our spirits, as it were; the Lord did that. He took the whole weight of that thief's guilt upon Himself.
W.B-w. The Lord was unique in holiness and purity, but in Leviticus the priest has to wash himself afterwards.
J.T. That is to show what the thing is that he is dealing with. Of course, the Lord touched the leper without being defiled in His person. He could do that, but on the cross. He took sin in its entirety upon Himself and dealt with it vicariously, and came out of the grave without it. So the thief is in paradise entirely according to God.
A.R. Would you explain, a little more fully, this verse about the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ?
J.T. Well, the flesh cannot go into paradise, nor can it stand in the day of the Lord Jesus. The Lord dealt with it on the cross vicariously, but it has to be dealt with *in me* , and normally it is dealt with in me when I put to death the deeds of the body. "But if Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin", (@Romans 8:10), and "but if, by the Spirit, ye put to death
{346}
the deeds of the body, ye shall live", (@Romans 8:13). We put to death the deeds of the body, by the Spirit. That is our side of judging. This man had not done it, and was delivered over to Satan, and Satan has to do it. What he should have done by the power of the Spirit, Satan has to do, and evidently did. The book of Job helps in this.
J.T.Jr. In @Leviticus 14, we have the log of oil introduced. It seems to indicate that was lacking, before, in the man; as though room has not been made for the Spirit.
J.T. Quite so; he was not judging himself - putting to death the deeds of the body. And so in Corinth; the sin was most flagrant. The flesh was allowed full range.
A.Pf. Would you put Ananias and Sapphira in the same class -- delivered to Satan for the destruction of the flesh?
J.T. Well, they died in their sin. I believe they were Christians, for they got a *burial* . Ecclesiastes speaks about no burial: "If a man beget a hundred sons, and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, but his soul be not filled with good, and also he have no burial, I say an untimely birth is better than he", @Ecclesiastes 6:3. It seems to me that the burial of these two by the young men waiting there to do it, indicates they were honoured in spite of their guilt. They died in their sin, of course. The daughters of Zelophehad said of their father, "but he died in his own sin", (@Numbers 27:3). Ananias and Sapphira died in *their* sin, in collusion with one another, it is true, but I should say they were saved in the sense of "so as by fire".
A.N.W. Does an assembly action necessarily do what was done in @1 Corinthians 5 -- commit one to Satan - or is that apostolic? In the second letter he says, "Sufficient to such a one is this rebuke which has been inflicted by the many", @2 Corinthians 2:6. Is that our side?
J.T. The former is connected with Paul, and linking
{347}
it on with other scriptures, I should say it is apostolic action. He speaks of delivering others to Satan, but he is bringing the Corinthians into it here. "This rebuke" refers to the way that they looked at the sin. It was "by the many"; it was *their* action, although evidently some did not go with it. The saints generally felt indignant about the sin. The proper responsibility of the saints is stated, I think, in the last verse, "Remove the wicked person from amongst yourselves", @1 Corinthians 5:13. The assembly must not have such a person in its midst. In @Numbers 5, the leper is to be put outside the camp; whatever happens, that must take place at once: "Remove the wicked person from amongst yourselves (@1 Corinthians 5:13)". We can hardly say that withdrawing from a person is delivering him to Satan, but still that sort of thing goes on. God looks after that side of the matter.
J.T.Jr. Leaven is alluded to in order that we might see how quickly it will spread: "a little leaven leavens the whole lump", @1 Corinthians 5:6. If the thing is not dealt with, does it not spread and involve all?
J.T. That is what is stated; it "leavens the whole lump". In Corinthians, the evil is licentiousness, but in Galatians, it is *legality* , showing that one is equally as bad as the other.
Now the next link in our subject is in chapter 11. Of course, there are other references to that day, such as judging angels and judging the world, but we cannot look at all these scriptures, but the one in chapter 11 is of peculiar importance; it affects us every Lord's day, for it refers to the Lord's supper: "ye announce the death of the Lord, until he come", verse 26. That is our outlook as we recognise His rights, and it cannot but draw out the enmity of the world, as responsible for His death. They may not show it, because religious sentiment modifies their feelings, but the opposition is still there. "The great city" is "spiritually Sodom and
{348}
Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified", (@Revelation 11:8). What a great thing it is that in this city there are those that carry on in this way until the Lord comes. The Lord's coming is thus kept freshly before us.
C.H.H. In @Leviticus 14:1 it is said that the leper was to be brought to the priest, before it is said that the priest was to go outside the camp to him.
J.T. Well, that would be in the sense of testimony. The thing is brought to you, and then going out to where he is, is the principle that there is identification with *that position* . The Lord Himself suffered outside the camp. It is only to enlarge upon the position of the Priest as seen in Christ as entering into death.
C.H.H. Would that involve a distinct work in the one under discipline, which would be brought to the attention of the priest?
J.T. That is the idea -- that recovery is taking place. Chapter 13 shows that that has been going on, but chapter 14 contemplates that the man outside the camp is healed of the leprosy, and now the priest goes out to him. There is testimony as to his state and progress, and now the priest goes out to him. Death takes place outside; the bird is killed there.
C.H.H. Concerning the inspection, does the type warrant that we should go out to one who is judged as a leper? Does it give liberty for anyone to visit such, apart from a particular testimony that there is healing?
J.T. No one should visit such except as a characteristic priest. If I visit on social lines I do harm. People do that, ignoring the judgment, and visit on mere personal or social lines, and you might say link with them, which practice is very wrong and damaging. @Leviticus 14, verses 1 - 4, says: "This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: he shall be brought unto the priest, and the priest shall go out of the camp; and when the priest looketh, and behold, the sore of leprosy is healed in the leper, then shall the priest command ...".
{349}
The priest finally decides the matter. He is outside the camp, but the time of the cleansing of the leper has come, for the whole previous chapter shows how that comes about. Bringing him to the priest would mean that the priest is acquainted with his progress, but then it finally says, "And when the priest looketh, and behold, the sore of leprosy is healed in the leper",(@Leviticus 14:3); that means he has reached the final judgment of it.
Ques. Would that be seen in Paul telling the Corinthians to again receive the man put away?
J.T. Quite so; he judged the thing and evidently knew the time of cleansing had come. He is acquainting them with it. In @Leviticus 14 the leper is *brought* to the priest, which would mean that the priest is made acquainted with his progress; but then before judging as to him, the priest goes outside the camp, meaning that *the man is still outside* ; and then he *commands* . When "the sore of leprosy is healed in the leper, then shall the priest command (@Leviticus 14:3,4)". He then proceeds with the mode of cleansing.
P.A.R. Is healing entirely the work of God?
J.T. It is, but the man's self-judgment goes with it. And the priest helps, through the application of the divine directions for cleansing.
W.B-w. The leprosy is *named* , according to @Leviticus 13.
J.T. Yes; you have it in its different phases, too. The priest goes to visit the man, and finally proclaims that he is a leper, and the man goes outside the camp and says. Unclean, unclean. *He is not excusing himself. He avows everything as it is* . Then chapter 14 is a new commandment from Jehovah; that is to say, when all enquiry is over, the work of grace having proceeded, and the leprosy healed, he now has to be *cleansed* . Healed leprosy is not enough. *He has to see the bearing of all that has happened* , then to be restored to his
{350}
place inside, to resume his privileges in communion with God and His people. The healing is by the Lord, but it is in connection with the self-judgment of the leper. In the antitype there is appropriation of the death of Christ for cleansing. "Blessed are they that wash their robes", (@Revelation 22:14). @Leviticus 14 is the cleansing. It is a new commandment; it says, "And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying. This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing", @Leviticus 14:1.
C.H.H. Numbers 5 requires that every leper and unclean person be put out of the camp.
J.T. The point in Numbers 5 is that the camp is holy and it must not be made unholy by anything. The wicked person *must* be removed; put him outside, "being such", as the apostle says. That is due to God in His house, but then the healing and the process of cleansing come after that. The person in question being our brother, restorative love becomes active, both in God and in the saints.
C.H.H. What would correspond to the *tarrying* until one is restored, like in the case of Miriam?
J.T. That is really a dispensational thought, in @Numbers 12. There has been an interruption in the testimony relative to Israel on account of the persistent guilt of the Jews being fastened on them judicially. The journey will be resumed as the nation is again owned of God. At the same time, there is the thought that you do not want to go on without your brother or sister; we want them cleansed and with us. I believe this enters into these two epistles; that the Corinthians were not to leave this man behind them.
J.T.Jr. The fact that they were slow to deal with the sin, and also slow to recover the man, would show that priesthood was not wholly functioning at Corinth.
J.T. Yes. The first epistle contemplates the absence of priesthood. The apostle says, "And ye are puffed up, and ye have not rather mourned", @1 Corinthians 5:2. Priestly
{351}
sensibilities would at east lead them to mourn because of such wickedness amongst them.
Now we may go on to the thought of resurrection, as connected with our subject. It is an immense thought. Chapter 15 connects the coming of the Lord with the resurrection: "But each in his own rank; the first-fruits, Christ; then those that are the Christ's at hi coming", verse 23. The word *rank* is important. There is this remarkable parenthesis, for the verses read form a parenthesis, which runs on to the final eternal position, so that we are let in here, in our subject, to the greatest possible things -- "that God may be all in all", verse 28.
C.A.M. So that in a sense, in this passage, there is really no space between the glorious triumph of resurrection and eternity itself?
J.T. That is how it is treated: "But each in his own rank; the first-fruits, Christ; then those that are the Christ's at his coming", verse 23. That is one thing. "Then the end, when he gives up the kingdom to him who is God and Father; when he shall have annulled all rule and all authority and power. For he must reign until he put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that is annulled is death. For he has put all things in subjection under his feet. But when he says that all things are put in subjection, it is evident that it is except him who put all things in subjection to him. But when all things shall have been brought into subjection to him, then the Son also himself shall be placed in subjection to him who put all things in subjection to him, that God may be all in all", verses 24 - 28. That is one of the most wonderful scriptures we have.
J.S. Although the subject opens with the statement: "Then the end", what follows is the way to it, is it not?
J.T. Yes. And then the last verse read is the great end in view: "that God may be all in all", verse 28. The details of the millennium -- the earthly side -- are
{352}
passed over. The resurrection of the saints, then caught up, @1 Thessalonians 4, to be with Christ at His coming, is the second thought; and then the end. So that it is the heavenly side that is contemplated here. The truth as regards the Jews and the millennium is left out.
Ques. Would it be right to say that the mediatorial position of Christ will be given up?
J.T. He becomes subject "that God may be all in all"; but I cannot say that the mediatorial position is given up, because we can only be in relation to God, even eternally, through the Mediator. We can never see God in His abstract essential Being. So we are dependent upon Christ's mediatorial service throughout. That is a matter to be looked into. It is a most important matter, too, because it might be assumed that when we are risen and glorified we can be with God *directly* as Christ has to do with Him. That is not so. We have always to depend upon Christ in our relations with God. God is said to dwell "in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor is able to see", (@1 Timothy 6:16); this does not weaken the thought of revelation, which is as real now as it will be throughout eternity, but refers to His abstract essential Being, which, as is said, is beyond the creature's power to see.
C.A.M. Verse 22 reads, "For as in the Adam all die, thus also in the Christ all shall be made alive". Are the heavenly saints only referred to here, or does that include Old Testament as well as New Testament saints?
J.T. The apostle is dealing with the heavenly saints; he is not stressing the heavenly, but still he says, "such as the heavenly one, such also the heavenly ones. And as we have borne the image of the one made of dust, we shall bear also the image of the heavenly one", (@1 Corinthians 15:48,49). That is what he is leading up to, but we can hardly leave out any of the families of the redeemed from the statement: "in the Christ all shall be made
{353}
alive". And "those that are the Christ's" would include the Old Testament saints.
A.N.W. Can such a statement as, "then the Son also himself shall be placed in subjection to him who put all things in subjection to him", be anything but mediatorial?
J.T. I think not. It is a mediatorial position. The economy goes on in that way. How can we be in relation with God? it is always through Christ: "For through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father",(@Ephesians 2:18). The apostle in @1 Corinthians 15 summarises things. We have the details elsewhere, but the passage reads, "For he must reign until he put all enemies under his feet". That is the mediatorial *reign* . What is called specifically, or officially, mediatorial will go on until He subdues everything; and of course that takes in the millennium, but it is summarised here very briefly, because the apostle has in his mind how the resurrection of the saints in our *rank* links up with *the end* . That is what he has in mind. This is a summary of what happens until God is all in all; so we are brought to the finish of things.
A.C. Why is subjection so much stressed here?
J.T. Because it is so much needed; at Corinth, especially so. It is *always* needed while we are in our present state; and even when a Christian is about to die. It is a most lovely thing to see a Christian die *in faith* . @Hebrews 11 refers to those of whom it is said, "All these died in faith", @Hebrews 11:13. Dying in *active* faith, like Jacob, is a peculiar testimony to the power of Christianity.
A.C. Is it not very touching that the Lord takes that subject position through the eternal day?
J.T. Quite so; that is how He will be eternally, but then you cannot limit Him to that. That is a truth, but then there are other things that are true also; He never
{354}
ceases to be God. We must leave the inscrutable, while fully recognising it is there.
C.H.H. Does headship continue? I have in mind the passage in @1 Corinthians 11:3 "Christ is the head of every man",.
J.T. Quite so; that, however, bears more directly upon the present time, but still He is said to be "head over all things", (@Ephesians 1:22); that continues.
W.B-w. In @Colossians 3:11, it is said, "Christ is everything, and in all", chapter. Here, it says, "that God may be all in all". What is the difference?
J.T. Well, as I said, we have to make allowance for other scriptures, when we are dealing with a particular one. Whilst He is subject; whilst the Lord Jesus took the position of being a bondman, we must never assume that it covers the *whole* matter. It does not, because as to His Person He is *God over all* , @Romans 9:5. It is well to keep that in mind, so that we may be balanced by the truth. It is the Son who is subject. It does not say who places Him in subjection -- I suppose it is Himself.
I was going to remark on the dying saints and the thought of victory; that we may now, in turning to chapter 5 of the second letter, link this on with it. The passage read deals with the dissolution of the saints, if it happen, and the state of the saints in view of that; that they are not really looking for it; they are looking to be "clothed, that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life", @2 Corinthians 5:4; but the attitude of mind, described, begins with verse 16 of chapter 4; "Wherefore we faint not; but if indeed our outward man is consumed, yet the inward is renewed day by day. For our momentary and light affliction works for us in surpassing measure an eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things that are seen, but at the things that are not seen; for the things that are seen are for a time, but those that are not seen eternal @2 Corinthians 4:16 - 18. For we
{355}
know that if our earthly tabernacle house be destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For indeed in this we groan, ardently desiring to have put on our house which is from heaven; if indeed being also clothed we shall not be found naked. For indeed we who are in the tabernacle groan, being burdened; while yet we do not wish to be unclothed, but clothed, that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. Now he that has wrought us for this very thing is God, who also has given to us the earnest of the Spirit". Now, the coming of the Lord is involved in our being clothed. It seems to me this passage ought to be taken into account very specially by us in view of possible dissolution; not that we are expecting it. Faith, characteristically, does not expect it. Faith looks for being clothed. The point is that we are looking at what is unseen. It is not merely the idea of looking for the Lord to come, and not expecting to die. That may be mere theory. Many speak thus, but on mere theory, without the corresponding feeling. The corresponding thought is that we are characteristically looking at what is not seen, which is eternal; so that, when the time of dissolution comes, we are ready. If we are ready, we die triumphantly, because it is only a moment until we have our house which is from heaven. We have been waiting for our house from heaven, but the Lord sees fit to allow death, and we are triumphant; it is a question of His will. I believe that is one of the most important things today. Many of the saints are growing old, and facing possible dissolution, and to have everything clear in our minds so that we die in faith, and thus die triumphantly, is most important.
W.B-w. In @Hebrews 11:21,22, we are told what two of the Old Testament saints, who died in faith, were doing when they were dying: "By faith Jacob when dying blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshipped
{356}
on the top of his staff. By faith Joseph when dying called to mind the going forth of the sons of Israel, and gave commandment concerning his bones",. Does that illustrate what you have in mind?
J.T. It does; and we may go on to Moses; how he looked at things; and many others. "All these died in faith", @Hebrews 11:13. Some of them died more brightly than others, but still, that is the principle of how to go into death; it is *in faith* . It is as knowing that if our tabernacle be dissolved, "we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens". That is faith; you are occupied with what is unseen, which is a most important matter. It is looking at the things that are not seen, which are eternal. And then the apostle says further, in chapter 5, "Therefore we are always confident, and know that while present in the body we are absent from the Lord, (for we walk by faith, not by sight;), we are confident, I say, and pleased rather to be absent from the body and present with the Lord. Wherefore also we are zealous, whether present or absent, to be agreeable to him", verse 6 - 9. So that he would rather be absent from the body than continue on here, but still, his main thought is, not to die, but to be "clothed", to put on his "house which is from heaven". This includes what is taught as to resurrection in the first epistle, but the heavenly side of the truth is in mind.
J.S. Why does he say, "if our earthly tabernacle house be destroyed"?
J.T. That is as to physical condition; it is corruptible, but it is to be raised in power and glory, incorruptible; so the identity remains. The word "destroyed" refers to what is physical. In resurrection it takes up another condition altogether.
A.R. How do you look at something you do not see?
J.T. It is "the things that are not seen" (@2 Corinthians 4:18); what you
{357}
do not see, you *hope* for; it is what Christ is above and what is connected with Him. Christ is the centre of "that world". The Spirit enables you to look at it. It cannot be seen as other objects around you, but still it is equally real.
C.A.M. Would you say that while it is possible for a saint to die in a sense of triumph, inasmuch as every enemy is gone, this matter of being linked with what is unseen, in the second epistle, is something more wonderful, involving the purpose of God?
J.T. Yes; it is a great thing to die in faith, as we have said. To maintain this attitude of looking at unseen things is of immense importance. Seen things become less and less to you; you are in spirit in that world. The Spirit alone gives you power for this, to see that which is not seen by the natural eye.
R.W.S. Would Paul's reference to "being poured out", (@2 Timothy 4:6), be anything like this?
J.T. That is the idea of a drink-offering, referring to what he was for God in laying himself out for service and now about to be martyred for the truth. He was fragrant to God. He says elsewhere, "But if also I am poured out as a libation", (@Philippians 2:17). He could speak also of the time of his release having come and of having "finished the race". That is special, as also what Peter says, as to putting off his tabernacle. But both apostles wrote for the saints and their remarks are intended to help us as to the death of the saints. What is the attitude of our minds in view of possible death? We are to be already living in the unseen world, and as falling asleep we are "with Christ", to await the resurrection of our bodies. Our hymns help us as to the unseen. The Spirit of God alone can give us to look at the unseen things.
C.H.H. Scripture says, "we see Jesus ... crowned with glory and honour", (@Hebrews 2:9).
J.T. That is the great general thought. It is in *the*
{358}
*book of the opened heavens* . It is, in a way, the opening up of Stephen's vision; experience, on the principle of what we have here; we see by spiritual eyesight, and look at things that are not seen.
A.R. As writing these things, Paul is looking outside the physical body and he has an insight into something substantial in a spiritual sense; what there is in heaven, prepared for him.
J.T. Quite so; it is "our house which is from heaven". It is not that we go up there to get it. It is to convey the thought of our heavenly *condition* as raised. It is not let down like something visible, but it is the power of God in our resurrection that also effects this. That is illustrated in the first epistle; the power of God takes the saints out of their graves, but the heavenly side of this great truth is presented in the scripture before us in the second epistle. Hence the apostle says, "He that has wrought us for this very thing is God who also has given to us the earnest of the Spirit".
{359}
THE LORD'S COMING (5)
@1 Peter 1:6 - 9; @1 Peter 4:12,13, @1 Peter 5:1 - 4; @2 Peter 1:16 - 21; @2 Peter 3:1 - 10
J.T. It will be borne in mind that these readings are on the subject of the Lord's coming, taking it in sections with a view to being constructive, and to this end the subject is being considered in relation to the purport of the books read.
Peter clearly deals with the government of God. The address in verse 1 would indicate this, for he writes "to the sojourners of the dispersion"; that is, the Jews that had been dispersed. Their proper setting would be in the land of Canaan, but under the government of God they had been dispersed throughout the countries mentioned. It was a question of God's governmental dealings with them, but as dispersed they find the Messiah outside the land of promise. The teaching of these epistles is to show that, notwithstanding the governmental dealings of God -- indeed, as accepting them -- we may come into the greatest blessings from God. The governmental dealings are not intended to hinder, but to promote our blessing.
Another thing to be borne in mind in this inquiry is that Peter in his early ministry speaks about the heavens; that the heavens must receive Christ "till the times of the restoring of all things, of which God has spoken by the mouth of his holy prophets", (@Acts 3:21). So that we are in the very midst of this time -- the period of the Lord's presence in heaven as Man -- His return to restore all things being now near.
J.S. They were sojourners there, according to the ways of God for a certain period.
J.T. Well, I think that is the point in the passage. According to Jeremiah, the salvation of the Jews at a certain time lay in going into captivity, both Jeremiah and
{360}
Ezekiel make that a point. Now they are in the dispersion, but they are there as sojourners; they are not settling down among the nations as of them. Furthermore, they have a heavenly calling, as the apostle says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, according to his great mercy, has begotten us again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead, to an incorruptible and undefiled and unfading inheritance, reserved in the heavens for you, who are kept guarded by the power of God through faith for salvation ready to be revealed in the last time", (@1 Peter 1:3 - 5). So that having accepted the dispersion, God has reached them and brought greater things to them than they had in the Old Testament promises. But I think that we are to see in these facts that the government of God is not against us; it may seem to be, but it really promotes our blessing. We are to *accept* it; it is in the acceptance of it that the blessing lies. They evidently accepted it and maintained their pilgrim character as sojourners.
J.S. So that in coming into Christianity they gained far more than ever Judaism could give.
J.T. Well, exactly. Jeremiah pointed out, that the good figs were those that went out under Nebuchadnezzar; they were "very good". And these books would show how acceptance of the government of God, whatever it might be, leads to our blessing; greater blessing than we might have expected.
A.R. Jeremiah speaks of Nebuchadnezzar as Jehovah's servant, does he not?
J.T. That was the point with Jeremiah; the way of life and peace was to come out, and of course it involved great persecution for him, for it *seemed* that he was working against the interests of his nation. Peter's epistles show the interests of Israel for the moment are outside the land of Canaan; God has come in in Christ, and, like Joseph in Egypt, He is known among the
{361}
Gentiles, and those of the Jews exercising faith in Him come into *a heavenly inheritance* .
C.A.M. You would say that Peter would have seen this working out in early church history when after Stephen's death, there was a persecution and a scattering, and the greatness of the Person of Christ -- in the truth of the Son of God, through Paul -- came into prominence after that.
J.T. Yes; he preached to the Jews in Damascus that Jesus "is the Son of God (@Acts 9:20)". The truth of the Son was committed to Paul to preach, @Galatians 1:16.
A.N.W. So that whether it be in relation to the government of God, according to Peter, or in relation to His purpose, according to Paul, both occasion blessing to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
J.T. Just so. And Peter supports Paul. He touches him very formally in the second epistle, and he supports his doctrine in the second chapter of the first epistle, showing that the Jews of the dispersion come into the house of God in a living way. They were living stones; they were built up a spiritual house, which touches Paul's line, and they were a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. And then in the second letter Peter calls attention to the epistles of Paul, as *scripture* , which he intimates were somewhat beyond some of the Jewish Christians; in fact, they were wresting them to their destruction. But still he significantly speaks of them as scripture -- "among which some things are hard to be understood (@2 Peter 3:16)".
W.R. Is it in this connection that Peter is regarded as the apostle of the kingdom?
J.T. Well, he is the apostle of the circumcision, @Galatians 2:7,8. He had "the keys of the kingdom of the heavens", (@Matthew 16:19); but what is before us contemplates him as the apostle of the circumcision. He is writing to them and calling attention to the great
{362}
things they would come into, with a view to confirming them in the blessing, that they might realise the magnitude of it.
P.A.R. Would the remnant in the beginning of Matthew, accepting the government of God and being baptised by John the baptist, realise the blessing we are speaking of, the Lord Himself taking His place with them?
J.T. Exactly; that enters into what we are saying. He came in as they were being baptised; He was not baptised first. You might say He was baptised last (@Luke 3:21), but it was because *they* were doing it that He could join them, and as joining them in baptism He is owned from heaven as the beloved Son in whom God is well pleased. So that all that enters into what we are saying; the Jewish remnant comes into the greatest things although dispersed; the point is they are accepting the judgment of God upon them. It is in the acceptance of the judgment of God that we come into greater blessing than we ever had. Their faith was to "be found to praise and glory and honour in the revelation of Jesus Christ".
W.B-w. And the government of God helps in the proving of their faith. Is that not the great thing? They had the faith for it.
J.T. Just so. Verse 12 of chapter 4 says: "Beloved, take not as strange the fire of persecution which has taken place amongst you for your trial"; and here, "that the proving of your faith, much more precious than of gold which perishes, though it be proved by fire, be found to praise and glory and honour in the revelation of Jesus Christ", chapter 1:7. That is, this epistle, and the following one, show how everything, as accepted in the government of God, favours us; we come into greater things than we had expected.
A.R. He very much elevates the idea of suffering, linking what they were experiencing with the sufferings
{363}
of Christ, does he not? We may be suffering governmentally, yet it is related to the sufferings of Christ.
J.T. Quite so, because Christ came in under those same governmental conditions, not on His own account, of course, but as entering into the position of Israel. Much of the sufferings in the Psalms contemplate governmental conditions. He took His place with the remnant and accepted the conditions there in the government of God. But then He has made a way out; He has borne the judgment of God, so that these dispersed ones come into all these blessings through Him; hence, "the sufferings which belonged to Christ, and the glories after these", (@1 Peter 1:11). Peter was himself a "witness of the sufferings of the Christ", and a "partaker of the glory about to be revealed", chapter 5:1. The public revelation of Christ and the glory accompanying it are in view throughout.
D.P. In what way is the government of God applied to us today?
J.T. Well, it arises from many causes: in individual cases, from earlier personal conduct, or conduct of parents or forefathers. In a general sense it is the result of racial conduct, death and other consequences of sin. Earlier national history, too, as evidenced in much that has happened in some countries in modern times. And of particular importance, as bearing on the present government of God, is the breakdown of the assembly. We are meeting here tonight, but not exactly as they met at Pentecost; the assembly was then the vessel of testimony. It is not that publicly any more. That is a sorrowful thing, and I cannot say that I have had nothing to do with that; but in the acceptance of it we come into the great blessings enjoyed by the assembly before it broke down. It is in the acceptance of those conditions that we come into these things.
J.S. And you would regard the government as favourable to us?
{364}
J.T. Well, that is the point, I think, in these epistles. It may seem otherwise, but it is favourable because of its results -- how God works in relation to it for our good.
P.A.R. Is it to bring about a state with us necessary to receive the blessing?
J.T. Yes; it works that way. These people clearly were accepting it; because they were not in Palestine, and yet they were coming in for the greatest things. The apostle can speak of their wonderful enjoyment. Take the word he uses: "ye exult, for a little while at present", verse 6; and then in chapter 4:13: "ye have share in the sufferings of Christ, rejoice, that in the revelation of his glory also ye may rejoice with exultation". He is contemplating the results of real Christianity enjoyed in exultation; turning a despised, persecuted people into a glorious people; an exultant people, on whom the Spirit of glory and of God can rest. What results these are!
C.A.M. Would you think that Peter was a very special one to speak on this line, inasmuch as he had passed through a great deal in connection with the sufferings of Christ? He knew he was to suffer death before coming into this glory.
J.T. Quite so; but he is modest in saying he was a *"witness*" of the *sufferings* and a "partaker" of the *glory* . He partook of the sufferings, too, but not as Paul did. Peter was martyred, of course, but I suppose Paul's sufferings exceeded those of any other, outside of the Lord Himself. The Lord said He would show Paul "how much he must suffer for my name (@Acts 9:16)". So that the apostle Paul was specially a partaker of the sufferings.
Our first scripture is to bring out the general position, in view of the revelation of Jesus Christ, as mentioned in verses 7 and 13 of chapter 1, and then the passage in chapter 4 is to show that the sufferings bring out that
{365}
"the Spirit of glory and the Spirit of God rests upon you", @1 Peter 4:14; as if the glory would be in the way of light and testimony among the nations. As the cloud rested on the tabernacle in the wilderness, so now with these Christians -- the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon them.
A.B.P. Does the incident of the tribute money in @Matthew 17 indicate how the greatest enjoyment might be arrived at through acceptance of outward governmental conditions? There would be the avoidance of offence with the authorities -- the tribute money would be paid -- but there would also be the conscious link of association with Christ in sonship.
J.T. That is very good, and is touched on here by Peter: "Shew honour to all, love the brotherhood, fear God, honour the king. Servants, be subject with all fear to your masters, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the ill-tempered. For this is acceptable, if one, for conscience sake towards God, endure griefs, suffering unjustly", @1 Peter 2:17 - 19. So that what you say as to @Matthew 17 fills out what is before us. They demand taxes, and the Lord points out that we should not be an offence -- pay the tax, although the sons (He and Peter) were free. He said: "give it to them for me and thee", @Matthew 17:27. So that Peter came into association with Christ in the acceptance of the governmental conditions.
A.N.W. Was not a large portion of Jeremiah's rebuke to the people because they would not accept the dispersion under God's government?
J.T. Yes. And in New Testament times they complained about Pilate mingling their blood with the sacrifices, but the Lord said that if they did not repent they would all likewise perish. They did not accept it; they were bitterly hostile to the Romans on mere national lines. Shall we pay tribute to Caesar? They inquire. He says, "Bring me a denarius", (@Mark 12:15);
{366}
and then, after inquiring as to the image and superscription, says, "Pay what is Caesar's to Caesar" (@Mark 12:17); the coin bearing Caesar's image was witness to their own servitude, but they did not accept it from God. But the saints contemplated in Peter's epistles accepted it and thus came into blessing from God. Deliverance from the Romans in Palestine is not promised, but what is greater was theirs -- an inheritance in heaven. And the faith through which they came into this inheritance was to be "found to praise and glory and honour in the revelation of Jesus Christ".
A.C. Why does Peter stress the thought of the appearing of Jesus Christ?
J.T. It is the public side; it is the hope of the coming of the Lord. The saints were to hope "with perfect stedfastness in the grace which will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ", (@1 Peter 1:13). Then all these governmental conditions will cease; our deliverance from them will be complete. Peter says to these saints of the dispersion, "whom, having not seen, ye love"; loving Christ, they would love His *appearing* .
A.C. It seems to be a kind of zenith reached; Paul speaks more of the rapture in the first epistle to the Thessalonians, but Peter would carry on the thought to the appearing.
J.T. Well, Peter speaks more of the public appearing than he speaks of the rapture. He alludes to the rapture only once or twice, but the scriptures generally refer to the public appearing of Christ. That is the great thought of scripture, and that is what runs through Peter's ministry here, although he says, in the second epistle, "until the day dawn and the morning star arise". That may mean the rapture; that is a secret thing that arises in the heart, but generally it is the public appearing he has in mind. And so in chapter 4 he shows that as suffering in the testimony the Spirit of glory and of God
{367}
rests upon them; but this is in relation to the "revelation of his glory". I mean to say that people are now seen suffering under the government of God -- *we* are -- and if we do not know it we *should* know it, and as knowing it, *accept* it. It is in the acceptance of it that God will honour us and He will make us a testimony; as accepting it we are a testimony to the fact that the church has failed. If we are anything, we are accepting it, and thus God honours us and brings us into the blessing. It is as in the position of the blessing, and manifestly sharing it, that we are a testimony, not merely because of the doctrines we hold. And that is what these scriptures show; they show an exultant state in the believers addressed.
R.L. Is the thought that in the coming day of the revelation of the Lord Jesus, there will be a manifestation of what has been wrought out now in the way of salvation in our souls?
J.T. Well, that is the point he makes in "receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls", verse 9. That is the *end* of it; it is complete salvation in the *soul* . We receive it now; body salvation, which is future, is Paul's side; Peter deals with soul salvation. We receive it now, and that, of course, will conform with our public position at the time of Christ's appearing.
W.R. Is that not why we need the governmental side to keep us always under control?
J.T. Well, to be subject to Christ is always an obligation, but I think it is in the *enjoyment* of salvation that we are subject; we thus accept the government of God in whatever it entails. It may be through the authorities, my own conduct, or in relation to my business or my employers; many such things become the occasion of the exercise of the government of God; if I am not subject, I miss the gain of it. It is in the acceptance of the government of God, even if it be consequent upon my own conduct, that I get blessing.
{368}
A.R. Does not chapter 4, verse 14 enhance the suffering of reproach in the name of Christ? The reproachers are blaspheming God, whereas those under reproach are glorifying God.
J.T. "On their part he is blasphemed, but on your part he is glorified @1 Peter 4:14". But you cannot be a testimony if overcome by pressure. We are under pressure now from different causes; the scattering of the nations from Babel; then, for Jewish believers, there has been the scattering of Israel; the failure of the assembly, also international strife. We are under these and other governmental conditions. Well, how are we to be a testimony? They press us down; they discourage us. These epistles show that Christianity, rightly understood, lifts us above them and makes us a testimony in them. That is the great lesson.
D.P. Do you mean that whatever apparently adverse position a believer occupies in the world, it may be accepted as the government of God?
J.T. Just so; whatever causes reproach, whether incurred by myself, or my father, or the country to which I belong, or the assembly, which is the particular thing, I am in it. We may say that we did not come into it of our own will, but we are in it, and these books show that our blessing lies in accepting that; but Christianity is greater than that and makes *me* greater than it, so that I am a testimony in it. That is the lesson in these books.
J.H.E. Would you get a concrete example of what you are saying in Paul before Agrippa?
J.T. Yes, and throughout his whole imprisonment. His epistles from his imprisonment are the greatest parts of scripture. They are buoyant, exultant, because of the power of Christianity; the power of the Spirit of God working in a man in great persecution.
J.T.Jr. The conscience is to be clear in all the vicissitudes through which one may go. Several times in
{369}
the epistle it is taught that the conscience is to be clear before God.
J.T. That is an essential; I am hampered if my conscience is not clear. I have lost power; like Samson, I am shorn of my strength.
G.A.M. There must be an immensity of blessing in accepting the government of God; and where the opposite is seen (in that Babylonish ecclesiastical system that claims to come from Peter), the glory is all going to disappear. To think that in accepting these conditions, there should be vouchsafed to us such precious light, especially as to the Person of Christ, is affecting.
J.T. To the princes of the system you refer to, Paul and Peter would say. You are reigning without us. But what particularly comes into this subject now, is that unless we are humbled and accept conditions from God, we will miss the blessing and will be no testimony at all.
E.S. Paul was the prisoner of the Lord.
J.T. Quite so; he was a prisoner of the Lord, and of Christ, too, meaning, he was not really a felon or a transgressor, but merely a *sufferer* . Thus, the Lord could use him.
C.N. Verses 13 - 19 of chapter 2 would support all you have been saying about suffering.
J.T. Yes; the passage reads: "Be in subjection therefore to every human institution for the Lord's sake; whether to the king as supreme, or to rulers as sent by him, for vengeance on evil-doers, and praise to them that do well. Because so is the will of God, that by well-doing ye put to silence the ignorance of senseless men; as free, and not as having liberty as a cloak of malice, but as God's bondmen. Shew honour to all, love the brotherhood, fear God, honour the king. Servants, be subject with all fear to your masters, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the ill-tempered.
{370}
For this is acceptable, if one, for conscience sake towards God, endure griefs, suffering unjustly @1 Peter 2:13 - 19". All that bears much on what is before us and is very practical. No doubt it touches us all.
J.T.Jr. And then it follows on with the thought of a Model: "For Christ also has suffered for you, leaving you a model that ye should follow in his steps: who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth; who, when reviled, reviled not again; when suffering, threatened not; but gave himself over into the hands of him who judges righteously; who himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, in order that, being dead to sins, we may live to righteousness", @1 Peter 2:21 - 24.
J.T. Well, all this shows that the Christian, whatever his circumstances, however much suffering may be entailed, is a witness to the superiority of what he has, as compared with those who may be above him in this world.
A.C. Do you not think there may be an increase in the government of God in the various forms it may assume at the present moment?
J.T. Yes, especially in countries that are immediately at war, where young men and others are under great pressure, and what these scriptures present is of the greatest value for all such. But what can be greater, in a way, than the Spirit of glory and of God resting upon the believer? It corresponds, you might say, with the tabernacle in the wilderness; the glory was there on the tabernacle, and it afforded guidance to the people. So that all who are marked by the Spirit of glory and of God are guides. They afford light to others in the midst of the pressure.
G.V.D. You see that in the attitude of the captives by the river of Babylon, in Psalm 137:1 - 4, how they were before their captors. They say, "By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down; yea, we wept when we remembered Zion. We hanged our harps upon the
{371}
willows in the midst thereof. For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that made us wail required mirth, saying. Sing us one of the songs of Zion. How should we sing a song of Jehovah's upon a foreign soil?".
J.T. It is important to have that passage before us. It shows that the true remnant did not settle down among the Gentiles, adopting their ways. Those addressed in this epistle are similar, "a remnant according to election of grace", (@Romans 11:5), but they are coming into Christianity in all its freshness. *They* would not sing a song of Zion in an ordinary unbelieving house; they kept separate from the world.
A.Pf. They would not eat the king's meat.
J.T. That is another point; "Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not pollute himself with the king's delicate food, nor with the wine which he drank", (@Daniel 1:8). It is a principle of superiority -- discriminating against what is polluting, although used by the king. Chapter 4 of 1 Peter leaves us with the Spirit of glory and of God resting upon us, and chapter 5 brings out *eldership --* an important matter in the dispersion, and under the government of God, because it is a question of experience. Peter says of himself that he was a "fellow-elder and witness of the sufferings of the Christ, who also am partaker of the glory about to be revealed", verse 1. It is the kind of thing that gives endurance, and at the same time maintains the elder brethren in humility; even Peter says he is a fellow-elder; that is, he belongs to the elders. It is a sort of balance, I think, with us, in caring for the Lord's interests, that we do not despise anybody who is doing it.
J.S. The glory, as over against the sufferings, would give him a great buoyancy in his soul.
J.T. I thought that; it is a word for all of us who are elders in the sense of age, and as you say it gives a certain buoyancy and dignity in serving the brethren.
{372}
J.T.Jr. Would the exercise of eldership be in view of "the glory about to be revealed"?
J.T. I think so, because the apostle runs on down here to the great Shepherd of the sheep. In Hebrews we are told that God has brought "from among the dead our Lord Jesus, thee great shepherd of the sheep in the power of the blood of the eternal covenant", @Hebrews 13:20. Christ has gone that way, and Peter says here: "And when the chief shepherd is manifested ye shall receive the unfading crown of glory", verse 4; the *unfading* crown; you may get a little glory among the brethren for a moment, but it may fade -- hence the importance of "the unfading crown of glory". I mean to say that Peter, in dealing with the government of God goes on to finalities, and we shall see in the next book that he goes on to the day of eternity; that is the great final day.
J.T.Jr. He also mentions in this chapter that the devil goes about "as a roaring lion". Is that to illustrate the way the enemy would attack the saints that have been dispersed?
J.T. I suppose so; they are exposed as in these circumstances. The dispersion implied an outward break-up of what had been in. But Peter had the keys of the kingdom, and coming into it in a moral way they were protected. If you face him and resist him, Satan will flee from you; that is, it is the power that is in yourself. It is not simply an external power. He knows the power I have; that he cannot overcome it, as I resist him.
J.T.Jr. Fleshly lusts are referred to in the early part of the epistle as warring against the soul, but here it is the devil, as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.
J.T. And then, "Whom resist, stedfast in faith, knowing that the selfsame sufferings are accomplished in your brotherhood which is in the world", @1 Peter 5:9
{373}
The allusion is to the power that is in the believer. Peter is pointing that out; that we are to "resist, stedfast *in faith*" -- it is not in natural strength, but in faith. We are also told, "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you", (@James 4:7).
F.H.L. Is not the whole position maintained in the beginning of chapter 1, where the apostle says, "has begotten us again to a living hope", @1 Peter 1:3, in relation to the governmental conditions in the dispersion?
J.T. Yes; "begotten us again to a living hope @1 Peter 1:3", as over against what is set out in the Old Testament as a first hope.
A.B.P. Will you distinguish between the ways of God, the government of God, and the activities of the enemy?
J.T. Well, of course God's "ways" have a special significance: they include what marks the effectuation of His purposes and His dealings generally, but especially with His people. His government is linked with them, adding the thought of rule or authority. A father chastens his child; he may have his own way in it, but it is his government. God's ways, I should say, historically precede His government, the latter implying that will or disobedience has to be dealt with. So that, I think, the ways of God would include His governmental dealings with us. But if it be His ways, as such primarily, it is *how* He accomplishes things; His ways with us would mean the *manner* of His dealings, I think. His ways are said to be "untraceable", @Romans 11:33.
C.A.M. Do you think it could be applied to the way of God being in the sanctuary? If I understand your thought rightly, you connect this glory with the cloud on the tabernacle. Peter would be one who was following that cloud in all its movements right up to finality.
J.T. Well, I think so; he followed it himself. As the tabernacle moved, Israel moved, and in @Acts 9 you see the movement; Saul of Tarsus was converted and he
{374}
had already begun to preach Jesus as the Son of God. That was a new testimony publicly rendered, because we have no record that Peter *preached* that He was the Son of God. It was a new thing, and it involved all that we have in 1 and 2 Corinthians, because the Son of God is stressed there. Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus preached the Son of God, and brought about assembly conditions in Corinth. So Peter, as already said, followed this line; it is like the movement of the tabernacle of witness. He says to Aeneas, "rise up, and make thy couch for thyself", (@Acts 9:34). Well, that is tantamount to saying -- as the truth came out in Paul -- that Aeneas is made to do something; he becomes able to do something for himself. He is able to rise; his palsy is gone, and he is going to do something in that town where he lives -- where he has been paralysed. Peter saw the cloud moving and he moved with it. And I believe that here he shows that the Jewish Christians in the dispersion were guides for others; that is, the glory rested upon them. So that it is for each of us to move as we see the lead indicated in a disciplined man, subject to the government of God, as the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon him. He is thus a guide to others.
C.A.M. It is striking how he does reach finality in that way; he regarded his own body as a tabernacle, and he could not have been a whit behind Paul's ministry in the end, as seen in the way he alludes to it in his epistle.
J.T. That is, I believe, the great point with him; his two epistles seem to represent him, as it were, as a ship on the sea. "There go the ships", we read in the @Psalm 104:26. They have a desired haven. Psalm 107:30 tells us; they come into trouble on the way, but those in them look to God, and He brings them to their desired haven. I think Peter is like that. He says, "for thus shall the entrance into the everlasting kingdom of
{375}
our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ be richly furnished unto you", @2 Peter 1:11. This was true of himself. He was about to put off his tabernacle in triumphant martyrdom, and he is full of the glory. He is like a ship going into port under full sail. The disciples were instructed in houses, but they received important instruction in ships, too. There is considerable reference to that in the gospels; it is as if the saints are viewed as on a troubled sea, with constant storms arising: how are we making the passage? It is a question of the power *in* us, and of the guidance furnished to us; "for thus shall the entrance into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ be richly furnished unto you (@2 Peter 1:11)".
Ships are typical; sometimes they represent the Jewish system, but in other cases they represent what the Lord *uses --* He came into their ship, and when He did so the disciples got to land, @John 6:21.
W.B-w. You referred to Peter's coming to Lydda. The next locality, or meeting, was Joppa; death had come in there; Dorcas had died. Through Peter she was raised and presented *living* . Revival was brought about in a locality where there had been death and sorrow. Do you think there would be something special in that locality?
J.T. I think so; the two points established would be that, on the one hand, brothers would be able to do something for themselves, without having to send out to brethren from other meetings; and secondly, there would be a *living* state of things developed, for when Peter raised Dorcas, he presented her "living", as we have noted. The idea would be that life, in character, is now there.
As we were saying, he supports Paul in calling attention to what these saints were. He says in chapter 2, "To whom coming, a living stone, cast away indeed as worthless by men, but with God chosen, precious,
{376}
yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ", @1 Peter 2:4,5. That is what they were; that is Paul's line; that they were in their *own* towns as living stones, and being also priests were offering spiritual sacrifices to God through Jesus Christ. Instead of the dead religious services in the temple at Jerusalem and among the Jews generally, these believers in Christ, though dispersed, were occupied in the service of God in a holy, intelligent, and living way.
W.B-w. Would paralysis coming in at Lydda, and death at Joppa, be God's governmental dealings in some way in those meetings?
J.T. Well, I think so; to bring out what the meeting should be. If paralysed, they may have to send to other places for help; but as healed, *they* are able to do what is needed. And then, secondly, in place of death, life is brought in. Thus we have a living state of things marked by intelligent activity.
W.B-w. If two or three do everything, it would tend to paralysis in a meeting. Should not all be taken into matters?
J.T. Yes. I think a great point is to bring in all the saints. Paul makes that a point in regard to business matters; the one who is least esteemed in the assembly is to adjudicate, showing that each is to have his place in what relates to the assembly. If "the least of the saints", I shall not belittle or ignore any of them.
W.R. I was wondering whether that would not be the spirit of shepherding in a locality: "shepherd the flock of God which is among you, exercising oversight, not by necessity, but willingly", @1 Peter 5:2. It is really to bring out all the wealth that is there in a locality.
J.T. Yes: "shepherd the flock of God which is among you". It is a local position; elders are always viewed as being local.
{377}
THE SISTERHOOD IN RELATION TO MARRIAGE
@Genesis 22:20 - 23; @Genesis 24:1 - 9
One is reminded of the parable in @Matthew 22:2 "The kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who made a wedding feast for his son". This would go beyond the principals, for it is not simply a marriage, but a *marriage feast* , affording something for *each guest* . The parable conveys a wide thought, for the occasion of a marriage should be unselfishly and generously employed in making the happiness radiate to as wide an extent as possible; and in a marriage feast there is nothing worth radiating or extending, save what is characteristic of those who are believers in the Lord Jesus. What belongs to mere nature is not worth passing on. What is of the Spirit is to be extended; that is of vital value. All else perishes; even the very best joys of nature are perishing; not to be despised in their place, of course, but it is well to have a right appraisement of everything.
The marriage feast of @Matthew 22 was made by a great personage -- a king, for it is a question of God and Christ and the assembly. It was God who conceived the thought of this wedding feast. The great heart of God would take occasion to *extend* the spiritual felicity of such a time; in fact it was a matter of extending grace. There were those who spurned it, but there were those who did not, and shared in the holy joy of the occasion. I would remark that, save as we share in the holy joy of the wedding feast that God has made for Christ, we shall not rightly enjoy a wedding feast of this kind. It is patterned on that, for we are here in relation to what is spiritual. We should not come together merely to share the natural; while we fully value it and respect it,
{378}
we come here in goodly numbers for more than that; at least, one would hope so. It is in what is spiritual that God has His part; He loves to share in our spiritual feasts. He ever takes advantage of an opportunity to take part in such occasions. He would extend and promote joy in the Holy Spirit. One of the greatest things in this world of sorrow is joy in the Holy Spirit. All else is evanescent, but joy in the Holy Spirit is a permanent thing, and God would have us share in it.
The king in preparing this feast was really acting on family lines. It was not for a subject, but for his son. A glorious thought! It connects with Abraham in that way, for it is a family idea; and we have part in it as Christians. The king looks for his guests to be attired in wedding garments, such as are suitable for a holy, spiritual occasion. Let us not forget that. God comes in to see the guests, to see what kind of garments we have on, whether they are merely in relation to the natural or, as they should be, wholly related to the spiritual. No garment that is unspiritual will please His eye. The king came in to see the guests, and one had not on a wedding garment. He took notice of that. Very solemn!
The book of Genesis affords a remarkable field for instruction as to this matter. Abraham, as you might say, is the centre of the book from the patriarchal side, although there were others, of course, such as Noah, who "prepared an ark for the saving of his house (@Hebrews 11:7)". He was not behind in his day. Although his sons were all married, he provided for them. They came under his wing, and the daughters-in-law as well, which serves to show what I am saying as to the great paternal thought of Genesis. The three families of Noah came in under one head. He prepared an ark for the saving of his house. It was what the house *needed* . As we have said, God Himself led in this. He thought of Adam and said, "It is not good that Man should be alone", (@Genesis 2:18). The paternal idea is seen there, for Adam, we
{379}
might say, was a son of God. Luke says he was "of God"; God had breathed into him. Parents are therefore to be considerate, and every father is to develop the paternal thought, if he is to promote family feelings and affections. The divine thought is that these should be handed down. One of the greatest heritages is right family feelings and affections. So God said it was not good for Adam that he should be alone, but He immediately proposes to provide for that need. He would make him one suitable, "a helpmate, his like (@Genesis 2:18)". And Abraham had a corresponding thought as to Isaac, that he should have a suitable wife. One of the important thoughts in Genesis is the sisterhood among the saints.
As one looks round in the circle of the saints, it is gratifying to see godly sisters, young and old. There is the brotherhood, but to balance that there must be the sisterhood. It did not exist in @Genesis 2, when God thought for Adam: the sisterhood did not then exist. God says in principle, I will provide it. He *built* the woman, we are told -- a remarkable word. She is not viewed as a generation; she is a creation, but a creation on the ground and principle of being built, implying, I suppose, symmetry; that is, there is correspondence according to divine design; she is suitable for Adam. It is very remarkable that God should take such pains. The word is not used in relation to any creature save the woman, and it is with man in view; that the wife should be in every way according to what was needed. Adam was a wonderful creature, and no one knew that better than God, for he was His own supreme handiwork and so is his wife, too, but she is *builded*  in relation to Adam. God says, I will provide him one, his like. And then we have this structural word, "builded". It is a matter of what she is -- made to order, so to speak. God ordered her in His own mind, and designed and builded her accordingly.
Well, all this is important for the sisters: the thought
{380}
of being built should search our hearts, for it excludes *will*, and will in woman is peculiarly strong, and would easily interfere with the design. The thought runs down; it cannot be with Eve only. The sisterhood must be in accord with the need. What was the need? The need was in the brotherhood. Adam was first formed, and then Eve, we are told; but the moral defect appeared first in Eve; she was in the transgression. It is a very solemn reminder, showing how feminine character lends itself to the enemy and spoils the divine plan. As soon as the enemy is admitted, the divine plan is spoiled.
Well now, the paternal thought comes down, as I said, and appears in Abraham. He had been wonderfully honoured, but now in chapter 22, the true thought of a man shines: man as a father, for it is in that way that a man should shine; as a husband too, and Abraham shone as a husband; but as a father, he shines in this chapter; a man fully obedient as to God. He acceded to the will of God under great pain, we must understand, but he fulfilled the divine requirement, "Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, Isaac", (@Genesis 22:2). It is a demand on his keenest affections. Is God not worthy of such a sacrifice -- of such an exhibition of true manhood under His eye? That true womanhood should come to light there, is what might be expected, and that is just what *does* come to light, for Rebecca and her genealogy are immediately introduced, representing the sisterhood coming down from the family of Terah. It is Abraham's own family line that is brought to our attention, for he and Isaac through him, also sprang from Terah.
Now Abraham has Isaac on the principle of resurrection -- the heavenly man -- for Isaac is not said to have come down from the mountain. Abraham and the servants went to Beer-sheba, but nothing is said of Isaac being with them, as if his place is above, so he is
{381}
peculiarly the heavenly man henceforth. That is what the type conveys here. Then the Spirit of God brings the woman into evidence; it is the sister; and, dear brethren, this is one of the most important bits of instruction for the moment, because there are so many with us who are young. We can thank God for them all. There is nothing more pleasing to God's eye than to see the young coming forward spiritually, not only taking their place in fellowship, but taking on what enters into it, in a spiritual way. That is what the sisterhood, as descended from Terah would mean - a spiritual family on the feminine side; that is the idea. So we have these eight whom Milcah bore to Abraham's brother Nahor; a remarkable family from a spiritual point of view, but from one of them, Bethuel, comes Rebecca, the one who is specially in mind. She is the one whom the Spirit of God has in His mind at this point; and, as we have seen, Isaac is already presented according to what he was typically. This chapter establishes him in the mind of faith, and now we have the woman, and she is established in our minds as of the right family, that is, of the same family as himself. Thus we have here in type, Christ and the assembly.
Bringing this into the present occasion, young people are instructed that the sisterhood must correspond with the brotherhood; that in entering into the marriage relation, the sister must correspond with the brother. That is the divine mind. Anything contrary to this great thought is detrimental to the testimony, as we see in Esau later, for his wives were a source of grief to this spiritual woman, Rebecca. The linking on of unconverted persons or merely nominal Christians with believing sons and daughters of spiritual persons, is an abomination to heaven. It makes for the ruin of the testimony wherever it prevails. The Spirit of God is contending against it constantly, and other worldly associations, also, indeed against all worldly things,
{382}
such as radio, current worldly literature, and the like. The Spirit of God is battling with these things all over the world day and night, to preserve the testimony from their terrible influence, and these scriptures are to help us see the kind of brotherhood and the kind of sisterhood that are to be in mind as new households are contemplated. Isaac is the brother, and a type of Christ; Rebecca is the sister, and a type of the assembly. She is of the right family; she has come down from the same family as Abraham, so the word in the New Testament is, "she is free to be married to whom she will, only in the Lord", (@1 Corinthians 7:39). The word is "only in the Lord" -- you might say. Why does it not say, Only a child of God? The point is that in these matters it is the natural *will* that has to be dealt with -- the will of the young person. "In the Lord" means that the natural will is superseded; that my will is not in it. It is the will of God. The authority of God is vested in the Lord Jesus, and hence marriage "in the Lord" implies that the will of God prevails, and not the natural wills of those entering into this relation.
Having made these remarks, I now call attention to Abraham, and his great fatherly concern as to his son Isaac, as to the kind of wife he is to have. What I have been saying keeps the thought in our minds that the wife is already existent; a suitable one. She is somewhere, and Abraham is concerned that she should be *found* ; and if not found, no one else will do. He says, "And if the woman be not willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be quit of this my oath" -- that is, *she* determines the matter. If her will is against the truth, then the servant is cleared, but there is no wife for Isaac, and Isaac will be without one; there is no other. Isaac will be better without one than with one who will damage him for the testimony. So Abraham is concerned about this, and he causes his servant to swear as to it. That is to be observed. What is on the face of this
{383}
passage is the fatherly affection and deep concern of Abraham for Isaac, that he should have a suitable companion, and it is obvious that the same exercise should enter into a moment like this. We have here parents on both sides, true sons and daughters of Abraham, thank God, so that our dear brother and sister are well set out. Both have descended from right families, and the parental feelings to which I have alluded, exist. The wedding feast made by the king for his son, is reflected here; this is seen in what is provided for us here today; but then the thought now is that this parental principle should go down; that it should pass on. It is one of the greatest heritages that we have, the principles we have spoken of properly cherished and exercised in one generation, handed on to the next, all originating in God.
There is, alas! a parentage that originates with the devil, @John 8:44 -- it is not so here today, thank God! We have the right parents, and our young brother and sister are to cherish the principles in which they have been tutored, and in turn hand them down. It will be exercised in a variety of ways. It enters into the household, into entertainment of the saints, into hospitality generally, and into many other relations and circumstances. It is really, dear brethren, what enters into the revelation which we enjoy, of what and how the Father thinks of the Son. John says, "we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father", @John 1:14. It was how the Lord Jesus acted towards His Father, and so it is that as the parental thought is taken on, the son knows how to act towards his father. Solomon said, "For I was a son unto my father, tender and an only one in the sight of my mother", @Proverbs 4:3. Proverbs becomes the most useful book for all young people.
So these thoughts I would commit to our dear brother and sister in their new path. They are to adorn it; they are to add to it throughout.
{384}
THE LORD'S COMING (6)
@2 Peter 1:16 - 21, @2 Peter 3:1 - 18; @Jude 14,15,20 - 25; @1 John 3:2,3
J.T. At our last reading we considered 1 Peter, in which the government of God is stressed, and "the revelation of Jesus Christ (@1 Peter 1:7)" is brought in, in connection with it. Now we have Peter's second epistle before us, and what is of importance, negatively, is that it deals with *sin* as such, accounting for the ecclesiastical, social, and general working of sin in the modern world. Jude treats of sin, too, but in the character of apostasy; that is another side of the truth strongly linked up with the coming of the Lord. John's first epistle treats of life, but the verses read direct our view to what we are to be. We are *now* the children of God - wonderful witness to the Father's love for us; what we *shall* be is not yet manifested; when it is manifested "we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is (@1 John 3:2)". So that John gives us an outlet to eternal things -- what we are to be -- a matter of the greatest importance in a positive sense.
Our first scripture refers to the incident on the Mount of Transfiguration, called here "the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ", verse 16. It is intended to throw light upon the whole prophetic testimony, so that an immense range of thought is open to us, for the apostle says, "we have the prophetic word made surer, to which ye do well taking heed (as to a lamp shining in an obscure place) until the day dawn and the morning star arise in your hearts; knowing this first, that the scope of no prophecy of scripture is had from its own particular interpretation, for prophecy was not ever uttered by the will of man, but holy men of God spake under the power of the Holy Spirit",
{385}
verses 19 - 21. So that our scripture opens up an immense scope of truth; "the *power* and *coming* of our Lord Jesus Christ" -- what He was as seen on the holy mountain, and what the heavenly saints are as with Him -- and then the whole scope of prophecy is enlightened for us.
A.R.S. I suppose the morning star Peter speaks about is the same as the morning star in @Revelation 22:16, and is connected with the coming of the Lord.
J.T. Yes; the allusion is to Christ known privately before He shines out as the Sun, when all shall see Him; it is how He is apprehended by the saints -- the assembly -- as coming for us, touching on the idea of the rapture; the star arises in our hearts.
C.A.M. Is this Matthew's view of the Mount of Transfiguration -- the Lord's face shining as the sun? You said that scene threw light on the whole range of prophecy.
J.T. Yes. That is how Peter presents it here -- "we have the prophetic word made surer". It is confirmed and established for the saints, through that testimony, "the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ". It is made surer; which would mean that it is made surer in our souls. There are "two unchangeable things, in which it was impossible that God should lie, we might have a strong encouragement", (@Hebrews 6:18); the Mount of Transfiguration is like that; it is a confirmatory thing for us.
C.A.M. The fact that it became so wonderfully great in Peter's soul -- so much greater to him than it was when he first saw it -- should be an encouragement to us, should it not?
J.T. It should be an encouragement as indicating progression in the truth, which should mark us. The whole epistle has in mind that we should progress in the truth, having it made surer. The prophets -- Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and the minor prophets -- are
{386}
all therefore opened up as an immense field of inquiry. The exercised saints of a century ago began with that side of the truth, inquiring into the prophetic map The power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, witnessed on the Mount of Transfiguration, sheds light on it for us.
A.P.T. Peter's quotation in this passage coincides with Matthew's gospel. Is there any significance in that?
J.T. Well, of course. Peter speaks here as an eye-witness; but what he says agrees with Matthew's account. Matthew enlarges on Peter in the section of his gospel with which Peter links on here, i.e. chapters 16 and 17. This is the only reference we get in Peter's ministry to this wonderful event. It would enter into the assembly's position, Matthew also having that in mind.
F.H.L. The glory speaking to Him would be in testimony. The words are addressed to the Lord Himself, but in testimony to others.
J.T. While the word "this" implies testimony to others, the "voice" is uttered to Christ. "He received from God the Father honour and glory, such a voice being uttered to him by the excellent glory", verse 17. It is the glory, as it were, speaking -- a remarkable way of putting the truth; like "in him all the fulness (of the Godhead) was pleased to dwell", (@Colossians 1:19); that is the Deity, but in the term *fulness* , which has an active sense. And so, "the greatness in the heavens", (@Hebrews 8:1), is to convey to our souls the greatness of the Deity in so far as it is comprehensible by us in the expressions used.
A.N.W. Would you say a word more on the use of the word *coming* in regard to the Mount? The conversation with Moses and Elias was in regard to His departure, but the Lord spoke of His coming: "the Son of man coming in his kingdom", (@Matthew 16:28).
{387}
J.T. I suppose attention is called to the movement in it. It says: "There are some of those standing here that shall not taste of death at all until they shall have seen the Son of man coming in his kingdom (@Matthew 16:28)". The movement involved is majestic in Matthew; it is the majesty of the King. But the two men in white at the Mount of Olives in @Acts 1:11 say, "This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall thus come in the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven". The manner of His going is noted. This enters into our position now; the manner or way of His coming in and going out among us. We have in @Proverbs 30:29 certain creatures that "are comely in going",. The Lord is supreme in that. Think of how He came in and went out amongst the disciples! But this wonderful scene on the Mount is a testimony to His coming royal glory as in Matthew; it is the Son of man coming in His kingdom. So that His face is like the sun; it is majestic in rule.
J.T.Jr. Is there a link with the thought of the coming of the Lord as dealing with the man of sin, whom He "shall annul by the appearing of his coming", (@2 Thessalonians 2:8)? Is that suggestion also found in the scene depicted on the Mount of Transfiguration?
J.T. Yes. What is stressed in 2 Thessalonians is the *appearing --* some peculiar effect in the appearing of His coming. There is something very much against evil in it. So that it is those who love His appearing that are especially honoured. But the *coming* is also in the passage.
J.T.Jr. The word "annul" is striking. The glory that is connected with the man of sin is completely blotted out, you might say, by the glory of Christ.
J.S. Is the shining as the sun, referred to in Matthew, connected with the outshining of glory?
J.T. I think it is in the sense of majesty and rule. Matthew gives a very full account of the transfiguration. He stresses the majesty of Christ.
{388}
J.S. The outshining of His glory in His *face* .
J.T. Exactly; the sun represents rule.
W.R. Glory in that sense is stressed in Matthew's gospel. In @Matthew 24:27,30 it says, "for as the lightning goes forth from the east and shines to the west, so shall be the coming of the Son of man", and then again: "they shall see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory".
J.T. And in chapter 25, He sits down "upon his throne of glory" to rule the nations, @Matthew 25:31; Matthew's viewpoint is majesty in view of government. It is a very great thing to have before us, because we are now made aware of an immensity of human and material power in the world; but we must contemplate what Christ will have as He appears in rule.
J.S. And does Matthew present Him as the Son of man in connection with universal rule?
J.T. That is right; Matthew usually enlarges the truth beyond Judaism, he is not honouring Judaism. The title "Son of man" is universal.
W.B-w. Would these "cleverly imagined fables" of verse 16 be in opposition to this truth?
J.T. Exactly; it is what Judaism was at that time; what it had become. It is carried over and greatly amplified in Christendom, including cleverly imagined fables. The Lord constantly repelled Judaism, because of what it had become through human tradition, and now Peter is carrying that forward, because it was about to take shape in the Christian profession. It has occurred to me lately that the mystery of iniquity is really Judaism developing in Christianity; Satan transferring the judaising spirit and principle into Christianity. The epistle to the Galatians deals with this; it has taken on enormous proportions, inclusive of old pagan customs. It entered in a comparatively small way, but now it has expanded into royalty -- certain leading ones
{389}
reigning as kings. This was appearing in Corinth. It is a question of how the mystery of iniquity began; it is the work of Satan from the earliest days -- paganism introduced amongst Christians; but Judaism furnished the occasion of it.
W.B-w. The light of the Lord's coming, through prophetic ministry, exposes that sort of thing.
A.N.W. John, in his epistle, deals with the Christ and the antichrist, as well as the Father and the Son.
J.T. We have reference to the Father and the Son here, and the immensity of the glory; but glory in relation to affection. It is the "excellent glory" speaking to Christ as Son on the mount, but of course it is the Father; so that it is an immensity of glory and power, the Father's love entering into the speaking; it is His love for the Son. So that we are brought into Christianity, you might say in its fullest sense, in this wonderful opening up of the truth of the Mount of Transfiguration.
T.H. Paul sent Timothy to Corinth in view of his own coming; he says, "I will come quickly to you", (@1 Corinthians 4:19). Does that correspond with what is before us as to the Lord's coming?
J.T. It was that the apostle, in his ways as they were in Christ, should be represented amongst the Corinthians in such a man as Timothy. Correspondingly, the Lord would now have His spirit developed in us in view of His coming.
C.A.M. Has God allowed the mystery of iniquity to increase to such proportions, instead of dealing with it, that His greatness in His final dealing with it may be magnified?
J.T. I think that is a side of the truth that we have, perhaps, hardly touched yet; why God allows sin to develop in this way; why He did not crush it at the beginning. It already works, the apostle says, with no suggestion of it having been overcome in the meantime. God would allow sin to develop in relation to Christianity.
{390}
It was allowed to develop in the human race before the flood; then after the flood; then in Israel, and now in Christendom.
C.A.M. I suppose God uses the enormity of sin, coming into our consciences, to impress us with how mighty He is in being able to deal with it.
J.T. That is right; "that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful", (@Romans 7:13). Why should God allow sin to become exceeding sinful? He permits us to see it in its exceeding sinfulness, and judge it accordingly. I think it takes most of us a life-time to judge it, and the Spirit sustains us in the judgment of it; that is, sin in ourselves. But as to the *external* working of sin, the man of sin is to be the fulness of it. We might ask. Why is God allowing all this? It is His way; He will bring sin out according to what it really is; and the man of sin, when he appears, will be the living exponent of it, so that God might deal with it at once and forever in that man.
J.S. Is it in order to make His power and wisdom known, as we see in Pharaoh being raised up in Egypt?
J.T. Just so; "for this very cause have I raised thee up, to shew thee my power; and that my name may be declared in all the earth", (@Exodus 9:16). This has in view God's power in dealing with sin; what He has done in the cross of Jesus; what He is doing in our souls now, and what He will do in its full and universal development in the man of sin presently. We are on the very fringe of this development and we should judge present events accordingly; and this wonderful display on the Mount of Transfiguration is to illuminate our souls as to the whole prophetic ministry of the Old and New Testament that we may see how the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ enters into it; consideration of it *confirms* us.
W.B-w. It is called "the holy mountain" here; I suppose that would be in contrast to sin, would it not?
{391}
The more we understand divine holiness, the more we abhor sin and judge it.
J.T. Quite so.
A.P.T. Would it seem that Peter is particularly qualified to touch this line, inasmuch as he had said to the Lord, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord", (@Luke 5:8)?
J.T. Yes; we should note how God allowed sin to show itself in *him* later. He was certainly qualified to take up this matter, and as we proceed to chapter 3, we shall see how the question of sin is dealt with by him in this epistle.
A.R. In chapter 2, angels are bound in chains, for judgment in the day to come, whereas it would appear that Satan is allowed to go to and fro through the earth. God gives him, in measure, a free hand, does He not?
J.T. That is, I think, to bring out this matter of which we are speaking; the full development of sin; and to show that what is in the saints is according to what is in Christ. The Lord had said, "for the ruler of the world comes, and in me he has nothing", (@John 14:30). There is nothing in Christ to respond to him at all. John's ministry would teach us to take account of ourselves abstractly, and so Satan has nothing in *us* , from that abstract point of view, for "every one begotten of God does not sin", (@1 John 5:18). It is an immense leverage in the soul, to reach that point; the believer is thus immune, in measure, as Christ was; but then we are in a mixed condition, and that is where sin comes in amongst us, and is allowed scope in us. Romans takes up that side of the truth, basing the teaching in this respect on what we are *de facto* here. Chapter 7 contemplates sin in the believer, but God gives us power to resist it, to overcome it in ourselves; and I believe God orders conditions so that this might be worked out in us. John teaches us that what is in Christ is in us, and it stands against the wiles of the devil, but Romans
{392}
teaches us how evil, owned to be in us, is overcome: "So then *I myself* with the mind serve God's law", @Romans 7:25. That is the basis of it, and the Spirit in us maintains us in this resolution; hence the victory!
A.R. So that it says in @Romans 16:20, "the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly",.
J.T. The word "shortly", as used in that verse, would show that our deliverance is a progressive thing. The Lord was led into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil, to bring out what He was, and what was in Satan too. He became an exposed and defeated foe.
A.B.P. Would @1 Corinthians 5 suggest that heaven makes use of Satan in dealing with gross evil?
J.T. He is used as an instrument. The wicked person, "being such", is delivered to Satan for the destruction of the flesh; Satan is compelled to do that.
A.B.P. It is said that God tempts no one, @James 1:13. If we allow sin to remain unjudged in us, does God permit Satan to get at us, so that we might eventually humble ourselves?
J.T. Yes; as we see in Job's case. The book of Job enlightens us in a special way as to that.
J.S. Is liberty allowed to Satan for the destruction of the flesh?
J.T. Quite so; Satan charged God with having hedged Job around and he could not get at him, but God allows him to touch him, and this brings out that Satan had misjudged Job.
A.N.W. So that Satan would ever have access to us, as the flesh is unjudged; God would allow him to have access to us in that measure?
J.T. Quite so. And then, moreover, if God allows this, it brings out what we are, so that the apostle Paul says: "there was given to me a thorn for the flesh, a messenger of Satan that he might buffet me", (@2 Corinthians 12:7). It was not because of what was acting in Paul
{393}
at the moment, but what *might* be; "buffet me, that I might not be exalted (@2 Corinthians 12:7)". So that Satan is used as an instrument to save Paul from damage.
J.S. That would keep him balanced.
J.T. Quite so. He says, "For this I thrice besought the Lord that it might depart from me", but the Lord said, "My grace suffices thee", (@2 Corinthians 12:8,9). The balance was necessary; the Lord did not remove it. And the apostle said, "Most gladly therefore will I rather boast in my weaknesses, that the power of the Christ may dwell upon me(@2 Corinthians 12:9)".
A.N.W. The Lord said, "Satan has demanded to have you, to sift you as wheat; but *I* have besought for thee", (@Luke 22:31,32). Where would you see Satan's hand coming to light in Peter's fall?
J.T. I think it was in warming himself with the officers; in not holding himself aloof. He joined himself, outwardly at least, with the persecutors of Christ; he was sharing what they had, and it was *there* he was attacked by the devil.
J.S. Would the fact that he was warming himself indicate he was at some moral distance -- in the cold?
J.T. That is right; had he been entirely with the Lord in heart, he would not have been in that position. The Lord said, *"I* have besought for thee (@Luke 22:32)". Satan had demanded not only Peter, but the twelve, I apprehend; but the word to Peter, *"I* have besought for thee that thy faith fail not (@Luke 22:32)", would show that the Lord meant he was to be tested that way.
A.A.T. I suppose Judas fell into the hands of Satan, having no faith.
J.T. He was "the son of perdition" (@John 17:12); it was a matter of the fulfilment of scripture. The question often arises as to why he was selected. Evidently it was that sin, working in a man in *those circumstances* , might come to light. It is one of the remarkable instances of how God orders in this respect; He would show the sin of Judas
{394}
in its enormity. Here is a man accompanying the Lord as the other apostles did, and actually using the same power; having thus the greatest advantages during those years of service, and here is the result; it is the incorrigibleness of the flesh, brought to light under such circumstances. We are greatly privileged now, in having part in the assembly, but Satan may get at us notwithstanding. The nearer we are to Christ, the more he wishes to get at us and damage us.
J.S. It is encouraging that the work of God in us is immune; he could not overthrow that.
J.T. It is on that line that John's epistles help us. Such privileges as Peter and Judas and the other disciples had might be regarded as preventing satanic attacks, but the facts show that he got at them, and one is shown to be the son of perdition. He is the only one that is called that, except the "man of sin". The man of sin represents the same thing, only developing largely out of Christendom. Christianity, of course, implied nearness to Christ -- "part with me" -- nevertheless the man of sin is, in a sense, the outcome of Christianity in its public history, so that he also is called "the son of perdition (@2 Thessalonians 2:3)".
A.R. You mean what is seen in Judas is transferred to the antichrist?
J.T. Exactly. The mystery of iniquity is transferred and worked out in what is part of the public profession, but the profession involved, in the beginning, the greatest and most blessed privileges.
J.S. Would the man of sin be the full-blown product of the working of iniquity?
J.T. I think so. The history of Christianity publicly is the background of it; the mystery of iniquity has taken form in the public assembly.
A.N.W. Satan could only be the evil being he is by having been near God.
J.T. He was "the anointed covering cherub"(@Ezekiel 28:14); he
{395}
had thus a place near to God. He was on "the holy mountain of God", (@Ezekiel 28:14). Jude speaks of persons coming in unawares; that is, they are Satan's emissaries, who enter the Christian sphere with a view to attack. John sees them *going out* ; he says, "They went out from among us, but they were not of us", @1 John 2:19. They had come in to corrupt the Christian body, which they did, and the man of sin is the outcome of that. He "sits down in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God", (@2 Thessalonians 2:4). It is largely because he has known Christianity; that is, it is known in the system out of which his principles develop.
C.A.M. Referring again to Peter and to his qualifications to speak: the matter of his sin and the way Satan especially singled him out, and the answer to the Lord's prayer, all show why Peter was so qualified to pronounce on the case of Judas in @Acts 1, and also the antichristian elements here. He really was a most triumphant man with regard to it all.
J.T. Quite so. You mean he had judged sin in these forms. The facts given as to Peter's sin and recovery show that he became, through the experience, more qualified for his great mission.
W.R. The apostle Paul had also to contend with these very principles. Are not Hymenaeus and Philetus examples? They were bringing in evil doctrine.
W.B-w. In the days of Ezra and Nehemiah, Sanballat and Tobijah made an alliance with Eliashib the high priest, to corrupt what there was of God inside. Would that correspond with the mystery of iniquity?
J.T. Just so; it indicates how Satan works in this respect.
A.N.W. John says that when Judas went out, "it was night", @John 13:30. That is the night, as was never before -- the night of apostasy.
T.V.H. Does the parable of the talents apply to Peter and Judas, or is Judas not considered a bondman?
{396}
J.T. Judas is not one of those *left* ; the bondmen in the parable are persons left in the absence of Christ, and you cannot include Judas there. The state described in the bondman who received the one talent is very low, because he confessed that he did not know the Lord, but thought Him to be a hard man, showing he did not know Him.
Now, having touched on this matter of sin in chapter 2, we see materialism in chapter 3 of this epistle. We should note, however, that in Peter it is the angels who had *sinned* ; not those who left their original estate, which is apostasy, as in Jude. It is sin that is in mind here, and Peter enlarges upon the working of sin; it covers what is around us -- the seething iniquity in high places; it is in every phase of the profession; it is seething iniquity. That is contemplated in chapter 2. In chapter 3 the apostle contemplates *materialism* ; that is, the mockers, "walking according to their own lusts, and saying. Where is the promise of his coming? For from the time the fathers fell asleep all things remain thus from the beginning of the creation. For this is hidden from them through their own wilfulness, that heavens were of old, and an earth, having its subsistence out of water and in water, by the word of God, through which waters the then world, deluged with water, perished. But the present heavens and the earth by his word are laid up in store, kept for fire unto a day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men", verses 4 - 7. It should be borne in mind in contemplating this chapter that these mockers are walking after their own lusts, and they want to carry on their lustful conduct; also that, in principle, materialism is involved in modernism. Modernism is distinctively materialistic, but the instigators and propagators of it are walking after their own lusts. Lust is covered up by this material teaching; they are saying there is no change. They are covering up evil, and therefore the apostle begins by
{397}
saying he would "stir up, in the way of putting you in remembrance, your pure mind", verse 1. The moral basis for understanding this epistle is having a pure mind.
J.T.Jr. The thought of walking after lusts appears in both chapters 2 and 3. It would seem that in chapter 2 it is the despising of lordship -- the authority of Christ denied -- and the same lust and walk denies His coming in chapter 3.
J.T. And they bring in materialism to prove their point. Their wills are brought into the thing. Lusts are at the bottom of the great general movement involving materialism, extending many years back. Men will carry on with this materialism and modernism to cover up the moral element beneath.
J.T.Jr. Whatever differences there may be in modern religion in the world, this lust is the same. It is the same also if it works amongst the saints.
W.B-w. In the second chapter we get the old world, out of which Noah was saved; then Sodom, out of which Lot was delivered, but when we come to the principle seen in Balaam, there does not seem to be anyone saved.
J.T. He represents the religious system we are speaking about; in it there is "the doctrine of Balaam", (@Revelation 2:14).
W.B-w. You see persons saved out of Sodom, but this other condition seems to have no hope.
J.T. "I gave her time that she should repent, and she will not repent", (@Revelation 2:21).
W.B-w. That would be the system of iniquity in Thyatira.
J.T. Yes. "Great Babylon has fallen, has fallen, and has become the habitation of demons, and a hold of every unclean spirit, and a hold of every unclean and hated bird", (@Revelation 18:2). That is judicial.
J.T.Jr. The evil is spoken of as slavery of corruption,
{398}
in chapter 2. It seems to be brought under domination, so that there is no way out.
W.B-w. Who is represented in the mockers in chapter 3?
J.T. I think they are such as would legalise the world, corrupt as it is now, and say. We must go on with things as they are. One is struck with that word, "knowing this first, that there shall come at the close of the days mockers with mocking, walking according to their own lusts, and saying ..." It is their *walk* first; then their saying. So that their teaching would cover up their lusts.
J.S. They have before them their own gratification.
J.T. Quite so. I am struck with that thought: they are *walking* after their own lusts, and *saying* something. But what they say is to be weighed in relation to their walk. So that if a man is saying anything, in this doctrinal sense, you have to get at his conduct and his general history. These will determine whether you can listen to what he is saying.
W.B-w. They are denying the coming of the Lord and the truth generally.
J.T. They are not openly saying there is no such thing as the coming of the Lord, but they are discrediting the truth, like the sons of the prophets who said to Elisha that they had fifty strong men and would go and see if they could find Elijah, @2 Kings 2:16. It is the same general idea; they had in mind to find him physically. Here, they are talking about materialism. What is called *evolution* is materialism; it is not something out of nothing; it is something out of something. So that it is not creation at all. All the sciences enter into this matter; not only are the heavens referred to, but the earth as well, and the first thing the apostle brings in is the judgment of "the world that then was", and he stresses *the word of God* . That is the thing for us to lay hold of. It is "by the word of God" in both cases-the world that perished and the present one, verses 5 - 7.
{399}
J.S. And judicial blindness is brought in here, because of their own wilfulness; "this is hidden from them through their own wilfulness".
J.T. *Will* is working; they will resist whatever you say to them, and they will go to all pains to set aside the truth, to carry out their own will. It is bad enough to walk in lust, but to cover it up with will is more serious. And it is most specious, for it is worked out in the way of teaching.
R.S. And so @2 Timothy 3:7 speaks of the last times -- those who are "always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth".
J.T. That is another class, similar to this, but pretending to learn. Modernists are not learning from the Bible; they are bringing in their own thoughts; their wills are in it, and they are covering up everything with materialistic doctrines; things that appeal to the natural mind. But in verse 8, the apostle says, "But let not this one thing be hidden from you, beloved". *We* are to see things. If our wills are at work we will not. Love marks true Christian teaching; Peter calls the saints "beloved". The apostle loved the brethren.
A.B.P. Has Peter earlier fortified the minds of the saints against these voices, by his reference to the voice from heaven in the previous chapter?
J.T. Quite so. Hence the temerity of these modernists in doing all they can to discredit the books of the Bible, beginning with Genesis; whereas the Lord, the One upon whom the heavens were opened, went back to Genesis; "Having begun from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself", (@Luke 24:27). That is the one that is under the eye of God for His pleasure. These men are discrediting all that.
F.H.L. What is included in the commandment of our Lord and Saviour?
J.T. It is the idea of authority in the teaching,
{400}
stressing divine authority as over against the doctrine of these men. They are basing everything on materialism. That is, they say that things have not changed since the times of the fathers. It is a Jewish reference, of course, whereas the Lord Jesus with His apostles brought in a new order of things altogether, and it is a *faith* matter. The dispensation of God is in faith, @1 Timothy 1:4. It is also a spiritual matter; but the idea of authority is stressed in it; our salvation depends upon submitting to divine authority. The evil men contemplated in this epistle "despise lordship"; they "do not fear speaking injuriously of dignities", @2 Peter 2:10. But true believers obey: "He that has my commandments and keeps them, *he* it is that loves me", (@John 14:21), and, "If any one love me, he will keep my word", (@John 14:23). The reference to love for Christ in those Peter addresses is very beautiful. "Whom, having not seen, ye love", @1 Peter 1:8. The secret of loving His appearing is that I love *Him* .
A.R. Is that why he speaks in the end of this chapter about the day of the Lord? He does not seem to stir u their pure minds in regard to the rapture, but rather to look for the day of the Lord. Why is that?
J.T. It is over against the doctrines of the mockers. The apostle is stressing the judgment of the first world, and also that the world that now is -- the present heavens and earth -- is reserved for fire, unto a day of judgment of ungodly men. He keeps that in mind. What they are dealing with, and founding everything on, is to be destroyed *with themselves* . Over against all that, the day of the Lord will come as a thief. Connected with it is the day of God, verse 12. It is the Creator. They talk about the creation, but the Creator is coming in, and hence the day of God; it is the Creator's day, and it leads us into eternity. He is not going on for ever with the present order of things, of which the scoffers were making so much. It is to be destroyed! There will be
{401}
a new heaven and a new earth. Where will the scoffers be then? On what will they found their doctrines then?
C.A.M. If we come to a judgment in our souls as to what the first world, destroyed by water, was, perhaps suggested in John the baptist's ministry -- we would not have to be destroyed by fire. I suppose this generation you are speaking of is the same, in principle, as that generation of vipers, which John denounced?
J.T. Quite so. So that Peter speaks of being saved by water. Paul says there are certain who will be saved so as by fire. That is, they will be saved as through fire, but their works will be burnt up. Here it is the judgment of ungodly men who are to be destroyed with the present heavens and earth.
J.S. Judgment by fire is cleansing.
J.T. Yes. There is nothing so drastic as cleansing through fire. We ought to keep in mind these two material worlds, both maintained or destroyed on the principle of the word of God, that is the idea of our position. We are linked up through faith with the world that God has before Him; a new heavens and a new earth wherein dwells righteousness. Faith lay hold of it.
A.B.P. Does the principle apply in the history of a soul, that what he is according to nature can be cleansed in relation to the waters of baptism; but evil which he allows as a Christian must be disposed of by fire?
J.T. It is a very solemn thing that while the believer contemplated in @1 Corinthians 3:15 shall be saved so as through the fire, his works shall all be burned up. They are no better than those of the ungodly. They are all consigned to the fire, but *he* is saved in that way.
A.N.W. Why is the material system involved in the overthrow with the moral system?
J.T. It is a question of divine purpose -- here expressed in promise -- a new heavens and a new earth. But the destruction of the present heavens and earth is linked
{402}
with that of ungodly men; as if their conduct affected the material universe. The force of this would be in reference to the place material things had with them.
W.B-w. They say, "from the beginning of the creation"; is that the idea? The reference to the old world before the flood is material, and the present evil world is material too.
J.T. The first had "its subsistence out of water and in water ... through which waters the then world, deluged with water, perished", @2 Peter 3:5,6. That is material, but it had its subsistence "by the word of God". And the present heavens and earth "by his word are laid up in store" for judgment. God is showing that the mockers base their teaching upon what is going to be burnt up. God will bring in a new heaven and a new earth! That is the thought; we understand it because we are already partakers of the new creation.
W.B-w. And Peter brings in "our beloved brother Paul", verse 15, to strengthen the truth of which he is speaking.
J.T. That shows how the apostles worked together. How glad you are to bring in another brother's ministry to confirm what you are saying!
J.S. So that the fire will be the test; the works of man, however long they may last, shall ultimately be burnt up and disappear.
J.T. Yes. The earth and the works that are therein shall be burnt up. What a day of materialism it is! We read of a certain king in the future -- evidently a subordinate person in the east -- who will worship the "god of fortresses", and not the god of his fathers, @Daniel 11:38. It is materialism. Today, in the world, it is largely a question of armaments, and with those who regard them most, God is left out.
C.W.M. Is there a suggestion in verse 12, that not only are we waiting for this, but we can hasten it?
J.T. Very suggestive! The passage says, "what ought
{403}
ye to be in holy conversation and godliness, waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God", verses 11,12; as if increase in these matters would hasten that day; so that if I am asking the Lord to come, I should be characterised by these things.
F.H.L. Due to the idolatrous worship of the heavenly bodies, they will also be destroyed, as unclean.
J.T. Quite so.
G.H. One is impressed by the beautiful language that Peter uses in his epistles; for instance, "excellent glory" and *"his* majesty" and "our beloved brother Paul".
J.T. It conveys affection and admiration for what is of God.
It has already been remarked that Peter speaks about the angels *sinning* , but Jude says, "And angels who had not kept their own original state, but had abandoned their own dwelling, he keeps in eternal chains under gloomy darkness, to the judgment of the great day", @Jude 6. That is *apostasy* ; they did not keep their original state. Jude speaks about the decline of Christianity and conditions of apostasy that surround us today. It is a most solemn consideration. The whole epistle, we may say, deals with that, and therefore he brings in what Enoch said. He prophesied, we are told, "as to these, saying. Behold, the Lord has come amidst his holy myriads, to execute judgment against all; and to convict all the ungodly of them of all their works of ungodliness, which they have wrought ungodlily, and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him", verses 14,15. That is what Jude is dealing with, and he sees the Lord coming amidst the *holy* myriads.
A.R. Jude goes beyond Peter, does he not? Peter stops with Balaam, whereas Jude goes on to the sin of Core, which is against the priesthood; it is open apostasy.
{404}
J.T. Quite so. Typically, Core's rebellion was against Christ as Apostle and High Priest.
A.P.T. Jude is fully in line with Peter as to apostolic authority: in verse 17 he says, "But *ye* , beloved, remember the words spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, @Jude 17" and then he corresponds with Peter also in his reference to the mockers: "that they said to you, that at the end of the time there should be mockers, walking after their own lusts of ungodlinesses", @Jude 18. The concurrence of their spiritual communications is remarkable.
J.T. Quite so. The unity of thought in the writings of Peter and Jude, Peter's reference to Paul's writings, and the reference to the leaders of the saints in @Hebrews 13 -- undoubtedly by Paul -- show how the Lord's prayer in @John 17:22,23, was fulfilled.
A.R.S. Would the fall of the angels be the origin of apostasy? It says that certain angels fell from their first estate.
J.T. Yes. Jude says that they kept not their original estate. It is not simply that they sinned, but they left the position that God assigned to them.
A.R.S. That is, what we see around us commenced with certain angels; and sin commenced with Satan.
J.T. Yes. "From the beginning the devil sins", (@1 John 3:8); sin in all its features began in him.
A.R. It makes the position of Christendom very humbling, that what had such an origin is developing in it.
J.T. These epistles enable us to see what is in mind in the development of sin; the actual beast has not yet come, but we are being made acquainted with him in these two epistles, so that we may learn, by what is current among the nations, to count the number of hi name. These epistles help us to do that. Peter deals with sin in its varied forms; Jude, too, of course, but he deals with it as in apostates, men who have actually
{405}
left the estate which God assigned to them, as professed believers in Christ. The whole position is not yet openly apostate; it is only as under the man of sin that it becomes that fully; but it is being developed, and that is the point for us.
A.B.P. Does verse 11 give three stages in the development of apostasy?
J.T. Yes. Notice the word "woe", a word found only once in the other epistles, although many times in Revelation. It says, "Woe to them! because they have gone in the way of Cain"; that is natural apostasy; "and given themselves up to the error of Balaam" @Jude 11; that is religious apostasy; "and perished in the gainsaying of Core", which is apostasy from government; from authority in Christ the Apostle and High Priest.
A.N.W. Do you mean religious government?
J.T. It would be mainly; it is abandoning authority; and of course that is religious authority in the case of Core, but then it has spread out into various forms, especially Bolshevism, that awful thing in Russia. That is the abandonment of divinely appointed authority.
J.H.E. Do we see the beginning of that in all who were in Asia having turned away from Paul, as in @2 Timothy 1:15?
J.T. Yes; they had forsaken Paul, in whom Christ's authority was vested. The Corinthian epistles stress that authority.
J.S. "These are spots in your love-feasts", (@Jude 12). Does that not come home to us?
J.T. Ungodly persons are seen as *going out* , as recorded by John; they have crept *in* , according to Jude. The system of which we have been speaking arrogates everything to itself, so that these persons are "they who set themselves apart, natural men, not having the Spirit", @Jude 19. That is monasticism. What a showy thing it is! It is pretended purity without having the
{406}
Holy Spirit. Then, over against that, is the beautiful word, "beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life", verses 20, 21. That is pure Christianity as introduced by Christ through His apostles.
A.R.S. The apostasy of which we have been speaking will be destroyed by the brightness of the Lord's coming.
J.T. "By the appearing of his coming (@2 Thessalonians 2:8)".
A.R.S. All the darkness will then be dispelled.
A.R. Why does he say, "keep yourselves in the love of God", and then, "to him that is able to keep you without stumbling"?
J.T. He is handing us over to God, as it were, as Paul handed the Ephesian elders over to God, saying, "I commit you to God", (@Acts 20:32). That is a magnificent statement. Here it is, "to him that is able to keep you without stumbling, and to set you with exultation blameless before his glory, to the only God our Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, might, and authority, from before the whole age, and now, and to all the ages. Amen", verses 24, 25. That is a wonderful ascription of praise to God.
J.S. It is a bright finish to this epistle.
J.T. Quite so; you can understand how a man like Jude would feel this. He was going to write about the gospel -- our common salvation -- but instead he writes this epistle, because of the urgency of the thing. How sensitive he was that they needed *God* ! And so do we need God to keep us "without stumbling".
E.S. You get here, those "Walking after their own lusts" @Jude 18 -- but Enoch walked, too.
J.T. Yes. He walked with God and he prophesied about these wicked men who walked after their own
{407}
lusts. The Lord will come amongst His holy myriads to deal with them.
J.T.Jr. I suppose that God's pleasure in Enoch coupled with the thought of "beloved" would open up the range of Ephesian truth.
W.B-w. Will you say something about the verse read in @1 John 3, "And every one that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as *he* is pure", verse 3?
J.T. I thought we might finish with that. There is not time to say much about it; but it is such an outlet. It is characteristically John's ministry. He is dealing with the subject of life -- Christ being it -- and he calls attention to the "love the Father has given to us, that we should be called the children of God. For this reason the world knows us not, because it knew him not", @1 John 3:1. And then he uses the same word that Peter and Jude use, "Beloved, now are we children of God, and what we shall be has not yet been manifested; we know that if it is manifested we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. And every one that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as *he* is pure". It is the thought of what we are to be, as he says, "what we shall be has not yet been manifested". It seems to have in mind the full position of Christ in heaven; not simply what He was during the forty days after He rose, but what He is now; for we are to be conformed to His "body of glory"; not simply His body in resurrection, but in *glory* .
J.S. Hence the need of having this hope is very important.
J.T. Quite so; and to purify ourselves as He is pure.
I was thinking of the word, "if it is manifested". He is thinking of what we are to be; it synchronises with Christ's manifestation: "For we shall see him as he is".
W.B-w. I think you have said that Solomon on the
{408}
throne typifies Christ as He *is* ; David typifies Him as He *was* . According to Philippians, we are to have bodies like unto His own body of glory, that is, like Christ as He is.
J.T. That is what I had in mind.
{409}
THE LORD'S COMING (7)
@Revelation 1:7; @Revelation 2:25 - 28, @Revelation 3:10,21; @Acts 1:9 - 11
J.T. No doubt all are aware that our subject is being considered in relation to the books in which it is found; what comes before us at this time should be viewed in relation to the book of Revelation, a book dealing with closing events of our dispensation, making way for another era. It was written to the seven assemblies which were in Asia, symbolical by their number of the whole assembly at that time, or by extension, the whole assembly from Pentecost until the Lord's return. It is a book that is peculiarly for the consideration of those who form the assembly; and although it treats of subjects outside of the present dispensation, we should be sufficiently interested to read them; in fact, there is a blessing attached to the reading of this book. It is said to be, "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him", @Revelation 1:1. The introduction therefore calls attention to the economy which God has brought in, and it is to be understood in the last days as at the beginning.
The present period is an economy set up in the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit -- the Son and the Spirit having taken places of subjection and service -- the Father being supreme, representing the Deity. So that the book of Revelation is said to be given to Christ by God. Verse 1 says God gave the Revelation to Him. The Lord is therefore seen in the place of subjection, receiving from God, in keeping with what He had said to the disciples after His resurrection when they inquired whether He would at that time restore the kingdom to Israel. He had said, "It is not yours to know times or seasons, which the Father has placed in his own authority", (@Acts 1:7). Now, according to the teaching of this book, the Father is giving to the
{410}
Son what is called a "revelation". It is said to be, "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to shew to his bondmen what must shortly take place, (@Revelation 1:1)".
Having these thoughts before us, we may understand a little better what is said about the Lord's coming specifically. There are more passages in the book referring to the Lord's coming than those read, but there will not be time to consider them now. The first is an allusion to the *manner* of it: "Behold, he comes with the clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they which have pierced him, and all the tribes of the land shall wail because of him", verse 7. The passage read in @Acts 1 amplifies this verse, the two men in white telling the disciples, "This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall thus come in the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven", verse 11. Stress is laid upon the *manner* of His going and coming.
J.S. In Acts 1, a cloud receives Him out of their sight. What do you understand by the clouds connected with His appearing here?
J.T. It is significant that they appear in both passages. In the Revelation, it is "he comes with the clouds"; that is, they are *all* in mind. In the passage in the Acts, it is *a* "cloud received him out of their sight". These passages lead up to the question of what clouds signify. They seem to point to the dignity of divine Persons. As they move publicly they are thus attended. The first mention of clouds is in @Genesis 9:13 where Jehovah says, "I set my bow in the clouds", as if it were a special distinction that He should utilise clouds for that purpose. And then in Exodus, the cloud is referred to constantly, from the movement out of Egypt, as a symbol of the divine presence, of divine dignity.
A.N.W. Why is it a voice 'out of the cloud' in Matthew
{411}
17, and 'from the heavens' in Matthew 3:17, saying, "This is my beloved Son",?
J.T. Well, each has its significance, having the glory of Christ m view. It is a *bright* cloud in @Matthew 17, intensifying what has been remarked. As to chapter 3, it is said that the heavens were *opened to Him* , which is another feature of His glory. The heavens are greatly stressed in Matthew.
H.H. "Eyewitnesses of *his* majesty" (@2 Peter 1:16) would relate to @Matthew 17. Peter speaks of what refers to majesty.
J.T. Quite so; so Matthew speaks about the bright cloud, and the voice coming out of it. It would be the Father's residence, so to speak. It was the Father's voice, but out of the cloud. In @1 Thessalonians 4:17 the apostle says, "caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air". The rapture is in mind. The correct reading is "in clouds". In Revelation it is *the* clouds -- the complete idea. But the idea of dignified attendance is in mind right through. In @Acts 1:7 the Lord says, "It is not yours to know times or seasons, which the Father has placed in his own authority". Then in @Mark 13:32, there is a similar statement: "But of that day or of that hour no one knows, neither the angels who are in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father",. The Lord is therefore placing this matter of times and seasons where it belongs; that is, in the Father's exclusive knowledge; not that other divine Persons are excluded from divine thoughts and counsels, but in the economy into which God has come, the Son and the Spirit are in the place of service and subjection, and all else is in the Father's hands.
W.B-w. Does the giving of further light to John, as recorded in the book of Revelation, affect that now?
J.T. This book, of course, was written since He spoke to the disciples at the beginning; it is "Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to shew to his bondmen what must shortly take place; and he signified
{412}
it, sending by his angel, to his bondman John", @Revelation 1:1. John is viewed here as a prophet -- a bondman, of course, but a prophet rather than an apostle. What the book contains, greatly adds to what the Lord had told the apostles, but there are certain things it does not disclose. We cannot say the day nor the hour; that is reserved by the Father.
H.H. Time is running out quickly now, but it is dealt with by the Father; and does not the position of Christ in Revelation stand in relation to that? It mentions periods of time, such as about half an hour, days, months, etc. The apportionment of time is under the hand of the Father.
J.T. Yes, the principle, "until the period fixed by the father", is mentioned in @Galatians 4:2. The question in @Acts 1:6 was, "Lord, is it at this time". It was not a question whether the kingdom of Israel would be restored; that was certain, but they had in mind the *time* of it. In @Mark 13:32 it is recorded, "But of that day or of that hour no one knows, neither the angels who are in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father",. That day and hour are still secret. No one is entitled to fix that date. It is in the Father's hand.
A.N.W. The Lord's words in Mark are precise on that point. Their query is, "when shall these things be?" @Mark 13:4.
H.H. Would it not indicate that there was not a right understanding of Christianity or of the assembly? The assembly having come in, has temporarily stopped the prophetic clock. Is that right?
J.T. Yes; Daniel had exercises like that. He went by books, and knew what to pray for at a given time, and then the answer is given in terms of appreciation of his exercises. He is said to be "greatly beloved", as he was praying. But then Gabriel goes on to say, "Seventy weeks are apportioned out upon thy people and upon thy holy city", @Daniel 9:24. That is what you allude to.
{413}
That period has still to run its course and enters into this book of Revelation, but Daniel is a representative man as to all this. He did not get everything in detail, but he got the general thought of seventy weeks, "to close the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make expiation for iniquity, and to bring in the righteousness of the ages, and to seal the vision and prophet, and to anoint the holy of holies", @Daniel 9:24. The culminating thing was that there should be the resumption of the service of God. And later he is told to go his way, and that he should stand in his lot at the end of the days. He lived on until the reign of Cyrus, who was to build the house. The seventy weeks began as the command went forth to restore and build Jerusalem, @Ezra 1:2. The period is therefore in a general way intelligible to faith. But then, what is intervening between the sixty-ninth and seventieth week is what we are speaking about, sixty-nine weeks (that is, seven weeks and sixty and two weeks) have elapsed, and there is but one remaining week still to come; indeed, there is a doubt as to whether it is to be a full week. It is more likely half a week, and therefore it requires great attention. But the exact date when the half-week begins cannot be reckoned; it hinges on the extent of the present dispensation. This is left open. When the saints are caught up to be with the Lord, according to @1 Thessalonians 4, then the reckoning can take place at once. It will be very brief.
H.H. Will you say a word as to why the assembly, as referred to in the first three chapters, comes into the prophetic range in Revelation?
J.T. There are three subdivisions which are made by the Lord Himself. Having touched John, He said, in verse 19, "Write therefore what thou hast seen @Revelation 1:19". That is one thing. It is the general vision; what he saw in relation to Christ according to chapter 1. Then, "the things that are, @Revelation 1:19" would relate to the seven assemblies.
{414}
And then, "the things that are about to be after these @Revelation 1:19". That has not transpired as yet. When those things begin is the question which we cannot answer. The Lord Himself leaves it in the Father's province as to when the assembly is to be actually translated. When that takes place we can count. The completion of the seventy weeks starts there. But it comes into this book and therefore applies to ourselves, for the Revelation is addressed to the seven assemblies.
Paul had special impressions which the twelve did not have. Those who understand the assembly involving the mystery, have instincts that exceed what the saints under the ministry of the twelve had. The Lord says to Saul, "why dost thou persecute me?"(@Acts 9:4). The saints were Himself. The mystery was bound up in that, and inasmuch as it is an organism, inclusive of the Lord Himself, in a sense -- because He is the Head of it -- there are instincts which did not exist before, and these instincts help us greatly as to the time of the Lord's return. The Spirit of God would cause us to be aglow with the thought of it. Hence, "Behold, the bridegroom; go forth to meet Him (@Matthew 25:6)". That midnight cry has gone out and has stirred up these spiritual instincts and affections that are in the organism -- the assembly. Then whilst you cannot speak definitely, you have the sense that things are coming to a close, yet we have to wait for the actual removal of the assembly to begin to count aright as to the last week referred to in Daniel.
C.A.M. What you say seems to throw light on these four words of the book -- "Revelation of Jesus Christ". His intimacy with the assembly brings it into the understanding of the book.
J.T. Quite so. He received this revelation from God. The assembly is taken into it as into all else relative to the testimony. Hence the Lord says, *"I* Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the
{415}
assemblies", (@Revelation 22:16). They stir up spiritual feelings and affections, so that the saints go forth to meet Him. The five wise virgins went forth with oil in their torches.
J.S. It corresponds with the day star arising in the heart.
J.T. Quite so. That is mentioned in the second scripture read. It bears on what we have just been remarking. The allusion is to the darkest period in the history of the public body; that is, the Middle Ages, when things were very dark, and the Lord says, in regard to the overcomer, "I will give to him the morning star", @Revelation 2:28. So the idea of Christ coming was already there in the Middle Ages, but it has been greatly augmented since. The revival, beginning about one hundred years ago, has stirred up affections and therefore there is more sensibility as to the coming of the Lord; yet one cannot fix dates.
C.A.M. Instincts really do not need a calendar.
J.T. You cannot put these things on a calendar. They are rather to be *felt* . The more we are in the living sense of belonging to the organism, the more sensitive we are that the time is near. It is even at the doors. It is really safer than an actual fixed time, because the sensibilities constitute you as ready for the Lord's return. The five wise virgins were ready as the midnight cry came; they had oil in their lamps and they went in with the bridegroom to the marriage.
H.H. The star is the hope of *another* day; not public recovery to Pentecost. It is to announce the coming of the Lord and not a sort of public return to Pentecostal conditions.
J.T. Yes; the removal of the candlestick is contemplated, hence another day of testimony is alluded to. A remnant is addressed and it is to hold fast what it had, "but what ye have hold fast till I shall come", (@Revelation 2:25). The Lord says, "I do not cast upon you any other burden", @(Revelation 2:24). We have the same remark to
{416}
Philadelphia, but the thought of the crown is added: "I come quickly: hold fast what thou hast, that no one take thy crown", @Revelation 3:11. The coming of the Lord is in prospect, and the word is to hold what you have; do not let it slip away, and then, let no one take your crown.
H.H. Would Samson's action in pulling up the doors of the gate at midnight fit in with the work of God in Thyatira? Then there are other features seen in the same chapter in Judges which all go through to the end.
J.T. Carrying the gate to Hebron would point to Colossians. It is the idea of power in view of another world, leading out of this one. Then later, Samson is in prison, which contemplates failure, but his hair begins to grow, which suggests recovery of life, having a remnant character, which leads to the world's overthrow. This power that has come in, in the way of life amongst the brethren, is the mark of the coming of the end. It brings down the world; it synchronises with the overthrow of the world. @Judges 16:18 - 31.
W.R. Is that what is in mind in chapter 1 of this book? It says, "the time is near", @Revelation 1:3.
J.T. The blessedness attached to the reading of the book would be in keeping with what it contains. In @Judges 16 there is a great act of power at midnight. The gate is taken up and carried to the top of the mountain. Samson's public position was disgraceful, but there was power in what he did as rising up. It points to an act of Christ in the sense of power; what was in the mind of God before this world. Hebron represents this. @Numbers 13:22. This world's gates are lifted out completely; its administrative power is overcome. The gates of hades do not prevail against the assembly, @Matthew 16:18.
W.B-w. Is that why a harlot is mentioned in @Judges 16, which has been referred to?
{417}
J.T. It is the Thyatira position, I suppose, but later Samson is in prison, which is most distressing. He had given away the secret of his power. However, his hair begins to grow in the prison and from that point on, the world is doomed. In carrying away the doors of the gate of Gaza, the inhabitants were not destroyed, but the growth of the hair portends the overthrow of the world, because the Philistines all come down by the power of Samson. That is a most remarkable thing, and I believe it is touched on in this book.
J.S. Would you link the growth of the hair with the present time?
J.T. Yes; it is life brought in. Many of us know that in the revival of the last hundred years, the great prophetic position was made clear, and then the truth of Christ as Head of the assembly was brought out; and then the great thought of eternal life was made prominent. That is how these features of the testimony stand. Now it is a question of bringing down the world -- *morally* , of course, as regards the testimony. The bringing down of the world, as we have said, synchronises with the growth of the hair.
H.H. Despised by the religious world (for they made sport of the servant of God), but still, his service was effective. The little strength in Philadelphia would correspond to the hair growing.
J.T. It would, I am sure.
A.N.W. You spoke of life and the spiritual instincts existing in the organism. Can we not find ourselves in Philadelphia on both lines?
J.T. Yes. Nothing can be more interesting than to find out just where Philadelphia is and what it is to have part in it; not pretending to be it, but still able to say "by God's grace I am what I am", (@1 Corinthians 15:10). It is well to be simple about things. As already mentioned, the order in which the truth has been developed in the last days is: the prophetic map; then Christ in
{418}
the assembly, operating in that sphere and dwelling in the hearts of the saints; then eternal life, which brings in a subject state of things, corresponding with the growth of Samson's hair and synchronising with that, the moral overthrow of the world. "Who is he that gets the victory over the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God?" (@1 John 5:5). So that there is victory over the world. This book shows that -- illustrated in what the Lord says to Philadelphia.
A.R. Showing, really, what progress has been made in the testimony since the truth of eternal life has been set out.
J.T. Quite so; eternal life has its place. When the Lord began to speak to His Father, as in @John 17:1 - 3, He says, "glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee; as thou hast given him authority over all flesh, that as to all that thou hast given to him, he should give them life eternal. And this is the eternal life, that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent",. Now that is the general preface to His prayer to His Father. And He further says, "and now glorify *me, thou* Father, along with thyself, with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was", @John 17:5. That is the finish of the preface, so to speak, because His deity is involved in that, that He is returning to glory, to have the same place that He had with the Father before the world was. And then He says, "I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest me out of the world. They were thine, and thou gavest them me, and they have kept thy word", @John 17:6. They were in his mind. I think from that point you get into the line of the Lord's thoughts as to what we are having now; the service of God; the heavenly calling; the glory that is given to Christ -- that the saints are to see His glory; the Father's love with which He loved the Son being in the saints and He in them. So it seems to me that from verse 6
{419}
of @John 17, we are in the sphere of the present time, where He is opening up for us the truth of the service of God and the heavenly calling, but eternal life must precede all that, though entering into it.
H.H. I suppose the out-of-the-world state in @John 17 (although we are still in it literally) would be apart from the system of things around, with hearts true to Christ and moving in relation to Him, because eternal life is over against the vitiated religious atmosphere that there is around.
J.T. Yes, I think the order in which the truth has come out is remarkable, and I believe @John 17 indicates it. The gospel of John is full of eternal life, yet He is pleased to tell His Father about it. "And this is the eternal life, that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent", @John 17:3. That is what came out about fifty years ago, when eternal life was brought to the attention of the brethren. The thing is to see the hair growing a little bit. It has been a question of growth according to the light furnished. The truth of eternal life has been made plain, but there is need of our minds and affections being enlarged according to the light afforded. In truth "*We* know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren", (@1 John 3:14). If you are conscious of loving the brethren, you have concrete evidence of it.
C.A.M. Do you not think that its development awaited certain light about verse 5? The matter of what is inscrutable had to be clarified in the minds of the saints?
J.T. I have no doubt that is so. God has helped us on @John 17:5 as over against the sonship of Christ. Verse 5 refers to His part in the Deity. He mentions His sonship in @John 17:1. "Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son"; it is not 'glorify me', but "thy Son". In @John 17:5, it is not "glorify thy Son", but "now
{420}
glorify *me* , thou Father, along with thyself, with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was". That is one divine Person speaking to Another in regard of a pre-incarnate condition.
H.H. You have said, that in @John 17:3, "the only true God" would stand over against idolatry; and that "Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent" would be the *true Man* and would stand over against lawlessness.
J.T. So the apostle Paul in meeting this matter of idolatry says, "yet to us there is one God, the Father",(@1 Corinthians 8:6). He does not say simply that there is one God the Father and one Lord Jesus Christ, but he prefixes the words "to us". That is, it is a question of the persons in whom the truth is made known. That is not Christendom as it is. A heathen man going into Christendom is entitled to expect to find that in persons, but does he? Who is meant by the "us"? If they are not found, there will be no concrete idea at all of the true God. It is what is known in persons.
J.S. So the "us" would be those in whom the revelation was made known?
J.T. It is made good in them. There are two thoughts. The first is, "No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared him". (@John 1:18). That is a remarkable expression; not saying that the declaration is to anyone, for it is due to God that the declaration should be in that public universal way. That is for any one, but then the other thing is the word "revelation". There is nothing said about revealing the Son. The Lord says, "no one knows the Son but the Father, nor does any one know the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son may be pleased to reveal him", (@Matthew 11:27). There is a person to whom the revelation is made; find that person, and you will get some idea of the one God; that is, it is not a matter of theology, it is the *state* of the person to whom the revelation is made. From
{421}
such persons you get some idea of the thing concretely, and that is what Paul means when he says, "to us there is one God" (@1 Corinthians 8:6) -- it is not merely that there is but one God, but to *us* there is one God. It is real Christianity. If you know those who are genuine, you have some idea of the one true God.
W.B-w. Do you mean that the "he to whom the Son may be pleased to reveal him" (@Matthew 11:27) is representative of the persons of whom you have been speaking?
J.T. That is what I mean. In such persons you get some true idea of God.
J.H.E. Would you say that Peter and John were like this in @Acts 3? They said, "Look on us".
J.T. Exactly; they were concrete representations of what the lame man needed to see.
J.S. Would revelation be private in character, and declaration more public?
J.T. I think so. Declaration is a general thought, The scripture says, "No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared him", (@John 1:18). That declaration is for anyone, but the work of God is needed for the appreciation of it, which John presents. In @1 Timothy 2:5 we have the testimony that "God is one, and the mediator of God and men one, the man Christ Jesus", but if you want to get the thing concretely, you must get the persons who have the revelation.
H.H. Each of the Persons has part in Deity, but Christianity presents the one God in the Father, and Christ and the Spirit are seen as moving in relation to Him.
J.T. Quite so; we are baptised "to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit", (@Matthew 28:19). The apostle says, "For and if indeed there are those called gods ... (as there are gods many, and lords many,) yet to us there is one God, the Father ... and *we* for him (@1 Corinthians 8:5,6)". That is God. And then there is one Lord,
{422}
who is He? "Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and *we* by him". @1 Corinthians 8:6. That brings up the whole question of the persons who are for the Father, and who has brought them in? How did it come about? Christ has effected it -- *"we* by him". It is a concrete thought; Christianity is not simply theories, not even what is written, but real persons to whom the revelation is made good.
A.R. Such persons are like Samson, over against the idolatrous condition that existed. The Philistines said, "Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hands", (@Judges 16:23). But he brought the whole system down, did he not?
J.T. That is right; the world of idolatry was brought down by the man who was alive, whose hair began to grow, which is a clear symbol of life.
A.P.T. Would John's line run concurrently with what is before us? At the close of his first epistle, he says, "Children, keep yourselves from idols", @1 John 5:21. Previously he had spoken of the Son of God having "given us an understanding", @1 John 5:20.
J.T. Yes. He also said of Christ, "He is the true God and eternal life", @1 John 5:20. In the period of the controversy concerning eternal life, the opposers said that eternal life is a Person. Really, it was derogatory to Christ, because they made the title of a *thing* the title of a divine Person; whereas the answer is that He is *more* than that; He is a divine Person -- the true God.
C.A.M. That He is the true God is the great and glorious answer to any derogatory remarks, and the Lord has helped us to get to that; to get the idea of Deity as in Him. Sonship is the relation in which He stands to God as Man, but personally. He is God and He never ceases to be God.
H.H. Eternal life can be shared with the saints, but Deity can not.
J.T. Quite so; this brings us back to what has been
{423}
said of the "little power" in Philadelphia, which runs parallel with the idea of life.
J.S. Over against Philadelphia, where we have the power of life seen in a little strength, is the worldly system exposed to us in Laodicea, so that we may be completely delivered from it?
J.T. The Lord's promise to Philadelphia should be noted: "Behold, I make them of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews, and are not, but lie; behold, I will cause that they shall come and shall do homage before thy feet, and shall know that *I* have loved thee", @Revelation 3:9. He thus honours the assembly possessed of the qualities He describes, and of course he urges us in this way to develop those qualities. The Lord speaks to Philadelphia as having a little strength, and keeping His word and not denying His name, and that introduces finality: "I come quickly". His affections are in that word "quickly".
A.R. Would the name "Philadelphia", meaning brotherly love, suggest that love is operating amongst the saints and the Lord loves these conditions?
J.T. Yes; and what He says to the overcomer implies that He understands: "He that overcomes, him will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more at all out; and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven, from my God, and my new name", @Revelation 3:12. You *must* have persons for Christianity. This verse opens up that in which the Lord has been instructing His people -- "my Father, and your Father, ... my God, and your God", (@John 20:17). So that we are on a high level in this address, and the Lord says, "hold fast what thou hast, that no one take thy crown (@Revelation 3:11)". It is needful for us to understand what this crown is.
A.N.W. Would the crown be our appreciation of divine Persons?
{424}
J.T. I would think so; the Lord has graciously helped His people as to Deity, especially the relations into which divine Persons have come in view of revelation. We must not let the truth slip; Let no one take thy crown. What can that be but Christ as known in the wonderful economy of the present dispensation?
A.B.P. Would the writing of "the name of the city of my God, new Jerusalem (@Revelation 3:12)", upon the overcomer, suggest that there is now a moral conformity to what is coming out in display, and that the Lord will claim that?
J.T. It seems that the overcomer is regarded by the Lord as understanding these things. Ask the average Christian what he understands by "a pillar in the temple of my God", and "the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem"; and again, Christ's "new name(@Revelation 3:12)". How many of us understand? If we do not know what these things mean, we shall hardly value what the Lord is promising here as distinction for the overcomer.
H.H. We have to be morally out of Babylon to know anything as to the city that comes down from God out of heaven.
W.B-w. Is there a connection with the writing in @2 Corinthians 3 and this writing in @Revelation 3?
J.T. The verses you refer to read, "*Ye* are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read of all men, being manifested to be Christ's epistle ministered by us, written, not with ink, but the Spirit of the living God; not on stone tables, but on fleshy tables of the heart", @2 Corinthians 3:2,3. The first writing, "written in our hearts", refers to himself, meaning that he loved the Corinthians; that is, it was like his letter of commendation -- he spoke so well about them -- they were first in his heart. He would speak to any brother he met about this wonderful work at Corinth, but then he turns it round and says, "being manifested to be Christ's epistle (@2 Corinthians 3:3)". They were his letter, in the sense that they were in his heart, but they were Christ's epistle, as he says, "Christ's epistle
{425}
ministered by us(@2 Corinthians 3:3)". His ministry had produced that effect -- Christ's epistle written in their hearts. We are to be capable as Christians of taking on divine impressions through the Spirit of God -- it is written on our hearts in that way. So that we take on impressions from Christ; we are like Him. In @Revelation 3:12, we have, "and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven, from my God, and my new name". What can be more interesting than that the Lord can take up a Christian and write on him externally -- not simply internally -- because that may be denied by what is external. This refers to state; what is external is equal to what is internal; that one is so entirely free from worldly consideration that the Lord can use him as material to write upon.
J.H.E. Would that be seen in Antioch? The disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.
J.T. Yes. It is not an ordinary word. The word *called* there has an oracular significance. It seems that God -- directly or indirectly -- caused that the disciples should be known by this significant appellation, identifying them with their Master.
W.B-w. That is, the outward entirely corresponds with the inward.
J.T. That is the idea. The disciples were called what they *were* .
H.H. The "fleshy tables of the heart" (@2 Corinthians 3:3) is that which can carry the writing.
J.T. Yes; fleshy tables of the heart are impressionable as over against "stone tables". It is the inward work of God. The external is striking because it is the side that is presented in the heavenly city -- that is public.
J.S. Will the external side, in Revelation, be in the sense of representation?
J.T. Well, I thought that. Think of a man walking down the street with these things written on him. I am
{426}
speaking figuratively, of course. He has the name of Christ and the name of His God written on him. Name is renown; it is a tribute to the period of Philadelphia that the overcomer in that assembly is capable of having such great names written on him. In @Leviticus 24, one is said to have *blasphemed* the Name, whereas here the name of Christ's God is written upon the overcomer in Philadelphia. Jehovah's name was to be put on the children of Israel. Aaron was directed to bless Israel: "Jehovah bless thee, and keep thee; Jehovah make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee; Jehovah lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace. And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel; and I will bless them", (@Numbers 6:24 - 27). It is on a blessed people, evidently through the state of Nazariteship, as the chapter indicates. And I believe that is what is in mind in @Revelation 3:12; such material that a divine Name can be written thereon -- "the name of my God", the Lord says.
J.S. Would there be moral order here? The city is referred to next.
J.T. I think so. You can see how we are ready to be in the heavenly city, if we are externally equal to divine writing, because the external side is presented in the heavenly city.
H.H. Philadelphian conditions, as found among the saints, afford a very suitable opportunity for the coming in of Christ now. If the conditions are there, the man "carrying a pitcher of water", (@Mark 14:13), would still direct one in a difficult day like this to where there are conditions into which the Lord can come.
J.T. Quite so. You feel that this has been in mind from the outset of the revival, that there should be external conditions that Christ can write upon; that He can make certain persons certain things.
W.B-w. Would being a pillar in the temple come in by way of Nazariteship?
{427}
J.T. Jehovah's name was put upon Israel in relation to the Nazarite; that is, it is Christ blessing His people as in the light of Nazariteship. I think it may be introduced into what we have here. There is a state secured that conveys the truth that has been brought out. That is what is meant, I think. The Lord is honouring Philadelphia in that He is speaking to the overcomer in this way.
J.T.Jr. I was wondering about the four men in the book of Daniel. New names were put upon them. Would that illustrate how the world would seek to put false names on that which is truly of Christ? The Hebrew children were named according to the names of the gods of Babylon.
J.T. That brings up an interesting point. In spite of what the world may call us, we are to remain *ourselves* . What they call us is not to alter us. "I am what I am (@1 Corinthians 15:10)". Those four men retained what they were and would not defile themselves.
J.T.Jr. Was it not really over against God's name? God had said, "they shall put my name upon the children of Israel", (@Numbers 6:27), but the prince of this world would say, I will put my name on them.
A.B.P. Does not that develop later in the mark of the beast?
J.T. Yes; the effort will be to put the beast's name, or the number of his name, on all.
A.R. Does this writing suggest that we are holding the truth not merely abstractly, but vitally in our souls and it thus can be seen publicly?
J.T. Quite so; and that brings out what the saints are, as has been remarked. Peter says, "Look on us". The truth was there in Peter and John, and so now at the end, the Lord, I believe, would bring out such external appearances amongst us that He can use to indicate what the truth is that has brought about this condition.
{428}
A.N.W. Something like the name of the city, according to Ezekiel? The name of the city is Jehovah-Shammah, meaning, "Jehovah is there".
J.T. Quite so; that comes in very fittingly. The Lord has helped His people and will help them so that they will be available for this writing.
J.S. So you have, in accord with this writing, the city coming "down out of heaven, from my God (@Revelation 3:12)". In the end of the book it is thus seen all glorious.
J.T. As the saints are formed by the light and instruction divinely furnished, they are ready for this public display. It is not what is inward. It is the public position that is in mind.
S.F. What would the "new name" be?
J.T. It is a test to us, for it is a question of God's secret; what we have come into, I believe, in relation to the Lord's supper and all the spiritual thoughts that He is developing. I believe that is what is in mind. It is different and in contrast to what is current religiously in a public sense.
H.H. The Lord has furnished the saints with a fuller measure of intelligence as to His Person, especially His sonship. I think that is a part of the new name.
J.T. It is likely, too, that the pressure that has come upon us -- upon the world also, but peculiarly upon the saints -- is to develop the truth in us. Pressure enlarges us. @Psalm 4:1. The Lord intends to make real what He has been ministering to His people, that they should be exponents of it. The recurrence of the words, "my God", in our passage is to be noted. He says, "him will I make a pillar in the temple of my God ... . and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven, from my God, and my new name (@Revelation 3:12)". It brings out what we are in relation to Him according to @John 20:17 -- "my Father, and your Father,
{429}
... my God, and your God". And then "my new name" would evidently fit in there.
A.P.T. Is not the service of the Holy Spirit in regard to all this very touching? In all these addresses the Lord says, "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies (@Revelation 3:13)".
J.T. Whatever has come to us from the outset that is of God has been by the Spirit; but in view of the displacement of the Spirit in the public body. His speaking is stressed in the addresses to the assemblies. Traditional teaching ignores Him. Sometimes there are those who say, I do not go with that, just because it was not said earlier. Still it may be needed as present truth - what the Spirit *is* saying. That attitude of mind is met by the repeated words of Christ here, "He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies"(@Revelation 3:13) -- not what He *has* said, but what He *is* saying. Of course, the saints are not to accept everything they hear, but an exercised ear will discern the Spirit's voice; and then we are enjoined to "prove all things, hold fast the right", (@1 Thessalonians 5:21). The Bereans were noble, "receiving the word with all readiness of mind, daily searching the scriptures if these things were so", (@Acts 17:11).
W.B-w. Referring again to "the city of my God, the new Jerusalem", (@Revelation 3:12) do you think we would be helped in administration locally if we were in the good of these names? The name of the city is "the new Jerusalem". It would help us in administration if we are in accord with that.
J.T. Yes; it is remarkable how much has come out as to administration, because the word city peculiarly has that in mind; and the gates, too. The gates of Gaza taken up by Samson would mean that the power of the world's administration religiously was nullified; administration in the public body is largely patterned on worldly principles, but Samson broke that up and then he brought the world down. In type, the whole thing is
{430}
brought down by him in the pulling down of the pillars that supported the Philistine house.
The word *new* is important. New Jerusalem refers to what the saints *are*; what has been effected in them, which is attested in the city in chapter 21.
W.R. Did the Lord have that in mind when He referred to Jerusalem as the city of the great king?
J.T. I have no doubt that is so. Jerusalem took on a new name in the administration of the apostles; so Paul says, "but the Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother", (@Galatians 4:26). That certainly is a new thought. New Jerusalem and "my" new name stand together as truth -- over against the oldness of Christendom, as marked by worldly principles and ways. The thought of what is new begins in the teaching of @Romans 12:2 -- "by the renewing of your mind". It is the same word; to bring out what is new or different to anything that has preceded. The Christian's mind is different: "renewed into ... knowledge", (@Colossians 3:10); the new man is thus different in his knowledge. Then the "renewal of the Holy Spirit", (Titus 3:5). All this is calculated to help us to follow the line of the word new, and reach the final thought as applied to Christ's name.
A.R. Would you say something about "He that overcomes, to him will I give to sit with me in my throne; as *I* also have overcome, and have sat down with my Father in his throne", verse 21.
J.T. It carries us on to the change of dispensation, as does the allusion here to the Lord's coming to the assemblies, that is, leaving His Father's throne and taking His own throne. He is on His Father's throne now, which is grace, but the overcomer is carried on into the coming dispensation, when he will sit with Him on His throne in the millennium.
A.B.P. The overcomer would value that as loving His appearing?
{431}
J.T. Quite so. He had said to the remnant in Thyatira, "he that keeps unto the end my works" -- notice that it says *to the end*, because we are getting through -- "to him will I give authority over the nations, and he shall shepherd them with an iron rod; as vessels of pottery are they broken in pieces, as I also have received from my Father; and I will give to him the morning star", @Revelation 2:26 - 28. He does not say that the overcomer in Thyatira will sit with Him in His throne. He gives him authority over the nations if he carries on until the end; meaning that Jezebel was ruling Christendom then, and the saints were suffering, of course, but the suffering saints will then rule with an iron rod, but with the spirit of shepherding, which is very different from Jezebel. The last promise, which is made to the overcomer in Laodicea, is "to him will I give to sit with me in my throne".
F.S.C. Is the crown being held for that? It says, "that no one take thy crown (@Revelation 3:11)".
J.T. I think that is right. He Himself, I am sure, is our crown. What is the crown to a lover of Christ but Christ Himself? Christ as known in these circumstances. What an honour to sit with Him in His throne! Correspondence with Him is the point: as He has sat down with His Father in His throne, we sit with Christ in His throne.
A.P.T. The word also is to be noted in that verse. *"I* also have overcome", the Lord says.
{432}
THE LORD'S COMING (8)
@Revelation 10:1 - 7; @Revelation 11:15 - 18; @Revelation 14:14 - 16; @Revelation 19:11 - 16; @Revelation 22:16,17
J.T. At our last meeting, we considered the subject of the Lord's coming as presented in chapters 1, 2, and 3 of Revelation. The passages just read will suffice to cover the remainder of our subject as treated in this book. There are other references, but these should suffice. The features of our subject which we should now consider are: chapter 10, the Lord Jesus coming out to assert His rights to the sea and the land; chapter 11, the acquirement of the kingdom: "The kingdom of the world of our Lord and of his Christ is come"; chapter 14, the reaping of the earth, which is an important subdivision; chapter 19, Christ's coming out as a heavenly Warrior to overcome His enemies in battle; chapter 22, well known to us. His presentation of Himself to the assemblies, to draw out the response of the saints. It culminates with the expression of our love for His appearing; "the Spirit and the bride say. Come".
Chapter 10 is of peculiar importance, because it alludes to the assertion of the rights of Christ in the testimony, inclusive of what is current at the present time. He comes out as a strong Angel, but the accompanying features indicate clearly that it is the Lord Himself. "And I saw another strong angel coming down out of the heaven, clothed with a cloud, and the rainbow upon his head, and his countenance as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire, and having in his hand a little opened book", verses 1, 2. It alludes, we understand, to the history of Europe; the earth being taken possession of from that part of the world. The Lord is seen as asserting His right to all -- both sea and land.
{433}
C.A.M. Is the idea in this scripture, the whole creation, and the next is more the kingdom?
J.T. Yes. The first would be the whole earth, the sea and the land. @Genesis 9 being in mind in the reference to the rainbow. That is, God's faithfulness in regard to creation is carried down. The subsequent division of the races of the world into kingdoms would be alluded to in the next scripture. That is, these kingdoms are replaced by "The kingdom of the world of our Lord and of his Christ". It is not that the kingdoms *become* Christ's, but *His* kingdom is introduced. It is "The kingdom of the world of our Lord and of his Christ", @Revelation 11:15.
J.S. There is not a kingdom in this world that He can take over; He sets them aside and brings in His own.
J.T. That is the thought -- a very important distinction pointed out throughout scripture, especially in Daniel's prophecy, that a kingdom should come in after the kingdoms of the nations have done their service. The stone cut out without hands breaks up all the others and fills the whole earth. Satan's suggestion to the Lord was "I will give thee all this power, and their glory; for it is given up to me, and to whomsoever I will I give it", (@Luke 4:6). He would give them to the Lord if He worshipped him. The Lord is not taking over the kingdoms of the world. He will bring in His own kingdom. He said before Pilate that His kingdom is not of this world.
The earth in chapter 10 is more the creation - the sea and the land, not the people on it. A kingdom requires people. The passage reads, "And the angel whom I saw stand on the sea and on the earth lifted up his right hand to the heaven, and swore by him that lives to the ages of ages, who created the heaven and the things that are in it, and the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that are in it, that
{434}
there should be no longer delay; but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound the trumpet, the mystery of God also shall be completed, as he has made known the glad tidings to his own bondmen the prophets", chapter 10: 5 - 7. It is the Lord who appears in this testimonial way as the strong angel. It is as the final trumpet is about to be sounded, because that trumpet is to finish the matter. That transpires in chapter 11. The testimony or sounding of the seventh angel brings about the completion of the mystery of God. We are now in the period of that mystery, but then it will be completed.
W.R. Did the Lord Jesus have this kingdom in mind in all His references to the kingdom of the heavens?
J.T. Well, the kingdom of the heavens in @Matthew 13 is what is current now. It is seen as the kingdom of God generally in the other gospels and the epistles, which is the moral side of it. The former is enlarged on parabolically in that chapter. It is the present form the kingdom has taken, into which we have been brought. We cannot see the kingdom of God unless we have been born again, according to @John 3:3. The kingdom in @Revelation 11 is the coming one -- the kingdom of the world of our Lord and of His Christ. It is the public kingdom of the coming world.
G.V.D. Do these two scriptures. @Revelation 10 and 11, correspond with @Acts 4:26?
J.T. Yes; the kings of the earth were gathered against the Lord and His Christ. His kingdom would be involved in the term, "his Christ", in @Acts 4; but @Revelation 11 is the public kingdom that is presently to appear. The Mount of Transfiguration - particularly Matthew's account of it -- gives us this kingdom; "the Son of man coming in his kingdom (@Matthew 16:28)".
A.R. Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom power was conferred; whereas this power in @Revelation 10 *belongs* to Christ? He takes it as belonging to Him.
{435}
J.T. It does belong to Him, because the rainbow on His head denotes His creative rights, but He is true to His engagements in regard to the creation. One has come who will be true to covenants. He takes up and asserts His rights to the sea and the land, which is the whole terrestrial sphere. It is a question of the earth.
W.B-w. Does that work out in the gospel now? Does the Lord establish His rights in the gospel before the public thing comes in?
J.T. He does; the gospel is said to be preached to all creation. It is *men* that are in mind in the proclamation of the gospel, but still, it is to the creation. In @Revelation 10 territory is in view. The sea and the land are essential to the millennial state of things. There is a witness to His rights now in what is ministered among the saints, because the mystery of God is known amongst the saints. His rights to the creation as such are involved in the ministry that we have by the Spirit in the assembly. The *mystery* enters into the assembly.
J.S. In faith we maintain it. Satan has usurped it.
J.T. Quite so; if we love the Lord Jesus, we do not fail to indicate plainly enough that He owns the property. The earth is His. "The earth is Jehovah's, and the fulness thereof", (@Psalm 24:1). Satan said the kingdoms were his, but the property -- the land and the sea -- belongs to the Lord on creative and redemptive grounds.
J.T.Jr. Would two beasts that arise -- one out of the land and one out of the sea -- allude to the way man would lay claim to them?
J.T. Just so; it is remarkable how each of the four empires developed in that way. The question of territory was always present in these extensions of empire. The little opened book here is in contrast to what is sealed. Two thoughts run down through scripture -- what is opened and what is sealed. Jeremiah speaks of both. The book in @Revelation 5 is sealed. The Lord opens
{436}
that as the Lion of the tribe of Judah; that is to say. He opens up the sealed thoughts of God, as regards the inheritance. It is the book of the inheritance. This book in @Revelation 10 is opened, but it is not the same book that is seen in chapter 5: it is not simply that it is open, but it is *opened* . That is how it reads: "... having in his hand a little opened book", chapter 10:2. It would be over against the mystery of iniquity; that is, the public history of Europe is discerned for us in this book. Europe has been the centre of all this matter of territorial possession for more than twenty centuries. Of course, it had been in Asia under Nebuchadnezzar and under the Persians, but the Alexandrian empire was a European matter, extending into Asia, and that has been the position ever since. I think this little book in the Lord's hand implies that the matter, although very complicated in politics in the counsels of the nations, is simple to faith.
A.N.W. Is it little in relation to the great eternal things?
J.T. That is what is meant, I think. It is very small as over against other matters. It is not like one of the books that John speaks of that the world could not contain if they were all written. It is not the history of Christ; that would be a big matter. It is the history of something in itself comparatively insignificant, but still important to be understood; the Lord has it in His hand, and the prophet eats it. He is told to do so, and in eating it, it is sweet in his mouth and bitter in his stomach, meaning that it refers to certain things that will happen, causing real bitterness to those who have faith and who love the Lord Jesus and His people. You do not look for any rectification of conditions in the world of politics or the international world. All you can expect is an amelioration of conditions and *a hindering* of the mystery of iniquity; a limitation of sin while the Spirit is here. As this ceases, the position
{437}
will be dreadful. We shall not be in it, but scripture shows that the saints who go through it will endure what we hardly realise. The little book is opened; you can go and turn over the pages, so to speak, and see for yourself; and it does not take long. It is not of deep intricate importance like the book of the inheritance. It is a *little* one and it is *opened* . The book of chapter 5 is written "within and on the back", @Revelation 5:1 as containing *much* and was sealed with seven seals, which only the Lion of the tribe of Judah could open. But He opens it, seen by John as the Lamb slain -- indicating that redemption was needed in order that the inheritance should be clear and the saints brought into it. The door opened refers to the liberty given us to enter into divine thoughts and move on in testimony, but this little opened book is a matter easily taken in; inasmuch as it is small and opened. I think if we understand it as John did, we shall feel the bitterness; indeed, as Elisha did when he wept before Hazael, anticipating all he was to do to his people, @2 Kings 8:10 - 12. This little book would indicate the terrible sufferings of the future.
A.N.W. Do you refer to what is current?
J.T. Chapter 10 is the testimony to the Lord's rights, as we have already remarked. It is constantly brought in that everything belongs to Christ; as Paul said in announcing the gospel at Athens, which, of course, is in Europe, "God, therefore, having overlooked the times of ignorance, now enjoins men that they shall all everywhere repent, because he has set a day in which he is going to judge the habitable earth in righteousness by the man whom he has appointed", (@Acts 17:30,31). It belongs to God.
W.B-w. Would the Lord putting His right foot on the sea and the left on the land indicate that He is holding things in the meantime?
J.T. Yes, in testimony; command of the sea is an
{438}
immense thing in an international situation. That is well known throughout history. Napoleon never commanded the sea; although he conquered almost everything on the continent of Europe, he never got control of the sea; and that was largely the occasion of his downfall. The Lord here takes possession of the sea first and then the land.
A.B.P. And heaven, too? Is it a tripartite sphere that is in view? It says the angel "lifted up his right hand to the heaven, and swore by him ... who created the heaven and the things that are in it, and the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that are in it", verse 5,6.
J.T. The point here is what is taken possession of -- He puts His right foot on the sea and the left upon the earth. It is the earth that is under dispute. The allusion is to what we call international, what has been the occasion of conflict from the time of the establishment of the four empires.
J.S. In relation to the course of the testimony down here?
J.T. Yes. The heavenly side is secured. The "male son" being caught up into heaven in this book means that heaven is secured. The record of the Lord's birth, in Luke, states that the angels said, "... on earth peace, good pleasure in men", @Luke 2:14. The thought, however, was laid aside as He proceeded with His ministry. The earth would come in last; hence, in @Luke 19:38, it says, "... peace in heaven, and glory in the highest",. So the heavens are taken possession of already in that Christ has gone in there and we belong to that sphere. The assembly belongs to it, and in the light of Ephesians it is already there in Christ. Satan is still there as the accuser of the brethren, but in principle he is displaced -- cast-out -- for the Lord says, "I beheld Satan as lightning falling out of heaven", (@Luke 10:18). What is in mind in Revelation is the
{439}
acquiring of the earth. Even those who may be regarded as enemies "gave glory to the God of the heaven", @Revelation 11:13; but in that they ignore His rights on the earth.
A.N.W. His leadership is stated in relation to heaven, chapter 19:11, but the kingdom is in relation to the sea and the earth.
J.T. Everything issues from heaven. The dispute is as to the earth. Satan is cast out of heaven in chapter 12. Literally, he is there, but not in control, because Christ has gone in and the assembly is there in Him -- in the "male son" -- caught up.
A.P.T. The two witnesses in chapter 11 are called up to heaven. It says that their enemies beheld them. Would that confirm the thought?
J.T. Their testimony, as on earth, belongs to it. The allusion as to them is in @Zechariah 4:14 "These are the two sons of oil, that stand before the Lord of the whole earth",. It is a question of the earth; that is really the issue in this book. The assembly comes down out of heaven; she is the bride. She is seen as up there from chapter 4. And then, at the end, she is regarded as on earth, saying with the Spirit, "Come", as the Lord announces Himself. This is to be linked with chapters 1 to 3. So that things are settled as regards the heavens. The issue is the earth, and that is why the Lord comes in here, in chapter 10, in such remarkable power.
J.S. So chapter 10 would agree with Matthew's presentation of the Lord on the mount? "There are some of those standing here that shall not taste of death at all until they shall have seen the Son of man coming in his kingdom", (@Matthew 16:28).
J.T. Quite so. And it also agrees with @Matthew 25: "But when the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit down upon his throne of glory, and all the nations shall be gathered before him", @Matthew 25:31,32.
{440}
A.Pf. Is that not the fulfilment of @Daniel 7:13,14, "I saw in the night visions, and behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like a son of man, and he came up even to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed"?
J.T. It corresponds; that is the prophetic word governing that of which we are speaking. Those verses, in a very complete way, cover these two passages -- chapters 10 and 11. Chapter 11 is completion actually; "The kingdom of the world of our Lord and of his Christ is come", verse 15. It is established here in millennial glory. "He shall reign to the ages of ages". This instruction is most essential to every one of us at the present time so that we might have a clear view of the coming of the Lord, which bears on all this; that He has taken possession in testimony of the sea and the land, and He is telling us of the completion of the matter, which will take place after the seventh angel sounds. This is referred to in chapter 11, where it says, "and there were great voices in the heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world of our Lord and of his Christ is come, and he shall reign to the ages of ages. And the twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before God, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God, saying. We give thee thanks. Lord God Almighty, He who is, and who was, that thou hast taken thy great power and hast reigned", chapter 11: 15 - 17. So it brings in worship. As we receive this truth into our souls, we become worshipful.
J.T.Jr. What connection is there between the government that God set up in Nebuchadnezzar and that which followed in the succeeding kingdoms? It says in Daniel 7:15 - 18, "As for me Daniel, my spirit was grieved in
{441}
the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me. I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the certainty of all this. And he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things: These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, that shall arise out of the earth. But the saints of the most high places shall receive the kingdom, and they shall possess the kingdom for ever, even to the ages of ages",.
J.T. It is one idea, which is presented earlier in the book in a great image. It is the idea of a person. You might call it a monstrosity, but it has certain elements of God in the beginning under Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom, represented in the gold. Then the silver would suggest deterioration, but still, what is of value. Following that there is the brass, and then the iron and clay. It is the idea of deterioration from the beginning of the rule of the Gentiles to the end; it is one great idea set forth in an image. Then it is seen in four ideas; that is, the first, the Babylonian kingdom under Nebuchadnezzar; then the Medo-Persian, a weaker kingdom; then the Grecian kingdom, and finally the Roman, which comes right down, having the greatest domination and arresting the attention of the prophet more than any other. Its worst feature is still to come, but however strong it may be, it will be broken in pieces. That is the testimony here. We are looking for "The kingdom of the world of our Lord and of his Christ".
A.R. The image in Daniel has much to do with the western world, as you have said. Have you any thought as to where the East will appear in all this?
J.T. The four monarchies began in the East. The Babylonish kingdom was in Asia, and so was the Medo-Persian. Alexander overcame the Persians, but died in the procedure, and then his kingdom was divided into four parts. That has a great place in Daniel; but that develops into two, the northern and southern kingdoms,
{442}
spoken much of in chapter 11. Alongside of that, you have the Romans coming up; they commanded the prophet's attention more than any. That is the fourth kingdom. It is the one under which Christ suffered; under which the apostles suffered; under which the gospel has been preached; under which the assembly has been called, and in connection with which is seen the mystery of iniquity which is now current; so that it became of immense importance, and the saints should understand it. And this little opened book refers to it. It is the most important of all the empires, and culminates in open hostility to God and to Christ. We are instructed as to it, particularly in Daniel and the book of Revelation. It should be understood by us if we are to move in faith. Thus we understand what is current today and what is going to come out of it, which will be terrible persecution for the people of God, and this book tells us about it. The assembly is to be kept out of this, chapter 3:10.
J.S. Is it not remarkable that Asia as such has come under the domination of the power of Europe?
J.T. In a sense, Alexander took it over. His empire developed into the northern and southern kingdoms in @Daniel 11, as we have noted. They are prominent in prophecy mainly because of their relation with the Jews. The main authoritative part of the world has remained in Europe since Alexander's time. It finally came into the hands of the Romans. This second scripture is to establish us in our minds as to "the kingdom of the world of our Lord and of his Christ". It is a world by itself. It is the kingdom of the millennial world.
A.N.W. Did you say "Our Lord" referred to "Jehovah"? Is it thus used elsewhere?
J.T. Yes; in @Psalms 2 and 8, for instance. Here it is "our Lord and his Christ" -- two Persons. "Our Lord", we may say, is the Father. This book takes up
{443}
terms from the Old Testament; in chapter 4, to illustrate, the living creatures say, "Holy, holy, holy. Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come", @Revelation 4:8. "Lord God Almighty" is carried over, being an Old Testament title. So that we have, you might say, an Old Testament position: "The kingdom of the world of our Lord and of his Christ is come, and he shall reign to the ages of ages", chapter 11:15. And the same expression appears in chapter 11:17, "We give thee thanks. Lord God Almighty, He who is, and who was, that thou hast taken thy great power and hast reigned". That is *God* ; it is full Deity.
J.S. Do not the titles merge here in the expression, "He shall reign"? Do they merge in the Anointed?
J.T. I think the reigning is applied to God, and Christ is the Messiah, although both God and Christ reign. The same is true now, for the Lord has sat down with His Father in His throne. The trinity of evil is over against this.
C.A.M. Would you say that as seen in the end of Matthew's gospel, the disciples reached this when they did Him homage? And then as a final touch in that gospel you get the three Persons of the Godhead.
J.T. Just so. They recognised Him as God and did Him homage. @Matthew 28:19 is the Deity in relation to the present economy, alluded to in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
J.T.Jr. Would the allusion to the Almighty entitle us to link this matter up with Abraham? I have in mind the way divine Persons had to do with him in opening up the secrets of the world to him.
J.T. I think so. Noah's time is alluded to, also. How comprehensive all this is! The Lord says, "... the mystery of God also shall be completed, as he has made known the glad tidings to his own bondmen the prophets", chapter 10:7. Abraham was one of them. God calls him a prophet.
{444}
F.N.W. Is the mystery of God more extensive than the mystery of Christ in Ephesians?
J.T. It is a question of the context of each. The mystery, as alluding to the assembly, means that God is taking up everything in Christ and the assembly. He has made Christ "head over all things" and given Him "to the assembly, which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all", @Ephesians 1:22. That is the Ephesian side of the truth; it was revealed to Paul. This mystery in @Revelation 10 refers to God's rights in relation to the earth, involving His government; what He had confided to His servants the prophets is now to be completed. The prophets are filled with this subject-how the earth is to come under the authority of Christ at His coming. And so verse 7 reads, "the mystery of God also shall be completed, as he [that is, God] has made known the glad tidings to his own bondmen the prophets".
A.P.T. Does the multiplicity of armaments in the world have the effect upon the spirits of Christians of minimising the sense of God's power?
J.T. I am sure the enemy intends it to do that, because the antichrist will worship the god of fortresses -- the god of physical force -- whereas God would occupy us with *His* power. That is why I think the Lord Jesus is presented in such a striking way in our chapter; "... his countenance as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire, and having in his hand a little opened book. And he set his right foot on the sea, and the left upon the earth, and cried with a loud voice as a lion roars. And when he cried, the seven thunders uttered their own voices", verses 1 - 3. That is, God's powers are indicated.
W.B-w. Chapter 11:19 says, "And the temple of God in the heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen in his temple: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail". Why is that introduced?
{445}
J.T. I think that is a new subject; it belongs to what is in the next chapter. The temple and the ark imply intelligence, accorded of God, as to all that He is doing. I believe that is what is meant by "temple of God". You get more of it in this book than in any other. It is the word "temple" *(naos)* that is used; where God speaks and makes His mind known to us. Here, however, evidences of divine power accompany the opening of the temple, and the ark of God's covenant is seen in it.
All is there; and so that the saints will understand, it is opened. It is the temple of God in heaven, and the ark of the covenant is seen there; meaning that God's mind is there, and the ark -- the power of God -- outwardly small, is there to meet all these conditions. The scene is to attract our view to Christ and the communication of the mind of God in Him.
J.S. It shows us what goes through.
J.T. Quite so; the ark must go through. It is the Man by whom God accomplishes everything. Christ is the Messiah; the Anointed One; the Ark -- the power of God and the glory of God, see @Psalms 78:61;132:8.
A.R. What would you say about verse 18: "... the time of the dead to be judged, and to give the recompense to thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and to those who fear thy name, small and great"?
J.T. That is very comforting if we want to retain the sense of being in God's service in all these matters; in spirit already entering into what is going to happen in the future. There are remarkable things happening now, and we want to be in the attitude of being in God's service, taking His side in everything. It is very encouraging that nothing is omitted. All is in the mind of God -- every bit of recompense. It should encourage us to take sides with God in current events.
J.S. That verse continues, "and to destroy those that destroy the earth".
{446}
J.T. That is remarkable; the general bent of certain elements is to destroy the earth, but *they* will be destroyed.
Ques. How do we take sides with God in current events?
J.T. You take His view of the matter. You are not national in your spirit. What *He* is working out is before you. What is happening is not accidental, and it is for us to see what it is and be with God; because we are apt to think far more of what is public in these events than of what God is doing. Enquiring thus, we are drawn to God's side. We want to be in His service in war, taking sides with Him.
J.T.Jr. I suppose we should discern where the testimony has been prospered of God. God is helping those nations.
J.T. God is Judge of all the earth, as Abraham says. This matter begins there, and then the authority of God in dealing with Sodom and Gomorrah comes into view -- that is, the thought of God dealing with the earth in judgment. "And Jehovah said. Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing? ... For I know him that he will command his children and his household after him", (@Genesis 18:17 - 19). And Abraham says, "Will not the Judge of all the earth do right? (@Genesis 18:25)" That is an immense thing to have in our souls. Accordingly, we are with God. There were four kings against five, we are told in @Genesis 14. Well, Abraham was not with either group; he was with God, and his business in the whole matter was to rescue his brother. So that for us the brethren are the issue in what is transpiring.
J.S. How do you view the verses read in @Revelation 14?
J.T. I thought it was a question of the earth - the harvest being come. The mention of the harvest here enables us to call attention to the importance of reading Scripture contextually. In @Deuteronomy 16 the harvest
{447}
being reaped, the feast of tabernacles follows. The fruit of the earth, in a positive sense, is for God. But this is judgment; it seems to be an ironical word as to the development of sin in this world; and God says, as it were. The time has come; the thing is fully there. The fruit is old and dry. The foot-note in the New Translation says "withered". It is more than fully ripe; it is *over-ripe* . It is not the fresh fruits of the earth; judgment is in mind. God is going to deal in this drastic way with what has developed, and the Lord Jesus Christ has the sickle in His hand as the Son of man.
W.B-w. The ingathering follows the feast of harvest in connection with the good things, and the ingathering for judgment here follows the harvest.
J.T. The section we read, verses 14 - 16, refers to "the harvest of the earth", and the next section refers to the *vine:* "... gather the bunches of the vine of the earth", @Revelation 14:18.
W.B-w. The "wine-press of the fury of God", (@Revelation 14:19) shows it is judgment.
J.T. It is the vine of the earth. It is a description of a class who profess to be in relationship with God; but the *harvest* of the earth is more general. The vine would be Jews or Christians who stand professedly in relation to God, but have proved utterly unfaithful and merit the severest judgment.
W.R. Would you say something as to the nature of the judgment exercised by the "one sitting like the Son of man"?
J.T. "The Father ... has given to the Son also to have life in himself, and has given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is Son of man", (@John 5:27). All judgment is in His hands.
H.Pf. What is signified by the golden crown? It says, "... one sitting like the Son of man, having upon his head a golden crown", chapter 14:14.
J.T. That would mean that it is *of God* , on One *like*
{448}
the Son of man -- personally qualified to wear it. The elders of chapter 4 have golden crowns, also white garments; the Person here sits on a *white* cloud and has a golden crown.
F.S.C. Will you say a word about the volume of blood?
J.T. It shows what is coming. "The wine-press was trodden without the city, and blood went out of the wine-press to the bits of the horses for a thousand six hundred stadia", (@Revelation 14:20). It is the idea of immense slaughter. It is a remarkable allusion to God's abhorrence of sin, expressed in judgment. If the sacrifices of old had been brought as prescribed, there would have been one continuous stream of blood, all pointing to the vicarious death of Christ. It is God's testimony continually to what man is as sinful. The continual flow of blood at the tabernacle was a testimony to it sacrificially, so that God could be approached. Now this is not vicarious blood; it is the result of the direct judgment of God on those described, and it is not only the actual persons immediately involved, but as representative of what has historically taken the place of the vine of the earth.
A.N.W. The Lord is discriminative in His use of the winnowing fan, @Matthew 3:12, but not so here with the sickle. Here, it would seem to be universal judgment, and nothing is spared now.
J.T. No; there is no discrimination needed because it is the harvest; it is more than ripe, it is dry. It is really not fit for use.
Now, to confirm all this, chapter 19 directs our view to Christ as a heavenly Warrior. It is most important to get the full drift of this teaching at the present time, because it shows plainly what is coming, and we will be prepared for it in examining these passages. This is a great Warrior coming out from heaven. Heaven is opened. It has been opened several times before. It
{449}
opened on Him; Stephen saw it opened, and it was opened, too, in Ezekiel's day. But now it is opened so that Christ in His full military character should be seen. "And I saw the heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and one sitting on it, called Faithful and True, and he judges and makes war in righteousness. And his eyes are a flame of fire, and upon his head many diadems, having a name written which no one knows but himself; and he is clothed with a garment dipped in blood; and his name is called The Word of God. And the armies which are in the heaven followed him upon white horses, clad in white, pure, fine linen. And out of his mouth goes a sharp two-edged sword, that with it he might smite the nations; and he shall shepherd them with an iron rod; and he treads the wine-press of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty. And he has upon his garment, and upon his thigh, a name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords", verses 11 - 16. There can be no question as to who this is. To my mind, it is affecting that the Spirit of God gives us here so many appellations of Christ, and such a description so that we should have Him in our hearts as a great Military Personage coming out of heaven to deal with all opposition here below.
J.T.Jr. Is this an extension of the thought in @Exodus 15 -- the Lord is a Man of war?
J.T. Quite so; His Deity is guarded in a remarkable way in this passage; He has a name written that no one knows but Himself. "The Word of God" is a public name. He is called the "Word of God", but the name written that no one knows but Himself implies inscrutability -- a most important matter to have always before us.
W.R. Would it be right to say all that we have had as to the coming of the Lord would promote a state in us of righteousness, faithfulness, and purity?
J.T. Yes; and that we should be on God's side in
{450}
view of all that is current in the world just now. What marks the Warrior in heaven is that He is faithful and true, and He judges and makes war in righteousness. It is remarkable that the white horse is mentioned *first* . Such a horse carries Him.
J.S. Is the thought of strength seen in the thigh? He is not weakened here as Jacob was.
J.T. Quite so; there is no weakening of His strength.
A.R. Does the name written which no one knows but Himself, refer to His Deity?
J.T. Yes; only the Father knows. It is inscrutability. "The Word of God" is not that. There are those who would say that the Word is His name in pre-incarnate Deity, but it is not. The "Word of God" is a public name; it is what He is as revealing the mind of God.
J.S. He is inscrutable as to His own Person.
J.T. That is the thought; it makes us worshipful of Him.
W.B-w. In @Philippians 2:9, it says, "God highly exalted him, and granted him a name, that which is above every name",. What does that name refer to?
J.T. That is renown. It is a question of the renown that He has: "... that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow", (@Philippians 2:10). *Jesus* represents it there, but the word *name* by itself is renown. It is the renown He has acquired in redemption as having become Man.
W.B-w. You do not connect that with inscrutability, then?
J.T. No; it is public -- what you bow to, as known.
C.A.M. That would be included in the thought of the "many diadems", would it not?
J.T. Quite so; His personal greatness and prowess, in war and otherwise, enters into these diadems.
A.P.T. As we follow Christ coming out of heaven, we shall have an inward sense in our souls of His Deity.
J.T. I think so. We shall always have that. We
{451}
should have it now, too. And we shall have white horses. That is the word here to us. The army following has white horses.
A.P.T. The teaching which the Lord is bringing before us in relation to what is to come would endear Him to our affections now.
J.T. That is the point of the instruction. It culminates in our saying to Him, Come. "The Spirit and the bride say. Come". All this enters into that. Being His companions in war does not lessen our affection for Him, but rather increases it, because He retains His personality always. He is as lovable in war as in peace. We are told about David as he appeared before Goliath that he was "ruddy, and besides of a lovely countenance (@1 Samuel 16:12)". He retained his personal attractiveness, as Jonathan's devotion would also show.
J.T.Jr. We are told that the Lord became angry, and did not Moses go out from Pharaoh in a glowing anger? He was no less, personally, even though angry.
J.T. Moses was said to be very great at that point, @Exodus 11:3. He became very great.
A.P.T. The last chapter we read would really precede the others as to its effect upon our spirits.
J.T. We have been engaged with what is largely military, but He says, "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things", chapter 22:16. *"I* Jesus" -- that is His personal name. It is intended to affect our hearts. *"I* Jesus" is personality in manhood. All that He has testified culminates in this expression. Every one of the testimonies rendered should endear Him to our hearts.
A.R. Does the reference to the Offspring of David relate to what you were saying about David, that He retains His lovableness even in conflict?
J.T. Quite so. The Root, of course, is in keeping with the inscrutable Name. It implies that Christ is God. The title. Offspring of David, would refer to His manhood.
{452}
J.S. In contrast to current events here it says, "And he judges and makes war in righteousness", chapter 19:11. In the world, war is often waged in unrighteousness.
J.T. Quite so. We are called into soldiership, in view of the great war referred to in our chapter, in which we are to ride on white horses. Today we are to be good soldiers of Jesus Christ.
J.S. Knowing Him as He is presented in these scriptures would help us to be in power in present testimony.
J.T. That is what is intended. There is blessedness attached to the reading of this book, chapter 1:3. The final word which the Lord is endeavouring to bring us into is, *"I* am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star. And the Spirit and the bride say. Come", @Revelation 22:16,17. And then the extension of that is, "And let him that hears say. Come. And let him that is athirst come; he that will, let him take the water of life freely", verse 17. And it goes on to say, "He that testifies these things says. Yea, I come quickly. Amen; come. Lord Jesus", (@Revelation 22:20). That is a wonderful finish to this book. The saints are brought into it. John himself is speaking, but as representative of those who love the Lord Jesus. "Amen", he says, "come, Lord Jesus".
Ques. How does the expression, "bright and morning star", apply in relation to what is before us?
J.T. It is what Christ is before He appears as the Sun of righteousness. He thus appears to His saints now.
W.R. Would you say a little more as to the Spirit and bride saying. Come, and let him that hears say, come, and him that is athirst come.
J.T. The word "come" is a key. You say. Come, to Christ, and you say. Come, to others; and he that hears says. Come. This "come" enters into the evangelical
{453}
movements of the saints. You say. Come, to Christ because you love Him. You say. Come, to men who are thirsting. It is a corresponding feature in those that love the Lord Jesus, that they say. Come, to others, to take the water of life, which is available.
{454}
THE LORD'S COMING (9)
@Matthew 24:26 - 30,45 - 51; @Matthew 25: 14 - 46; @John 14:1 - 3
J.T. The ground to be covered at this meeting is extensive, and in order to follow, we need to tax our minds and memories as to the scriptures that allude to the Lord's coming, in the four gospels. Matthew's gospel contains the most, and, indeed, covers indirectly those found in Mark and Luke. John's direct references to the Lord's coming are not so numerous. The one read is the most pointed. We have already considered the rapture, to which the verses in John allude. Matthew does not speak of the Lord's ascension, nor does he allude to the rapture directly. He is concerned about the assembly here in the absence of Christ, and in treating of the Lord's coming he has the continuance of the testimony in mind until that event, from the time that the Lord began to minister; whether it be the testimony rendered by the apostles in relation to the Jews at the beginning of the dispensation, their testimony in relation to the assembly, or the testimony that will be rendered in view of the millennium, after the assembly is taken to heaven.
Matthew has in mind the continuance of the testimony to the end. There is no break in it; it goes right on to what is called "the completion of the age" @Matthew 28:20; that is, the age to which the law and the prophets referred, and into which Christ came. The apostles had part in it, and others like them will be raised up in the last days after the assembly is removed. The first direct reference is in chapter 7: "Not every one who says to me. Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he that does the will of my Father who is in the heavens. Many shall say to me in that day. Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied through thy name, and through *thy*
{455}
name cast out demons, and through *thy* name done many works of power? and then will I avow unto them, I never knew you. Depart from me, workers of lawlessness", @Matthew 7:21 - 23. In chapter 10 He alludes to the apostles¬ service to Israel and says, "But when they persecute you in this city, flee to the other; for verily I say to you. Ye shall not have completed the cities of Israel until the Son of man be come", @Matthew 10:23. That is, he contemplates their ministry going on in the cities of Israel -- confining themselves to Israel -- until the Son of man comes. These scriptures are important as throwing light on Matthew's point of view.
Then, in chapter 11, the Lord refers to His testimony in Galilee, and speaks of the judgment that will ensue upon most of the cities where His mighty works were done; chapter 12 brings out the clean break between Him and the Jews. Chapter 13 is a new sowing for a new crop; hence we have the Lord's coming - called "the completion of the age" @Matthew 13:9 -- contemplated in the parables of the tares, and in that of the fish. The testimony is viewed as going on to the end when He send His angels to take out of His kingdom what offends; it is not His coming for His assembly, but to take out of His *kingdom* what offends. Then we have the assembly itself introduced in chapter 16, and the Lord speaks about the Son of man coming in His kingdom, which is seen peculiarly in chapter 17, on the mount of Transfiguration.
The chapters from which we read, I think, may be used to enlarge on these remarks, because they are the Lord's own point of view as to His coming. They contemplate the circumstances through which the testimony will pass as continuing until the Son of man comes. Chapter 24 is a direct prophetic statement by the Lord covering the whole period bearing on the testimony to the Jews; and then chapter 25 is more the moral side, bringing in the ten virgins and the talents,
{456}
and the Lord sitting on the throne of His glory in view of setting up the millennium, and the part the nations have in it. I make these remarks so that the brethren may have in mind an outline of the truth as it is before us at this time.
F.H.L. Is it of interest to see that the light of chapters 24 and 25 comes out as He is sitting on the Mount of Olives? It seems to be an inside position; the disciples came to Him privately.
J.T. Well, it is suggestive of the Spirit -- the spiritual side of His position. From there He tells them what is going to happen in relation to the then existent state of things at Jerusalem. The passage says, "And Jesus went forth and went away from the temple, and his disciples came to him to point out to him the buildings of the temple. And he answering said to them. Do ye not see all these things? Verily I say to you. Not a stone shall be left here upon a stone which shall not be thrown down", @Matthew 24:1,2. His position on the mount of Olives would indicate that the new order of things would be spiritual; no longer a matter of the law and prophets and Judaism, but a new spiritual order of things.
A.N.W. Would you make a little more clear, where the assembly and its ministry fit into that period?
J.T. Well, this chapter hardly provides for that. We have to go back in the teaching of the book for that. Chapter 13 introduces the ministry that belongs to the assembly. Here, the Lord is giving instruction as to His coming, but it is to His Jewish disciples, or apostles. He is instructing them, but He says nothing about the assembly period in this prophetic announcement. It is their ministry in relation to Jerusalem. Luke tells us that Jerusalem is to be destroyed and the Jews shall be led captive in all nations until the times of the nations be fulfilled, but Matthew does not put it that way. The Lord is instructing them as to their then position and what should follow, including the destruction of the
{457}
temple; what they should suffer in relation to it. He does not speak of the great parenthesis of the ministry of the assembly; that was committed to Paul; it is not touched on here, but we understand from other scriptures that it ensues during all these centuries during which the Spirit of God has been operating in relation to the assembly. Presently, as the assembly is translated to heaven, the testimony will again revert to the Jews, so that Jerusalem is the centre of these instructions.
A.P.T. Does this connect in any way with @Revelation 7 -- the one hundred forty-four thousand out of Israel and the great number who come out of the great tribulation?
J.T. The first thing mentioned there is the holding up of the winds, so that "the bondmen of our God" (@Revelation 7:3) should be sealed -- persons that were to *serve* . Undoubtedly they would be used to evangelise the nations; "these glad tidings of the kingdom" the Lord says, "shall be preached in the whole habitable earth, for a witness to all the nations", (@Matthew 24:14). That is not exactly the gospel that the apostles preached as recorded in the Acts, nor what Paul preached to the nations. The twelve, at least those who will correspond to them, after the assembly is taken up to heaven, will be used to evangelise the nations, and the immense multitude mentioned in @Revelation 7 will, no doubt, be the fruit of their service.
A.N.W. So that, whilst the Bridegroom is in view in @Matthew 25, the bride is not in sight; but are we right in placing ourselves amongst the virgins?
J.T. The parable of the virgins refers to Christianity; it is a question of *all* going forth; the allusion is to those who, professedly, form the assembly; half of them do not have the Spirit, and hence they are not ready to go in with the Lord to the marriage. Matthew, almost invariably, leaves the idea of the bride open; he stresses the idea of the Bridegroom.
W.R. Would you say that during the Lord's absence
{458}
all service is to be carried on in the power of the Spirit? The Lord said in @Acts 1:8, "ye will receive power, the Holy Spirit having come upon you, and ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth",.
J.T. Yes. All testimony was to be in the power of the Spirit. There will be a great testimony raised up after the assembly is taken to heaven, but not in the same heavenly power as the ministry carried on under Paul. It will be the testimony going out from the Jews to the nations as a witness, as the Lord says here.
A.B.P. Is the assembly seen in Matthew as the true Rebecca who occupies Sarah's tent? In that sense, the earth is not her true position, but she is occupying the place of another in testimony?
J.T. That is a good way to put it. It was testimony; Sarah's tent was not the final position for Rebecca; she is there in testimony because Sarah has died. So that the assembly in Matthew occupies the position of Israel until the time for Israel to be restored, and she is regarded as trustworthy, because in chapter 18 it is said, "... tell it to the assembly", (@Matthew 18:17) and if one does not listen to the assembly he is to be regarded as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer. "Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven", (@Matthew 18:18) would show that she is trusted.
A.B.P. Is there also the thought that the testimony is going through to culminate in glory?
J.T. The "end" in Matthew is generally the millennium, so that I think the identity of the bride is purposely left open. It may be the assembly, or the earthly bride according to the Song of Solomon. Now, it is the assembly, but when the assembly is taken to heaven, the bride of the Song of Solomon comes in, and @Revelation 14 indicates that it is composed of the one hundred forty-four thousand, that are with the Lamb on mount Zion.
{459}
C.A.M. You emphasise the point that Matthew stresses the Bridegroom -- the masculine side - rather than the bride. In view of the fact that this gospel does not record the Lord's ascension, it would be impossible to bring in the rapture, as we call it.
J.T. Quite so; He is not seen as in heaven -- "Behold, *I* am with you all the days", (@Matthew 28:20). He is seen as with the saints.
C.A.M. Would this not be an answer to Rebecca's question, "Who is the man?" (@Genesis 24:65)?
J.T. Well, Matthew leaves us in no doubt as to who *He* is. The stress is on the male side in Matthew. More is made of Joseph than of Mary in Matthew, whereas more is made of Mary by Luke. Matthew begins with, "Book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham @Matthew 1:1". It clearly sets out who the man is.
W.B-w. Does the expression, "the completion of the age" @Matthew 28:20 in chapters 13 and 24, and in the last verse of this book, characterise the gospel, corresponding largely with Daniel's reference to the time of the end?
J.T. Yes, Daniel stresses *days* , pointing to experience -- the number of days to be gone through -- but "the completion of the age" (@Matthew 28:20) alludes to a period characterised in a special way. Really, the allusion is to the period of the law, into which Christ came, as we read in Galatians, "come under law". The apostles were taken up under the law, and they ministered to those who were of the circumcision, according to the Acts, and that ministry will be carried on again. So that the first allusion to their ministry is in chapter 10, where the Lord says, "Ye shall not have completed the cities of Israel until the Son of man be come"; @Matthew 10:23 showing that the primary thought is ministry to Israel. In @Matthew 25 it is more the ministry to the nations by the brethren
{460}
of Christ; and He regards the nations, according to the way they have treated these messengers -- His brethren. So that there are two ministries; first to Israel exclusively, as the Lord says, "Go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel", (@Matthew 10:6); and then, as chapter 25 contemplates, a wide ministry to all the nations. The nations are tested as to how they have received these messengers.
W.B-w. In chapter 24, it is His coming in relation to Israel; whereas chapter 25 is in relation to the nations?
J.T. Well, in chapter 24 the Lord says, "And these glad tidings of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole habitable earth, for a witness to all the nations", @Matthew 24:14. Whereas, earlier, they are told to go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and they would not have gone over the cities until the Son of man shall have come. You can see there are two distinct features of the preaching; the first is in relation to the house of Israel, chapter 10, and the second is by those of the house of Israel as a witness to all nations. And then the final issue is in chapter 25, when the sheep and the goats are distinctly separated; the sheep are those that have received the testimony; they have received and ministered to *His* brethren.
C.A.M. Did you say that chapter 24 is the historical setting and chapter 25 the moral thought?
J.T. I think it is, bringing out the effect of the testimony, first in the virgins and then in the bondmen, and then in the nations that hear the gospel. It is a very full chapter, discriminative and final, too, because it says, "these shall go away into eternal punishment, and the righteous into life eternal", verse 46. That is final for the nations; not all individuals of humanity, but the nations.
A.C. Does that not place the preaching of the Jewish brethren on a very high level, and also raise a serious question with those who refuse it?
J.T. The nations that refuse it will go into everlasting punishment and those that accept it (because it is a
{461}
question of how they receive the messengers or the brethren of Christ) go into everlasting life.
A.C. Would the same principle be applicable to the present dispensation?
J.T. As we get the primary teaching of any section of scripture, we can apply its principles to our own position.
A.R. Has the historic phase of chapter 24 been fulfilled, or does it still wait for fulfilment? It says, "... if those days had not been cut short, no flesh had been saved", @Matthew 24:22.
J.T. That is future. Of course, the apostles and Christians generally had severe persecution, and some would experience much suffering during the destruction of Jerusalem. Thus what is spoken of here has been partially fulfilled, but the complete fulfilment of it is future; it is what is called "Jacob's trouble". It is a tribulation which will be more or less in the confines of Jerusalem and will exceed anything that has ever been, so that the sovereignty of God comes in and shortens it for the sake of the elect.
W.R. Would the testimony rendered to Israel be pre-millennial, and that to the nations, during the millennium?
J.T. Both are pre-millennial. We have the indication of what will happen in @Revelation 7, as we have already remarked; a "great crowd" is seen, out of every nation and tribes and peoples and tongues, such as no one can number. John inquired as to whom they are, and the elders said, "These are they who come out of the great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and have made them white in the blood of the Lamb", @Revelation 7:14. They have been evangelised, so that in @Revelation 14 we have an angel flying in mid-heaven with the everlasting gospel; that would point to rapidity of service; things will be done quickly, because the time will be very short.
{462}
R.W.S. Will it be toward the east?
J.T. I should say so. The book of Revelation shows that the European nations come under judgment; it would therefore be Asiatic and perhaps African nations primarily; those which have not been evangelised. The Scripture says, "to every nation and tribe and tongue and people", (@Revelation 14:6).
H.H. In viewing the testimony in the Acts, is it right to say that it divides itself into two aspects, one which is Jewish, up to Paul, and afterwards, through Paul to the nations?
J.T. Quite so. The twelve were to preach to the nations, but they generally confined themselves to the Jews. According to Galatians, Peter and the other apostles with him went to the circumcision. It is said expressly that they were going to the circumcision, and Paul and those who laboured with him, to the nations. In Paul's ministry the assembly comes out in its heavenly character; it is not touched on in this prophecy at all.
In chapter 24, the Lord is on the mount of Olives; He has left the temple; that order of things is definitely left. It says, "And Jesus went forth and went away from the temple", @Matthew 24:1. That is a form of words you get in chapter 16, in view of the assembly. He left the scribes and Pharisees and went away; it is a definite break with them, and now it is a definite break with the material temple, and He is seated on the mount of Olives. Verse 3 says, "And as he was sitting upon the mount of Olives the disciples came to him privately, saying. Tell us, when shall these things be, and what is the sign of thy coming and the completion of the age?" @Matthew 24:3 That verse gives the clue to the whole matter. There are certain ones who want to know something, and that is the secret of getting light. You get many instances in the gospel of persons who inquire, and the disciples, in this chapter, want to know. The Lord is in the position
{463}
to tell them; it is not here a question of their services in the assembly, but just what they ask. They had come to Him previously to point out to Him the buildings of the temple. "And he answering said to them. Do ye not see all these things? Verily I say to you. Not a stone shall be left here upon a stone (@Matthew 24:2)". But in verse 3, they came to Him privately saying, "Tell us, when shall these things be, and what is the sign of thy coming and the completion of the age?" @Matthew 24:3 If we all had such desire we should get wonderful light. We get a little, of course, at these meetings, but we would get far more if every one were asking questions in his heart and looking into his Bible before coming.
C.B. There would thus be a purifying of ourselves as He is pure.
J.T.Jr. The Pharisees and Sadducees stand over against the attitude of the disciples. They were not inquiring, but opposing. Does not the spirit of the Pharisees and Sadducees hinder an inquiring spirit?
J.T. In answer to their inquiry, the Lord says, in verse 4, "See that no one mislead you @Matthew 24:4". That is, there are those who inquire about prophecy as they would about signs; they never get any real light about it. The moral side must come in first. Am I adjusted in my soul about the matter? So the Lord says. See that no one mislead you. Look out for yourselves. Are you ready for light? Are you morally clear? If it is a mere matte of inquiry, it is nothing. See how very many of the Lord's people are misled at the present time; right inquiry is lacking, and therefore He says, "See that no one mislead you. For many shall come in my name, saying, *I* am the Christ (@Matthew 24:4,5)". That is the first point. The Lord pays great attention to inquiries where people are ready to be adjusted morally, but investigation of prophecy will not help us, unless we are morally adjusted.
A.R. In chapter 13, in the parables, the Lord speaks
{464}
of secret evil in the case of the woman who hid leaven in the meal, and the whole thing became leavened; but here He is dealing more with apostasy in relation to Israel, would you say?
J.T. Quite so. Chapter 13 deals with Christianity -- the sowing for a new crop and how it became corrupted, but this is a testimony in its relation to the age into which the Lord came, and in connection with which Jerusalem stood. This is to show that the testimony stands in relation to that, and in the last days there will be results; there will be *completion* . The Son of man will come in His glory, sitting upon His throne. That means that He will take up matters definitely with a view to final adjustment both as to the nations and in regard to everyone, because the passage carries right on to eternal punishment. In chapter 13 the wicked are mentioned as cast into the furnace of fire, where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
J.S. Matthew presenting Him as Son of man would be the universal bearing?
J.T. Quite so; Matthew brings that title in much because he wishes to show that the testimony is going outside of Israel. The messengers first will confine themselves to Israel, according to chapter 10, but according to this chapter they go out to all the nations, so that there is a basis for the millennial state of things. The millennium requires that. There is the gospel to every man now, and that involves the heavenly portion for the assembly; but here we are dealing with the position of Jerusalem and the testimony as it stands in relation to that age, and how God will resume His relations with Israel presently, and then the final issue, both as to Israel and the nations as such.
F.H.L. So that we can understand the Lord's comment as to Israel: "Ye shall in no wise see me henceforth until ye say. Blessed be he that comes in the name of the Lord", (@Matthew 23:39).
{465}
J.T. Just so. Now, we must go on to the second important part of this chapter; the question *of food* . In verse 45 we come to a person whom the Lord regards as a "faithful and prudent bondman", so that now we are on the moral side again; the position of service in the absence of Christ, in relation to His house; that is, to the saints; so that He says: "Blessed is that bondman whom his lord on coming shall find doing thus. Verily I say unto you, that he will set him over all his sub-stance. But if that evil bondman should say in his heart. My lord delays to come, and begin to beat his fellow bondmen, and eat and drink with the drunken, the lord of that bondman shall come in a day when he does not expect it, and in an hour he knows not of, and shall cut him in two and appoint his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth", verses 46 - 51. I thought it was right to touch on this because it refers to our own position now, as of His household, in the absence of Christ. It is a question of how to minister a portion of meat to the saints. He sets His bondman over His household to give them food in season or, Luke says, "the measure of corn @Luke 12:42".
Ques. What is the difference between the disciple and the bondman? You mentioned that the disciples made inquiry. What is the difference?
J.T. A disciple is one who learns from his master and follows him; so the Lord says, "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves", (@John 13:35). A bondman has an owner; he is not his own, "Do ye not know that ye are not your own, for ye have been bought with a price", (1 Corinthians 6:19). As a bondman you cannot use your will; you are to be entirely at the will of another; that, I think, is the reason why the Lord uses the word *bondman* ; it is very much used in scripture, particularly in the book of Revelation. A bondman cannot be a freelance; whatever His expressed will is, you obey.
{466}
W.B-w. Are you applying this verse to our dispensation -- the assembly now being His household?
J.T. Yes. Verse 43 says, "But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief was coming, he would have watched and not have suffered his house to be dug through into. Wherefore *ye* also, be ye ready, for in that hour that ye think not the Son of man comes. Who then is the faithful and prudent bondman?" @Matthew 24:43 - 45. That is, the coming of the Lord is viewed as the coming of a thief; he does not say when it will happen. So it will be in the last days amongst the repenting Jews; the Lord will have His bondmen then, too, but it has its direct application to us now in the absence of the Lord. He needs trustworthiness in those who serve, that they furnish food in season.
W.B-w. Matthew gives it an assembly touch in that way.
J.T. I think we can understand that the household would be that now.
C.A.M. Would it be right to say that it extends to the completion of the age? Yet, the moral feature in all that period is known in reality in the assembly.
J.T. These gospels are written to the assembly. The whole of the New Testament, including the book of Revelation, is written to the assembly, so that we are supposed to know all, and if we know it, we can make application where it fits.
J.S. What do you understand by food in season?
J.T. I think it works out in the way you serve, such as giving an address. You calculate what is suitable. Paul says as to his service at Corinth, "For I did not judge it well to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and *him* crucified", @1 Corinthians 2:2. He eliminated other things for the moment and confined himself to the line of truth that was particularly needed.
W.R. It all tends to produce bridal affections in the saints.
{467}
J.T.Jr. Would it also apply in @1 Corinthians 14? Each is said to have a psalm or teaching, whatever it may be; there has been exercise in the person before the saints come together, for food must be ministered; somebody has to minister it.
J.T. And you understand the God of measure, that everything is measured. You measure an address, for instance. I was thinking, at the beginning of this meeting, how time enters into service. God Himself was the first to use time; He worked by the day. The Lord alludes to twelve hours in the day. We have a comparatively short time in a meeting like this, so that if we proceed on the line of measure, we try to get all possible into it; not to waste time. And then what are you going to bring into it in the way of ministry? What is needed? So that we read, "each of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation (@1 Corinthians 14:26)". Let it come out as you have opportunity.
G.H. Matthew speaks much of the idea of the hour. Does it give the idea of what is compressed?
J.T. Yes. I think it would be helpful for us to bear that in mind. Our meetings are short; the point is to make the best use of them. The God of measure implies that.
Now, to proceed, we should look into chapter 25, as to the Bridegroom coming. The virgins all went forth to meet Him, we are told, and they are all called virgins. The word *virgin* is to be taken here in its context; it does not necessarily mean a real Christian; it may be only a professing Christian, and he is terribly exposed if he is that, because he is left outside; he never gets in to where the Lord is. Verse 5 says, "Now the bridegroom tarrying, they all grew heavy and slept. But in the middle of the night there was a cry. Behold, the bridegroom; go forth to meet him @Matthew 25:5,6". The word *cometh* , which appears in the Authorised Version, should not be
{468}
there; it is a question of the Person of Christ, that *He* is visible in this sense. "Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their torches. And the foolish said to the prudent. Give us of your oil, for our torches are going out. But the prudent answered saying. We cannot, lest it might not suffice for us and for you. Go rather to those that sell, and buy for yourselves. But as they went away to buy, the bridegroom came (@Matthew 25:7 - 10)". That is the solemn side of this parable. Persons often trifle and think everything is optional, assuming that they can get the oil when they want it! But they cannot! The process of getting it is rather lengthy, and if you have left it negligently, you do not get the oil at all; so that the passage says, "But as they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and the ones that were ready went in with him to the wedding feast, and the door was shut. Afterwards came also the rest of the virgins, saying. Lord, Lord, open to us; but he answering said. Verily I say unto you, I do not know you", @Matthew 25:10 - 12. This is a word for negligent persons, who think that having to do with God and Christ and the assembly is an optional matter, but it is not; if you make it that you may be left out for ever.
Ques. Who are these foolish virgins today?
J.T. Professing persons without the Spirit; persons who are not really converted at all, and yet they pass muster as virgins. It is a most solemn matter. It is in the process of procuring the oil that they miss getting in. It is put in such language that it is unmistakable. It is not that they are made out to be wicked persons, exactly, but they are left outside, and never get in. It is because of their negligence and light-heartedness. They typify those who have not gone in for what is vital when they should have done so. The five foolish virgins get the terrible word from the Lord, "Verily I say unto you, I do not know you (@Matthew 25:12)".
J.H.E. The oil is something you have to buy.
{469}
J.T. Quite so; you must get the oil. The Lord's word to Laodicea is that He was ready to give counsel in such cases; but that does not come in here; this is to show the terrible result of carelessness in the profession of Christ.
W.R. Is that not also seen in verse 49 of the previous chapter -- "My lord delays to come"?
J.T. In this chapter it is that the virgins have been careless concerning the oil. They have not the Spirit; they have not gone through the process, so to speak, of obtaining the oil.
A.B.P. Would the exhortation, "make your calling and election sure", (@2 Peter 1:10), apply here?
J.T. Yes, it would. Certain ones have gone forth to meet the Bridegroom, professedly, but have fallen asleep. That is a serious matter. The ones who had the oil fell asleep, too, but they recovered themselves. He who has the Spirit will recover himself; he will adjust himself and get right in time, but he that does not have the Spirit will not get right at all; he will miss the whole matter and be shut out from the Bridegroom for ever.
A.R. Paul said, when he went to Ephesus, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed"? (@Acts 19:2), and later he writes, "Wake up, thou that sleepest, and arise up from among the dead", (@Ephesians 5:14).
J.S. Is there not great need to cultivate acquaintance with Christ? The word here is, "I do not know you (@Matthew 25:12)". Is that not serious?
J.T. It is a dreadful thing; a most solemn thing, and yet they are called virgins, though foolish ones. They are taken on at face value and the name given to them, but they are not real. What has been remarked should be enlarged upon a little: "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?" (@Acts 19:2). Well, they say, "We did not even hear if the Holy Spirit was come(@Acts 19:2)". This does not mean that they did not know

there was such a Person as the Holy Spirit; they did not know He had actually come. It is a similar expression to @John 7:39 "the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified",. The Holy Spirit was then available, but the men at Ephesus did not know that and had not received Him. The apostle Paul acquainted them with the fact that the ministry of John the baptist did not go on to Christianity proper. He preached Christ to them, and in his epistle later he alludes to it, saying, "in whom *ye* also have trusted, having heard the word of the truth (@Ephesians 1:13)". He had preached the truth to them about Christ; "the glad tidings of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is the earnest of our inheritance to the redemption of the acquired possession to the praise of his glory", (@Ephesians 1:13,14). I only wanted to call attention to Paul's inquiry at the beginning, and also to the "word of the truth". It is what believers so much need in order to get the Spirit; that is, to get the adjustment in their souls. The word of truth adjusts us as to wrong things which we may have imbibed for years and which may prevent us from coming into Christianity in the true sense. It is the word of truth we need, the gospel of our salvation, but the word of truth first.
J.H.E. It is noticeable that many in the profession say, "Lord", but Paul says, "no one can say. Lord Jesus, unless in the power of the Holy Spirit", (@1 Corinthians 12:3).
J.T. That is the true way to say it. We say it in testimony rightly when we get the Holy Spirit.
C.B. Is it not mercy that the opportunity is still open for souls to go to those who sell and get this oil?
J.T. Quite so; but the parable would show that even if you do go, as the Bridegroom comes, you will be too late and hence shut out. You have been neglectful. The Lord says, "I do not know you,(@Matthew 25:12)" meaning that you *have never had a transaction with Him* . That is what
{471}
He means. It is not that He does not know *everybody* in one sense, but His implication is. You have never had a transaction with Me or I would have known you.
A.R.S. These foolish virgins may be similar to people to whom the Lord did not commit Himself in the end of @John 2. They believed on Him, but He did not commit Himself to them.
J.T. Very much like that; they were not trustworthy; not genuine.
A.R. You spoke of having a transaction with the Lord. In John 7:37 He says, "If any one thirst, let him come to me and drink",. Is that the idea of such a transaction?
J.T. If you have had a transaction with Him, He knows you.
A.B.P. We are told, "The Lord knows those that are his", (@2 Timothy 2:19).
J.T. Just so; who can afford not to have a transaction with Christ? Persons may have had any number of transactions with other people, but never had one with Christ, to get the blessing from Him.
C.A.M. The last church transaction seems to be, "Buy of me". That is the last opportunity.
J.T. Quite so. There is remarkable grace in the Lord's word to Laodicea.
A.P.T. "I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine", (@John 10:14).
J.T. Just so; it is a wonderful thing to know the Lord in this way; to have had dealings with Him and settled everything with Him.
J.T.Jr. The fact that the foolish virgins say, "Give us of your oil, (@Matthew 25:8)" would seem to indicate that they did not know *how* to get it.
J.T. They did not know where to get it. It is a transaction with Christ. You cannot get it from the saints. Although the Holy Spirit is here on earth in the assembly, you must go to the Lord to receive the Spirit.
{472}
The idea of the talents is very suggestive. It is a great matter, for the Lord's substance is in mind. He says, "it is as if a man going away out of a country called his own bondmen and delivered to them his substance", verse 14. Of course, we translate this into the fact that the Lord has gone into heaven, but that is not exactly Matthew's way of putting things. It is the viewpoint of a man going away out of his own country where he was labouring. He "delivered to them his substance"; not part of it. It is put as if all of his substance were in mind. He is trusting his bondmen to use it aright. So it says, "To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to each according to his particular ability, and immediately went away out of the country", verse 15. We are well acquainted with the parable, but I think it would be well to have in mind that it is a question of the Lord's substance. The word "talent" represents a very large denomination. It is not a pound, as in Luke, where it is a comparatively small denomination, and where each also gets the same amount. Here, it is distributed according to the ability of each.
J.T.Jr. Is Matthew marked by severity -- the things committed being so great that the Lord shows His severity in the judgment of the one who failed to trade with the talent given him?
J.T. Yes. Matthew is severe. He therefore puts it upon us, if we are bondmen, that the Lord has trusted us with His substance. It is very important therefore, in His mind, because it is His own substance, and He is away out of the country.
E.E.H. Does the responsibility of the bondmen vary?
J.T. Yes; each receives according to his ability, but the first two received the same answers. "He that had received the five talents went and trafficked with them, and made five other talents. In like manner also he that had received the two, he also gained two others. But he
{473}
that had received the one went and dug in the earth and hid the money of his lord". (Notice that it says, "the money *of his lord")* "And after a long time the lord of those bondmen comes and reckons with them. And he that had received the five talents came to him and brought five other talents, saying. My lord, thou deliveredst me five talents; behold, I have gained five other talents besides them. His lord said to him. Well, good and faithful bondman, thou wast faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things: enter into the joy of thy lord", verses 16 - 21. It seems to me we are on a high level of service here. Think of a man getting so much of his lord's money! What an anxiety it would be, so to speak, to the owner of the money. As we realise the value of the talents, we see the meaning of this and what anxiety a man would have in entrusting his bondmen with so much; yet the one who had the most comes forward and shows that he had doubled it. What a joy to his master! He says, "enter into the joy of thy lord". He does not say just what he is to receive, but He does say, "I will set thee over many things", but in the meantime, "enter into the joy of thy lord". In the application, the Lord is giving His servants to understand that He knows they will value that; that they are not mere hirelings; they want to share *His* joy.
A.A.T. That ability that the bondman has is not what we call natural ability, is it?
J.T. It is divinely given; you need a mind; you need a body; a man is a vessel, and God furnishes him with ability in view of the service he is to render.
C.A.M. Paul says to Archippus, "Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, to the end that thou fulfil it", (@Colossians 4:17). Would it be something like that?
J.T. Yes; "to the end that thou fulfil it"; and again to Timothy, "rekindle the gift of God which is in thee", @2 Timothy 1:6.
{474}
A.N.W. Is it not encouraging to see that the one who had the two talents had the same words from the Lord as the one with the five?
J.T. That is why I think we are on a high level here. The Lord is seen as dealing with men who know Him. These two men knew their lord and thought of his joy. What a thing it is for us to be in the joy of *our* Lord! The third man did not know his lord. That is the solemn side. The sorrowful side here is that one undertakes to serve a man he does not know. He thought that he was a hard man.
W.B-w. Such have never been affected by grace.
J.T. They do not know Christ; they have had no personal relations with Him; they mistake Him entirely.
A.B.P. The apostle Paul told Timothy, "Keep ... the good deposit entrusted", but he made the exhortation as one who knew whom he had believed, @2 Timothy 1:12 - 14.
J.T. Quite so; Paul said, "I know whom I have believed" (@2 Timothy 1:12).
Now the final thought is in the Son of man coming in His glory. It seems as if we ought to have this before us. It is the completion of the matter with the nations, the whole adjustment of things in the millennium. "When the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit down upon his throne of glory, and all the nations shall be gathered before him; and he shall separate them from one another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats; and he will set the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on his left", verses 31 - 33. This is what we may call the reconstruction of the world. It is the millennial day. The Lord is putting everything in its place, but He is sitting on the throne of His glory. Think of the magnificence of it! Paul said, "he is going to judge the habitable earth in righteousness by the man whom he has appointed", (@Acts 17:31). That is what this is.
{475}
J.S. Is it the kingdom prepared before the world's foundation that is in view?
J.T. I think it would be worth our while to look into this carefully, because it is finality; the adjustment of the world. We get it in @Revelation 11:15, "The kingdom of the world of our Lord and of his Christ",. In dealing with the present world and adjusting it. He sits upon His throne of glory. He is *sitting* there to do it all. It is a deliberate matter, and you have finality; the "sheep", or righteous, go into everlasting life, and the "goats" into everlasting punishment; it is final.
W.B-w. In chapter 24 the Son of man is spoken of as coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory, but in chapter 25, He is sitting on the throne of *glory* .
J.T. Sitting is an attitude of deliberateness, but think of the environment, the glorious presentation of the position, the throne of His glory!
J.T.Jr. There are no limitations to this throne. There is no Parliament or Congress to depend upon for laws or support. He has power to deal with things and effect everything immediately.
J.T. It is well to keep our minds on finality, how the Lord has a way of doing things, so that there is a final adjustment of everything.
A.R. His present position is on His Father's throne, that would be different.
J.T. That is the throne *of grace* . @Matthew 25 speaks of His own throne of glory. He says of the overcomer in Laodicea, "to him will I give to sit with me in my throne" (@Revelation 3:21); so if overcomers, we share in this.
A.P.T. They do not seem to know why they are blessed.
J.T. It is a question of how you treat the Lord's servants or His brethren, because if you treat them rightly, that shows *you* are right; you are a subject of the work of God.
{476}
A.P.T. It is in a sense automatic -- the expression of what the person is.
G.H. What is the thought of all the angels being with Him?
J.T. Think *of all* the angels! You get in @Revelation 7:1 that "all the angels stood around the throne" in relation to the multitude whom no one could number. *All* the angels are there also. These facts bring out their interest in what God is doing.
J.S. And the Son of man is none less than the King: "Then shall the King say to those on his right hand", verse 34.
{477}
THE LORD'S COMING (10)
@Isaiah 6:1 - 7; @Isaiah 8:13 - 20, @Isaiah 9:6,7; @Psalm 2:1 - 12
J.T. The suggestion has been made to look at the Old Testament in proceeding with our subject at this reading and the following one. The scriptures read have been selected because they furnish the moral side of our subject -- how a believer comes into the light and understanding of the prophetic ministry. Isaiah had written five chapters, and no doubt had carried on a partly oral ministry, before he tells us, in chapter 6, how he came into the light, seeing the Lord on the throne -- "sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple", verse 1. He saw the seraphim standing above Him, celebrating His holiness; that is, the angelic ministers were attending; and Isaiah was converted; convicted of sin; not only realising that he was a sinner, but that the people were, too. So that the chapter furnishes us with the moral side, which is most essential, if we are to enter into the actual prophetic ministry. It is not a mere academic matter; it is moral. God would speak to us in unfolding things to come, unfolding the truth of the Lord's return, as in the prophets; that is, the Lord's return in relation to the Jews, His earthly people, and the nations. I thought the Psalms should be brought into the subject on the same line, that is, from the experimental viewpoint. The Psalms are experimental and run concurrently with the prophetic ministry. So the Old Testament is subdivided into the Law and the Prophets and the Psalms. The Lord would give us an impression such as Isaiah had of seeing the Lord, in view of His coming glory, high and lifted up, sitting upon a throne and His train filling the temple. The relation of the
{478}
temple is important -- the whole millennial order of things will be introduced on these lines.
A.R. Does chapter 6 lay the foundation in Isaiah's soul for his prophecy about the Lord's coming? He really goes right on to the end of the book in referring to the Lord's coming, does he not?
J.T. That is how the matter stands. John, in chapter 12 of his gospel, alludes to this and says, "These things said Esaias because he saw his glory and spoke of him", @John 12:41.
C.A.M. Would it be right to say that that is why the Lord is stressing prophetic ministry and the temple today?
J.T. I think so; the place the temple has in Revelation would help us in relation to the prophetic ministry. John, as we have previously noticed, eats the little book, and it is sweet in his mouth but bitter in his stomach. And he is told he must prophesy again; that is, as appropriating the thing -- assimilating the moral effect -- we are qualified to continue the prophetic ministry, having a sense of the holiness of the position as suggested here. It is a magnificent display. It is the Lord Jesus, really, as He will appear in the kingdom and in the temple presently. His train will fill the temple.
C.H.H. Does Malachi take up the moral side? He says, "the Lord whom ye seek will suddenly come to his temple, and the Angel of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he cometh, saith Jehovah of hosts. But who shall endure the day of his coming? And who shall stand when he appeareth?" @Malachi 3:1,2.
J.T. That is the same thought. We have in mind to take up the post-captivity prophets who prophesied in relation to a remnant, at the next reading, and, of course, Malachi is one of them; so that the line will run into it. The book of Isaiah is the first and greatest of the pre-captivity prophets, who stand in relation to the
{479}
whole people as still owned of God, and hence the increased responsibility. And so we have the allusion to Uzziah, "In the year of the death of king Uzziah", verse 1. He reigned fifty-two years, having become a leper during his reign; pointing no doubt to what largely marked kingship in responsible Israel. Some six kings reigned in the northern kingdom of Israel while Uzziah reigned in Judah, and they were all bad -- three of them were murderers, showing the terrible conditions that marked responsible royalty; and as over against all that, we have the true King here, "the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple". The seraphic ministers were celebrating His holiness as they would be impressed with it in regard to the coming of the Lord and how He would appear. What manner of people ought we to be in view of all this!
C.A.M. In connection with the coming of the Lord, there will be the side of the afflicting of their souls on the part of the Jews, but then will there not be the appearing apart from the question of sin?
J.T. You refer to @Hebrews 9:28, which reads, "thus the Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear to those that look for him the second time without sin for salvation",. That is, He has settled the matter of sin vicariously. He does not come again to do that, but He will come with the moral side of the truth, enforcing it on the consciences of the people, for He will find the Jews having returned to the land in a very low state, and will have to deal with them, which He will do. There will be ministers raised up, according to Matthew, to go over the cities of Israel, so that conviction will be brought to them. I think we see that here; first, Isaiah is convicted as a man of unclean lips and dwelling in the midst of a people of unclean lips That is the first thing -- the general state and conviction as to it.
{480}
C.A.M. So that they will be brought into accord with His death, morally, and be ready for that glorious matter of seeing Him, apart from the question of sin.
J.T. The thought of atonement is in our chapter also, because the altar is there, and the seraph takes the coal with the tongs and touches Isaiah's lips That is the idea of suffering being brought home to them, for it is a *glowing* coal -- and the seraph uses the tongs. But there is no mitigation of its touch as it reaches the lips of the sinner. He has to feel the keenness of the judgment of God as applied to him. Believers are generally weak in regard to this matter. People say they got blessing, their sins forgiven, and so on, without any sense of the keenness of the judgment -- what God's judgment of sin is, whereas it touches the lips of the prophet as a glowing coal.
C.N. Do you suggest that the same effect which is produced on Isaiah by this appearing will be wrought out in the remnant to come?
J.T. That is what is in mind; so that Isaiah confesses his own sin and uncleanness as well as that of the people. He dwelt among a *people* of unclean lips What has he to face? If they do not judge themselves as he is doing, they will persecute him.
A.R. What is implied in the thought of the lips?
J.T. I think they are the vehicle of spoken sin. The Lord says, "Who do men say that I the Son of man am?" @Matthew 16:13. "With their tongues they have used deceit; asps¬ poison is under their lips: whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness", @Romans 3:13,14. Whereas on the other hand, "the priest's lips should keep knowledge", (@Malachi 2:7). We all know what the tongue and the lips are as the vocal powers of man; Satan has hold of them; what evil converse goes on! Here there is a full testimony to holiness. It says, "And one called to the other and said. Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah of hosts", verse 3. We have the Lord
{481}
announced as holy, in the gospels and in Revelation too; and here we have thrice holy, which I should think would be the seraphic estimate of the position; the complete estimate. It is not judicial, which would be cherubic, but seraphic; it indicates the deep understanding they have of the Deity. It is more the subjective side in the ministry; the feeling they have of holiness in the Person. The gift of the Holy Spirit is to enable us to correspond in our service.
A.R. In 2 Thessalonians the man of sin will sit in the temple and say he is God. The Lord is here seen in it, His train filling the temple; but with the man of sin there will be no seraphic attendants.
J.T. The very opposite; he is the man of *sin* , and yet he is in the temple. I apprehend there will be a temple built by the unrepentant Jews. They will set up a place of worship, and possibly that is the one he will enter into and in which he will sit down. Of course, here it is the temple as owned of God and His train fills it, so that there is no opposition.
A.C. Is there significance in the fact that the prophet calls attention to the time of the death of Uzziah?
J.T. We have just remarked that king Uzziah had reigned fifty-two years. He was a leper part of the time and died a leper. So that he would represent the failure of Israel's royalty in responsibility; how much failure there was attached to it. Contemporary with him, were about six kings in the northern kingdom, and they were all bad men. Four of them were murderers and usurpers, and yet they were responsible kings in Israel. God would call attention to the responsible royalty in Israel. There were, of course, some good kings in Judah, but the whole line in Israel, from Jeroboam, we might say, was bad. Uzziah was a king of the line of David and a good king, but he became inflated in the course of his ministry. His heart was lifted up, and he would take on priestly service in the temple, whereas,
{482}
he was only a king, and he died a leper. It seems significant that Isaiah should call attention to the fact that it was when Uzziah died that he saw the Lord. What a difference there would be! What a contrast! This is what is to enter into the consciences of the remnant -- and ourselves, of course -- so that they will be ready for the millennial reign of Christ. It is going to be a glorious reign, but holiness will mark it. He will be King and Priest; He will have access to the temple. Uzziah, a self-willed man, attempted to enter into the sanctuary where he had no right to enter. He was not a priest; he was only a king, and he became a leper. You can see the great contrast if you compare not only the royal lines of Israel and Judah, but the four monarchies since Nebuchadnezzar: and while they have ruled and have been owned of God, we are to become acquainted with the state of things in men. I mean, we are to observe it and compare it with this glorious appearing of Christ, the real King, and these glorious ministers saying, "Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!" That is the thing that is to enter into the constitution of the remnant in the coming day. It is one of the most important things in our subject, because it is the moral side. It lets us into the matter according to God.
C.H.H. Is there a similar allusion in @Luke 3 as to the persons who were reigning and serving generally in the empire, and then the holy atmosphere seen in the angels in relation to the birth of Christ?
J.T. The latter is very beautiful; it is the same sort of thing; the angel appearing to the shepherds and the multitude of the heavenly host.
W.B-w. The seraphim say that the whole earth is filled with His glory. Does that mean it goes out from the temple to the whole earth?
J.T. In the future, we see that there will be a strong link between the temple and the throne. According to
{483}
Zechariah, He will sit as a Priest on His throne. @Isaiah 6 is future and gives us a wonderful connection between royalty and priesthood in the temple and the service that goes on there, -- thoroughly intelligent and sympathetic service, recognising the holiness of the Person that sits on the throne. Christ is both King and Priest. We see in the Psalms that these features run parallel. In @Psalm 2 the Son is on the throne. "And *I* have anointed my king upon Zion, the hill of my holiness", verse 6. God declared the decree -- the Son is the King. But then in @Psalm 110:4 the Son is the Priest, "Thou art priest for ever after the order of Melchisedek". So He is Priest and King, and the remnant will understand this. It will be an education to them.
A.P.T. Inflation seems to have been current amongst the people of God right down the ages.
J.T. Well, holiness is over against the inflation that marked Uzziah. In the year that he died, this vision was seen by the prophet; and it would remind us that to be preserved from inflation we must recognise holiness and be prepared, through repentance, for the experience of the glowing coal touching the lips.
Now, in chapter 8 we see the Lord in His first coming. If we had time, we could dwell on Immanuel as in chapter 7, but as introduced in manhood here. He is seen in chapter 8 as with the remnant, as He was in the gospels and the Acts. So we have, "Jehovah of hosts, him shall ye sanctify; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread. And he will be for a sanctuary; and for a stone of stumbling, and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel", verses 13,14. That is what happened. They rejected Christ, the stumbling-stone; but He is seen amongst His disciples, and Jehovah is hiding His face from Israel, but the Messiah waits for Him. He says, "Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples", verse 16. That is the position in @Luke 24:50 - 53. It is a Jewish
{484}
position and will reappear as the Lord begins to operate amongst them again. So we have, too, "Behold, I and the children that Jehovah hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel, from Jehovah of hosts, who dwelleth in mount Zion", verse 18. The chapter is prophetic as looking forward to the reappearing of Christ in testimony amongst His own; they are viewed as they were in the gospels and the beginning of Acts as His disciples, and the testimony bound up with them, and the Spirit of Christ waiting for this glorious coming. His appearing again.
A.R. This chapter says that He will be the Rock of offence to both houses of Israel, and Jehovah will hide His face from the house of Jacob. Would both houses of Israel be what is public, really in apostasy, while "the children that Jehovah hath given me", will be the remnant?
J.T. Yes; the remnant as resumed in the coming day. It would be included in thee assembly, as we see in Acts but that is not the teaching here. @Romans 11 shows the remnant of Israel merged in the assembly. Paul says that he was one of the remnant, and it was to him that the mystery was revealed; so the remnant is thoroughly absorbed in the assembly, according to him; but that is not touched on here. Here it is the continuance of the Jewish position as the Lord begins to work with Israel in the future. It is the same remnant. It is looking unto Jehovah, who dwells in mount Zion.
C.A.M. Would you say that the binding up of the testimony and the sealing of the law was because of the way Israel treated Stephen? And was the appearing of the Lord to Paul an opening up of church history that we come into?
J.T. Quite so; Paul was really typical of the remnant, taken up before the time. He got the revelation of the mystery, so that the Jewish remnant was entirely absorbed in the assembly, from that point of view. But
{485}
this passage contemplates it continuing from the Jewish side as still having the testimony; and the Lord will join them, and it is in view of Jehovah's dwelling in mount Zion, not the heavenly side of the position; and of course @Revelation 14 shows that there are one hundred and forty-four thousand with the Lamb. That the mystery should be made known to Paul as one who represents the remnant is very remarkable. He was born out of due time -- before the time -- in view of the Jewish remnant in the future. God takes him up for the heavenly side so that the Jewish remnant is entirely absorbed in the mystery.
C.A.M. Do you look at the binding up of the testimony as a national thing?
J.T. It has Israel in view, but it was among Christ's disciples. God hides His face from the house of Jacob. That is *all* Israel, and Messiah is waiting for Him. It is seen at the end of Luke; the beginning of the Acts looks toward the assembly, it is the same company, but the assembly is in mind. God is continuing on with them as part of the Jewish remnant.
A.P.T. Does @Acts 1 -- the disciples inquiring about the kingdom -- refer to this prophecy?
J.T. Quite so; they ask, "Lord, is it at this time that thou restorest the kingdom to Israel?" He says, "It is not yours to know times or seasons, which the Father has placed in his own authority", @Acts 1:6,7. They are to receive the Spirit, and the time of restoration of the kingdom is left open, so the assembly is in mind in the Lord's words.
A.P.T. Has the fulfilment of what we are considering now been postponed for the moment? Has it been held over in view of the coming in of the Holy Spirit?
J.T. I think so; it was put in abeyance upon the coming in of the Holy Spirit, involving the assembly; only in patience God waited, and Peter spoke on Jewish lines in his earlier addresses. The death of
{486}
Stephen was the finish of that. The taking up of Paul has the Jewish remnant in mind. He says of himself that he is an Israelite of the tribe of Benjamin, yet the fact that he is taken up and the mystery revealed to him, shows how thoroughly the Jewish remnant is absorbed in the assembly; but Christ's disciples in their then character are to reappear again, as we learn in the early chapters of Matthew, "Ye shall not have completed the cities of Israel until the Son of man be come", @Matthew 10:23. The mystery of the assembly is thus a parenthesis, as we have often said; but the Jewish remnant was wholly absorbed in it.
J.T.Jr. Would the blinding of Elymas refer to the nation as such, judicially made blind?
J.T. That is right. The ministry of Paul and Barnabas brings to light the terrible state that Israel had fallen into. Paul says, "Son of the devil, enemy of all righteousness", @Acts 13:10.
W.B-w. Paul does not close the door against the Jews until the last chapter of the Acts.
J.T. That is true; a very important thing to observe, how the mercy of God continued on, but it was not so pronounced at the end as it was in the beginning.
J.T.Jr. Paul alludes to the fact that the Jews would not hear, in @Acts 28. Is that not the point in bringing in this prophecy?
J.T. Quite so. The apostle brings in this very chapter we are speaking of -- @Isaiah 6.
W.B-w. "And they have closed their eyes", it says in @Matthew 13:15. They were blind because they closed their eyes themselves -- deliberately.
C.H.H. You were speaking of the remnant as absorbed in the assembly, and the other side which referred back to the Jewish remnant as such. Would your reference to it in this sense have a moral bearing on the assembly today?
J.T. I think so. This hiding of things and waiting for
{487}
Him would have a bearing, and the word, "Behold, I and the children that Jehovah hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel", is quoted, in part, in @Hebrews 2:13. So that all that would enter into our own position, having a moral significance.
A.N.W. Would you say that every man, Jew or Gentile, in whom there is a work of God today would find his place in the assembly.
J.T. Quite so; and would take on these thoughts. He belongs to those who are signs and wonders in Israel; that is, among the people of God. It is most precious! And then, "And when they shall say unto you. Seek unto the necromancers and unto the soothsayers, who chirp and who mutter, say. Shall not a people seek unto their God?" chapter 8: 19. That is a fine word. Why should not people seek unto their God? And then, "To the law and the testimony! If they speak not according to this word, for them there is no daybreak", verse 20. Surely that has a very direct bearing at the present time; if we do not speak according to the word, we are without light.
A.B.P. Would the setting aside of Saul and the bringing in of David parallel this? Saul inquired of the witch of Endor, but David inquired of God.
J.T. Yes; Saul was seeking unto the necromancers. There is a good deal of seeking after the dead today. Terrible wickedness, in this sense, is current at the present time, but if people do not attend to the word of God and the testimony, there is no daybreak for them; it is continual darkness -- a terrible outlook. Then, in the next chapter we have the remnant waking to the great fact that a Child is born to them, "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name is called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace", chapter 9:6; that is, the Person of Christ becomes enlarged among them on moral lines.
{488}
We begin to see what a Person we have on our side.
J.T.Jr. Would the allusion, in chapter 6, to the glory filling the earth be alongside of this; that is, the extension of righteous government universally?
J.T. You can see how glorious Christ becomes in the eyes of the remnant. "Unto us", it reads. They come to see He is on their side as well as on God's side, and the same principle enters into the truth at the present time. It is one thing to see what Christ is on God's side, but what He is on ours is another thing.
A.R. Does the Child born imply what the remnant will go through in travail to bring Him forth, as it were?
J.T. We read later about Zion, "Before she travailed, she brought forth, before her pain came, she was delivered of a man-child ... . For as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her sons", @Isaiah 66:7,8. The Man-Child is the Lord Jesus, viewed not as the product of Israel's travail in this prophet; that view is given in @Revelation 12, where Christ is seen as the Male-Child, caught up to heaven immediately, and no doubt the assembly is caught up with Him. But here it is the Person known in Israel. The titles given suggest what He is to be to them; that is, the government is to be on His shoulder and His name is to be called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace. These are all relative terms in view of the millennial day. This is how they know Him.
C.N. Would you say how we come into the gain of these tides in the assembly?
J.T. The principle is that we come to see that He is on our side. @Hebrews 2:11,12 tells us that: "For both he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying, I will declare thy name to my brethren; in the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises". That is how we come into it. Hebrews is our book on that
{489}
line; it is written to Hebrew Christians -- not to Jews as such -- to lead them into the heavenly calling. The Jewish remnant in the future will come to know Christ according to these verses; that He is the Ruler; the government is to be on His shoulder. He is said to be "Wonderful". How important that is! The beast will fill the world with wonder after his kind. The whole world will wonder after him. This is over against that, Christ becomes known to the remnant as "Wonderful". That will be deliverance from the beast. And secondly, "Counsellor" -- He gives counsel. He tells us what to do; and thirdly. He is "Mighty God". Who can stand against Him? He is God, as marked by power. He is to be known in the millennium in that way. Then fourthly, the "Father of Eternity". That title of Christ is very little understood. It does not refer to what He was in past eternity. It is "Father" of the age; what He is going to be in the millennium. He will be such a Father! The whole world will be under His fatherly care; that is what is meant. And then "Prince of Peace", which will follow. All these titles refer to what Christ is or is to be characteristically in the millennial day.
J.T.Jr. Would you say, in regard to @Numbers 14:21, where the great rebellion took place against God, in relation to the land, and God made that remark about His glory, "But as surely as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of Jehovah!", that He had in view the understanding by His people, of these names of Himself?
J.T. Quite so; you can see how Christ fills the world with the glory of God. Luke stresses the thought of God being glorified through Christ. That is moral glory, but this will be resplendent manifested glory in this wonderful Person *born* to them as a Child and *given* to them as a Son. It is what He is amongst them; born to them and given to them. The name in this passage represents the renown of Christ. It is what He is as Man, although
{490}
Deity shines in it. These terms are relative -- manifested glory. The government is on His shoulder. Anyone can see what a glory that is. There is a Man supporting the government, whether it be the government of Israel or the government of the universe. What is His name? Well, we might say it is what He is in exploits -- what He does. You come in contact with Him and you find He is Wonderful. The gospels give the testimony to this on moral lines, but in the millennium the whole universe will see the wonders of Christ. Everything is done through Him. And then He is the Counsellor; anyone can go to Him and get wisdom ask Him things, as Moses sat all day to judge the people.
C.N. I am glad you made that remark as to moral lines. Is it your thought that He is all this to us now, on moral lines?
J.T. That is how He appears in the gospels.
C.N. It will be literally so in the millennium?
J.T. That is right, the whole earth will see that it is in Man. Solomon, of course, is the prototype of Christ in this light. When the Queen of Sheba came to him she was amazed. She said that the half had not been told. He exceeded, by far, what she had heard. A divine Person is before us. These things work out in Him personally, as over against the beast. The whole world will wonder after the beast, but now this is a wonderful Person exceeding all other persons; that is the idea. His name is *Wonderful* .
A.B.P. Does the name Wonderful relate in a particular way to His coming in as Deliverer as typified in Samson?
J.T. I suppose all the types help us here. The name Wonderful is seen in relation to the birth of Samson, @Judges 13:18. The first great idea in the word "name" is Shem, @Genesis 5:32. It is renown. Renown, in a divine sense, develops out of that son of Noah. Christ
{491}
is the embodiment of it all and His name is Wonderful. He has no peer.
A.N.W. Is the name of Emmanuel on another line?
J.T. That is "God with us". It enters into Matthew and gives character to that gospel. It comes in here, too -- in chapter 8 particularly. Here, it is how the remnant apprehends Him as on their side, so that in the statement, "This man was born there", @Psalm 87:6, He is accredited to Israel.
C.A.M. Will it be the features of Christ characteristically that will be seen in the future? Would it be right to use the word representatively as far as Christ's personality is concerned? The Lord Himself will be in heaven, will He not? One will be representative of Him.
J.T. He will be in heaven, but that does not mean that He always stays in heaven; He will come down. We are reading about the second coming of the Lord. These titles are in a Person known objectively. Some features may be reflected in the apostles. They were wonderful, too. Their signs were wonderful, but still, this is a description of a Person known objectively; the government is on His shoulder and His name is Wonderful. He is Counsellor, Mighty God, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace. You cannot carry these thoughts fully into the subjective line at all; although there may be some little suggestion of them in the Jewish remnant, and in the apostles, particularly as we see them in the Acts.
A.R.S. Would this name Wonderful be similar to what the apostle says in Philippians-"a name ... above every name"? @Philippians 2:9
J.T. Just so. I think it ought to be understood that this is a great objective presentation of Christ; it is, how He is to be known by the remnant presently. "Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name
{492}
is called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace".
C.A.M. Perhaps we could say, then, that while we look at this matter objectively in Christ, there will be also a wonderful reflection of that glorious Person in the remnant of Israel in the future.
J.T. There will be indeed.
C.H.H. The name includes Mighty God. That would exclude any creature.
J.T. Quite so.
J.H.E. In a coming day the Jews will be sought after: "Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: In those days shall ten men take hold, out of all languages of the nations, shall even take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying. We will go with you; for we have heard that God is with you", (@Zechariah 8:23).
J.T. Yes. It will be because God is with them. This Person will be known as among them.
A.P.T. Later on in this prophet we have, "And now, Jehovah, thou art our Father; we are the clay, and thou our potter", @Isaiah 64:8. Does that refer to the millennium?
J.T. Just so. We sometimes hear the expression that a man is the father of his country. That is the idea here -- "the Father of the age". Fatherly care will be manifested in Christ in the millennial day. In the gospels, too, you get the same thought. He calls the disciples "children" and a woman he calls "daughter".
F.N.W. Does chapter 22 confirm what you are saying about the title Father in @Isaiah 9:20 - 22? It says, "And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkijah; and I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand; and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah. And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder".
{493}
J.T. That is the same thought. Eliakim is a type of Christ. He will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the house of Judah. Another man is displaced by Him.
W.B-w. Do you think the saints will see Christ personally in His display. Some have said we will only see Him as displayed in the assembly.
J.T. @Revelation 1:7 says, "Behold, he comes with the clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they which have pierced him, and all the tribes of the land shall wail because of him". Then in @Zechariah 13:6 it says, "What are those wounds in thy hands?" It is hard to get over that. I think the objective side enters into these wonderful titles. They are millennial names. They will be reflected in the heavenly city, but still, scripture shows plainly that Christ personally will be seen by His earthly people-by "every eye", indeed.
A.B.P. Does Acts 1 confirm that? Verse 11 reads, "This Jesus ... shall thus come in the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven" @Acts 1:11.
J.T. It does. "In which ye have beheld him", @Acts 1:11 stresses the point.
A.P.T. What did the writer to the Hebrews mean when he said, "the habitable world which is to come, of which we speak", @Hebrews 2:5? Of what were they speaking?
J.T. The world to come is the millennial world. It is not the world in the sense of ornamentation or order, but the *habitable* world to come. Christ is set over that. It is the great central thought of prophecy, and we are dealing with it now; how He is to shine in it, governing it, and known to be on His people's side in all that; not only on God's side, but on man's side also.
W.R. In considering these verses, which of the two events have you in mind -- the first coming, in incarnation, or the second coming, in the millennium?
J.T. We are dealing with the second coming, which is
{494}
in mind in these two verses in chapter 9; it is what He will be in the millennial day. The Psalms corroborate all this, because they are experimental, David being the writer of the second Psalm had the mind of God about this, and he brings in the heavens in relation to the reign of Christ. The Psalm reads, "Why are the nations in tumultuous agitation, and why do the peoples meditate a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the princes plot together, against Jehovah and against his anointed: Let us break their bonds asunder, and cast away their cords from us! He that dwelleth in the heavens shall laugh, the Lord shall have them in derision. Then will he speak to them in his anger, and in his fierce displeasure will he terrify them: And *I* have anointed my king upon Zion, the hill of my holiness. I will declare the decree: Jehovah hath said unto me. Thou art my Son, *I* this day have begotten thee. Ask of me, and I will give thee nations for an inheritance, and for thy possession the ends of the earth: Thou shalt break them with a sceptre of iron, as a potter's vessel thou shalt dash them in pieces. And now, O kings, be ye wise, be admonished, ye judges of the earth. Serve Jehovah with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, though his anger burn but a little. Blessed are all who have their trust in him". This is David's Psalm; the first book is generally his. It is an experimental tribute to the whole position of Christ's glorious royalty as on the throne of Israel. @Acts 4 attributes Psalm 2 to David.
C.A.M. Nathanael seemed to realise the truth of this Psalm when he first saw the Lord. He said, "*Thou* art the Son of God, *thou* art the King of Israel", (@John 1:49).
J.T. Does that not confirm what we are saying as to the experimental side? It is a very beautiful touch, how faith comes in to corroborate all that is presented from
{495}
the divine side. The experimental side is seen in Nathanael, He is presented from that viewpoint. We are told what he said first under the fig-tree when Philip spoke to him, and then he comes to Jesus, who sees him coming and says, "Behold one truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile", (@John 1:47). And Nathanael says, "Thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel(@John 1:49)". Then the Lord completes the thought and extends the position to the whole race. He says, "Henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man", (@John 1:51). That is the third title; it appears in @Psalm 8. The Psalms would challenge us. Are we gathering up anything in following these things that are being said about the coming of the Lord, and all the glories that will attach to it. Are we *experiencing* anything in relation to all these things? That is the lesson in the Psalms.
C.H.H. Would you say that these early thoughts and experiences of Isaiah would colour all his writings?
J.T. Well, exactly; what a book we have received through him! What a beginning he had, but what a result for God! John says, "These things said Esaias because he saw his glory and spoke of him", @John 12:41. And in the Psalms, David is speaking about Him.
C.H.H. Isaiah says a little later, "Thine eyes shall see the King in his beauty", @Isaiah 33:17.
A.B.P. Does @Psalm 2 bridge the period of the assembly? Are the storm at Calvary and the coming of the Lord linked together?
J.T. I think so; it is in a Jewish setting. The assembly, must be, of course, regarded as hidden in the Old Testament.
J.T.Jr. In @Acts 4, where this Psalm is quoted in prayer, we are told that the place where the saints assembled shook, and in @Isaiah 6 the foundations of the
{496}
thresholds shook. The power of God supported the going forth of the word in a marked way at the beginning.
J.T. Quite so; the place where they were assembled was *shaken* . That is in advance of chapter 2, when there was a *rushing noise* ; but the building is shaken in chapter 4. The shaking is not in an unfriendly way, but a friendly one; it is suggestive of the power that is working in us.
A.R. When you speak about the experimental side, do you mean in regard to what we are gathering up? Do you mean we should be gathering up fresh impressions of Christ from these meetings?
J.T. That is surely what they are intended for; it is not merely that we are enjoying what we hear; we are to experience what these things mean. Great pressure has come over the world and we are in it, and God would cause all these things to support us in the pressure; and form us, and make us superior to it. So that the heavens laugh. The kings plan great things -- tumultuous agitation -- but the heavens are infinitely above that, and they are with what is right and against what is evil. "He that dwelleth in the heavens shall laugh, the Lord shall have them in derision", verse 4. And then we have the divine decree, *"I* this day have begotten thee". And then the appeal to all to kiss the Son. All this is introductory to the millennial day.
W.B-w. Does Isaiah's sight of the Lord on the throne in the glory correspond with this Psalm? He begins at the top, in describing the vision. It is remarkable that he begins with the Lord in glory on the throne.
J.T. When John was called into heaven he saw a throne *standing* in the heaven. @Revelation 4:2. It is the fixity of things up there.
W.B-w. Is it that we might be lifting our minds off the earth, and things that are going on among the peoples here?
{497}
J.T. Quite so. How much that is needed in our souls! We are so apt to be affected by the current tumultuous agitation.
A.R. While a ministry is being given, there must be faith operating on our part to apprehend and appropriate what is spoken.
J.T. I am sure of that, "By faith we apprehend (@Hebrews 11:3)". Without faith it is impossible to have any part in these things in the true sense.
A.P.T. As we move about we hear much talk in the world about current things. Do you think that as one has a living link with the Man for whom we are looking, His coming has more weight than all other events?
J.T. Quite so. That brings up the whole matter of the world to come, *of which we speak* . That is characteristically the theme of the saints. The Psalms present the experimental side of the truth, as if God were to say to us, I have said wonderful things in the law and the prophets, but there are people who have been listening to what I have been saying, and going through the thing experimentally. That enters into the Psalms as added to "the law of Moses and prophets" in @Luke 24:44. God would ask us, Are we learning? It is not only a matter of having had a good time here, but have we learned anything and put it into experience in our daily lives?
A.P.T. Would the suggestion of "child" and "son" and "Father" in @Isaiah 9 carry the thought of the experimental side?
J.T. That is right. You apprehend Him as a Child born. "Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name is called Wonderful ..."It is the increasing apprehension you have of Him; He gives you counsel; He is Mighty God and Father of Eternity. What progress you will make if you follow this line!
J.T.Jr. On the moral line, the result is peace in the
{498}
assembly; He is Prince of Peace within. It will be peace without when He comes.
J.T. One has thought very much of the epistle to the Philippians as a great epistle for us at the present time. @Isaiah 26:3 says, "Thou wilt keep in perfect peace the mind stayed on thee, for he confideth in thee". Philippians works that out. Think on certain things -- there are about eight different things mentioned -- "And the peace of God, which surpasses every understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts by Christ Jesus. For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are noble, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are amiable, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue and if any praise, think on these things. What ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, these things do; and the God of peace shall be with you", @Philippians 4:7 - 9. We need to be kept in peace in the midst of the storm.
C.H.H. @Psalm 46:1,2 speaks about tranquillity in spite of the nations raging. "God is our refuge and strength, a help in distresses, very readily found. Therefore will we not fear though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the heart of the seas".
{499}
SOUL PROGRESS IN PRESSURE
@Isaiah 37:l-17,21,23,30 - 32; @Isaiah 38:9,16 - 20
I wish to speak of progress of soul in pressure, referring to Hezekiah as an example of this. We are living in a time of great pressure, not only for the saints, but for the whole world; really more so for the world, for it does not have an outlet, as the saints do and as Hezekiah did, in prayer. When king Hezekiah heard the words of Rabshakeh "he rent his garments, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of Jehovah. And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz". This shows what pressure he was going through. If we go through pressure stoically, as the world generally does, we do not learn from it.
Sackcloth is not here an empty sign of humility and contrition. Hezekiah first rent his clothes and then covered himself with sackcloth. Rending the clothes would signify that there was something wrong. Our clothes suggest *what we are* , and we need to rend them as finding out something wrong in our circumstances. If pressure comes there is a cause. The moral side -- the searching -- is a vital matter, and then we convey the result to the prophet. We may thank God if we have a prophet in our midst! We speak to the Lord about the matter, but we have representatives of His down here; therefore Hezekiah could say to Isaiah, "lift up a prayer for the remnant that is left". The answer is immediate. It is a 'first-aid' answer; there will be relief at once, in measure. But then the king of Assyria sends another message. How Hezekiah reacts to this message! He went up into the house of Jehovah and spread the letter before Jehovah and prayed to
{500}
Him. There is no rending of clothes, or putting on of sackcloth now! There has been spiritual growth brought about by pressure. When we get on our knees the moral side will be settled. Now Hezekiah goes *up* ! This is moral elevation! It is like the ascent by which Solomon went up into the house of Jehovah. Such moral elevation is only for those who have clean hands and pure hearts.
Previously, Isaiah prayed, now Hezekiah prays. He has, in principle, reached sonship in his experience with God. He is free to speak to God. Look at the titles he uses: "Jehovah of hosts"; "God of Israel"; "the Same"; "God of all the kingdoms of the earth". Hezekiah is now at liberty with God! And the answer is in keeping with the prayer. He prayed as a son; the answer is, "the virgin-daughter of Zion (@Isaiah 37:22)". She despises the enemy and laughs him to scorn. "The daughter of Jerusalem shaketh her head at thee (@Isaiah 37:22)".
And then there is to be fruit to God out of the pressure. God gave Hezekiah a sign, that in the first year they were to eat such as groweth of itself. We might say it is like the fruit of the Spirit: "love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, fidelity, meekness, self-control (@Galatians 5:22,23)". The second year they were to eat "that which springeth of the same"; but in the third year they were to sow and reap; to plant and eat. Agricultural skill is required for that, and intelligence, too, for if we wish a certain crop we must sow accordingly. Pressure is intended to bring us to sonship, and sonship to fruitfulness.
Chapter 38 introduces the thought of something being added. Hezekiah is now going through *personal* pressure. Previously, it was a *national* pressure. He is now seen as sick unto death; he must go through this alone. He turned his face to the wall. But he prayed, and a sign was given him and fifteen years were *added* to his life. As a result we find that *he* adds his contribution to the service of God. It is originality
{501}
developed out of the pressure. The passage says: "The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness". And furthermore, "Lord, by these things men *live* , and in all these things is the *life* of my spirit, and thou hast recovered me, and made me to *live* . Behold, instead of peace I had bitterness upon bitterness; but thou hast in love delivered my soul from the pit of destruction; for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back ... . The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I this day; ... And we will play upon my stringed instruments all the days of our life, in the house of Jehovah". It is the living that shall praise Jehovah!
There is also the thought of playing upon *stringed* instruments. The harp is the highest order of stringed instrument. It is the instrument which is referred to as used in heaven. It is to be used now in the assembly. The pressure is intended to perfect praise to God. We do not add anything to God's service unless it is worthy or suitable to that service. Pressure is the means of refinement of the saints so that they may add to the service of God that which is original. Hezekiah says, "We will play upon my stringed instruments".
{502}
THE LORD'S COMING (11)
@Daniel 2;31 - 45; @Daniel 3:16 - 18; @Daniel 7:9 - 14; @Daniel 6:10; @Malachi 3:1 - 4
J.T. It has been suggested that we look at the post-captivity prophets in relation to the subject of the Lord's coming. Before proceeding to the scriptures bearing on our subject, it would be well to have Daniel before us in a *personal* sense, as we considered Isaiah at our last reading. Isaiah's history indicates how we come into the prophetic ministry. Daniel is exemplary, for in the presence of direct personal persecution he would have the service of God go on as before. The enemy's aim always is to interfere with what God is doing. To have a personal example is an advantage in the consideration of any scriptural subject or phase of a subject, and Daniel is this in what is before us now; that is, he would have the service of God go on as aforetime. The enemy undoubtedly, at the present time would cause a tremendous commotion in public affairs, affecting some of the saints directly, and affecting us all more or less, to the end that the service of God should be interrupted, or stopped entirely. So that Daniel is an example for us. It says of him, "And when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and, his windows being open in his upper chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled on his knees three times a day, and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime", @Daniel 6:10. This was his normal procedure. He did not open the windows for the occasion. And then, our passage in Malachi links on at this point as a result of the Lord coming in suddenly to His temple. The passage says, "he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and he will purify the children of Levi, and purge them as gold and
{503}
silver; and they shall offer unto Jehovah an oblation in righteousness. Then shall the oblation of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto Jehovah, as in the days of old, and as in former years", Malachi 3:3,4. It seemed to me that we should have these facts before us at the outset, so that we may continue at all costs with the service of God. That is the point for the moment, and the enemy would either interrupt it, interfering in various ways, or stop it.
L.E.S. Would Daniel's name have a bearing on this? I think it means 'God is judge'.
J.T. And the name of God that is used, signifies 'the Mighty One'. He is Judge of all the earth and has power to operate as He judges.
A.A.T. Can *one* man carry on the service of God?
J.T. We see an example here. The service is seen in Daniel's house and, of course, is limited. The question is whether, in our houses, we have our windows open towards Jerusalem so as to have daily, or more, services.
A.R. In @Daniel 6:5, it is said, "We shall not find any pretext against this Daniel, unless we find it against him touching the law of his God". What they had in mind was to stop him from serving God.
J.T. Quite so. So that this matter of carrying on the service as aforetime is most important. If we have had no household readings or prayer, this is the time to begin, but if we have had them, *keep on with them* ; do not let them be interfered with; even persecution should not be allowed to interfere with them.
W.B-w. In the book of Daniel, the enemy's first attack was in regard of food, in chapter 1. Then the second effort was to bring in false worship, in chapter 3. The third attack is to prevent true prayer, in chapter 6. Substitutes for the real thing are brought in - defiling food, a false image, and then prayer to Darius only; all were against the service of God in that sense.
J.T. You see how the man's house is ordered. "He
{504}
went into his house; and, his windows being open in his upper chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled on his knees three times a day, and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime" (@Daniel 6:10). The order of his house was always ready, his windows being open toward Jerusalem for this service, and he was ready to kneel even in what must have been extreme pressure, because he knew what the enemy was aiming at.
E.S. Was Joshua's language the same: "as for me and my house, we will serve Jehovah", @Joshua 24:15?
J.T. Yes. That was a resolution.
A.P.T. In the case of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego there seems to be an understanding of what worship means according to man; the cornet, pipe, the lute, and other instruments are all involved.
J.T. "Therefore at that time when all the peoples heard the sound of the cornet, pipe, lute, sambuca, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up", (@Daniel 3:7). According to the facts mentioned, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego did not do it. They said they would not do it; that is, they represent conscientious objectors. That is the true sense of conscientious objection. It is not sentiment; it is *conscience* . They stand for the true worship of God as knowing that the other was idolatry.
F.H.L. In @Acts 4, following the prayer, it is said the disciples were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God with boldness. That would be carrying on the service.
J.T. Conscience is seen in the fullest sense here, because it is a question of the worship of God. They have no hesitation in saying what they will do and what they cannot do. "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer thee in this matter", verse 16.
{505}
That is, in any other legitimate matter, they would acquiesce at once, but not in this matter. "If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thy hand, O king. But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image that thou hast set up", verses 17, 18. That is, I should say, a true testimony where conscience is involved -- that God must be served.
A.R.S. What about Daniel? He does not figure in this.
J.T. He would not have been there. God orders for His children in detail. He, apparently, is not called upon to go through this. Undoubtedly he would have done as the others had he been there.
A.N.W. God must be obeyed rather than man under such conditions. Peter says, "God must be obeyed rather than men", (@Acts 5:29).
J.T. The point now is that if we were tested, should we be like these three servants of God, answering unequivocally that we cannot do a particular thing on the ground of conscience -- a *good* conscience -- "the demand as before God of a good conscience", (@1 Peter 3:21).
C.N. This objection is in relation to idolatrous worship. Now, the conditions that we may be called to face may be of a different character. Would you just say something about that?
J.T. It is only the principle of which we are speaking; whatever it be that you cannot do as an enlightened believer, having a good conscience before God, your answer is definite. That was all I was thinking of as entering into the present time. It is remarkable that at the beginning of those monarchies, the question of conscience should appear so distinctly; and that Nebuchadnezzar, the first king, the head of gold in the great image, should be converted. He was not converted by
{506}
the first interpretation of Daniel. He was converted later, and this image that he set up, apparently would be the outcome of the other great image that he saw. Instead of being affected by Daniel's interpretation of it, he seeks to insist on this image as an object of worship.
W.R. Would you say that Daniel's conscious knowledge of God evidenced itself in his movements? He says, "Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever; for wisdom and might are his", @Daniel 2:20. Further, he says, "I thank thee, and I praise thee, O God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might", @Daniel 2:23.
J.T. You might say he is a young brother that has grown in the knowledge of God. The refusal of the king's meat and the choice of pulse showed his godliness and purpose. He is an excellent example for every one of us.
W.B-w. The first image had a governmental character; the second a religious character.
J.T. The first image represents what God has set up; it was seen in a dream from God; it was light for the king. Daniel says to him in the interpretation, "Forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold - the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter. And the dream is certain, and the interpretation of it sure", verse 45. But the light did not save Nebuchadnezzar from setting up an idolatrous image.
C.A.M. I suppose Nebuchadnezzar's repentance, as seen in the end of chapter 4, would demolish, in his mind, the second image. He would never again set up that image after his conversion.
J.T. He would not; in fact chapter 3 would demolish the second image. It says in verse 28, "Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said. Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and
{507}
delivered his servants who trusted in him, and who changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God! Therefore I make a decree, that in every people, nation, and language, he who shall speak anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and his house shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that is able to deliver after this sort", @Daniel 3:28,29. He, so to say, demolishes the thing at once, but the next chapter is where his definite conversion comes in.
W.B-w. The faithfulness of the saints demolishes the second image, whereas the stone without hands will demolish the first one.
J.T. Yes, the stone without hands will demolish the first as having degenerated to the iron and clay.
W.B-w. That will take place with the beast, according to @Revelation 19.
J.T. Quite so; the whole image is included in that, but judgment is executed on the worst feature of it.
L.E.S. Would you say a word about these four young men being in the employ of the government?
J.T. Well, I think they show that, as Christians, we can well afford to serve the government in legitimate matters. We should be very glad to do it in the hour of their need. It is surely right that we should regard government in a sympathetic way.
F.S.C. What is there in Nebuchadnezzar that corresponds to the head of gold?
J.T. Well, I think that he represents the head of gold, taking his whole history as he stands, including his conversion; not, of course, as casting these men into the fiery furnace. That would not be the gold; that would be the very opposite. But he became converted, and we are told that a man's heart was given to him. Evidently he came to have the right feelings of a man. So that Daniel says, "thou art this head of gold",
{508}
chapter 2:38. It does not seem as if the immediate successors of Nebuchadnezzar came into it; giving emphasis that it was only Nebuchadnezzar, because of what he became -- a converted man -- that personally, he represented God. God gave the four monarchies a wonderful start in that way. He says, "And after thee shall arise another kingdom", verse 39. It is after *thee* ; not simply after Babylon.
A.B.P. Does the image represent deterioration in the *form* of government as well as in its administration?
J.T. Yes. The whole thing has deteriorated, and that is why the judgment is of God. The stone cut out without hands breaks in pieces the whole image. Although Babylon had existed for a long time before, it was in Nebuchadnezzar that it took its place as the first of the four monarchies which fill out "the times of the nations (@Luke 21:24)". Including Babylon, the whole image went on to degeneration and the terrible conditions that arose in it, according to the book of Revelation.
C.A.M. One reason why it would be necessary for these Hebrew men to give the government everything possible in their service, is that as long as they were there they were really a voice to the king; and do you not think that was so even in the time of Darius?
J.T. Quite so, both Daniel and the other three would be in testimony to God; their position was quite legitimate in serving the government.
A.N.W. It has been said that the government has a right in an extremity to go so far as to claim my body, but it cannot claim my conscience and soul. Is that right? The blessed Lord remained a prisoner in the Roman power.
J.T. I would not say that, because my body is the Lord's, I should not like to hand my body over to them unconditionally. As to the Lord Jesus, they came and arrested Him. Of course. He delivered Himself up, but it was on the principle of the government seizing Him.
{509}
They seized Him. He did not go to give Himself up to the authorities until they came to take Him with swords and sticks.
J.T.Jr. Is the same idea seen in connection with the bodies of the three who refused to worship the image? It says, "delivered his servants who trusted in him, and who changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God!" @Daniel 3:28
J.T. They yielded their bodies to *God* in that. It was a sacrifice. They yielded them on the altar of God for the truth. They were martyrs, in effect.
C.N. Would Daniel's continuing until Cyrus indicate that such characteristic persons as Daniel will continue until the Lord comes?
J.T. Well, it would seem as if he is honoured in that he lived so long, till the reign of Cyrus -- the man that ordered the building of the house of God. It seems as if God would have him there. He then would be a very old man. "Go thy way, Daniel; ... and thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days", (@Daniel 12:9,13). He was a man highly pleasing to heaven, and undoubtedly God had that in mind in leaving him so long down here.
A.Pf. I would like to ask you about Cornelius the centurion and the pious soldier under him. What was their duty in being soldiers? Would they go out to battle?
J.T. No doubt they would. Cornelius was an officer in the Roman army, and he had a soldier for his servant.
A.Pf. Would the conscience not come into play with them?
J.T. As coming into the truth, they had already addicted themselves to military service. The Spirit of God mentions it, and we have to accept it. Of course, there are brethren today who entered the army and
{510}
navy before they were brought into the truth. Military work in this sense is not on the same level of evil as idolatrous worship required of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego.
W.F.K. They were converted in it.
A.B.P. Would you say that the conscience clause, in that sense, is not only a means by which the Christian can maintain a clear conscience, but also offers opportunity for public testimony today?
J.T. It gives opportunity to bear testimony to the truth of the Spirit of Christ. It is an extraordinary situation, because an army is as necessary to a government today as it was in Nebuchadnezzar's time - a police force and such like are essential for government. But the Lord Jesus has come in in the meantime, and He has introduced another spirit into the world. His followers are outside of all this, and they are a peculiar people, a heavenly people, and have to suffer, but it certainly is incumbent upon them to make clear that they are not against government, that government is of God, and they are willing to serve the government as far as they can, in keeping with the teaching of the Lord Jesus. But when the Lord comes back Himself, He will use the sword; He will come out of heaven with the armies of heaven after Him. Our position now is therefore unique. There never has been a position in the testimony like the Christian's position; Christians are now in it, and hence we have to suffer.
A.R. These three men were promoted in the kingdom. They would help in the kingdom of Babylon afterwards.
A.P.T. A lawless nation is no different in the eyes of God than a lawless man.
J.T. Not at all. Lawlessness is as objectionable to God in a nation as in a man. Well, we want now to get on more definitely to our subject; that is, the coming of the Lord. What we have been saying is really causing the truth to bear on our own consciences at the moment,
{511}
but this image that Daniel saw, sets out the truth of the Lord's coming in a certain peculiar way, and we want to see that. His kingdom comes in in the figure of *a stone* . "And the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth", chapter 2:35. Now that stone is Christ -- Christ's kingdom - and it is alluded to again in verse 45: "Forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold, -- the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass here -- after". That is the stone, or the kingdom, "which shall never be destroyed; and the sovereignty thereof shall not be left to another people: it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, but itself shall stand for ever", verse 44. That phase of the coming of the Lord is presented in this section of scripture.
W.F.K. Is this the kingdom of God, as we know it; and will it last for ever?
J.T. Well, it is the kingdom of God; we have it now in a moral way, but this is literally a kingdom set up in this world, and it breaks in pieces all that preceded it. It is seen in the book of Revelation: "The kingdom of the world of our Lord and of his Christ", @Revelation 11:15. Here, however, it is seen in its power as dealing with other kingdoms, which God had owned for a time, but now He is judging them and breaking them up; so that all these kingdoms that we are having to do with today and are subject to, will be broken up by this kingdom, which is pictured here as a stone.
A.A.T. There will be no Christians in that kingdom, will there?
J.T. It has the millennial day in mind; the kingdom of the Lord and His Christ, but it is to be divinely powerful, breaking up the four empires spoken of in Daniel, and it will never be superseded.
F.S.C. What is the force of the stone breaking the
{512}
iron as over against the iron itself breaking and subduing, as seen in verse 40?
J.T. Stone usually represents permanency, I think, and "cut out without hands", alludes to the deity of Christ. It is to be a heavenly kingdom and He will establish and inaugurate it. It is permanency.
A.R. When the Lord said to Peter, "thou art Peter" -- a stone -- did He have in mind the same idea, that he was going through to another kingdom?
J.T. He was material of a permanent quality. You see what is said about the breaking in pieces: "whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron doth not mingle with clay. And in the days of these kings shall the God of the heavens set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed; and the sovereignty thereof shall not be left to another people: it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, but itself shall stand for ever", verses 43,44. The stone, as a figure, is then alluded to, "forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold -- the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter", verse 45. That is, the stone is the type, spiritually of the final kingdom, but it is simply a kingdom -- "the kingdom of the world of our Lord and of his Christ" (@Revelation 11:15) -- only that it is all-powerful.
N.P. Is that the thought in @1 Thessalonians 5:2, "the day of the Lord so comes as a thief by night"?
J.T. Yes; only what we are speaking of follows that; we have considered it before, that it comes suddenly and unexpectedly. But this passage is dealing with the great image, the head of which was of gold, the finest thought, representing what is of God, and set up according to God. You can see what is of God in a man
{513}
like Nebuchadnezzar, who was converted, but there is constant deterioration. "After thee", in verse 39, refers to the next kingdom -- not the next king -- so that the kingdom of the Medes is said to be "inferior to thee". And so it goes on to say, "then another third kingdom of brass", which is inferior to the second; and another -- the fourth -- "part of potter's clay, and part of iron ... partly strong and partly fragile". That is the most degraded feature, and that having run its course, the kingdom of the heavens comes in and breaks to pieces all these kingdoms; the whole image is broken and looked at as one thing because of this degeneration. There is a moral reason for it because it was never intended to be anything else but *provisional* , for the sake of the testimony till the coming of the Lord.
A.R.S. Everything that is set up here finally degenerates if man has anything to do with it whereas Christ's kingdom does not degenerate.
J.T. The millennium, in a general sense, does, alas! But abstractly, the kingdom does not. The millennium is seen as ending in a perfect way, but @Numbers 29 indicates decline throughout. The passage refers to thirteen bullocks, twelve bullocks, eleven bullocks, ten bullocks, nine bullocks, eight bullocks, and seven bullocks, but it does not go below seven bullocks. That is, the thing is perfect spiritually, but there is diminution in the appreciation of it. At the end of the thousand years Satan, as loosed from his prison, shall deceive the nations, and they shall surround the camp of the saints and the beloved city. This is a solemn consideration as a further testimony to the incorrigibleness of man in the flesh.
A.R.S. The Lord Jesus delivers up the kingdom at the end.
J.T. That shows it is intact. "Then the end, when he gives up the kingdom to him who is God and Father; when he shall have annulled all rule and all authority
{514}
and power. For he must reign until he put all enemies under his feet", (@1 Corinthians 15:24,25).
F.H.L. Is that the kingdom in mind in @John 18:36 "My kingdom is not of this world"?
J.T. Yes. The Lord speaks there of its origin and character.
A.N.W. Do you think "without hands" suggests Deity?
J.T. I do.
A.N.W. However strong the iron might be, it is made with hands.
Ques. Is this the kingdom that God had in mind from the outset?
J.T. Quite so; the Lord Jesus is in view as King. He told Pilate that He had been born for this, and His kingdom stands. "If my kingdom were of this world, my servants had fought", (@John 18:36). It is a heavenly kingdom that comes in, symbolised by stone because, I think, it is divine, and intended to be permanent; it is never to be superseded. The idea of "rock" or "stone" is much attached, in scripture, to divine Persons.
L.E.S. The features of the head of gold would be seen in Nebuchadnezzar, in @Daniel 4:3, where he refers to God's kingdom as an everlasting kingdom. The testimony to what we are saying is rendered there.
J.T. Quite so; that is what we want to come into now. It has already come in; Christ in heaven and the Holy Spirit here implies the kingdom; it is in a provisional state in view of the present character of the testimony, but it goes through; there is no end to it. It will take another form presently, when He comes out of heaven; it will take a form suited to "the kingdom of the world of our Lord and of his Christ (@Revelation 11:15)". But it is the same thing going right through. So that we want to get into that. Even Christians are set up as a kingdom, @Revelation 1:6.
L.E.S. So Nebuchadnezzar goes on to say, "How
{515}
great are his signs! ... His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation", (@Daniel 4:3).
A.R. Is that the meaning of the word, "a kingdom not to be shaken", (@Hebrews 12:28)? It cannot be shaken.
J.T. And we have *received* it.
R.W.S. So that even as coming in a moral sense, without observation, it is universal, is it not? And it will have no frontier in a coming day, in a public sense. It will do away with all other kingdoms.
J.T. Yes. The Lord says it "does not come with observation", (@Luke 17:20). It has already come in this way, and it is here now. It is here by the Spirit -- Christ in heaven, and the Holy Spirit here. The Lord said, "the kingdom of God is in the midst of you (@Luke 17:21)". It was there in Himself. Now it is in the Holy Spirit as here in the assembly. Presently it will be here in full public display, "as the lightning goes forth from the east and shines to the west, so shall be the coming of the Son of man", (@Matthew 24:27). He comes out in public display and power, and that is what is alluded to here in the kingdom that breaks all in pieces. But the divinity, permanency and greatness of Him that is Head of it is seen in the stone that is cut out without hands, filling the whole earth. It is a wonderful thought, and the Lord would bring us into it now.
W.B-w. Would you not put the gold before the stone?
J.T. Well, what Nebuchadnezzar represented was the principle *of government* according to God, but being in a creature, it degenerates. The stone is by itself; as representing Christ, it does not degenerate but remains for ever. Now, chapter 7 gives us another view of His kingdom. It is said, "I beheld till thrones were set", (the footnote reads, "'cast', placed as cushions, for sitting upon") "and the Ancient of days did sit: his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like
{516}
pure wool; his throne was flames of fire, and its wheels burning fire. A stream of fire issued and came forth from before him; thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened", Daniel 7:9,10. And then later, it says, "I saw in the night visions, and behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like a son of man, and he came up even to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed", verses 13,14. I think we ought to take these two passages in particularly. The first is the magnificence of Christ's kingdom, the number of persons ministering to Him. It is what He is - a divine Person. In the second passage He is seen as Son of man coming from our side, as belonging to the race, and approaching the Ancient of days. He is Himself seen as the Ancient of days in verse 9; but in verse 13 He comes "even to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him". It is the acceptableness of Christ before God, corresponding somewhat to what He is in chapter 5 of Revelation. He is the Lion of the tribe of Judah who opens the seals.
C.A.M. Is the purpose in His being presented in two different Personages to bring out the greatness of the Person of Christ?
J.T. The first is what He is on God's side, corresponding with the stone cut out without hands. It is what He is Himself divinely, in verses 9 and 10. And then in verses 13 and 14, it is what He is on our side; the Son of man, and He is brought near to the Ancient of days.
C.A.M. That helps, because it would look as if it is God considering for the fact that we are not capacitated
{517}
to think of two different presentations at the same time, and yet we do hold both those glorious views of Christ.
J.T. We do, indeed, so that He presents Himself as the "root and offspring of David (@Revelation 22:16)". What He is divinely -- from the divine side -- the Root of David, would correspond with verse 9; but as the Offspring, He is on man's side.
A.N.W. The description of the Ancient of days and the title "Son of man" are linked together in Revelation. He is said to be "one like the Son of man ... his head and hair white like white wool", @Revelation 1:13,14.
A.R. In your remarks as to verse 9, you mean the truth goes back; whereas, in verse 13, it goes forward?
J.T. Yes; the former is Deity, bringing in what Christ is in the kingdom. We bow down to Him; He is King; He is a divine Person. But then He is on our side, too. He comes before the Ancient of days. His life here upon earth was delightful to God, and He was made Lord and Christ. God made Him that.
E.E.H. Verse 13 is mediatorial.
L.E.S. Would that help us in filling out our position here in relation to the thought of government and the ways of God?
J.T. I think so. The Lord says, "that ye may ... sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel", (@Luke 22;30); and the twenty-four elders are on thrones, too. To the overcomer in Laodicea He says, "to him will I give to sit with me in my throne", (@Revelation 3:21).
W.B-w. Chapter 7 opens up with four beasts, suggesting the four monarchies, I suppose, and then is the point to show that He supersedes all these?
J.T. That is the point. Chapter 2 is an image - one idea -- an image like a man. In appearance it is a monstrosity, you might say, but these are four separate kingdoms, and to one "like a son of man" is given "dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, ... his dominion
{518}
is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed".
M.O. Does the remnant in @Luke 1 see this kingdom filling the whole earth. Mary says, "He has put down rulers from thrones, and exalted the lowly", @Luke 1:52. And Simeon says, "a light for revelation of the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel", (@Luke 2:32).
J.T. Just so; it works out there. So the angel's announcement is "for today a Saviour has been born to you in David's city, who is Christ the Lord", (@Luke 2:11). That is the One who rules; but it is *unto us* . He is on our side.
A.N.W. @Daniel 7:18 says, "the saints of the most high places shall receive the kingdom, and they shall possess the kingdom for ever, even to the ages of ages". I was wondering, is that our family, or is it another family?
J.T. That is another side of the position. The saints come into it, so it is viewed as our kingdom. And then you see the saints judging five or ten cities. How many cities there will be, who can tell? But the saints will have authority over them. So that, publicly, that is just how the truth stands, that the saints have a kingdom. We are suffering now, but if we suffer, we shall reign publicly. No doubt those who form the assembly will have part in all this. According to Ephesians they are "saints of the most high places (@Daniel 7:18)".
F.H.L. Daniel was waiting until God's throne was set up and until the beast was slain. It was *a faith* time.
J.T. Quite so; these things are most exhilarating, if we can only get into the spirit of them. He has "made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father", (@Revelation 1:6). So that publicly we are carrying on, but the first presentations here are to bring out the greatness and glory of Christ in His coming in the future, in His kingdom.
{519}
J.T.Jr. Would the "clouds of heaven" always be the evidence of His coming? We have the same expression in Revelation.
J.T. I think such allusions call attention to Deity. What is suitable to a king in his public appearing, is well known in the ways of man. I think the clouds are a sort of symbol to denote what properly belongs to divine Persons in their public appearings.
C.N. According to verse 15 this vision would seem to have a great effect on Daniel. Would you say a word as to that?
J.T. Yes, he says, "As for me Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me. I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the certainty of all this. And he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things: These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, that shall arise out of the earth. But the saints of the most high places shall receive the kingdom, and they shall possess the kingdom for ever, even to the ages of ages", @Daniel 7:15 - 18. The interpretation given would have quieted Daniel. That the saints should possess the kingdom for ever would no doubt cause him joy. Whatever may happen in the history of the beasts, the saints will have the kingdom. This is very assuring. Verse 28 shows, however, that Daniel continued to be troubled.
Ques. Would you say that the demolition of these four kingdoms starts now in men like Daniel?
J.T. Yes; although set up of God for a purpose, their degenerated principles must be overthrown in all our hearts. The Christian begins to disallow what is evil, and allow the Lord Jesus to rule there. That is the point. We are thus in the kingdom of God in a practical way.
A.R. The Lord says to Daniel, "And thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days", @Daniel 12:13. Would that confirm what you are saying?
J.T. It would. The whole book has Daniel in mind
{520}
personally; he is exemplary. You would seek to be like Daniel. Thus heaven has confidence in you; that is the idea. The gospel of Matthew is on that principle. "And behold, *I* am with you all the days", @Matthew 28:20. This implied that the Lord had confidence in the disciples.
C.A.M. Would you say that Daniel, personally, is seen in the first half of the book, differently to the second half; in the first the testimony can be understood on the outside; in the second half it is more the private view?
J.T. Yes. I think he is presented in the early chapters -- chapter 1 particularly -- as a model for us, just as we were speaking of Isaiah. We come into the prophetic spirit and testimony by the way indicated by Isaiah -- self judgment. Here it is the personality of Daniel, how he refuses the king's meat, and evidencing his godliness (God being with him, giving him distinction) he is brought before the king; he stands before great men. That is what the book of Proverbs indicates.
L.E.S. Would the position of Daniel here be analogous to the position of the Lord in Matthew in the presence of the ways of God governmentally? Daniel is referred to as a man "greatly beloved".
J.T. Yes. His personality is seen right through the book, and in other books, too. Think of the distinction that man had in the testimony of God! A young man may thus acquire power and distinction to stand before great personages; God promotes him as one pleasing to Him.
W.F.K. Heaven is interested in him and sends Gabriel to him.
J.T. And he is addressed as greatly beloved! The angel is there to make Daniel skilful of understanding. I think that is a point for us now. And then the thought of the personality of Daniel, added to the great facts before us relative to the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ in His kingdom.
{521}
C.A.M. The key to that would be that, in his soul, he was very near to the altar.
J.T. Quite so; he was at the centre of everything in prayer. If we are with God, we get inklings from Him about current things. You could not speak in a prophetic way, perhaps, but you get impressions from God of what is happening; all, of course, in view of the Lord's coming.
A.P.T. Who are those millions of verse 10?
J.T. The thought is in the *number* ; they stood before Him.
A.P.T. The verse says, "thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened", @Daniel 7:10.
J.T. The time of reckoning had come, confirmed in verses 11 and 12. Verse 27 is very assuring as showing that the kingdom is Christ's, it is given to the people of the saints of the most high places. The place they have in this vision is remarkable and comforting. @Revelation 20 teaches that those who have part in the first resurrection reign with Christ a thousand years.
C.A.M. We get an impression from Mr. Darby's hymns of the vastness of the number of the redeemed and the immensity of the range of Christ's kingdom.
J.T. We do -- from hymn 14 particularly.
J.T.Jr. Verse 22 says "The appointed time arrived". The thing is set to arrive at a given time.
J.T. Yes. "I beheld, and that horn made war with the saints, and prevailed over them", @Daniel 7:21. Presently he will make war with the Lamb, too, but here it is the saints; "and judgment was given to the saints of the most high places; and the appointed time arrived, and the saints possessed the kingdom", @Daniel 7:22. There is no question about it. All will be finalised in this way. And then you see again, "But the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole
{522}
heavens, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most high places. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him. So far is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my countenance was changed in me; but I kept the matter in my heart", @Daniel 7:27,28. As having the Holy Spirit we ought to take these things in and be restful in them.
R.W.S. Verse 20 says, "... whose look was more imposing than its fellows @Daniel 7:20". There is a divine answer to it. Would not all this help us today -- the imposingness of this kingdom on the one hand, but over against that the inward power to overcome it?
J.T. Quite so.
A.N.W. Would you say how you view the "age of ages" in connection with the kingdom?
J.T. The Spirit of God uses the word "everlasting", verse 27 -- eternal conditions; the same as in @Ephesians 3:21, glory to God "in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages".
A.N.W. Do you carry the kingdom thought right through?
J.T. Christ delivers it up to His Father. But the principle of the kingdom will remain. "Then the end, when he gives up the kingdom to him who is God and Father", (@1 Corinthians 15:24). It is further said, "the Son also himself shall be placed in subjection to him who put all things in subjection to him, that God may be all in all", (@1 Corinthians 15:28).
W.B-w. Would you tell us why these two angels are mentioned in the following two chapters? Gabriel comes in giving skilful understanding, and Michael comes in in connection with strength.
J.T. I think the first -- Gabriel -- is the *priestly* angel, having to do with prayer. He makes a great deal of Daniel's prayer. He is seen in Luke in the same way, going in to Zacharias. Michael is seen more in relation
{523}
to the *military* side. He is called an archangel, and "Michael your prince", @Daniel 10:21. He wars with the dragon and casts him and his angels out of heaven, @Revelation 12:7.
W.F.K. Had you something in mind as to the Lord's coming, in Malachi?
J.T. Well, it was just the thought of finishing our subject in the post-captivity prophets. "Behold, I send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me; and the Lord whom ye seek will suddenly come to his temple, and the Angel of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he cometh, saith Jehovah of hosts", chapter 3:1. This would be preliminary, really, to what we have already spoken of, only it brings out the testing time for the saints. "Who shall stand when he appeareth? For he will be like a refiner's fire, and like fullers¬ lye. And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and he will purify the children of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver; and they shall offer unto Jehovah an oblation in righteousness. Then shall the oblation of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto Jehovah, as in the days of old, and as in former years", verses 3,4. It was just to bring out the thought that He comes in "suddenly", but He comes into His *temple* . It is in view of the *service of God* . It is not military, but that the service should go on as it used to "in the days of old, and as in former years".
C.A.M. Is that the reason the Lord is stressing the matter of the temple and its holiness?
J.T. I thought so. It seems to fit in with the present exercises of the saints -- how the service of God involves the temple.
A.R. Why is so much said of the temple in Revelation? Is that the same idea?
J.T. It is; the temple of God and the worshippers are measured. It is of utmost importance that through all the present turmoil, the service of God should continue.
{524}
R.W.S. Is this temple a physical thing?
J.T. It will be. It alludes to the coming position at Jerusalem. The Lord had appeared suddenly there, and He will again, but the result is that the service is to continue.
W.B-w. Daniel opened his windows toward Jerusalem, but here you get the temple.
J.T. Quite so; Malachi has the temple in mind. He makes a great deal of the sons of Levi, the priests.
A.R. Like Zacharias at the beginning of Luke's gospel?
J.T. Malachi links on with Luke; the New Testament links on with the Old in the priesthood, showing that the service of God must go on. So the Lord comes into the *temple* . Simeon takes Him up in his arms. Simeon came in as a priest. He came in *by the Spirit --* it is a spiritual priesthood -- and he blesses God. He takes the Babe in his arms, and Anna, one who served God day and night in the *temple* , rejoices at the same time.
W.B-w. "There was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon", (@Luke 2:25). He was in Jerusalem.
J.T. He was a provision, ready to receive the Lord in a truly priestly way. That is what is meant; so the service of God is to go on in these lines; thus the gospel closes with the disciples in Jerusalem full of joy, continually *in the temple* praising God. The service goes on. That is the thing to keep in our souls, I am sure.
"The ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them ... to search out a resting place for them", (@Numbers 10:33). "They drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ", (@1 Corinthians 10:4).
The Rock went behind and the ark went before. All the pioneering work involving the severest conflict and drudgery, so to speak, belonged to the Lord. The
{525}
allusion, I suppose, to the Rock which followed them gives the thought of water-carrying -- a sort of drudgery, divine love expressing itself thus.
In @Numbers 10, we find that the proper position of the ark was in the centre, the divine intent being that Christ should be honoured among the people, and that all should serve Him. Instead of that, however. He breaks through the ordinary rule and goes before. It is a very remarkable thing that there is nothing said previously about the ark going before, showing how divine love reserves its own liberty. It acts from itself, as the Lord did when He sat at table; then rising from supper He laid aside His garments. The divine way is to give up for the good of others and to accept the drudgery.
{526}
DIVINE TESTING
@Deuteronomy 8:2,3; @1 Peter 1:6,7; @Genesis 22:1 - 4
My subject, dear brethren, is divine testing; a feature of the present time, not only as regards the people of God but the nations particularly, and the whole sphere of Christian profession. All are tested in a peculiar way at the present time. The Lord's people feel it most keenly, believers in Christ -- those who take on of His spirit -- are more sensitive than others as to what God ordains in the way of trial. The Lord had warned His disciples that they should hear of wars and rumours of wars, saying, "For nation shall rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be earthquakes in different places", and adding, "these things are the beginnings of throes", (@Mark 13:8). But, He says, You are not to be disturbed. He forearmed His people in view of crises that would greatly oppress others, that they should not be terrified. The prophetic word is a great advantage to us in this respect. We have insight into current matters that others have not, and thus are armed against being unnecessarily disturbed. The Lord, too, having forewarned us in the prophetic page Himself, is ready to assist us as to any acuteness of feeling. Much arises from fear, natural feeling and pessimism. Much unnecessary suffering is experienced; and the Lord is ready to assist us as to anything crucial in that way, to relieve our minds, for He would not have us to be burdened by what does not exist, and never will exist. He is a great Priest above; His priesthood implies His sympathy with us, that He can be touched with the feelings of our infirmities. But not with the feelings arising from our natural proclivities -- our feelings -- national or otherwise. These are in themselves to be
{527}
judged as sinful, not being of faith, and yet they may appear right. We often suffer from physical fear, which the Lord enjoins against: "And be not afraid of those who kill the body, but cannot kill the soul; but fear rather him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell", (@Matthew 10:28). Attention to that word would save us from much. The fear of man works a snare, but the fear of God is imperative and protective. I do not refer to slavish fear, but reverential fear. He is by our side in that.
In making these remarks I come to the passage in Deuteronomy which tells us of divine leading in the wilderness. Jehovah said to the people, "And thou shalt remember all the way which Jehovah thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness", chapter 8:2. Actual facts recorded would hardly lead us to conclude that God was leading *all* the time, for man's will led a great deal in what happened. We have rebellion upon rebellion, which of course is the outcome of man's will; but yet all these rebellions did not shut out God from leading His people. Even at the height of Korah's rebellion God was not shut out; He was present all the time; He stood by Moses and Aaron and all those who stood by the truth with them. He here accredits Himself with having led them in the wilderness for forty years. The apostle Paul tells us, referring to this same thing, that Jehovah "nursed them in the desert" for about forty years. (@Acts 13:18), a most touching fact. He bore with their manners as a parent has to bear with the adverse manners of his children. It may be necessary to bear with them to a point, but only to a point, for ill manners in a household, allowed indefinitely by parents, are contrary to God's will. God bore with the manners of His people in the wilderness for forty years, but then we know He used the rod, and severely too. In fact, six hundred thousand men, from twenty years old and above, died in the wilderness
{528}
on account of their manners; their carcases were strewn in the desert. So that parents are reminded that ill manners are not to be indefinitely allowed. They are to be refused in principle. God bore with the manners of Israel, but the history shows He used the severest measures against the evil manifest in them.
Our chapter says, "And thou shalt remember all the way which Jehovah thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thy heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments or not". It is not that God did not know what was in their hearts; I need not say that. The point is to bring out the knowledge of it; to bring out information; for all proceedings, judicial or otherwise, must be based on accredited testimony. God does not judge people exactly for what is in their hearts; it is what is brought out of their hearts -- what is known -- that He deals with. We sometimes wonder, doubtless, why God allows so much evil; but in a certain sense He orders it: "... making peace and creating evil", He says in @Isaiah 45:7. It is a feature of His ways to bring out evil, even to furnish means of provoking it, so that sin might become exceeding sinful. We often challenge this in our minds, doubtless, and upbraid God in it, but while He speaks of that in Isaiah, He warns against answering again to Him. It is a common thing today to hear men say. If there be a God, why does He allow such dreadful things as are happening? It is challenging God. Who dare do it? It is His own realm. Who dare question His right to provoke sin so that sin might appear as it really is? What it really is, can be fully seen in Satan; but the trial is not in Satan now; it is in men, and God will bring out what is there. He says, "Let him that does unrighteously do unrighteously still", (@Revelation 22:11). In His governmental ways, God allows evil, long practised, to work out in certain persons; one of the most solemn things in scripture. If
{529}
one is filthy, let him be that; the word says. It is judicial. Judas is an example. God allowed sin in a peculiar form in that man; and it must be so. It was allowed "that the scripture might be fulfilled", (@John 13:18). It is well to take these things into account, dear brethren, because they allay our fears as to much that is current, and challenge us too, if we dare to answer again to God. "Who art *thou*" He enquires, "that answerest again to God?" (@Romans 9:20).
Well, as has been said, our chapter records that God led them in the wilderness to know what was in their hearts. Who could tell what was in their hearts when they started out across the Red Sea? God, of course, knew; but who else could tell? You see young persons in that throng which went out from Egypt; amiable, obedient to their parents, having seen what had happened, how the firstborn of Egypt were slain and Israel spared. Who can say what will mature in these young men as they advance under divine leadership in contrary circumstances? How many of us can witness to what we have seen in our day! How little we expected to see what we have seen in youth as it developed! But it was there and it has been brought out "to know what was *in* thy heart". It is not exactly that God wished to know, but it is brought out in testimony.
God is leading His people now in these parts. We have great encouragement in divine leading, but then what about our hearts? Young men and women are growing up and coming into fellowship; commendable as far as the brethren see, but God says, I am leading, and what is in their hearts will come out; it will become a matter of public note; and it is only as it becomes such that it can be dealt with according to God. We do not deal with it while it is in their hearts; we do not know all that is there, but God does. He says, I will bring it out, as it says in our verse, "... to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thy heart,
{530}
whether thou wouldest keep his commandments or not". That is an open question. A boy or a girl of thirteen, fourteen, or fifteen years of age desires to break bread, and the parents like it very much; we all like it. But then what is in their hearts? God is concerned about that, and what will develop out of it; and yet He says, as leading, I will take them on. I suppose two million people were led by God in the wilderness. Day in and day out, night in and night out, Jehovah was leading! He never slumbered nor slept. Anyone, looking out of his tent at night, might see the pillar of fire. That indicated that God was there! He was there moment by moment during the darkness of the night, watching over His people. In the morning they may have to decamp and move on to another encampment. God directed that; He was the Leader in that. Some young Levite might say, I carried this part of the tabernacle to the last encampment; I will not carry it now. Can you not picture that happening in the desert? That, and worse, happened. Another one says. Look at Aaron and Moses; they are everything; we are nothing in their eyes. You would not have thought they would say that when they came out of Egypt, but God is leading them in the wilderness in a contrary scene to humble them. We do not like to be humbled. We rather like to be exalted, but God says. You need to be humbled; you need to be proved to bring out what is in your heart. That is going on in every one of us to bring out what is in our hearts. God, of course, is ashamed of us when it comes out. And the saints have to withdraw from young people, because of evil conduct issuing from their hearts. It is shameful! It brings dishonour! The saints cannot walk with them if there is the allowance of disobedience, worldliness and lust.
In due time Israel is led to Kadesh-barnea, and the spies brought back their wonderful testimony of the land; yet all Israel, except two men, turned against it
{531}
and despised the pleasant land. They refused to listen to the gospel of heaven; and God told them they would be strewn in the desert. What was in their hearts was brought to light; six hundred thousand of them exposed by that one thing! And may I say to every young person here, it will be disclosed too, by something or other, as to whether you are keeping the commandments or not. God is concerned whether His commandments are kept or not, and He is leading His people to humble them, and to prove them, to know what is in their heart, whether they will keep his commandments or not. How many young people come through that test? Alas, for the number of casualties! The devil ensnares many by the world or other things, and their hearts are exposed -- they are not keeping the commandments. It thus becomes a matter of public knowledge; it had been there, secretly, in the heart; now it is on the surface and apparent. God has done it. But then, if the testing proves that you *are* keeping the commandments, the heart of the Lord is pleased and the brethren are pleased, too. But alas! how many have their own way, with the sorrowful result as seen with the Israelites -- their carcases were strewn in the desert!
The epistles to the Corinthians bring all this up, the apostle naming the different elements of sinfulness in the people. He says, for example, "Neither be ye idolaters, as some of them; as it is written. The people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play", @1 Corinthians 10:7. One may say that is not idolatry; but that is exactly what the Spirit of God calls idolatry. They did that when Moses was absent from the camp. They sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play in idolatry; they had made the golden calf; they wanted to go back to Egypt, and to make themselves a captain. Many of us do not ask for a captain; each makes himself the captain and thinks himself competent enough to judge, so as to turn and go back to Egypt. This is a
{532}
most solemn thing, because it is God leading His people and humbling them to bring out what is in their hearts, whether they will keep the commandments or not.
Well, I could say much more about this scripture because it is one of the most remarkable chapters in the Old Testament. It treats of the richness of the land of Canaan, also. In verse 16 it says, "... who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end (@Deuteronomy 8:16)". That includes the beautiful land which is also described. There is no less thought in God's mind than to do us good, but He says, I will bring out what is in your hearts. He is not judging sin as in your heart; He will allow that to come out; He will bring it out by trial; but also, by giving you the manna to eat. He says. It is not that I want to expose you; I want to do you good. You may have to wait for it, for in truth it is the latter end; the chapter depicts the land. What good there was in it! What richness! That is the latter end that God had in view for His people.
Coming to the verses in Peter, we have a wilderness setting. The people are viewed as in the dispersion. The word "dispersion" implies an action of others; you do not disperse yourself. For example, the Emperor Claudius commanded all Jews to leave Rome, that illustrates how these things happen. Aquila and Priscilla were found in Corinth because of that edict; they were dispersed from Rome. And so in @Acts 8, on account of the persecution, the saints were scattered from Jerusalem. That was a great trial! Peter speaks here of a fiery one; a terrible persecution that arose. These people are dispersed; they have been scattered from their homes, where they were born and brought up; they are dispersed by some power. The Lord had anticipated the day when Jerusalem would be compassed about with armies. One thinks of the brethren in
{533}
Jerusalem in those days, when the Roman general came to attack and destroy it. The Lord had said, When you see that, leave Jerusalem. It happened in the year A.D. 70. The Lord's words were, "When ye see Jerusalem encompassed with armies, then know that its desolation is drawn nigh. Then let those ... who are in the midst of it depart ... for these are days of avenging", (@Luke 21:20 - 22). The city of the great King was to be razed to the ground, and there it is until the present time. Although it is still called Jerusalem, having now a considerable population, from the Lord's point of view it is in desolation, and the Jews are carried captive, until the time of the nations are fulfilled. They are about to be fulfilled; they are not finished yet, and therefore Jerusalem is still in desolation and the Jews are in captivity. The "dispersion" had this character. Peter says, "Beloved, take not as strange the fire of persecution which has taken place amongst you for your trial, as if a strange thing was happening to you", @1 Peter 4:12. It was a fiery trial.
The first trial was in divine leadership, and it relates to the whole period of our sojourn in the wilderness - it covered the full forty years. We are apt to be irksome under it, but God ordains trial to prove us, to bring out what is in our hearts. It is going on all the time. The Acts and the epistles show in many instances how God allowed the testings in the early days and how many went back. Take a man like Demas, for example. Paul, in writing to the Colossians, includes Demas in the salutation, chapter 4:14, but in writing to Timothy, later, he says, "Demas has forsaken me", @2 Timothy 4:10. Why did he forsake Paul? Because he loved the present world. How many have gone back like that! The Lord says, "because lawlessness shall prevail, the love of the most shall grow cold", (@Matthew 24:12). We must be watchful that we do not allow the trial to cause our love to wax cold. Keep near the brethren. "Provoke one
{534}
another to love and to good works (@Hebrews 10:24)". That is a fine service! How necessary it is, for, as we have said, the love of the most shall grow cold. Continual pressure is apt to cause that, and particularly, if we stay away from the meetings. There is no surer evidence of love waning than staying away from the meetings. The circle of the saints is the circle of love; it is where love is: "*We* know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren", (@1 John 3:14). The question is often asked. How do I "lay hold of eternal life"? Paul exhorts us to do so, (@1 Timothy 6:12). Is it in the air? Not at all. It is among the brethren. And again "lay hold of what is really life", (@1 Timothy 6:19). Where do you get it? Among the brethren. Keep as near as you can to them; and the more you desire to be among them, the more you have opportunity to do so. Eternal life is in Christ, but realised by the Spirit. Disregard of the assembly, the circle of spiritual affections, robs us of it. So that there is a great need of this warning. Constant pressure is apt to chill our love. Keep near the brethren; it is salvation. God says, "I will give salvation in Zion", (@Isaiah 46:13); and eternal life He commands there, @Psalm 133:3.
My point in this second feature of my subject is the trial of our *faith* . It took forty years to bring out what was in their hearts; God did it Himself. Every one of their hearts was exposed, whether they would obey God or not. God saw to that; and as I said before, six hundred thousand of them fell in the wilderness; they would not keep the law of God; they rebelled. But Peter speaks about faith: "the proving of your faith, much more precious than of gold which perishes", @1 Peter 1:7. Maybe some of us have never thought that we have something in our bosoms more precious than gold. It is not *the* faith here, it is *your* faith; and God is trying that faith. It is not now to bring out the naughtiness of our hearts, but to bring out the faith that is in
{535}
our hearts. That is what this testing is for. That is worth accepting. Look at that treasure in the morning when you get up; see if it is going to be any larger in the evening. The idea is increase in quality and quantity. And hence "the proving of your faith" -- not the proving of your feelings or the naughtiness of your heart -- but the proving of your faith; the thing that God has put there. He says it is more precious than gold. It is incomparable in that sense. Gold is nothing to it; it perishes, but faith does not. It is a precious commodity; and God says, I am testing it; it is "the proving of your faith". I believe if we look into our treasuries daily we shall see how the matter stands. And God has in mind the future; that our faith may "be found to praise and glory and honour in the revelation of Jesus Christ", verse 7. You have some little thing there in the way of wealth, and God is testing you so that you should have it in abundance, and that it should advance in quality and quantity; even though it is tried by fire. A fiery trial is not easy to bear; it is apt to produce scepticism. Why does God allow this? I know of saints questioning the rightness of loved ones falling asleep. How serious! You may say, I prayed that he should not be taken away; but then God intended to take him, and our prayers should be based on God's will. I have been thinking lately of the many bases there are for prayer. One is the *will of God* . "My Father, if it be possible let this cup pass from me; but not as *I* will, but as *thou* wilt", (@Matthew 26:39). That is one principle. Another principle or basis for prayer is *promise* . If God has made a promise. He will stand by it; go to Him with the promises; He is ready to listen to you. Another basis for prayer is *God's love* for His people. He regards an appeal to Him on account of His love to them. Yet another basis for prayer is the sovereign *counsel of God* ; God will listen to prayer based on that. I mention these things so as to help us
{536}
in our prayers; that we may not be rebellious. We must pray in intelligence as to His will.
Peter, here, is speaking about faith. He says to the saints, addressing them as in the dispersion, "Wherein ye exult, for a little while at present, if needed, put to grief by various trials", verse 6. One is challenged by that in all this terrible thing that is current. Peter says of these people that were in dispersion, scattered from their homes, put to grief by various trials, "Wherein ye exult". That is what I want to know; am I able to rejoice in the pressure. And the passage goes on to say, "that the proving of your faith, much more precious than of gold which perishes, though it be proved by fire, be found to praise and glory and honour in the revelation of Jesus Christ". We are now in the making. This is a most remarkable time. For Christians, it is the great making time. God is making us -- forming us -- and the point I am stressing now is faith. Do I have any? The Lord would say to the true believer: *Your* faith. Not simply faith, but *your* faith. He said to the woman in Simon's house, "Thy faith has saved thee; go in peace", (@Luke 7:50). He would say to you. You have it; look into your treasury and see that it is there. The fiery trial is intended to bring it into evidence and strengthen it, it is so precious. And it is to "be found to praise and glory and honour in the revelation of Jesus Christ": it is the occasion, from our side, of the glorious scene marking the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ. One has often tried to visualise the heavenly city. What a thing it is! It is a cube, composed of people of this kind, those who exercise faith now, and come under trial, that this precious thing might be effective and shine.
Well now, I go on to Abraham. I want to show how the Spirit of God treats this matter of Abraham's trial. The other two phases represent trials of all the saints. Abraham's is one man's trial; nobody else was tried like
{537}
this, and I suppose I can likewise say that everyone of us has some trial that is his own. I have had one -- indeed many -- and each of us as he looks back on his history will, no doubt, find he has had a trial of his own. This was Abraham's trial. Certain things had happened; and as you look at the twenty-first chapter you will see particularly what did happen. I cannot go into that now, but it says, "And it came to pass after these things". Something happens in my history that is in view of such a trial; it is allowed that I should be equal to the trial when it comes. So the passage says, "And it came to pass after these things, that God tried Abraham, and said to him, Abraham! and he said, Here am I. And he said. Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah, and there offer him up for a burnt-offering on one of the mountains which I will tell thee of", @Genesis 22: 1,2. This is a trial of affection. It is an act of faith. As we read in Hebrews, "By faith, Abraham, when tried, offered up Isaac, and he who had received to himself the promises offered up his only begotten son", @Hebrews 11:17. It was the only begotten; the one in whom all the promises were vested; and Abraham offered him up. It was Abraham's trial. Isaac was the supreme object of Abraham's affections.
Now, dear brethren, what about this? I am tried in some matter of my affections. If I set my affections on some person or thing, God will try me as to it. He would ask. Is it more to you than I am to you? That is the principle. It is the keenest trial, you might say, of all, because you have no one to sympathise with you. It is *your* trial. It is between you and God. God says to Abraham, I want Isaac; I want you to offer him up as a burnt-offering. He does not mitigate the matter in the least. He says, "Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, Isaac". The whole matter is stated in the tersest way by God Himself. It is intended to press
{538}
the thing home on Abraham's affections. This is the object of your affections. He would say, and I want him; are you willing to let Me have him? or do you think more of him than you do of Me? Do you love that object so much that you will not let Me have him? That was the trial! "And it came to pass after these things", so that, dear brethren, if there be any little spiritual progress in our souls, you may be sure some great test will come. "And Abraham" we are told, "rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he clave the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose up and went to the place that God had told him of", verse 3. I do not need to go over the verses; they are most beautiful, most affecting.
Now, it goes on to say, "On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar". Think of the position! Isaac speaking to him there; they went on and conversed together. And then it says, "And Abraham said to his young men. Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you", @Genesis 22:5. He is not going to lose Isaac, that was not in his mind. He was ready to sacrifice him and he *did* sacrifice him, for he raised his hand with the knife to kill him on the altar, but God held back that hand. He said, "Abraham, Abraham! ... Stretch not out thy hand against the lad", @Genesis 22:11. But what I want to stress is that the Spirit of God says, "he received him", @Hebrews 11:19. In all these trials God intends us to *receive* something. In this case, Abraham received Isaac back from the dead; not simply from the altar, but from the *dead* . Well, if I receive him back from the dead, I may say I have him for ever; and that is the principle. It all merges in what we receive back from the dead; I get into the realm of resurrection; thus through divine testing the believer is gradually led into the realm of resurrection. Think of what Lazarus was
{539}
to the two sisters in Bethany! "Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died", they said, (@John 11:21). They would retain him as before -- Lazarus, born as their brother -- but now they receive him back from the dead. Was there ever such a Lazarus? Did any other sister ever have such a brother? Now they have him, received back from the dead. God has in mind a state of things morally set up in resurrection; the great result of all this trial. We are not to be suffering all the time, but coming into the realm of resurrection where all is joy, eternally. This is a wonderful thought! One would like to be able to enlarge on it; but that is what is stated; Abraham received Isaac back from the dead in a figure. It would fill Abraham's soul with new light, so that after these things you get further great things as to him. In chapter 23 we are told that he buried Sarah, evidently in faith, for the field and cave which Abraham purchased was the burying-place of those who had faith in view of resurrection. In chapter 24 he sends out his servant for a wife for Isaac. It is the progress of faith, on the line of trial. God will bring out what He has placed in us according to its value in His own eyes, for He has in view "to do thee good at thy latter end".
