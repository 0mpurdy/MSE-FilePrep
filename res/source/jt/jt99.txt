THE BELIEVER IN THE PLACE OF TESTIMONY
@Genesis 19: 27 - 29; @Genesis 21: 8, 9; @Genesis 22: 9 - 13; @Genesis 24: 61 - 67
J.T. My object in proposing these scriptures is that we might see how the believer comes into the assembly in the place of testimony here, that is, Sarah's tent as the position of testimony. Other scriptures may come into view besides those read. I would first call attention to the judgment of the world, which helps us to understand in a preliminary way the position of the church in the world. Then in chapter 20, which is familiar to us all, God calls the attention of the Philistine king to Abraham, that is, to His people here in faith, as it is said, "Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm", @1 Chronicles 16: 22. It is God intervening, and giving the believer room in the world. "God is not ashamed to be called their God", @Hebrews 11: 16. Then in chapter 21 we have the promised seed owned fully in the household of faith; a feast is made for him when he is weaned; that is, Christ's Person is seen in full view. In chapter 22 the idea of resurrection comes in; in chapter 23 the death of Sarah; that is, the decease of Israel in the place of testimony, and in chapter 24 Christ and the church Rebecca *is led* into Sarah's tent.
E.W. Why do you emphasise the judgment of the world?
J.T. It must precede the formation of the church in the new position as the vessel of testimony. The church is consequent on that, this world is already judged: the Lord Jesus said, "Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out". And in @John 16 the Spirit is to "bring demonstration to the world, of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment". Therefore it is a judged
{2}
world that we witness in, which makes the position of the believer in the world serious. God has judged it, and we take the issue of God's judgment.
E.W. It would help to deliver us from this present evil world which is dominated by the wicked one if we saw that God has judged it.
Ques. What is the position of Abraham in these chapters?
J.T. In the early section of chapter 18 the heavenly man is brought out, who is able to entertain divine Persons here. God had enjoined circumcision, and Jehovah went up from talking with Abraham (chapter 17: 22). Abraham carried out the injunction exactly the selfsame day. Then we see him in a certain position at Mamre honoured with three visitors, Jehovah and two others, whom he entertained. Then follows the announcement of Isaac in the next year. Then Abraham's priestly qualifications are seen in his interceding for Sodom because of the righteous man in that city. Abraham was accounted righteous on the principle of faith; he was a righteous priest. He goes from fifty down to ten, and God owns his priestly intercession. All this takes place in response to Abraham; he sees the judgment from this standpoint. Every believer ought to take this standpoint. The world is bad; God has judged it after the intercession of Abraham to save it.
Ques. Is it essential, in order to take our place intelligently in the assembly, to begin with judgment regarding the world?
J.T. You see things as God sees them from that point of view; Abraham stood where he had stood before Jehovah.
Ques. You would try and link up the church and the world otherwise?
J.T. You would save the world if you could. Abraham was not wanting in patience in view of the righteous, but there were not ten found. When the
{3}
Lord destroyed the cities wherein Lot dwelt, He remembered Abraham, and sent out Lot. It brings out what Abraham was; he would save the world if it could be saved. He had power with God; Lot was saved through his intercession.
-. S. It is a very serious thing and should affect us much that God has judged the world.
J.T. God spared Lot. He "is longsuffering ... not willing that any should perish".
-.S. Abraham was with God about the matter.
J.T. That is the ground we all take as believers, and from that standpoint get God's view of the world as judged; Abraham saw the smoke go up from there. There is no question about it.
-.K. The judgment was more fully seen in Christ's death.
J.T. The Father and the Spirit all bring condemnation on it. In @John 12 we have the death of Christ "I, if I be lifted up out of the earth, will draw all to me". Then the Spirit, when He comes, will convince the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment (@John 16: 8). Then there is the epistle of John. The judgment is evident, for the smoke goes up as the smoke of a furnace. The Holy Spirit has come in and brought demonstration into the world by means of the saints; at Pentecost they were convicted. There are those in whom the Spirit today convicts the world. Anyone going into it is doubly responsible as there are those through whom the Spirit convicts.
M.W.B. Corinthians begins with the cross of Christ as the ground for refusing the world. Then the Spirit refuses the world; so in a double sense we are responsible not to go into it.
J.T. In another place Paul says he is crucified to it and it to him. That is a further thought.
M.W.B. Before one can entertain the thought of the church with reference to testimony, one must see
{4}
that the world is judged, and the double demonstration of it in the witness of the Spirit.
J.T. It is the sphere of judgment; therefore it is doubly serious to go into it.
F.W. Have you any thought why Abraham is allowed to go down to Gerar?
J.T. It is so in the overruling of God. He went down into Egypt; God allowed that in His overruling. I think it affords an opportunity to bring out what He thinks of Abraham; we should not have known that God called him a prophet but for that. It shows God's thoughts of him, and also brings out what we get in another place, "Touch not mine anointed ones, and do my prophets no harm", @1 Chronicles 16:22. He would tell the Philistine king His thoughts of Abraham through this occasion. Abraham is superior to him. Chapters 20 and 21 bring out the place the man of faith has with God. He is a prophet, and is in moral superiority over Abimelech; he gives him sheep, and he reproves him. He puts seven ewe-lambs by themselves, indicative of the spirit of Abraham, as witness that he did dig the well; that is on the line of Romans, overcoming evil with good. It shows how the man of faith qualifies to occupy the church position in the place of testimony; superior to what Israel ever was.
J.O.S. We need to learn that the world as a system is judged before we can understand the assembly.
J.T. What the world is has come out through the Lord's presence here; what it really is. The presence of Christ here tested it.
J.O.S. The world as a system lies in the wicked one.
F.W. We need encouragement if we have been on the downward grade to see that God will never depart from the anointing; He has in view our recovery.
J.T. God is justified in what He had accomplished; Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and all his people. Abraham was a priest, for he had spoken to God about Sodom; now he prayed for
{5}
Abimelech, and God answered him. What a great place faith has in a world that is judged! God can go on with the world provisionally, and the gospel can be presented to it. It is a great honour to faith. God calls the attention of the king to Abraham in that way. It shows the place we have in relation to the world; we pray for those in it. What moral superiority it gives to the Christian! After Isaac is recognised and Ishmael cast out chapter 21 brings out how Abraham is growing in moral power. It is no use to talk of the testimony aside from moral power; or of the church position, if my business affairs are not right. It is the poorest thing to be only nominally in the position as Israel was. There must be practical righteousness.
M.W.B. Is that why the elder must "have a good report of them which are without", because he stands in a certain public position in connection with the testimony?
J.T. They look at you, of course.
M.W.B. You learn to overcome evil with good.
J.T. Stephen was known as a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit. The armour of Romans is the armour of light, and it is connected with righteousness. There is no light in anyone aside from righteousness.
"Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness", @Psalm 132: 9. You cannot pray in the prayer meeting for the nations unless you are clothed in righteousness.
J.O.S. That is why it says in @Romans 13, "Owe no one anything".
Rem. The injunction in @2 Timothy 2 is "Pursue righteousness ..."; righteousness is first.
Jos.T. To be here for the will of God would be fulfilling righteousness, would it not?
J.T. The Lord says, "Thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness". And in Romans we read, "In order that the righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh but according to Spirit". Before the world we
{6}
must be characterised by righteousness. In John eternal life is the testimony, in Romans righteousness.
J.O.S. Righteousness involves being subject to our limitations: they come in as the will of God, and we learn to accept them.
M.W.B. Why did you emphasise the weaning of Isaac?
J.T. The thought is that we should be detached from the natural. The setting is John's gospel. In @John 2 the Lord's mother says to Him, "They have no wine". His answer is, "What have I to do with thee, woman? mine hour has not yet come". He was detached from her. Faith begins to see Christ apart from what He was here in the natural setting. The Lord alludes to this when He says, "Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad". Christ being detached from the natural should so affect us that we should not be so under its sway.
Rem. In @Genesis 22 we have the offering up of Isaac. Even he has to go.
J.T. The weaning is not so far as that; that is a further thought. The weaning is that we are detached from the natural. "Though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more". And even He has to go in death, and be offered up, to reach the thought of God. He has to be surrendered in death. Abraham received Isaac back from the dead in figure. That is what the believer has. He is filled up with Christ! Full of Christ he can come into the place of testimony here.
M.W.B. That is how you view the history of Abraham: what the believer has.
J.T. These chapters bring out how the man of faith, the heavenly man, qualifies for the place of testimony, that is, Sarah's tent. It must be occupied; it cannot be empty. Men of faith, heavenly men, are to occupy it and grace the position. What do you think, Mr. W.?
{7}
E.W. That would be further progress made by those who see the world is judged. I am following with interest what you say.
J.T. The natural is the old things: "Old things have passed away". We may have faith, but it takes us a long time to get clear of the natural. Even Abraham wanted to retain Ishmael in spite of the mother and the mocking.
J.O.S. Does he get clear of the natural when he calls on the name of the eternal God?
J.T. Quite so. Eternal is in contrast with natural.
E.W. The natural is often a great hindrance to us in spiritual relationships.
J.T. You will find in the most spiritual that adjustment as to the natural is needed. It is so hard to get rid of. But it hides the full position of Rebecca; she was *led* into it; it is a position we take up from the divine side. We are *led* into that position. The Lord led His disciples as far as Bethany, to that point. That is not fully Sarah's tent; Rebecca is the full thought of the church. The church is not a remnant of something else; it is something entirely new, though there were a few at the beginning who were a remnant of Israel; the testimony was continued on for some time in that setting. Rebecca is the full thought of the church, Paul's church, not the pentecostal church.
W.J.T. Would that correspond with the epoch of Abraham, who was the heavenly man?
J.T. From Abel to Noah we have men for the earth. "While the earth remaineth", there would be certain conditions. Noah was recovered for the earth, then God called out another man, who was to be heavenly, alluding to the church. Noah was not that. Isaac was offered up upon the mountain; there is no record that he came down. He occupies that place alone, and the church is brought to Him. She is taken into Sarah's tent by the heavenly man.
E.W. She is "of Christ", of His kindred.
{8}
Ques. Would you say a word about the pentecostal church?
J.T. The pentecostal church is not that seen in @Revelation 21; that is the external view built on the foundation of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. Their ministry is there. See the grace and liberty she has! Rebecca is led into Sarah's tent. You have the full thought there.
F.W. The Pentecostal church, I suppose, is based on Peter's ministry.
Jos.T. Would Sarah's tent be like Paul's hired lodging in the end of the Acts, when he received all who came unto him and spoke to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God?
J.T. His testimony was that the salvation of God was sent to the gentiles. Sarah's tent is a definite place of witness; a well-known place occupied by the church.
M.W.B. Isaac led her into that from his exalted plane.
J.T. The servant's name is not given. It was not Eliezer (as is generally supposed); he was a domestic, a servant of the house; Abraham spoke of him as "this Eliezer of Damascus". In chapter 24 the servant chosen is said to be the eldest of his house, the ruler over all that he had. That is a big thing; and he was a person of great dignity, over his house. He was put under the solemn charge of not taking Isaac back.
That is Paul's ministry. Christ is not taken out of heaven, but as the heavenly Man, the church is brought to Him. Then we have Isaac coming into the field to meditate at evening; that is, Christ represented in perspective for faith. Rebecca springs down off the camel. The Spirit of God depicts so beautifully the heavenly position. She is led into Sarah's tent for testimony.
M.W.B. Meeting with Isaac is the heavenly position; she comes from there to the place of testimony
{9}
previously occupied by Israel. That is the peculiar position of Sarah's tent. It is reached on coming down, not on coming out of Syria.
J.T. From chapter 15, as we move on in faith we are led on to that ground.
B.A.H. To be a comfort to Christ. Sometimes we are not.
J.O.S. The last few verses of @John 15 concerning the Spirit as the Comforter and the Witness, and "ye too bear witness", would cover the beginning. Then Paul's testimony follows.
Rem. It would enhance the character of the testimony if it is carried out by those who are heavenly.
J.T. We see what a great place the church has.
She was of Isaac's kindred. Before the servant set out to find her she was known to be there. At the end of @Genesis 22 it was told to Abraham that she was there, in the line of Nahor.
Rem. You feel that the testimony goes out, but we need to be exercised as to how far we testify on that line.
J.T. The gospel is preached on the line that Rebecca is there. That is the point in the genealogy in the end of @Genesis 22. It was told Abraham that Micah had borne eight sons to Nahor; and the Spirit of God adds, "And Bethuel begat Rebecca". She was there. No preacher would doubt that; he must get her. The church is brought to Christ that way. Isaac is out of sight; he does not come down from the mountain; the Holy Spirit presents things in that way to us. Abraham was told about her; and he must get her.
Rem. That is what the man of faith does.
M.W.B. The omissions of Scripture are very wonderful. That is the point of view the Spirit wishes to emphasise.
J.T. That is the way Scripture presents things.
{10}
F.H. The Lord said to Paul about Corinth, "I have much people in this city".
J.T. Paul did not labour in vain.
Ques. Would you say a little more on the difference between leading Rebecca to Isaac, and Isaac leading her to the tent?
J.T. Christ will give us our place in the testimony. It is not so much the line there; she is led into the tent; she became his wife and he loved her; these are general facts mentioned. The Lord fixes our position; He must dispose of us. Rebecca was leadable; she did not say, 'This tent is not suitable; I want a better tent than that'. It is a question of the Lord disposing of us.
E. W. Does the thought of union enter into this?
J.T. Oh, yes. "It is not good that Man should be alone; I will make him a help-mate, his like". But Christ as the heavenly Man is in dignity, self-contained.
Isaac felt the loss of his mother, Israel. He had come from the well Beer-lahai-roi; he had plenty of resources. At eventide he was walking in the fields to meditate. When the servant said, "That is my master!", she recognises his position and acts becomingly. He leads her into his mother's tent. The Lord is assigning the church her place here in testimony. Not that He is going to reside with her there always, but she is to take up that position.
F. W. "Behold, I and the children which God has given me"; Jehovah had given them to Messiah.
J.T. That does not take you off Israel's ground. Rebecca is a new person to take up the position of testimony. It is not the final position.
Rem. The servant had so magnified his master that she, on meeting him, covers herself.
J.T. The thought is that Abraham was his master, carried forward in Isaac. All that we know of God is in Christ; we never regard Christ in any other light.
{11}
"That all may honour the Son, even as they honour the Father".
M.W.B. In Colossians the greatness of the Person is brought before us. The church here in Israel's position comes into that.
J.T. It is well to keep in mind that it is another, not Sarah. She is brought in the Spirit's power to another man. When she sees Isaac, she springs off the camel. She does that in her own power.
Rem. So the tent is a provisional thought.
J.T. Israel will come into it again; but today the testimony runs on. Israel has been in that tent and will comes into it again; but it is now occupied by the church. The church holds it today as Israel could not hold it; we see the superiority of the church in every way over all other families.
H.W. The ark was in a tent provisionally, the tabernacle.
J.T. Yes; like that, it is a provisional thought and runs on. Israel was in the place of testimony, now it is taken up by the church. All we get in the Old Testament is seen in a greater way in the church than ever it could have been seen in Israel.
E.W. Perhaps it would help if you would say what is in your mind as to the testimony.
J.T. It is what God set out.
E.W. Is it what God has here?
J.T. It is illustrated in @Ephesians 2: 4, "God, who is rich in mercy" and "His great love". They are seen in the way He has taken us out of death. We were "dead in trespasses and sins", far away from God, degraded. But without anything to commend us to God, God has quickened us. That is what God has done. *He* does it. "God ... has raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus", in order to set forth the riches of His grace. He has prepared good works beforehand that we should walk in them.
{12}
E. W. It is God's work; He started it and He will finish it.
J.T. It is seen in the assembly, which is Christ's body.
M.W.B. If it is not diverting you from what you have before you, may I ask what is the connection of eternal life with the testimony? You referred to it earlier in John's epistle.
J.T. That is a very important matter, and one we all need help on. You will have noticed that the Lord touches the subject in @John 3 where it is a question of dealing with our state. He says, "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus must the Son of man be lifted up, that every one who believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal". That, of course, refers to the brazen serpent. In @Numbers 20 the children of Israel, after they had drunk water from the rock which Moses smote twice, instead of speaking to it (nevertheless the waters gushed out), send a personal message to Edom, saying, "Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country"; we will pay our way, go on our own feet, by the king's highway, and so on. In great dignity they tell Edom all that God has been to them; how He brought them out of Egypt, and led them through the wilderness. But Edom refused, so they had to go by the way of the Red Sea and round the territory of Edom. Now suppose the brethren ask me to do something unreasonable; for Edom compelled Israel to take a detour round by the Red Sea. Well, Israel were grieved, and complained, and spoke against God and against Moses! You can hardly credit it! It indicates that people who could send that beautiful address to Edom spoke against the God who had been so good to them! The incident brings out something that was there, that they did not know was there, that was very bad. We are capable even at the advanced stage of christianity of speaking against God! We have not discerned
{13}
yet how bad we are, and what we are capable of! Even a spiritual man, who could go on his own feet, and pay his way, if the brethren ask him to do something unreasonable, speaks against God and against His servant! Therefore the fiery serpents are sent, which bite the people, and they were perishing. Then the serpent of brass was lifted up. It is the terrible state of the flesh that we are so slow to discern. The Lord alludes to this when He says, "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus must the Son of man be lifted up, that every one who believes on him may ... have life eternal". It is a question of life in the sense of fulness of joy and superiority over death. The testimony of John is that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.
M.W.B. We become available thus in testimony here in the world on behalf of God.
J.T. Those who enjoy it.
Rem. It is a living testimony in the saints, and is the result of arriving at that judgment.
J.T. "*We* know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren".
Rem. The love of the brethren becomes a testimony.
J.T. John says, 'I write unto you because ye know'. That word 'know' is conscious knowledge. The saints *know* they are in superiority, because they love the brethren.
Rem. Israel was in the place of testimony; now we become the testimony.
J.T. See how these christians love one another!
M.W.B. I like that thought. Then as we are in the enjoyment of spiritual things now we are brought into the region of the testimony.
J.T. In @John 3: 12, "Earthly things" refer to the serpent being lifted up, "heavenly things" to eternal life. Heavenly things belong to the One who has ascended up. He has been down and has been "lifted up". That is the fulness of the thought.
{14}
M.W.B. That is a matter of concern and spiritual apprehension to link eternal life to the One who is in heaven.
J.O.S. In @John 6 the Lord Jesus says, "Doth this offend you? What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?". The Lord suggests that everything is outside flesh and blood condition.
J.T. He belongs to Canaan. Eternal life is for the earth. We are blessed "with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ". They are enhanced in us while they are not seen in Israel. But they will be by and by.
Rem. John desires that our joy may be full. Lack of joy is the cause of testimony being so poor.
J.T. Eternal life is the blessing. It is difficult to appreciate it if we have not discovered what we are capable of, that is, speaking against God and against Moses!
E.W. What have you in mind about chapter 22?
J.T. That is to bring out that the heavenly man, that is, Christ after the flesh, must be surrendered in death vicariously if faith is to reach the goal. It is a supreme test to Abraham, but he answers to the test, and heaven speaks to him twice; thus it becomes one of the great landmarks in Scripture. You too have to pass that way. Sarah dies. We have to go that way if we make any headway. I think Abraham understands eternal life, because he is seeing about burying her. Why does he want to bury her? Faith sees resurrection. In the light of faith Isaac is raised; that is, Christ is in heaven; we bury our dead in the full confidence that they will be raised.
M.W.B. "I will raise him up at the last day"?
J.T. The whole of chapter 23 is taken up with the burial of Sarah. The field is bought, the trees bought, not for display; the field is bought for the cave that is in it, that Abraham may bury his dead out of his sight. The field becomes the occasion of the display
{15}
of eternal life. Nowhere does life come into evidence more than at a burial; it is for testimony and display. The brethren are there; they are not under the power of death; they are living. You bury in faith. You bury a person because he will be raised, in view of the resurrection. The hymns are hymns of praise and victory, for display of the testimony of divine power.
Saints are buried in the light of resurrection. Else if there is no resurrection (as some say) Paul says, "Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die". But it is not so. Tomorrow we shall be raised. The trees are for shelter.
M.W.B. In the light of resurrection you would say it is very unbecoming for a Christian to be cremated.
J.T. Oh, certainly. Burial is the thing, because they "shall come forth", superior to death. Sarah is the first person buried.
J.O.S. Hebron is the light of another world.
J.T. Hebron has in view the cave of Machpelah. "All these died in faith".
J.O.S. They had a view of "the land" afar off.
J.T. @Genesis 23 is introduced into @Hebrews 11, and into the section of the bush. Jehovah said to Moses, "I am ... the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob". The Lord Jesus tells us that God "is not God of the dead but of the living-, for all live for him". They were living though they had all been buried. That is the realm of life of @Hebrews 11.
Rem. "Abraham rose up from before his dead".
J.T. That shows the power he had. Jacob "gathered his feet into the bed, and expired". It shows the power of life in the saints. It is only a little while we shall be buried. That is faith's point, and the believer has it.
Rem. The testimony is before all who went in at the gate of the city.
{16}
J.T. Verse 17 describes the position. It was a great public testimony. Why does he buy the field and trees? Faith is the answer. There is nothing without it. We live in the faith period. "Without faith it is impossible to please him". We are "risen with him through the faith of the operation of God". We come into it by faith-into all we have spoken of.
{17}
FIELDS
@1 Corinthians 3: 6 - 9; @Genesis 27: 26, 27; @Proverbs 24: 27
I have the scriptures in Corinthians especially in mind, and have read in the Old Testament to amplify, and perhaps clarify, what is said there by the apostle. The scriptures taken together treat of the idea of a field, that is a portion of the earth which is set apart as profitable, which may be sown in and reaped with a view to a crop. The thought of a field has a wide and varied meaning in Scripture. In @Matthew 13: 38, for instance, it is said to be the world, so that it is very wide, the world viewed as capable of cultivation, capable of receiving seed and producing a crop. Then we find it also as containing treasure secured by purchase, so that rights are acquired over it. Then we find it in many other connections, that is as characteristic of what is convertible, the beasts of the field. We find, as already alluded to today, the field of Ephron, a field that commands peculiar interest as, whilst it is a burying-place, it points to resurrection. A wide area is secured, at least an area called a field, called that several times, and the trees in it, all that was in it secured with care, money paid out for it, a testimony as we have already had today to the power of God, whilst it has the grave too, in the light of the death and resurrection of Christ, who as it is said, annulled death and brought life and incorruptibility to light through the gospel. That is the field, whether it be where the saints as together bury a loved one, or whether it be whence the saints who are buried come forth at the quickening word of Christ to resurrection, to life. The Lord through redemption has rights, which He now uses in respect of the burial of loved ones, for they are all His, His dead, but as "the section of the bush" proves, as He called it Himself,
{18}
it is the life realm, all live to Him, He says. God is not the God of the dead but of the living, so they are all as good as raised. Faith understands that and that field will glow in life and glory as the Lord Jesus descends from heaven and awakes the sleeping saints and changes the living. No one will see anything, the whole scene will be dominated by the power of God; no power can cope with that and we shall go up without any molestation or hindrance.
Then there is the field of Hanameel which Jeremiah bought, pointing to the future when fields and vineyards shall be bought and sold and the title-deeds secured. There are no title-deeds mentioned in regard to the purchase of the field of Ephron, but it is a public matter. We are told the price secured; it is a public matter secured to Abraham, secured to faith; in other words it cannot be infringed upon or interfered with, a matter that should be in our hearts as we bury our dead. The field of Hanameel, on the other hand, is sealed by writing, part sealed and part open. The deeds, as I may call them, are lodged in an earthen vessel, no doubt alluding to the living saints today who have the treasure in earthen vessels, keeping every thought of God in their hearts; whether for themselves or for Israel all the promises are yea and amen in Christ, cherished in the hearts of the saints now, so that the title deeds of the field are always secure. Everything thus is viewed, dear brethren, for us; victory is in all these things, but it is all a matter of faith, faith sustained in life by the power of the Spirit of God.
These two fields, as I said, present certain features, but the verses I have read refer to the saints, the saints viewed as a field, or husbandry. Husbandry is a similar thought, an area cultivated by God, and in which He is operating. Even in a debauched worldly city like Corinth God would have what He regards as His husbandry treasured. No one can infringe upon
{19}
it with impunity. As the apostle says, "Having in readiness to avenge all disobedience when your obedience shall have been fulfilled", @2 Corinthians 10: 6. There were those who were entrenching on the rights of God there, but they should come in for their deserts for God's husbandry is not to be touched by a foreign hand.
Well now, I want to comment on the verses in the Old Testament so as to lead up to this point, so that the brethren may see, whether it be in Cambridge or any other city or town or village where the saints are, that God has His husbandry. As the Lord Himself says in another setting, "My Father is the husbandman", a very solemn fact and yet very comforting, for a father suggests, grace, and yet severity. Love indeed must be severe where there is that which damages; it is not love to treat lightly that which may be in the child or the saint and which damages the vineyard or the husbandry. It is not love at all. There must be skill in the way love acts, but love will act with the utmost severity, as the apostle says, "I would that they would even cut themselves off who throw you into confusion". So the Lord announces to Paul, "I have much people in this city". That is what He alluded to, He had them, not yet actually, but potentially; that is to say, it was like a field, as I hope to show in a moment, a field prepared of the Lord. There is the smell of it, not yet a crop, but the smell, known to God, of a field that was to be fruitful. Now these remarks bring me to @Genesis 27, a well-known scripture and one which fits peculiarly in what I have in my mind; one may touch, in dealing with it, on the individual believer, in the manner in which Isaac regards his son. The affection conveyed in Isaac's invitation to his son is touching, and I need not remark that it is not a mere historical matter, but one to be used at any time, bearing indeed directly on us, for these two men so prominent in the chapter are,
{20}
as the sequel shows, the true or real brother and the false brother. This thought runs down the Scriptures from Genesis to Malachi, and indeed from Matthew to the Revelation, the thought of the genuine brother and the false brother. A comparison of the blessing will help us; the scripture says that Isaac blessed them both by faith, but a comparison of the blessing will show how the one is the real brother and the other the false, although Esau had every opportunity as every normal brother does. Heaven spares nothing that would help him, to make him real, so that Esau is blessed but he is not kissed, he is not said to be kissed, nor is he called near, and his blessing is just what he should have without any thought of giving, whereas Jacob's blessing is all a question of gift. Esau shares in great advantages in the fatness of the earth and the dew of heaven, but says Isaac, "It shall come to pass when thou rovest about, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck", that is Jacob's yoke. "When thou rovest about" meaning what we call loose or independent brothers. I am not saying they are not christians; I am only speaking of the character of roving about, no submission to heaven, or ordering by heaven; none takes his place by divine appointment, thus each becomes independent; he breaks off the appointed yoke, which is very common in our days, a thing to be avoided. Is anyone here on the line of roving about? It is a warning; you may think you have got liberty but it is simply independence. On the other hand Jacob is called near by faith, for now Isaac is in the full position of faith and blesses, as representative of God. He draws near, how touching for young people, how God would call you near. "Come near ... my son". Then he says, "See, the smell of my son", a word that has to be quoted because smell is a matter of great sense and helps as to decisions, the smell you find. Here it is the smell of a field which the Lord has blessed, that
{21}
is to say it is a christian, it is a christian acting in the divine nature, not yet perhaps having the crop in view, but potentially the thing is there. "The smell of my son is as the smell of a field which Jehovah hath blessed", pointing to a future crop, and what a crop!-the crop is sure to come. And in the end we have the solemn fact that Esau is hated; there is no crop. Jacob is loved. "I loved Jacob", alluding to what came out in his history, whereas Esau is hated, alluding to what came out in him. He had every opportunity to bear a crop, for God is wonderfully gracious to Esau making provision for him, as in the book of Deuteronomy he was not to be touched, but later the prophetic history denounces him. No nation is more denounced; we see God's hatred of falsity among brethren. So there is urgency that young brothers and sisters should see to it that there is the evidence initially, in our faith, of the blessing of God, that is to say that kind of blessing which ensures a crop and makes you worth while for the virtuous woman to add you to her territory. It says, "A woman of worth" in Proverbs; she considers a field, she does not take on any field. Esau was a man of the field but he is not said to be a field which the Lord has blessed; a common man, he is not himself a field. The point is today whether the person himself is a field, that is what Jacob was. Faith makes the person himself a field, something that God can cultivate with a view to the crop. There is always seed-time, and seed-time is utterly worthless unless there is harvest time, seed-time and harvest. Sowing seed, except we get a harvest, is futile, and there is no harvest except the field is blessed of the Lord. There must be the latent power and activity in the field and that can only be by the work of God; so the virtuous woman considers the field. That is, the brethren enquire about anyone who seems to be blessed of the Lord; she considers a field and then acquires it, not joining
{22}
"field to field" as we are told elsewhere, selfishly to add to our glory, but acquiring something for God that is the value of a field; the saints are of value in this respect; there is something, some crop, for God. God sows the seed of what He intends to secure; the earth is to bring forth. The farmer sows, but he does not know how the crop comes; the earth has latent power. There it is and the virtuous woman acquires a field: she has a crop in mind. Well now, that leads to Proverbs, to the verse I read. We are enjoined "Prepare thy work without, and put thy field in order", that is yourself according to what I am saying. The brethren of course are to look after you as you come into fellowship; we see there are elders in the church and they would have an eye to the field, but then the point here is yourself. You are a potential field; there is a crop in you, as it were, but initially something hinges on yourself, it is your own responsibility: "Prepare thy work without". It is a public matter evidently, I suppose including confession. No true lover of Jesus would fail to make known publicly his allegiance to Jesus, and he would have other public things in order, the regulation of his conduct, his business affairs, family affairs, and personal affairs, for remember too, there is a scrutinising eye in the assembly, so that a time will come for those eyes to look over you. In fact, you are better known in heaven than you may think, and in the assembly too, for they have been watching you; the field to be acquired. It may be that the time will come when you will have to show yourself, that is another thing. The Lord says to the cleansed leper, "Go, shew thyself to the priest". Jehovah says to Elijah, "Shew thyself to Ahab", as if to say, Elijah is a greater testimony after going through the experience of @1 Kings 17. Show yourself; God is concerned about our public appearances, and how much the question of practical righteousness enters into this! It is forced upon us
{23}
at the present time; so much has happened to discredit the testimony. The garment of the wife of the Lamb, the fine linen, is the righteousness of the saints. How dreadful is the opposite of that, unrighteousness of the saints; it is a dreadful, sorrowful, subject; so that one is to see to oneself. John says, "If ye know that he is righteous, know that every one who practises righteousness is begotten of him", @1 John 2: 29. It is a trait of the divine nature in us, so that you have this thought as I said, "Prepare thy work without, and put thy field in order, and afterwards build thy house". How much might be said of that, as applying to an individual christian! For building is by love in relation to the brethren; they build by love. "Love edifies". Let us not assume that without things being right publicly, things in order.
These remarks I think you will see, dear brethren, connect with the verses I have read in Corinthians, which verses contemplate the idea that I am speaking of, husbandry, or a farm, or a field, as collective, the saints collectively, not an individual but the saints as a whole in that town, and what brings the subject up in the apostle's mind is that there were partisan conditions in Corinth; such are wholly inimical to the idea of a crop. What can you have with such conditions? Where partisan conditions exist the door is open for the enemy; there were wicked persons in that meeting; it was in a vile state, so that the apostle is led on to speak about this matter of husbandry by the fact that some in the place were saying that they were of Paul, and others of Apollos, or perhaps other names which he does not use. Now Paul planted, that was all he did in this respect, a great work, of course. The Lord had told him that He had much people in that city, that is He had husbandry in His mind and Paul was to sow the seed which would bring in the crop, and the crop would come. It was a very fine work and took eighteen months, I suppose; the idea was to
{24}
see the time for a crop, seed-time and harvest. We must remember the harvest; so Paul stayed there eighteen months, and the crop was there. It says Paul planted, but Apollos came in; there was no divergence between Paul and Apollos. It is very beautiful to think of two labouring brothers united in their labours, just aiming at one thing, that is the crop. "The planter and the waterer are one": that is very fine. Oh, that that were so, that every one in the field today was actuated by that one thought. "The planter and the waterer are one". To illustrate the fact Paul says that he begged Apollos to go to Corinth and that he was not minded to go. You might think he was not one with Paul but he was; it was the depth of sympathy that he had, that he would not go lest there might be this very thing, putting him up against the apostle; love would not admit of that, taking advantage to obtain a reputation among them. It would quickly put him into prominence if he were to intimate that he was not quite with Paul, but he was with Paul. Thank God they were one, dear brethren. We must be on our guard against putting labouring brethren against each other in our minds; it is a sure way to put them against each other, even if they are not so already. It says, "comparing themselves with themselves"; it is not love doing this in regard of work being carried on. If a man can do a thing well and do it in love, let him do it, give him scope to do it; that is the principle. Paul had scope at the beginning and he planted; Apollos came in and he watered. It would look indeed as if in the Acts the apostle Paul was comforted as he arrived at Ephesus. I believe he had a sense that Apollos, as far as he could, was holding the ground for God in the husbandry. It is very beautiful when brethren can move thus. The planter and the waterer are one; the increase is from God. It may be planted and watered but there can be no increase without God, that is the
{25}
correct thought, it is what is for God, so that he says, "Ye are God's husbandry, God's building", that is what they were and the same thoughts apply as in @Proverbs 24, that the field is to be put in order. The enemy came in and damaged things at Corinth and so in many gatherings that one might name; the field has to be kept in order; love must prevail, whether in those who come and water, seeking to serve the saints, or whether in those that are prominent locally. The field has to be kept in order and I believe that is why the letters to Corinth are so full of order, so full of directions, the public aspect of things must be right. It is futile to talk about building unless we have public order, unless the field is right, so to speak; so you have the apostle giving instructions when he was there and he praised them because they kept them.
It is a question of the field. Then he wrote other instructions, and says, 'I will give you more when I come'. It is to keep the public state of things right, including practical righteousness and order and then the building. They were God's building, but there could not be much said about it; there was only the foundation but the foundation was there, thank God, and well laid. He was a wise architect who laid the foundation. "Other foundation can no man lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ". That is a question of apprehending, dear brethren, the kind of man in Christ, that is the foundation at Corinth, not the Son of God, Christ the Son of the living God as in Matthew; that is not the side presented. The foundation is the order of man that shone out in Christ, Jesus Christ. There is no other foundation; it is a public matter, what comes under man's eye. Paul could speak about the foundation being there; it was there. No one else could lay another, but as to the superstructure he could not say anything; he makes no special mention of that but he goes on as to building. Now building is by love, building or edifying
{26}
one another. Let each take heed how he builds; there is the thought of that in every locality, dear brethren. The word is as to the field, the husbandry, and then as to the building. The husbandry must be taken care of, the field must be put in order, which involves practical righteousness, and then the brethren getting together in love, edifying one another, as it says, in love.
Well, that was all I have to say, and I think you will have followed. The Lord is helping the brethren and is greatly desirous of building, as it says in Ephesians, a beautiful expression, being edified in love. It is a poor thing to be burdened, to have a beautiful house but with the lawn and garden and walks, everything in disorder, irregular; it is incongruous; have the field in order, have the public side in order, then the living conditions, the house, building in love, so that there is no incongruity about the position of any gathering, but everything pleasing to the eye of heaven.
{27}
PHASES OF DIVINE LOVE
@Genesis 22: 2; @Genesis 37: 3; @Exodus 21: 1 - 6; @Exodus 28: 1 - 4, 40 - 43
J.T. I thought it would be helpful if we have before us the great thought of love, and how it works out in dignified and holy service Godward. We have parental love in the first scripture, paternal love. Love originates in God, and in the New Testament the love of God for man is seen: "God so loved the world". It is parental love for His people as such. Then there is the love of Christ for each of us, for the church. All these are references to phases of divine love. We have in a typical way parental or paternal love in Abraham, typically God's love for Christ, which I suppose we may regard as the highest order of love. The Lord speaks Himself about it, "That the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them". Then there is in Isaac the type of Christ's love for the church. These are the two great thoughts of Genesis. Following upon that there is preferential love, that is Rebecca loved Jacob. That was preferential. And you have Jacob's love for Rachel; he loved her more than Leah. Then we have also Jacob's love for Joseph which is preferential. In all these cases the object draws out the love.
In Exodus we have love in bondslave conditions. It is a matter of the deepest interest as entering into the present time, and the service attaching to it brings us into bondslave conditions but it enhances the love "I love my master, my wife, and my children". It was active; it was not a theoretical love. Then the service that is seen there takes up another form, the priestly form, which is not in bondslave conditions, but in dignity and holiness. It is not that our Lord's love in bondslave conditions was not dignified and holy, but I am speaking now of how it is presented.
{28}
The difference lies in the description of Aaron and his sons as over against the bondman in chapter 21. So that as we understand the bondslave conditions and the love in spite of them, we shall understand something of the priestly and dignified side.
Ques. Have you in mind that the Lord has a responsive, holy love in service as a result of His own love in this way?
J.T. Yes, that is what I thought. The reference first is in the bondslave conditions, and having in mind the order in @Romans 6 we see how love worked out in bondslave conditions. Romans brings out love in the bondslave form in us. We are said to be bondmen to God. Then it also works out in the higher order, so to speak, of service, that is that he might serve in newness of spirit, not in the oldness of the letter. "I beseech you therefore, brethren ... to present your bodies a living sacrifice, ... which is your intelligent service". Sonship comes in in chapter 8. Priesthood is based on sonship.
Ques. In what aspects do we understand preferential love?
J.T. Well, it is seen in Rebecca first. Many of us are too promiscuous, I believe. We are to learn to appreciate what is lovable according to God, not what is lovable after the flesh. Isaac loved Esau. So that we have to test our appreciation. Why do I love a person? Rebecca loved Jacob, and the sequel shows that she was in the mind of God in loving him, because God hated Esau. It is a very solemn thought if I am found loving those whom God hates. They are corrupt in that way.
Ques. Would what she says, "On me be thy curse, my son", show the extent to which her love would go for Jacob?
J.T. Exactly. It was a love which would accept the curse for its object.
{29}
Ques. Do we not have a very high character of preferential love in the gospel of John as to the disciple whom Jesus loved?
J.T. Yes. He was lovable. There is a distinction between brotherly love and love. "Have ... in brotherly love love". Of course we may find ourselves preferring one whom God does not love. The Father's love for the Son is seen typically in Abraham. It is the first great feature that we get. "Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, Isaac". And then the next great thought is Christ's love for the church, which is seen typically in Isaac. These are two great primary thoughts. Preferential love arises on account of sin working in Esau, and especially in Esau because it does not say that Rebecca loved Jacob more than Esau; it does not say that she loved Esau at all. She was entirely in line with God in discernment. And then as regards Leah and Rachel, it does not intimate that Jacob did not love Leah, but he loved Rachel more. Israel is first loved; it is an appeal to Israel. He loved her first and he loved her best. Although she is rejected today, it is not His thought. Even Paul, the emissary to the gentiles, showed his preference to the Jews in going to Jerusalem. That would be a love of counsel more. Then there was the love of Jacob for Joseph. It is not that he did not love the others, but he loved him more.
Ques. Does that correspond with what the Lord said, "If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him"?
J.T. Quite. He comes especially under the Father's eye. "The Father himself has affection for you, because ye have had affection for me".
"Joseph, being seventeen years old", and then it says, "Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons because he was son of his old age", which has its own meaning. All these conditions of love are of very great importance for us.
{30}
Now when you come to Exodus, we are on the line of service. The service is urgent and the difficulty is great, but these things enter into the bondslave service, service worked out in difficult conditions, but worked out nevertheless.
Ques. Are you moving now from Genesis, the complacency of love, to the setting where the sufferings of love are found in Exodus?
J.T. Yes, we are brought down in Exodus to the sufferings of love in service. Things are urgent; the bondman is there. He may go out free, but he has to serve so many years.
Ques. Why do you speak of preferential love?
J.T. So that we may then cultivate a taste according to God, because we are too promiscuous, too undiscerning.
Ques. Would you say that the salutations, the different way in which Paul refers to saints, suggest spiritual tastes and values?
J.T. Yes, I thought so. The salutations and commendations in the epistles are varied. We are to learn to recognise the worth, integral worth, and love what is lovable and not to love that which is not lovable, that which is merely natural, but we are to be found in the mind of God. Very often we get into church difficulties because of preference in the wrong direction, and are not discerning in love. We love all in a certain way, but we must not overlook preferential love; God does not.
Ques. Do the two scriptures in Genesis suggest to us descending love and the scripture in Exodus ascending love, so that it is responsive?
J.T. You have in Genesis descending love in Abraham, and horizontal love in Isaac. The love of a husband for his wife is not descending; it is horizontal. "I love my master"; that is ascending love; 'I love my wife'; that is horizontal; 'I love my children'; that is descending love. Ascending
{31}
love must be the great thing in service. Christ's love for the saints is hardly developed in Exodus; it is the priesthood. Horizontal love contemplates people of equal rank, and I think the wife relationship is on that line, equality. So that the servant is sworn not to secure a wife for Isaac of the daughters of the Canaanites.
Ques. Is that brought out in the type of Adam and Eve? Eve was presented to Adam, "bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh", bringing out the greatness of the church?
J.T. Yes, she was to "be called Woman, because this was taken out of a man", and it is in that connection that union lies. There could be no family link between Adam and Eve because there had been no parents, but with Isaac and Rebecca there was the family link. The family link comes out in Abraham, so that we are sons. Sonship underlies Rebecca, the type of the church. So that in chapter 22 of Genesis Isaac does not come down from the mount after he is offered up. Abraham came to his young men, and came to Beer-sheba.
When we come into Exodus, while we have the descending, horizontal and ascending love in Christ, what is developed is the ascending love, but developed in priesthood. It is love in priesthood, this love in sonship, whether in Christ or in us. So that John works out the great thought of how the Son loves the Father. "That the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do", @John 14: 31. Now you come to the ascending side, and that is what we may see in @Exodus 28 and 29.
Ques. Would you just say a word as to what you have referred to in Isaac not coming down from the mountain?
J.T. It means that Christ has risen on high for us, that Christ is in heaven.
{32}
Rem. I was wondering what was the force of @Genesis 22: 19: "Abraham returned to his young men". It does not imply that Isaac was there.
J.T. Scripture is intended to produce impressions.
No doubt he came down, but it does not say so. So that Christ not having come back to earth again, not having come down to the open testimony afterwards, the church is brought to Him as in heaven. "I ascend to my Father". The omissions of Scripture are quite as important for us as the statements. How much could be written! and that which is written is intended to produce impressions in our minds. So Isaac did not come down; the work of the Spirit is to take us out of this world, detaching us from all our natural settings and giving us to understand that we are companions for Christ. Abraham in verse 5 says to his young men, "Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you". The omission referred to is therefore all the more significant.
It is interesting to note the garments that are mentioned here in Exodus. In @John 13 the Lord laid aside His garments. These garments would hardly fit a bondman, and yet they are on the bondman; it is the same Person. We must understand bondman conditions, because not only was he in them, but his wife was in them and his children were in them. We have to understand how to serve in these conditions. Bondman conditions are limited, and we are under pressure, but love is there.
Ques. Would you say that we have bondman conditions during the week, and priestly conditions on the Lord's day?
J.T. Well, it is the state of bondmanship in your spirit, the acceptance of bondmanship Godward in your spirit, and we shall not arrive at priestly conditions otherwise. The paternal thought comes in after chapter 24, where you have the priesthood alluded to
{33}
under the guise of the young men. They are used in chapter 24. I think that is just a form of advance on the bondman. Moses sent his young men and they offered sacrifices. I think we have to learn as to the bondman in chapters 21, 22 and 23, and then the advance, inasmuch as the people are ready to enter into a covenant with God and are certainly elevated. The people entered into a covenant with God. Here you have the covenant on God's side, but it is entered into on the people's side. He is pleased to bring in the covenant and makes it effective through death on His side. If we understand that we shall see that we are elevated, not theoretically, but in our souls. They are brought into liberty, and that lays the basis for the material of the sanctuary. I am to serve Him with the knowledge of His love in my heart. I am elevated, morally, actually. Then there is the necessity for someone to minister at the altar. It is not now a bondman, it is not now a question of youths, but great personages outlined in Aaron and his sons.
Ques. What would the youths suggest as in contrast to what you have been speaking of as great personages?
J.T. There is no great distinction; all that is said of them is that they are youths, or young men, a step in advance of the bondman.
Ques. Are these sons consciously and morally bondmen?
J.T. I think so: I think that is the way it works out. But in the types you approach the sanctuary. There are steps; there is the bondman, and there is the youth. "Aaron thy brother", that is the mediator. The mediator represents God. Now it is, "Aaron thy brother, ... that he may minister unto me in the priest's office".
Ques. Do we find bondman conditions in @John 15 where we experience the hatred of the world?
J.T. The bondman relation has to do with God.
{34}
It is a question of my relation with God, not that I may come into a state of slavery but that I may come under the control of God. It is not a slave state of soul; it is a question of being bound to God, having no will of my own. Service should take on bondman character. I am absolutely for another. So that the Lord Jesus being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but emptied Himself, taking a bondman's form. It is the setting up of a position where I am absolutely at the will of another. The Lord has laid the way for this; He was here for the will of God and for no other. When that is worked out it never ceases, but other features come in, namely, the youth side. I am under the direction of Moses, but I am used as a youth, as one who has living energy, and by the Spirit I am able to do these things in an active, energetic, living way. And then I am robed for this dignity in relation to Aaron, in relation to Christ as the High Priest in heaven. It is a question of taking hold of the steps which lead up to this service to God. It is dignity based on sonship. This priestly service is available for all. It says, "Thou shalt take thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him, from among the children of Israel". It would suggest that we are all open for this service. The bondman idea is that the Lord Jesus has gone even unto death. The position is retained; we never lose it. It is not derogatory; we are absolutely for the will of God, having no wills of our own. But then I go on to the setting of a young man, that is energy and freshness in the things of God, and finally I come into the dignity of priesthood, love and bondmanship. There is nothing derogatory to be here for the will of God, having no other will. It is all for God.
The workmanship of these garments referred to is most interesting. It says, "And thou shalt speak unto all that are wise hearted, whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make Aaron's garments
{35}
to consecrate him, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office. And these are the garments which they shall make; a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a mitre, and a girdle; and they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, and his sons, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office. And they shall take gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen". These colours denote the various glories of Christ. In @Hebrews 2 it says, "We see not yet all things put under him. But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour". We see Him there.
Ques. Would the first feature of the bondman be that of subjection, and the next feature that of the youth, suggesting freshness and energy? Would both blend in the third feature in giving character to the service Godward?
J.T. Yes, I thought so.
Ques. Would the Lord's movements suggest to us that the bondman's place is the proper place for man? Adam was not made a bondman, but we see the moral necessity, sin having come in, for man's taking that place.
J.T. I do not think you will ever arrive at the priesthood before going through the bondman's way -- that you are absolutely for God's will. "Not my will, but thine, be done".
The youths coming under Moses direction indicates a service without a name attached to it. But Hebrews develops the great thought in sonship: the Priest is the Son. So that the two thoughts run together. 
Ques. When the Lord Jesus said typically, "I will not go free", had He in view that moment when He could say, "Behold, I and the children which God has given me", and then what is said in @Psalm 22 showing that the wife and the children are carried over? He has secured them as a bondman.
{36}
J.T. They are carried over, so that He sings in the midst of the assembly. But the great point of our reading is how love works, how it works in the bondman conditions, and how it develops as in the youth and then in the priesthood where we serve God in all the dignity of sons, as these garments represent. The high priest has got them all; he has got them on his shoulder; he has got them on his heart, and then the sons are brought in with their high caps and their dress. Then there are the linen breeches or trousers, meaning that if we are to be brought into this service we are to be brought into it soberly. The linen means sobriety, that we are kept under His control.
Ques. Are you suggesting that the great motive which should move us in all these conditions is love?
J.T. Yes; that is what I have in mind. What a great thing it is, and how it works out in bondman conditions, and is then developed in these beautiful conditions of youth and priesthood. I think chapter 28 would help us out of clericalism and sectarianism; if we studied that we should see that the service includes all saints, but it includes them in love; they are on the breastplate. The thought of the priesthood is that it cares for what is due to the nature of God-the holiness of God. It goes right through into eternity.
Nothing is derogatory about the bondmen. We connect the bondman with righteousness and the priesthood with holiness. Service is morally glorious, all founded in sonship. In @Ephesians 3 we read, "That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God".
That is the crown of this wonderful service.
{37}
MATERIAL FOR WRITING AND FOR BUILDING
@Exodus 34: 29 - 32; @Exodus 35: 1 - 9; @2 Corinthians 3: 2, 3; @Revelation 3: 12
I wish to say a few words about material as it is presented to us in the scriptures we have read. In the beginning when things were made, material necessarily entered into the primary creation. There can be no making without material, and so we have the great creatorial thought in Genesis and the moral redemptive thought in Exodus. Exodus in that way is greater, but it is a question of building, what is said in Hebrews to be figurative representations of the things in the heavens. Alongside of that in Exodus we have writing material, which is what I want particularly to stress as having a direct application to us now. I wish to speak particularly of writing material because the writing refers to Christ. Man according to God is set out figuratively so that he may run who reads, and if God is pleased to take us up for this purpose, it is obvious that we should be wholly available, that there should be something to be read written in us. I dwell for a moment on Exodus, specially to call attention to the setting of the actual supply of material in this book. First of all we have the building material, what is required for the tabernacle. In chapter 25, as we will all remember, the special requirements for the sanctuary are given, God proposing the thought Himself that He should dwell among His people, and that they should supply the means for the dwelling. Nothing could be more appealing to those who love God. Jacob's first thoughts of Bethel were not very pleasant ones; he said it was a dreadful place, for God was there. Later he came back to it soberly;
{38}
indeed the next morning he named it soberly, indicating that he was beginning to value it. Later he could return to it and God talked with him and stood beside him. At first it was on the top of the ladder and Jacob at the bottom, but now He is standing in Bethel showing that a great change had come about.
At best, the actual house in Genesis is abstract. There is no concrete house at all. God went up, we are told, whereas in Exodus we get the concrete thought, and that appeals to love; it appeals to those who love God. Let no one be in any doubt, there are thousands of them, those of whom God speaks at the beginning, the thousands of those that love Him. That is a great thought. It underlies in a certain sense the provision of the material. Whatever I or any of us could be, let us be assured that there are thousands who love God, and to all such the thought that God is simply to be in heaven and man on earth is not good enough. God is in heaven; that is not enough for love. Love wants to be where He is lovers of God want God. They want Him near, and they want Him not in an abstract way but in a concrete way, in suitable surroundings, congenial circumstances. That is what Exodus typically supplies, and hence it is a figurative representation of things in the heavens. That is to say God's circumstances above are brought down here so that He may be here, so that He may dwell here.
Now it is love that makes the provision. The Lord Jesus says, answering Judas, not Iscariot, "If any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him", @John 14: 23. Now that is a very suitable statement; it includes Exodus, for the word is the unfolding of the mind of God in conditions suitable for God, so that He can come and abide with one.
Conditions are suitable. Now that is what we get in Exodus; I will come and dwell with you. The Lord
{39}
Jesus says to Laodicea, "I will come in unto him and will sup with him, and he with me", but the tabernacle implies more than that. As loving Him there are conditions so that the Father and the Son come and abide. Well, what I wish to point out in chapter 34 in regard to material for the building is that the actual supply is in the presence of the shining of Moses face. There was no supply immediately upon the first giving of the law. Indeed the hearts of the people had been diverted to idolatry, so that the first effected nothing; it is the new covenant that effects what is in the mind of God, and in chapter 34 we have figuratively the new covenant. I want to dwell on this because it has so much to do with the material. "But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory". The material lies there. It is a real change; it is not an external change; it is a real substantial change. That is what is meant. Mere application externally is not enough. We need substantial change of material, and so we have this shining. And as Moses came down his face shone, and so the next chapter in view of that stresses the idea of what is to be done on the sabbath. It is in Exodus we get the first mention of the sabbath by name. We get it in relation to the manna, on mount Sinai in chapter 31, and then in relation to the shining of Moses face. Now to get the benefit of the shining I have got to read, I have got to keep my sabbath. Beloved brethren, you will understand that I am not legalising laziness amongst us; there is too much of that. People portion out a little time for God and the rest of it they devote to pleasure. There is too much of that. I am not speaking of that at all; I am speaking of sabbath according to God. We are first told to keep it. We read that God rested on the seventh day; He was refreshed. It is very important that the saints should be refreshed, and if I am to be refreshed
{40}
I am to be acted upon. Refreshment is from another; I am acted upon, and so in regard to the material it is a passive type here. I am to be constituted material by being acted upon, and I am to be used as material. He was refreshed. A meeting like this is refreshing. There are other things, of course, but all are passive, and with us it is a question of being passive and receptive. There is something going on all the time. If we keep sabbath rightly something is proceeding. Our eyes are not closed; our ears are not closed; our sensibilities are all awake, they are not asleep. It is the idea of intelligent restfulness in the presence of the greatest thing, in the presence of shining, in the presence of God as in Christ shining upon us so that there is observation of what is presented to us. That is what is material for God. The sun shines on the land, the dew which God has provided in His goodness comes down and causes the land to be enriched, and so the sabbath, the keeping of the sabbath, implies that we are not to sit lazily but to sit with active hearts and minds to take in what is presented. And what is presented has to be continuous. There are these special occasions, of course, but the shining is constant.
Now I think that Moses gives us the key to all this in Exodus. He is the great feature of Exodus. Now we read that he journeyed to Midian, and arriving there he sat down by a well. What thoughts filled his heart and mind, as he sat in that distant land separated from his parents, from his family, from his nation! He delighted his heart in God. He sat by the well. It is a sort of key to the whole book, both with regard to the ministry of the truth and with regard to what is said, the ability to sit down, and to sit down where there is a means of refreshment, the well, the spring.
The activity is to be in the spring. It is for me to sit in the presence of it and absorb it. Then in the next chapter we find that Moses is on the mountain of God.
What a place to be in! He saw the bush burning and
{41}
the bush was not consumed. And he says, "I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt". You can see him there. What a vision it was! A burning bush and fire in it and yet the bush was not consumed. There is material, material which exists in the judgment of God. Fire is active.
What an impression it would make on Moses. "I will now turn aside, and see this great sight". How God would speak to us in turning aside to see.
And so here it is the shining. Most remarkable thing; so remarkable was it that "when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him. And Moses called unto them"; and they returned to him. The Lord would say, "Come near". It had already taken place with Joseph. Aaron came near and all Israel came near that the shining might have the full effect upon them. They came near, and then the injunction is as to the sabbath. Work must be done, but it had to be done on the six days, and the seventh must be kept rigidly. Not even a fire must be lighted; that is to say, that you must bask in the light, according to the blessing of Aaron, "The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: the Lord make his face shine upon thee ... and give thee peace". What a word that is, beloved; it urges upon us the necessity of being passive in the sense of which I am speaking, and let the fight come and let it shine in all its life-giving power, the life-giving power of the rays that shine upon the face of Jesus. These meetings, of course, are for refreshment. They accentuate the thought that the Lord in @John 13 laid aside His garments, and took a towel and girded Himself and washed His disciples feet. He refreshed them. They were doing nothing; they were lying at table. It is the principle of letting the Lord do things for us, so that He can impart to us His own virtue. Well, that is what He does.
{42}
Now I must pass on to the New Testament. The thought of building material is a very common thing in the New Testament. Peter is the great representative of it. He was passive. The Lord says to him, "Flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father". One would urge it upon the brethren to be passive and see what God will do, what God will bring into the soul, so that the material is there; and when it is there, we get "*Thou* art Peter". One would challenge each one of us here. It is not a question of your activity, it is a question of God's activity-letting God act upon you. "*Thou* art Peter". As one moves about amongst the brethren one is reminded of the need of this material. "*Thou* art Peter". Something that can be used and of a permanent nature. Well, it is the work of God. "Let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon". I am sure that this material is very scarce amongst the brethren today, the kind of material that is in keeping with the foundation. "Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ".
Well now, in regard to the writing-the writing material. Exodus is the first book to bring that out too. The first material was made by God Himself. He made the tables, and He made the writing, but the second tables were made by the mediator; they were made by Moses. God made the writing, but Moses made the tables. That enters into 2 Corinthians, and what comes out as a result of the instruction is that those who were served so well and so lovingly were questioning the great servant by whom they had been served. If we serve we must learn to suffer, as Paul says, "Though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved". One must learn to be hurt by those whom we serve best. And the beloved apostle could say, "Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men". A word too for those who minister. Let them take heed that they do not speak
{43}
ill of the brethren. A critical minister-one who is critical amongst the brethren-leaves a very poor impression. It gives a chilly impression to speak ill against the brethren. We have to be faithful, but that is not speaking ill about them. It is as though Paul would say, 'You are speaking ill about me, but wherever I go I bring out beautiful things about you. You yourselves are my letter'. There was much that could be said about the Corinthians. The apostle says much to them, but about them is another matter. 'I have brought out every good thing about you; ye are my letter read of all men, written in my heart'. How he corresponded with the great High Priest in heaven! Now what is written in my heart I am sure to speak about, and that is the idea of the writing; it is what I speak about, "Known and read of all men". And then he explains, "Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart". Now he comes down to ourselves as to whether we are material, whether the Holy Spirit can indite something about Christ, can write something of Christ in our hearts. Fleshy means that they are impressionable. The people who go in for polish of this world, beloved, are not such material as is spoken of here. The harder the stone, the better the polish it takes, but the writing is not polished writing. Writing is what God would have to say to us. There is nothing more practical. We send a Bible to the heathen, but the divine thought is living witnesses, living epistles of Christ, as it is said, "known and read of all men". Oh, that we may receive some reflection of Christ to take it in passively by the power of the Spirit of the living God!
Then I wanted to refer to Revelation to show how this specially works out in our time-which is the time of overcoming. These verses relate to the overcomer
{44}
in Philadelphia. Philadelphia is overcoming, but the idea is an overcomer. It is a person, the individual that overcomes. The maintenance of what is of God depends upon the overcomer, and the overcomer in this chapter has a peculiar honour conferred. He is to be a pillar in the temple of God, but he is to be written upon. Now there is writing paper and writing paper; paper for documents which are to be held for a long period of time requires to be specially made. It is a question here not only that I can be written upon, but that this particular thing must be written upon me. I am special material; I am a special kind of paper, such writing material that the Lord can write upon me the name of His God. Think of that! Think of the Lord Jesus writing the name of His God and the name of the city of His God! Then He tells us what that is: "New Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God". That is to say, 'I am using you virtually for the greatest position, to be written upon, for the things relate to Myself, My own matter, the name of My God'. Think of what God was to Jesus and that I am capable of receiving an impression of that in my soul. As He says when praying to His Father, "That the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them", that the highest form of love may be in my heart and in your heart. "The name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem"-the overcomer of this church understands this thing. He understands the name of Jesus God. He understands the name of the city of God. Then He says, "my new name". Think of being material for that! It is most practical. I think the Lord would appeal to us to take a passive attitude, beloved brethren, so that conditions may come about that I absorb what is needed to be able to take on such impressions as these, and there should be something seen in me, something read in me, the name of Jesus God, and
{45}
the name of the city of God and His new name. How great the thought is! So I leave it, that we might learn something of this blessedness of being in the presence of the great thoughts of God, actively presented to us in the power of the Spirit.
{46}
GOD MOVING WITH HIS PEOPLE
@Philippians 3: 12 - 16; @Numbers 9: 1 - 14; @Numbers 10: 33 - 36
J.T. What is in my mind as to the principles set out in @Numbers 10 is that as we move, our way being clear, God moves with us. It says, "And they set forward from the mountain of Jehovah and went three days journey; and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went before them in the three days journey, to search out a resting-place for them". That is, the undertaking is definite, a three days journey, and the ark joined in to lead in the three days journey. I thought we might be helped in linking on Philippians, which is an epistle involving this thought of movement. The apostle himself leads the way, using strong terms, the word 'pursue' having a definite end in view. As he says, "I pursue, looking towards the goal, for the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus". And then he says, "As many therefore as are perfect, let us be thus minded; and if ye are any otherwise minded, this also God shall reveal to you. But whereto we have attained, let us walk in the same steps". There is the thought of movement. Paul uses strong terms as to himself, but he thinks of the saints moving together and urges the same steps. According to what point we have reached we may move together. So with all this in view it is the thought that the passover in its setting here in Numbers might be considered as entering into this matter of unity, of walking in the same steps.
It will be observed perhaps by some of us that the date given in chapter 9 is earlier than the date given in chapter 1; that is, the book begins at a later date than is mentioned in chapter 9. In the first chapter it says, "And Jehovah spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai in the tent of meeting, on the first of the second
{47}
month, in the second year after their departure from the land of Egypt". So that this particular instruction is reserved by the writer of the book to insert in the section that speaks of movement. That is what I was thinking that we might look into.
P.E.H.W. Does the recognition of the truth of the passover mark the first movements in soul history?
J.T. Yes. It is the beginning of months and is calculated to set us together in self-judgment. For there is no other ground of being together save in self-judgment. The passover deals with that side.
F.W. The passover, in the three places in which it is brought forward, has always movement in view. It seems to set the people together.
J.T. Yes. That is what is stated in Exodus. It says in @Exodus 12: 37, after the instructions for the passover are given, "And the children of Israel journeyed". The same principle comes out that we alluded to in @Exodus 13: 20, "And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, at the end of the wilderness. And Jehovah went before their face by day in a pillar of cloud". That is the principle; they are moving; the way was plain. They had to move out of Egypt but Jehovah joined in as they moved. But it was as keeping the passover that they moved.
H.W.R.S. With regard to self-judgment, would the fact that unleavened bread and bitter herbs are mentioned in the case of one that was unclean emphasise that?
J.T. Quite so. Where there is a defect in the person there is nothing to be left out, nothing in the ordinances governing the passover to be omitted. It says, "With unleavened bread and bitter herbs shall they eat it". It is more important in the case of a person or persons who are defective and have to delay a month in the taking of it that they should preserve
{48}
every part of it, because you may be sure that they needed it more than the persons who took it the first month.
C.R.W. Would you apply that at the present moment?
J.T. That is what it is written for. These types are all for us. It is very interesting that this particular instruction is inserted in chapter 9 as the time of movement had arrived, so that united movement should be according to God. We should not appear to be moving and not be united. The passover is to settle these matters that hinder unity.
F.W. Does it suggest the settlement of moral questions?
J.T. That is the intent, so that nobody is to be debarred. These men had been defiled and Moses carefully asks Jehovah about it, and He says, "If any one of you or of your generations be unclean by reason of a dead body or be on a journey afar off, yet he shall hold the passover to Jehovah".
Ques. They had to put away all leaven before they could keep the passover. How do you apply that?
J.T. It is very simple. The interpretation is given in the New Testament. We are to keep the feast with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. God saw to it that they did not have any leaven because He did not give them time to put it in when they were leaving Egypt. He forced them out. It is sincerity and truth that is needed, that is really the point. So that if there be any cause at all which might debar one from the ordinance, that is the solution of it: go back to sincerity and truth. Why should one be among the dead? He was defiled by a dead body. Why should a christian be among the dead?
C.R.W. What would correspond to that today?
J.T. It is affiliating with the dead. Our relations are among the living.
{49}
E.J.McB. That would indicate that movement had ceased altogether. There is no movement with a dead person.
C.R.W. This was something that debarred them from the passover altogether.
J.T. They thought it did, but it did not according to the word of Jehovah. He said they should keep it.
C.R.W. They could not keep it while they were defiled. They had to be cleansed first, did they not?
J.T. The cleansing is in the keeping of it. If you go back to the beginning, that is the death of Christ. Let us keep it, but keep it with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
Rem. There was provision made for one that was defiled for a near relative, a father or a mother.
J.T. We are not to be defiled at all. If any one claims licence to be defiled we have to look into his case. The matter is solved here. They are to keep the passover; Jehovah says they are to keep it.
C.R.W. Would that be on a line with what the apostle says, "Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat"?
J.T. That is it. Keeping the feast with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. "Christ our passover is sacrificed for us" is the great objective side of the feast. My part of it is the unleavened bread. That is what the believer has to bring. There is no movement according to God in walking together aside from this sincerity and truth.
H.W.R.S. The person may be defiled, there is provision for that, but there is no allowance of that condition of things remaining. Anyone forbearing to keep the passover was to be cut off.
J.T. Other scriptures provide for one defiled by the dead, but then it took time, according to @Numbers 19, to bring about the cleansing. That is not inserted here. The point here is that the feast must be kept. If you cannot keep it the first month, keep
{50}
it the second month. It is imperative that the feast is to be kept.
-.V. There was something in the desire of these people to keep the passover. They considered for Jehovah.
J.T. God took account of that. They say, "Why are we kept back, that we may not present the offering of Jehovah?". They get an extension of a month, but the feast must be held, otherwise there is a penalty.
F.W. Is not the whole question of fellowship involved here? If he does not do it he is to be cut off from the people.
J.T. The unity is essential in view of our moving together, and that is the great idea in the wilderness, moving together. This instruction is inserted here just as they are about to move, so that the movement should be of a united character, because the passover was intended to put the people together familywise. It was a uniting thing, but uniting in self-judgment, uniting in the disallowance of sin. Any other kind of unity is abhorrent to God.
W.J.T. Would it be connected with the longsuffering that Peter speaks of-"not willing that any should perish"?
J.T. It is on that principle, God extending the time in mercy.
P.L. Would Peter himself be an illustration of it? He had kept company with the dead and denied his Lord, and so he waited another month and the Lord waited upon him in the passover character of His suffering love in @John 21. So that Peter follows later; there is movement and he has to learn to follow John and others.
J.T. That is so. The Lord looked on him immediately after the sin but that was not the completion of the matter. The Lord had in mind that Peter should be in the front rank. He was not to be behind; the Lord was very concerned that he should not have to
{51}
be behind. He looks on him; that is the first thing. At the exact time that the cock crew the Lord turned and looked on him. It was, as it were, on the calendar that this thing should happen and as it happened His power was there, exactly at the time. Then Peter went out and wept bitterly. That is the first movement on Peter's side. There was no time lost, because as soon as the cock had crowed the Lord turned and looked on Peter, and he went out and wept bitterly. Then as He arose from the dead it says He appeared unto Simon. That is the principle, I think, that the Lord is urgent that we should be in the ranks, that we should move on. Peter was not behind when the time of movement came, because the real time of movement was Pentecost. He was not behind then; he had kept the passover. He was in accord with the death of Christ. The Lord saw to that.
Ques. You said that this was on the calendar. Would the keeping of the passover save us from things that otherwise would be on the calendar?
J.T. Just so. The thought of the divine calendar is very helpful in this subject, because it is mentioned specifically in @Exodus 12. It was four hundred and thirty years to the day that Israel should go out of Egypt. The movement was exactly according to time.
Ques. I do not know whether I exactly got your thought as to the calendar in regard to Peter.
J.T. The Lord had said that this would happen. Anything that is definitely stated to happen is on the calendar in time, because things are kept most accurately. It was as the cock crew. The cock crowing is like the clock, the hour of the day or night, and as that happened the Lord turned and looked on Peter. So in Exodus as the children of Israel are moving out it is four hundred and thirty years to the day, which is indicated in @Genesis 15. Everything is moved by the divine calendar, and therefore every one of us is in the divine mind. We want to be in the movement,
{52}
because movement is in time, so that you do not want to be behind, you do not want to be out of rank. Peter was not behind; the Lord saw to that, He brought him up to time.
E.J.McB. You mean that in divine things nothing happens before its time and nothing happens after?
J.T. That is right.
E.J.McB. I think this principle would greatly help our local care meetings because we should have no matters to deal with if we judged ourselves when matters turned up. If we took up the question of unleavened bread in ourselves we should always be in rank with our brethren.
J.T. That is right. Here is Paul; look at him.
He is pursuing. I must keep my eye on the ark or on the cloud moving and I must keep up with it. When it comes to the tribes there was Judah and his company, Ephraim and his company, Dan and his company, all to march together. When the march begins I must be right. That is what the passover is for, that I should be right. If I am not right, then the Lord is very gracious, He gives me a month.
F. W. How beautifully that is seen in the Lord in @Luke 22. The hour was come. He did not miss the appointment on the calendar.
J.T. They were all there; the twelve were there. And so at Pentecost they were all together in one place. It is the missing ones, that is to say missing spiritually, that are not keeping the passover.
P.L. So that Thomas would get his month allowed him and he is found when the Lord appears eight days later.
J.T. I think that is good. But he missed the main thing. I do not think the Lord took the same pains with him as He did with Peter. The Lord made great efforts with Peter. Peter had a place that Thomas did not have and the Lord would have that place filled.
{53}
Ques. Have the early verses of @Philippians 3 any connection with the passover? Were those features which Paul speaks of as marking him things which we have to judge in the passover?
J.T. You mean circumcision and the legal side of things. All these things would be just the working of the flesh. The Lord would bring us up to time, because the march is according to His order, the movement is according to His thought and even if we are slow in it, "Whereto we have attained", the apostle says, "let us walk in the same steps". Let the ranks be kept.
Ques. Do you get the thought of the ranks in the children of Israel going out of Egypt?
J.T. They did not go out as a mob. It is stated that they went out in rank. I think it is just to credit the spiritual condition that was there. There was faith there. That is the one thing that is said of them; they crossed the sea by faith.
In @Exodus 12, 13 and 14 there are remarkable spiritual touches. Whilst you have the most precise directions, yet you find things that are not exactly by direction. When Moses tells the people about the passover he puts it all in his own language. If you look at chapter 12, the instructions are from verse 1 to verse 20, whereas Moses speech to the people is between verse 21 and verse 27. It is put in his own way. It is the true ministerial thought. He knows how to present the thing to the people, to present the mind of God in an abridged way. Then too in regard of the ranks, five in a rank. It was not stated that they were to go that way but they did go that way. It was to bring out the spiritual formation that was there at that time. If a young believer is going out of the world, if he is of any value at all, there is something spiritual there. They did not go out as a mob. You look at all the saints; as soon as you are converted you think of the nearest christian. That is what is meant. That
{54}
is the commencement of better things. God loves that.
E.J.McB. You have your place; you are in rank.
J.T. You will always find that is the mark of a true convert. He has got some spiritual instinct and he sees that he should be linked with the christians near him.
M.D.H.W. Would the four gospels help us to be maintained in the good of the position? There were four days in which the lamb was in the house after it was taken out from the sheep or goats; it was a perfect one.
J.T. You mean that the Lord Jesus is seen in the gospels under the eyes of men, and then He is taken and slain? That is very touching.
Ques. Do you think that the two going to Emmaus were recovered in view of the momentous events that were to take place in Jerusalem? The Lord rebukes them for being slow of heart and speaks of the Christ having to suffer, and He breaks the bread before them. That touches their hearts so that they instinctively go and find the eleven.
J.T. You are stressing the "slow of heart"? They were not in the ranks. If we are slow of heart that is slothfulness. So He moves them by the breaking of bread and they return at once to Jerusalem. As soon as the movement begins they are there, they are alive. I believe the passover has a great place in our local settings as to moving together. The breaking of bread is the external expression of our unity, the Lord's supper, "we being many are one bread", but the passover is the secret state of things amongst us. Unless the passover is kept, public unity is not of much value.
Ques. Is that the reason why it comes in @1 Corinthians 5? Paul reminded them of the calendar at the outset.
J.T. It is in view of the Lord's supper. Chapter S is dealing with evil and chapter 11 presents the Lord's
{55}
supper. Secret unity is brought about by the passover.
Rem. So that in @Philippians 4 the movement was held up; it was hindered by two sisters not being of the same mind.
J.T. Just so. That is the great feature of the epistle, to bring that about. Great as the assembly was at Philippi there was a measure of division amongst them, not as bad as it was at Corinth, but they needed to be of one mind and to think the same thing, not only to speak but to think the same thing. I believe the passover brings that about. It deals radically with the state we are in. It is a sorrowful thing to be assuming to be united when there is no real unity. It is the state of our souls that is the real difficulty; we are not sincere in relation to one another.
Rem. The Lord's prayer in @John 17 would bring in unity: "That they all may be one". The passover embraces all the saints of God.
J.T. It does. It comes in as you go out of Egypt and it comes in as you enter the land. It must be present at every phase of our position.
I thought that, having dwelt on the passover, we might see how beautifully, as we move together, the love of Christ comes into evidence. There is a definite movement from the mount of Jehovah for three days. It is a definite period of time. It is not a question of the distance. Distance geographically is taken account of in verse 11, "The cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony. And the children of Israel set forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud stood still in the wilderness of Paran". That is the public position, but now it is the private thing. The spiritual side of it is this three days journey from the mount of Jehovah, and as they took that three days journey the ark took the same journey. That is the love of Christ; we cannot afford to be without that. We may have the first great movement to Paran, that is the cloud,
{56}
but the movement of the ark is what we want to get hold of; what it did outside of any previous announcement. You never can tell what love may do for you. Love looks for definiteness, and it moves definitely too. They moved a three days journey; it is a purely spiritual matter.
C.R.W. Would the three days be connected with the Lord's journey through death and resurrection?
J.T. That is the thought. It is that kind of journey you are set for.
E.J.McB. The Lord refers to it, does He not, when He says, "I must needs walk today and tomorrow and the day following", @Luke 13: 33. He would lead us into the realm of spiritual blessing in resurrection, and He would give us credit for moving in the same direction ourselves.
J.T. It took them more than three days to go to the wilderness of Paran; that is a public thing, like Corinthians, which is the public side. Ephesians is the spiritual side. The ark goes before you there and you get rest on that line.
E.J.McB. There is no knowing what you may be led into on that line.
J.T. If love goes before us we get somewhere. We are not to awake love till it pleases, but if you let it go before it will take you somewhere. We cannot afford to be without the resting place that love gives.
Ques. It says in the Song of Songs, "Come with me ...", @Song of Songs 4: 8. Would you connect that with this?
J.T. Just so. What is so beautiful about it is that there is nothing said about this movement before. In these typical books, where you get nothing said about things before, the incidents allude to spirituality. Without spirituality the externals must be dead. We may have meetings at set times but if there is no three days journey there is no spiritual power.
{57}
E.J.McB. Do you mean that there are certain instructions *which* we are bound to abide by, but then there are spiritual things that are opened out to those that follow them?
J.T. Yes. The instructions are like the banks of the river, but if love moves it is never to be restricted.
It is to be allowed to have its full scope. It falls in with me. I am going a three days journey; that is my mind. It is death and resurrection really and I am going that way, but the ark goes before me and it leads me somewhere that I had not thought of.
E.J.McB. "Taken possession of by Christ Jesus",
@Philippians 3: 12. The power of the love of Christ really held the apostle's mind.
J.T. That is very fine.
Ques. Is it important to see that they set forward from the mount of Jehovah?
J.T. Yes. That is the place of resources. If you are going to take three days journey you must have resources. You must be furnished. That is the thing to look for with the assembly, this great movement that is not spoken of before.
-.V. In Jeremiah God speaks of Israel going after Him in the wilderness (@Jeremiah 2: 2). That is a spiritual movement, is it not?
J.T. That would be more the general thought of the cloud; as it moved they moved. But here they are moving after the ark; that is something to get up to. The ark makes a way. As you move, it joins in and finds a resting place. We need a point of rest for our souls. The Lord says, "Ye shall find rest to your souls", @Matthew 11: 29.
Rem. Moses would have had the son of Reuel, his father-in-law, to lead them, but it is the ark that leads.
J.T. Yes. Moses had thought that Hobab would be eyes for them. I have no doubt that the ark here is the answer to that.
{58}
Rem. You were speaking just now about moving together. If everyone had the mind that was in Christ Jesus, that would produce unity, it would move us together.
J.T. Yes. That is the idea in Philippians, the mind that was in Christ Jesus; not merely our profession, but our thinking the same thing.
E.J.McB. Does not feeding on the passover form the inward state?
J.T. There is the thought of a whole in it "Neither shall ye break a bone thereof". The saints are to do one thing, to eat one thing, roast with fire.
Rem. The instruction that not a bone shall be broken occurs in the second passover.
J.T. Yes, it is remarkable that it comes in in the second passover. It is mentioned in @Exodus 12, but it comes in in the second month. That means that the unity is to be kept. It is a whole idea, not a broken thought. It alludes to the church, but it is all inward; it is what you eat.
P.L. Can you have the ear of God about enemies unless you are moving with the ark? Difficulties prowl round us, but can we expect deliverance for anything less than what is here set out, moving in affinity with the ark, in relation to the desires of Christ for the assembly?
J.T. I think that raises a very important question how the deliverance comes. When the ark set forward Moses said, "Rise up, Jehovah, and let thine enemies be scattered". The ground is cleared; the ark sets forward and Jehovah rises up and our enemies are scattered. Then when it rests, "Return, Jehovah, unto the myriads of the thousands of Israel". It is a poor thing to expect God to be amongst us when we are not united. It is not respectful to God to expect Him to come in. Not that He does not come in, for He is more gracious than any of us, but if we invite
{59}
Him it is to the place of unity, to a united state of things.
C.H. Does that flow out from a movement on the part of the people towards the thoughts of God? The three days journey was a movement towards the thoughts of God.
J.T. The spiritual side in all these types is interwoven with spiritual things of which you get no account before. You cannot get any previous account of what is spiritual. It is beyond us but it shows itself and we should be looking for its manifestation. A three days journey occurs in @Exodus 15; that is a spiritual thought. As you are spiritual there is an increase of spirituality in the movements of the assembly.
C.H. They are not warring here, they are journeying.
J.T. They are journeying definitely and in spiritual conditions. Journeying to Paran is a question of territory, but this is a spiritual matter. It is not a question of territory; it is inward, more like Ephesians.
C.H. It does not exactly give a destination but it speaks of a rest, so that when we come to spiritual things, are we not always given the impression that there is something beyond?
J.T. This movement leads into eternity. It is love's movement; you will never get the compass of that. It is Ephesians really.
P.E.H.W. Would the unleavened bread be entirely negative and this be taking possession of the thoughts of love?
J.T. Quite so. The ark has its place so that we are now moving spiritually.
Ques. Are these two movements seen in the close of John? The Lord presents Himself in the midst.
J.T. @John 20 is the second word of Moses here.
{60}
@John 18 is the first word, when He says, "I am". That is the secret of the ark. The ark is always a mysterious thing, but if it moves you are being led on spiritually.
Ques. Is it important to see that in the epistle to the Philippians two sisters are spoken of and exhorted that they should be of one mind in the Lord? I was wondering if the sisters would help as being of one mind in the Lord.
J.T. Just so. It is remarkable how they are brought in. There is generally a tendency amongst us to leave everything to the brothers. You will find if you ask how many are in fellowship you will be told how many brothers are in fellowship. That is not the way to put it. Not that the brothers are not distinctive, because the Spirit of God makes them distinctive, but we must remember that the sisters count, and they certainly count in spirituality.
Rem. I thought it would imply that these two sisters were not getting on together and the apostle would adjust that.
J.T. It does imply that. It is very often that a difference amongst the brothers arises from the sisters. It is sure to show itself in the brothers.
Rem. We get true fellowship in @judges 1: 3, where Judah says to Simeon, "Come up with me into my lot, and let us fight against the Canaanites, and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot".
J.T. That is the idea, it is the mutual feeling.
W.A.T. I suppose as being under the sense of this latter part of the chapter we should be more in order in regard to the other part. It would greatly help us in our meetings to come to the spiritual side.
J.T. Yes. It is "Rise up, Jehovah", it is the spiritual thing. What are our meetings if God is not with us? Is God among you? That is the great
{61}
thing. The outward order is nothing unless God is with us. "Let thine enemies be scattered"; not mine, but Thine. It is a question of God and His assembly. And then, "Return, Jehovah, unto the myriads of the thousands of Israel". So that God has a place of rest among us.
{62}
NAMES IN THE HOUSE OF GOD
@John 17: 26; @Genesis 35: 6 - 15; @2 Kings 2: 4
I wish to speak about the idea of a name as it is seen in the Scriptures, and of how, as regards God and as regards ourselves as believers, it enters into God's house. The idea of a name is, as it were, stamped on the house. I hope to show how it applies to every believer from the divine standpoint. The name of each is called as he is baptised; he is baptised "to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit". The great thought of name is before him as seen in a divine Person in revelation. His own name is mentioned, but only in a potential way, for before baptism there can be little worth naming in the believer. What is in the divine mind, which is to be developed always, corresponds with the great thought of the name as presented-"the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit". The thought of the name connects powerfully: the nations are to be baptised unto it. The nations have each their men worthy of distinction and renown, and their names have a great place in the nation as unregenerate, but baptism implies that they are now regarded in their true light; that is of no value morally. The believer would never seek a place nationally. The idea in baptism is another world. God always had the idea of a world in His mind, it has taken form already in Christ, involving renown, and a name according to God. So all our thoughts as to name are henceforth, as baptised, to be in that relation. God's world takes form now in the house of God, which is a provisional thought, and belongs to circumstances relating to us; it affords present enjoyment of what we go on to finally. All the features of that world are to be known now in the house. I may say here, that
{63}
baptism does not of itself introduce into the house, but it introduces into the realm in which that name is prominent, the divine name, for there is only one name, that of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit; it does not say names (see @Matthew 28: 19). Baptism introduces into that, and it sets the believer up in that relation; he finds what the name means for his own soul. The Lord says, "I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known", it is one thing to be baptised unto the name, and another that it should be made known by the One who alone can make it known, that is the Son. "I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known"; that is, there should be absolute certainty that it is made known in us; and then He adds, "That the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them", @John 17: 26.
The believer is thus brought into that which is the highest order of love, namely, the love the Father has for the Son; *that* kind of love is to be in them, "the love with which thou hast loved me", and correspondingly He adds and "I in them". The Lord is in us, in our affections as thus known, in such an exalted love as that, that which the Father has for the Son. We are able to love the Son in some measure as the Father loves Him: it is that kind of love. Therefore, dear brethren, that is the way the name comes out, it stands in relation to love; everything must work back to that, to what God is. Each of us acquires a name of distinction in that way, and what a variety there would be, each having his own distinction; I want you to take that in to begin with. Christianity began with the assertion that there were a certain number in the upper room in Jerusalem, "The crowd of names who were together", not a number of believers, or saints, or brethren, but of *names*. Everyone had a distinction, and that is what is meant in the salutations in the epistles, as bringing out the distinctions in the
{64}
brethren in each locality, that distinction being the outcome of love shown in some particular way. If I do not love I am nothing; if I do love, it is noted in heaven.
I want to show you how all that worked out in Genesis, so that we may see how we come into the realm of love, which is the house, where these great thoughts have their fulness. You will remember how the thought of name arose with Cain. We have the thought of the giving of names from the very beginning of creation: "the darkness he called Night" and so forth, but when we come to man, He "called their name Adam", @Genesis 5: a. That is said of the man and the woman: He "called their name Adam". But as yet there are not exploits or distinctions acquired through exploits; Cain begins that; he built a city and the idea of name comes into evidence, for he called it after the name of his son. There you get the germ of the word, in the idea of a man calling a city after the name of his son, and that thought runs on to Babel, where men said, "Let us make ourselves a name". Over that God writes *confusion* "Therefore was its name called Babel"-confusion. Men give titles but there is nothing moral, nothing that deserves the recognition of heaven in them. Christians aspiring to them just add to the confusion. If a christian aspires to something to which a man who has no regard for God aspires, see the company he is in! Confusion is written over it, whether it applies to a christian or an unregenerate man.
So you get the idea first with Cain, then with the progeny of angels and the daughters of men; these were the men of renown, the heroes of ancient times. Men have searched into these things, and have spent their lives to establish facts in regard to these matters, but the further to the root of them we get, the more objectionable they are found to be, the less fit to be named in the mouths of holy men and women. "These
{65}
were the heroes, who of old were men of renown", men whose names were revered and even worshipped down the ages, but whose origin is enough to show anybody how unfit they are to be regarded by those who love Christ.
Then we find the thought carried through to Babel, the idea showing that collectively what is seen in every nation in the way of patriotism and nationalism has to be discounted, along with the other names of which I have spoken; baptism requires it. "Let us build ourselves a city and a tower, the top of which may reach to the heavens; and let us make ourselves a name". There was no thought of going through into heaven, it was simply for conspicuousness; and God has written Babel, confusion, over it. That is enough for the christian. He comes to see negatively that divine distinction is not confusion. You leave all that which is marked by Babel behind, and enter upon that which is marked by divine order. Although the word 'crowd' is used by the Spirit in @Acts 1, in connection with names, it is no discredit to the hundred and twenty; heaven has put honour on every one of them, that is how it will be in eternity; each will be marked off by the evidence of love, and the work of God in them. However great the number, and it will be great, there will be no confusion. Everyone will be like Christ, but everyone will have his own distinction and be recognisable, so there will be no confusion there.
Commencing with the name given to the city we have the use of names according to God on moral grounds; there are names given creationally, and there are names that come out in a moral sense. Seth calls his son's name Enosh, that is no distinction, he is just a frail, mortal man; there is no distinction. What intelligence that implies! That is where baptism fits in; he would claim no distinction. Graveyards show that death is very callous and makes nothing of men.
{66}
Enosh is a landmark, dear brethren, and each of us has to understand what it means: mortal man, dying man. There is no distinction. And the scripture adds, "Then people began to call on the name of Jehovah", @Genesis 4: 26. It is a matter of no distinction, *people* began to call on the name of Jehovah. The name of Jehovah is set over against a name that means nothing as regards distinction! That is an epoch, you begin there: "Then people began"; it is on the divine calendar. That particular time was the beginning of a great era, when man, hitherto dark, had begun to call on the name of Jehovah. I hope everyone here understands that we have to call on that name, for that is where we begin to get distinction, and a distinction that runs on into eternity. It is implied in baptism.
Then as you come down the line you come to Shem, who was contemporary with the men of renown spoken of in @Genesis 6. His name means 'name or renown', it is something; and his father's name was something, for Noah means 'rest'. Shem means renown but not as we have been speaking of it in connection with Cain and Babel. Shem was the second son of Noah, he was said to be the brother of Japheth the elder, and Ham was the youngest. I want you to notice that, dear brethren, because the line of Shem includes all the names of glory in relation to Abraham's line; so that the name given to him was substantial; there was something there. Shem led in the hiding of his father's nakedness, an important matter in this thought of name. Anyone given to exposing, or criticising, or making little of the brethren, or doing or saying anything that discredits the brethren is unworthy of a name; that name shall perish. Shem was the opposite of that, and so we find that when the genealogies are given with Japheth and Ham, Shem's is given last in chapter 10, but then it is given by itself in chapter 11. That is to say, the true idea of
{67}
name is brought in by the Spirit of God as Babel is written on all else. We want to get on to that line, dear brethren, and remain in it, there is renown and increase in it: "Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Shem", @Genesis 9: 26.
I want to dwell upon how it works out in Jacob, that is the manner in which it is worked out in each believer. Jacob is the believer viewed as difficult to manage; every true believer says, 'That is I, difficult to manage'. You must never say a brother is beyond managing; he may be difficult, but he is not too difficult for God. Alas! for him if he is especially difficult. Jacob was a difficult man and his family was a difficult family, yet you get the house of God in connection with him. It is as if God would say, 'Difficult as he is, I will make him a trophy to shine in My house'. But then he has got to come to it that he is a difficult man. The most difficult man is the man who has not come to it; but Jacob did come to it. There is no time to go into details, but he came to it that he was a very difficult man, a man making a name for himself by riches, a man who went into business to build a name for himself. Jacob did that for twenty years; he went into business and was successful in business. But then success in business will never give you a name in the house of God; it will only detract from any little spirituality you may have. So when Jacob came back from Padan-aram, he sent a message to his brother and gave him an inventory of his wealth. The messengers returned to Jacob and told him that Esau was coming to meet him with four hundred men, which did not bode any good for Jacob! The great wealth of Jacob could be of no avail when Esau met him with four hundred men. So God meets Jacob, and He cripples him. That is what I want to speak of, dear brethren; a man may spend twenty years and make great wealth, and come back with it with the thought that it will add something to
{68}
him spiritually, whereas it is the very opposite; it all has to come down, it is absolutely useless in the house of God. Difficult as Jacob was, he was not too difficult for God; God loves to show how He can take the most difficult, and make him shine in His house in spite of the difficulty. That is what God is doing today. Who is not difficult? If you say you are not difficult, you cannot bring greater evidence as to how difficult you are! Some people are amiable, nice and genteel, and they think that is something for God; but it is just what they are naturally, and that has to go, it is no good for the house of God. So God meets Jacob, and cripples him; you know the history. God takes on this difficult man definitely, but then Jacob puts himself in the way of being taken on. He prayed, and God met him.
I want now to come to Jacob's entrance into the house, and what is more beautiful than to see a christian, hitherto difficult and occupied with moneymaking, to see that man brought into accord with the mind of God, wending his way to the house of God? That is chapter 35. Jacob is on his way to the house; I hope everybody here tonight is! There are many nominally in fellowship who never have wended their way by the Spirit of God into the house, or taken their place in it intelligently according to God. See how Jacob after all this extraordinary experience at Peniel built a house for himself at Succoth! A man makes his pile and builds his house, gets a bit of a show-place; he may have an altar there, may even have his Bible reading in the morning; he may attend the meetings, and call his altar by the name of El-Elohe-Israel, God, the God of Israel. You may say, 'What a fine man that is; he does not go in for the world'. But there he is at Shechem, he is not in the house. He may attend the meetings but he is not in the house characteristically. He may be in it abstractly, but he is not in it characteristically.
{69}
We see that God loved Jacob in spite of all, even though he was a difficult man. God loved him, and says to him, "Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there". @Genesis 34 is full of disgrace, but God takes advantage of the disgrace; we may thank God for it if it leads Jacob into the house. We would not encourage the conduct seen in that chapter, but God uses the very disgrace to induce Jacob to go into the house. God makes His own terms, He says, "Go up to Bethel ... and make there an altar unto the God that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother", @Genesis 35: 1. That is to say, God is now linking on two things; He is linking on Jacob's first spiritual experience in connection with the house, with the second spiritual experience into which He is going to bring him. When you reach the house you get your name and you begin to review your history from its beginning. I urge on everyone here to do that. Go back over your history, and see how God has worked with you with the result that you abominate your conduct, and magnify the work of God. You never cease while here to be a repentant sinner.
Jacob goes to his household and says, 'Put away your gods'; no doubt he knew they were there 'Purify yourselves and change your garments', and they did it. Then he goes to Luz, that is Bethel in the mind of God. God would have the idea of Bethel, the house of God, in our minds prominently. Jacob builds an altar there, and calls the place, not the altar, El-beth-el. At Shechem he called the altar El-Elohe-Israel, that was what he built; but *he* did not make the house of God: God makes the place, so he calls the place El-beth-el. The Spirit of God says of El-beth-el, that it is where God appeared to him when he fled from his brother. The brother is a link all through, as if throughout these chapters God would have Jacob never to forget his brother; that is essential.
{70}
It is as if God would say to Jacob, I would never have you forget your brother and his wrath, and how you fled from his presence, but I stood by you. If the brethren hate me, God stands by me, but I must not forget. Jacob called it El-beth-el; he reverted back to chapter 28, connecting the whole matter with the wrath of Esau and his fear of it. He was not a fit person for the house of God when he was fleeing from his brother; that must be settled first. It was, thank God, for he met his brother and was figuratively reconciled with Esau before he reached Bethel. That is one side of the picture, that is chapter 33. Then in chapter 35:9 - 15 we have a paragraph which gives us God's view of this whole matter; it is an abridgement of what happened after Jacob came back from Padan-Aram, without giving the details of the history belonging to it. I wish, dear brethren, to point out what these verses really mean. They are the bringing together of the revelation of the divine name, the name of God, and the name of the believer, to show that they agree. The house of God is where God is, and where there is nothing that is not in accord with His mind; that is what the house of God really is. It is the bringing together of God Almighty and Israel. Almighty means He is here in the power of the Spirit, the power that wrought in Christ in raising Him from the dead. The almightiness of God is the power of the Holy Spirit that is here today; that power works in us, the believer is in accord with that; he is a prince. God has almighty power, He is God Almighty! He is in the house, and the believer has power there of *that* kind, not of any other. If one says, "Lord Jesus", he says it in the power of the Spirit of God; if one says, "Father", he says that by the Spirit of adoption; if he ministers he speaks in the house by the power of the Spirit of God. We may carry that on to the New Testament; the Lord says in @John 17, "I have made known to
{71}
them thy name, and will make it known; that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them". The complete correspondence there is in the way of love between the Father and the saints. The same kind of love, the most exalted, is the love the Father has for the Son, and *that* is in the saints. Christ is in the affections of the saints, as He is in the affections of God.
So you find here it does not say that Jacob names the place Beth-el, because it is where God appeared to him when he fled from his brother: No! that is shut out in these verses; Esau's wrath has gone into oblivion, it has no place in the house. It would be a terrible thing to bring the idea of hatred among the brethren into the house, it has no place there. Why then does he call the name of the place Beth-el? Because it was "where God had talked with him" (verse 15); that is the place now, the place where God speaks with us. Have we all understood this experience? It is a question of the place where He speaks with us. He has had us in the house on His own terms; it is a place suitable to Him, and He speaks in that place, Beth-el. The house of God is the place where God speaks to His people, and goes up from them. I hope the Lord will help us to see what it is to be in the house, not in the place where He appeared to me in relation to the wrath of my brother, but where He speaks with me Himself, telling me about Himself. What does He say about Himself? He discloses His name, He speaks about Himself; and then He speaks about Jacob, and changes his name. He says to Jacob, Under these circumstances you can multiply. Think of a multiplication of a Jacob like this! That is the kind of thing in the house, the multiplication of persons: "Be fruitful and multiply". This corresponds with @Psalm 113: 9, "He maketh the barren woman to keep house, as a joyful mother of sons". Here it is not only the housekeeping, but
{72}
the person in it, such a person as God could speak with, in a place suitable for such holy conversation. Think of the holiness involved, the disclosure of the name of God, and then the disclosure of the believer's name, of how heaven regards you! I do not know anything more interesting and important than that we should understand this; hence Jacob not only calls the place now by its proper name, but he sets up a stone pillar. It is not a stone to he on, as in chapter 28, but the point is the material of the pillar, a pillar of stone, it is durable, something to last. I see now that I am to last, not only in the house, but that I am a stone in the house. The Son abides for ever in the house. The idea of a stone is permanency. Then Jacob pours on the stone "a drink-offering, and poured oil on it". He not only anoints it but he says virtually, I am going to stay, and God is pleased to have me stay. The Son abides in the house for ever. "If therefore the Son shall set you free, ye shall be really free", @John 8:36. I am free in the house. Now I want you to see what Elisha is in Bethel, in @2 Kings 2. Elisha is the believer, and Elijah is the representative of God. The time had come for Elijah to be taken up to heaven in the whirlwind. He went from Gilgal to Bethel with Elisha. The first point reached is Bethel, then Jericho, and then the Jordan from where Elijah ascended. But I am speaking now of Bethel and I want to link Bethel here with @Genesis 35. There are two persons here in Bethel and in @Genesis 35 we have two persons, Jehovah, God Almighty, and Jacob; and they are conversing at Bethel. That is not at the street corner, nor is it the worthless talk which, alas!, is often current among us. The conversation at Bethel means spiritual, holy converse. Now Elijah is speaking to Elisha, and for the first time he addresses him by name, he says, "Elisha". That is a beautiful thing to understand in the house of God. The representative of God is there in Elijah,
{73}
and myself. I am addressed by name, I am known now; it is not simply 'that brother or sister who was converted at such and such a place; I do not know his name'. Heaven never speaks like that, heaven is perfectly conversant with you from your beginning; heaven knows your name and regards you according to the work of God. You need have no feeling because this or that brother does not call you by name; that is his limitation, not yours. We must all admit our limitations, but heaven has none; your name is known there, everyone is known in heaven. In heaven there is no such thought as confusion as at Babel; everyone has his own distinction. There will be myriads there, and everyone will be distinguishable. So in the house, Elijah calls Elisha by name, he says, Elisha! It is the only mention of it in this section, and it brings out what I am saying, that your distinction is known, and the house is the place to call attention to it, the distinction is recognised. You will find that constantly in the New Testament. Take "Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from the field, the father of Alexander and Rufus", @Mark 15: 21. Who are they? Known persons; they would not be mentioned in that way if it were not so. Everyone is known according to his spiritual distinction; the point is to have a spiritual distinction. Elisha had a spiritual distinction.
That is what I had in my mind, that we might understand how names enter into the house, the thought of a divine name-the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and then the names of the saints. God help us to take up these things and understand how spirituality enters into the house.
{74}
BRETHREN, TRUE AND FALSE
@Malachi 1: 1 - 5; @Malachi 3: 10 - 12, 16 - 18; @Malachi 4:2 - 6
J.T. This prophet has the character of the addresses to the assemblies in Revelation, and has a voice as coming in at the end of the last recorded appeal to Israel, as recognised of God in the Old Testament. I thought it would serve to furnish a word for us today, first, in regard to the idea of brethren. The ministry of the book is resultful, in that we have alluded to certain who "feared Jehovah" and "spoke often one to another". Those who feared the Lord are referred to in other prophets, but in none of them have we this touching characteristic, that they "spoke often one to another", meaning that the idea of brethren had a place with them. So we may perhaps be free to consider this subject of brethren as seen here in Jacob and Esau. They represent the brethren on the one hand in Jacob, as those whom God regards and loves, and on the other hand in Esau, as the false brethren. God said that He hated Esau and loved Jacob.
There is much in the book about love; it ought to have a great place with us. God calls attention to His love, the extent of it: "I have loved you, saith Jehovah" (chapter 1: 2), that ought to appeal to the brethren. The lovableness of the saints as indicated in Jacob is a matter of great interest; and the unlovableness of those who pretend to be brethren is of sorrowful interest but is also necessary to consider.
Ques. Have you in mind the mutuality of converse amongst brethren?
J.T. Yes, that was what I thought. We are not told what they said here, but we are told that they conversed often one with another; it is a mutual state of things.
{75}
W.S. What was there in Jacob so that God could say, "I loved Jacob"?
J.T. That is a most interesting enquiry, it takes us back to @Genesis 25 where it is said that Isaac loved Esau because he partook of his venison. Esau was an object of love on natural grounds, and for natural reasons; whereas it is said of Rebecca that she loved Jacob; that is, there was, at the outset of Jacob's history, one who was in accord with the mind of God. It does not say at the beginning that God loved Jacob and hated Esau; it was when the characteristics of both became manifested, but we get the root of the matter in @Genesis 25. Although Jacob was naturally a more undesirable, unlovable man than his brother, it is not a question merely of nature, but of what is of God, and what is of the flesh. What was of God came to light early in Jacob: he was a supplanter. He began early to show his disapproval of the natural in his brother. He was a plain man dwelling in tents, whereas Esau was a man of the field.
H.E.S. Are you suggesting that in principle Jacob valued what was spiritual? In regard to Esau, what was natural came to light, whereas with Jacob what was spiritual came to light; he was appreciative of what was of God.
J.T. Yes. We should all take notice of what marked Esau, which worked out later in such a way that God has to say He hated him. He is marked as a man of the field; it would be well if the young people would particularly notice this, for he would go in for what marks the field, sports and the gun and so forth. He was occupied with the natural tastes of Isaac, whereas Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents, he had a pilgrim character. His mother, who had communications from God about both of them, was affected by these communications, and she loved Jacob, and went so far as to be ready to be a curse for him. So we have at that early date, the idea of
{76}
what God loves in the brethren. They value what is of Him, and retain simplicity in their dwelling and occupations, while valuing what is of God. Jacob valued the birthright, and he secured it. Esau went in for royalty and earthly glory at once, whereas Jacob says, "I wait for thy salvation, O Jehovah". Instead of going in for things in natural energy, he waits for God. These are the general traits of Jacob; there was much otherwise, but God takes account of what was of Himself in Jacob, and how it worked out down the ages in the brotherly spirit; whereas Esau was increasingly unbrotherly. Although he affected to be reconciled to Jacob, yet he was always ready to take advantage of an opportunity to attack his brother, although God gave him every occasion to manifest the spirit of a brother; yet down the ages he got worse and worse. The Spirit of God writes largely about the conduct and spirit of Edom before God says anything as to His hatred of him. We have the whole book of Obadiah calling attention to Esau, and it is well to have this in mind, because today we are in the presence of the same spirit. Paul speaks of "false brethren", not our brethren around who are not walking with us, but that there is a spirit abroad like that of Esau. God is calling attention to it, and says He hates it; but He also reminds us of what He loves, so that lovable features should be with us. That is what the book of Malachi would point out. Although we may not have the spirit of Edom, yet there is great carelessness in the way we take up divine things; the trend of the book shows their carelessness as to God and His rights.
Ques. Does the spirit of a brother come out in what the Lord said to Philadelphia in @Revelation 3?
J.T. The word 'Philadelphia' means brotherly love and so comes in very appropriately here; there is nothing there of the traits we find in this book, nothing is said of carelessness as to the rights of God, in the
{77}
address to Philadelphia. God begins in @Malachi 1 with His own love, as if He deserved better service. He says, "If Edom say, We are broken down, but we will build again the ruined places,-thus saith Jehovah of hosts: They shall build, but I will throw down; and men shall call them the territory of wickedness, and the people against whom Jehovah hath indignation for ever. And your eyes shall see it, and ye shall say, Jehovah is magnified beyond the border of Israel". God calls attention to His steady opposition to the spirit of the false brother; they say they will build, but God is against them.
H.E.S. Have we to especially notice the strong expression God uses in regard to Esau, "I hated Esau"?
J.T. It is a very strong expression, you would not use it against any persons now. It is a question of the spirit that marked Edom down the ages. For instance, when Israel was about to enter Canaan, he addressed Esau very courteously and respectfully, asking the privilege of going through his territory on the highway, but Esau would not allow it, he was unreasonable, and Israel had to go round. God did not like that; He does not like unreasonableness among the brethren. The point is, what is this Edom feature? It is unreasonableness, and it may be found in any of us today, causing our brethren to go round, affording them inconvenience, when there is no ground for it. It was not going to cost Edom anything; Israel was going to pay for all that they used.
Ques. What would be the difference between them and Laodicea?
J.T. The Laodiceans were rich and increased with goods and had need of nothing, they were neither cold nor hot.
We find in Esau's later history, that he had hatred to his brother Jacob, and became more and more resentful of his brother. When we come to the
{78}
prophets we find that one and another call attention to the unreasoning hatred of Edom.
Ques. Would you say this feature culminated in Herod when he slew John the baptist, the most precious thing in his kingdom?
J.T. Yes, he was an Edomite. He represented the Edomite in the times of John the baptist, and of Christ, and in the time of the apostles, so that though he had the most lovable persons to deal with, yet he treated them murderously. It culminated in the fact that the One to whom heaven opened, and to whom the voice came, saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight", became the object of Herod's bitterest opposition and hatred. That is the history of Edom. In the Old Testament his history is prolonged and extended and called attention to on every side, to impress upon us what God thinks of the unbrotherly spirit, so that we may judge our hearts of everything that is unbrotherly.
Ques. Was Judas a false brother?
J.T. No one had a greater opportunity of proving real brotherly feeling than Judas. He had the place of friendship with Christ, "Mine own familiar friend", the Lord calls him (@Psalm 41: 9), but in spite of that he was the traitor. There is nothing arbitrary in God saying He hated Esau: it is slow in coming to light and extended over a long period, which proves that God gave him the fullest opportunity to show the brotherly spirit; but Esau disliked Israel, and would not let him pass his territory, so Israel turned away. The brotherly spirit was there, but Esau did not reciprocate it.
C.O.B. Is it a question of election?
J.T. That is the accumulation of divine sovereignty alluded to in @Romans 9. There it is a question of election. God's choice proves to be right, a very comforting consideration. You say, I know that in result God will bring me round to His thought; but
{79}
the point is that I should be proving God's choice now, that it is acceptable to me, that there is no mistake. Hence we have, that "the elect ... may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus"; all proves that the choice is right, that God made no mistake. It is very humbling if we do not answer now to the election of God.
Ques. Is it right to discern between the natural and spiritual brother?
J.T. That is what this book does-it discerns between a brother marked by appreciation for what is of God and by lovableness, and a brother who is governed by natural propensities, which Esau represents. God has given us an extended public history of Edom, and He finishes up with this terrible word, "I hated Esau"! It is not arbitrary, because he was hateful, whereas Jacob was lovable and God loved him. It is a question of lovableness in the true brethren, and hatefulness in the false brethren.
Ques. We are dependent on the work of God entirely to be delivered from the Esau features, and formed in the Jacob features?
J.T. Yes, that is the point. The Lord takes the matter up in Matthew; He takes it up immediately on the mount, and says, "If therefore thou shouldest offer thy gift at the altar, and there shouldest remember that thy brother has something against thee, leave there thy gift before the altar, and first go, be reconciled to thy brother", @Matthew 5: 23, 24. The Lord takes up the subject immediately, showing how Matthew links on with the Old Testament. It is a question of giving a brother every opportunity if he has something against you; you are to try your utmost to secure him: "Be reconciled to thy brother".
Ques. The Lord would not have a single exercise or question left between brother and brother?
J.T. That is so. The question between Esau and Jacob remained for twenty years. Jacob had incurred
{80}
Esau's hostility and it was a hard matter to settle it. It was settled externally as far as Esau was concerned, but it cost Jacob a great deal of thought, sorrow, and anxiety, before he was able to secure his brother; he had to wrestle with God. Jacob agonised in view of meeting Esau, but God answered him, and Esau was met and reconciled. I do not say he was really affected; but God allowed the thing to take place as a type of how the brethren may be secured, and thus @Matthew 5 may be carried out.
Ques. Is it like @1 Corinthians 13? If love is lacking I am nothing; I may have other things but love is the great thing.
J.T. Yes, it is a question of love. The book of Malachi begins with that, God is calling our attention to the fact, "I have loved you". The sense of this had waned in Corinth. Paul speaks much of the love of God: "The Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me", @Galatians 2: 20. "Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son a propitiation for our sins", @1 John 4: 10. That is testified to in Corinth; the new covenant is brought in there, too, but there was no outward response; they had not love amongst themselves; there were parties among them. Therefore @1 Corinthians 13 is a very important scripture. The apostle has to speak of love in the abstract, he cannot say it characterised them.
Ques. Was Judas Iscariote a false brother?
J.T. Yes, he was. When he went out the Lord enjoined love among the brethren, "By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves", @John 13:35. Love among ourselves, is love among the brethren. "*We* know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren". Two things were to mark them: they were born of God, and had the spirit of love; there is nothing else like that in heaven or earth and it
{81}
marks the brethren of the present dispensation. The Lord said of the remnant of Israel, "In them is all my delight", @Psalm 16: 3. The idea is that they were delightful, they were companionable spiritually; that is what Malachi leads us on to: "They ... spoke often one to another"; their converse was so delightful that heaven took account of it.
Ques. Did the undercurrent of hatred run through Esau's life?
J.T. It soon began to show itself; he professed to be reconciled, he took that ground, according to @Genesis 38, but as Israel began to move spiritually towards the land, his enmity was aroused. The spiritual movements in the true brethren are sure to draw out the Edomite character in the false brethren. As soon as Jacob moved towards the land, Esau showed his disposition, he would not allow Jacob to cross his country, a most unreasonable rebuff from a brother. From that day onwards God enjoins Israel not to interfere with Edom; He said, "I have given mount Seir as a possession unto Esau" (@Deuteronomy 2: 5), and you are not to interfere with that. Yet as Jacob moved on into the land, Esau's especial opposition began to show itself, and from that day he showed nothing but opposition against Israel.
The two lines may be understood in the two blessings; it says, "Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau". It may be enquired, Why was Esau blessed, if he was a false brother? There are thousands of brethren who have been blessed; everyone in christendom is blessed in a sense. We are in a favourable land. It says of Edom, when Isaac is blessing Esau, "Thy dwelling shall be of the fatness of the earth"; that is profession. With Jacob it is what was *given* to him, the blessing of Jacob is on the principle of gift. The blessing of Esau lies more in outward facts; he was to dwell on the fatness of the earth, but he would be ruled over by his brother, though in time he would
{82}
rove about, and break his yoke from off his neck; that is what the false brother does. We are enjoined to be subject to one another, but what Esau did is the history of false brethren throughout; they roam about and throw off the yoke.
Ques. Are the sons of God affected by this?
J.T. I think all that is in this book as marking Israel is simply the Edomite character, showing how the features of Edom may be found amongst those who are true brethren.
Ques. Is it the same principle that is found in the world, the spirit of violence and corruption as found with Edom in the Old and New Testament?
J.T. Quite so. Violence and corruption is what Edom has fully expressed.
In regard to the remaining features of this book, the Spirit of God calls attention to the gross negligence, you might say profanity, in the way the things of God were dealt with in Israel; but in spite of this God calls attention to His love for them and His preference for them. There is the love of preference as well as the love of sovereignty. God preferred Jacob, and He regards this little remnant at the end of the Old Testament as worthy, He treats them with the greatest respect, and not merely the remnant but the nation itself, although they were marked by the grossest disregard of the rights of God in their service to Him. Chapters 2 and 3 deal with that, the priests especially being taken up in chapter 2. In the presence of that God says, "From the rising of the sun even unto its setting my name shall be great among the nations; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure oblation: for my name shall be great among the nations, saith Jehovah of hosts". That is very comforting, God will have His rights answered to, and it is our privilege now to answer to them.
{83}
Ques. What had you in mind in referring to the majesty of God as a correction?
J.T. It says at the end of chapter 1, "I am a great King, saith Jehovah of hosts, and my name is terrible among the nations". God would remind us that He would be increasingly great in the eyes of some of His people. Is He great in *our* eyes?
Ques. Would the fear of the Lord be a recognition of His majesty?
J.T. Exactly. The fear of the Lord is the recognition of His majesty; He is a *great* King. It is time that we should begin to think about that. Paul says, "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?", @1 Corinthians 10: 22.
H.E.S. Do we have the same thought as in Corinthians, whatever they were, God is faithful?
J.T. That is right. You find it all through the two letters: "God is faithful, by whom ye have been called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord"; we can rely on that. "God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able to bear". "God is faithful".
Chapter 2 takes up the priests and brings out what they are, and what they were at the time the prophecy was written; it is distressing. God had made a covenant with Levi of life and peace. The priest's lips should keep knowledge; the priests normally should provide for the rights of God, and look after what is due to Him.
-.Y. Is the fear of the Lord what constitutes the fellowship?
J.T. It has that in view. As we get in 1 Corinthians, we come into the fellowship and we have to do with the Lord and with the brethren too. The fellowship implies that we have to do with the brethren; we are obligated to the brethren. In dealing with the subject the apostle runs on to the thought of the Lord; we cannot escape the eye of the Lord, we are not
{84}
stronger than He. The fear of the Lord is an important matter in the fellowship, if my conduct is not in keeping with the fellowship. The priesthood in chapter 2 is to secure the rights of God; the priest's lips should keep knowledge; the Lord is holding them, it is a question of the mouth. The priestly element is what should have to say to the carelessness, negligence and disrespect to be found among us. This book of Malachi is so comprehensive, showing such respect on the part of God for His people; He brings in the creation as a testimony. He goes back to Genesis as to brotherly love in chapter 2: 10, "Have we not all one father? Hath not one God created us? Why do we deal unfaithfully every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?". It is striking that the compiler of the prophecy has unfolded the respect on God's part for His people; they are clothed with these great creatorial and covenant thoughts, thoughts of love. In the last chapter we get what God commanded from Israel in the mount. God clothes us with these thoughts to encourage us to answer to His mind.
Ques. If we see how God respects His people it would make us respect them?
J.T. Yes, indeed, and have respect for Him too. The two things run together-reverence for God, and respect for His people.
Ques. Should "Sanctify the Lord the Christ in your hearts" govern our relations together?
J.T. Quite so. We have often said you can never love a person if you do not respect him. God showed that His love for Israel required respect; He accorded full respect to them as His people, although they were only a handful of the original. He did not regard them as babes, He brought in His great thoughts from creation down, even as to marriage in chapter 2, "Jehovah hath been a witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt
{85}
unfaithfully: yet she is thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant. And did not one make them? and the remnant of the Spirit was his". It is the original institution, and God brings all His great thoughts to bear upon it, and clothes us with ability to take them in, and answer to them. Why not? We have the Holy Spirit; God would bring us into full manhood to answer to His great thoughts. That is what He has in mind, all His great thoughts are to find response among us, to be received and carried out among us.
C.O.B. So we should learn to discern between the two lines?
J.T. Quite so. We are reminded in chapter 3 that God makes provision for any overture. He sends a messenger, "Behold I send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me". God constantly prepares His way among us in the way of ministry; and then He says, "The Lord whom ye seek will suddenly come to his temple, and the Angel of the covenant, ... ; behold, he cometh". That is solemn; things would happen suddenly after warning. God says in chapter 3, If I am dealing in a disciplinary way with you, "Ye are cursed with a curse" (verse g). Why is this? Because "Me ye rob, even this whole nation. Bring the whole tithe into the treasure-house". That is, God would have a people that were not half-and-half people, He would have people who were whole measure people. "Bring the whole tithe into the treasure-house, that there may be food in my house, and prove me now herewith, saith Jehovah of hosts, if I open not to you the windows of the heavens, and pour you out a blessing, till there be no place for it" (verse 10). I do not know anything of more interest than this; it is a question of what I bring into the house, whether I am a half measure or a whole measure person. The first man in Scripture who offered, after the flood, was an unselfish man: he offered of every clean beast and fowl; he did not reserve a thing; he
{86}
was an unselfish man. The poverty in the meetings is because of the want of the *whole* tithe.
H.E.S. Are you speaking of what is material in relation to the tithe, or of what is spiritual, or both?
J.T. Both, it is a question of love. Love may find occasion to express itself in a great variety of ways. It is a question of love, after all; that is what God thinks about, and it is behind all I do.
H.E.S. Is that why in Corinthians Paul finishes by a collection for the saints?
J.T. See how much he makes of the material side, but only because it is the occasion of expressing love. We were speaking this morning about the widow who gave all her living, and also about Paul's saying he would most gladly spend and be spent for the brethren. One might spend a fortune on a brother and never spend oneself, because after all it is not what I spend, but what I leave. If I have abundance left, I have not spent myself, there is no expenditure of self in that. The apostle says, "I shall most gladly spend and be utterly spent". To *spend myself*, that is the great thing. After all it is the person God wants; my means may be the opportunity of expressing love, but I must be spent myself.
Ques. Is that why it says that the Lord loved the church and gave Himself for it?
J.T. Exactly. The thing is to bring the whole tithe. I must get in my mind what God wants; He will take anything, He took the tenth Jacob offered.
Rem. Paul says, I have heard of your faith and love.
J.T. Quite so. Love is the thing.
Ques. Was that seen in @Psalm 133, the anointing of Aaron and that God there commands the blessing?
J.T. Exactly. The blessing is secured by what we do. Bring the whole tithe into the treasure-house, that there may be food there. That is a good reason, but the point is the thing should be there; God can add to that, but the idea is that you are doing it, a
{87}
very fine thing; it is your opportunity, but as we move, God moves; God adds to it.
You will find in the Acts how the thing progresses; the crowd of names in @Acts 1 means distinction, that is equal to wealth, then the Holy Spirit coming, added three thousand to that. Then when Peter and John go into the temple there was something to look at, "Look on us". Next Barnabas comes in; he lays what he has at the apostles feet, so it increases after that. At Antioch a large crowd were added to the Lord through Barnabas's preaching (chapter 11). Then chapter 13 brings out what was there, the assembly was much the richer spiritually for the five remarkable brethren mentioned in verse 1. I believe there would be greater gift among us were this principle of giving followed out on the part of the brethren, the full tithe.
Ques. Peter said, "Silver and gold I have not; but what I have, this give I to thee", is that the thought?
J.T. Quite so. It shows there was something there.
H.E.S. In a summarised way in this book of Malachi, do we get love in result, and hatred in result?
J.T. Yes, that is how it works out in the whole tithe being brought to God's house, "Bring the whole tithe into the treasure-house, that there may be food in my house, and prove me now herewith, saith Jehovah of hosts". God has it in mind to enrich and beautify us, so that the whole tithe will be brought in. God will be so delighted with the love shown in this way that all this will ensue.
Ques. "Present your bodies a living sacrifice"; would that be the whole tithe?
J.T. Yes, everyone has his body, that is more than money. Paul said, "I shall most gladly spend", that may be my money, "and be utterly spent", that is myself.
Rem. The widow in the gospel did not contribute much in money but infinitely much in intrinsic worth.
{88}
J.T. That is how the Lord regarded it; He looked up and saw her. @Malachi 3: 16 brings out great results for God in persons who feared Him. Others feared Him before, but we do not get this beautiful touch, "They that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another; and Jehovah observed it, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared Jehovah, and that thought upon his name. And they shall be unto me a peculiar treasure, saith Jehovah of hosts, in the day that I prepare; and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him" (verses 16, 17). Israel is spared as a man spareth his son, God speaks of their preciousness to Him in the day He has prepared; they will be a peculiar treasure to Him. In God's great preparation day, His grand display, Israel will have a peculiar place as His treasure.
C.O.B. Do you get God's respect for Israel in chapter 4?
J.T. Yes. We see how God regards them; what He commanded for all Israel ought to be remembered. The last verse of chapter 3 should be especially noticed, "And ye shall return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not". I think that is one of the greatest needs, for those who return to discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth Him not.
F.W. Is that how we are to discern our brother?
J.T. I think that is the way. A true brother is one who serves God, and he is not only a brother, but he is a son too, a son serves.
This last verse of chapter 3 is a moral thing; we are able to discern those who serve God. Many of our brethren are affiliated with a service little better than judaism, and in some instances even paganism; they cannot serve God in these circumstances. "Come
{89}
out from the midst of them, and be separated". Service can only be carried out on God's terms.
F.W. It needs spirituality to be moving on these lines?
J.T. That is what it culminates in in the closing verses of chapter 3; we reach a moral basis, arrived at by discerning those who serve God and those who do not.
The Edomite may be found among true brethren; we have to watch against it. The allusion to the son that serveth Him is very touching. He spares him "as a man spareth his own son that serveth him". The service of the son is very striking coming in here, and the ability to discern one who serves God, and one who does not.
In the next chapter we get a beautiful encouragement and announcement, "And unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth and leap like fatted calves". That is future; it is the hope we have and in which we are to abound. In New Testament language we are to "abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit". "Unto you that fear my name", that is a certain class of people, all who are looking for Him. Many take up the thought of the Lord's coming without corresponding to it, but here it links up the thought with fearing His name.
Ques. Why are Moses and Elias brought in at the end?
J.T. Moses represents the rights of God: "Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel". Elijah represents recovery, a remarkable thing at the end of the dispensation; "He shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers"; it is a household matter. The great servant Elijah is here linking up households, bringing parents and children into right relations with
{90}
one another, and surely according to God in a spiritual way.
Rem. Paul says, in @Acts 20, "Take heed therefore to yourselves", and calls attention to his hands.
J.T. Yes. In the second part of the chapter which records that memorable night when Eutychus was restored and they were comforted, Paul says, "Take heed to yourselves". He would say, You are to see that this mutual state of things continues, you are to watch yourselves so that mutual conditions can go on. "These hands ministered to my wants".
Whose hands? Paul's hands.
Ques. Are the results seen in the next chapter of the Acts?
J.T. Yes. They went down with their wives and children.
{91}
THE PRACTICAL WORKING OUT OF SONSHIP
@Galatians 3: 25; @Romans 8: 14; @Matthew 5: 9, 44, 45; @2 Samuel 7: 12, 14, 18
I have before me, dear brethren, to speak about sonship, often spoken about indeed, and yet I can hardly say well known. It is much spoken of in our holy conversations, and much sung about, included in our songs of praise, but I cannot say from observation that it is well known. I venture a few remarks on it, if possible to elucidate it and simplify it, without bringing it in any way within the level of our natural minds. The principle of ministry is faith, from faith to faith, so that we should be practically in the dispensation of God which is set up in faith. This subject of sonship brings in the sphere of faith in the most pointed manner. The apostle in writing to the Galatians occupies the whole of chapter 3 in enforcing the thought of faith. He treats of it as belonging to a certain era, as over against a previous era which was marked otherwise: hence the question of time enters into this chapter peculiarly. Indeed, dear brethren, when I speak of time, I may turn aside for a moment to point out that God does not just reckon it as we do, as men do, that is to say by the revolutions of the earth, as we understand it, or the sun. He has in mind His own work; He reckons time in relation to that. So that the first divisions of time are by God Himself, "And there was evening, and there was morning-the first day"; that is before we have any mention of the sun. So each day was a question of what God did, and that is how heaven is occupied with time; it is a question of what God has done, is doing, or will do. Hence we have the lives of men given so that we might reckon time. In @Genesis 5 we have not the lives of the descendants of Cain, but of Seth; that is to say, it is the life line; and so from
{92}
Abraham to Christ, it was a question of generations not years. In regard of sonship, which is also of faith, it must be a matter of the work of God. You will observe the expression in verse 23: "before faith came", and then in verse 25, "faith having come", the allusion being to time, but evidently not as we say A.D.-so-and-so, but as a question of the work of God, for faith is the work of God. God is occupied with what He is doing, and faith took form in man. I quite own that faith was in Jesus; but I should not call it the work of God there; Jesus is the Inaugurator of the great era of faith, He is said to be "the leader and completer of faith", but in us, it is the work of God. So the division of time in this chapter is *before* faith came, and *after* faith came. Now we live in the era after faith came, a great and wonderful dispensation is the dispensation of faith. I mention all these things so that you may have in view the place time has at the moment, in regard of what I have in mind. Faith having come, sonship has come, for sonship belongs to this era. All who have faith are sons, "Ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus". It is a very great fact for everyone to take into his soul, that it is his privilege to live in sonship, faith having come; it may be very little known in some of our souls, but it is true. If faith be true, then you come in for what belongs to the era of faith and, above all things, for this great relationship and dignity called sonship. "Faith having come, we are no longer under a tutor; for ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus".
Now, that is the first thing I wanted to lay down, so that each may be able to follow intelligently as seeing that what I have to say is directly for him. The Lord would press upon you again, if He has done it before, this great fact that sonship is yours, and it is yours in that you have faith. It is not that faith was not a necessity in Old Testament times, far otherwise; it
{93}
existed from the very beginning, but it is scarcely mentioned there, perhaps once or twice, for it was not the principle of God's dealings with man. It was there, and as real then as it is now, and equally of God, but it was not His public way of dealing; He was operating on the principle of sight, to bring out that, given every advantage, nothing can be made of the man after the flesh. Even the law, perfect as it was, "holy, and just, and good", perfected nothing, but faith having come, we have arrived at a period of perfection. Perfection is in the Son, finality is in the Son, and so the Son of God here upon earth, Jesus, inaugurated the great period marked by perfection and finality in which we have part. It is a period in which we have, as I say, perfection; we are enjoined to go on to perfection (@Hebrews 6: 1).
The Holy Spirit here, the Son having gone to heaven, has inaugurated the period of faith in a peculiar way. *He* is out of sight but the Holy Spirit is here operating, so that faith is specially the era to which sonship belongs. The Holy Spirit has come in to maintain it in a practical and living way, so that the mind of God is answered to. There is nothing in the Old Testament that concurs with the truth of sons; it was a time of children, a nursery time. That is what the apostle says in @Galatians 4, "We also, when we were children, were held in bondage ... but when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, come of woman, come under law, that he might redeem those under law, that we might receive sonship. But because ye are sons, God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father. So thou art no longer bondman, but son; but if son, heir also through God", @Galatians 4: 3 - 7. The position is most clearly stated, so that is every believer's relationship before God, however little his faith may be.
I want to show you from the passage in the Old Testament how this typically affected a man who
{94}
himself had faith. He nevertheless cannot be on the footing of Galatians, he was not. He belonged to the era of sight, when God was operating on that principle, yet he typified at least what I am saying. @2 Samuel 7 speaks of the desires of David to build a house for Jehovah, a most laudable thought. A thought which he poetically expresses in @Psalm 132: 4, 5: "I will not give sleep to mine eyes, slumber to mine eyelids, until I find out a place for Jehovah, habitations for the Mighty One of Jacob". That is one of the finest statements in the Scriptures! Nevertheless all David was able to do was to spread a tent in mount Zion for the ark. He deplored the accommodation offered to God, it was so mean, his own accommodation was much better. It happens often so with us, our personal accommodation is much better than what we offer to the Lord. David felt that, he said to Nathan, I would like to build a house for the Lord, and Nathan answers, "Go, do all that is in thy heart; for Jehovah is with thee". But a message came that night to Nathan, that he was to tell David that he was not to build the house. It must have been a humbling thing for David that God had to tell him what was in his heart was a right thing in itself, but *he* was not the one to do it. It was a humbling but wholesome thing to be told this; it made nothing of him. Christianity is far from being a one-man affair as regards our service down here, it is a mutual matter, and a matter of variety. God loves to have variety; David had to accept the message and he did so with the most beautiful grace. Instead of retiring to his house sulking like Ahab, as a disappointed man defeated in his great purpose, he does the very opposite to that. This is a thing every one of us should understand "King David went in and sat before Jehovah". He grasped the thought in the message sent him from the Lord by Nathan, the thought of sonship. He did not understand it as we do, but the Holy Spirit presents
{95}
facts to us in Scripture to elucidate a certain thought. There is a thought conveyed here in the message sent to David which inspired in his heart the sense of liberty with God. God tells him, "Thy seed ... it is he who shall build a house for my name"; if David's seed was to be a son, there was some encouragement for him in that. The Holy Spirit tells us in @Psalm 89 that David was a son. God says, "*He* shall call unto me, Thou art my father, ... I will make him firstborn", of course the allusion is to Christ, but nevertheless in principle it referred also to David. So he gathered up the promise; it is a great principle in the things of God to be able to gather up things, to get impressions and move in them. A divine impression is calculated to move me, what I do immediately after receiving it proves where I have got. So it tells us that David went in and sat before the Lord. It is the only place where we are told that he did this. Speaking is stressed here, and I call attention to it as the first feature of sonship characteristically. As the light of it comes into my soul by the Spirit I am adjusted, and the next thing is liberty; I have liberty with God. Many of us are bound in our souls, unable to speak to God in the assembly. I do not mean we are ashamed, but we are unable to speak to God as He should be spoken to, in the power of the Spirit. The Holy Spirit is down here in order to serve us in every possible way, and one way is that we might learn to speak to God, to cry "Abba, Father". That is in principle what comes out in David. He "went in and sat before Jehovah". It does not say that Jehovah sent for him; that would be another matter; if Jehovah had sent for him as His servant, he would go in and stand and await orders, that is what properly belongs to the servant: he awaits orders standing. We are not told what David entered into here, the point is he went in; it is the inwardness of the thing. That is to say, dear brethren, we have got to learn to
{96}
be spiritual and to leave aside material thoughts. David is the great representative of inwardness; he built inwardly. So here, David went in. How good it is to go in, to retire in the power of the Spirit into the presence of God in the light of sonship. As David sat, the light shone over him; would that we might experience this! The word 'sat' is used in the sense of 'tarried'. How delightful it was to God! David had accepted the will of God, although it had cut athwart his thoughts and ambitions to build the house; he accepts it and humbly enters in and sits before the Lord and speaks thus beautifully to Him.
The next feature I would dwell upon is in @Romans 8: 14. If I get the light of sonship in the period in which I am, the next thing is that I move in it in the spirit of adoption, and then I am to be led. The movements of David are not suggestive of the movements of the Spirit, they are his own movements; he moves of himself. But then there is such a thing exemplified in Scripture as a person moving by the Spirit. We have it in the Lord Jesus Himself, He was "led by the Spirit in the wilderness", according to @Luke 4. It concurs exactly with what comes out in the types; according to @Numbers 21 when Israel recognised the well, they sang, "Rise up, well! sing unto it", and after that they moved. The type answering to what I am speaking of is divinely fulfilled by the Lord Himself, and now by ourselves, in the measure in which we understand being led of the Spirit. So Israel went from point to point, pursuing a straight course until they reached mount Pisgah. There is nothing said about the ark, or the tabernacle, or the cloud; they had reached new ground, that is to say, the ground of inward acknowledgment of the presence of the Spirit of God. They moved on until they reached the top of Pisgah, which as it says, "looks over the surface of the waste", @Numbers 21: 20. On the other hand, it looks outward on the land,
{97}
though it does not say so in this place. The Holy Spirit would say, 'You must learn to let Me lead you and I will bring you to this point. The outlook from this point is on the land. Moses saw it from this point. I want you to look backwards, to take a retrospective view and see what God has been to you all these years, that you might love God'. The Holy Spirit does not make Himself a point in it, He is God, but He is here in a wonderfully lowly way to serve us, to bring God and Christ before us, so that we might love God. So the top of Pisgah looks over the surface of the waste.
We have the corresponding thought in Christ according to Luke, He was led in the wilderness for forty days. It would appear from Luke's presentation of the temptation that it lasted forty days, and afterwards He hungered. But the point is to see a Man led in the wilderness by the Spirit, not merely for Himself; no, beloved, it was for us. He was an example for us in everything. It says in @Romans 8: 14, "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, *these* are sons of God". Do we want to be like Jesus in the wilderness, led of the Spirit? *We* shall not be tempted of the devil; *He* was, in order to bring out His perfection. But there is the great principle of being led of the Spirit in the wilderness, so that we are marked off as sons of God. One could say much more about this matter of being led of the Spirit; it is one that deserves the greatest consideration, for the sons of God, and how they move, is not only for the wilderness, but goes on to eternity. The Holy Spirit is in them; He can lead them; they are entirely amenable to His manipulations, that is what enters into the assembly. What I have been speaking about is the wilderness and being led in it, but the assembly is Godward, it is not simply Pisgah. It is not what God has been to me in the wilderness, but God as known in *heaven*. This is one of the greatest suggestions conceivable to
{98}
the relation; how can I know such a relation save by the Spirit? He alone can give me interest, feelings and affections suited to that. What you get in the assembly would be a question of the Lord, He has to do with the approaches to the assembly, and to the assembly proper. You know how in the types, the approaches were presented both in the tabernacle and the temple; the temple proper was by itself, it was always an inner thing. We must not stop with the mere approaches, or even with the porch; we must get inside. The great thought of the Spirit is to lead us in, like David going in and sitting before the Lord. So when one says, 'Lord Jesus', that resounds in the precincts of the house. No one can say, Lord Jesus, but by the Spirit, and in the spirit of adoption, and that makes me recognise the authority of the Lord.
Then the next thing is, I can say, 'Abba, Father'. How do we do that? The word 'Abba' is not an English word, it is an Aramaic word meaning 'Father'. It is the very word the Lord Jesus used (@Mark 14: 36). It is to be treasured in that sense. The word 'Abba' brings into the scene the very voice of Jesus; the assembly will resound with that utterance, "Abba, Father". That is the thought the Spirit is leading me to; according to @Galatians 4 "God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father", which is in accord with @Romans 8: 15, "Whereby we cry, Abba, Father". Now, dear brethren, you will, I am sure, agree that this deserves our most profound consideration and attention, so that we may be in the assembly according to God, that our voices may resound in the approaches, and in the inner place; the very heaven itself is affected by the voices of the saints.
Now I come to the practical side in Matthew s, where the Lord is dealing with the darkness that came in through the tradition of the elders. The disciples were found among these things: the thoughts of
{99}
God handed down from Moses and the prophets had become darkness. I want you to understand this section; the Lord is speaking authoritatively on the mountain, glorifying the whole environment for faith. He stands out in it as the great Inaugurator of the new order of things, giving the word of authority which settles everything. What a great thing that is! Among the things He speaks of here, we have what we are to be called on a given occasion. The people of God are to be called "the sons of God". I may tell people I am a son of God, but if they are unregenerate it would be like casting pearls before swine; that knowledge does not belong to them; sonship belongs to another world. But there is to be a testimony here; the Lord says, "Blessed are the peace-makers". It is one thing to be a son of peace, and an important thing, too. There is no local meeting without a son of peace. The Lord says, 'If you find a son of peace, stay in that house, let your peace be on it, do not leave it, do not go from house to house, make it your headquarters in the place'. That is what it means, there is a place known, a peace-tent, and you stay there. The local assembly enters into that thought of a son of peace. But the son of peace is not necessarily a peace-maker; a maker of peace is a very great personage, one cannot be that who is not a son of peace. But one may be a son of peace, and not a peacemaker; that is to say, one to bring brethren together, to work with them. How can one do that, save as one gets down below them? In @Judges 8 the Ephraimites say to Gideon, 'Why have you not called us? We are a great people'. There is often that kind of thing in large meetings, and meetings where there is a gifted brother, but gift is not the idea for a local meeting; it is not intended for that, it is for the whole assembly-a gift has a general setting. Well, the Ephraimites disputed sharply with Gideon; they told him they were a great people and could do great
{100}
things. Gideon says to them, "What have I done now in comparison with you?". That is a peacemaker! Gideon had not broken the peace; he had got a great victory for Israel, yet he had to submit to these men who thought they were greater than he! Gideon became a peace-maker, he was a son of peace, but he was a peace-maker too. He appeased the brethren and established peace where there might have been war. A peace-maker is a man of immense importance; the Lord Jesus says of such in @Matthew 5, "*They* shall be called sons of God". God is a God of peace, He made peace Himself, and imparted it to us, and would bring us alongside Himself to teach us how to be peace-makers, that we might become repairers of the breach, able to bring brethren together, to help them judge themselves and get together. Moses attempted to do that at the beginning of his career and failed. He said, "Sirs, ye are brethren", which was a good remark for a prince in Israel to make about slaves. But the one who did wrong was a very hard man and Moses could not do anything with him, so Moses fled. It is very humbling to find brethren you cannot do anything with. Gideon succeeded; he was a peace-maker. "Blessed the peace-makers, for *they* shall be called sons of God". In @1 John 3: 1 it says, "That we should be called the children of God", but here it is sons of God; we are marked off in this practical way as sons in the sense that we have taken on the character of God as the great peace-maker and thus help to establish peace among our brethren.
The last point is at the end of @Matthew 5, "I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who insult you and persecute you, that ye may be the sons of your Father who is in the heavens". In the early verse it is, "*They* shall be called", now it is, "That ye may be the sons of your Father who is in the heavens"; it is a thing held out to you as characterising
{101}
you in an entirely new relationship. What a God He is! Look up at the sun in the morning as it rises-one often thanks God for it!-it is God's sun, and He makes it rise on evil and good. What a God He is! He is our great example; think of His bounty and beneficence! @Ecclesiastes 1: 5 says, "The sun also riseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to its place where it ariseth"; God is with every movement of the sun, with every blade of grass that grows, and with every seed planted on the earth. God brings up the sun and makes it to shine too, "He makes his sun rise on evil and good, and sends rain on just and unjust". I want to be like that God. It is a great aspiration which is set before us here, "That ye may be the sons of your Father". The Lord in Matthew stresses our relation with the Father, John says He is our Father only once in his gospel, but Matthew does very often. Think of God in heaven being my Father, how I should desire to be like that God! He makes His sun to rise on evil and good, and sends rain on just and unjust. What am I to do now? The Lord says, "Love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who insult you and persecute you, that ye may be the sons of your Father who is in the heavens". Well, dear brethren, the Lord has put this great thought within our reach; He has given us the light of sonship in our souls and hearts, so that we might accept the characteristics of our Father who is in the heavens, in regard to our enemies. The point here is in regard of those who hate and persecute us; they are not wanting, alas! but God turns circumstances into an occasion for the manifestation of Himself in His sons, "that ye may be the sons of your Father who is in the heavens".
It is thus we see what sonship means, and how it works out in a practical way here, so that we may really be the sons of our Father who is in the heavens.
{102}
MOUNTAINS
@Genesis 8: 4 - 12, 20, 21; @Genesis 12: 8; @Deuteronomy 33: 15; @2 Peter 1: 16 - 18
The thought that I had in mind to enlarge on is mountains. The first of the ancient mountains as mentioned in the verse in Deuteronomy refers to Joseph's land. Those of us who are conversant with that wonderful chapter will know the setting of the remarkable statement, "Blessed of Jehovah be his land!". Joseph, in that chapter, comes in for the most extensive, exalted and precious features of divine blessing. He represents Christ. To Him the inheritance belongs; the birthright was Joseph's. So that he sets out the thought of Christ as the heir. And Moses calls for the greatest blessing in the most priestly way, on that land. That land, dear brethren, is not to be inherited alone by Christ. We are joint heirs with Him, heirs together, it says, with Christ. This brings in suffering, that as we suffer with Him, we will be glorified with Him. For the blessing is for Joseph who is separated from his brethren, separated not by his own wish, but by their hatred, but he would not be alone. Indeed, the Lord Himself says, "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit". The "much fruit" is ourselves, the myriads of the redeemed who shall share that land with Him. So this should be of the deepest interest to every one of us. How richly that land is to be blessed! "Blessed of Jehovah be his land!".
But I wish to confine my remarks to the mountains -- the ancient mountains and the everlasting hills. Now in referring to mountains, dear brethren, I may remark that they have a great place in Scripture. They are first mentioned, as far as I remember, where I read
{103}
in Genesis, and they are mentioned by name. Their tops pierced the flood as it receded by the power of God, and we are told that the tops of the mountains were visible. All these mountains were taken into account. Scripture abounds with allusions to them. Ancient and everlasting ones are all in mind. The tops of them have just come into view, emerging from the deluge. As the earth emerged from the earlier deluge according to divine ordering in the first chapter, nothing is said about the tops of the high mountains. No doubt they had appeared first but there is nothing said about the mountains in @Genesis 1; but in @Genesis 8 the tops of the mountains appeared, as if the Holy Spirit fixes the mind upon them, and they are never to be lost to view henceforth. Scripture never loses sight of them. Indeed the gospel that is marked mostly by them is Matthew. The first one mentioned is used by the devil; it is a solemn thing to see what God intended to be in the mind of faith emerging from the deluge, giving way to the power of the devil, so that he uses it to take the Lord Jesus up to it and show to Him the panorama of this world and its glory, and he assumes that all that was his. Christians have to realise that the enemy has power to use the mountains, to give you a mistaken view, a panorama of the world to decoy you, to bring you under his power. He does not go to the extent of offering it all to us, but he will offer bits of it. Many have fallen under his power in that way, so that young men are enjoined to "love not the world, nor the things in the world". All the other mountains in Matthew are engaged with what the Lord Jesus would use. The mountains to which the enemy takes us afford us no precious things. There is no blessing from that quarter.
Well now, in making these remarks I wanted to stress that another feature in the mountain is that it is moral elevation. You see how much the judgment
{104}
rested on the level as compared with the mountain in @Genesis 8, so that the higher the elevation, the more what is morally degrading is withdrawn from. Hence in Matthew the first mountain the Lord went to, He sat there. It is a permanent thought and the disciples came to Him there; that is a key really to the subject in Matthew, the Lord sitting on the mount and the disciples coming to Him, and as they arrive He opened His mouth and said "blessed" nine times over. You can see how great the elevation is, and then there is the sense of instruction, a sense of blessing, a sense of quality there, for those nine cases of blessing are nine cases of quality, the fruit of the works of God, and as the Lord proceeds, you remember, three chapters 5, 6 and 7, are employed by the Spirit of God to give us an epitome of what He said on the mount, and the more you look into them, the more clarified your vision becomes as to everything. The most important thing in regard to the assembly is to have clear vision; that is what is needed, especially in relation to the assembly. It is a great thought in Matthew.
Now to go back to Deuteronomy, it speaks of the chief things, or the best things, or the head things, of the ancient mountains; that is, there are better and best in this. Now the word 'ancient', of course, is to direct your mind backwards. The next statement is the precious things of the everlasting hills; that is a forward thought, "the everlasting hills". Now I hope to be able to show a comparison, not minimising the best things of the ancient mountains, but you can see that that word 'precious' is a stronger thought than the word 'best', and so I proceed to consider the first mountain, which I take the liberty of regarding as the ancient mountain. The chapter affords us the things that the Holy Spirit has in mind, the best things, the best things of these mountains, not of all mountains. I want you to follow, dear brethren, what these best things are and share in them, and to share in them
{105}
now. Nothing we are to have in the future is to be unknown now. The principle is, that I have everything now, not in its fulness or in its blessedness, but I have it in principle, and if I have it in principle or, as it were, by sample, then I know that when I have it in its fulness it will not be unknown or strange. I shall be a stranger to nothing there, and that can only be by the earnest. God has given us the earnest into our hearts and that means that in principle I have everything that I will have in the future, so that I will be stranger to nothing, so that if I am to understand these things in the ancient mountains, I shall be obliged to look into them and see what they are, and so the Spirit of God tells us that after the long dreary days of the deluge (and one often tries to place oneself alongside of Noah in the ark-what an experience it must have been until the ship grounded. It was no such grounding as the apostle Paul experienced. There was no such pressure at Ararat), the judgment was resting where the ark grounded. It was resting, a very precious touch. We should learn rest, dear brethren, after judgment, after it is spent. That is to say, one can understand the joy, the thrill of salvation as we are grounded firmly on the mountains of Ararat. The great ship found a resting place, with its precious freight of living beings; foodstuffs and the like were not mentioned in that connection at all. We have to learn things spiritually. Food is not the point; the point is life, the matter of the people being alive.
What a thrill in every intelligent person there. What a thrill as the ark grounded firmly on the mountains. Why mountains? It is a spiritual thing, the sure foundation, you see. Well, that is one thought, and it is one of the chief thoughts of the ancient mountains. I ask you to picture it in your own mind what it was to Noah and his sons and their wives, to look out and see the glorious panorama of the tops of the mountains, never again to be out of view, always to be in
{106}
the view of faith henceforth. And then, dear brethren, another thing comes to light on Ararat besides this precious rest of soul after the judgment is spent, and the precious view, this grand vista of glory; we have to picture and consider ourselves for nearly a year in the deluge-what the vista was!-what was to be seen! And then going further there is the test of love, who was who. It was a question of species of life. Noah sends out the raven, meaning that species of creature. He is to be tested, for if the best things are to be brought into view, we have to be tested for our value.
It is a question of species, *the* raven. It would be carried through in all these trials as of value; now he is going to be tested. Every one of us has to be tested and these best things come out of the tests. That is where quality comes to light in a test, and God will test us. He does it constantly. The raven goes out and never comes back. There is not much in him.
Where is his love? He went to and fro; well, that is not much. There are some christians going to and fro; going hither and thither with no resting place at all, no place of life. Look at that ark resting on Ararat, a place of life. You cannot get the life else where. It is a question of the assembly. Thousands of christians can go in there. He sends out the dove, another species, that kind of creature is going to be tested, for there is treasure in this test. Now we come to one of the best things; would you not like to be like that, bringing in something like that, some indication of life, such as the olive leaf? He sent out the dove, it was a link with him. This is one of the best things of the ancient mountains. We should be like the dove; she found no resting place for the sole of her foot. It is a moral thought. There is nothing fit for me. When I scan christendom, I see nothing fit for me. The dove could find no place at all, so she came back. There is no time given, but she came back, so Noah put his hand out and took her in to him.
{107}
Then he waited and sent her out again. This is another test. What will she do now? The waters are abating. Well, you have the time spent out mentioned this time, a day's work. Every spiritual person thinks of a day's work. We like to be like God, and work by the day. The dove could do nothing the first day outside. The second visit she did something. She came back, and it is very beautiful; the spiritual person coming back to where his love is after his day's work. Barnabas and Paul went out and the brethren laid their hands on them, and they came back with something in their mouths, some evidence of the work of God. Sometimes the brethren come back and say, 'I do not see much change in him': that is a poor thing; when the dove came back she said, 'There is the result of my day's work'. It was a sufficient one! Where did it grow? The ground was covered with death. It must have grown quickly. That was the move of spiritual energy. The corn dies, or it does not bring forth any fruit, so however you look at it, it is a wonderful thing. Here is life spoken of, as if spiritually she recognises life. There was growth in spite of the deluge, and the true workman would go back to his post having accomplished something; otherwise we are just roaming about like the raven.
God is a God of order. Well, she comes out a third time and she does not go back. That is perfect, it means that the judgment of God rests. These are some of the best things of the ancient mountains which we have to bring into Joseph's land so that there may be blessings there. How great is that thought, dear brethren.
The third thought is the altar. You can have nothing without that. In all these mountains I have read about there is an altar in each of them, and here Noah places an altar. We are told that he offered up of all clean fowl and of every clean beast on that altar. That means that Noah was an unselfish worker at
{108}
Ararat. And that is one of the best things that I can learn, that is to be unselfish. I hold nothing back from God. The last book in the Old Testament tells how unpleasurable the worshippers were to God, how they dishonoured Him by the kind of offerings they brought. Selfishness marked their offerings. So one of the best things of the ancient mountains is unselfishness at the altar, and God is pleased, for He smelt a sweet savour and He established a firm order of things. That is another good thing to see, the fervency of the divine order of things.
Well, now I go on to the second mountain. It has no name but it is on the east side of Bethel. That is the position in proximity to the house of God, and in gathering that is the place where brethren should pitch their altar. In that vicinity it is blessed. That is one of the best things of the ancient mountains, and that is that I pitch my altar at the mountain in proximity to the house of God. This mountain was not yet named, but the Spirit of God moves Abraham to this mountain. It is faith moving in relation to the house of God by instinct. In fact, I believe we know things by name as we know them in our souls. Abraham had thought extensively, so he pitched his altar at the mountain, on the east side and then in @Genesis 22 we have, I suppose, the climax to this subject. We have a mountain later where you get a heap of stones, a witness between two brothers that they should not pass to each other. Think of putting up a heap of stones that I should not pass to you, or that you should not pass to me. Of course they should pass, but that is not the idea. That is not one of the best things, but this mountain in chapter 22 is a chief mountain. God has a great deal of interest in this mountain. "One of the mountains which I will tell thee of" is in "the land of Moriah", which means a place where things are shown. Some say that this is the mountain on which the temple was built. Well,
{109}
that is questionable. The idea was that it was shown. This is in the land of Moriah, "one of the mountains which I will tell thee of". I would that we should get that into our souls. We have the great principle set up, the mountain of Jehovah on which will be provided. It is a mountain of Jehovah. You say you would like to get to that mountain. Well, so would I.
The Spirit of God would show it to you tonight. So Abraham and Isaac set out and he sees the place afar off. What I want to bring out is the unfaltering faith of Abraham, and his faith brought him to the point of correspondence with God. Now I want you to follow this. It is the mountain of God in a spiritual way, which is reached by faith. Thus God is reached in this chapter. But it is wonderful as you dwell on this chapter. Isaac is bearing the wood, a type of the Lord Jesus who bore His own cross. Abraham takes with him all the necessaries for the sacrifice. What a test to his faith! God would test Abraham. Is he equal? We come to one of the finest and best things of the ancient mountains with which the land of Joseph is blessed: faith that will go all the way, even to become correspondent with the blessed God Himself, who spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us. That is Abraham. That thought is one of the best things of the ancient mountains. I think it is as God brings us to that, that we find the rich lands. That means that our meetings, our assemblies, should be rich. Abraham walked in love. He never stopped on that way, as he went to Moriah. He walked in love. He would give up his best to God. He who loves God is to keep His commandments. There is no other way to show our love, than by keeping His commandments. If I do not keep His commandments, it is useless to talk about love. Abraham carried out the divine thought perfectly. He was an imitator of God, and walked in love, even as Christ offered Himself up.
That is the mountain. Think of him piling up the
{110}
wood! It means that there was plenty of it there. His son was to be offered and the wood was piled up, the son was bound to the altar, the knife was in the hand, and the hand was lifted up to slay his son. That is the best thing.
Dear brethren, let us enrich the land of Joseph with these precious things; these best things of the ancient mountains. Well, the time is gone, but let us look at the everlasting hills. I must just say a word and I do not think I can select a better scripture than the one read in Peter. None is more competent to speak about it than Peter, "For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of *his* majesty", @2 Peter 1: 16. That is a precious thing of the everlasting hills. That is Peter's word too, it is a choice word with Peter. "We ... were eyewitnesses of *his* majesty". He does not say anything about his own failure. That is not anything for Joseph's land. You do not bring self into Joseph's land. Peter slept with the others on the mountain, but he does not mention that here. He speaks about the precious things of the everlasting hills, and he says, "We ... were eyewitnesses of his majesty". What a thought of the majesty of God! Those who know Him love to consider it. There shall be no end to His majesty or His glory; He is Lord of glory. And then he goes on to say, "Such a voice being uttered to him by the excellent glory".
That is a precious thing. How one would love to hear that voice, as a voice from the "excellent glory", one of the precious things. Think of the man who used to be a fisherman, having the vocabulary of heaven from the "excellent glory". He says, "Such a voice being uttered ... . This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight". That is a precious thought of the everlasting hills-it is an eternal thought. It never ends. It is the delight of the Father in the Son.
{111}
He does not say here, "Hear him"; he leaves that out. That was the point of the mount, to hear Jesus, but Peter leaves that out here. He is talking about precious things, and the precious thought is that the Father loves the Son, and that the Father says, "This is my beloved Son". That is an eternal thought. "Hear him" is not the point in this chapter, but we should hear Him now. The point here is the delight of the Father in the Son, and that belongs to Joseph's land. How often we stress it in the assembly as we are gathered together-"This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight". That would be eternal. That precious thing of the everlasting hills is shared by us. Let us bring it into the assembly now, into Joseph's land, the blessings of the everlasting hills. The assembly comes in for a share of all these things, and we are to understand the majesty of Christ and the delight of the Father in Him.
Well, that is all that I had in mind, and may God help us in these matters to be drawn into moral elevation and eternal relations.
{112}
TRANSITION FROM THE REALM OF SIGHT
@Luke 24: 1 - 12; @Acts 1: 9 - 13; @John 20: 11 - 18
I purpose speaking of these scriptures, dear brethren, in the order in which I have read them. My purpose is not to dwell on them in any historic sense, or even in a doctrinal sense. My purpose is, by the Lord's help, to speak of them in their moral bearing, that is, in the sense in which they may enter into current exercises and conduct, or practice, among us. Indeed Scripture is never read aright, or studied aright, save as we keep the moral bearing in view. That is, they always speak to the reader.
Now what is in mind is the transition of the saints from the realm of sight to the realm of faith and the realm of the Spirit. This transition is needed by all of us at all times but by some in an especial manner, for we are exceedingly prone to walk by sight, to read Scripture on that principle, to attend meetings like this on that principle.
I have read from Luke and John because the witnesses, or persons at the sepulchre and at the ascension, in questioning the saints convey censure. What I have to say centres around the questions asked by the heavenly witnesses in these scriptures. You will observe they are in twos in Luke and John. Luke and John had in mind, under the guidance of the Spirit, the spirit of the dispensation. They are peculiarly feeling men, one greatly imbued by grace and the other by love, and they had in mind that the dispensation should carry on in the spirit proper to it. That is to say, Luke would maintain the spirit of grace sustained by the Lord's supper, and John would maintain the Spirit of Christ, which we get in Philippians, "The supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ" (chapter 1: 19). So in Luke as the saints are together
{113}
they are speaking about the Lord having appeared to Simon. That is grace, and immediately it is added "And they related what had happened on the way, and how he was made known to them in the breaking of bread", @Luke 24: 35. Then in John, on the other hand, the Lord "breathed into them, and says to them, Receive the Holy Spirit", @John 20: 22. That is to say, His own Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, is to mark us. As I said, Luke and John are particularly feeling men and they inject into the dispensation these features. And so the witnesses are in twos. It might be assumed that Matthew and Mark would be severer than Luke and John, but the angel in Matthew does not censure the women. He does not even question them. Others might fear, but he says,"Fear not *ye*",
@Matthew 28: 5. Stern as he was, his countenance like lightning so that the guards trembled and became as dead men for fear, he says to the women, "Fear not *ye*, for I know that ye seek Jesus the crucified one". You see how a heavenly representative can change his tone, can change his appearance and his attitude when speaking to the saints. To the guards and others that countenance was repelling, corresponding with that of our Lord Himself in the book of Revelation where He says to John, as He touched him with His right hand, "Fear not", @Revelation 1: 17. The attitude is changed at once as the saints are seen characteristically. Matthew is pleased to convey to us that heaven regards these women in their characteristic features, not in the immediate unbelief that marked them. It is surely obligatory upon us, in dealing with the saints, not to stress too much the immediate thing, if it be an offence, but regard what they are characteristically, or I may say, abstractly. Indeed, I doubt that one can help the saints save as one is able to take account of them abstractly. If I clothe them in my mind with the current thing, bad as it may be and needful as it may be to deal with it, if I clothe them with that in
{114}
my mind I shall not help them. I shall shrivel them up and discourage them. Whereas if I clothe them in my mind according to what they are characteristically, I shall help them because I afford to them a measure of moral power, that such a one should not be swallowed up with grief. Severe as Matthew is in dealing with Jerusalem, he would bring in the kindly thought of heaven in that stern angel who turns to the woman and, emphasising the pronoun, says, "Fear not ye, for I know that ye seek Jesus the crucified one". He gave them credit for what was uppermost in their hearts, they sought Him indeed, not alive but dead, but still they sought Him and they are accredited with the thought. And he adds to that, "He is not here, for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay", as much as to say, You have not come for nothing. The journey taken, although in unbelief, is not for nothing. It was worth while seeing the place where the Lord lay. Mark, as usual, agrees with Matthew in his account, not that he copies Matthew. There is no such thought in the evangelists. If anyone here has that thought that the evangelists copied, or borrowed, from one another, banish the thought! Each is taken up by the Spirit of God and caused to write what the Spirit saw was necessary. And so Mark is independent of Matthew as Matthew is independent of Mark. Each was taken up sovereignly by God. Mark follows closely on Matthew, only instead of a stern angel you have a young man. The word 'angel' is not employed. And he has no censure for the women although Mark makes more of the unbelief and rebukes it later. Yet he has no censure for the women. He says, "Ye seek Jesus, the Nazarene" (he adds that) "the crucified one. He is risen, he is not here", @Mark 16: 6. And then in both gospels they are sent with the message.
But Luke, gracious as he is, records what implies censure. And the result proves that the censure,
{115}
mild though it was, was worth while. There are two men here and they appear suddenly. One might introduce the thought of an assembly gathering. The women came with others. They had seen where the Lord had been placed in the grave. They were interested, intensely so, but the record shows that we may be intensely interested and yet dark. The record, therefore, is to rebuke the darkness so that it should be replaced by fight in our souls. Hence you have two men in shining garments. Heaven is greatly interested. Heaven is intensely interested in meetings like these, dear brethren, that where there has been darkness and confusion of thought there should be light. There is much more of it than we are aware of. So heaven thinks it worth while to delegate these shining ones. They bear the heavenly hue. They are shining, in bright garments, shining garments, and truly every minister is bound to consider whether he has these garments. Without the heavenly touch the clearest presentation of the truth must be wanting. It is the heavenly touch that elevates and there they are. They appear suddenly. The women come with prepared things which, in a certain way, may be right, but when we bring things for a dead Christ when there is no dead Christ, we are burdening ourselves unnecessarily, wasting our time. There is no dead Christ now, beloved, nor was there then. There never will be a dead Christ! These spices they had prepared were useless and worse than useless. They were the product of unbelief, the product of confusion, and so it is, that too much preparation for the assembly has the same character. Very often it denies, in effect, that there is anything in the assembly. They denied the riches of the assembly. Bringing these things with us may be right under certain circumstances but wrong under others, denying the unsearchable riches of Christ. The assembly is full of riches. It is a question of coming in a fit state, to be taken and
{116}
employed in the distribution of these riches. They had brought these things. They had prepared them carefully and they had brought them, but they found no dead Christ, no Christ at all. It is a sorrowful thing to come with our bundle, having Christ in mind, but in confusion, and we find no Christ at all! It is an empty state of things. If there is no Christ there is no assembly according to God.
So these two men in shining garments appear suddenly and they ask the question. I want you to fix your minds on this question now. There are three, perhaps four or five questions in the passages altogether. The first question here is: "Why seek ye the living one among the dead?". The living One, that is not just any living person; it is *the* living One; it is Christ. When you have an article in that way, it denotes the Person and Him alone. "Why seek ye the living one among the dead?". How many are doing that? You will bear in mind that I am speaking in a moral sense, making the thing applicable, not the doctrine side nor the historic, but the moral. How many there are in confusion, seeking the living One among the dead! These are most estimable people.
They are the excellent on the earth. The Lord Jesus called them that. There is no question of belittling anyone in saying what I am saying, but there are many seeking the living One among the dead. You will never find Him. He is not among the dead. He is alive, He is risen. He told you so, the men say. He told you in Galilee that He would rise. You are unbelieving about it; yet how much ministry God has given to His people these many, many years back, dear brethren! We have been told these things about Christ and the assembly, and yet we are overlooking, or ignoring, or forgetting! He *told* you so. He told you so in Galilee that He would rise. Let everyone search his heart as to the things he has been told, divinely told, and has forgotten, or neglected, or
{117}
ignored, perhaps refused. He told you, the men say, that He would rise. And they are looking for a dead Christ, looking for the living One among the dead! In their minds it was Christ dead. Let all of us look into our own hearts and see how this that we have been told divinely, fits us, whether it affects us, whether we are moving in it! This resulted well.
Well, I just wanted to show that these women went off and told the apostles and it says, "And their words appeared in their eyes as an idle tale". That is not very good, but it is not without some effect. That is to say, if the Lord adjusts me and I speak accordingly, I may count on something. They thought their tale was untrue but then it says, "But Peter, rising up, ran to the sepulchre". There is someone moving. I speak thus, dear brethren, that we may take heart. If we get one man, one brother or one sister, moving as a result of all that we have had these few days, something is effected; it is not lost. Peter is the leading man. He ran to the sepulchre. We are not told that he believed yet, but he noted how the clothes were lying, and if we follow up the history we shall see that his faith was affected. He believed, but for the moment he is running. There may be someone who has been hesitating in these meetings. We have not been in the custom of running at all. I doubt that there is much spiritual running today. It is rare to find it. We find Mary Magdalene running, and Peter and John running, and here Peter running alone. That is something. If there is someone here that has been hesitating, how great will be the joy of the brethren in hearing of you moving. May God grant it!
Well, Luke is aiming at the spirit of the dispensation. That is to be marked by grace and the Lord's supper is to sustain that. So he gives us again two men, not now at the grave-side but as Jesus ascended. Perhaps we are more unbelieving as to that, the heavenly side
{118}
of things, than as to the resurrection. You will remember how the sons of the prophets, in the days of Elisha, would fain have Elisha give up his faith, his belief, in the ascension of Elijah. They sent fifty strong men to verify that possibly "the Spirit of Jehovah have taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some ravine", @2 Kings 2: 16. That was unbelief, not only unbelief as to themselves but influencing others to unbelief.
Now these two men are on the opposite line. They are to ensure faith in the heavenly, and that our dispensation is not only to be a dispensation of grace sustained by the Lord's supper, but a dispensation of faith. As Paul says to Timothy, "God's dispensation, which is in faith", not in sight. We are apt to come to meetings like these in sight, young ones especially, and you miss it. They are intended to build up faith. The dispensation of God is in faith and that is what these two men are here for. The disciples had been listening to the Lord and He had been taken from them. They saw Him go up, a cloud having received Him out of their sight. All that is to establish faith, to show that the era of faith had begun, that is, the present time.
So these two men in white garments this time say (this is the second question), "Men of Galilee, why do ye stand looking into heaven?". That is the question. Men of Galilee-I suppose none of us here would repudiate the stigma of Galilee. "Behold, are not all these who are speaking Galilaeans?", @Acts 2:7. It had a stigma, it had reproach, Men of Galilee. These two men are heavenly representatives, but called men, in white garments, and they say, 'Men of Galilee, why are you doing so-and-so?'. That question is asked today, whatever it may be, whatever you may be doing that is not according to the light furnished, because these questions are instructive. They are educational. They allude back
{119}
to things already spoken, to light already given. "Why do ye stand looking into heaven?". How were they gazing up? With their naked eyes. If they had had telescopes I doubt not they would have used them. The astronomers gaze into heaven today. What do they find? Very confused things, and they are constantly changing their minds about them. Powerful though their telescopes may be, they are most unreliable. They admit it. "Why do ye stand looking into heaven?". Your natural eyes have seen a cloud that has received Jesus and you will never see Him again in that way. He is to be seen henceforth, during this dispensation, on the principle of faith. "We see Jesus", says the writer to the Hebrews, "... crowned with glory and honour" (@Hebrews 2: 9); it is not on the principle of sight but on the principle of faith and by the Spirit.
So the Lord honours faith in a striking way in speaking to Thomas who would continue the era of sight, the era of natural sensibilities and natural understanding. The Lord says to him, "Blessed they who have not seen and have believed", @John 20: 29. We want to be among those, dear brethren, who believe without seeing. These two men in white garments are there to introduce that, that henceforth these men of Galilee should be men of faith in keeping with the dispensation, as I was saying, which is one of faith. The result in their case, too, justified the testimony. Divine operations in this way are always resultful. I say this for our encouragement that our "toil is not in vain in the Lord", @1 Corinthians 15: 58. We can reckon that something will come out of every bit of labour rightly exercised. It is "not in vain in the Lord".
So it says, "Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called the mount of Olives, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath-day's journey off. And when they were come into the city, they went up to the
{120}
upper chamber, where were staying both Peter, and John, and James, ... with several women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren". That is another thing we should notice. Tonight we are about to disperse and perhaps we are relieved that we can. I mean to say that three days of meetings such as we have had suffice. There is abundant testimony in them from God, and there is a certain amount of relief with us in returning to our various localities.
Perhaps we cannot stand more. It is well to admit it.
But not so in the early days. It is as well to admit facts. They were staying there. You cannot say that the three hundred visitors here are staying in Toronto. You cannot use that word. They are barely visiting, but these dear people, full of holy love for God and Christ and for one another, were staying in that room. They were staying in that room in that building.
Staying in a seemly manner, of course, but they were staying; they were not in a hurry to get away. Heaven will not be a place where we shall have any desire to separate or retreat to our own places. Love will pervade. We shall "be filled even to all the fulness of God", @Ephesians 3: 19. Everyone stayed in it, infinitely satisfied in it. And that is the point here. They went to that place. Not to their several houses in Jerusalem, nor to the temple, but to the upper room.
It has a spiritual meaning governing the whole dispensation. It is over against man's conception of religion, man's heart; it is over against the whole religious system. It is the upper room, the moral superiority of christianity to all that.
Finally I want to show how John confirms all this and leads to results that also mark the dispensation and that are even superior, in a sense, to what Luke presents to us. He is concerned about the spiritual, not only that we should have faith but that we should be spiritual. We find that Mary remains after Peter and John go home. It says, "But Mary stood at the
{121}
tomb weeping without". Well, you say, There is not much christianity in that. What is there in that to evangelise the world? What is there in that to make disciples of all nations? No weeping woman would make disciples, certainly if the tears are tears arising from unbelief. It is well to face facts and however estimable this dear woman was, or is, she was weeping in darkness. There was no occasion for it. It was the wrong time. If she were weeping for an erring saint, it would be in order. If she had heard of Peter's denial of Christ, it would be in order, but not because of an empty sepulchre. And so she looks in. That is a movement that has its reward. The sepulchre anyway was something to her. The angel indeed had encouraged her in that: "Come, see the place where the Lord lay". Here it is two angels in white sitting. They are not weeping, they are not doleful, they are not disconsolate. One is placed at the head and the other at the feet where the body of Jesus had lain. They are in order, they are sitting in respect for the One who had been there, not the One who was there, but who had *been* there. He is elsewhere, but they respect the position. Two angels in white, not men but angels. John would say now, There is distance here in spite of your tears. There has been distance somewhere. God is not near in this. He is dealing with you at a distance. Not even two men with their sympathies but two angels in white.
And now the question: They say to her, "Woman". Not 'Mary'; that would not do. It is a question of distance. They do not call her by name. They say, "Woman, why dost thou weep?". This is a question. If we are weeping, if we are oppressed, if our tears flow, why? That is the question. Are they tears of darkness, of confusion, tears that should never flow? There are many such tears that should never flow. And there are tears that should flow every day, but
{122}
there are very few for the divine bottle. These are tears in regard of the testimony. "Why dost thou weep?". She says, "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him". She is in unbelief. Who are they that have taken away her Lord? She could not tell. Possibly she would say, These guards, or these wicked Jews. But the Lord Jesus had risen triumphantly. No one had taken Him away! The clothes lay there as they had been about His body; there had not been a struggle. He arose Himself, according to John. "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up", @John 2: 19. He came out of the grave triumphantly.
Well now, the time has gone but these questions are not for nothing. Mary looks around. If there are any here in this case in any way, grieving in unbelief and in confusion of thought, well, maybe you should look around; you have been looking in the wrong direction. She looked around and she saw Jesus standing. I beg of you to note the 'know nots' here. "Having said these things she turned backward and beholds Jesus standing there, and knew not that it was Jesus. Jesus says to her, Woman, why dost thou weep? Whom seekest thou? She, supposing that it was the gardener, says to him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. Jesus says to her, Mary". The Lord has a word for someone here tonight. You, Mary. You have been in confusion of thought. You love the Lord and He knows it, but you have been in confusion of thought. You have wept unnecessarily. He would say, "Why dost thou weep?", and call you by name, Mary. Then she turns all the way round. That is the point. You have to take up a new attitude. These turnings here are most instructive, these movements. That is my point, as to whether they apply and whether I am making room for them. "She, turning round, says to him in Hebrew, Rabboni".
{123}
That word means 'My Teacher', as much as to say that all these tears and sorrow and agony of soul are due to the want of teaching. Not that the teaching was not available but she had not appropriated it. There is no lack of teaching and light today, but the lack is in the appropriation. She says, My Teacher. The end is reached. Although she would touch the Lord, He says, "Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father". What precious thoughts are wrapped up in that word! "I have not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". And she went. The result is according to the Lord's design. She went to the disciples and told them "that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her". One would venture to suggest to the brethren as to these meetings, What will you carry away? What will be the result of them in your case, or in my case? The Lord intends results. What will you carry away to the saints? He says, "But go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". It is the heavenly side of the truth, eternal relationships. That is what God is aiming at. She went to the disciples and told them that she had seen the Lord and that He had spoken these things to her. Perfectly comely and suitable and, I may add, effective, for the next verse says that very day ('late in the night' as the word means) He went to the disciples where they were and the doors were shut. I believe the shut doors may be coupled with the message. She made the brethren exclusive. The adjustment of this woman led to a message being sent by her that made the brethren exclusive. We must not be afraid of the word 'exclusive'; not to be used in the narrow sense with which some charge us, but "through fear of the Jews". All the religious element, the accredited religious element, is shut out
{124}
in the doors being shut. We have often said, and it is well worth repeating, that the word 'doors' is in the plural. Spiritually there were as many doors as brethren in the place where the disciples *were* (the word 'assembled' should not be there). They are enriched by the message and the message makes them exclusive. If we can carry messages back to our meetings, making the brethren exclusive in the sense that it is to shut out what is religious in a worldly sense, we shall certainly reach the end the Lord has in mind. The result is that we have the Spirit of Christ. The way is made for the Lord, the true Solomon, to come in to establish peace, to bring into the company peace and joy. It is an exclusive company, filled with holy peace from the lips of Christ, from the presence of Christ, and with holy joy, for they were glad when they saw Him. Then He says to them, "As the Father sent me forth, I also send you. And having said this, he breathed into them, and says to them, Receive the Holy Spirit: whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained". I believe as the exclusive character of the thing is maintained with us we shall have the Spirit of Christ, and the power for ministry too, and forgiveness to our brethren all around us. "Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained". The Lord indicates His confidence to us under these circumstances.
I thought we might see the adjustment in the closing chapters of the gospels, how we are carried over from the realm of sight to the realm of faith and the realm of the Spirit.
{125}
THE SIGNS OF THE COVENANT
@Genesis 9: 8 - 17; @Genesis 17: 7 - 14; @Genesis 21: 28 - 32; @Genesis 31: 44 - 53
J.T. The first two scriptures we read refer to covenant relations on the part of God; and the last two on the part of men. The idea of covenant relations between God and His creation and with His people is a subject that runs through Scripture; and I thought the signs attaching to this in Genesis would occasion inquiry that may be helpful. And then covenant relations between men and men and between brethren is also a theme in the Scriptures; so I thought these two instances in Genesis would also help in that relation.
A.F.M. How do you understand the term 'covenant'?
J.T. Well, on God's part, as in Genesis, it is One entering into an engagement, having blessing in mind.
J.S. An engagement on God's part?
J.T. Yes, involving His faithfulness; and with regard to the new covenant, involving His love. It is entirely dependent upon Himself, and so the covenant in @Genesis 9 is perhaps the widest we have. It is a great public matter, the sign being visible in the creation during all these centuries.
C.A.M. Why is the covenant accompanied by a sign?
J.T. I think it shows God's consideration for us, to keep the thing before us that we should know we are under that covenant. It should increase in value to us. It wears well. We find an allusion to it in @Revelation 4: 3, where it speaks of the appearance of the rainbow like unto an emerald. That would indicate that it wears well, retaining its freshness.
C.A.M. Being preserved in heaven after all the history?
{126}
J.T. That is the idea in @Revelation 4. It is what God has there that John saw as he was caught up into heaven.
C.A.M. Would it refer to life, being like an emerald?
J.T. I thought that. I suppose *green* would mean that it has not grown old or faded or lost its value.
J.S. Would it, as seen in heaven around the throne, be a testimony to the faithfulness of God in government?
J.T. Just so. John, the prophet, saw an order of things in heaven by which God will fulfil His engagement; that He is the covenant-God of the creation. Creation itself is to be delivered; because the covenant was not only with Noah and his sons, but with the earth.
J. S. Is that why the throne comes into view at that juncture?
J.T. I think so; also all that goes with it. There is also a collateral idea in the elders in connection with the throne, God carrying down from the earliest days the idea of His relations with men themselves; now He is about to fulfil His engagement.
C.A.M. Would you say that whatever God had in history, whatever He set forth, would be preserved in heaven?
J.T. Yes; what is in heaven from the created things, intimates that God has preserved the thing.
J.S. And this sign, the rainbow, has been witnessed by men right down through the ages.
J.T. Yes; everywhere, in every clime, it has been a universal witness.
A.F.M. The testimony of the rainbow around the throne would have reference to the world to come; that that blessing will be fulfilled; life is to be behind everything on earth, vegetation, and everything. Is that your thought?
J.T. Yes, death will be annulled for the moment.
{127}
A.R.S. Every time the rainbow appears, it is really God speaking to men, reminding them of this covenant; but they do not regard that apparently.
J.T. It is not a cloud, not what might portend evil, but a bow. There it is; you see it.
A.R.S. I notice God makes a covenant not only with men but with the beasts as well. His whole creation, every creature, came in.
J.T. That is what I was saying; the whole creation is to be delivered from the bondage of corruption. This is a very important matter, because we, ourselves, have the firstfruits of the Spirit, but we anticipate the deliverance of the creation. The gospel, according to Mark, is to be preached unto all the creation. I think that links on with the thought of the covenant in @Genesis 9.
F.H.L. With men a covenant means an undertaking between two parties, but the divine thought is a little different: it is what God undertakes.
J.T. God proposed the thing. This covenant was certainly not proposed by Noah. Genesis always presents the great initial thought of things, God acting of Himself, and, here, in relation to creation; so that, on the basis of Noah's altar and what he offered upon it the relations of God with the creation henceforth are enhanced, because it is not merely in creatorial relations, but in deep redemptive relations. He smelled a sweet odour and on account of that He would not again cause a flood to come upon the earth, or curse the creation.
G.MacP. The covenant, as established for creatures, is redemptive?
J.T. On the basis of the altar, the offering of Noah.
J.S. The covenant begins with Noah and with all those who went out of the ark; I suppose with creation.
J.T. That is what it is. It is man and beast and the earth; the whole creation is affected. It is a great matter. If we are with God, we cannot help but
{128}
feel the groans, and this bow is to remind us of coming deliverance.
Ques. You were referring to the matter of the cloud signifying trouble. It says in @Psalm 77: "The thick clouds poured out water; the skies sent out a sound, yea, thine arrows went abroad" (verse 17). Would that indicate that the idea of trouble lies behind the thought of the cloud?
J.T. Yes; therefore the bow is all the more encouraging to man.
Ques. The covenant would be unconditional here?
J.T. Yes; it is God engaging Himself and furnishing the sign that He will carry out His obligation; and so the bow appearing in @Revelation 4 is, of course, the confirmation that God is coming in to fulfil His engagement.
R.W.S. This covenant is with the fowl, the cattle, the beasts, and all that came out of the ark, every beast of the earth. Is there any force in the fact that this covenant does not include the fish of the sea?
J.T. Well, the deluge did not affect the fish of the sea but only what breathed. I suppose the fish of the sea would be the element of the work of God that is underneath, going right through in all weathers. It is an abstract idea of the work of God.
Ques. Might it have reference to the *thought* of heaven coming in, in contrast to the ordered sphere in which Noah had principal control?
J.T. The fish of the sea are indeterminable to man; no census can be made of them. But the Lord knew about them; He could command the fish.
C.A.M. I suppose the signs God gives us correspond with the things He is giving. The impressive nature of the signs themselves shows how immense is this covenant. Only God could give such a suitable sign.
J.T. Yes, you have seen rainbows on the ocean sometimes. The bow makes a complete semi-circle, a
{129}
very fine sight! It is like God Himself, like the creation itself. It is correlative with the creation.
J.S. Does not the value of it lie as coming in subsequent to judgment?
J.T. I think so.
A.R. It is when God brings clouds over the earth that the bow is seen; so that in @Revelation 4, the bow is seen around the throne, as if to show that God was remembering His covenant in the midst of judgment. I *thought* @Revelation 4 would suggest God taking up again His relations with the earth; and, of course, judgment must precede His setting up of the kingdom; but it is suggested there that you have the idea of God being true to His word.
J.T. He is bringing thick clouds now; they are already visible, you might say. Terrible things are coming in; but, to faith, this bow is the guarantee that God is behind all that.
J.E.H. "On account of the elect those days shall be cut short", @Matthew 24: 22.
J. S. The moment the church is taken out of the world, the whole heavens will become overcast; impending judgment is imminent.
J.T. When the Lord upbraided the scribes for being able to read the face of the sky, He did not allude to the rainbow; but the faithful, the remnant, would understand. "On account of the elect those days shall be cut short"; that is, God is behind the scenes, and the bow is visible on the face of the cloud; hence, faith is sustained by the *thought* of God. This is a very great matter with the saints today because we are in the presence of such extraordinary exigencies arising in national, social, and economic affairs; and it is well for the saints to be intelligent as to this great *thought* of God for His creation, how He is behind everything.
C.A.M. We can commit ourselves to God as the faithful Creator. I was wondering whether the rainbow
{130}
in @Revelation 4 would be of special interest to the living creatures. I suppose you would say that they would be sympathetic with what was going to follow.
J.T. I think they would; that is the idea, life in the creation. The element of life is sympathetic with all that; and so, also, the element of experience in the twenty-four elders. That is the point for us today: to come into accord with the elders and the living creatures, indeed, into accord with the whole scene.
C.A.M. Do you not think that the idea of the covenant and the rainbow, being unconditional on God's part towards man, would be emphasised in a very peculiar way? The attitude of man would be so terrible and so opposed to God in every way, but God remains true to His covenant in spite of what men are and will be in the coming day.
J.T. John is caught up into heaven and saw it up there, which is very comforting; and it is for us to understand that whatever clouds we may see, the bow is there.
W.C. Is not the sun shining somewhere, when the bow is seen?
J.T. I suppose that is the idea, something like a prism, the rays of the sun form it. The sun is always shining; even if there are clouds, the sun is always behind.
W.C. I was thinking that the bow could not be seen were the sun not shining.
Ques. Would you say being "in the Spirit" (@Revelation 4) is like being behind the clouds, in a sense, with God, having an inside view of things?
J.T. So the light involved in the bow is from the Father of lights; all light comes from that direction.
J.T.Jr. The elders are sitting in white. Would this answer to the position of the saints today?
J.T. Well, you are restful in the knowledge of what is there. The means that God has of carrying
{131}
out His thoughts and effecting His will makes us restful; but then they cast their crowns before the throne. They are very reverential and worshipful. All that involves what we are going on with now. All those interested by the Spirit, are brought into the secret of all that.
Ques. How far back would the idea of the twenty-four elders go?
J.T. I think back to Abel.
A.R. This covenant was made with Noah and his sons. He spoke to them as if they were with Him in that. Would not the elders represent that, that they are with God in it?
J.T. Just so; the twenty-four elders and the living creatures denote the result of the testimony in men. The elders have experience with God, and the four living creatures would be the testimony that God has life in creation. They were reverential and worshipful. That is what God is doing now; He is forming the elders and the living creatures.
There would be enough in these scriptures for three or four days meetings, but it is just to get a cursory view here. We shall have to go on to Abraham, where the believer has the sign in himself. The covenant is carried down to a person.
J. S. Is that how we would couple the two covenants together?
J.T. Yes, I thought so. Now God is dealing with one man; and, in a way, any of us might say, God is dealing with me. It is a covenant between "me and thee"; so there is a sign in yourself; you do not have to go far. "For *we* are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and boast in Christ Jesus, and do not trust in flesh". That is the idea; it is the presence of the Holy Spirit in the believer that is a sign. God has entered into a covenant with him.
J.S. Would this be in keeping with Genesis, "The end of all flesh is come before me" (chapter 6: 13)?
{132}
J.T. Exactly; and the sign is in the believer. The Holy Spirit enables him to terminate the activity of the flesh in himself. That is a very important sign because it looks on to the day, of which we have already spoken, when all flesh will be brought down.
A.F.M. It is elective in that way; whereas, the first sign was universal. The second sign is personal and to a limited number.
J.T. That is how it stands. The bow is for the whole creation; circumcision, for the person that has it.
A.N.W. Has it a negative rather than a positive bearing?
J.T. I think so. @Romans 8 is the power to put to death.
A.N.W. Worshipping by the Spirit of God would be positive.
J.T. I think the general thought is that we are to control the flesh; you have the power to control it. What legislators have been unable to do in all ages, the believer has the power to do.
J.S. "Put to death therefore your members which are upon the earth", @Colossians 3: 5.
J.T. That is right, putting off the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of the Christ. The death of Christ gives you the power to do it.
W.B-w. @Philippians 3: 10 says, "To know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death". Is that the idea, that we might be able to walk before God in perfection?
J.T. That is the thought. He is giving this to Abraham on the principle of covenant and intimating that it is to be held on this principle; that is, what we are coming into is to be held on this principle, the disallowance of the flesh.
Ques. Is @Romans 7 entirely individual, like this covenant?
{133}
J.T. Quite so; it is a covenant matter, one going through the experience by which he arrives, through analysis, of what he is inwardly, disallowing the flesh and maintaining the good. That is the principle, and the Holy Spirit enables you to do it. You cannot do that without circumcision, that is, aside from the Spirit, which enables the believer to maintain what is effected in the death of Christ.
Rem. @Romans 7 is the struggle, and @Romans 8 is the enjoyment.
J.T. Yes, the victory, the power to overcome.
A.F.M. Where does Gilgal come in? Many important things were brought about there.
J.T. That is the putting off, the rolling away of the reproach of Egypt. They were circumcised a second time. It is the application of death. The principle is there, but the Spirit recognises and implies that it is confirmed; so that there is a rolling away. The sharpness of the knife means that the thing is thoroughly done. It is not concision, but circumcision. That shows the thing is thoroughly done.
C.A.M. The difference of the signs is very impressive. We had nothing to do with that marvellous rainbow, but this thing has severity in it. There is intensiveness; it is an individual thing. You feel how perfectly God makes the sign according to the end He has in His mind.
T.H. It is a sign of righteousness to Abraham. How do you account for righteousness?
J.T. It is the seal of righteousness there, which he had on the principle of faith. The point is that he had righteousness on the principle of faith, and the seal was to confirm it to him, which would be this circumcision.
A.N.W. Would you say how it stands in relation to baptism?
J.T. Well, there is a very close relation with circumcision, involving the Spirit. There is no way
{134}
by which I can control the flesh and hold it in the place where the judgment of God has put it, save by the Spirit.
Ques. Does baptism involve the thought of leaving the world, whereas circumcision has to do with ourselves in the flesh?
J.T. Yes, the first scriptures in @Genesis 7 and 8 involve baptism; and circumcision is in @Genesis 17. The covenant is the ground on which the inheritance is to be held. The inheritance promised is to be held in relation to the judgment of the flesh. God is not giving the inheritance to Ishmael, a man after the flesh; He is giving it to the child of promise, to those who are heirs according to promise: but then that is objective. Circumcision is the subjective answer, that I am disallowing the flesh daily.
A.R. Does not circumcision come in in the light of Isaac's being promised; that is, Christ coming into view, the heavenly Man? If I am a christian, I make myself a sharp knife.
J.T. Quite; the chapter is very instructive in that Abram carries it out immediately. God had come down to speak to him about it, and then breaks off the conversation and goes up. Abram applied it at once; there is no delay; and then God comes again and resumes the conversation; so that God honours us in that way, as we maintain this sign. You look at a brother and say, That man has the sign that he is walking in the Spirit; he is not walking after the flesh. You do not have to put a sign on him to show he is not buried, as in @Ezekiel 39: 15, "And the passers-by shall pass through the land, and when any seeth a man's bone, he shall set up a sign by it". He has a sign that ennobles him; he is an heir according to promise.
J.E.H. What about the monks in monasteries? What are they doing?
{135}
J.T. That is not controlling the flesh. You do not need to go into a monastery for that; the Spirit of God enables you to control the flesh. "Since then ye should go out of the world", @1 Corinthians 5: 10. They assume to go out of the world, but circumcision does not involve that; it implies that you are here where evil is and that you stand against it; you disallow it in yourself; and that is by the power of the Spirit.
C.A.M. The epistle to the Colossians refers to that monastic situation; whereas this is the genuine thing.
J.T. That is right. Monastic orders are condemned absolutely in chapter a, the very chapter in which it is said that it is the circumcision of Christ, "in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of the Christ" (verse ii). The putting off of the flesh in its totality is done by the Spirit.
W.B-w. The Philistines are called uncircumcised Philistines.
J.T. Constantly.
A.F.M. I suppose the monastic orders would be connected with the expression 'Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch'. That is putting oneself under the bondage of the flesh.
J.T. It is the gratification of the flesh, really, in these orders; it is the flesh in another form, the flesh fed in another form; whereas christianity is great enough to enable the believer to face the evil as it is and overcome it. He overcomes it in himself by the power of the Spirit.
Ques. This was illustrated in what David called Goliath. The sign about Goliath was that he was not circumcised. David called him an uncircumcised Philistine because he defied the armies of the living God. Would he be a type of flesh in activity?
J.T. He is a full expression of it. David was nothing but a stripling, and Goliath looked upon him with the utmost disdain, but David was in the power of the Spirit typically.
{136}
W.B-w. David used a stone.
J.T. I think the idea of the five smooth stones that he used would emphasise the action of the brook or valley. The action of the word on a soul makes it living and operative.
Rem. The idea of sanctification, too, would come in. It is not a promiscuous use of the Scriptures.
J.T. No, it is five *smooth* stones.
Rem. I was thinking of Paul at Corinth: "And my word and my preaching, not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power; that your faith might not stand in men's wisdom, but in God's power", @1 Corinthians 2: 4, 5. He had to do with an uncircumcised state there.
J.T. He was distinctly a circumcised man, moving in the power of the Spirit of God.
W.B-w. Among the Philistines?
J.T. He said so, "For I think that God has set us the apostles for the last, as appointed to death",
@1 Corinthians 4: 9. God set him in that relation-"appointed to death".
C.A.M. That is a remarkable allusion to a practical matter among us. If a brother evidences the sign, I suppose it would give you confidence in him. He would bear some feature of this thing.
J.T. I think that is the point in the sign. A sign is something that can be seen.
R.A.L. What are the brands of the Lord Jesus?
J.T. That is in Galatians. The judaisers were insisting on literal circumcision, but the apostle Paul's body was covered over with marks and scars indicating what he suffered for the Lord Jesus. The Lord says, "For I will shew to him how much he must suffer for my name", @Acts 9: 16. If you looked at that body, you would see the marks. He said, "From the Jews five times have I received forty stripes, save one",
@2 Corinthians 11: 24. Five times forty would be two hundred. What a terrible state his body must have been in!
{137}
That is what he means when he speaks of the brands of the Lord Jesus, over against the judaisers who were insisting on circumcision literally.
A.F.M. Was it not an honour to be linked with the apostle, according to the verse in Philippians "*We* are the circumcision"? It is an honour to be linked up with such a servant. I was wondering as to the practical results; that is, whether we take that position and can say "We".
J.T. That is the point. If I look at you and you look at me, we say, We have the sign; we have the evidence of the Spirit. That is the thought, that you have no confidence in the flesh. The worshipper must serve God by the Spirit, boasting in the Lord Jesus. In any brother or sister marked by these things, there is a sign that they belong to those who are under covenant with God, in connection with whom God has entered into a covenant.
Ques. Do you think it is possible for us to miss in discerning? It says in effect here that God and the individual are together, because the covenant is between "me and thee"; as if to say, God is able to detect the measure in which circumcision is carried out.
Rem. Moses's wife was getting some help on this matter.
J.T. Well, she was when it was applied. She said, "A bloody husband indeed art thou to me!", @Exodus 4: 25. That is what the Lord is to us. He understands all this. It is remarkable that God was about to kill Moses. He meant to do it unless circumcision was there.
J.S. Does this show the wisdom of the ways of God; that the inheritance is not to be had on the line of flesh, but in those that disallow the flesh?
J.T. God is not giving the inheritance to a man after the flesh. He would put the heir to death, "This is the heir; come, let us kill him and the inheritance will be ours", @Mark 12: 7. God is giving
{138}
the inheritance on the principle of sovereignty to those who disallow the flesh.
W.B-w. Do you think Moses fully understood after the circumcision of his sons, for he was going to be used in going back into Egypt and delivering the people?
J.T. That is what God is insisting on. It is a family matter really. That is how it is introduced here. Abraham was to do that and his whole house was circumcised.
Ques. Does the eighth day suggest a new beginning-from eight days old?
J.T. That gives a person individuality. It typifies the ego inherent in the person. Spiritually, you come to yourself, "*I myself*"; that is the sense. You accept that this must mark you. "So then *I myself* with the mind serve God's law", @Romans 7: 25.
Rem. A person eight days old can hardly circumcise himself.
J.T. That is not the idea. Eight days old spiritually is that you have come to the idea of personality.
T.H. Does Peter arrive at it when he says, "I am a sinful man"?
J.T. Quite; he saw how sinful he was. He was the circumcision. The sign stands connected with the Spirit as judging the flesh.
A.R. Is it not remarkable that the Spirit of God puts on record that Ishmael was taken first, and he was thirteen years of age?
J.T. That is to bring out the completeness of Abraham's obedience; that the thing is brought in on everyone in his house, from himself down.
Ques. Is the next visit based upon his obedience here?
J.T. Quite so; God breaks off the conversation here, and Abraham obeys, then God comes back to him.
R.D.G. Would it appear that even such a servant
{139}
as Moses was lax with regard to the covenant, so that God had to call it to his attention?
J.T. It shows how every one of us in the Lord's service needs to have it called to our attention. The reproach of Egypt rolls away when you apply it a second time. It is a very drastic thing. It remains as a sign. The person is marked off by this sign, which means that he is disallowing the flesh; he is walking in the Spirit, not fulfilling the lusts of the flesh.
A.F.M. I was thinking of this visit to Abraham.
He gets his name changed, in this connection. It is a remarkable visitation. Is not a lot in the way of light and blessing missed because we are not circumcised the second time? I think the thing is not carried out; it is accepted as a principle but not carried out.
Galatians insists on things being carried out. "For we, by the Spirit, on the principle of faith, await the hope of righteousness".
J.E.H. Would it correspond to going back to Gilgal?
J.T. Yes; that is the idea. One very interesting thing about Gilgal is that Judah and Joseph got their inheritance there. The others got theirs from Moses and at Shiloh, but Judah and Joseph got theirs at Gilgal, meaning that it is in that connection that the people are laying hold of the inheritance, not in the flesh, but in the Spirit; so in both these types you get persons that value the inheritance themselves, Caleb and the daughters of Zelophehad.
Now as regards the other two scriptures. The first relates to a beautiful feature of circumcision; that is, we have a circumcised man, and he sets seven ewe lambs by themselves in the presence of a Philistine, this big man that trusted to the flesh; and Abimelech says, What do you mean by these lambs? Well, Abraham says, I want them to be a witness with you that I dug this well. These ewe lambs would typify
{140}
the moral greatness in Abraham. It is a question of the Spirit.
J.E.H. Tell us about the significance of the *ewe* lamb.
J.T. I think the female usually stands for affection in the believer; that is, you serve by love. They do not represent the military, fleshly, energetic, aggressive spirit in us. The Philistine means that, a big man, a forceful man, a man that will take every opportunity to reach his ends. That is what he is; but a godly man, a believer in Christ that accepts the death of Christ in spirit is not that. He is of another spirit, but he is gaining on the Philistine. The Philistine has to come to that. What is the explanation of these seven ewe lambs; how do you account for them? Abraham says, That is my witness. They are not pugnacious; they are rather sensitive, retiring, and mild. It is the meekness of Christ. The apostle says, "But I myself, Paul, entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of the Christ", @2 Corinthians 10: 1. It is the power of God, but in that aspect.
Rem. "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit", @Zechariah 4: 6.
C.A.M. The very thing about the people of God is the sign. If we think of that, we will be nothing.
J.T. That is where our victory lies. 'Through weakness and defeat He won the meed and crown'. He was victorious, and that is what Abraham says he meant by the ewe lambs, and he gave them to Abimelech. That begins the history of Beersheba, the place of the oath.
G.MacP. Would it be the Spirit of Christ reflected in Abraham?
J.T. That is the idea; it is written for us. It is a very beautiful suggestion, these seven ewe lambs put by themselves in the presence of that big man and his captain. What would they be in the field of battle; what would they be in the mind of this Philistine?
{141}
Well, Abraham says, That is my thought; that is the secret of my power, and you are coming to me as captain.
J. S. "When I am weak, then I am powerful", @2 Corinthians 12: 10.
J.T.Jr. Would that come out in the Lord's testimony before Pilate?
J.T. That is where you see this fully exemplified.
Pilate says, "Behold the man!". He was affected himself by it.
And now in connection with the last scripture, here we have two brothers, two difficult brothers these are. The subject begins in chapter 31: 44: "And now, come, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be a witness between me and thee. And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. And Jacob said to his brethren, Gather stones. And they took stones, and made a heap, and ate there upon the heap". Now what is to be noticed is that Laban began the thought and Jacob took a stone and set it up for a pillar; that is, he is acting in a dignified way in taking a stone. He had done it before in a more exalted place, that is, at Bethel. But then he asks his brethren to gather stones. "And they took stones, and made a heap". I think this second movement of taking the stones and making a heap is a very discreditable thing. There should be nothing of this sort between brethren. The idea of a pillar set up is really a dignified thing, but there is nothing dignified about a heap of stones.
J.T.Jr. It says they ate over it.
J.T. It is not like the christian altar.
T.H. In Ecclesiastes it says, there is "a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together" (chapter 3: 5).
J.T. What I think we might notice is not to dwell too much on the discreditable side, but on the spiritual side. It is honourable and dignified enough as Jacob begins, setting up a pillar. That had been done
{142}
before, and later on in chapter 35, in a most dignified way; but this heap of stones is what is undignified.
A.R.S. Why is it that Jacob falls down in telling them to gather these stones?
J.T. He told them to gather the stones, but they made a heap. He did not tell them to make the heap. The Holy Spirit says they gathered stones and made a heap.
A.R.S. What would they do with them when they gathered them?
J.T. Well, it does not seem that they waited to ask Jacob what he had in his mind. Why did they not follow the lead he set?
W.B-w. There was a great distance between Laban and Jacob because Jacob had fled from Syria and Laban had followed.
J.T. Yes, there was. It was mutually understood that the distance was to be permanent, which is a most sorrowful thing. How poor this is! But Jacob gives a lead, and they do not take any notice. The important thing is if you get a lead, take notice of it. You may not have to do the same thing, but there is something that would be in keeping with it, and certainly a heap is not. "For the time shall be when they will not bear sound teaching; but according to their own lusts will heap up to themselves teachers, having an itching ear", @2 Timothy 4: 3.
J. S. There is nothing of any intelligence in a heap.
J.T. No; there is something in a pillar, something signified.
W.B-w. It says Jacob *took* a stone, and said to his brethren, *Gather* stones.
J.T. Well, you give a suggestion and this is what you get.
A.F.M. Why a covenant at all under such conditions? It looks as though Laban started it, not Jacob.
J.T. Well, if we have to make an engagement, well and good, such as Abraham and Abimelech did. And
{143}
so the importance of calling attention to this heap and how unbecoming it is amongst brethren. We want something distinguished, according to God, something that has some form, some symmetry, something that indicates pattern or definite thought. There is nothing at all in a heap.
J.S. Laban gives a good lead, "Come, let us make a covenant", and Jacob gives a good lead, but there is a complete falling down.
J.T. It is the brethren that are at fault, the ones that gathered the stones. The Holy Spirit says they made a heap, and that word runs through all that is said afterwards. They descend to the level of the heap. The whole scene is on very low ground. It is only to avoid the thing that one draws attention to it.
It is in keeping with the whole circumstance. They are going to be separate, and they are complaining against one another.
W.B-w. Apparently there was no brother there to right the situation.
J.T. There was no one there to do it. The thing is just accepted. These things drag along, and everybody knows that there is nothing in it, and that it is not according to God, and yet they act as if it were, the word 'heap' running right through.
Ques. Would Laban's past history with Jacob enter into that?
J.T. I suppose the whole circumstance is linked with it. Things happen in our histories that indicate what is underneath. This public testimony, as a witness to a covenant, is just a heap. If you ask somebody to go and see it, well, what is there in it? If I go to see Solomon's temple, I would see something, or the tabernacle: but there is nothing here but a heap. Certainly it is a sign, but it is no credit to either, as far as I see. It is called "Jegar-sahadutha", which is said to mean the same as "Galeed", a heap
{144}
of witness. The Spirit of God lets us have it, and then the word is used right down through the passage.
Ques. Would you say that there may appear to be a settlement in a locality, and it may be spoken of as a settlement, but still it may be a settlement on the basis of a heap rather than on a divine basis?
J.T. That is the idea, I think. We can learn something from this. It is not just what should be found among the people of God. It denotes a very low state of things; Jacob gives a good lead, and these brethren heap the stones together. Jacob does not take action, nor do they ask him or say, What is in your mind? Stones are very suggestive as types.
They are used in Peter as types of christians. The Lord uses them, too, as types of christians.
Alec R. Would that show the significance that when a brother gives a good lead, others should be prepared to follow instead of acting on different lines, as the heap would suggest?
J.T. That is what I was thinking. If you give a lead by a remark in a care meeting, a word that strikes me, I would want to follow that up. Perhaps you have more in your mind, and I would want to follow that up and have you say something more about it. It seems to me these brethren would have done well to say, Jacob, 'What have you got in mind? You have something on your mind'. They did not say that; they just made the heap.
A.N.W. Jacob's pillar remains distinct from the heap, throughout.
J.T. Jacob's act stands.
J.T.Jr. There is a distinction between what is right and what is wrong.
J.T. You feel there is nothing in a heap, no wisdom, skill, ornamentation, architecture, or anything.
A.R. It is there because two brothers are not reconciled.
{145}
J.T. It is God allowing the thing to happen as permanent testimony of what existed between these two brothers. There is no change at all.
A.F.M. Laban denoted the terms of his covenant and said, "Behold this heap, and behold the pillar which I have set up between me and thee: let this heap be witness, and the pillar a witness, that neither I pass this heap to go to thee, nor thou pass this heap and this pillar to come to me, for harm" (verses 51, 52).
Is that the secret of it? Would you say Laban was not reconciled?
J.T. It really was a testimony to what had gone between them.
A.R. The matter was not properly settled.
J.T. That is what I thought.
A.R. There was a tendency to compromise.
Rem. The heap had two names. It is rather poor business to have two names for a place.
J.T. Well, there is a further thought, watchfulness "Let Jehovah watch between me and thee, when we shall be hidden one from another" (verse 49). That is a poor thing. Why should we be hidden from one another? We want to see each other's faces.
J.S. Should not this have a direct application to our local meetings?
J.T. It is the sort of thing to be avoided; it is not an example.
C.A.M. Otherwise you will have an ungainly sort of sign.
J.T. Whenever you see it, it is a heap, a heap of witness.
Rem. A witness that keeps the brethren separate, keeping them apart.
J.T. "When we shall be hidden one from another".
Rem. The highest thought would be endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit.
J.T. Quite so; that is, face to face. John talked about the face. He said, "I would not write with
{146}
paper and ink; but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full", @2 @John 12. Even writing is not so good as seeing a man's face.
N.W. Is there any record that this was straightened out?
J.T. No, it is never straightened out. There it is between Laban and Jacob.
Ques. Do you think there are things in our local meetings that never get straightened out?
J.T. It is just a suggestion, and we want something more dignified. The pillar is dignified, but the heap is nothing at all. That is where they ate, on the heap.
That is a poor thing. It is an agreement to differ.
Rem. The brethren at Antioch would not have a heap. They looked into the matter and sent Paul to Jerusalem to get the matter straight.
Rem. When Peter came down, there was no heap there.
W.B-w. In 1 Corinthians Paul was not allowing a heap. He brought the matter before the brethren to put away that wicked person.
J.T. All to the end that there might be the unity of the Spirit.
{147}
SEEING WORLD CONDITIONS FROM THE DIVINE VIEWPOINT
"I will go down now, and see" Sodom, Jehovah said to Abraham. Think of God saying that to an actual man today; I am going out to see what is going on in England, in the world; to see what France is doing; what Italy is doing, or America. Is that not what God says, in effect? It is that exactly. God is concerned about all these matters. The two angels looked towards Sodom, and went towards Sodom. Jehovah looked towards Sodom, too. He was going that way. And then He says, 'I will tell Abraham about it'. Well, I pray to God regularly and ask Him to tell *me* about these things. God is concerned about international conditions. He has set up gentile monarchies and they are running their course. Has God forgotten what is said in the book of Daniel? No, beloved. The book of Daniel, and what is recorded in it, still exists. The monster that God showed Nebuchadnezzar still exists, in part. The monarchies are running their course: they are about at their end, and God would take us into His confidence as to what these things mean. It is most important that we should be with God about these things, to be instructed about them. "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing?".
So God spoke to Abraham about Sodom. And then it says that "Abraham drew near". How beautiful that is! And he said to God, "There are perhaps fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not forgive the place for the sake of the fifty righteous that are therein?". 'Yes, I will spare for fifty', God said. What a wonderful conversation that was-Abraham interceding for the world, with a
{148}
view, of course, to saving his brother Lot who was in it. Should we not intercede for the world, with a view to our brethren in it, our Lots that are in it, that they might be rescued out of it? Well, God said that He would spare Sodom for fifty. Then Abraham said, Will You not spare it for forty-five? Yes, for forty-five. For forty? Yes, for forty. For thirty? Yes, for thirty. For twenty? Yes, for twenty. For ten? Yes, for ten. That is God, beloved, speaking to His friend. Abraham did not venture to go below ten. And so God left Abraham; the conversation was ended. That is how it stands; God did not break it off; it was a finished matter. "Jehovah went away when he had ended speaking to Abraham; and Abraham returned to his place".
Presently the flames of Sodom arose and a smoke went up from the land as the smoke of a furnace. The world is doomed; we may as well accept it. But what I am at is that Abraham went to the very spot where God had spoken to him; that is to say, the place of his nearness to God, the place of dignity too, the dignity of God having spoken to him about the matter. It was from there that he looked toward Sodom. Abraham recognised the place. I have no doubt he would often think of that spot, the very spot where Jehovah had spoken to him. It is well to keep in mind where Jehovah speaks. Where does He speak today? Hs speaks in the assembly. That is where His communications are made, in the temple. Paul says, "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?", @1 Corinthians 3: 16. That is where God speaks.
Well, that is the place to go to. Abraham went to the place where God spoke to him and saw the destruction of Sodom from that point. I do not believe we see anything aright save from that point. There we see things as God sees them. It was from there that Abraham saw the destruction of Sodom.
{149}
That is all I had to say, just to stress the thought of speaking in nearness, and in a certain place, and that we should have recourse to that place so as to be in the mind of God and get the gain of divine speakings.
{150}
SPEAKING TO GOD IN SECRET
No one will ever understand speaking to God in the assembly until he understands speaking to God in his closet. I believe the closet is less understood than the holiest, at least mentally. The first thing is the closet, that is to say, the door shut to all others save God and yourself; you speak to God in secret. No doubt Moses had been accustomed to do that; he could never have become the man he was in the service of God had he not been accustomed to speak to God in secret. His brother Aaron too could never have had the place he had as priest in Israel save that he had been accustomed to speak to God in secret. God says, "I know him", one of the finest things that could be said of any of us by God. If any man love God the same is known of God, and we become known to God as we, as it were, knock at His door. As we seek access, He opens it; the door is opened, as I have been saying, and as you enter your closet and shut your door and turn to God in the light in which He has drawn near to you in your circumstances; you will soon find the holiest, and you will soon find that your closet has become the holiest. The holiest is the presence of God, but in Jesus; it is what Jesus is before God. It is as if God would say to you, 'These are the things that engage Me, and Christ is the centre', and you take a place there. You are not the centre; the more you draw near, the more you see that Christ is the centre and all around is holy. Like the holy vessels of the sanctuary, all were anointed and all were in perfect keeping within; they stood in relation to the ark. So that it was no new thing for Moses to speak to God; he was accustomed to do it. Nor can any serve God or be honoured of God save one who speaks to Him, who makes everything a matter of speaking to God.
{151}
GOD, COME DOWN
@Genesis 11: 5 - 8; @Genesis 18: 20, 21; @Exodus 3: 7, 8
The link in these scriptures lies in the thought that God *coming down* is in each. In the first and second, He comes down judicially, and in the third He comes down in mercy to deliver. That God should come down judicially is right in the eyes of all who think for God, whose consciences have become affected by the knowledge of God, who have not elected to exclude God from their knowledge. The fact that He comes in judicially is not against man. Law and justice are not against man, but when we think of God as the Executor of justice, we readily see that it is for us. And so, whilst the Babel builders may have complained that it was inconvenient to be unable to understand one another, yet this apparent inconvenience had in mind that man, segregated into families and nations, should be reserved in these limitations so that God might visit them in grace. Now, that is not against us. On the contrary it is in our favour, however inconveniencing it may have been. God has segregated the human family into subdivisions and has visited these subdivisions in time with the gospel. It was in mercy that God came in at Babel. It was extremely considerate of God to act thus. If the President of this country were to say, I am going from Washington to New York to see exactly what the trouble is there, that would be consideration, surely, on his part. How much more so with God! He came down at Shinar. It is not that He needed to come down to gauge exactly what was current there. He knew perfectly what was current there. But He would give man to understand that He is exceedingly fair. He would come to our way of thinking and would give us severally to understand that it is not beyond Him to come into each one's circumstances. He does it.
{152}
The Lord Jesus came down from heaven to one man outside the gates of Damascus. He could have converted Saul of Tarsus without coming down. He has converted millions without coming down, but He came down to meet that man. It is recorded to convey to us that it is not out of keeping with the present position of the Lord Jesus to come into any of our circumstances. Later, Paul tells us that the Lord stood by him and strengthened him. So that whilst God may come near to act judicially, and to see how things are with us, He also comes near to us in grace -- like the Samaritan who came where the man was who had fallen among thieves. And it is not too much to say that the Lord of glory may come into this room to have to do with some of us who are here. He has His own way of doing it, and we expect Him to come in order to find an inlet into hearts. He is here for you!
Now in the first of these scriptures the name 'Jehovah' is used. That is the covenant God, the God who has entered into covenant and makes engagements. And He came down, according to chapter ii, to look at the world structurally. I suppose I could hardly refer to this subject in more suggestive surroundings. I am thinking of the great buildings around us here. This city is suggestive of the world in a structural sense as no other city is. It is famous for its buildings, it bridges, its subways and other structures which are representative of the great things that the children of men can do. Also, there are the great combinations of men, great monetary combinations, commercial combinations, political combinations and religious combinations. This city is representative of all these things in superlative degree. So that from our text it is apropos that I should apply this matter so that we should place ourselves, as it were, in the plains of Shinar, where Jehovah came down to see what the sons of men
{153}
were doing. And has He not come to New York? He has indeed! He has come down to survey what the sons of men are doing in this very city, which is a most conglomerate combination of the human race, representing, I may say, all the families that were scattered at Babel. God has followed us here. His eye watched the craft that carried Columbus to this great continent, and the thousands of craft that have brought myriads of people to these shores since.
Not one of them has been lost sight of by God. This great continent has been opened up in mercy for His creatures, to provide for the overflow of the Old World. God is a faithful Creator, not only to His children, but to all men and tribes and nations. We all live and move and have our being in God. He provides for and preserves all men, especially those who believe.
In the next scripture the Spirit of God pictures Jehovah walking along the countryside with the great patriarch Abraham, as if they were two men walking together. There was Jehovah and two angels and Abraham. Just picture such persons walking across the countryside! Where were they going? They were going in the direction of Sodom. I have spoken of New York representing the world structurally, but there are other terrible features attaching to this city. The wicked features of Sodom are attached to this city also. A certain city is spoken of in the book of Revelation as being "spiritually Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified". Is New York exempt from this? No, sad to say, the great cities of this world are rather representative of it. Sodom represents the wicked side of the world. And who of us has not had to do with that? having our part in building it up? Who of us is not honest enough to admit that? The scripture says, "All have sinned".
The sinners belong to Sodom, in principle. But it is most interesting to picture Jehovah and Abraham and
{154}
the two angels there in the vicinity of Sodom. It is said to be the vicinity of the Dead Sea now. Abraham did not live in Sodom; he lived in the plains of Mamre. And Jehovah and two angels came to visit him there, but now they are moving on toward Sodom. The Sodomites were sinners above all: the scripture says they "were wicked, and great sinners before Jehovah". Doubtless they were carrying on as usual. There was no diminution in their sin. Lot was there, sitting in the gate, but he could not alter the character of Sodom. Rather Sodom altered his character, alas! No christian can alter the conditions of this world. The Lord Jesus said, "Now is the judgment of this world". It is under judgment. Sodom's judgment had not been pronounced as yet when Jehovah came to visit Abraham. Abraham was a praying man. There are many like him. We have prayed about this meeting and about those who have come in. Prayer is a great matter, as we will see with Abraham. The two angels went on to Sodom, but Abraham drew near to Jehovah. The doom of Sodom was imminent, for that matter had to be settled; and it was settled. And the doom of this world is a settled matter. God waits in grace and long-suffering, but its doom is fixed! That day is on the calendar; God has appointed it. And when it comes, the Man whom men have despised and crucified will take the judge's bench and judge the world.
Well, it says that Abraham stood yet before Jehovah. How beautiful that is! Last night, at many meetings for prayer, many of the Lord's people stood before Jehovah and told Him about the world and about the need of men. And He has heard. He heard Abraham. Abraham began his prayer in a most priestly way, saying, "Wilt thou also cause the righteous to perish with the wicked?". And he goes on, "There are perhaps fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not forgive the place for the sake of the
{155}
fifty righteous that are therein? Far be it from thee to do so". God was delighted with that. What a matter it is to speak to God as a known God! And so he says, "Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?". Was not God pleased with that? He was, indeed! Abraham knew it was not like God to destroy the righteous with the wicked. God is not doing that; He is lengthening out this wonderful period of the gospel that no one need be destroyed. It is not His will that any should perish, but that all should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth. And to that end God is lengthening out this wonderful day, this acceptable year of the Lord, so that you may not cry, with others, "The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved".
Well, I do not proceed further with Abraham's prayer save to say that God hearkened to him while he brought his request down to ten. The nearer we get to God, the more urgent we are in our prayers. He asked that Sodom be spared for fifty at first, but that it may be spared for ten righteous at the end. He stopped at ten; God did not stop him. God waited till Abraham finished. And so God waits while His people pray. What a God He is! Sodom was destroyed, but it was because there were not ten righteous in it.
I hasten on to the third scripture because it speaks of God coming down in mercy. Luke tells us that as the Lord Jesus was born into this world in Bethlehem, there were certain shepherds caring for their flocks by night, and that the angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them. What a beautiful scene is depicted by the evangelical writer! And the angel said to the shepherds, "Behold, I announce to you glad tidings of great joy ... for today a Saviour has been born to you in David's city, who is Christ the Lord". No mere babe that! Avoid any such thought of His being a mere babe, or that
{156}
Jesus was a mere man, He is Christ the *Lord*. It was not that He was to be, or will be. He was the Lord, *then*-that holy Babe was the Lord. He was not yet anointed, but He was, personally, the Christ. He was and is a divine Person-He is God! And then they were told, "And this is the sign to you ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling-clothes, and lying in a manger". There was never such a Babe on earth as that! It was God come down-not judicially -- here in grace as a Babe. There is nothing to cause fear; it is God come down in grace. We are told that the grace of God which carries salvation for all men has appeared. It is for all men. But how has it appeared? It has appeared in Jesus! And then we are told that a multitude of the heavenly host was there. What a time it was! And they were saying, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good pleasure in men". Heaven came down to express its feelings about what had happened; that God had come down in Jesus, the Saviour. Can anyone do without a Saviour? The soul *needs* a Saviour. "Ye are saved by grace, through faith; and this not of yourselves; it is God's gift: not on the principle of works, that no one might boast".
Well, the passage in Exodus is the same idea as I have been expressing. Jehovah says, "I have seen assuredly the affliction of my people ... and their cry have I heard ... for I know their sorrows. And I am come down to deliver them". It all foreshadowed what would be accomplished through God coming down in grace in Jesus, through His death and the completion of the mighty work of redemption. It has all been accomplished and angels and principalities are now subject to Him. And the Holy Spirit is here, sent down from heaven. God has thus come down in Christ and in the Holy Spirit, the power of God to save. It is for every one. May God grant it.
{157}
CHRIST AS KNOWN IN THE ASSEMBLY IN THE WILDERNESS
@Acts 7: 37, 38; @Deuteronomy 9: 7 - 9, 18 - 29; @Deuteronomy 10: 1 - 11
J.T. Attention is called to Moses who, as it says, was in the assembly in the wilderness, and the thought is that we might dwell a little on that this afternoon not simply the wilderness as applying to each individual among the saints, but how we are to be in it collectively and how, according to this type, Christ is to be known in the assembly in the wilderness. He is to be known in the assembly in heaven: God and the Lamb are said to be there. How He is to be known in the wilderness in the assembly is perhaps a thought not much before us, but Stephen by the Spirit alludes to it; having spoken much of Moses, he refers to him, "This is the Moses", and then, "This is he who was in the assembly in the wilderness". That is, it is a matter of how He is to be apprehended in the local assembly and how He is to be apprehended in the assembly as a whole in its wilderness setting. Deuteronomy, I thought, especially in the verses read, opens up to us what Moses was himself. It is a retrospective view; the Spirit, through Moses, goes back on the history, calling attention to what the people were under the different circumstances mentioned and what he was amongst them. That was what I had in mind for our consideration.
E.S.H. The intercession of Moses on behalf of the people is very beautiful. Is that a suggestion of Christ in the assembly?
J.T. Yes. He is seen in an intercessory way, but he is also seen, as you might say, in an atoning way, throughout the book. God was not only angry with them, but He was angry with Moses. In Numbers He is angry with Moses because of Moses's own
{158}
conduct, but not so in Deuteronomy; there He is angry because of the conduct of the people; so Moses is viewed vicariously in Deuteronomy and also in an intercessory way. It is a great and wide subject in regard to Christ's atoning work, but what one would like to reach is its application in the principle of it now. How are we to get on without "this Moses"? We should be just tossed about as a ship without a rudder or compass is in the storm save as we have "this Moses" in the assembly in the wilderness, and save as things are in His hands. Moses never lets things go.
Rem. It is what Moses is personally.
J.T. Yes, Deuteronomy gives us the words of Moses in a certain position, and we have geography and time in this book. It says, "These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red Sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban ...", @Deuteronomy 1: 1. It is at the confines of Canaan and after the forty years in the wilderness, but still in the wilderness: he represents Christ in the wilderness, that is, in the place of contrariety. Stephen draws attention to him in the assembly in the wilderness; that is what I apprehend we might be profited by, to apprehend what He is in the wilderness.
E.S.H. Is intercession based on atonement having been made?
J.T. I think the fact brings out the exigencies of the position. Atonement was made typically in Egypt, but its application is acquired in the wilderness in that Jehovah was angry with Moses on their account.
Moses has to stand in the breach. There is constant occasion for anger, for, after all, "Our God is a consuming fire", but there is always Moses in the assembly standing in the breach.
Ques. Have you in mind that matters of administration and discipline cannot be rightly carried out unless we recognise Moses in the wilderness?
{159}
J.T. I thought not, Moses in the assembly in the wilderness.
Ques. Would it work out in the spirit of Christ as those who are intelligent in the assembly are with the Lord in this way?
J.T. I think so. 1 Corinthians opens it up to us "When ye are gathered together", the apostle says, "and my spirit"-that was the kind of spirit that was needed to deal with evil. There was no compromise with Paul's spirit. But, "with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ"-I think that gives what is meant. The history from Exodus to Deuteronomy inclusive brings out what the people were, and Moses reminds them here of that. He says, "Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the Lord thy God to wrath in the wilderness".
Ques. What are we to understand by the wilderness here?
J.T. For our subject this afternoon, it began at Horeb; for the individual christian, it begins at the Red Sea as crossed. Horeb is where divine principles and requirements are formally introduced, that is where the conflict against the assembly begins properly; the assembly has the mind of God. The wilderness is the world, it is just where we have been in our unconverted days, the world of contrariety. That is, its principles are directly opposed to what is inaugurated at Horeb, or, as we may say, at Pentecost and in 1 Corinthians. It is a matter of the apostles teaching and fellowship, how the saints are to be maintained in such a contrary element. But this Moses is in the assembly in that position; not only has He received living oracles, as Stephen says, but He is there to enforce them. I think when Paul says, "With my spirit", he means that the spirit of authority must be there and there must be subjection if we are to get on, to prove what our Moses is to us in the assembly in the wilderness. In Hebrews He sings in the midst of
{160}
the assembly, "In the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises", the Lord says; that is not in the wilderness properly, that is in the land, but our subject now is the assembly in the wilderness and how we are to get on in the wilderness in assembly with our Moses.
Ques. Is that why Paul says, "I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud ... and were all baptised unto Moses", @1 Corinthians 10: 1, 2?
J.T. Yes, I think so; we are brought under his authority, and he manifestly had access later, at Horeb, to the holiest at all times. They were "living oracles", that is, immediate communications; immediate communications marked the whole wilderness period; hence the constant repetition of "Jehovah spoke to Moses saying ...". One can understand the freshness and power with which Moses would come out and speak the mind of God freshly received; but why should it not be so now? It is only a type of the present time, of the continued presence of the Lord in the assembly in the wilderness.
Rem. So that the mind of God is being made known in a fresh living way amongst the brethren in the assembly.
J.T. Quite so.
Ques. You referred to the anger of Jehovah being against Moses. What did you mean by that?
J.T. Well, the thought of the vicarious sufferings of Christ is brought in; the sufferings of Christ are not merely historical, they are ever present. How can God go on with us? It is only on that ground. Of course it is historical, but it is also a present thing, carried right through Deuteronomy, as you might say.
G.A.v.S. Is the assembly of God in the wilderness to be sustained by the sense, in its own practical experience, of how the Lord came into the conditions where He, having been tested and suffering in His
{161}
own spirit, constitutes an occasion and reason why the people of God are being carried through it?
J.T. Yes, He encountered the thing here where He asserted the will of God. He was here in holy submission and carried every thought of God through infinitely; and then He took full account of the broken law in Israel's history, as entering into death. It is thus following Him that we get the vicarious thought, the Sufferer, the sufferings of Christ as He vicariously came under wrath. Well, that is ever present, because the crooked ways of Israel in the wilderness are but a type of our own, of what is current; the sense of the vicarious sufferings of Christ is to be ever present with us. I do not think we get a true judgment of things otherwise.
Ques. Is the assembly rightly held together on that principle?
J.T. I think so. There was present in Israel in the assembly in the wilderness a man who had endured divine wrath, in his measure. Typically it is Christ He was "angry with me". And this man who is speaking is in their midst. The sense of it is there.
Ques. Should the thought of "The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin" (@1 John 1: 7), be ever present with us?
J.T. Quite; the sense of what God is as against sin is never to be absent from us in wilderness conditions. So that he says here, "Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the Lord thy God to wrath in the wilderness; from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the Lord. Also in Horeb ye provoked the Lord to wrath, so that the Lord was angry with you to have destroyed you. When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the Lord made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread
{162}
nor drink water". He brings forward what he endured; it is the presence of this man that keeps things alive, that keeps the right feelings present as to what was due to God. That is what is needed in every locality, to feel things with God.
Ques. And to have these feelings in a suffering spirit, would you say?
J.T. Exactly, that is the point.
Ques. Would you say the features that shone out in Moses should be seen amongst the saints?
J.T. That is what I thought we might reach. Paul says, "When ye are gathered together, and my spirit", that kind of spirit, the spirit of authority, yet the spirit that feels things with God.
Rem. In reading Moses we realise he had feelings with God against evil.
J.T. That is exactly what comes out. He speaks of not eating for forty days and hungering and of falling down before Jehovah. Well, it is the present Moses who is talking, not an historic Moses merely; it is Christ present in this way. How can we maintain discipline otherwise? I thought we might see in chapter 10 how, with all this, terrible as the conditions were, Israel journeyed spiritually. In the parenthesis, that is, verses 6, 7, "The children of Israel took their journey ... there Aaron died, and ... Eleazar his son ministered ... in his stead". And "from thence they journeyed ...", until they came to a land of waterbrooks; that is, I think, dear brethren, what is so beautiful and precious, that is, there is positive movement in presence of all this lawless conduct. And how important the maintenance of discipline and holy order is so that we might reach the land of waterbrooks and come in for the guidance of another Priest, that is, Christ in another way in relation to heaven. Why should there be that parenthesis? It is thirty-eight years historically after what Moses was speaking about-why should it be there? It is to encourage
{163}
us in our maintenance of discipline as to what may be reached through it. The Israel of God is there, and God comes in for His portion, a Levite that He can recognise, and He takes up Levi for His inheritance at this point. So we have a dual state of things: the internal condition of things, and what God can delight in through our heavenly Priest, that is Eleazar.
Ques. Would the land of water-brooks indicate the Spirit Himself active in ministry to the conditions of the people after they had faced the discipline of the wilderness?
J.T. That is precisely, I think, what is meant. We come in for positive ministry in movement in the Israel of God in the midst of all these things. It is to encourage the maintenance of discipline and divine order. You can see how Moses is being honoured in this wonderful spirit of intercessory love for the people that they might be preserved. You can see how God honours a man who comes forward and takes up matters and places himself in the front in suffering, accepting responsibility.
G.A.v.S. Would you say it was really the intensity of Moses's affection for the people that led him to go so specifically through the rebellions of the people, and,. having thus exposed them, bring them to the recognition of that, on the one hand, and the reception of the ministry in the power of the Spirit, on the other hand?
J.T. You can see how that works out practically in our meetings when discipline is maintained; as the apostle said, "My spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ". What ministry you get, refreshing things! and we are led into the land of the waterbrooks, which is, of course, Canaan in principle, though still the wilderness position; it is one of the features of Canaan. So I think Moses is honoured in this chapter in that God says, "Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first", as though it is the Lord's
{164}
matter now. We come to apprehend how the Father has given all things into the hands of the Son, and we are well off, for it is at this juncture, according to Exodus, that Moses comes down with his face shining; it is the principle of the new covenant.
Ques. Would that answer to @2 Corinthians 3? The covenant is referred to, and then it says, "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty".
J.T. I think so. That is what 2 Corinthians brings out, the liberty of the Spirit; it is through maintaining order and discipline. When the ark came to rest it is emphasised that there is nothing in it but the two tables of the covenant that Jehovah gave at Horeb.
Ques. Would you say that the spirit of suffering that the Lord gave to Moses was a necessary accompaniment of the wilderness position if the two tables were to be carried all the way through in the sense of what God gave at Horeb?
J.T. I should think so, the spirit of the vicarious Sufferer. No one felt things as Moses did; he was a type of Christ personally. The point, I think, in our localities is being in accord with that, feeling things, and taking them on in relation to the gathering; and I think then God comes in, things are dealt with, and there is a refreshing ministry. Discipline is maintained in the assembly; were it not, there would always be a drag, perhaps the mere repetition of things; but we want water-brooks.
Ques. What would you say the discipline is?
J.T. Well, dealing with evil. We are all under discipline personally, the Father disciplines us severally; but what we are dealing with now is Christ, our Moses, in the wilderness, and what is maintained collectively. The more we are with God the more discipline there will be, because we shall not be afraid to speak to one another. The deeper the love, the greater the knowledge of God in the covenant, the more readiness there will be to discipline one
{165}
another, and then, if it be necessary, to exercise collective discipline, and to exercise it in a dignified way.
Ques. Will you explain discipline in the assembly, and the other kind of discipline?
J.T. Well, each one who is with God has a judgment about every brother he knows; I have a judgment about every brother I know. I am sure Moses had; he knew the elders of Israel well, he had a wide acquaintance with Israel in the wilderness and he had a judgment about them. Well, my relations with that brother would be according to my judgment about him, and that is an advantage to me if I am a spiritual man. My relations with him, my attitude towards him, will be governed by my judgment about him.
Ques. Elders who had experience with God and exercised rule were to be found in every city. Would it come in in that way?
J.T. It works out that way no doubt, but we have a judgment about one another. Think of @Romans 16; what a judgment the apostle had about the brethren at Rome as we see in his salutations. His judgment was of their good qualities; that is all he mentions. But were you to ask Paul about Phoebe, for instance, 'Why are you speaking so well about her?', he would say, 'Well, I know her; she is in the church at Cenchrea, which is only a short distance from Corinth where I was for some months, and I acquired a high estimate of her'. Well, that is the basis of his commendation of her. And so throughout the list. He might have told you many things about this and that one: 'There are things I have serious concern about, but I have them in mind. I have had relations with this and that one'. If any of us come in for assembly discipline, then it is a question of the whole assembly, because, when Achan was stoned, *Israel* was to stone him, not the elders only; the whole assembly is to
{166}
execute the judgment, and each one ought to have a knowledge of the person.
Ques. Would not that principle enter into giving letters of commendation?
J.T. I thought so. What remarkable knowledge the apostle had of the different persons when he wrote to Rome; and were he to write to other companies, I suppose it would have been in the same way.
Ques. There is a character of discipline that does not go so far as stoning; would you say a word about that?
J.T. Yes; but I think we ought to get clear about this matter of eldership, that is, whilst the younger, and necessarily the sisters, do not take part in the proceedings, they are in the thing; they have a judgment, or they are of no value whatever in the administration: unless we have a judgment we are of no moral value in the administration.
G.A.v.S. Is having a judgment of persons or things a part of the education towards eldership?
J.T. I think it is. How beautifully the neighbours of Naomi, for instance, spoke to her. They knew about her and about Boaz and Ruth; they knew Naomi, she was an old resident in the place: she is thoroughly in fellowship now, and they are altogether with her in the blessing of God. I think that is the way matters should stand; we know each other.
Ques. Is that the attitude of John when he addressed his second and third epistles to the elect lady and to Gaius? He addresses them both as elders; he had a judgment about the conditions in the two places, had he not?
J.T. That brings out what we are saying, that a sister may have part in the administration of discipline.
Ques. Was not Israel's stoning of Achan the outcome of what they had received through Moses as to
{167}
the mind of God? Is that where the eldership comes in?
J.T. Quite so; the elders come into the knowledge of things through experience. The qualifications of an elder are generally moral. In the first epistle to Timothy and in that to Titus elders were to be appointed, but in @Acts 20, they are made by the Holy Spirit. That implies first-hand knowledge definitely of the person; they are qualified. It is not merely a matter of years, but of moral qualifications, and the thing should come out in them formally, but then they are not the only ones who cast a stone.
Ques. @Psalm 19 speaks of the judgments of the Lord as being "true and righteous altogether". Would that characterise the judgment in a local assembly?
J.T. Exactly. The Lord said, "Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment", @John 7: 24. If I am to cast a stone, I ought to have a judgment of the person and of the guilt.
Ques. You mean instruction in what is pleasing to God?
J.T. Yes. What is the discipline? and what is it for? what are the principles governing it? Each case of discipline ought to leave its results in education. I believe that is how eldership is promoted.
Ques. It says in connection with the sin of Achan that "Israel has sinned"; has that any bearing on the matter?
J.T. That is another side. It is the obligation of each of us, for the matter has taken place in the midst. The onus is on the company, and we can only clear ourselves by the execution of discipline.
Ques. In the case of Achan, there was no confusion in relation to it; why is there often confusion with us in regard to these matters?
J.T. A meeting for discipline very often takes on the character of a meeting for deliberation. It is not an occasion for deliberation at all; it is for the
{168}
pronouncement of the judgment of the Lord in the assembly. It is not a time for hearing evidence; it is a call for a spiritual, dignified announcement of the evil, the discipline that has to be executed.
Ques. Judgment is that which is come to in the assembly meeting; is it reached there?
J.T. The matter has been diligently enquired into by the brethren in care; a so-called care meeting cannot reach conclusions, the conclusion is in assembly.
Ques. But nevertheless you would go from the care meeting with a judgment arrived at in order that there might be the execution of judgment in the assembly?
J.T. Well, there can be no judgment arrived at in care other than what is tentative; administration belongs to the assembly only.
Rem. Judgment cannot have a collective effect apart from the assembly, but in the care meeting individual judgments are found to be more or less in accord.
J.T. Yes, we reach a judgment tentatively, but our Moses is with us in the assembly in the wilderness, that is, where the saints are convened for discipline and the like. "Where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them", I think would apply.
Ques. Would not the matter of confusion that was referred to be due to a very large extent to the lack of an individual apprehension of the real character of things as detailed by Moses as he recited it to them in the wilderness?
J.T. We see very plainly his own feelings about this; but it is a mischievous thing amongst us to assume that the brethren in care administer decisions reached. The Lord does not like that; it is not our Moses in the assembly in the wilderness.
Rem. The Lord is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints.
{169}
J.T. Just so.
Ques. Should the accused person be present when the matter is taken up?
J.T. Certainly; if he can be induced to be there he should be there.
Ques. And you would not get a judgment till he has given an answer or replied to the accusation?
J.T. I do not think there is any need for that. That raises another question, as to the priestly character of the brethren. The judgment of the assembly does not hinge on anything he might say; the brethren are acting with a perfect knowledge of things. It is not a court of deliberative judgment; that leads up to it; it is simply for the pronouncement of the judgment of the assembly; it is no place for deliberation. It is a dishonour to the Lord to have discussion of pros and cons when the assembly is convened for the administration of discipline. It is not a deliberative court where we have the witnesses, and the case is gone into. The apostles and elders, it says, came together to enquire into the matter, they reached a judgment, and it was ratified. "It has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us" (@Acts 15: 28): to the assembly, that is final. @1 Corinthians 5 is a brief statement of the case; it is brief 'The case being such as it is, I have delivered such an one unto Satan; there are no witnesses to call; the matter is settled'.
Rem. The apostle, in that way, has a judgment, but he links himself with the saints in pronouncing it.
J.T. Just so.
Rem. A sense of the vicarious sufferings of Christ would enable us to handle these matters rightly.
J.T. That is the reason why I think we should pay attention to Moses's remarks about himself. If we have not a sense of the vicarious sufferings of Christ, I do not think we are qualified to exercise discipline.
{170}
Ques. Do you look upon the assembly as being an executive body in this matter of discipline?
J.T. That is right; the deliberations are all tentative. The Lord is in the assembly to convey His thought of it; our Moses is always with us in that sense; He is there with us to convey His thoughts.
Rem. That means you would not, as a matter of practice, have a meeting of that kind until all the deliberations were clear.
J.T. Quite so. That would rest on the priestly character of the brethren; the saints as a whole, sisters and all, have confidence in the brethren in the exercise of priesthood; they are to be relied on; heaven relies on them: "Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them". Heaven has confidence in us in that light, so should all the sisters have too; but nevertheless there is that which the Lord so values in an administrative body here in carrying out the will of heaven that it should be carried out in a dignified way. Dignity attaches to the assembly as having the anointing.
Ques. You would regard Christ, who is spoken of so many times in Corinthians as the Lord, as being parallel with the suggestion of Moses in these scriptures?
J.T. That is what I thought, exactly.
Ques. I suppose it is important that if the assembly comes to a judgment, it is binding, even if we are not clear about it.
J.T. Yes, and if I am not with the brethren in it, it is a question of where I am spiritually. Why am I not with my brethren?
Ques. Would you say that what led Moses to take up these thoughts was that he saw the people in relation to God? He could say to them, "Ye are my people", so he could form a judgment of the people as God would look at them.
{171}
J.T. Yes. I thought at the outset we are in danger of losing sight of the great gain of this movement of Israel as a thing concurrent with the exercise of discipline; this parenthesis (verses 6, 7) shows the gain there is and the incentive to maintain discipline, because why else should it be brought in here?
Ques. Why is the death of Aaron brought in in that connection?
J.T. I think it contemplates that the brethren are coming to see Christ in His heavenly relations in the assembly. It is another Priest, what He is in the wilderness, entering into all these things with us. Moses is said to have married a Cushite or an Ethiopian; the Lord continued His marital relations with us notwithstanding the ugliness that comes out; He maintains His relations with us. But then there are the inner relations that are not ugly, but very beautiful; what He can see abstractly in His church, He can identify Himself with unreservedly and lead the true assembly spiritually into that land of water-brooks. It is Christ in another way, as the One who sings in the midst of the assembly, but it is brought in there, I think, to encourage us to maintain discipline, for as we maintain it we come into this.
F.I. There can be no movement apart from discipline.
J.T. I think that is right. It says, "The children of Israel took their journey"-they are able to journey-"from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera; there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's *office* in his stead. From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters". And then it says, "At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day. Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance
{172}
with his brethren; the Lord is his inheritance". I think all that is beautiful as the heavenly side of things, what we come into, and what we are in measure, I am sure, coming into; but we cannot come into it aside from discipline and the judgment that these chapters assert.
Ques. Does Eleazar represent the service of Christ in assembly privilege?
J.T. That is as I understand it. It is more @Hebrews 2, Christ singing in the midst of the assembly. It seems very encouraging that, in spite of all that is current outwardly, there is this inner state of things that the Lord is maintaining. Then another thing that comes out is that God has His portion in spite of all these ugly things; He separated the tribe of Levi to bear the ark of the covenant. God is very particular; He separates this tribe so that the ark is carried; there are no irregularities at all. Levi represents spiritual intelligence amongst us: "To bear the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, to stand before Jehovah to do service unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day. Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brethren; Jehovah is his inheritance"; that is, they are a heavenly people, it is the heavenly side of the truth that comes in here.
Rem. And it is absolutely necessary that that principle of separation is established in the hearts of the people of God before they are able to support what is in the heart of Christ down here.
J.T. Yes. The tribe of Levi is the heavenly side, according to Joshua and @Hebrews 12, "the assembly of the firstborn". What an exit that is from the public state of things contemplated in this chapter.
Rem. The change of priesthood makes the priestly service here on earth effective.
J.T. Quite so. I find in my little experience amongst the brethren that after a care meeting where matters have been gone into and dealt with, and
{173}
pronouncements reached in the assembly, there is usually more liberty in the Lord's day morning meeting. I think the Lord honours the taking a care of things, that they are not allowed to drag on, but are dealt with as they come up. God gets His part. Levi represents the saints viewed in their heavenly relations, the firstborn ones enregistered in heaven.
Ques. We have here the peculiar mention of the ark of wood linking with the closing words of Nehemiah with regard to the wood-offering.
J.T. It is a question of the kind of humanity, I think, the new order of man; Moses saw to that, that it was there; it is not a mere theory, 'It is there', he says; the ark is there in its proper setting.
Ques. Would the end of Matthew fit in with the thought of the Lord in the assembly in the wilderness, "Behold, I am with you all the days"?
J.T. That is it: "All the days", every day of the week there. When the brethren come together to see that things are adjusted properly, I believe the Lord always honours us and we reach the land of waterbrooks.
Ques. Did not great prosperity follow Peter's taking up things in @Acts 5?
J.T. That is an illustration of it.
Ques. Should the judgment arrived at in an assembly meeting be announced to the saints gathered on the Lord's day morning?
J.T. What need is there for it, if the assembly is the assembly?
Rem. Some have thought that perhaps because publicity has been given to the evil, publicity should be given to the announcement that such a person is no longer walking with us.
J.T. I do not think we should publish evil, or that the world is entitled to any knowledge of what goes on amongst us. Suffice it that the saints have a
{174}
knowledge of what has been done, that they have a judgment about it.
Ques. Should the one being dealt with be notified?
J.T. He ought to be there; if he is at all an honest man he would be there; certainly he should know what the judgment of the assembly is.
{175}
WOMEN OF WORTH
@Matthew 28: 5, 6; @2 Kings 4: 18 - 24, 30 - 37
These scriptures, as you will readily notice, concern sisters in the Lord; they concern them greatly, but they concern all, in view of the significance of the feminine element; that is, it refers to what is effected in us by the Spirit of God; if it be in a bad sense, it refers to what is effected by the spirit of the world.
The book of Proverbs contemplates both these features, it contemplates the wise woman and the foolish, it contemplates the woman of worth. It is in this latter sense that I would treat these scriptures, as referring to the married woman of worth, according to the end of the book of Proverbs. It is a matter of great importance that there is that in this world, heaven looking down cognisant of their worth indicated, the opposite of which is a deep ditch, as Proverbs teaches us, of wickedness. Regarding this woman of worth, or virtue, as implying the assembly, the matter becomes of the very greatest significance as to the circumstances under which this formation and development or growth, proceeds; that is, there is what is objective, for God works in us according to what He presents to us. The passage in Matthew is significant as in that gospel. The objective side in chapters 27 and 28 is of the most solemn and searching nature; nothing could be more solemn and more searching, more subduing, than the objective facts presented to us in those chapters. @Matthew 27 has, at the close of it, certain groups. The great objective fact is the Lord Jesus, the Lord of glory, crucified-the *Lord of glory* that *He* should be seen in the most ignominious position, marked by the most excruciating sufferings, inclusive of that one great occasion of suffering, the forsaking of God, transcending all else, calculated to
{176}
affect every intelligence in the whole universe. But there were certain groups, I think: the first, a jeering group; the second, a believing group, persons who were affected at the moment who had not hitherto been affected; the third, a group of women, "many women" standing afar off from the cross, but standing in relation to it: He who hung there was supremely their object. John says they were standing by it; Matthew says many of them that had come from Galilee were beholding from afar off, they had been accustomed to minister to Him who hung there of their substance. Then, in the close of the chapter, we have one man, a rich man, burying the body of the Lord. So that you can see, dear brethren, what groups there are at that solemn moment in relation to that cross. These women are most interesting, not only on their own account, but on account of whom they represent; they were to become, at least in principle, the great maternal element in the structure that was about to be reared up by the Spirit of God, by the Lord, by God Himself. They were to represent that in its maternal instincts and feelings and affections; these were to be begotten in the presence of the most momentous occurrence in all history, in all time, in all eternity; they were to be affected and the formation was to be in accord with what was presented to them objectively; they were, as it were, begotten spiritually by the elements presented to them. There were no such women, no such persons, in history as these. The Marys were all there, that is, those who understood suffering, bitterness. John would tell us there were three Marys there, as far as I read; and Matthew says there was the Magdalene there and the other Mary, as if there were just two outstanding Marys. Now these are the ones, dear brethren, and the angel, representative of heaven, knew all about these women. The communications of angels to women in the Scriptures form in themselves a subject
{177}
of the deepest interest, direct communications of angels to women. I believe all of them have in mind what I am speaking about, the formation of that side that endures, that goes through all circumstances out of affection. A Ruth, for instance, would not be turned aside, she would go through the full way, the whole way, of love. And so all culminates, I believe, in these women, these Marys. The name, I believe, arises at the Red Sea, the bitterness of death experienced, the waters of death round; these are the ones, the church is formed, fashioned, in this way, she is to be the bride of the Sufferer, and the Lord is speaking to our hearts, dear brethren, at this present time, as to correspondence with Him in this respect. This Mary and the other. And now the angel, whose look caused terror in others, would occasion no terror in their hearts: he says to the women, "Fear not ye"-'I *know* what you seek'. How very touching and comforting that he knows, heaven knows-for that is the idea in the knowing-an angel conveys what is in heaven, heaven's thoughts. "I know", he says, 'what you seek', I *know*. Whatever others may think, how comforting that heaven knows what is in the depth of our hearts. He says, "I know that ye seek Jesus the crucified one". What was in their hearts was in correspondence with that, the crucified One. What an appeal that is as to what is going on in our hearts, as to what we seek. "I know that ye seek Jesus the crucified one"; there is no occasion for you to fear. And then he says, "Come, see the place where the Lord lay". That is what I want to direct your minds to, where He lay. Heaven is inviting them to see the place where He lay; this place is to enter into later instruction; it is of great spiritual significance, the place where the Lord lay. Were it known now, how sightseers from the ends of the earth would repair to it! The crucifixion has become an incident in human history; human history is not
{178}
fit for such a jewel. It would command the greatest interest from sightseers were it only known where the Lord lay. It is known to heaven, it is known in the heart of the church; it will not be sought there, the church in its true significance has no interest for the world. "Come, see the place where the Lord lay". They had come to see the sepulchre indeed, a poor thing in itself, but still, that was what they had come to see; but the angel said, 'I know what you seek. You seek not the sepulchre alone, you seek Him whom you think is there': but, he says, "Come, see the place where the Lord lay". That is the end for faith, that is the end of all the trouble, the vicarious burial of Christ. His burial was vicarious-why should He be there otherwise? "Where the Lord lay". Why should I look down to where He lay? His position there was vicarious, it was my place; the church understands; baptism places us there. "Identified with him in the likeness of his death" (@Romans 6: 5); that is not the position on the cross, it is the position in the grave. Not indeed that we are not crucified, for Paul says, "I am crucified with Christ" (@Galatians 2: 20); but where He lay is the end of all moral history here; I mean to say, it is the end of all the trouble. The church begins on that foundation, in one sense, and the understanding of it would be the end of all the trouble personally and collectively, locally and generally, amongst the saints. And so, dear brethren, one would invite you, as the angel did here, "Come, see the place where the Lord lay". It was the Lord of *glory*, but Matthew is concerned about authority; the *Lord* lay there; He is not there now, He is made Lord and Christ in heaven, but it is where He lay. And so these women form that element that goes through, that virtue that corresponds with Christ; they have gone to the bottom of things-that is the idea of the Son of God, the rock. But there is the termination of the moral element that causes the
{179}
trouble, the thing that causes the trouble. David was conversant with it; he was a son of peace indeed, but he, at one time, became a troubler of a most serious nature. We are all liable to that, the most spiritual. He lay on the earth while the child lived. That child represents the trouble. There was a dead Urias. Think of that, a devoted man, one of the mighties! Think of being the occasion of the death of Urias on the field, slain by the sword of the children of Ammon at the behest of David, the trouble-maker for the moment. The occasion of the trouble has to be dealt with and the child dies. 'The child is dead', says David, 'he will not return to me, I shall go to him. I go that way'. No doubt he had felt in his soul, 'I should have gone before him!', but he says, 'I go that way'. And Solomon is born, and he says,'Peace'; what a change from the trouble, the working of the flesh, of which we are all so capable! What a change! Immediately he says, "Solomon", meaning Peace now; the occasion of trouble is gone. That is what God is constantly, day in and day out, dealing with amongst us; He is dealing with the occasion of the trouble to make room for the Prince of Peace. How the Lord loves to come in in His Solomon character, how He loves to come in and say, "Peace be unto you"! 'See where He lay', the angel says: the vicarious death and burial of Christ is the termination of all the trouble for the glory of God, and these women saw that. Would that every one of us, every sister and every one of us, might see that. It is the great feature of things foundationally amongst us, how the trouble is dealt with; these women saw that place; they saw the darkness, they heard that loud cry, they saw the place where He lay, shown by heaven. We hardly ever see anything rightly except it is shown us: "Come, see the place where the Lord lay". But the Lord presently appears to them, as the chapter shows, but I do not go on to that. I am
{180}
speaking now of this important principle so essential to us in dealing with the occasion of the trouble, so that there shall be peace, the Prince of Peace. David says, "Solomon", God says, "Jedidiah", that is the beautiful thought of the Person of Christ apprehended in resurrection. Peace-Jehovah loved him-He would take us from the occasion of the trouble into a realm of peace and love. That is the realm proper to the assembly; the Lord says, "Peace be unto you", and it says, "Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord", a great matter. It is the service of Jesus to gladden our hearts. Much is on this line, dear brethren. The Lord gladdened their hearts and said "Peace" to them.
Well now, I want to show how the Old Testament exemplifies this in the history of this remarkable woman called the Shunammite. It is not now a question of a trouble-maker; Achan is the great troubler of Israel, he represents the trouble-maker, and all Israel had to say to him in the valley of Achor, but it becomes the door of hope. You see the process is going on, merging from sorrow to joy. This boy, or child, as he is called, is not an Achan, he is a Colossian believer, to be simple. The history of this chapter in 2 Kings embodies the truth of Romans in the paying of one's debt by the Spirit, and the truth of Colossians, seen, as I hope to show, in this child, and the truth of Ephesians in the man from Baal-shalishah. God studs the whole face of Scripture with His own thoughts, dear brethren, if we only have eyes to see what He sets down before us. One has been greatly struck lately with the thought of the land, how God stresses it from the very outset of its introduction after the flood, the land. The adjectives in the language are exhausted in the vocabulary of God to stress the richness and greatness and beauty of that land, to allure our hearts out of this world to the realm of His purpose, into a land of water-brooks,
{181}
deep water-springs and hills and valleys. The Spirit of God uses such descriptive words to lead beyond what Palestine ever could be or ever will be; it is just taken as a figure by the Spirit of God to lead our hearts into what is altogether beyond what any territory on earth could ever be, this spiritual realm that God would allure our hearts into, and the Scriptures are full of it. Colossians is not exactly the land; it is entering into it, it is a tentative epistle, if you understand. It is collective, but it is a tentative sort of position. You are going in, you may not go in, but you are just crossing over; it raises incentives presented objectively in Christ. "Seek the things which are above, where the Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God: have your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth; for ye have died, and your life is hid with the Christ in God. When the Christ is manifested who is our life, then shall ye also be manifested with him in glory". It is to draw us in, that is the thought of Colossians, and to adjust us according to God by the application of the death of Christ, the circumcision of Christ and the burial of Christ, in baptism. That is what Colossians is; it is, as I might say, where the Lord lay, it is the end of things here. "Buried with him in baptism, in which ye have been also raised with him through faith of the working of God who raised him from among the dead". Quickened with Him, too, out of death, made to live with Him. And so it is the closing of the door-that is the idea; @John 20 is the closing of the door and 2 Kings is the closing of the door. It is a secret matter, it is not exactly dealing with trouble-makers, but with the power of death working. It can only be cured in one way, by being brought into correspondence with Christ. It is no question of paying debts, beloved brethren; it is a question of a dead boy or a living boy. That is Colossians, and we see the agonies of Paul about the
{182}
Colossian saints. They were a very remarkable company, like Laodicea, which place Paul had apparently never visited, but he had agonised about the saints there. What is needed is that sort of thing, dear brethren, to get the saints into life by placing them where the Lord lay, so to speak. And so I would point out that this remarkable woman is equal to this experience. She was promised this boy, and she had him presented as the prophet says, "Thou shalt embrace a son"; he knew what that would mean to her heart, not simply 'You will have him', but, You will "embrace a son". A son is worth embracing; a woman is not worthy of the name of a mother if she does not embrace a child; it is the affections that are proper, and especially in a spiritual sense; to embrace is the expression of affection. "And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers. And he said unto his father, My head, my head". This boy is in a serious condition, it is a head condition. Young men and women should take notice of this, because our heads are very often much in advance of our feet; I know that well; each of us knows it. And the father's side could do nothing; he knew enough, however, to send the child back to the mother; he was promised to the mother, not to the father. What is to be done is to be done by her; it is all a question of the development of the truth. Here is a great woman, she is devoted to the testimony, what is to be done for her? Give her a son, she is to embrace a son; that is spiritually, dear brethren, the assembly; you can see the force of it, the supreme object of affection. But there is this trouble, and the father sends him to his mother by the hand of a lad-it is a youthful state of things-and the mother takes him on her knees and he dies at noon; when he should be in vigour, he dies; when we should hope, death comes in-these are sorrowful considerations! What exercises the people of God
{183}
have to go through, and where are we in regard of these exercises? The formation is in relation to these exercises, persons who have feelings, who go through things. Well, she knew what to do; and that is the point, dear brethren, that the mother knows what to do. It is a question of the local assembly knowing what to do. What am I going to do in this? It is not a matter to be dealt with in discipline, it is a question of a state; not conduct, but a state. Well, there is a man of God who has got a bed; it is where he lies, where he lay; he is not lying there now, he is in Carmel-a very different position, the place of fruitfulness, the place of victory, too, denoting the intelligence of heaven, for heaven is ready to intervene whatever it is. We are never pushed to a wall, heaven will come in. It is a good thing to turn our face to the wall, like Hezekiah, at times saying,'I can do nothing'; but heaven can do much. So she puts the child on the bed of the man of God; she laid him there. That is a very important reflection. "And she called unto her husband and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God". Her husband is a poor sort of man, he did not look after the reapers; it is the responsible element, very often extremely lacking, unable to do anything spiritually. And here this husband says, "It is neither new moon, nor sabbath"; he is a sort of ceremonialist, a man who observes certain things, very important in their way; the new moon, the recovery of Israel by-and-by; and the sabbath, a future thing. But it is a question of the present thing; what am I going to do now? What God will do in the future will involve the exercise of mighty power bringing a nation into power in a day and restoring everything: but here is a dead boy on whom the affections and the hopes of this dear woman were set, and her husband is talking about set feasts. Set feasts are valuable, of course (like this one) the
{184}
Lord specially works in them; but it is a question of every day, this happened "on a day", it says, on an ordinary day; what am I going to do? Well, there is a man of God; the hope of the universe, as it were, is here. We have been speaking about Moses; it is Moses that is talking. The man of God is not here where the child died, or perhaps the child would not have died. Well, he is in Carmel, he is reachable, and this man's foolish obstacles are just brushed aside. "She saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward". The man of God here drops below the level of Christ, for the Old Testament types do not always hold. He thinks Gehazi and his staff will do. No, the door is shut-it might as well have been shut to Gehazi, he did nothing, nor did the staff do anything. There was little link between Gehazi and the staff of the man of God; they are occupied with external things-spiritual men often drop to that too. But there was the mother of the child. The great thought in Scripture is that she is not going to leave; she has no confidence in that staff; such measures are not to be trusted; we want more than experience now; I have no doubt that is what the staff means. But this is a new matter, and the woman was above them all; she was more spiritual than any of them at the moment. She says to the man of God, "I will not leave thee". She would bring Christ in, and Elisha goes with her. "He went in therefore, and shut the door". I beg of you to notice this, dear brethren, shut the door; that is Colossians, corresponding with the raising up of Jairus's daughter. It is the elimination of what might, what would, hinder, and the retention only of what would help. It is a spiritual matter, and Elisha has to go through the thing too, for in these cases we, through the grace of God, are brought into correspondence with Christ, we are forced into correspondence with Christ; there is no way out of it otherwise. The Lord says, "I am
{185}
the way"; there is no other, and Elisha recognises this. He stretches himself on the boy; well, he becomes warm, that is something, a little bit of heat where there was coldness. Young men and young women often get away like this with their heads; and it is touch, direct touch, spiritual touch, that is needed. The man of God has to walk up and down the house; what kind of house is it? He can see all that is in the house, not only in the room. Maybe there are things there that have to be dealt with; but he walked up and down the house. Suppose his eye rested on a novel! There were certainly none in the room that he occupied, it was no lavishly-furnished room. Suppose his eye rested on any other thing that the enemy might have brought in that house! "He went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands"; how personal it is! He is brought into direct touch with Christ-the man of God is typically Christ. He is lying there in the place of death, as it were, and he is now concerned about the boy, "And the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes", and he delivered him to his mother. This is one of the most interesting incidents of the kind in Scripture, and it is needed every day amongst us. The Lord would give us understanding of this maternal formation and the instincts and the intelligence and decision, the knowing what to do, that belong to it and are not to be turned aside, even by a husband. It is not any particular day, it is "one of the days", and she is going to attend to it on that very day, and she does, and the end is reached. "Take up thy son", says the man of God, and she "took up her son, and went out". What would he have been to her!
That is all I had to say. I hope the Lord will use this line of thought as to local companies dealing with evil according to what is presented in the cross, where
{186}
the Lord lay, the termination of everything that causes the trouble; and that love would have a son to fill the house, not only a son living, but a son having died; not only a son given, but a son having entered into death and come out of it. The mother of the child took the boy and went out-she had got him.
May the Lord give us to understand. "Whoso is wise, let him observe these things, and let them understand the loving-kindnesses of Jehovah", @Psalm 107: 43.
{187}
HOLY BUOYANCY
@Psalm 108: 1 - 9
This psalm, as possibly some may be aware, is partly taken from the earlier @Psalm 57 and @Psalm 60, which are in the second book. They are historical psalms, in the sense that they bring into view certain circumstances in David's history in regard to his sufferings, lending great interest to them; for the sufferings of David thus foreshadowed the sufferings of Christ in which we are privileged to have part. The repetition of certain passages in the psalms would remind us of the resetting of precious stones; they shine, they retain their lustre in every setting, but especially in their final setting as in this last book of Psalms. They refer to fineness of thought, which should not be foreign to us as christians; indeed, as partaking of the heavenly calling, we are to "judge of and approve the things that are more excellent", to compare and define what is excellent and what is more excellent. The more excellent a thing is, the more it can be employed in testimony, whether it is by a christian, or in the Word itself.
The same excellence and variety seen here is found throughout the Scriptures, so that we may have the same thought in Romans or Colossians or Ephesians, but the setting is different in each epistle. Timothy was sent to Corinth to represent what was spiritual amongst persons who were far otherwise, and hence he is selected for a mission to Corinth, under circumstances of peculiar difficulty, not only for what he could say, but for what he was. Were we to see that man sitting in Corinth at the reading meeting, we should be affected by his whole deportment, how he would sit and how he would speak. And in the Lord's own service in the synagogue at Nazareth, the
{188}
Spirit dwells on His movements, His personal movements, then on His words, then on His mouth; the words He speaks are "gracious words". The same words, of course, would be gracious on the lips of the saints, but they are particularly so in connection with the lips of Christ: no setting could be greater than that. "His mouth is most sweet"; there is no mouth like it; the setting of the quotation from @Isaiah 61 in @Luke 4, is therefore unique.
So these sections of the Psalms set together here are to be considered as to what the setting signifies. It is the last book of the Psalms; a book full of jubilance, which, though having its own place in the testimony, is arrived at by the way of David's sufferings and rejection. This fifth book is full of buoyancy, spiritual buoyancy, ending up with Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah! So that praise is the leading thought of this book, and I believe what was included in the praise which accompanied the institution of the passover, and the inauguration of the Supper by the Lord, was taken out of this book. So while these earlier psalms have to be understood in their setting in relation to the sufferings of Christ, that is, the sufferings of David entering into them, it is not so here in @Psalm 108. The point is not suffering here, but the outcome of suffering; and so though the setting in the first place is in relation to the suffering, the jewel of praise retains its radiance and beauty in other settings. The outcome of sufferings, beloved brethren, will appear in eternity, not necessarily as connected with the sufferings, but as the product of the suffering. The lustre and value of the psalms is thus secured eternally.
So the psalmist here begins with the statement, "My heart is fixed, O God". We are often very vacillating, and in a sense nothing is more required than fixity with us, but when everything comes clearly into view as in relation to Christ, then you fix your
{189}
heart and say, "My heart is fixed, O God; I will sing, yea, I will sing psalms, even with my glory". This is, I think, what God is doing at the present time among many other things, He is bringing about fixity, steadfastness and stability in us. Aside from this the testimony in our hands must lose lustre at times, for we are liable to become discouraged, and dejection is a discredit to the position, but as we see all things clearly established in Christ, we are fixed. Clarity of view is one of the greatest things needed. Part of the Lord's great service in Matthew is to give His disciples clear perspective; He took them on high for that. On the level things were exceedingly weak, but He took them up and the perspective is clear, and *He* is the centre of the picture. You see Him impressing the principles of His kingdom in chapters 5, 6 and 7, the Lord standing out in great majesty, so that the disciples understood; and as they descend there is a certain fixity in their affections and in their minds, which is what the Lord intends.
So in this @Psalm 108, there is this fixity, as you will observe, not as in the earlier psalms where great need existed, but the heart being fixed, he says, "I will sing psalms, even with my glory. Awake lute and harp: I will wake the dawn". There is a great suggestion there of what can be brought about in great persons as the outcome of sufferings. It seems as if the psalmist had in mind that whatever the darkness of the night, he would be there in His praise with the awakening of the morning. That is pre-eminently seen in the Lord Jesus on the morning of the resurrection, and He will yet come out with healing in His wings in a coming day; but I refer to what is here, to show the great thought of His securing this praise for God; and surely great thoughts belong to us: no other family of any of the families of God should be more capable of great thoughts than the saints today! John would press that, the greatness of the saints, that
{190}
it needed the great persons to bring in the great thoughts of God. So here these thoughts are Godward, as if he would wake the dawn, the glorious morning with songs of jubilee; like the birds in nature who awake the dawn with their songs. How beautiful is this suggestion of life showing itself in this variety in the praises of the believer in the dawn of the morning! How suggestive all this is! How stimulating to our hearts! Lest we should be looking to the west and the setting sun, instead of to the east and the sunrising. When the church comes into view we look towards the east! The tabernacle looked toward the east.
We have suggestions in some of the psalms of David as to what he would do. His influence extends, as the influence of the christian is extending, but his thought is not to exalt himself, but to exalt God. God gave him victory among the nations by which he secured right of way for his brethren, but in it all his desire was not to make himself great, though it did make him great, but to exalt God. God does widen our influence if we are faithful, but the thought here is to celebrate God in the saints. So he says, "I will give thee thanks among the peoples, O Jehovah; of thee will I sing psalms among the nations: for thy lovingkindness is great above the heavens, and thy truth is unto the clouds. Be thou exalted above the heavens, O God, and thy glory above all the earth. That thy beloved ones may be delivered". Now, dear brethren, this is a very important matter, for there are so many needing deliverance; the enemy is attacking in various places amongst us, holding people in bondage, hence the need of deliverance for hundreds of our brethren. How can we deliver them except in buoyancy, spiritual buoyancy? As it says, "That thy beloved ones may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer me". We see the exalted feelings of the psalmist, dear brethren, "Be thou exalted above the heavens". God
{191}
loves that thought! Jesus has gone beyond all that, "ascended up above all the heavens", but faith loves to see Him there, exalted above the heavens, for the service of man. So that there are results from the glory on high for the deliverance of the brethren. They are all dear to Christ, "the Lord knows those that are his".
Then the following verses from verse 7, are what God says: "God hath spoken in his holiness". The point is to emphasise that the speaking is in holiness; I speak now of what is unfolded in these verses, that is, God coming in and asserting His rights. There are different international settings among men which are always difficult, because it is all a question of man's selfish will. The believer learns that they have to surmount their selfish interests, that there is such a thing as superiority to international considerations; but that is "not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith Jehovah of hosts". The mountain may seem insuperable; it may indeed be called "great", but God says, "Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou dost become a plain". That is, nothing is impossible as we recognise the rights of God in Christ; everything gives way before the power of the Spirit. So that in our service we can look north, south, east and west, and the Lord has right of way everywhere. That is, dear brethren, the testimony is secured; the affections of the saints are widening and becoming universal instead of national. "The eyes of Jehovah run to and fro through the whole earth"; He is Lord of all the earth, and He asserts His rights; He has right of way there-a very great fact.
So here we find God speaking in His holiness and saying, "I will exult, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth" (verse 7). It is the blessed God full of holy buoyancy in what He is doing. He has got the right to man, and He exerts that right with joy; He rejoices over His saints with joy: as it says
{192}
elsewhere, "He will rest in his love; he will exult over thee with singing". He is full of exuberance, and we, as it were, enter into His enjoyment. What He says is, "Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine". That is God speaking, that is what He says in His holiness; He is in perfect consonance with the psalmist. It shows how God comes in and identifies Himself with us, that is victory indeed for those who serve, to see that God is working. So He says, "I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth", no one can stand in My way! Can anyone say to Him, This is my territory? Presently the Lord Jesus will come down from heaven, as a mighty angel, and will set His foot upon the sea, and His left foot on the earth, and who can say Him nay? Shechem and Succoth? He has rights there. However difficult the position, He has got rights there: "Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine, and Ephraim is the strength of my head"; it is as if God would allude to the wisdom of His people, they are "the strength of my head". He has got that; He has got something here, and we want to be in that to which He alludes here, whether it be Gilead or Manasseh or Ephraim. They all belong to God who is exalted above the heavens; that is elevation, and He speaks in holiness. Then He says also that He has got a lawgiver, that is Judah.
Then finally, He has a "wash-pot" in a place of reproach, that is Moab, but it is useful. It is not what we might call a refined thought, but it is very necessary. We all know what Moab stands for: "We have heard of the arrogance of Moab-he is very proud", but God may use even an abominable element like pride for our purification; He can turn it into a wash-pot, a means of purification. And then, "Upon Edom will I cast my sandal", as if He could do anything with that. Edom is the haughty brother, but who can say nay to what God does? And so, "Over Philistia will I shout aloud"; that speaks of the great
{193}
leaders in christendom today. So that the psalms are full of holy experiences for us, and God joins Himself to these experiences of His saints and gives effect to them. If David's influence is extending, God says, 'I will give effect to it too: I will give the same kind of victory'. "My grace suffices thee".
{194}
SYMPATHY WITH THE DIVINE CURRENT
@Acts 9: 3 - 5, 32 - 42
I had in mind to show how the work of God moves with the light, and how what is spoken on God's part at any given time affects those who are with Him in any measure, particularly now those who minister.
They should be the first to sense the divine movement, they should not be behind; at least they should, like Jacob, observe what may come to their ears. Jacob, you will remember, observed the saying of Joseph.
Joseph had dreamed about his brethren, symbolised in their sheaves; as his stood up, theirs stood round.
They did not like that; those whom the sheaves represent did not like to be eclipsed; they did not like to be outrun, to take the second place. But, in the wisdom of God, we may have to take the second place, or the third, or the fourth, or the eleventh, or the twelfth, and occupy it happily. Elisha, we are told, was ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth; there was no evidence of complaint in that. There could be no doubt that his furrows were equal to those of any of the others.
Then Joseph dreamed of the sun, moon and eleven stars bowing down to him. That was more difficult, and even drew out his father's disapproval, though not exactly his opposition. The brothers of Joseph, other than Benjamin, who is always the overcomer (a most important man to keep your eye upon, a man who can hold aloof from partisan activity, for partisan activity even formed against what is wrong is wrong itself, but if formed against what is right, how much worse!) the ten brothers of Joseph were partisan against him.
Their ire was aroused, for his dream about them was true; they had to come to that. It is better to come to things at once than to defer. Joseph dreamed about
{195}
heavenly things, and spoke his dream, and drew out the disapproval of one who loved him; for Jacob loved Joseph. We need not have much fear about the disapproval of one who loves us, even if his disapproval may not be well founded; he will come round, for love never fails, and love according to God is a stranger in a party; it has no part there, in fact. But his father observed the saying; and that, dear brethren, is what saves us-to observe what is said. It is worth thinking over; God will help you, and we are enjoined to prove all things and hold fast what is good. God gives us ability by the Spirit to discern, and it is well to observe the sayings and try them: "Doth not the ear", it says, "try words?". After all, there may be something worth observing.
Now I speak thus because of Peter's part at the end of this chapter. He represents the ministers; he is, indeed, the leading minister in relation to the twelve, and what comes out is that he senses, so to speak, what the current is, what has come in. Something had come in, and that a long way off; why should not the new thing come in at Jerusalem? It was at Damascus, a city that had no claim on Jerusalem; really it was an ancient rival, we may say. It was a long way off; faith had made the journey before, Abraham made it from Hebron to save his brother, and he succeeded. So that what enters into this period is a matter of distances. The apostle Paul later speaks of these distances, saying that he from Jerusalem and round about Illyricum had fully preached the gospel of Christ. He knew what journeys meant and did not hesitate to make them, certainly not from religious prejudice. To hesitate to visit a district from religious prejudice is foreign to the spirit of Christianity. But religious prejudice existed, and existed strongly in Jerusalem, and God was breaking in on it. The scattering by persecution after the death of Stephen was an intimation of this. We are told
{196}
that the apostles remained in Jerusalem, and now in these circumstances the Lord moved out of heaven, as we might say, or in heaven, but in relation to a territory far away from Jerusalem, and in relation to one man, too. There was the light from heaven shining round about that man, and there was the voice calling him by name and questioning him. Think of heaven questioning a man as to what he was doing! Does heaven not need to question us, beloved, as to what we are doing? It is a challenge to every heart as to what I am doing.
The Lord says, "Why dost thou persecute me?". Now that question, as we have often had it, enfolded a truth. That little pronoun 'me' embodied a truth of far-reaching importance. It included every person in this room tonight who is a believer in Christ. Such was its importance. It implied journeyings; many of these members were far away, ourselves included. The Lord had every one of us in mind: such is He. John says that He died to "gather together into one"without mentioning the body-"the children of God who were scattered abroad", @John 11: 52. John mentions that; and the Lord, in the use of this personal pronoun, as referring to His suffering people, conveyed the thought of the body, His body, whether it be viewed in the local sense or in the general sense. The Corinthians were viewed thus in a local sense, and that is what I have in mind. He says to them, "Now ye are Christ's body, and members in particular",
@1 Corinthians 12: 27. That is one of the statements in the epistle that are foundational; that is, a large structure is reared upon it. "Ye are Christ's body": the Lord had that in mind, and it involved journeyings. He appeared to Saul (and it was a long distance away from Jerusalem) and announced it to him. I have no doubt the apostle Paul would never forget that, as the truth was unfolded in his soul and as he applied it to others; these words with heavenly warmth would never be lost to him. We are told elsewhere that it was in the
{197}
Hebrew tongue-as if to enlist his sympathies; as much as to say, 'Saul, I do not want to prejudice your mind'. "It is hard for thee"; that shows the sympathy, the divine sympathy, that accompanied the light and the instruction bound up in the word 'me', whom Paul was persecuting. How did it react upon him, and how should it react upon us, too, if in any way, by word or deed or attitude, we are persecuting the Lord's people? We slip into it very easily, for though we may have good reason to speak against a person, at least from our point of view, yet in that way we may be persecuting him.
Now Peter, in what happens here, senses all this. It says that he went through all quarters. The word 'quarters' is not there in the original, as if, it seems to me, to make the force of the word 'all' stronger. It is a sort of indefinite thing, without limit. He is in accord with the Lord's mind. I do not suppose that if we had been there with Peter he could have told us much about the body of Christ, but he was in the sense of the thing, involving that the ministry implies journeyings; so he went "through all [quarters]". His mind was in that direction, ready for anything that God might require. We have no word of command given to him at this time; it is mentioned in such a way as to show how a minister comes into the current. He cannot afford to be out of it; if he stays out of it he will come into stationary waters and become waterlogged. Peter says, 'I do not want that': he is in the current. He descended, we are told, to Lydda, and he finds Aeneas lying on a couch, paralysed for eight years, the Spirit of God reminding us of how accurately heaven takes account of these conditions.
As you move about in any little way, you may think and say, 'This local condition has been going on now for several years', which is sorrowful. This man's condition had lasted eight years. Peter could not explain it to you as I can explain it now; I mean the
{198}
spiritual bearing of this occasion. It was in relation to what had happened at Damascus, as in the mind of God. What had happened there implied the church in its character as the body, universally and also locally. It was to be seen thus in hundreds, and even thousands, of places on earth; that was the mind of the Lord when He said "me". He meant the saints whom Saul was persecuting, and these saints were to be found in an ever-widening area. They are found today in this town here, and in many other towns, and as far west as the sun sets there are saints. This passage bears directly on the present moment as to local conditions, the paralysed condition. And Peter says, "Aeneas, ... rise up, and make thy couch for thyself". The figure refers to local conditions, the lying on the couch, implying that somebody else has to do the work. It may be visiting brethren, and the one who is using the couch is, so to say, paralysed, and does not lift a hand to do anything. Peter says, "Rise up, and make thy couch for thyself"; that is to say, 'Make the condition for yourself; do not expect others to do it'. But how do you make the bed? Make it properly, as it should be made, surely. You cannot suppose heaven asking us to do something other than to do it properly.
We have often alluded to this passage; the Scriptures are infinitely profound; we never get to the bottom of them; they are intended to be so. They wear and wear and wear, and apply to varied conditions; so that it is a question now, as the Lord seems to suggest it, of persons who are in the local setting church-wise, as we speak, that they should not expect others to do things that should be done, certainly not to do things for their own comfort, but that they should do things themselves. The idea is, as Acts teaches us, the reflection of what is in heaven, heavenly conditions. That is what is in view in Acts; hence we have the light from heaven, the voice from heaven
{199}
and, earlier, the sound from heaven, and later, the sheet from heaven. It is heaven conveying what is up there; and, if I am in accord with heaven, I want heavenly conditions. I will soon expose myself in my making if I am not heavenly: I will make my bed in an earthly fashion or a worldly fashion; but if I am in the light of heaven I will make it according to heaven's requirements.
Then, as if the spirit of instinct was followed in the verses, those who dwelt at Joppa have a circumstance. It is a female disciple, not simply a certain disciple; that is to be noted. Aeneas means the side of authority, "a certain man". As we find in the gospel of Luke (who wrote this book), every convert through the gospel is to be material for the assembly. In his gospel we find one after another, each conveying, as helped by the Lord, some feature of the assembly. Amongst those is a woman who had an internal disease (chapter 8); before her we have the account of the man who had been a demoniac and he is sitting clothed at the feet of Jesus, in his right mind; that is to say, he represents the mental or intelligent or authoritative side-and how much he is needed, sitting clothed and in his right mind! A balanced mind is one of the greatest needs amongst us, sitting at the feet of Jesus; he is not yet like Mary, hearing His word, but the point is his restfulness and balance, and his respectability spiritually. He is a very important man, a man to be respected spiritually. Then the woman had an internal disease, and Mark mentions her body; Luke speaks about her transparency. She represents what is secretive, for she purposed to enjoy the benefits and say nothing about it. She is not church material; she is an opaque person; she is not outwardly what she is inwardly. A member of Christ must be transparent; there must be that through which Christ, as it were, can shine; and that is what she comes to. She represents that sort of church
{200}
material, and she falls down, we are told, in the presence of all the people and told all the truth; that is, everything is out. Then the maid of twelve years of age would represent in that chapter the youthfulness and freshness of the material of the assembly. It is a beautiful combination, man and woman and child; and it is right to speak of it now because of this word, "a female disciple". She represents the feeling side of the position. If it be spiritual, well and good, but if the feeling side is not spiritual, it is ill, it is damaging. I often say that in our comings together there are three phases of the meeting: first the sitting down, when we speak together of the things of the Lord with a measure of sobriety; then the meeting at the back of the room where we talk freely, and feeling comes out, the sisters having as much to say as, or more than, the brothers. There we may have complaints right away, when we have been talking together about the Lord, when we have been seeking to be sober and spiritual, at least externally, but now feeling comes out, sister against sister, or brother against brother; one brother may be taking another up who said too much, and he did not have enough to say. Then on the street we have perhaps fewer, but perhaps more secretive talkings, some brewing of trouble, it may be. I only suggest that we avoid these things, that we take care of our feelings, for one of the last great features of the Spirit is self-control, that by the Spirit of God I can control my feelings and my words. Thousands of things may be said at the back of the room that should not be said, for they have no edification at all, but just the opposite.
This was a female disciple and she was a worthy person according to the usual estimate of widows, a garment-maker; that is, she dealt in externals. Externals are right in their place, but you want the internals, the secret parts. To put beautiful clothes on a brother or sister who is not right inwardly will
{201}
not do. It is well to clothe the saints with our affections, but do not overdo the feeling side, do not put on clothes that do not suit; that is what a woman like Dorcas is pretty certain to do. She was dealing in externals. God, of course, dealt in externals, for He was the first clothes-maker, but He made clothes from skins; the material was out of death. Dorcas did not use that material. In the next chapter we have a tanner; he corresponds with @Genesis 3, and Peter was in his house. There is no tannery needed for these clothes, no death is needed for Dorcas's garments, and yet she is a respectable sort of woman, well thought of. She sickened and died. We have spoken of sickness and dying: how much of it there is! We have in Luke sick persons and diseased persons. This is a sick person. A disease may be a sort of epidemic in the place, more dangerous and contagious. I know of places where these diseases exist; they are contagious. This is a sick person, there is nothing about contagion here, but she just sickened and died.
The other disciples in the place were in the current of things in some little way, for they washed her after she died. Why did they not do it before? The Holy Spirit would not mention the fact of washing if it were a mere physical thing. They laid her in the upper chamber, which alludes to the current God has introduced; indeed it had been introduced from the time of the institution of the Lord's supper. It appears earlier in the Acts, where the disciples abode, and many dear women were there who were not just like Dorcas, for we do not hear a word about garments being made in the upper room at Jerusalem. Now they place her there; they are in accord to that extent with the current of the moment-a most important thing-and they send two men for Peter. That is another point with Luke-two men. Two men would signify adequate testimony given with all right feeling, manly feeling. We have them, as we know, in chapter 1, at the
{202}
ascension, at the sepulchre and at the transfiguration in Luke. Now we have them here. Do we not need them? There are so many rumours; the conflicting stories we hear are most painful; we need these two men. Let us have recourse to these two men; no matter what we hear about our brethren, get the facts of the case!
Peter came with them. Peter is that type of a servant, ready for the service. He did not say, 'I will follow you'; he came with them, and he came to the upper chamber. He would be at home there, for his own mind was in that current; indeed it was moving on towards heaven, for the heavenly thought had come in. The women are there, weeping widows, soft-eyed persons-not that I speak disrespectfully of any one-but the Spirit of God has this in mind. It is just natural feeling, in a way to be respected and yet not to be respected, for it is out of place here. Peter put them all out. You may say, 'That is very severe, to put dear people out like that'. Many would say today as to that, 'You have killed the servants of the Lord'-it is the natural mind resenting the judgment of God. He put them all out. There is no evidence of any ceremony about it; he would remember what the Lord did in regard to Jairus's daughter. I believe that Peter is on the up line here, and I am speaking now with servants in mind, to be in the current of the mind of heaven for the moment, not to be behind. Peter's epistle confirms all this, how he came into it. Then he knelt down and prayed. What a beautiful example of service! What can he do, a mortal man, about to put off his tabernacle, soon to die himself? He can do nothing more than any of us, but God can do much-what can God not do? All things are possible with God, the Lord said, when the disciples were puzzled. Peter knelt down and prayed, and then he turned to the body. I want you to notice that, and remember what the Lord said to Saul, that word
{203}
that had been uttered from heaven-'me'. 1 Corinthians is the opening up of the doctrine of all this; our very bodies are said to be members of Christ. How essential, therefore, that our bodies should be washed with pure water!
@1 Corinthians 6 should be read in this connection, for we are living in a polluted world. The Corinthians had just come out of polluted paganism, and the apostle has to instruct them as to the pollution of the world; so today the world is becoming pagan in every way, alas! All the laws and principles that should govern christendom are being cast to the winds. How important, therefore, that Christ's own should hold themselves and their bodies so that they can be used as members of Christ! Think of the exaltedness of the fact that our bodies are members of Christ! So Peter, having this in mind, turns to the body. He says to her by name, "Tabitha, arise". She looks on him. It was well that he was there to be looked upon, not those weeping widows; they could not help her. They were occupied with the garments; they had them all there, an exhibition of what she used to do. But she sickened and died by that; she is lost to us. God only can bring her back, and He does bring her back, and her eyes were opened on Peter. She is to be here henceforth as representative of God. Peter gave her his hand and lifted her up. That is what is needed in our localities in many instances. It comes in here as in keeping with the current of things. A present current is running and we do not want to be out of it. All this happens to show what God is doing in these circumstances.
Peter presents the woman living. What a fine person she is now! She is like the Lord, who presented Himself living. The word 'presented' is used there, and so here, "He ... presented her living". We have a living sister or brother henceforth. That is what is in mind in view of Paul's ministry that is to
{204}
follow. The lesson for us is to keep in the current; if you are with God you will be sensitive as to whatever God has brought in. It will not surprise you; you will be thankful for it, and you will move in relation to it, and thus you will be serviceable to the Lord.
{205}
HEAVEN'S OPERATIONS
@Luke 7: 44 - 50; @Luke 10: 38 - 42; @John 11: 23 - 27
J.T. These scriptures are very familiar to us, and we may see from them how any current testimony, any special feature of the truth stressed, is effective, at least in some, if only in one. The special truth in @Luke 7 is the gospel, and the woman is the characteristic effect of it. Nothing is said of this person being evangelised by anyone, the chapter is intended to convey to us that the gospel was prevalent, not only the service of it verbally, but the testimony of Christ as relieving man spoken of freely. John having heard what the Lord was doing, the Lord directs his messengers to tell him what was current, and moreover, it is said that the publicans, the tax-gatherers and the like, justified God, having heard; that is what was current. This woman represents the result of what is current. And then Mary, in chapter 10, represents the result of what had been announced from heaven on the mount of transfiguration, "This is my beloved Son hear him"; she was affected by that, she was listening to Christ. Martha was not affected here, but in a later testimony, that is the special testimony to the Son of God in @John 9: the Lord calls attention to Himself in that chapter as the Son of God, and He is worshipped as such: that is the truth that governs that section. So that Martha, in her confession of faith, recognised that. The Lord had challenged her as to what she believed, whether she believed what He said just then, that He was the resurrection and the life; her confession was, "I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who should come into the world". She was affected by the current testimony; she believed it; she makes a confession of her faith, and that is in relation to what is current, what is
{206}
special; and then all these instances lead to what is systematic or collective in the testimony, and in @Luke 8 we have the Lord, at the beginning of the chapter, moving in the cities and villages systematically, regularly; the twelve were with Him, and certain women also were with Him and ministered to Him; that is, there is a public systematic testimony collectively. In chapter 11 we have the local setting of the saints, the Lord seen praying in a certain place; and the outcome of what we get there is @John 12, that is, the state of things at Bethany; the local conditions at Bethany are the result of the special testimony. There is always a special current, and the result bears on something for God. That was what I was thinking of.
M.W.B. Would the fact that each testimony in its true result is found in what is collective imply that if we have not reached what is collective we have not reached the desired end that the Lord has in view in the testimony?
J.T. That is what I was thinking; the result must culminate in what is collective and, we may say, local. Any special testimony, if it affects us rightly, must bear on that. If what the Lord is helping us in in our own times is effective, it will bear on what is general and what is local too; what is for God and for general testimony. It must bear on these things and give character to them, that is, if it is effective in us. The point in these passages is not that any of these persons were special subjects of testimony or service at the moment, but they come into the current of things.
M.W.B. Does the fact that they were three women suggest that it is the subjective result that is manifest in them?
J.T. I think that is plain. These are two of the five women in Luke who bear on assembly formation. The first is in chapter 4, where the Lord stands over the feverish woman and rebukes the fever and she serves them. The second is here in chapter 7, where
{207}
we have a *lover* of Christ; He turned towards her, indicating that that was what was in His mind. The third is in the next chapter, the woman who had the issue and who fell down and told all the truth -- transparency. The fourth is Mary, this one in chapter 10, indicative of intelligence, for she listened to what the Lord was saying. The fifth is in chapter 13, where the woman had been crooked, that is, the devil had affected her; the devil had made a speciality of her in bending her over so that she could not look up. The Lord released her, laying His hand on her, meaning that He is identified with that feature, and she glorified God. That is the full thought, a vessel in which God is glorified. These two are selected today, not so much for that side of the truth, but rather to show the effect of what is current.
Ques. Do you suggest that the gospel rightly received produces a lover of Christ?
J.T. Yes, that is the thought. There is a great deal current today that many are oblivious to; they do not read, they do not make enquiry much, they are more or less formal in their attendance at the meetings, and they do not come into the current of things unless there are people who tell them things specially. Thank God, there are those who do tell us, but that is not enough. There are saints who are intelligent, and they reach the full results; otherwise they do not. No one should say, 'I did not know about these things': if you do not know, it is that you are not attentive enough. There is not the slightest evidence that anyone evangelised this woman, yet she loved Christ and served Him and the Lord turns to her, as much as to say, 'That is the result I am seeking'.
Ques. Would she be one of wisdom's children always attending at the posts of her doors?
J.T. That is it.
F.S. Would the fact that she came to such a
{208}
household suggest that if you are after something you get it?
J.T. It suggests she was not oblivious to the current of opposition, she brooked it; it was to bring out the effect of the testimony on her.
Ques. Have you in mind, in pointing out this woman, that there was not only the fact that she loved but it was seen and known so that the Lord points it out, turning to her?
J.T. Quite so. The fact that He turns to her is, I think, to call attention to what is there; He could occupy Himself entirely, for the moment, with it, as if to say, 'This is what I had in mind'. As (to use a figure) with any one who produces things, he has an idea to produce something, whether it is the contemplation of vegetables or trees or flowers, or anything else; he has an ideal, and when it is reached, he is occupied with it and will occupy others with it. This woman is the result attained, and I believe she is brought in to remind us of the importance of being engaged with what is current, and never to offer an excuse as to not knowing: things are to be known, and, if they are to be known, I should know them.
Ques. When you say 'what is current', have you in mind what God would occupy us with at the moment?
J.T. Just so. What was prevalent was affecting people here. The Lord's message to John is calling attention to what anyone could see; they were to go and tell John what was happening.
Rem. Even a man like Herod heard what was going on.
J.T. Quite so. The Lord said, "Blessed is whosoever shall not be offended in me", but there is nothing new said to John; it was what was current, what anybody could see.
Rem. It is only as we are alert that these things are discovered to us.
{209}
J.T. Yes, you have your instruments set, as it were, to what is current; you have an ear to hear. It says in @Acts 11 that certain "things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem"; that is, the church had ears.
M.W.B. I suppose it discloses a lack of interest if we do not move ourselves so as to be acquainted with what is going on, spoken of in general terms.
J.T. I think so. One is speaking now in a very practical way; if others know, if others speak of these things and are affected by them, they are common things, in a sense; why should they not be so to me? Why should I not be listening? The Lord will turn to me if I am listening, He will call attention to me.
M.W.B. So it is a question of the violent taking things by force; there has to be energy exerted, otherwise things are known in a general way but never taken up.
J.T. Quite so.
Rem. Two of John's disciples heard the testimony of Jesus and followed, and the Lord turned to them.
J.T. Just so. John did not specially preach to them there; it was the thought of his heart he gave out for anyone who had ears to hear; they heard it and they moved and got to the place where the Lord resided.
Rem. And the woman in @Luke 7 would be the normal result for everyone.
J.T. That is the thought, she is the full product; He turned to her and said to Simon, "Seest thou this woman?"-the Lord, as it were, was thoroughly committed to the result and pleased with it.
F.S. And would He in grace make an appeal drawing attention to the woman so that we may follow the lead she had given in that direction?
J.T. That is the thought, I am sure, in the record. It is a wonderful gospel picture, known to us no doubt, but the product is perhaps not examined
{210}
thoroughly, how the Lord turns to her and speaks of her as a lover of His own.
Ques. Why did the Lord go over this detail again, in reference to what the woman had done?
J.T. It was so delightful to Him, is it not so? And He uses the superlative degree, "She loved much".
Ques. Is it interesting, in that way, that her love comes out in what might be called a background of Philistine opposition?
J.T. It is. I suppose it draws out the strength of her love. She might have avoided going into that house and waited for another opportunity, but she overcame the current against her, for the feeling against her in that house must have been very keen. It is the setting of love that overcomes that.
Rem. It meant great reproach for her to go into Simon's house; we avoid reproach sometimes, but the Lord would have us accept it.
J.T. To bring out the setting of love she had.
M.W.B. Do you think the Lord allows circumstances of a testing character in order to bring out the love that exists there?
J.T. I think He does.
Ques. So would Simon suggest what is current in christendom generally, whereas the woman is moving in the current of what is spiritual?
J.T. Yes. We see the readiness of the Jews to come to Jesus on behalf of the centurion and what happened in Nain: "This report went out in all Judea concerning him, and in all the surrounding country"; it was a widespread matter. And then it says, "The disciples of John brought him word concerning all these things: and John, having called two of his disciples, sent to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that is coming, or are we to wait for another?", and they repeated John's message to the Lord. "In that hour", it says, "he healed many of diseases and
{211}
plagues and evil spirits, and to many blind he granted sight. And Jesus answering said to them, Go, bring back word to John of what ye have seen and heard that blind see, lame walk, lepers are cleansed, deaf hear, dead are raised, poor are evangelised". That was what was going on. And then the Lord speaks about John and shows in His remarks that the tax-gatherers justified God, having been baptised with the baptism of John; they heard. "All the people who heard it, and the tax-gatherers, justified God, having been baptised with the baptism of John"; that is, they were affected by the current testimony. And then we have, "Wisdom has been justified of all her children", and this one is brought out; it is a question of what is going on, and wisdom's children coming into evidence, wisdom's ways in the chapter; the effect is in this one, this special case.
Rem. Simon really had not got hold of what was current, so he falls into the category in verse 30.
J.T. Yes, he renders null the counsel of God; he is in another current; that is not wanting today. But there is a spiritual current, and if brethren are not alive to it we cannot say just what will happen, but they are certainly losing and they are not a testimony to what is current.
Ques. Do you regard John as one who had dropped out of the current for the moment?
J.T. Yes, although he knew what was current, but apparently his faith failed.
Ques. Sometimes the gospel is apparently received without the lover of Christ being produced; would you help us a little with regard to that?
J.T. Well, that is the thought. If a lover of Christ is not forthcoming there is not much, however much may be said about confession and forgiveness. There is something here today that the Lord turns to. In chapter 10 He turns to the disciples; in chapter 22 He turns to Peter when he is confessing, and the cock
{212}
crew; there is something going on that is interesting to heaven when the Lord turns to it, and this is par *excellence* what He has in mind, a lover.
Ques. Would you say that a divine Person came into manhood in order that He might be loved? Is that right?
J.T. I think that is a fair way of putting it.
Rem. And here is the result of it.
J.T. A lover in the presence of fierce opposition, of scorn. What a wonderful result she was! Then you find in the next chapter the Lord "went through the country city by city, and village by village, preaching and announcing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God; and the twelve were with him, and certain women who had been healed of wicked spirits and infirmities, Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, and Joanna, wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered to him of their substance"; that is, the bearing is a collective systematic testimony, which is the first thing we get in these three instances. There can be no doubt that this woman represents what is seen publicly with Jesus, ministering to Him; and then here we have those who ministered to Him of their substance.
Ques. What would the substance be?
J.T. I think what this woman had, for after all, what is there but love? No doubt they were material things, but then spiritually what is the Lord thinking about now? What love supplies.
Ques. Would you say that John raised the question as to whether he was to wait? The woman refused to wait, she takes her alabaster box now.
J.T. Very good. John was not ministering to Him; how could he in a state of unbelief? The Lord speaks to the woman of "Thy faith"; she was a possessor of things, she had love and she had faith and she had myrrh, all these things.
{213}
Ques. Is love indicated in the bringing of myrrh? She brought an appreciation of His suffering love and was prepared to suffer to bring it.
J.T. That is it, she was in complete correspondence with Him. He was suffering; she knew that. She knew those feet had carried grace to her involving His sufferings. On the other hand, He would sympathise with her, for she was suffering too; hers was a suffering love; the myrrh was quite in keeping with her state. The opposition must have been extremely severe in that house; she was under scorn. Think of what was going on in that Pharisee's mind, what feeling there was! She brooked all that; she carried on her service to Jesus in spite of all that. It was the love that would suffer for Him that He might be ministered to.
Ques. She "has not ceased kissing my feet", what would that indicate?
J.T. It is the persistency of the love, I think; it is continuous.
F.S. So is the Lord going through the country city by city and village by village to encourage and minister to all those who are effected in the same way?
J.T. Yes, I think the effect of that ought to be seen in the kind of testimony that is carried on publicly. This is the order, "city by city, and village by village, preaching and announcing the glad tidings ... and the twelve were with him". That is the idea, that the love is now operative in them; they are with Him in this position. These women show the subjective feature. The twelve are the authoritative side, but the women supply the comforts, the joys: they ministered to Him of their substance.
Ques. Would it indicate too that they moved in a mutual way?
J.T. Well, the movement here, I think, was in a way that indicated that the Lord is organising, that He has certain under His hand. It is not Himself
{214}
alone now, He has the twelve, those who will carry on under His orders, representing His authority, and those who, at the same time, have affection and are showing it by ministering to Him.
Ques. "That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance"; is this an instance of that?
J.T. That is it.
Rem. Then how Hiram, who was ever a lover of David, would minister to him!
J.T. Quite so.
M.W.B. And both are the result of what is ministered in the previous chapter, both the ministering to Him and being with Him in His movements evangelically.
J.T. I think so. These twelve are, of course, qualified persons who will join in in a public testimony, preaching and healing, but the women have the supply of what the Lord needs. What does the Lord need? Who knows what He needs but those who love Him? He has needs. We think we are the only ones who have needs, but He has needs: they ministered to Him.
Ques. Would administration come out in connection with the twelve?
J.T. Yes, it is an administrative number. It denotes that love is current, and not only in the women, but in those who have ability and gift. It is not perhaps so easy for those who have gift to serve Christ and move together with others, but here they do; it is a beautiful scene, and manifestly the outcome of chapter 7.
Ques. With regard to the Lord's needs, an instance is seen of that in @John 4: "Give me to drink".
J.T. Quite so.
-.M. Would David's three mighty men indicate those who were prepared at great suffering to minister to the Lord's heart when they drew water out of the well of Bethlehem?
J.T. That is a beautiful example. So much did
{215}
David value that that he poured it out before the Lord.
F.S. Unless we are moving in the sympathetic current of what has been given we shall not be able to detect what the Lord needs.
J.T. It hardly enters into the minds of any of us that the Lord is needing anything; He is just looking after our needs, of course He is, but He is looking for affection.
Ques. Is it what the Lord ministers to us in this way that produces a company set together who learn to move and minister to Him, and thus there is something for the glory of God?
J.T. Just so. First we have the kind of persons. Mary is mentioned as one out of whom seven demons had gone. Some think she is the one mentioned in chapter 7 and no doubt, in principle anyway, she is; a person who had been entirely possessed by Satan, seven demons, she was a person of that kind. Then you have others, such as the wife of Herod's steward. It is very much like @Acts 13 where you have a variety of persons ministering to the Lord and fasting, some from the lower classes and some from the better classes, as we speak, showing how the gospel affects all kinds of people; and now they are together ministering to Christ. It is assembly formation, as the apostle says, "Consider your calling, brethren", the kind of persons that are called.
Rem. It is "many others", we should covet to be one of the many, should we not?
J.T. Yes. Without their names being mentioned.
M.W.B. Why is it in this order here?
J.T. I think it is the administrative order; not only have you love, ministering to the Lord, but qualified persons to help men. Subsequently these men are sent out to do the same things as the Lord is doing. I think it is the public testimony; it is independent of the world, they did not have to make public collections to carry on; these women supplied
{216}
what was needed. It is a self-contained thing, taking nothing from the world, as John says.
Ques. How would you distinguish between the preaching and the announcing?
J.T. I think the preaching is more the exercise of gift, it is one who is sent that preaches. Announcing is not just the same. It is remarkable we have the two words.
Ques. Is it seen in its dual character in Philip? He preached "the Christ" in Samaria, but to the Ethiopian eunuch he "announced the glad tidings of Jesus".
J.T. Just so.
F.S. Would this give us the right setting for the gospel, that it is in an atmosphere that ministered to Him, not simply ministering to the needs of men?
J.T. Yes, the twelve represent what ministers to men in the system; the women represent what keeps it going independently of the world.
M.W.B. Might we move on to the next point?
J.T. Yes. I think it is interesting to link this section up with John ii. Martha got nothing in this section, as Luke presents her; but, if the Spirit of God introduces her, she will not pass out of the scene without some divine effect being produced. She is not equal to this testimony; she is not prepared for it; hence it is that many miss the blessing, because of unpreparedness, self-occupation; another alongside them, who was ready for it, gets it; Mary was ready for it. The announcement from heaven in chapter 9 was not in her ears; it was in the ears of Peter, John and James, but it was a current testimony, and she was equal to that, so that the Lord commends her; He says of her, "Mary has chosen the good part, the which shall not be taken from her". I think He would call attention to what is current and raise the question as to whether we are all getting any good of it, whether
{217}
we are affected by it; if so, the Lord would call attention to us.
Ques. Would Martha, up to this point, be listening to the teaching of the law, which has now been set aside?
J.T. That is right. She is on the old line, which is also current of course. It is not what is of God for the moment; that was the announcement from heaven on the mount. We might say, 'Well, how did Mary know?'. That is the point; she did know, she was acting on it-she was listening to Him.
M.W.B. She was in exact keeping with what the Father said. We would desire to be in keeping with what the Father wishes as to Christ.
J.T. Yes.
Rem. It was a wonderful thing she had got, something that would not be taken away from her.
Rem. In speaking to Martha there is a peculiar appeal on the part of the Lord to bring her into it.
J.T. Undoubtedly, and, knowing the end from the beginning, He knew she would come into a testimony, but not this one; she missed this one; we do not want to miss anything the Lord is stressing. In that section in John the Lord calls attention to Himself as the Son of God; heaven had already done this and directed that we should hear Him; Mary came into that, but Martha missed it. But now the Lord calls attention to Himself; He says to the blind man whose eyes had been opened, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?"; it is the Lord calling attention to Himself as Son, and He is doing it now.
M.W.B. In the instances we have looked at: in the first, it was what was generally current, the evangelical thought, what was available; in the second, it was the distinctively secret information as to the Father; then it was the Lord drawing attention to Himself.
{218}
J.T. Well, the setting in @John 9 is that the blind man is cast out; this testimony is to him. It is not so public as @Luke 7, nor is @Luke 10 so public as @Luke 7. As you say, @Luke 9 is the Father's voice on the mount; here it is the Lord's own word to an outcast for his consistency with the truth, his consistent assertion of the truth as it came to him. The Lord heard that man was cast out and He found him, and said, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God? He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?". He was equal to the test: "that I may believe on him", he was ready for it, but he had not the testimony of the Son of God as yet: as soon as he heard it, he worshipped Him. That governs this whole section, I believe, till you come to chapter 12, where you have this wonderful scene at Bethany. I suggested these verses because they show that Martha's confession of faith includes what the Lord said to this man, "I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who should come into the world"; that is her confession of faith. The next chapter shows she was equal to that; she was in her right place; she had lost the spirit of complaint and was ready to serve now.
M.W.B. Mary is listening in @Luke 10; would that be essential if we are to follow on the lines of @John 9 to 12?
J.T. I think the listening is part of the local furnishings. The Lord "entered into a certain village; and a certain woman, Martha by name, received him into her house"-the house was Martha's. And see what comes out! Mary was sitting at His feet and listening to what He was saying; that is the element that is essential to a local assembly, that is, are we intelligent?
Ques. Does it not in that way bring out the great feature of headship?
J.T. I think it does; it is the kind of thing that is
{219}
needed in the assembly for assembly service. What He was saying would be the disclosure of His mind. What is His mind? 'I cannot afford to miss one word', she would say; she was in the attitude of hearing all He said. She was not asking questions; it is right enough to ask questions, but better, if the Lord is speaking, not to interrupt at all; let Him say what He will, and in that way we get all that is in His mind; what could be greater than that! How essential it is to our local companies that this kind of thing is there. Judas, not the Iscariote, said to the Lord, according to @John 14, "How is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us and not to the world?". Well, that was a good question. The Lord's answer is, "If any one love me, he will keep my word". It is not 'my commandment' here; He had already spoken of that, but now it is "My word".
Ques. The "word" here is in the singular. Would it be that listening to His word would be everything that would express Himself?
J.T. I think that is right; not any particular word, but what He had to give.
Rem. No doubt there would be the word of the Father too.
J.T. Yes, there is the Father's word. "Sanctify them by the truth: thy word is truth"; there is that. I think the Lord would bring us to what is in His own mind. Now, take the saints together in assembly, what is in the Lord's mind? His word indicates to us what is in His mind. If we take @John 13 to 17, we get an example of what is in the Lord's mind. Well, we want to follow that current, what is in His mind; His word declares what is in His mind, and Mary would get that. Were she in assembly she would know what was in the Lord's mind. So the Lord says, "If any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him".
{220}
His word implies tabernacle requirements, what divine Persons require, the Lord's word would disclose that; you find out what is required as in His mind. There are conditions there for Them to come, and with one person.
Ques. Would it be right to say that this village did not get its name until Mary and Martha came there?
J.T. The idea is that it is a place, every city and village; in @Luke 10 it is "every city and place" that all bears on this section, which includes local conditions. How can there be local conditions suitable to heaven save as we understand what is in the Lord's mind? He has a mind about the saints in assembly, how we are to proceed.
Ques. Would you think a company of listeners would get the Lord's mind in that way and move from @Luke 10 to @John 12, where it is no longer her house, but "the house"?
J.T. That which was filled, you mean?-quite. "The house", not Martha's house, but the house where the Lord is being entertained.
Ques. And were they not all of one mind there, men and women of substance?
J.T. Quite so, the order is perfect there. He came to Bethany six days before the passover, meaning He is not observing man's days; He has a time of His own, not regulated by man's pleasure, and surely the Lord has a right to use time at His pleasure; it was He who inaugurated days, working in each of them; He should be free to use them as He pleases. Hence our first day of the week is the Lord's day, it is His using a day as He pleases; it is not the sabbath; He passed by that, and selected the first day of the week. He came to Bethany six days before the passover. So in chapter 13 He was not observing the passover, no doubt He did, but it was "before the passover" that certain things happened. Our feast days are not the feast days of the Church of England, or any other such
{221}
days; they are the days the Lord has selected. So Jesus "six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where was the dead man Lazarus". He came in relation to him. So you get this beautiful state of things which is all the result of what we have been speaking of, that they had all become affected by the current testimony.
M.W.B. Why is it particularly the Son of God in that part of John?
J.T. I suppose the time had come to bring that out. The washing in @John 9 is not washing off anything that was in itself impure; it was what the Lord Himself had made and put on the man's eyes. That is, it is the removal of the world in which Christ was in His flesh and blood condition, He took flesh and blood to set aside in fact the whole order of things into which He came.
M.W.B. "A man called Jesus", he says, "made mud"; you would make a distinction between Jesus as here in the world of divine ordering as it was then connected with judaism, and this new title of Son of God?
J.T. Yes. The time had come for Him to bring this out as to the world into which He came. Of course He greatly added to it. Many say they would have liked to have been here when the Lord was here; but the Lord died out of that condition, never to resume it, and the title "Son of God" as brought in there has to do with another condition of things. That is something it is important for us to get hold of. I think in that section it is not simply the revelation of God, as earlier in the gospel of John, but that He brings in another world. The man whom He takes up and who worships Him is representative of the sheep that the next chapter brings out, the one flock, and that for the moment is provisional, the new order of things involving the assembly, pending the coming of the Lord when we shall have an entirely new world
{222}
regulated by the Son of God. I believe that is what is in mind, not this world, even with Christ in it; that has to come to an end; it is Christ in another world with Christ in a new condition, what He is now.
Ques. So that the washing of the man's eyes would be not knowing "Christ according to flesh"? "Old things have passed away, behold all things have become new".
J.T. That is it.
M.W.B. So it is not exactly the view of the Son of God as spoken of at the end of @Matthew 14, for instance, where they worship Him in the boat, or in @Psalm 2, which speaks of the Son of God. It is the same Person but in a different setting.
J.T. I think so. He is the Inaugurator of another world, He is in a new condition.
Ques. Would it be the same thought as John gives us, "This is the victory which has gotten the victory over the world, our faith", that is, the faith of the Son of God?
J.T. Yes, and "Who is he that gets the victory over the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God?", @1 John 5: 5. It all goes with this, I think. Then the Lord opens up the truth of the Shepherd to this man, in the next chapter. I believe the one flock is provisional, the new order of things; but we are concerned now with the effect of it on Martha; in her confession of faith she says she believes that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God who should come into the world, and she goes off to tell Mary, and the Lord does not check her. I believe that is the end reached in her.
Ques. It says in Proverbs, not only that substance is inherited, but "I will fill their treasuries". Does Martha come in now as being a treasury, like Mary?
J.T. I think so. The Lord does not put the words into her mouth; they are manifestly the out come of her own faith. He says, Do you believe this?
{223}
He challenged her as to what she believed, and her answer is her confession of faith, and it is in her own words, but the words correspond with @John 9.
Ques. Does sorrow, in that way, make room for enlargement in the thoughts of Christ? There was no room for enlargement with Martha in @Luke 10 for she was encumbered. Does it not set our sorrows, as moving together, in a wonderful light as making the way for the Lord to make disclosures to us?
J.T. Yes. If He takes any one of us up, He may have to wait, but He will reach His result. Staying away for two days was deliberate; and we may make up our minds that, if He has come to us at all, He will have His way with us; and we may as well bow at the beginning that He may not have to inflict such severe things upon us; but He will reach His end.
Ques. Martha adds "the Christ" as well as "the Son of God"; is that the full thought reached?
J.T. Yes, the full thought of what Christ is for God.
{224}
WHAT IS SAID IN THE HEART
@Psalm 10: 6, 11, 13; @Genesis 8:21, 22; @Romans 10: 6 - 10
These scriptures speak of what is said in the heart. There is much around in the world in the way of speaking and writing that is public, public oratory and newspapers. Every morning brings its quota of this, and men, women and children are occupied with what is presented. The morning newspaper is now regarded as essential to what is called the life of the world as are the accompanying things, such as books, whether they are true or false. The world is going on on these lines and others like them, but these things do not always set out what is going on in men's hearts. God is taking account of what goes on in hearts; so @Psalm 10, the scripture of the wicked, gives us something of what goes on, and what is being said, in wicked hearts. God would not occupy us much with what men, wicked men, are saying in their hearts, save that many of those who are to be saved are at the moment wicked, and may have part in these very remarks, may be saying these very remarks.
In @Psalm 14 we have the fool who says in his heart, "There is no God". He may not say it openly if he seeks to please a christian; he perhaps would not say it to a christian, but he says it in his heart, and the saying of it proves that he is a fool. I do not suppose anyone here would say that there is no God; you would hardly be here if you were saying that in your heart an hour ago; it is the fool who says it, and he is shown to be a fool because it is characteristic, as if no one but a fool would say it. Christians, indeed, often say things that are the height of folly, for a christian may be very far away from God, and be characterised by folly. God knows what you are
{225}
saying in your heart. It may be that you have said things in your heart about some other person; that is, it is folly to say it, saying it in your heart is the height of folly; God knows what is said in your heart. @Psalm 14 and @Psalm 53 represent a fool particularly characterised by such folly as to say in his heart, "There is no God". I suppose it suits him to say that; it is according to his feelings to say it. But the man in @Psalm 10 is not called a fool, but he is one, only that the point in @Psalm 10 is that he is not described as a fool, but as a wicked man, and what he says in his heart. He does not deny that there is a God, but he does deny God, and he does say things in his heart that are according to his feelings about God, that suit him; what he says in his heart suits his state, his ambitions, his outlook; he speaks in his heart in relation to his calculations, to his ambitions, to his outlook, and, whilst he does not deny that there is a God, he misrepresents Him totally. In the first verse I read it says, "He saith ... I shall not be moved". *I shall not be moved*! Overlooking that great rulers are moved, men whose position seemed impregnable, overlooking one overthrow after another that is current, *he* says, I shall not be moved. Is there anyone here who has such assurance as this? who does not know God? who is not a converted person? It may be that you are assured that your business matters are good, the position is sure, your salary is assured, your health is good, your outlook is good, and you are saying in your heart, "I shall not be moved". God would say to you tonight that that is the language of a wicked man. Whatever your public history may be, that is the language of a wicked man. You look at the graveyards and the constant flow of the dead into those graveyards, and you would say, I shall not be moved? God would upset you in your calculations this very night; He would call you a fool too. But I am speaking now of the language of a wicked person,
{226}
a wicked man, and you do not want to be classified amongst them. But if that is the language of your heart, it is the language of a wicked person, and God would upset it. He may tell you that this night your soul shall be required of you. Does that move you? You are hardened to that? You say, I have often heard that; and the more often you have heard it, and it has had no effect upon you, the harder you are. But God would dislodge any such thought this very night, that you shall not be moved. How easily God could change it all if He were to say, and act accordingly, "This night thy soul shall be required of thee". Not your *body*. If you are a christian God requires your body; He claims your body, as a christian's body. The epistle to the Romans brings out that truth, that the christian's body is claimed by God. But if God has to speak to any person who has such folly in his heart as to think, 'I shall not be moved', He would say, This night thy soul shall be required of thee. What for? Why should God require your soul? In the gospel of Luke such requirement implies judgment. How solemn it is that God should require a man's soul in judgment. What will He do with it?
Does God need it? This night, *this* night, *thy* soul shall be required of *thee*. That is, you have got to give it up.
And then it goes on to say here, in verse ii, "He saith in his heart, God hath forgotten, he hideth his face, he will never see it". That is in relation to some conduct. How the wicked man would love to think that God had forgotten his wickedness, that God hides His face from it, that He will never see it. Is there anyone here who is talking like that in his heart? Has God forgotten? No, beloved friends. God keeps books most accurately, and in them He records all acts of wickedness. He has no pleasure in it, I can understand that, but He does it, for the books are opened, we are told, and the wicked dead (that is
{227}
what this psalm is treating of) will stand before God, and God has everything recorded in these books. "The sea gave up its dead", as if to say there are no dead, no wicked dead, that are not brought up. The sea, even the unexplored sea, so far as man is concerned, gives up its dead. It is not unexplored by God, He knows its depths, and the wickednesses of all the dead there are put down in a book, and they will all come up; He does not forget *anything*. I believe the use of books and the use of writing in that remarkable chapter (@Revelation 20), is to remind us to get down to our minds, so that we should understand that God *does* remember; He does not need to make notes (I speak reverently), He does not need to make notes, because He holds things. The wicked man says that God forgets, that He hides His face, that He does not know. Why does he say that? Because he deceives his conscience, he deceives himself. God does not forget, not one iota; no wickedness will be forgotten; He requires what is due. He has it all noted down. Now that is another phase of what is said in his heart by the wicked man. I do hope that no one here is classified with the wicked man. This is a most solemn psalm. It is what comes out in the heart of the wicked, and you do not want to be classified amongst them, saying that God will forget what you have done. He will not forget. Nor does He hide His face from it. He will require it, He has to say to it, and the matter has to be attended to, the books have to be squared, and they will be.
Then in his heart he condemns God. That is a terrible thing. Whereas God is justified; when He enters into judgment He is justified. "Enter not into judgment with thy servant", says one. God will come out on top, God will come out with the last word; He will have the last word, whatever the wicked says in his heart. Faith will justify God; the Lord Jesus justified God. Publicans and sinners
{228}
justify God by confessing their sins. The scribes and Pharisees condemned God. It is a terrible thing to be in that category. He says further, "Thou wilt not require it". He will require it. He is not God if He does not require men to answer for their conduct, that is why, as I said, He stresses the idea of books, so that we should understand that He forgets nothing, and that He requires from men's hands. He enters into judgment, and He is justified in His judgment; so that it says, "The dead, small and great, stand before God; .. and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books ... and whosoever was not found written in the book of fife was cast into the lake of fire". God is justified in that, let us not think it is hard. No! It is love that requires the lake of fire. Sin is intolerable to God; sin is intolerable to those who are taught of God; everyone who is righteous is on God's side with regard to the lake of fire, even although his best friend, as a man of this world, goes there. Let God be just. The wicked man has condemned God, and he has condemned Him in this way, saying, Thou wilt not require it. He *does* require it. He does require, let no one be deceived.
Now I turn from this, with relief, to what God says in His heart. That is what we get in the book of Genesis, what God says in His heart. It is the outcome of what He smelled. God graciously uses terms that we can understand. He "smelled a sweet savour". I praise and bless God that He is pleased to use such language, so that I should understand it. Were He concerned only to maintain His awful majesty as the Deity, He would not use such words as these, would not condescend to use such words; but in coming in in service He maintains His dignity and His government, that is death. Here the flaming sword of the cherubim (chapter 3) maintains the infinite majesty of God, He has not altered one iota of His
{229}
mind against sin; His face is set against sin as in the beginning. Nowhere did that come out more clearly than at the cross. God has not changed His mind about sin; He hates it, and He maintains His majesty in that; but in hating sin He serves the sinner; He comes in in lowly guise and makes clothes for the sinner. Here He smells a savour from the offering of Noah, and He says in His heart, "I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake". 'I know what is in man's heart' (all that is set out in @Psalm 10) but, God says, 'I am not changing My mind a bit'; He does not alter His mind a bit. He says, I am thinking of something else now, I am thinking of Jesus; He came into this world, His savour ascended unto heaven, and heaven announced its delight in Him, and as Jesus is offered up, in type Noah built an altar. What instincts he had, dear friends, what holy thoughts that man had. We have no record that God ever taught him, or ever told him to build an altar. He did it. How delightful it was that he built an altar. He took of all the clean beasts and the clean fowls, reserved nothing for himself; as it were, he was totally unselfish as he offered up the burnt-offering to God, and "The Lord smelled a sweet savour; and ... said in his heart"; *He said in His heart*, it does not imply that He is saying anything to anyone, for God knows how to keep secrets, but He will not withhold them, for the gospel brings out what is in His heart. The epistle to the Romans speaks of the mystery of the gospel, but the gospel is a public matter, and it unfolds what is said here: God said in His heart, "I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart", as the psalm testifies, "is evil from his youth". In spite of that wicked man, God's mind is unchanged, so that He says, 'I will not again curse the ground on account of man, be he ever so guilty, ever so wicked, he is not going to alter My mind'. How comforting
{230}
that is! God is occupied with Jesus, and the wickedest man may come into blessing, may come into justification, may come into glorification, under the power of the Spirit, on the ground of faith; He has smelled a sweet savour, He is full of it, and He says, 'Whatever man may do, I will not alter My mind'. That is, at the present moment. "While the earth remaineth ... day and night shall not cease", @Genesis 8: 22. This very day is in His mind. First the seed time. What is the seed? Well, what is God thinking about? The seed of the gospel, and the harvest the fruit of the gospel. As the Lord Jesus was with the poor sinner at the well of Sychar, that we have so often heard of, He said to His disciples, after she left, after His wonderful conversation with her, after she got the light into her soul of the Saviour's love, as I may say, He said to His disciples, "Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest", @John 4:35. Every man laboured, they sowed, there was the seed time; but this is the harvest, and tonight is a harvest-day, and it is a seed-sowing day, too. Every day is a seed time and every day a harvest time, and God says it shall not cease, He says it in His heart.
Do you not want to come in tonight, to say in your heart-as I read in this passage in the epistle to the Romans-what the "righteousness of faith" says? I have been speaking to you of what writers say, and what newspapers say, and what books say; what wicked men say in their hearts and what God says in His heart; but what does the "righteousness of faith" say? Mark, it is not what "faith" says, it is what the "righteousness of faith" says. I would like to understand that better-the righteousness of faith! It belongs to the category of words peculiar to this epistle, the epistle to the Romans; it is a fundamental epistle, and this word 'righteousness' is the great foundation of faith. The righteousness of faith, what
{231}
does *it* say? Did you ever listen to it? It may be that you never thought of such an expression as this, although it is here. Maybe it never occurred to you that there is such a word, such a subject as this what the righteousness of faith says. What does it say? The apostle speaks about what Moses said and what the law said, but what does the righteousness of faith say? Well, it says to you, 'Do not say these things in your heart'; that is the first thing: do not say certain things in your heart, "Who shall ascend to the heavens?". Paul is quoting from @Deuteronomy 30. The righteousness of faith, mark you. Moses wrote that book, showing what a minister Moses is; he, also, tells us what the law says; but Moses also tells us what the righteousness of faith says, and the first is, do *not say certain things*. What things? "Who shall ascend to the heavens?". That is an infidel question. The explanation of that is in verse 6: "That is, to bring Christ down". Who shall *bring* Christ down? Christ *came* down, beloved friends, He descended. Do not say He did not, do not question it, do not be an infidel in regard to that.
*That* is what the righteousness of faith says. It is important to listen to what you may or may not say in your heart because this is what a nominal christian is apt to say. And then again, "Who shall descend into the abyss?". It is unknown, who knows anything about it but God? And hence we are apt to be infidel in regard to it, but the righteousness of faith says, 'Do not say, Who shall descend?'. Christ descended. And then again, 'Who shall bring Christ up?'. He came up Himself; God raised Him from the dead. The righteousness of faith says, do not question these things. If you are indefinite or uncertain as regards your salvation it is because of these infidel questions. The righteousness of faith would banish them from your heart. Do not ask such questions. Mark, it is not faith only, it is the *righteousness* of faith. What is
{232}
the righteousness of faith? It is that Jesus was delivered for our offences; He descended, and was delivered for our offences, and He rose again for our justification, so that the apostle goes on to say, "The word is near thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart". What word? "The word of faith, which we preach". He quoted from Deuteronomy. He knew what he was speaking about, what he preached. I should like to have heard Paul preach. Among many things that I should like to hear would be men like Paul preaching the gospel. He says, "The word of faith, which we preach". Where is that word? It is nigh you, in your mouth and in your heart. Who says it is not so? Is there one here who can claim exemption from that?
No one. I suppose I may say the whole of Christendom is included in the word of faith. "In thy mouth and in thy heart". What about it? Some of you here, here in this room to hear the gospel, what about this? The word of faith. I am not now speaking of the "righteousness of faith". I have spoken about that; I am speaking now of the word of faith which Paul preached. There is no gospel like the gospel which he preached, "the word of faith, which we preach". I think every preacher ought to aim to preach like Paul. We should preach the kind of word he did. He says to the Corinthians, "The Son of God ... who has been preached by us among you (by me and Silvanus and Timotheus)". What preachings they must have had in those days, all those eighteen months! One would like to know just how they carried on, whether it was in houses, or on walls, at the street corners, or in the open fields; but it was this, the word of faith, which they preached. He is bringing it down here to the believer, to one who has in his heart the very word that Paul preached, *and yet* it has never been effective in your soul. Is it going to be effective tonight in your heart? Are you going to settle the matter? Heaven is looking on and listening,
{233}
has been watching over you, it may be, for some time back in view of this meeting, that you might settle the matter, that it may be no longer simply a matter of what you know religiously; it is nigh you, all round you, your father, your mother, the brethren speak of it; you know it well, and it has never become effective in your heart. Then he says, "If thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord, and shalt believe in thine heart that God has raised him from among the dead, thou shalt be saved". We who are in this wonderful salvation-what the writer to the Hebrews calls "so great salvation"-we who are possessed of it would urge you to join us tonight.
Thou shalt be saved. It is not here like @Acts 16, "and thy house". This is more young people, people who do not own houses. God is very considerate of us; if you are a married man and love your wife and children, He would like you to understand that they will be saved too; but if He is speaking to one of those children He would say that you will have to be saved yourself; you have heard your father, your mother, your brothers and sisters speaking about this, and it has not become effective yet, and the point of this meeting is that it should become effective. @Acts 16 is many persons in one stroke; this is one person, thou. Will you not settle the matter? It is a heart matter; it is a mouth matter too. "The Lord Jesus". I do not know any words more delightful in the mouth of a person, when they are really used in a heart sense, when they are used in faith and, I may add, when they are used in the power of the Spirit of God. "If thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord". Heaven hears every such confession; not only does it hear them, but I believe they have a peculiar resounding effect in heaven; that confession is in accord with heaven; the Father loves to hear it, Michael, the archangel loves to hear it, all the angels love to hear it, saints love to hear it; we here, sitting
{234}
about you, love to hear it, and it implies that you are amongst us as one of us as soon as you confess the Lord Jesus with your mouth, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead.
May God grant that some one, or more, may settle the matter in this way, and that they may come into this great salvation that belongs to those who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.
{235}
"HE IS THY LORD, AND WORSHIP THOU HIM"
@Psalm 45: 11
We were speaking today of Isaac in @Genesis 24, and let me remind you, dear brethren, that the servant's name is not given, nor is it a mere domestic, as in an earlier chapter; it is the eldest servant in Abraham's house; he is a man of importance. That is the point in regard to the servant in @Genesis 24. But when Rebecca asks about Isaac, he says, "That is my master!", not 'my master's son', though Abraham was still alive. It is a tribute to Jesus; He is equal with God. If Abraham is master to the servant, so is Isaac master. That is how Scripture speaks. Let us not allow our minds to work in these things, let us follow the Scripture. So here, in @Ephesians 5, if He presents the assembly to Himself, that is His deity -- no one but a divine Person could do that. Adam did not present Eve to himself (although he was indeed a type of Christ). God presented her to Adam. But the Father does not bring the assembly to Christ here; Christ presents her to Himself. "He is thy Lord", as is said in @Psalm 45, "and worship thou him". So we get these informal statements that testify to His personal glory; the Scriptures are full of them, so that we are built up in them, we breathe them, as it were; in the household of faith we breathe the testimony to the glory of Jesus.
{236}
MOUNT ZION AND JERUSALEM
@2 Samuel 5: 7 - 10; @Psalm 122: 1 - 9; @Isaiah 62: 6, 7
My words have to do with mount Zion and Jerusalem. I set out by the Lord's help to show what they mean respectively and that whilst they have a future bearing they have also a present one; indeed, it is formally stated in the New Testament, dear brethren, that we "have come to mount Zion", @Hebrews 12:22. That is one thought, and the next one in that passage is "and to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem". So that my suggestion will be seen as fitting in with our present circumstances, that we have come to them severally and also in relation to other great things.
They are items, great items of a great system of things that we are said to have come to: mount Zion first, and then "the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem", and "to myriads of angels, the universal gathering; and to the assembly of the firstborn who are registered in heaven" and other things. We are said to have come to them, and as having come to them it is surely within our range to understand, to know what they signify, and the more we do understand all these great things, the more we are to see that they are not merely objective things, that they are things in which we ourselves have actual part; that is a very great thought! The truth is indeed usually presented to us as before us objectively; the truth of the Deity and other great thoughts connected with divine Persons are and always will be objective, for we have no part in the Deity. But then there are great things, as I said, that are presented objectively first so that our minds might receive the impression of them, and then we are led further on as we are with God and seek that the Lord should give us understanding in all things; we are led on to see that they
{237}
are not at a distance but that in truth we are part of them. And this particularly refers to mount Zion and Jerusalem, the city of the living God, as it is called, the heavenly Jerusalem. That is, it is christianity that is in mind; it is the epistle to the Hebrews, the epistle intended to take the believer in the Jewish setting out of it and place him in the other, his final setting, and hence we have the significant word added "heavenly Jerusalem".
Now I wish to make Zion plain especially for our younger brothers and sisters here and indeed for all the children, for the more one looks into Scripture the more one sees that the children, however young, are intended to have part in the greatest things along with the elders. They learn to appreciate the great things as they are represented by the older ones and as it is seen how they are valued. We learn in school best; I may say a classroom is the best place of instruction, learning together. Also as regards eating and drinking, it is much better to eat and drink with others than by ourselves, not that it is not necessary at times to eat and drink by ourselves, but the Lord intimates clearly enough that what He means in christianity is eating and drinking collectively. That is what the Lord's supper means. No one could take part of it by himself-it is a collective thought and we eat and drink constitutionally, as also in the way of enjoyment. I always, I may say simply, partake of a meal with much more relish and profit in the company of the brethren whether at my own table or at others. And so, as I said, the little ones are to share the greatest things of God with the older ones. So that the Scriptures say constantly, referring to the greatest things in the Scriptures, that your children will ask you about these things. They will ask you about them. The segregation of children in instruction is very questionable; the instruction that is best for them is in relation to the older ones. The children of
{238}
Israel "all ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them". How great it is for a child here to get that into his mind, that Christ is the drink; He is following us. Think of the service He renders in all these meetings preparing this, that and the other one to help us. How great a thought it is ! The rock followed them, it is not the general idea of a rock that it follows; a rock is a stationary thought generally, but the rock is Christ, as the scripture says. It is Christ following us in His service, as He follows us with water for our feet, He follows us with drinking water. It is for the children as well as the older ones; they did all drink of the same spiritual drink. They drank of that rock that followed them. They knew where to go. The rock followed them from @Exodus 17 right on. The idea is that the rock followed them; that is, it was always there in that lowly guise, as I might say, like a water-carrier to an army, furnishing what was needed for satisfaction. If they had all drunk rightly of it, they would not have been complaining so much. They murmured for other food.
So, as I said, I would enlist the sympathy of the children. As I was saying to someone lately, when the Lord Jesus came back into Jerusalem for the last time He was in the temple and He was opening people's eyes, even in Jerusalem. We have here the blind hated of David's soul, but the Lord Jesus was opening their eyes in the temple and as He was doing that the little children were saying, "Hosanna to the Son of David". That is what they were saying. It is not just 'Gentle Jesus, meek and mild'. They were saying something much greater than that. I would not belittle that-'Gentle Jesus, meek and mild', but "Hosanna to the Son of David" is a great thought, a thought that belongs to the most developed amongst us, for in that setting it means His divinity, His deity. He was Son of David, and He was David's
{239}
Lord, as the Old Testament proved. The chief priests and the scribes said, 'Do You hear that?'. They were thinking about these eyes being opened; that is what they did not like, the mighty power that was in Jesus. They saw that, and the children singing to the Lord, praising the Lord in the temple, and they say to the Lord, 'Do You hear that?'. And He says, 'Of course I hear that'. Of course He hears the singing of the children and what they were singing, not 'Gentle Jesus, meek and mild', not 'Jesus loves me'; that is not what He had in His mind. These little children's hymns do not signify perfected praise and that is what He spoke of. He says, 'Do you never read @Psalm 8? Did you never read the Scriptures?'. It says, "Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise". What more perfected thing could you get at that time"Hosanna to the Son of David"? How the Lord would enlist anyone here into the great thoughts relative to Christ and who He is. It is for you to know. And you get to know it, I may say to the young people, more easily and quickly as you see the older ones in it, as they take it in.
Now the first passage I read is the first passage in which we find the word 'Zion', as far as I know. And we have the right thought of it, the divine thought as to Zion. Now I want you all to get this thought, young and old, especially young, that applied to ourselves it means our hearts. It means that we are taken up severally by God. It means that if God had not moved towards us we should have been in the dark, in the blindness, of the world; that is where we should have been; that God has looked upon us; before the world was He had us in His mind, and He says, in fact, 'That is where I will dwell'. But you say, God dwells in eternity. He does; He inhabits eternity. The heaven of heavens cannot contain Him, Solomon tells us: unapproachable light is His
{240}
dwelling, as we think of Him. But He dwells there, He "whom no man has seen, nor is able to see", but He says, 'This is the place, here will I dwell, for I have desired it'. We must allow God latitude, liberty of choice. We may not understand it fully; why did He not choose angels to dwell in? He says, "Here will I dwell, for I have desired it". The allusion, of course, is to a hill, but God had more than that in His mind. You can see the hill if you go to Palestine, but God had more than the mere geographical position in mind, He had something more than that when He spoke of Zion, when He said, "Here will I dwell, for I have desired it". That was what David had in mind; that was the first movement after he was anointed by all Israel, that is, all the saints generally accord Christ His place, then He has got great scope.
Now, He says, I can work out the great eternal thoughts of God. How wonderful to have one mind in the Lord, one mind in the Spirit. The more of that there is, the more scope there is for the opening up of the divine mind, and so David and his men come to Zion. They come to Jerusalem, but they come to Zion. David sees whatever there is there, and there was opposition, bitter opposition, and every one of us here can witness to the opposition there is in our hearts to God coming in. Every natural inclination is against that, against God coming into our hearts, against Christ dwelling in our hearts by faith, but He comes in nevertheless. That is a great word, "Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David". That is what is in His mind.
It is the city of David. What a thought it is, that in our hearts and minds, all that there is in the moral sense belongs to Christ. It is His city and collectively the saints are His city. What will He do with the city of David? What will He make of it? That is the next thing to consider. First it is his city, and then it says, "So David dwelt in the stronghold". As
{241}
he takes it, the city of David, as he dwells in it, he calls it the city of David. It has a name. Many give names to their houses. It is a common thing in England to have names on the houses. Properly, if there is any force in the name of a house, it should convey the dweller, it should convey something of the occupant. And that is the idea. He called it the "city of David". It was worthy of that name. Why was it worthy of a name? Why is the name of Jesus put upon us? Why that glorious name by which He was called? Nothing, beloved friends, but the fact that Jesus has a footing in your hearts. You are worthy of it. He called it that. If the Lord calls a thing by name the name conveys what it is. He called it the city of David. It was his, it represented his prowess, it represented his dwelling place, it represented war, the name that he gave to it. It is the city of David.
And now the next thing is how is He going to keep it? For the power of the devil is constantly against that place in the hearts of His people. He has come in sovereignly; He has taken possession and He has given it a name. How is He going to keep it? Well, it says David built inward. Most of you here will know that Joab's name does not come in this record at all; it comes in in 1 Chronicles. There, but not here, it says that Joab took Zion. The Lord may use a valued brother like Paul to take Ephesus, but that is not what is in mind here. If you were to ask Paul who took Corinth, he would say Jesus took Corinth, Jesus Christ. He says, "I have much people in this city"; He knew they were there. Paul was there, Timotheus was there, Silvanus was there, but who took the city, and who took Zion, who took the people of Corinth? Jesus took them, and dwelt in them, but His dwelling was soon disputed and that is the sorrowful side. And so the need of inward building. It does not appear that there was any inward building
{242}
in Corinth. There was much at Ephesus. And so here David built inward because if he does not get inside into the crevices and into the inward parts, the opposition will overcome. The spirit of man is said to be the candle of Jehovah. He searches the inner parts by the candle. It is that He may occupy every crevice, every compartment in the persons. That is His aim in all these meetings; it is what He is doing, as the apostle says, If you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, it is that Jesus Christ is in you, in you my converts, unless you are reprobates. But they were converted. Who converted them and took hold of them?-Jesus Christ. That was the idea.
But as I was saying the inward building may not proceed and that is the danger with us. There is nothing about Joab here at all. There is a hiatus, if you notice, in the New Translation, that is, if you want to speak about him, put that name there, but it is David's work all the same. Whether it was Paul or Silvanus or Timotheus, it was the work of Christ, and He found the place in our hearts.
Well, now I go on from this to the psalm. The passage in the psalm is of David's city. It is what he did, and how those that love Christ love to dwell on what Christ does. As I said before, Paul would love to say, 'It was Christ who did it. It was the power of Christ that did it. Whatever I did, it is Christ speaking in me'. So that is @2 Samuel 5. But when we come to the psalms we look for experience. We always look for experience in the psalms; it is the same people, you know, but what are they thinking about? Ah, says one, "I rejoiced when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of Jehovah". That is, it was no unpleasant thing for him to go to the meetings. That is how it works out. He says, "I rejoiced when they said unto me". I see all this, I see the connection with this in what God is seeking to do, to enlist our intelligences and sympathies and
{243}
affections that we might get into the great thought He has for us. So one says, "I rejoiced when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of Jehovah". It is not 'let you go', but 'let us go'. It is always collective, the house of the Lord. The Lord Himself in Spirit spoke of it, how He kept with the company. They were glad when they went to the house of the Lord. I am not speaking of the house, but rather Jerusalem. The thought of Jerusalem is subservient to the house. The psalm begins with the house, and ends with the house, and what comes in between is what Jerusalem was. It says again, "Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem". He is a definite man; our feet will stand there. That means that if I get in there I am not going to see the sights; I am not going to enjoy myself simply. No! As soon as he gets inside the gates, what is he thinking about? He is thinking about the whole system within the gates. And what does he say? "Jerusalem ...". As soon as he gets inside the gates he is able to tell you about it. When you go out and talk to an unbeliever you say, Come in here, come inside these gates. You will never understand it unless you come inside. Oh, I say to you, young people, do not stay outside. Do not stay outside a moment longer. Come inside the gates. "Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem". And he goes on to say what it is. It is a city compact together. The boundaries are determined; the streets are determined; there is only one street in the new Jerusalem, but it is compact together. Things are cared for there; there is no straggling thought attached to it, as there is to the ordinary city of modern days. Every town, city and village is straggling now. But this is compact together. The allusion is to persons, that persons are related to one another in a compact way. And he says, "Whither the tribes go up". You will see the tribes go up. They will go up in testimony. You should see them,
{244}
see how beautiful are their feet, the footsteps of the flock as they go up! Love and order is implied in the tribes. Elsewhere, indeed, it is a multitude; that is quite intelligible, but the tribes suggest something different from that. They go up for a testimony. All this is to induce the dear people, the young people, to get inside. See the tribes going up. You will say, I would like to be amongst them. Well, it is for the tribes to show that they are getting the thought of God, going up to Jerusalem. Inside, as I said before, you will see the thing, you see the divine thought in it. How they are cared for! Some of our sisters do not like the long brothers meetings. They forget that they have long meetings often, and they do much damage with their long meetings. There is no one to check up what they are saying, but the brothers have to give an account of what they are saying. But when you get inside the gates you say, I will never say a word about the care meetings again. They keep the meetings together, compact. There are endless things in the city; if a man does not care for his house, says Paul, he cannot care for the assembly, and if it is cared for then it is compact together, the saints are compact together. That is the thought.
Well, now he says, "Pray for the peace of Jerusalem". Oh, it needs your prayers! "Pray for the peace of Jerusalem". Some of the dear saints make much of the nice brother; of course, a nice brother is a nice brother, but they make more of the brother than of what he says, his doctrine and his principles. You want to get the principles first. Get the principles before you make up your mind about a brother. Find out his principles and how he applies them. That is the order of God. If you look at the book of Numbers, chapter 4, you see that the Levites are in three families, and the sons of Kohath have a service in connection with the most sacred things. The second is Gershon and he has to do with the principles; he has to look
{245}
after these things. He comes in before the sons of Merari, who are porters and builders. This is the only place where it says the instruments to be carried were dealt out by name (verse 32); that is, they are persons. These are under the hand of Merari. But Gershon's work comes before this. Get the principles first! Insist on the principles before you make much of the persons. Make much of the persons, of course; they will be in heaven, the saints will be, but the principles should come first as down here. That is the reason why I am stressing the idea of care as so important and that all should be brought into it and all should understand that he has to do his part in looking after things.
Well, then the psalmist-this is what I wanted to point out-is inside and noticing the tribes, that they are a testimony; that they are going to give thanks to the name of Jehovah. For there are set thrones of judgment in the house of David. This is all fitting with what I have been saying, that is judgment, but notice, it is "thrones" of the house of David. One could say much about that and others here could say much about that. Judgment here has a millennial bearing, when things are set in order authoritatively, because there are thrones of the house of David, not simply one throne. There was only one throne in David's day. David sat on it, and it is called the throne of Jehovah; but here we have thrones of the house of David. What a great *thought* that is, dear brethren, as we see it in the elders by-and-by; the twenty-four elders have thrones; that is, each is a dignified individual, and there they are on independent thrones. The point here is the new Jerusalem. That is where you get them. They are not outside. There is no judgment according to God outside. And then he says, "Pray for the peace of Jerusalem", and he goes on to say, "They shall prosper that love thee. Peace be within thy bulwarks, prosperity within thy
{246}
palaces. For my brethren and companions sakes I will say, Peace be within thee!". The companions and the brothers and Jehovah-all these come into the desire on the part of the psalmist. He is thinking of all these, Jehovah, the brothers and the companions. The more I love them, the more I will desire the peace of Jerusalem; their enjoyment is bound up with the peace of Jerusalem. So it ends, as I said before, "Because of the house of Jehovah our God I will seek thy good". That is the end, for the house is the place of affection.
Well now, I just finish with a few remarks on @Isaiah 62. It says, "I have set watchmen upon thy walls, Jerusalem; all the day and all the night they shall never hold their peace". Now, you may say, This brother is too active; he is too interfering. Well, that may be. A brother may be that, and do much damage, but there is the brother set on the walls here, a watchman "upon thy walls, Jerusalem"; all the day and night he shall never hold his peace. He shall *never* hold his peace. Well, you say, Why should he always be saying something? Well, I will tell you.
There is always something to speak about. If any of us were to meet another of us, we would know that there is not a day that something fresh does not come up, some sister says this or that; some brother says this or that. They are not right. Well, they have to be looked into and the watchman on the walls did not hold his peace. They say, That is not right; that must be given up. It may be irksome to hear him talking all the time about these things, but what is he there for? What is a watchdog for? To bark when the burglars come. The Lord says, They are like dumb dogs, they do not bark. Things happen and it is nothing to them, but it is a great deal to the watchmen. Why should I not be in accord with heaven? If things are wrong in my eyes, and even if I have to speak day and night about it, I will do it, even if I
{247}
have to suffer for it. You are apt to be slain if the dogs do not bark; that is in the speaking (Paul gives the word) correcting, exhorting, rebuking; "reprove ... with all longsuffering and doctrine". That is what keeps the matter right, and Jehovah gets praise. How can we have these things in our meetings, save as the watchmen do their work? They do it here. There is just one other thought in this passage in the end of verse 6 it says, "Ye that put Jehovah in remembrance, keep not silence". Ye who do that; who are the ye? "Ye that put Jehovah in remembrance", as much as to say He has forgotten; God graciously comes down to our way of thinking, "Ye that put Jehovah in remembrance". What do we do at our prayer meetings? That is what we do. We put Jehovah in remembrance, among other things. We call the attention of His mind to this, that and the other thing, that we see that only He can enter into. "Ye that put Jehovah in remembrance, keep not silence, and give him no rest". It is very wonderful to me that the Spirit of the Lord allows such statements as this, to bring God down to us; "Give him no rest", it says. Do not let Him rest. You are speaking about a man-like God; He allows himself to be spoken about in that way, to come down to our poor tiny understandings. "Give him no rest", it says, and what for? "till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth". Do not give Him any rest. Keep on, pray without ceasing, day and night, and in the prayer meetings. Do not give Him any rest until He establish. He only can establish and He is establishing. He is doing great things for us. We should be encouraged to keep on and ask Him to do these things. Do not give Him any rest until He establish and until He make Jerusalem a praise in the earth. Make it a praise; that is the saints, dear brethren, ourselves; it is collectively something for God. That is what is in mind. That
{248}
is what all these meetings are for, to encourage us to go on with our labour in the Lord, and God will establish if we give Him no rest. He will do it; however long, keep on. Give Him no rest, it says, until He establish. And then it adds, "And till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth. Jehovah hath sworn by his right hand and by the arm of his strength". You have every encouragement to give Him no rest. Keep on praying, till He establish, until things are perfected; that there is something you can say is finished. May God bless the word for His name's sake!
{249}
ASSEMBLY SERVICE
@Exodus 24: 1 - 11; @Exodus 40: 9 - 16
J.T. No doubt the letter of these scriptures is familiar to us, but perhaps their typical import is not so much understood. They bear on assembly service. The workmanship in the building of the tabernacle and all its parts, and all the details connected therewith are found in the intervening chapters, from 25 to 39. The closing verses call attention to the divine pleasure in the things seen typically in the tabernacle and its varied parts. In the antitype, the saints particularly, all coming under the view of Moses, who is typical of Christ, anointed and set in their positions and functioning in those positions, are all according to the will of God. As viewing us thus and resting in us, He is pleased with us; and under these circumstances, the cloud covering the tabernacle indicates that the Lord is pleased with the saints. Moses cannot enter into the tabernacle, and there is no need for any further commandments for the moment; all is according to God and He is pleased with us.
That is, in general, what is in mind in proposing these scriptures; and what may be noted is that the first verse of chapter 24 is a continuance of the communications of Jehovah to Moses in the preceding chapters, but the verse indicates that God would have His people near Him in an elevated sense.
A.N. Would the detail given in these chapters answer to "Look that thou make them after their pattern, which was shewed thee in the mount" (@Exodus 25: 40), and that we should answer to all that is shown?
J.T. That is the thought. Our Mediator is Christ, He only could build the tabernacle, as Moses in the type was the only one who could do so, for he alone saw the pattern.
{250}
A.N. That would answer to what we get in Hebrews; Moses as servant but Christ as Son.
J.T. Christ as Son over the house, and then it goes on to say He builded the house. In the antitype the work is Christ's, and God is pleased with the saints as brought in and set together in this way.
He begins this part of the subject in the first verse of chapter 24, as wishing that they should come near, but in an elevated sense. We do not come together as men around do outwardly, that is on the level of the world. The divine thought is that we should come together in an elevated sense. In the first verse, which is really a continuation of the previous chapter, He says to Moses, "Come up unto the Lord, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel". It is imperative that we should understand what is in the mind of God, because morally it is that the saints should come together on an elevated principle.
Ques. Why is it that in chapter 25 Moses is alone, and in chapter 40 it is Moses who could not enter? Aaron is not mentioned.
J.T. I think the meaning in chapter 40 is that we no longer need to be told what to do, and Moses represents that side. He has everything to do with the tabernacle; all was under his supervision; but now it is God, as it were, saying, 'That is all ended; what is effected is to be entirely for Me'. "A cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle". God claims it all. It is really an honour to Moses; the time has come when his service is over for the moment, in the sense of commandments, and God claims all the fruits of his work. It is a great honour to him, and this is implied in that he could not enter into the tent of meeting. In the cloud God had taken entire possession of the fruits of his labours; it was no discrepancy in Moses. It is a very great comfort for any who have part in
{251}
the service when there is no more room for you. God takes possession of all the labours of Moses.
H.H. Would that be touched in the Supper, when we enter into the assembly proper?
J.T. Yes; as we come together in assembly, the time arrives when there is no need to be told what to do. Eternity will not be marked by being told what to do. The present time is the education time, the formative time. The time comes when there is what is for God's pleasure, and this is not to be interrupted by any exhortations. What is before Him is perfect, answering to His house.
Ques. Is there any thought that Moses, the greatest man on earth, is not great enough to sustain the glory?
J.T. I think that is right. Aaron is not mentioned, as already observed, but he is not excluded. The instruction refers rather to those *represented* in Moses. The tabernacle here is the fruit of Moses ministry. If you are building a house, you wait until the workmen have finished all before you enter in to dwell there; and to use that figure, I think that is what is meant. It was no discredit to Moses, it was an honour to him for his work was done. God has no complaint to make, He says, 'I want all that'. I think that is what the tabernacle means, it is just the public side of the assembly position. In Solomon's structure it is what is for God eternally; here it is what comes under man's eye in the wilderness, but even though it be thus, God says, 'I want that, it is altogether suitable for Me'. It is in mind that we might see how that works out as we come together in assembly.
Rem. At the end of Psalm go Moses says, "Let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us ... yea, the work of our hands establish thou it".
J.T. That is right. Moses had a great idea of the work of God. His contribution to the psalms is not large, because we have to remember the books of the
{252}
Psalms are really in the service of God. They consist of many utterances put together by skilled hands for the service of God, and Moses had not a great part in it. But he speaks about the work of God, that the work of His hands might be established.
Rem. That would be characteristic of the man of God: "A prayer of Moses the man of God".
J.T. Quite so, without stating what he had done himself. He does not call attention to the tabernacle in the psalms. It is God: "Thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations". @Exodus 24 is to bring out what God's circumstances are up there. If we are to find a habitation for Him here, we must remember what are His circumstances up there. They saw that; they saw the God of Israel and what was under His feet. I think the allusion is to what would be in the tabernacle, that is, God will not be content with less than that to which He is accustomed. Love will always descend, that is what the tabernacle brings out, coming into circumstances less than the Deity is accustomed to. There was nothing under His feet in the tabernacle.
The first verse is a divine proposal. There is the position; can I proceed with the proposal? Moses understands and it says in verse 3, "Moses came and told the people all the words of the Lord, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the Lord hath said will we do". Now I think that the position is that the proposal is in verses 1 and 2, and the means of going on with the proposal is the ground of obedience. God indicates what He has in mind, but can He proceed with His mind? Am I in the way? Very often this is so; a brother is in the way in a meeting, or conditions are in the way.
Ques. What answers to this elevated place now?
J.T. It is more or less the public side of the assembly position, and Exodus is that, it is the
{253}
anointing, what comes under man's eye. God's proposal is that our comings together should be above the level of christendom. We pass others going to churches as we come out of our houses; look at their steps. Are they anointed steps? Are they dignified? Those who know and love God and have the Spirit move differently; there is a moral elevation about them. They may repair to a very humble meeting-room, for the first meeting place was an upper room; that is, a prescribed place. In the end of Luke they went to the temple, God was still graciously waiting on the Jews; but in the first chapter of the Acts they went to an upper room, showing that the assembly is in mind and God is now moving on an elevated plane. Those who saw Jesus go up were impressed by His going up. "This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven". Solomon went up to the house of the Lord; it is moral elevation, literal elevation, but there is a moral touch to it. They went to the upper room; they did not go to the temple. When brethren come together on the first day of the week it is as those who know God; they move out from their dwellings, which are called in the Psalms, "the dwellings of Jacob", where God has a place, where the children are under influence and rule, and all is in the order of the anointing; every step taken is in that way, and when they enter the upper room it is in dignity.
Ques. Would you explain what you mean by the anointing?
J.T. Paul says, "Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ ... is God". You are established with the brethren, that is the idea. Paul says, "and has anointed us": God puts His own dignity upon us. It represents the Spirit and the Spirit received as the earnest of our inheritance, but in the public effect of it, persons with the Spirit and walking in the
{254}
Spirit. If I walk in the Spirit as I leave my house, I am in dignity; I have the assembly in mind and the house of God. I want my feet to be dipped in oil; that is what is meant. There is testimony in every movement of the saints as they approach the assembly.
Ques. What is meant by "They saw God, and did eat and drink"?
J.T. It is preparatory to chapters 35 to 40, and a question of preparing God's house, but before He asks for that He takes them up to see what His circumstances are up there.
Ques. Would you tell us what it means by Moses first writing, and then telling, the people?
J.T. These verses are an indication of the intelligence that belongs to the workman. Moses is not told to do this here; it is the man himself brought into evidence. He does it, as much as to say to Jehovah, This is Your proposal, but can we proceed? He is virtually saying to God, Can we proceed with this? Is it possible, is it workable? In Ephesians it is as regards heavenly places, but in Corinthians it is in regard of what is down here. It might be said, That is very beautiful, a very fine picture, but you cannot work it out. But God intimates that you can work it out. Moses comes to the people and sets out what God says. Can it be worked out in this town? It says he "told them all the words of the Lord, and all the judgments"; he did not take anything out; and "All the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the Lord hath said will we do". If they had known themselves better they would not have said it, but the point in this matter is obedience. Without obedience you cannot work this thing out, and it is a great matter for young christians.
Rem. You get the principle in Hebrews: "He became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him", @Hebrews 5: 9.
{255}
J.T. That is the idea, to follow obedience as in this third verse. In principle, this affords workable material, and you now have material to go on with. As soon as they say, 'We will do it', Moses wrote all the words of Jehovah; as much as to say, 'You have committed yourselves to this'.
G.A. I would like to ask you to comment on what Moses did intelligently, in taking blood and sprinkling it on the book.
J.T. He had spiritual understanding. You get an illustration of this in chapter 12 of this book; he epitomises what Jehovah said as regards the passover and adds to it other thoughts, as if the Mediator makes it intelligible to the saints, and God is pleased with that. After the ministry of the new covenant, there are those present who can unfold it.
J.S. It says that Moses built an altar and twelve pillars, showing that it is workable.
J.T. It is workable on the ground of obedience. If I am not obedient, I am not material, I am standing in the way.
Ques. Would Peter have that in mind in his first epistle, "Unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ", @1 Peter 1: 2?
J.T. Yes, I think so. The committal in chapter 19 and this one are the same in principle, we have to come up to the moral elevation; we would not like to be like the churches around. Israel later asked for a king. Unless we make up our minds that things are not to be like current religion, they cannot be worked out.
E.J.S. In verse 2 it speaks of different degrees of nearness: Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and the seventy elders. Would you say what they represent?
J.T. I think it brings out what is in the mind of God as to His will, involving counsel, involving some near and some more distant. He is not obliged to
{256}
give account of His matters. We have to learn to be subject at the outset, and accept what God proposes.
A.N. Would that come in in Ezekiel? The Levites went astray in the time of Israel's departure and they could not come near, but the sons of Zadok could come near (@Ezekiel 44: 15).
J.T. Quite so; and here it is especially Moses. Moses is the mediator, which points to Christ having a unique place. There are several things mentioned in verses 4 and 5 where it says, "Moses wrote all the words of the Lord, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill ... And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the Lord". It implies there will be sacrifice; the divine will will be effected by sacrifice. There are the twelve pillars implying that God has His own number; His own counsels require certain numbers and Moses had that in mind. Everything that Moses does here is in keeping with the moment. God has His own number, and Moses says that that number must be maintained, there must be no deviation from it. Then it says, "He sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the Lord". I think the idea is that there was to be youthfulness. To bring things in a mere outward way, without freshness, would be to take on the character of what is old, to say nothing about the weakness. What God has in mind is freshness, showing that the priesthood should consist, not of old brothers exactly, but youths.
H.B. Why did David number the Levites from twenty years old and upward?
J.T. The Levites were presented to Jehovah from thirty years old and upward, and in @Numbers 8 the age is reduced to twenty-five, which would greatly add to the numbers; it suggests that the nearer we get to God the more He loves us. They are brought
{257}
near to be presented to Jehovah, and He says, 'I like them, I would like more of them' In the days of David the age was reduced another five years, to twenty years, and that gives many more still, as if God would say, 'I like young people in this capacity', that is, in levitical capacity. That is going on today, God is reducing the number and bringing all the young into assembly service.
-.F. Does that answer to Colossians?
J.T. That is the thought. The new man in Colossians is youthful and fresh. I think the stress is on the word 'youth', the energy of life, newness of life. This is the first covenant, of course, literally, but the second in principle; Moses stresses that. It says in verse 8, "Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the Lord hath made with you concerning all these words", His words and theirs. Then you find a great volume of blood, which ought to make us very humble, speaking of the blood of Jesus and indicating that the death of Christ is a testimony to love, and love in obedience. The Lord's saying, "This is my blood, that of the new covenant", is to call attention to it. As He handed them the cup, He says, "Drink ye all of it"; each one of them was to drink out of it; there was plenty of it. One is glad if there is enough in one cup for a large company. The Lord says, "Drink ye all of it", and they all drank of it. It is a testimony to love, that is the idea.
Ques. You suggested that this is typical; would @Acts 1 and 2 bring this out?
J.T. I think so; the public position was the point in @Acts 2. John builds inwards, and so does Paul; he takes us inside. But at Pentecost we have the public position, the anointing. The Holy Spirit is said to have come upon *them* in the form of cloven tongues of fire, and they all began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them to speak forth; it is
{258}
speaking forth. After the conversion of the three thousand, you have described throughout the chapter who they were and what they were doing. They continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine, meaning they were obedient, and the service of God can now be carried on by willing and obedient people.
Rem. I would like to refer to the question as to the first and second covenant.
J.T. You cannot understand the remaining chapters of this book without understanding this chapter, because it is a question of the love of God brought in as flowing through the death of Christ, and shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit. If God has that material, He can proceed with the tabernacle and the service. So that after we get the blood of the covenant and all leading up to it, there is the idea of going up, as if we can proceed in the service now. It says in verse 9, "Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness. And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink". It is wonderful that they are called nobles there, the higher you go the more ennobled you are.
Rem. We would enter into this after the Supper.
J.T. That is the idea exactly.
H.H. Going up to the mount of Olives after singing a hymn would correspond to this.
J.T. That is the thought, I think. After the Lord had told them about the covenant, then they sang a hymn and went to the mount of Olives.
A.N. Drawing near to God. It is workable; it is a delight to God.
J.T. That is what you come to in these last days. God has shown that it is workable; what they had at Pentecost is workable. I think that it is so; it is of
{259}
great moment, because in the minds of many it is not workable. As they said in Nehemiah's day, "Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall". The locusts have no king, it says, and yet the thing is workable, it does not break down. The thing goes on; Satan attacks and alas, there are losses, but the thing is workable on the ground of obedience.
A.N. In Ezekiel, the first thirty-nine chapters deal with evil, then we get the house, its size, its chambers and so on.
J.T. That is right; and the prophet is taken to a high mountain, to the mount of God, to see what there was. He saw the frame of a city, and then he comes near to it. God is not giving that view without intending to carry it through. The sons of Zadok are a type of those who kept God's covenant in a dark day, and that is our day. God will bring things through with men like that.
Ques. Do you think that if we appreciated the covenant more, we should be like the disciples who went to the mount of Olives?
J.T. The Lord stresses what the covenant was, and then they sang a hymn. It does not say that He did, nor that He told them to do it; but the effect of what He said to them sets them free in their spirit, and then they move out to the mount of Olives.
J.S. We should give due place to the covenant before going up. In @Song of Songs 3 we get, "Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense ... ?".
J.T. So that, as we were remarking, the Lord had told them about the covenant, and when they had sung a hymn they went to the mount of Olives, moving out from the position where the Supper applied into a realm where there is no opposition, where it is all spiritual. Going up means going into the realm of spirituality.
{260}
In the latter part of verse 10 the allusion is to the circumstances that belong to God in His own sphere. The tabernacle was to have no flooring but the sand of the desert. Jehovah was to travel that way with them in love, and He says to them in effect, 'I am coming down to be with you'; love will always do that. He has come into our circumstances in love. His circumstances up there are better than we can afford down here in the wilderness. The point is, what love will do, showing the lengths to which God will go in order to be with His people.
Ques. If God is to walk with us, will He show what conditions are suitable?
J.T. That is what comes out in chapter 25.
Whilst love will come down to be with us, yet it will come down on its own terms, and they are better terms than any that we can supply. The next chapter shows love's terms, and what is required. The order of the tabernacle is a question of God's terms in order to be with us.
Ques. I would like a little help on the point of Moses's seeing God. He had already seen Him in the bush.
J.T. It is to bring out all that. The bush indicates a lowly position, a thorn bush. To think that God would go into such circumstances was a great stoop.
"I am come down", He says; He would have us to understand that He is stooping in love. He has His own terms of love and they are the best. It is for us to submit to them; hence there is the need of obedience, and it is this that underlies all that follows. "By sanctification of the Spirit, unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ", @1 Peter 1: 2.
He gives the Holy Spirit to those who obey Him, and that is the secret of the workability of all this.
L.D.M. Do you think this chapter works out on kingdom lines?
{261}
J.T. That is right; the kingdom brings in subjection and subdues us, so that if we do not submit ourselves to the terms of the kingdom, we shall have no part in the house. Chapter 25 brings out a wonderful amount of material, which is His own work in us; the saints viewed as subjects of His work by the obedience that accepts the position.
When you come to the last scripture we read, it says at the end of chapter 39, "Moses saw all the work, and behold, they had done it as Jehovah had commanded-so had they done it; and Moses blessed them". Then God speaks again in chapter 40: 9 and says, "And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is in it, and shalt hallow it, and all its utensils; and it shall be holy". That direction continues to the end of verse 16, and from there to the end of verse 33 we have the items of the tabernacle, each set in its place and functioning. This is a most important part of the instructions for the saints to understand if we are to be in our place in the local assembly or in the assembly as a whole. I am not idle or negligent; God has assigned me a place and I am functioning in it. That is what is conveyed in these verses. Then in verse 34 it says, "And the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle".
Ques. Does @Ezekiel 43: 2 give the link with @Exodus 24, they saw the God of Israel?
J.T. I think it does. There is another thing in Ezekiel that we do not get here, a man stood beside him. You are made restful in the presence of Christ as Man beside you.
J.McB. Everyone should function in a spiritual way. Is this the anointing?
J.T. The anointing is to be dignified by us, we are publicly suitable to God. As you leave your house with your wife and children it is there too; you are not going about like worldly people, you come into
{262}
the assembly in dignity. The footsteps of the flock enter into that, and it is delightful to God. There are notices to be given out and it all has to be done in dignity. The public position is seen in the anointing. The ark is set in its place and all are functioning, every item, and every christian is doing what he should do. He has his place to fill; let him see that he fills it in dignity. God is thus pleased with us.
Ques. Have we left enough room after the Supper for the new covenant? Should the volume of the blood be contemplated?
J.T. In @Mark 14 the Lord dwelt on the covenant before they sang a hymn and before they moved out. Of course this movement with us is entirely a spiritual one, where the covenant is stressed, the movement then follows; that is the order, I think. I do not like a hymn to the Father or giving thanks to the Father, immediately after the Lord's supper is finished. It is well to dwell on that which sets us free, "perfect love casts out fear". Another great difficulty one finds is that when we do begin to speak to the Father someone leads us back again. That is confusion. When there has been a direct lead to the Father, we should not go back, we should proceed on the line we are led on, go up by the gates. The thing is to go right in; if someone speaks to the Father in the spirit of adoption, the thing is to go on that line, we are on high ground and should keep to that. There is a great deal in Ezekiel about the high level, seven steps and eight steps, high levels.
Ques. Is it the principle of ascension?
J.T. Quite so. In the corresponding position in Ezekiel, there was liberty to move and to keep on the high level; we go up together. Moses went up here alone, but he always has that distinction. With regard to our hymns after the Supper, the thing is to be intelligent and go forward. It is the spirit of adoption, and the thing is to move on those lines.
{263}
This position is really for intelligent persons. The apostle in Corinthians says, as it were, I give you credit for being intelligent. We ought to be intelligent, the assembly is composed of intelligent persons; they know what to do.
Rem. Sometimes the Father is addressed, and then the Lord, in the same thanksgiving.
J.T. Well, the Father is God, of course. It is confusion when this is done.
F.I. In verse 35, Moses could not enter. The Mediator does not come in, the work is finished.
J.T. That is right; His work is finished, and the Lord knows that well. He will now take another line with us. God is teaching us, it is a refining time, "That ye may judge of and approve the things that are more excellent". He has indicated something great, and the thing is to go on with that, for that will please Him. We have to go to @2 Chronicles 5 to get the full thought of the assembly, and there you have the priests ministering. We are told that they could not enter; that is to bring out that official service ceases. It is now a question of relationship in the family. God recognises the official position up to a point, but now He says, 'I love you because of what you are, you are answering to My thoughts, and I want you in that connection in relation to My eternal counsel'. God impresses us with what we are to Him in relation to His eternal counsel.
F.A.W. In @Exodus 24 Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu went up, and they saw God and did eat and drink. In chapter 40 the cloud covered the tent of meeting. What would be the difference as to these thoughts at the present time?
J.T. In going up, we do not move physically, of course, but it is a question of the attitude of mind, and that covers the whole instruction in Exodus. It indicates people who are outside the world, morally above it, and that governs the whole section of Exodus
{264}
up to the end. It enters into this position in the tabernacle we are all set together in this way and are functioning, and God delights in us. I do not say we have the eternal thoughts of God in Exodus, but it is the public position of the assembly before God showing how He is pleased with His people. God would say, 'Whatever you may think of them, I want them, they belong to Me. They have no status at all, religiously, but they suit Me. I want all of them'. He covers the position with a cloud and with glory, He is inside as well as outside. The general thought is elevation and worship, but God is taking possession of the whole matter and showing that He wants us.
Ques. As to the public side, in the latter part of Numbers we get the carrying of the tabernacle, putting it up and taking it down. Would that come in as to our coming to the meeting and leaving it?
J.T. Just so; when we leave the meeting we are like a heavenly people, and our faces ought to shine. It is a great thing in the thoughts of God at the present time as to what His people are publicly. See them in the hotels, for instance, they are different from the world. That is a very great deal to God.
{265}
DIVINE CLOTHING
@John 19: 4, 5, 23, 24; @2 Corinthians 5: 3; @Jonah 3: 3 - 10; @Luke 15: 22
These scriptures speak about clothing, and it is in mind to speak of clothing as it enters into the truth of the gospel. It has a wider bearing, but the intent now is to confine what is to be said to the gospel. The short verse in 2 Corinthians warns us that, although we may be clothed from our own point of view, the judgment of God will bring to light that we may be naked, as it is said, "If indeed being also clothed we shall not be found naked". I read in @John 19 to call attention first to certain clothing that our Saviour wore, which was put on Him in derision, and then, secondly, to His own clothes, some of which were parted into four parts, but lots cast for the body-coat.
Now as to the first, you will observe that Pilate calls attention to Christ as garbed in a purple robe, crowned too with a crown of thorns. I dwell on this so as to make what I have in mind clear, believing that it foreshadowed what is now historical in the testimony of God, that many who call attention to Him clothe Him with garments of their own making. One could mention some of these garbs which were never intended by God to be worn by Christ. It was never intended that He should be presented to men with such clothes, a purple robe and a crown of thorns, both provided by His enemies. Pilate did not plait the crown of thorns, but he accepted Christ with it, and with the purple robe put on Him. He had Christ before Him with it and with the purple robe put on Him. He had already scourged Him, and then brought Him forth robed in this way.
Now I mention all this lest there may be those here who have been accustomed to hear of Christ as
{266}
clothed with other garments than those that are properly His own. We may be sure that what is presented to us in this way will affect us, and the more we are affected by clothes put upon Christ, not His own, the more defective will our christianity be. Let it be-to make is very pronounced-a Mohammedan Christ; for that apostate system does not wholly repudiate Him; but what a Christ! What a misconception of Christ they present! The gospel is the gospel of God, beloved friends, "concerning his Son (come of David's seed according to flesh, marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead)". There can be no question as to His Person as presented in the gospel, no suggestion of human-made clothes being put on Him. It is the Christ of God, the Son of God, that is presented, as the apostle Paul says, "The Son of God ... has been preached by us among you (by me and Silvanus and Timotheus)"-a threefold witness, presented at Corinth, of His glorious Person!
How utterly foreign to Christ were the crown of thorns and the purple robe, put on Him derisively by His enemies! The apostle Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus would never robe Him thus; they would present the glorious Person free from all mere human thoughts. And then we see the Roman or the Anglican presentation of Christ, and so with many other denominations. Not that I am attacking any religious system, but we want the Christ of God in the gospel if we are to be rightly formed and rightly fitted for the divine purpose as to us. It must be the Christ of God as He is presented to us by the Holy Spirit in the Scriptures.
Now think of the incongruity of a man scourging the Saviour and then presenting Him in this garb! Think of what is behind it! He said, "Behold the man!" and yet he scourged Him. Is it not possible, beloved friends, that Christ is being presented in
{267}
similar circumstances? Persons may scourge Him in the sense of persecuting and detracting from His Person or His doctrine. The Lord Jesus feels these things; and yet such men still stand up and present Christ. It is their own Christ, their own clothing they put on Him, and I am speaking thus so that everyone here may know that God has His Christ in the gospel. It is that Christ I seek to present; the "Son of God ... Jesus Christ our Lord", marked out. It says, "marked out Son of God"; not only by the voice from heaven, which proclaimed Him at the Jordan and on the mount of transfiguration, but also marked out distinctly in power by the resurrection from among the dead. That is the Christ whom God presents in the gospel.
Then there is another thing. The persons who crucified Him, evidently four soldiers, parted His garments among them. These were not the garments put on Him derisively; they were His own garments, those He wore in the days of His flesh. That is another side, and there may be someone here who has clothed Him in his mind with some of those four parts. One of those parts can never present a whole Christ. Such persons can never have a whole Christ. No sect can rightly present the Christ of God. I am not saying that persons in it may not, but the very idea of a sect is incongruous in regard to the testimony of God. The suggestion here is that the very murderers of Christ, the crucifiers, those who officially put Him to death, divided His garments. What is the suggestion? It is that His garments are taken on, and yet they crucify Him; taking on the garments of One who is only thought worthy of a gibbet; think of the incongruity of that! There are four parts; to each soldier a part. Each soldier as he wore that part would present some little thought of Christ, but underneath that part there was the state in the man which would drive the nails into His hands! Will that
{268}
garment suffice when God begins to reckon with men? No! It will not. Anyone trusting to a garment like that will be found naked.
It may be there is someone here who is trusting to a part of Christ. You need a whole Christ. The whole Christ of God is the subject of testimony, and no less than that. Anyone trusting in less than that, I warn you, will be found naked although you may think you are clothed. There are those who believe in Christ, and talk about Him, who do not believe in His deity. No one can be saved who does not believe in the deity of Christ. There are those who do not believe in the necessity for the blood as in the atonement. Such a Christ will not save you; without blood-shedding there is no remission.
Well, you say, what about the body-coat? It was woven throughout, it was not parted. Surely they have a whole Christ! But have they? There is a system that, professedly, accepts every word in the Bible as inspired. They believe in every doctrine of Scripture professedly. There is a system like that, the greatest system numerically and influentially; but what is underneath this whole Christ that they talk about? Is it love for Christ? I do not think so. I think it suits them to take the whole matter on, as if to be exclusive. It is just man; it is just the same sort of spirit as the one who has got a fourth part of the clothing. It suits that system to make much of the clothing of Christ, according to what He was here, and to profess to have a whole Christ and a whole christianity, to have God, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit; and yet there is the absence of all that characterises true christianity.
If there is anyone here in such a system I warn you: do not trust in that. The gospel presents righteousness, not a mere profession; it is not mere external garments, however seemingly they are like Christ; the gospel brings righteousness. "Righteousness
{269}
of God is manifested ... towards all, and upon all those who believe". It is not a question of a mere outward garment, there must be righteousness. And then not only that, it is Christ in heaven that is presented in the gospel. It is not simply Christ as He was here after the flesh, but Christ who died for our sins and who was raised again by the power of God for our justification who now is seated at God's right hand in heaven. It is the Christ of God in heaven that is presented in the gospel, and that is what the best robe means-the only garment that will stand and will prevent us from being naked.
Now that is what I want to come to. In Corinthians the solemn question is raised, "If indeed being also clothed we shall not be found naked". This word is for anyone here who may have been trusting in any one of these four parts of the Lord's clothing, or even in the whole body-coat, *without righteousness*. You will be found naked. You may be able to say to the Lord, "Thou hast taught in our streets" and "Have we not ... through *thy* name cast out demons ... ?". But He will have to say, "I never knew you". Could anything be more terrible at the last moment, at the final assize, when the judge will have to say that to you? For with all your mere religious clothing you have not the righteousness of God which is by faith; you have not appropriated the blood of Jesus; you have not really repented towards God. How terrible it will be to hear Him say to you, "I never knew you"! How urgent it is, beloved friends, that you should get the right kind of clothing! The divinely-provided clothing for salvation, and for eternal glory, too. For the present time is peculiarly the time of salvation: that the elect "may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory". That is a wonderful touch for the last days; it is found in @2 Timothy 2: 10.
Jonah is to call attention to repentance. That is
{270}
the crucial matter; that is what we shrink from. What a sorrowful reflection, dear friends, that with the myriads of nominal christians, how little the idea of repentance towards God is understood. There are those going about in christendom in groups, who are enlarging on repentance and confession *to men*, but the gospel carries with it the idea of repentance *towards God*. That is the first thing; it is repentance towards God. No other repentance, no other confession has any moral virtue in it. Not that confession to one another is not right, but confession towards God is the *first* thing, as the man who smote upon his breast began his spiritual career saying, "God, have compassion on me". It is no question of *sharing*, as they call it, with a fellow man. The first thing is repentance towards God, getting alone with God, and having matters out with God who knows you. "O God, have compassion on me, the sinner", not a sinner, but *the* sinner, as if there were not another; and in truth that is how you feel when the Spirit of God brings home to you the sense of sin.
And so this remarkable book of Jonah fits in here in a striking way, and we can understand how the enemy in what is called modernism seeks to get rid of this book of Jonah. I have seen a large volume, giving an account of the research of certain great leaders in religion in which they triumphantly say that they have found the truth of the death and resurrection and ascension of the Lord Jesus Christ to be established by fact; and alongside of that they deny the authenticity of the book of Jonah. They would seek to get rid of a wonderful part of scripture wherein God has given us an illustration and foreshadowing of the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ; and not only so, but it is a wonderful witness to the power of the testimony of God in bringing down the great king of Nineveh and the Ninevites, even down to the dust of repentance. It is one of the finest pieces of scripture
{271}
for these latter days. The enemy of our souls, through modernism, would endeavour to get rid of this precious little book of four short chapters.
I am speaking of the third chapter particularly, and what comes out is that this servant of God, after being raised from the dead, as it were, is sent to Nineveh, and we are told he spoke the word of Jehovah. He entered into this great city Nineveh and said, "Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!". Jonah preached. That was enough; the Spirit of God was there to make the word effective. We have prayed for this meeting, the brethren and myself, that the Spirit of God might be with us. The Spirit of God is down here, a divine Person on earth, who particularly is present at such meetings as this, and as the preaching proceeds, He operates in consciences and hearts, and that is what happened at Nineveh. Men were going about their business, as usual, in that great city, but they were arrested by this remarkable testimony of Jonah, and men generally began to move in repentance, and the king began to move. What a visitation for that city of Nineveh, when God sent His servant to it! His Spirit also was present with the preacher to effect conviction of sin in the Ninevites. It was a general matter, the wind was blowing, the wind of conviction, the irresistible power of the Spirit of God was operating, and men were brought down. It was a real thing, a real feeling of conviction of sin before God, and not only so, but they turned from their wicked works.
Let no one think that if he gets light into his soul he can go on as before; that is not conversion. Do not talk about yourself as a convert if you only believe the terms of the gospel, without any change in your life. That is not conversion. These men gave up their wicked deeds, we are told, and put on sackcloth. Nineveh was a large city; think of the amount of sackcloth needed! The infidel might say, Impossible!
{272}
But nothing is impossible with God, and certainly not spiritually; sackcloth represents the inward repentant attitude of mind of the sinner, and there might be sackcloth therefore to cover every man in Nineveh. But one has marvelled at it, that we should have this remarkable kind of material called sackcloth in such quantity in Nineveh, so that every man could clothe himself in it. What does it mean? It means that every person, to a man, turned to God and if there is anybody here like the Ninevites going on in sin, will they not come to God? It is a terrible time of sin in this present day; the world is seething in it. The wicked woman that flatters with her mouth is ready to entice you into sin; it is a wicked world.
There may be some here who are going on in it, and you have turned in here for some reason, and God would turn your attention to the sackcloth here, right by you. It is as if God would say, 'I will allow you to wear it'. It is said of the Lamb's wife that "it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and pure"! God has granted to men now that they can wear this sackcloth. It is available to them spiritually. God has opened the door of repentance to the gentiles. The time will come when there will be none: I mean to say, none that God recognises. For instance, Esau did not find any; he found no place for repentance. How terrible it will be if the day of judgment comes before you have taken on this garb of sackcloth, when there will be no moral value in it. God will shut the door for ever, when instead of the gospel He will send a strong delusion to men that they should believe a lie. Why? Because they have not received the love of the truth! Oh, I do appeal to you-"the love of the truth"! Because a lie is so prevalent, and men are believing it, God is going to send it to them. Do not wait for that time, embrace the truth *now*, repent, and believe the gospel.
{273}
That is the first word the Lord Jesus said in His preaching according to Mark. The Lord stands up and says, "The time is fulfilled ... repent and believe in the glad tidings". It is not simply believe it, but believe *in* it; that is, take it on, and search it out, and see how much there is in it. If you believe in it, you will find that you love the truth more and more. A lover of truth is a person who looks into the great gospel epistle, Romans; it is the truth set out in the most orderly way to meet the conscience and heart of a repentant sinner, and every page of it induces love of the truth.
You say, That is exactly what I want, that fits me, and I love it. The gospel implies the truth about myself, and the truth about God. And what is the truth about myself? Romans points out in a most convincing way the truth about man. The first chapter is the human race: the whole human race is under review, and the chapter shows, too, what it was from the outset. The second chapter is the Greek and the Jew, and the third chapter is that all are brought in guilty before God. Guilty! It is like a court; God being infinitely fair, it says in the psalm, "Jehovah looked down from the heavens upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God", and He did not find any, so that all are brought in guilty.
Do you love the truth? If you are an honest man or woman you do. We accept it as the divine judgment about ourselves, and we say we are utterly hopeless without redemption, and so God introduces redemption, and how beautiful it is in the end of chapter 3. He says the righteousness of God is revealed on the principle of faith, and he speaks of "the redemption which is in Christ Jesus ... that he should be just, and justify him that is of the faith of Jesus", @Romans 3: 24 - 26. Do you not love that truth? Is there anyone here that does not love the truth? The day is
{274}
shortly coming when men will believe a he; a lie will be sent and they will believe it. It is a question of the love of the truth now, and I appeal to you as to the truth. And so these Ninevites all acknowledged the truth; the sackcloth was there and they all wore it; that is the garment to wear in drawing near to God. It is the garment that faith loves, it is repentance towards God; you hold nothing back.
Now I come to @Luke 15. What appears there is not simply a repentant sinner who repents historically once and for all, it is the repenting sinner. The more spiritual you are as a believer in Christ the more you repent. It is a *continuous* thing, and history is made in heaven every moment by repenting sinners. There is a joy made there. Heaven has delight in repentance as a moral quality down here where sin is. And the more we repent the more we come into the light and the blessedness of the gospel, and love it. So I read that well-known verse telling us of how the father of the prodigal received his returning son, and how he directed his bondmen in regard of him. He does not ask the son to put on the best robe. There are robes that we must provide ourselves, and put on, but in regard to this great robe that the gospel proposes, it is put on by others. It is but a figure, I know; but a figure is a figure, and suggests something; and one thing this figure certainly suggests is that it is the very best of the wardrobe of God and really means how heaven regards you.
Would you not like to know as you sit there how heaven regards you? What does it matter how others regard you? How does heaven regard you? I look up to heaven, and I know how heaven regards me, as one clothed with Christ; not the Christ that was here only, it is the Christ that is up there. That is how heaven regards the Christian. The bondmen are told to put that on the prodigal. It is the divine thought, the mind of heaven, brought forth, and put
{275}
on the returning prodigal. If there is one here tonight who will stand and say, 'I am a repenting sinner'; if there is one like that man who went into the temple and said, "God, have compassion on me, the sinner", heaven is thinking about him. There is history being made there as he stands and makes his confession; he is now regarded in a new light before God; and we would clothe you with the very best thoughts we know of, and these are Christ as He is now in heaven. The Holy Spirit is here to bring out what is there and to clothe you with it. If you make a confession this instant heaven changes its mind about you; it looks on you differently, and so do we.
Perhaps we Christians do not know very much about the best robe, and we may not, in our thoughts, robe you as well as you should be robed; but heaven knows. One of the finest thoughts that you can take into your soul is the attitude of heaven towards you as a repenting sinner. The prodigal returned and said, "I have sinned against heaven and before thee. I am no longer worthy to be called thy son", but the father said, "Bring out the best robe". If there is anyone ready to confess his guilt and to believe in Christ, let us Christians be ready to put the best thoughts on him, and give him to understand that we are taking account of him, and clothe him according to heaven's best thoughts. That is the idea. It is no question of a literal robe, these things are spiritual, and it is bringing forth what is spiritual; it is putting upon the returning sinner the very best thoughts of heaven, so that you go up there as ennobled, entirely suitable to the place. The thief on the cross illustrates it. The Lord said, "Today shalt thou be with me in paradise". As if the Lord says, 'I will not be ashamed of you up there', for the best thoughts of heaven enshroud the returning prodigal. It is a question of what he takes in, what he understands, what he is capable of. He is a son in the house, where the music and the
{276}
dancing are, he is clothed with the best robe, and he will never be found naked; it is the best robe of heaven.
May God help you to receive "the implanted word, which is able to save your souls", @James 1: 21.

BRIEF REVISED NOTES OF A CARE MEETING
*Notes of a Care Meeting with Mr. James Taylor arising out of a matter in which a sister living in 'A' married one not walking with us, although known to be a believer, and absented herself from the meeting at 'A' for a period of some twelve months*.
Enquiries were made as to her whereabouts and she was subsequently found to be living in 'B'. Individual brethren at 'A' endeavoured to get into touch with the sister but their letters were ignored.
The brothers in care at 'A' decided to announce to the saints that having absented herself from the breaking of bread before leaving 'A' and being apparently unapproachable by any of the brethren, she could no longer be considered in fellowship. It was considered unnecessary to have an assembly meeting, as this was regarded, not as the case of a "wicked person", but rather that of a weak soul, not having faith to go on in a path in which she was never established.
The brothers at 'B' felt that the Lord would lay on *them* the responsibility of dealing with the case in accord with the principle laid down in @2 Samuel 20. Having finally left 'A' and settled in 'B', the sister was now within their gates, like Sheba the son of Bichri in going to Abel, where the people of that city dealt with him effectively. This was duly communicated to the brothers at 'A'.
At the meeting at 'B' with our beloved brother he pointed out that the matter resolved itself into a question of remissness on the part of the brothers at 'A' and at 'B'.
The brothers at 'A' failed in allowing the sister to slip away lawlessly, and also in the brothers taking it upon themselves to settle the matter, whilst the brothers at 'B' failed in their inability to see the sister. No judgment had been arrived at in either
{278}
meeting, hence it cannot be said, "God has judged your judgment upon her", @Revelation 18:20. Heaven's judgment ought to be reflected here. No judgment had been effected in either meeting for heaven to record. There ought to be a definite judgment which heaven can record.
Ques. Do you mean every such matter needs an assembly meeting to settle it?
J.T. It would seem so. Saul and the Amalekites is a test case. To the natural mind Saul did very well, but to the divine mind he did ill (@1 Samuel 15). Self-will is as iniquity and idolatry.
Rem. We think the Lord has brought this matter to our door, and that it is therefore our responsibility.
J.T. The conscience of the assembly should correspond with the mind Of heaven. Records should be kept. It seems to be an indictment against 'A' and 'B'. A great length Of time elapsed between the marriage and the time the assembly was aware Of the fact. The responsibility is in 'B' to deal with the matter. The first step would be for 'B' to communicate with 'A' confessing *their* remissness in the matter, and to see the sister, unless she refuses to be seen, which so far she has not done. Someone should be able to have access to her.
Ques. Should the sister be approached personally, or through her husband?
J.T. If you know the husband, approach her through him. He, being a christian, you might say that there is a matter of discipline in the house of God. Something might come out of it for him. The sister might be more ready to receive help now than at the time.
These cases are permeating the meetings; some are designated as 'wicked persons', and others are not. The more these matters are looked into, the more likely it is that things will come to light, and we shall probably find that they are all wicked persons.
{279}
Ques. How would @Jude 22, 23 fit in, "Of some ... making a difference ..."?
J.T. There are grades of evil the same as there are grades of good. The Lord speaks Of few stripes Or many. This passage (Jude) contemplates a person already dealt with. That is not the case here; you have not got in touch with her. If a person is allowed to slip away without investigation, their real state may never be disclosed. According to @Leviticus 4, if the matter is brought to the sister's notice, she is expected to own it. As proceedings are instituted, more may be discovered than is known at the time. The lesson we all ought to see is that this sister is guilty of turning away from the truth and marrying not in the Lord.
'A' should have transferred the whole Of the facts to 'B'. 'A's' attitude is the first point to be dealt with. Nothing has been done by them which deserves any recognition at all. They are not with heaven in the matter; the assembly's conscience is not in it. No judgment has been placed On the consciences of the saints at 'A' Or 'B'.
Rem. We cannot admit that she is other than a *lawless* person, not just weak.
J.T. She can never be in heaven's eyes what she was before she broke bread, never! She has now had soul history. Our consciences are low in such matters. Heaven has had a judgment about the sister, but the assembly is not in it.
Rem. Ezra says that all came up from Babylon unto Jerusalem. There is no mention of weak persons.
J.T. There is no case Of withdrawal that does not necessitate an assembly meeting.
Rem. There has recently been a case Of withdrawal where the person concerned wrote a letter Of withdrawal, so-called, and no assembly meeting was thought necessary.
J.T. It is making too light of a person turning their back on the assembly. There is will at work.
{280}
In the case of Saul there is an increase in the magnitude of the sin.
Ques. Would I as an individual be adequate to judge whether I could continue walking with the company? Is it not a question of what the assembly does?
J.T. A person who neglects to hear the assembly is guilty. A person may not think much of the assembly beyond an ordinary sect, though seeking the truth; but to such a one, as Nathanael, Philip would say, "Come and see". Is Nathanael now in a position to judge Christ, or Christ to judge him? Jesus was taking account of Nathanael as he came, and said, "Behold one truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile". It is a question of the state of the soul. Had Nathanael turned away after months, or even years, as if to say, I see nothing in it, it would be profanity. The Lord is bringing this matter up so that we might have the thought of the assembly in our minds, an anointed thought. Persons writing so-called letters of withdrawal have no idea what they are doing. It is a serious matter in heaven.
Rem. One knows of a case in which a sister absented herself from the meeting for about three years. The brethren are now concerned as to the matter.
J.T. @Numbers 9:13: "A man that is clean, and is not on a journey, and forbeareth to hold the passover, that soul shall be cut off from among his peoples", and that after two months. The Lord would have the assembly respected; what is anointed must not be treated profanely.
Ques. Are not telephone conversations between brothers a snare? Is it dignified?
J.T. It is helpful if we set on the principle that the assembly is a dignified anointed vessel. Ignorance on the part of the one who withdraws is not to be regarded.
{281}
Ques. Would the Lord use every assembly meeting to cause the others to fear?
J.T. Quite so.
There are three scriptures suggesting withdrawal. In 2 Thessalonians, in the sense of shrinking, which must be borne in mind; also in 2 Timothy and @Romans 16: 17. In 2 Thessalonians the person is walking disorderly. Proceedings are immediately instituted, and this may reveal something more. The Lord would help us to see that the assembly is never forced to the wall.
Rem. It is often made an excuse that the person has married a believer.
J.T. That the man is a christian in the ordinary sense has nothing to do with the matter. He may be in an evil association. "In the Lord" means more than this.
Ques. Would it be wise for brethren from 'B' to meet the brothers from 'A' and discuss the matter?
J.T. Yes; better than writing. It may look like a hopeless case, but no assembly judgment has yet been arrived at. Experience has shown that after an assembly meeting the Lord is pleased with us, and we often have better meetings. Ananias and Sapphira is a case in point: there were immediate results. Peter, as having to deal with the matter, comes in for special honour (@Acts 5: 15), the shadow of Peter healed the people. 'B' should make a claim that they are taking the matter up as being responsible, but should endeavour to get 'A' to be with them in it.
Rem. The question is often raised as to how we should treat those who have been withdrawn from when meeting them in the street, for instance.
J.T. If a person has been withdrawn from, John says, "Neither bid him God speed". It is a very grave case, but there would be the principle of respect to him as God's creature. It says of Ananias and Sapphira that the young men carried them out and
{282}
*buried* them. It is a question of respect to God's creatures. Formally acknowledging a person in the street does not bring in a matter of fellowship. Priestly intelligence is needed. The priest knows what to do, and would never be baffled. There is the case of a man and his wife; the husband cannot ignore other engagements he is committed to. In the case of a son, too, you would not turn him out of the house, but would have priestly discernment and see that the son did not defile the household. Some cases would require exclusion from the family.
{283}
THE GREATNESS OF THE PEOPLE OF GOD
@Luke 1: 32, 33; @Genesis 21: 22; @Genesis 23: 6; @Genesis 26: 12, 13; @Joshua 4: 14; @2 Samuel 3: 1; @2 Samuel 5: 10
I have in mind, dear brethren, to speak about greatness, but not greatness in the sense in which Babylon was great, worldly greatness, but greatness as it works out in the people of God, as it works out divinely.
I begin with Christ and I hope to finish with Christ, that Christ may be in our minds throughout, for it is in Him the thought is fully seen. But whether it be in Christ or in the saints it is divine greatness, not exactly divine greatness in the sense of the abstract greatness of God, as God; but divine greatness working out in Man and in men. So the thought, I believe, is clearly set out in the word of Gabriel, the angel, in this first chapter of Luke, "*He* shall be great". That is alluding to Jesus. If he were speaking of His deity alone, of course, he would say, 'He is great'. There is no change in that, but the angel says, "*He* shall be great". Luke presents the truth from this side. John begins with what is there: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God". That is enough as to greatness. It adds, "All things received being through him, and without him not one thing received being which has received being", @John 1: 3. But he asserts His deity, the deity of Christ, at the outset, an important matter as to the place his ministry has. It fits in with the time of pretension, and there can be no mincing of matters or questioning or disputing in his plain assertion of a fact, that the Lord Jesus was in the beginning of everything, whatever there was a beginning of, and that He was there as God. He had to do with the beginning. There will be no question about that in
{284}
any of our minds because if there be even a question as to it we shall slip under the power of the devil in one way or another. There can be no question about that. If John were to speak in the midst of the apostasy, he would say, There can be no conversation between you and me unless you accept this, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God". That must be the basis of all our conversation. That is what the apostle John would say; that is what each one who loves Jesus would say, without any hesitation whatever. We cannot even have conversation unless we start on this point, the beautiful truth of the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is there: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God". Luke, however, assumes that truth, for he begins with the very same title as John begins with, "the Word"; he speaks of those who were "eye-witnesses of and attendants on the Word". That is what is marked down here in men, those who were eye-witnesses of and attendants on Him as Man. That could not be said of Jesus as John presented Him at the beginning. It was the inscrutableness of Deity then: the Word was with God, and the Word was God, and "No one has seen God at any time", while Luke is presenting God before men's eyes. "Eyewitnesses of and attendants on the Word" are the ones to listen to.
And so we have Gabriel conversing with the virgin Mary. Luke alone gives us this supreme incident, and in the conversation Gabriel says, speaking of Jesus, "*He* shall be great". 'He' is emphatic, as if to say, That is the One to think of. It is as if the angel said, If you think of greatness eliminate from your mind all the great wonders of the world: "*He* shall be great". So that our minds are directed to that Person; not 'He is great'; I have been speaking of that, but "*He* shall be great", and that "shall", future tense,
{285}
implies that there will be the working out of personal and moral greatness in this Babe. He is called Jesus "Thou shalt call his name Jesus", not "for *he* shall save his people" here; it is just the Person, the Man.
"Thou shalt call his name Jesus". That is how He is to be known; that Name is to go through; so that "at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of heavenly and earthly and infernal beings", @Philippians 2: 10. The glory of God is upon Him. That is the Person, the Man: "Thou shalt call his name Jesus". He shall be great. Indeed, there can be no mistake about it; whatever men can do or say, He shall be great. The more they do against Him, the more the greatness shines, for, as was recorded by the same writer, the brethren together in prayer at Jerusalem told the Lord about the combination that was gathered together in that city: Pontius Pilate, and the elders of Jerusalem.
They were all there to do whatever God's counsel had determined, and they did it; they murdered Christ. It was in the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, but they did it: with wicked hands they crucified and slew Him; wicked hands. How many there are today in the world! Who can count them? But they are specified there. Wicked hands nailed those precious hands of Jesus to the cross.
Well, to get our minds on the right thought, that is what Gabriel says, "*He* shall be great, and shall be called Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give him the throne of David his father; and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for the ages, and of his kingdom there shall not be an end".
Now I want to go to the Old Testament to work out this thought of greatness, and take up Abraham first.
Abraham represents the heavenly man. Others of course are included, but he in a special way is the leader of the heavenly race; so that he represents christianity. Isaac is also the heavenly man, the heavenly man engaged in the testimony here. That
{286}
is, Abraham was more Christ as purely heavenly. He sought a heavenly country; he sought a city whose Builder and Maker was God. "Such as the heavenly one, such also the heavenly ones", @1 Corinthians 15:48. That is how we come in in relation to heaven, and he represents this thought peculiarly, for it lies in God being with us. Any aspiration to greatness without that will come to nothing. Abraham represents greatness that accrues from God's being with us. Abimelech recognises this fact, and it is a very practical fact too which ought to come home to us at the very outset of what I am speaking of, whether men observe this in us, that God is with us. That is what, as you will observe, Abimelech says to Abraham, "God is with thee in all that thou doest". Now Abimelech would not flatter Abraham; he is a Philistine, and a Philistine is a characteristic rival of the heavenly man, so that when he says, "God is with thee in all that thou doest", it is because he is forced to say it. The evidence was apparent. I am not acquiring greatness by my own ingenuity or skill; I am not advancing myself or seeking to in the eyes of my neighbours. My thought is that it should be apparent that God is with me in all that I do. You may say, Well, that may apply to the meeting. There are those who confine the thought of God's being with us to the meeting, that particular side of the position, but that is not the thought at all; that is only part of it. Abimelech here says, "God is with thee in all that thou doest". That was the test and that is to be the test, whether God is with me, whether He can be with me in what I am doing. If I branch out in a business way and become distinguished in any sense, I cannot count upon God for that. I may succeed; many have. That is not the greatness that is in mind.
That greatness could never attach to Christ: "*He*  shall be great". Luke gives you the fact at the very beginning. "*He* shall be great"; that kind of a man
{287}
is to be great. The "He" is emphatic, as I said. So that any effort to become great of one's own ability or with a view to his greatness in this world must be without God; further, any greatness acquired without God is coming to nothing, and worse. So that Abimelech recognised this in the patriarch, "God is with thee", he says, "in all that thou doest". That is, the Philistine king said that to Abraham. So much concerned about it was he that he sought to make a covenant with Abraham, and Abraham did make a covenant with him. I am just touching on that one point, but the heavenly man advances because God is with him. Neither does he want any other advances. We are enjoined to continue in our callings, whatever they may be as we become converted, but to continue in them with God. That is the thought. "God is with thee in all that thou doest".
Then we come to this same Abraham in bereavement, and bereavement is sure to overtake each of us, and what comes out into view here is another section of the inhabitants of the land, the sons of Heth; the Philistine, the big man of this world religiously, had already spoken to him, had recognised the heavenly man as great; that is, he recognised that God was with him. Now the sons of Heth had a burying place to sell, and we see the bereaved heavenly man who calls Sarah, "my dead". You may be sure he felt bereavement more than any of the sons of Heth would feel it. It is the heavenly man alone that feels bereavement aright. Jesus supremely felt it; He wept. It is the reflection of the heavenly, feeling things aright in a seemly way. Abraham makes no show here, but he feels he lost Sarah. He calls her, "my dead"
"that I may bury my dead". But he is nevertheless great; he is great in that. To attain greatness in all circumstances is a great matter. God would have us to be great in all circumstances, and the heavenly man would be that; so that the sons of Heth say, "Thou
{288}
art a prince of God among us" (verse 6). He is among these people, the sons of Heth. But what a testimony to the heavenly; here is a man without any worldly associations at all; he has come out from his worldly associations, from his country, from his kindred, from his father's house, that he might become a mighty prince in the midst of the sons of Heth, and they have to own it, and that he is that in bereavement.
Then in chapter 26 we have Christ. Isaac is a type of Christ, and a type of the christian too, but he is a type of Christ. We say he is a type of Christ as the heavenly man, but that is not enough; Abraham is characteristically, distinctively the heavenly man; Isaac is the heavenly man, but he is the heavenly man officially, as if God would say, 'You must have the heavenly man before you can have the official, before you can have witnesses here in the testimony'. That is what comes out in Genesis. It is the heavenly side; christianity inaugurated by Paul; "Such as the heavenly one, such also the heavenly ones"; but then the sheet comes down from heaven, knit at the four corners. It is the heavenly crisis: Peter on the house top became in a trance, and saw this wonderful vision; it was Christ, the true Isaac, operating officially now to bring the heavenly into the vision of the minister down here. That is what is in mind, and there is going to be true greatness, great things in this man. So we have first of all that he sowed in that land (chapter 26: 12). The heavenly man is going to produce something from his own sowing. It is to be a heavenly crop, as it were; God is so particular about this. He fills these chapters with this heavenly thought, so that it is the Christ; it is the Christ that took out Paul, and sent down the sheet; it is Christ in His official capacity in heaven, and the assembly here in the tent of Sarah. It is not the assembly in heaven; we have the suggestion that the assembly is of heaven, but here in testimony; it is heavenly in
{289}
the sense that Christ is of heaven; the assembly is of heaven; the Son of man is of heaven; the Father is of heaven; that is the idea. They all come out; so that you have the sheet; it is operated from above; it is let down from above, let down and taken up again. The operations are from above, not from down here. So I link all that up with this passage. Isaac sowed in that land. He is particularly notified by Jehovah that he is operating in relation to Abraham. Abraham is the beginning of all this; so that God had said to him, "Unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries; and I will perform the oath which I swore unto Abraham thy father", @Genesis 26: 3. Isaac is the official heavenly man to effect heavenly thoughts down here. What a product that is of heaven, and to go back into heaven. So Isaac is enjoined to stay in this land, and he stayed and sowed in that land, as you will observe: "Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year a hundredfold". Now that is the top product or crop of both Mark and Matthew. It is a hundredfold. This is the best result that is contemplated in the gospel, a hundredfold. The Lord is the heavenly Man taking up the apostle Paul, as I apprehend; He got the best; it is the heavenly side of the truth, and He got a hundredfold; then in connection with it it says, "The man became great, and he became continually greater, until he was very great". He waxed great, and went forward until he became very great. Now you can understand, I hope, that what I am speaking of is linked on with Luke, but it is no question here of Christ viewed in abstract dealings; it is what works out in the saints; it is true greatness working out on these lines. We are in remnant times, but still it is very stimulating and balancing to get the primary thought of God and work on these lines; where are we going to see that without the heavenly official Man? You will understand that Christ has never lost that character; He remains the official;
{290}
He is charged with the holy service of God; for the present He will take up the earthly side: Isaac is the heavenly man, but the heavenly man engaged in service here for a result, so that he sows in that land. God has told him where to sow, and he received, literally, 'found'; the thought is that he sowed and that he secured. There may be much sowing and very little reaping but we want to get the result. He *received* a hundredfold. It says, "Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year a hundredfold; and Jehovah blessed him. And the man became great, and he became continually greater, until he was very great". That is Christ; that is the official Christ, if you understand me, the heavenly Christ occupied in service, since Pentecost, but particularly in Paul's ministry. So that Paul's epistles bring out the greatness of Christ, peculiarly so. John's gospel does, as I have been saying, but that is much later; the gospels are simply confirmatory of the epistles. Paul brings out the greatness of Christ in the service, "Christ in you", as he says. It is a known Christ: "Christ in you the hope of glory", @Colossians 1: 27. So that the epistle to the Colossians enlarges upon the greatness of Christ, but from the point of view, as I have been saying, that He shall be great.
But I want you to particularly pay attention to this, that he received that same year one hundredfold. Whatever that year may mean in the history of the church, maybe it is over, he received in that year one hundredfold. God blessed him, and he grew and grew until he was very great. How we admire the thought of his greatness from this point of view, from the wonderful sowing, wrought among the nations, from the apostle Paul, and what a yield! Luke tells us that the assemblies grew in number every day. Think of that. If they grew in number every day in this country, what a large number we would have. I am afraid it is rather dying out, and the Lord would have
{291}
us to take it to heart, as to what increase there is, if there is any, and why there is not more, one hundredfold in one year.
Well, now I go on to Joshua. Of course he gives us another view of Christ-"On that day Jehovah magnified Joshua". Magnified, of course, means 'made great'. God had promised him that he would do that. It is how the Lord Jesus becomes magnified in our eyes, as we become spiritual. We have been speaking of being heavenly, but Joshua speaks of Christ understood spiritually. In Exodus he comes into our view as a capable man. Of course, he is called a young man, so he must have been a young man then, but a very capable man. He was to choose out men of war; he was not to make himself great, but he was to make an army for Israel, and we are told that he discomfited Amalek with the edge of the sword; that means Christ coming into the young believer's soul in a spiritual way; he begins to see how the Lord helps him in an indefinable way, in his day-today exercises up and down, but nevertheless he always seems to gain something, day by day. The Lord never seems to leave him without any encouragement. In all of our experiences the Lord is graciously there to give us some little bit of encouragement-'I am with you in this' and He will be greatly magnified in your eyes. The thing is we do not know the Lord enough spiritually; we know Him objectively, but we do not know Him spiritually; that is, know Him inwardly, in our inward experiences. As soon as you begin to know the Lord that way, He says, You will know Me better, and it is so. He increases in your eyes, and you see how great He is, especially as you get your feet on the solid ground of resurrection. You find purpose, and that is what He is aiming at in our experiences, to get our feet on solid ground in relation to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ from the dead. Peter says, God "has raised him from among the dead and given
{292}
him glory, that your faith and hope should be in God", @1 Peter 1: 21. It is so that we might get our feet on the solid ground of what the Lord is as raised from among the dead.
So that as Joshua begins to operate in bringing the people into Canaan, Jehovah says, "This day will I begin to magnify thee", and in this verse he has done it. He magnifies Joshua, we are told, in the sight of all Israel. Abraham was magnified in the sight of the Philistines, and so was Isaac, but now it is in the sight of all Israel; it is a question of Christ as the Head spiritually; it is in the sight of all Israel. The people look on spiritually; Christ is to be magnified. I do urge this; it will be the solution of many difficulties, if Christ comes into your vision in this way, if you are able to take your stand in relation to all Israel, and see that Christ is operating to get your feet on the solid ground of resurrection, as Paul says, "If any way I arrive at the resurrection from among the dead", @Philippians 3: 11. He was aiming at that, that he might get his feet on the solid ground of divine purpose in the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. So that as Joshua operates on these lines, it says, "On that day Jehovah magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they had feared Moses, all the days of his life". He acquires a place in the soul; and it is a great steadying power when Christ acquires a place from this point of view; that is, the point of view of Joshua, so that we feel we are moving, maybe like a glacier, slowly on to the side of divine purpose, and the sure ground of the resurrection of Christ. That is the only solid ground there is, Christ in resurrection. There is the ascension too, but the power of Jordan, the waters of Jordan are driven miles away up stream, so that the people went over on dry ground. It is a question of the power of God, that the waters are cut off, and all Israel passes over. I commend this part, because I believe it is less understood
{293}
than any other part of scripture, because it is a wholly spiritual matter.
Then I go on to David, in 2 Samuel, and the sorrowful thing that comes to our notice in this respect is a long war, a very sorrowful thing. It is not a war with Philistines, or the inhabitants of the land, but with those who are nominally, and really, our brethren. There was a long war, it says, between the house of Saul and the house of David, a long war! This applies in crises amongst us; crises arise and the effects of the conflict go on, long after, and that is so with David and Saul. There was a long war. It was very humbling that it should be long, this war between brethren. It has its own meaning here: there were elements, such as Joab, that were the secret of it; they were not any better than the servants of Saul. The war was long, but then it says, "David became continually stronger, and the house of Saul became continually weaker". Just look at that. That is a sure evidence of where God is and where God is not; where the waxing stronger is and where the weakness is. It is not spasmodic, but it is a steady thing, a waxing stronger and stronger. That is just as it was with Abraham. David waxed stronger and stronger. It does not say the house of David here. It is "David", but "the house of Saul", for Saul is dead. Alas! his house went on, his house carried on on the same principles, inveterate opposition to the anointed of God. So it says that the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker. And now, to finish the thought in chapter 5, we have Christ. The history really begins with Abraham; now we have Christ in type as the king, not the heavenly man as in Abraham, but He is an official, as Isaac was, so to speak, and then kingship is seen in ascension, in going up. So in chapter 1 of this book, David is said to be two days in Ziklag; that is where he recovered all, and he spoke beautifully about Saul; there was no rankling of hatred against
{294}
an inveterate hater; no! He spoke most nobly and beautifully about Saul and Jonathan. He spoke of Jonathan's love for him, a beautiful tribute to Jonathan, but really a tribute to the magnanimous spirit of David; that is whether it be Christ (of course, it is perfect there) or whether it be a christian who is thoroughly victorious over himself; he is thoroughly adjusted and has a magnanimous, not a vindictive, spirit. He has the spirit of Jesus. So he says to Jehovah, "Shall I go up ..? And Jehovah said to him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? and he said, Unto Hebron", @2 Samuel 2: 1. It is on the line of ascension, and on this line of ascension we have this sorrowful comment-the long war; but still David is on the line of ascension, and he is growing stronger and stronger. I read this, dear brethren, because it is the true way of victory, waxing stronger and stronger on the line of ascension. If a murderer comes and slays my enemy, I might vaunt over it, but not so David; he wept. He rent his garments when he heard that Saul was slain, as he was, by a Philistine sword: "The shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as not anointed with oil",
@2 Samuel 1:21. He was anointed of God; he could not but feel it, and God valued that. And when Abner was slain, he says, "Should Abner die as a fool dieth?" (chapter 3: 33). David felt it, but he followed the bier and we are told that everything he did pleased the people; why should it not? It was the spirit of Christ. Everything he did was right in the eyes of Israel. The true Israel will come to that; that everything that Christ does in the eyes of the people of God is right. It is true greatness, too. Ishbosheth, his great enemy, king Saul's son, is slain, but there is still the same spirit in David, the spirit of Jesus Christ. So that he waxed greater and greater. You can understand it, and now he has got to the top point; he has been in Hebron seven years and six months, and he is
{295}
anointed king over Israel and he comes to Jerusalem. That is the ascent of the king; the ascent, as it says of Solomon, the ascent by which he went up. It is the beautiful gate. It is easy to go up, but it is the ascent by which we go up. Elisha represented the idea of going up; he saw Elijah going up. Elijah says, 'If you see me go up you will get your request'. We must have our eye on the ascension; the ascension is the great point now. The children come out and they say to Elisha, "Go up, bald head!". That was opposition from a wicked generation, as it is called, the Jewish generation, a wicked and adulterous generation. It is reprobate and the she-bears come out of the wood and tore forty-two of them; that is that kind of opposition, opposition to the going up line.
"Go up, bald head!". What a reproach! Think of that! Think of speaking of the man of God like that, and yet young people do speak very glibly, very foolishly and very rashly, too: "Go up, bald head!". God would deepen His work in our souls to solemnise us in what we say; these young people were opposing the truth for the moment. "Go up, bald head!", they say, and two she-bears come out of the wood and tore forty-two of them.
Now David is going up and he comes to the zenith, that is Jerusalem; and they say, He cannot enter Zion. That is again a reproach, as if he could not do it. Who understood it? No one. He is going to take Zion; so it says, "David took the stronghold of Zion, which is the city of David". They had said, "Thou shalt not come in hither, but the blind and lame will drive thee back". Nevertheless, David took the stronghold of Zion, and then we are told in verse 10, "David became continually greater; and Jehovah the God of hosts was with him". What we are told of him, what he built inwardly, is in verse 9. So that now it is the greatness of Christ in this sense in building inwardly; that is what the Lord is doing
{296}
now. He is helping us build up our intelligences and affections in regard of God, in regard to the worship of God, the service of God, the inside place. That is what David was doing; that is what Christ is doing. We cannot say much of the lame and the blind, but they are hated of David's soul. Lameness and blindness are spiritual matters. People say, 'I cannot see it'. It is to be seen, but if you do not see it you are blind, and David hates that. They rest behind it, as if their blindness were a virtue. If you do not see it you ought to see it, and if you do not see it you are blind. David hates that. And David does not like the lame, those that hobble along, inconsistent people; that is what he does not like. Nevertheless, David took the stronghold of Zion. It is a question of the hearts of the saints, and he builds inwardly so that we might worship God, and that is the main thought in David, to build a house and establish the service of God. He is called the sweet psalmist of Israel; he must be the leader. He is the sweet psalmist of Israel; that is, the Lord leads the service of God in the midst of us. I have seen all round the world the evidence of the work of God in that inward way, leading the saints to worship God in spirit and in truth.
{297}
CHRIST, THE OBJECT OF UNDIVIDED ATTENTION
@Luke 5: 11
Beginning with Abel and right down through the types, one person is outstanding in each epoch and such affords an object for faith, as typical of Christ. So faith is tested in an object, one object for undivided attention; that is what is in the mind of God; He would draw that out in us. One could cite many instances, even in hostile instances, when it was said of Christ, that the eyes of all were fixed on Him. And what has been said suggests all this. Moses became an object, even for the many persons who did not go with him, but specially for those who sought the Lord. Others stood in the doors of their tents, and looked after him, but that leaves us in our tents, where we may be surrounded with idolatrous or other influences. They stood in their tent doors and looked after him, for one who is representing God here below is capable of affecting even such people; and yet it adds nothing to them at all, save that it makes them more responsible.
Now this verse has, you might say, in the Lord's ministry, reference to what we call business. We are resident, most of us, in this great business metropolis. It is the recognised business metropolis of the country, perhaps, in a way, of the world, and this item of the Lord's ministry fits in peculiarly with this community. It is a place where there is the idea of holdings or belongings, blocks of property and stocks, bonds; persons engaged in these things are numerous comparatively, although their holdings may dwindle or become enlarged overnight. It is a centre of that kind, an immense centre, and we are in it and sure to be affected by it. Only as in the Spirit do we emerge
{298}
from and survive such influences; especially as business advantages and results add to us, and it seems to be quite legitimate to our mind to enjoy such things, but what is legitimate is often most harmful, because it eases the conscience. The conscience is not brought into it.
And so this section begins with the idea of the business of a certain man, the fishing business. It is one of the fishing scenes of the Scriptures, and the Lord is seen entering into it in the beginning of the chapter. It says, "And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret, and saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets. And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's". Now this is a remarkable scene, for the Lord is engaged in His own fine that He came here for. He is "The Word" Himself, and is engaged with the word of God, we are told. He was never deflected in the least from His own proper service by any incident. The Lord was always engaged with what should engage Him, the word of God here. Many were present to hear; it was evidently an interesting time, and the Lord takes advantage of two empty boats, boats that had been used well, used profitably. Their owners, or the fishermen, were gone out of them, it says, and were washing their nets; that is, they were clean business-men, as we might say, for as in a business centre like this unless this cleanness affects us, we shall not be available for what the Lord is engaged in. We may turn aside in the evening several times a week, or perhaps not more than once a week -- business would hold us otherwise perhaps. But here, although Simon was evidently one of those washing the nets, well employed, he was not far away. The boat was under his eye, and as the Lord entered to use it, he was ready to take part in what the Lord was
{299}
doing. He was drawn, in spirit, from the height of business activity, to be with the Lord in what He was doing. There is a readiness to turn aside to what the Lord is engaged in. He is not affected by the buzz of business in a boat, not in the least. He is supreme; He walks on the waters; He is going on with His own line of things. How suggestive all that is to me, dear brethren! We are occupied with the Lord's things on the Lord's day, but He is occupied with them on Monday, and all the other days of the week. It is His own line, and He is never deflected from it. Peter, although his boat is empty, is there; he is not far away, and the Lord is going on with His fine of things, not Peter's business, and He is quite ready. It says, "He entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him", for he was near by, "that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship". That ship would scarcely be mortgaged. You can understand that it would be free; the Lord would regard it in that light. It was Peter's. And he was available to the Lord, and the Lord sits down there undisturbed.
Now I speak of all that, dear brethren, so that it might come to us in our setting here, because whatever the business may be, it is to be washed; it is sure to affect the brethren unless it is washed; so that the proof of superiority to it is that I am ready to join with the Lord in what He is doing. It is not what you are doing, you are washing your nets, and doing well, but it is what the Lord is doing. He is setting forth the word of God, and that is what I am to do. I am to leave my end of all my matters; whatever I have, and allow the Lord liberty there, and He will have liberty there, and what an honour it is that He should wish, dear brethren, that there is nothing to repel Him in my business circumstances. Peter is ready.
{300}
Now I just mention all these things briefly to suggest all this, and the result of the Lord's coming into one's circumstances in this way, really, as I might say, on the Monday, in the height of business pressure. I turn aside and lend myself to the Lord, and He accepts it in effect; He seeks it, and is it not so, that He is ready? He will always seek it from the most occupied person; the Lord will say, 'I would like your attention; I am going on with something; I am not ignoring what you are doing, but I am going on with something, the greatest possible thing; that is, the word of God'. The word of God is brought in where man's mind is so full, and though one's mind is so occupied and full, one is really delivered in the midst of that, from the height and the pressure of business; one is free to be with the Lord.
Now that is the setting, and you all know the story of how Peter is reached here. Luke gives us a peculiar history of Peter, not like that given by Matthew and Mark. This is how he is reached, not to enlarge upon it but only to show that in this setting there were partners. Partners are testing to each other, and if we have partners in business, that experience ought only to qualify us to be partners in spiritual things, and that suggests that spiritual things are a partnership. There are two words used; the first word is that the partner is available; he could beckon to him; that is, I can call on the brethren; normally, I can call on the brethren; I can beckon. He beckons to his partner. The Lord had given him great prosperity. Peter did not lose anything in these matters, nor shall we ever lose anything in turning aside and saying, 'Lord, Your matters are greater than mine; You are dealing with eternal matters; I am dealing with temporal'. The Lord will see that you do not suffer, nor did Peter suffer. He had a great catch, and the partners were near. Would to God that we might just get this little thought of the partners! There are
{301}
two words, as I said, the one is that they were each moving along, each having his own part, but that they were at the beck and call of the brethren; they were ready; they came, and this matter was suggested. The Lord did not help them to fill the ships; it is for you to do that. You say, The Lord will do it, but it is for you to do, and in matters that are needing adjustment amongst us, it is for us to settle amongst us. The Lord did not do anything in regard to the sinking of the ships. They did; they were partners. And then in verse 10, they shared together in astonishment, and that is what I call the real responsibility of partnership; that we shall share together in some work of God. They were astonished, we are told. It is a different word used for partners, because it means sharing good things. It is not like simply getting things, and having friends to help adjust matters, but to share the good things of God, as common partners, as in @Acts 2. It says in verses 9, 10, "He was astonished, and all that were with him ... And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon". You see they were partners. It is another word there, not simply what we had here tonight; not simply that we beckon to one another, but that we are sharing, sharing here in the things of God. It is for all; we share alike. "He was astonished, and all that were with him ... also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon". That is the state that is brought in, the happy result of the work of God; the great miracle of the fishes, equally enjoyed. And what does this astonishment lead to? A greater appreciation of Christ, that He is the undivided Object of their attention. That is the idea; that we become one in contemplation of the Lord. And so it says, "Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men". That is, it is not a question of grabbing after what this great city affords; it does
{302}
afford immense opportunities for ability, if one knows how to use it; nowhere on earth are there more opportunities for material things than in this city, but the Lord says, 'That is all over; it is what I am going on with'. He brings out the value of men, real men.
Luke brings that out: "Good will toward men", not wealth, material belongings, but men. "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men", @Luke 2:14. This is what the Lord seeks, and the word of the Lord affects men; it brings the word of God into men and changes them completely about, and makes them more like a race after all.
Dear brethren, this is a wonderful thing to my mind. The Lord says, 'You will be catching men'; not, 'You will seek to do it', but 'You will be doing it; you will succeed'. What an opportunity to turn aside, wholeheartedly, to see the great line of things that the Lord is engaged in, and have an active part in it; then it says, "When they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him". That is what I am thinking of, one of the finest things you can get, at the very height of their prosperity, they forsook all. So fully was the Lord in their hearts and minds, that they forsook all, the one Object fills the minds as Colossians puts it, "Christ is everything, and in all". So they forsook all, and they followed Him.
{303}
ODOUR
@2 Corinthians 2: 14 - 16; @Revelation 5: 8; @Revelation 8: 3
It seems appropriate that we might have a word, dear brethren, at the end of our meeting, perhaps referring to what we have had, and bearing on what is sorrowfully before us after this meeting, namely, the idea of odour, which appears in these scriptures. The thought of it appears early in the Scriptures, for it would seem that the bdellium mentioned as early as @Genesis 2 alludes to a certain fragrant article or product such as a resin coming out in relation to gold and precious stones. We were speaking of gold and precious stones in referring to the refinement of adornment and bdellium would suggest odour which is in keeping with such refinement. So that in the tabernacle, we have these things: gold, as we have said, alluding to what is wrought out by God in us, and we have also the precious stones, particularly in the breastplate worn by the high priest and enclosing, by skill divinely given, the names of the saints. How precious they are in the divine sight! And then the whole scene of the tabernacle, fragrant with odour, divinely compounded, particularly as the priest dressed the lamps, that is, as discipline came in, or correction or removal of defilement, accumulated snuff; the scent was to be fragrant with the incense as the process went on.
And it occurred to me, dear brethren, that it is a matter to have before us, and in view of that, what a city this is, of obnoxious odours beyond description morally. We have to encounter these; they call forth what is in ourselves of a like kind, and work out, too, in feelings that are merely of the flesh, unwholesomely odorous. So that as answering in a little way to the tabernacle, there is the necessity for these typical things. What they mean is urgent; that is, that these
{304}
obnoxious odours should be overpowered with thoughts of Christ brought in; as the fire from the altar of God is applied the incense comes up and fills the scene; the high priest enters the holiest in a cloud, even the high priest, so that in having to say to the things of God, having to say to God in His ministry, in the sanctuary, these odours, these fragrant precious traits of Christ worked out in us, alongside the gold, are essential, or the divine nostrils are offended, so to speak. There is what God sees, what He hears, and what He smells, and these fragrant spices, so much touched on in Exodus, carried on from Genesis, are seen as essential to the service of God in His sanctuary; indeed, this is not a thought to be put away from us, for we are said to be God's house: "Whose house are we", a great fact, answering to the tabernacle; the true tabernacle, indeed, which the Lord has pitched, so that all the scent is to be fragrant.
I selected these three scriptures to show how it worked out in a typical way. The first one alludes to service manward. The apostle is saying, "But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and makes manifest the odour of his knowledge through us in every place", a savour of His knowledge! What the knowledge of God is as over against what is current, for example, knowledge that is taught in the universities and schools! Most of it is a knowledge falsely so-called, as Scripture says; much of it, in fact all of it, is tinged with falsity, and what an odour that is, I might say, to the spiritual nostrils! Whereas the apostle as coming into a town would bring fragrance of divine knowledge through the gospel. That is one thing, the service manward, and then, "For we are a sweet odour of Christ to God, in the saved and in those that perish; to the one an odour from death unto death, but to the others an odour from life unto life". That was what marked him in all his service, the fragrance that was there for any that had nostrils
{305}
for it, and also for God. So that whether there were results or otherwise, the fragrance was there.
And then, applying to a weekly meeting that is now observed, namely, the meeting for prayer: we have in @Revelation 5 that the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders "fell before the Lamb, having each a harp and golden bowls full of incenses, which are the prayers of the saints". It is a verse that covers peculiarly our meeting for prayer. It is not the prayers being prayed here, but kept in vials, golden bowls, from every possible taint or corruption like the box of spikenard. Spiritual prayers last; they do not evaporate, nor do they become affected by exposure, as one might say. Here they are kept in golden bowls, a most remarkable thing, as if these servants of God, the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures, are so intelligent in the mind of God as to this great service of prayer, that the Spirit of God would convey to us that these prayers last; they are before God. Is it too much to say that the prayers of Abraham have not ceased to exist? I think not. I think they last; they are before God. All that speaks of Christ in all His fragrance to God in this way, right from the outset down, are preserved; everything is preserved. Things do not evaporate spiritually, as physical things do, but here they are kept, and so we are reminded of the need of the absence of mixed motives or words in our expressions to God, that they are such as can, as it were, be preserved. They last. If they are not answered today, they may be answered one hundred years hence. Think of @John 17 being answered now. It lasts. The Lord prayed for us, not only for those that heard Him and believed on Him at that time but for all that believed on Him through them. The prayers are essential, kept in gold vials, full of odours, which are the prayers of the saints. What treasure-keepers these twenty-four elders and the four living creatures are! The twenty-four elders are the men of
{306}
intelligence. They would remember Abraham's prayer. It is a marvellous thought, dear brethren, what prayers really are ! You see with a man like Zacharias in Luke, that he had prayed a long time before, may be, but now the angel comes and tells him his prayer is to be answered, and he did not believe him, but there his prayers were, kept before God, and they are all kept, and not one of them is lost in the dispensation of God. He takes account of the prayers of the men of God, the priests of God; they are all preserved. The more you think of it, the more you see the force of it, the value of it; hence the temple that David had the pattern of by the Spirit, had not only a treasury, but treasuries, and certain Levites, one of them a descendant of Moses particularly, looking after dedicated things, which went back to Saul the son of Kish, and even included some of Abner and Joab. We are not told how many treasuries of God there are; these men kept these treasuries, these prayers, full of odours, the prayers of the saints. So that there is hope for us, beloved brethren, in spite of the stirring up of feelings, through the odours that proceed in the prayers to God, whether in assembly or individually.
And then finally, the Lord Jesus Himself is seen as an Angel in chapter 8, "And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and much incense was given to him, that he might give efficacy to the prayers of all saints at the golden altar which was before the throne. And the smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of the saints, out of the hand of the angel before God". So that you see how Christ comes in, as He does, and we experience it in our meetings for prayer, how He comes in and adds to what there is. The prayers are the incense, and it is fragrant, and heaven is enriched by the prayers of saints, all made possible through our High Priest, that is, our Lord Jesus Christ before the throne. So that
{307}
the prayers go in to the throne. We see how things work into each other in the final way, so that the throne is moved by the prayers of the saints, all made infinitely efficacious by the incense, and by the golden censer in the hand of Christ.
{308}
DIVINE LEADERSHIP
@Psalm 107: 7 - 38; @Isaiah 63: 11 - 14; @Hebrews 2: 10 - 12
These scriptures speak about divine leadership, and I wish to enlarge on them from that point of view. That God would Himself become the Leader of His people is touching and reminds us of the *many* services that He renders to us; that God Himself should become our Servant, I speak reverently, is one of the most touching considerations; amongst these services, one of the most important is leadership. The first scripture, that is, @Psalm 107, contemplates divine leadership in these last days; the second one speaks of it in the early days; and the third one speaks of it in its continuous sense. I want to speak of these features with a view to working out their results, for God always has results in mind, as for instance, "And he led them forth by the right way", with the result "that they might go to a city of habitation"; that they might go. This psalm is the first psalm in the last book, the book that contemplates the fact that Israel had been scattered and now is being, or is about to be, gathered.
These books of the Psalms are intended to afford a rich material for the service of God, as our hymn book, indeed, in an inferior sense (for the Psalms are inspired) is intended to aid us in the service of God. You will see that the psalm is divided up into sections by "Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness". It is a call upon men, and between each of these calls or demands, we have reasons furnished why men should do this. The psalm thus opens rightly this great section of the book of Psalms, the fifth book, which culminates, as most of you know, in the great hallel of the whole book, when all that has breath is called upon to praise. The book thus contemplates a
{309}
great victory in that the people of God who had been scattered (grievously so, their own wills governing them in the scattering) are now restored, gathered out of the countries, as we are told in this first psalm. And at the end, they are regarded as a people near unto Jehovah, *near* unto Him. In this book we have what are called the Songs of degrees; that is to say, God graciously contemplating that His people under those circumstances, begin on a low level. Most of us will admit this. Normally, the spiritual believer advances from level to level; he goes from strength to strength, and every one of them appears before God. This book furnishes the levels one after another until we reach the divine altitude of Zion, where, as it says, "There hath Jehovah commanded the blessing, life for evermore". The book therefore is full of victory, and the saints are seen praising in the victory, and reaching the great divine end, namely, God, and the people near unto Him.
If there is one here not near unto God, this meeting is for you; for God is looking out for you, is demanding you to come near. His thought is a people near unto Him; and so it begins, as I said, by leading in a right way. How important that word 'right' is in our day! It is always important. There never was a time in the history of this world when the idea of right did not exist in it. But how loudly it speaks as we look back at the history of christendom, a history affording the saddest evidence of man's will, man's way, so that today we have a thousand ways, as we may say, amongst those that profess christianity, and amongst the people of God in those ways. They are byways, to say the least. One could enumerate many of them. The psalm contemplates how man in his will has got himself into these byways where he is utterly helpless, and as God works in a man's soul in these byways, darkened as they are, he begins to think of God, and God hears the cry unto Him. If you run
{310}
down the psalm at your leisure, you will see what I speak of, what plights men get into, what dark byways; dark associations exist as the outcome of the exercise of man's will. But God is helping; as the Spirit brooded over the waters of old, God is waiting, so that He might hear a cry, however faint. However faint, He knows; He discerns the movements of the heart, "Then they cried unto Jehovah", it says. He never fails. "And he delivered them out of their distresses". Whatever they may be, whatever one's will has led one into, a cry will bring in a divine intervention, a divine deliverance, not only out of the immediate acute trouble that may be oppressing me, but out of all my troubles. Such is God, beloved friends. The psalm is on a lower level, speaking relatively, for it is dealing, as I said, with the troubles of men, how they get into them, and how God is attentive, ready to serve, as a cry is emitted from any trouble here, so He delivers out of all troubles, whatever they be. There is not a trouble attendant on one that God will not descend to and consider and remove for those who have faith. He is waiting for the cry.
Well now, this right way is what I am speaking of amid all this darkness and confusion, amid these byways that lead nowhere or worse, for some of them lead to the pit. They do. It is depicted in the book of Proverbs. "A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing. For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city, to call passengers who go right on their ways: ... Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant. But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell", @Proverbs 9: 13 - 18. Terrible indeed are those ways, beloved friends, especially the young ones here, those ways that you scarce discern at first, but they lead into the depths of hell. And so in varied degrees
{311}
christendom is marked by these ways, and Jehovah begins by announcing that He led them forth in a right way. Who are those who are there? Well, if you will allow me, ourselves, beloved. It is those who are delivered from the authority of darkness and translated into the kingdom of the Son of God's love. As soon as we reach that point of any little deliverance, what is normal is a celebration: "Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!". We celebrate, and what do we celebrate? What is more seemly than to celebrate the right way? The psalm, as I say, is a call for special celebrations, but how seemly it is that we should fall in with this, we whose feet have been in the ways of unrighteousness but who are now extricated from the snare of the fowler, for the snare is broken and we are escaped! "Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!", and amongst these, the occasion of this celebration is, "He led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation", that is to say, that we might be diverted from formalism and all its hierarchical offices and associations, that have been played up for centuries in christendom, and from all other paths, social, commercial, political, or whatever else, by a divine, gracious, patient, tender leading into the right way, so that we might go. How delightful it is to God to see a young christian, a young brother or sister as discerning the leadership of God, move of himself, taking the initiative himself! God is waiting for that; although He loves to lead you, too; He loves to see you go according to the principles that He has led you in. He loves to see you go to the end of the matter. There is an end to the leading: that they might go to a city of habitation, which means the very opposite of these hierarchical offices and associations. They do not present the idea of a city of habitation.
{312}
A city of habitation in the life of the Spirit of God means an ordered state of things where life is, where property and life are cared for and where they are cherished, a city of habitation. You know in these special meetings that one is accustomed to attend, and I attend a good many, young people are very prominent, and thank God for it! These meetings are intended for them, but the challenge is, What do you come for? What is in your mind? God is a God of purpose, and if He works in a man's or woman's soul, He means that person to be a person of purpose in some sense. Have I come to a city of habitation? It is in truth the gathering of the people of God where ordered light and life are. Have I got something different in mind? Do I come for some other purpose? If you come for some other purpose, God is against you in every step you take. He is watching these occasions as much as or more than your parents are. The authority of parents does not cease when children attend such meetings. God is against all else but the city of habitation, where you come in contact with men and women who live in the Spirit, whose calling is heavenly, whose associations occasion a heavenly atmosphere. The meetings will not be neglected. What have you come for, save for the meeting, save to find the living and not the dead? God is appealing to the young, and these meetings are for them, but they are not to serve an occasion for the flesh but to promote what is of God in the youngest, that he might value the things of God, that he might see their superiority to anything that the world offers. You will find it constantly in the Old Testament that the young people ask their elders about the things of God; they are supposed to. It is in asking that you get instruction. The Lord Jesus at the age of twelve was found among the doctors. That is typical, as I might say of the brethren who can teach you and can impart divine things to you. He is found among the
{313}
doctors. Did He go up with His parents to see the sights of Jerusalem? No, beloved friends. The males went up three times a year to Jerusalem. It was in a spiritual sense, and the Lord gives a lead to every young person here in that He was found among the doctors. What was He doing there? Hearing and asking questions. What was His business? -- His Father's. It is the first time that He is on His Father's business. It is a very fine moment when a young man or young woman puts God before his parents. The influence of the parents should lead to that very thing, not as in the case of Mary and Joseph. They questioned it, but the Lord Jesus sets an example for the young. He is found among the doctors in the temple, hearing and asking questions, and He says that He was about His Father's business. He has passed Joseph and Mary in that sense. It is a fine moment when a young man or young woman puts God, in that way, first. What a dignity there is!
But I am speaking now about this right way, and how it leads so that you might come to a city of habitation, and as having again come into it we have in the closing words of the psalm how God tarries in grace where He arrests men in their plights. We are told in the second part of the psalm, "He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings. And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation". Now that is a call for the establishment of meetings cities of habitation, as they are called here. "That they may prepare a city for habitation". How can they do it? They do it because of the prosperity that God affords them. Let us not be afraid of the smallness of the number! The Lord is able to make it stand. See what He made of Adam and Eve! See what He made of Abraham! He called them alone, and He blessed them. It is what God can do; it is not a question of forming something for ourselves. It
{314}
is a question of the city of habitation, and how is it furnished? By all the prosperity that we may expect from God if we are men of faith. If we are not men of faith, let us not attempt it. This is a dispensation of faith, and anything short of faith will come to naught and disaster, but if there is faith, God can make the thing stand, not only so, but prosper it. So that you have here, "He turneth the wilderness into a standing water". There are two or three brothers: Adam was one; Abraham was one, and Noah was one. See what God made out of them! It is a question of faith in these last days, and this psalm is to encourage us to be diverted into the divine way, by divine leadership to a city of habitation. God would establish this principle over against man's will in what marks christendom. The city of habitation is a great divine thought. It is said to be in the midst of prosperity spiritually, as it says in these verses. It says, "And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation; and sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase. He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease". These are wonderful verses in our day when God is seeking those cities of habitation where there is life and order and with all that, where men may dwell in holy love, in holy friendship. Let us learn what friendship means! Without it, beloved friends, our fellowship is but a name. Friendship is the great thought: "Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends", @John 15: 15.
The Lord would bring us into confidence with one another so that friendship can be promoted where there is this holy state of things, this living state of things, a city of habitation.
Now I wanted to go on to @Isaiah 63 to show you how the Spirit of God in these last days would remind
{315}
us of the first days, for God never gives up the first days. "I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown. Israel was holiness unto the Lord, and the firstfruits of his increase", @Jeremiah 2: 2, 3. How delightful that is for God to look back to. Sometimes I think of Palestine, and Arabia, and Asia Minor, and Macedonia, and all the territory around Illyricum and Italy and Spain and North Africa. What must it be to Christ to look down on those territories! Hardly a sign of life in all that immense territory which once furnished by the power of the Spirit of God that which was of God in His people. What must it be to the Lord to think of that! Do you think He forgets, looking down on Derbe and Lystra and all those points where Paul ministered or was productive? What must it be to His eye! God is in sympathy with all that, but He has come further west, and His eye travels to this vast continent, and He sees the little specks of life here and there amid the sterility that marks it. And He wishes to increase those little specks of life, and order, and light, and friendship, and so He reverts in those verses in @Isaiah 63 to what marked the earlier leadings of God, and I wish you to note, dear brethren, the recurrence of the reference to the Holy Spirit in these verses. You will notice that it says in verse 10, "But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit". We are reminded of the Lord's own remark. "And whosoever shall have spoken a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him", @Matthew 12: 32. They rebelled against His holy Spirit. It is not simply God in the abstract, but His holy Spirit. God came down so low, so graciously, so as to serve us in any way in which we need service, God Himself, but it is in the Spirit, and these verses revert to that fact, to the service of the Spirit and the
{316}
rebellion against the Spirit. Let us be on our guard, dear young people, against grieving the Holy Spirit of promise, against quenching Him, in this way. You perhaps may criticise the ministry, those who serve you, those who feed you, and so the Spirit of God reverts to earlier days, and it says in verse ii, "But he remembered the days of old, Moses and his people Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock?". That is how He began it. It alludes to the wonderful furnishing of God's thought. Israel was brought into a wilderness. He brought them out, and He brought them out with shepherds. There were Aaron and Moses and Miriam, we are told, and others; God provided them. Let us understand that if we are wanting in shepherds today, it is not the divine thought. At the outset, He brought them out through the sea with shepherds. In every divine movement, God would furnish shepherds. The demand for shepherds is great. The need is great, of leadership according to God. He led them forth by the right way in their last days, and so in their earlier days He led them through the Red Sea, but He led the shepherds with them. Moses and Aaron and Miriam knew what to do. God had prepared them for years and years to be shepherds of His people, and He brought them all out with shepherds that they might be furnished in the wilderness, and then moreover He says, "Where is he that put his holy Spirit within him?" (verse 11), that is, in Moses, reminding us that leadership (if anyone aspires to it, and it is a good desire to lead the people of God) is by the Spirit, and if the Spirit has His part, it will be a lowly leading. The Spirit would promote this, "That one man should die for the people", @John 11: 50. That is leadership. Leadership is through death, and so the shepherds of God's flock, all of them, had to experience the bitterest persecution, the bitterest of opposition. The than Moses, we are told, had even
{317}
his own brother and sister bitterly opposed to him, but he was the meekest man on all the earth. There was no reproach in his mouth. As the Lord says, "Yea, I am as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs" (@Psalm 38: 14), but He led, and that is the leading. It is by the Holy Spirit. He "put his holy Spirit within him". There is no leading otherwise, and then it goes on to say, "His glorious arm leading them by the right hand of Moses", the very best that Moses could afford, the right hand of a man. "Cursed be he that doeth the work of Jehovah negligently" (@Jeremiah 48: 10), and Moses never did.. His whole being was in the work of God; he led them by his right hand. That is the very best a man can afford. And then it says, "Dividing the waters before them, to make himself an everlasting name" (verse 12). What a glorious thing that is amongst the people of God, God making Himself an everlasting name by the leaders He employs! Is He doing anything with them that makes Himself an everlasting name? What a great privilege and honour it is that God can use any of us, and how necessary it is to put the right hand into all that you are doing, all the strength you have in this glorious service, that God might make Himself an everlasting name by you! And then it says further as regards that leading, "Who led them through the depths, like a horse in the wilderness, and they stumbled not" (verse 13). In fact, they do not stumble, that is to say, the leading is of that kind. It is like leading a horse; in leading him he does not stumble. Anything that happens among us calls for understanding. Do I understand that the brethren do not stumble? What influence have I exerted in the wilderness? The horse did not stumble because of the leading. So that anything that occurs reflects back on every one of us. It is a state of affairs in the wilderness at the time, as a horse in the wilderness, that they should not stumble; and then
{318}
moreover it says, "As cattle go down into the valley, the Spirit of Jehovah gave them rest". What a beautiful thought that is! It is the Spirit of Jehovah; not an angel here, although that had been spoken of in the wilderness, but the Spirit of Jehovah carrying that on, all that God is in Christ; the Spirit of God carries that on, and what a thing it is to have Him!
It is God, beloved friends, in a thoughtful, tender, gracious way attending to everything. That is God, and He makes us to rest. We do not know much about this, because I admit we are constantly on the move, not only physically but spiritually, but you should know the place the sabbath had in Israel, so that about twenty-eight per cent of their time was employed in the sabbath. There is great instruction in that, and God would teach us how to be restful, not lazy or indolent, but spiritually restful in Him, so that the leading in the wilderness afforded the people a rest, like a flock going down into a rich field. It is so beautiful and suggestive to see how cows or cattle he down in the field. Well, that is God's way of leading.
Well, now to finish, the thought in @Hebrews 2 is well-known, the result of divine leadership in Christ. It says, "The leader of their salvation"; a leader is one that goes before, and here He is made perfect through sufferings. If any one aspires to leadership, this is to be in view, that perfection in it is through suffering. Beloved friends, if you are really leading according to what is of God, the suffering is not wanting. God will allow this one and that one to say this and that. The sufferings come up out of the ground; they are constant, but all the time you are being perfected. The great thought in Hebrews is to be made perfect, and any one aspiring to leadership has to have this in mind, that God made the Leader of our salvation perfect through sufferings. Where is He leading us?-to glory. As what?-as sons. Think of the dignity in that, being led as sons to glory. The
{319}
great end, the great destiny in all of this that I am speaking of, is glory. It is to inspire our hearts, to stimulate them; it involves suffering, to be sure, but glory. The leading is to glory. We are in the light of sonship going to glory. In speaking of it in an abstract way, going to glory, being led to glory, that word is well worth considering, even in regard to Christ Himself being received up in glory, not simply to heaven, but in glory. We are going to glory. But the Son is leading us and leading us to it through suffering, including the cross, of course, in the case of our Lord, but wherever the spirit of leadership is of this kind, it is through suffering, so that the leadership is being perfectly effectual. And the consequence, the result is stated in the next verse. "For both he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one". That is where it comes out. Think of Him going to glory and us following, and He turns around and says, 'These are My brethren'. In the presence of Michael and Gabriel and all the angels of heaven, 'These are My brethren'. What brethren?-led to glory through suffering. What a glory there is in this! What an appeal at this present moment, to suffer in the light of divine leadership, and then to call them brethren, mark you; not to think of them merely as brethren, but to call them brethren. "See what love the Father has given to us, that we should be called the children of God", @1 John 3: 1. It is not simply, "be", but, "be called" children of God and the brethren of Christ. Is it not attractive to all you young people to come into the ranks of the spiritual, those who have faith, who talk of this dignity of being led to glory by the Lord, and then to be known as His brethren so that He goes on to say, "I will declare thy name to my brethren"? @Psalm 22, that great suffering psalm, is cited here. Let us bathe our souls in it. It gives us lustre. So the Lord says, "My brethren". 'I will declare Thy name unto them'. As we had it this
{320}
afternoon, He says, "I ... will make it known", @John 17:26. That word "make it known" is not 'manifest'. Earlier in @John 17, He says, "I have manifested thy name", but in the last verse He says, "make it known", as if to bring the name of the Father into our souls; that we come to the greatest kind of love, the love wherewith the Father loves the Son, and then He says, "In the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises". You see what result there is in divine leading, that God is praised.
I would say again to every one of you young ones, God intends you to be a vessel of praise. First we are vessels of mercy, fitted for glory, and then vessels of praise so that the Lord can praise through you. He can do it through you. Think of being a vessel in His hand, a musical instrument, as it were, which He can use in His praise. May God bless these thoughts!
{321}
WALKING
@Zechariah 6: 7; @John 1: 35 - 39; @Romans 6: 4; @Romans 8: 4
I have in view to speak about walking, a subject that runs through the Scriptures; God is the first to walk, in the book of Genesis, and in the last book of the Bible we have Jesus walking amid the seven golden candlesticks. We also find Satan walking, a solemn matter. Peter says, "Your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walks about seeking whom he may devour", @1 Peter 5: 8. But the book of Job records something in a way more serious; that is, when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, "Satan came also", @Job 1: 6. This, no doubt, would apply to the so-called convocations of Israel. All the males were enjoined to come up three times in the year to present themselves, to appear before Jehovah. And no doubt Satan also came on these occasions; this applies also to our own times, for he undoubtedly comes on occasions like these "Satan came also". One can understand how in Israel he would have in mind to frustrate the designs of God in these holy convocations, to mar them, as he might find occasion to do; as the tribes met on the streets of Jerusalem, or in the environments of Jerusalem, the hills and vales, evil feelings of jealousy might arise, natural feelings might prevail, some other motives beside those primarily designated might be there-personal motives. Any or all of these conditions would give occasion to Satan, who would be there on his nefarious business to corrupt, to promote evil feelings or rivalry. We read, indeed, in this very book of Zechariah that on one occasion Joshua the high priest was there, and Satan was there; it was not simply that he also came, but that he was there to resist, to resist God in what He intended to do with
{322}
Joshua the high priest. God had in mind to bless him; Satan had in mind to prevent the blessing, to resist the angel of the Lord. This is ever his mind when God was about to bring Israel into Canaan, Satan was ready to curse, to have Israel cursed, if he could, and alas! he had a ready instrument in a hireling, one who would do it for the reward of unrighteousness.
But the word in Job is very searching because God said, 'Now, Satan, why are you here?'. God challenges the devil, and He would challenge everyone too: 'Why are you here?'. "Whence comest thou?", He says, as you may remember, in chapter 1: and Satan answered Jehovah and said, "From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it". That is his account of himself. God would bring that out. It does not appear that he was attacking any one person of the sons of God; perhaps God did not allow it. He frustrated him; He challenged him about job. He gives him something to answer, "Whence comest thou?". The probing question is, Why am I here? What is my motive? Satan answers; he could but answer to Jehovah. Thank God, God has control of him, and he answers immediately, and says, "From going to and fro in the earth". It is an unsettled, and yet not an aimless movement; like a bird or a beast of prey, that is the idea: "to and fro in the earth". And if there were any other thing to cause more deliberateness, "walking up and down in it", he says. Think of that! He had evidently a free hand. And he has yet, as Peter says, "as a roaring lion walks about seeking whom he may devour"; he has a definite object, preying, seeking anyone, even the Son of God, for he attempted it. It is impossible that he could overcome Him, but still he did not turn aside; he tempted the Lord Jesus. But now he is seeking whom he may devour, anyone who is likely to be in his way, and give him the opportunity
{323}
of turning such aside, young or old, into light, frivolous, vain pursuits. He is waiting for you. Well, all this is very searching and solemn, seeking whom he may devour. God says, "Hast thou considered my servant Job ... ?" (verse 8). How pleasing it was to Jehovah at that time that there was one whom He could call His servant. One always hesitates to apply the term to oneself, and yet it should be applicable to every one of us. God loves the term. When one was maligned God said, "My servant Moses: ... Why then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?", @Numbers 12: 7, 8. He says, "My servant Moses", "My servant David", too, "My servant Job" and many others. "Hast thou considered my servant Job?". Satan answers immediately, 'Yes, I have considered him'. I do not suppose that he would answer everyone that way, for he conceals his designs as much as possible, but not before God. All things are naked, especially Satan's motives: "All things are naked and laid bare to his eyes, with whom we have to do", @Hebrews 4: 13. Satan knew that, and he boldly argues with God as to this servant, "Hast not thou made a hedge about him ... ?".
'Now, I cannot do anything to him'. That is very comforting, God's taking care and protection of His servant. It is very comforting to notice the connection with the word 'care' and the word 'servant'. The importance comes into it of addicting oneself to divine service, for divine care comes with it.
Well, now I come to these bay horses in Zechariah. There were four groups mentioned in this prophet. I read the seventh verse, because it uses the word 'walk'. This word is not employed, as far as I know, in regard to the first three chariots but is used in connection with the strong horses in the fourth chariot. The word 'walk' is applied by the Spirit three times, and not to any of the other horses. You cannot say an aeroplane walks, or a train or a motor car. Walking
{324}
is deliberate. God set the pace, as I said before; He is said to have walked in the garden in the cool of the day. All that was deliberate. God never does anything save in deliberateness. He would have us to understand that; no one walking in faith should do anything save in deliberateness. Think of what you are doing. Take counsel if necessary: "In the multitude of counsellors there is safety", @Proverbs 11: 14.
Sometimes it is wiser to take counsel with oneself rather than with a multitude. Nehemiah says, "I consulted with myself". Sometimes that may be necessary, for God gives us wisdom. If any man lack it, let him ask of God, and He will give it to him. And one retires to himself, as before God, and takes counsel. We find that these four strong horses walk, as I was saying, with deliberateness. The idea is true of Christ especially; He walked no more in some places. He moved, like the type, in the calf-like, firm, careful step that attaches to walking; and every man of faith, if need be, may take counsel with others, take counsel with the Lord; the Lord will give understanding. Let no one be in the dark; yet Nehemiah says, "I consulted with myself". There are things that you yourself have got to deal with. To bring in another only beclouds the position. I have no doubt that the cells in the temple, in Solomon's and in Ezekiel's temple, would mean isolation in that way, getting by yourself. But then, as I said, walking, the very action, involves deliberateness, and it is applied three times to these strong horses and not at all to the other three kinds. There are four chariots, but only in connection with this one do we find the idea of walking. And I want to speak about that, dear friends, as having a special application to the present time. These chariots refer to the four gentile monarchies; it is Zechariah's way of presenting what Daniel presents more fully. We learn here that they are the four spirits of the heavens: "These are the
{325}
four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth", @Zechariah 6: 5. Now this is to be observed carefully and prayerfully; I say prayerfully, because they come into the range of individual exercise in such a peculiar way; they are not distinctively of the world. Christians often becloud their minds and hinder their prayers and their outlook by regarding the powers that be as distinctively of the world. They are not. The persons who rule may be, viewed separately, but not in their office. Their office is not of the world. And what we have here is more than the office; it is the actual powers themselves: "These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth". Well, you say in your mind, that cannot be so-and-so, and so-and-so. But it means the four monarchies, the Babylonish, the Persian, the Greek, and the Roman; they are as much in God's service, in principle, as was Israel under David and under Solomon. The first monarch of these monarchies was Nebuchadnezzar, and he is called by Jehovah "my servant". Indeed, God speaks to someone else, and says, 'I must pay that man wages, for what he did to Tyre'. Now this would never enter into our minds if we read profane history and confined our minds to it; nor would we get spiritual thoughts from these histories. We get all the thoughts that we need morally from the Scriptures; not that we should not read history, but I am saying that, as christians, we want to read Scripture in regard to everything and understand that it has to do with everything that we need.
Another great ruler, Cyrus, is said to be God's anointed, and that was before he was born (@Isaiah 45: 1). Again Jehovah says of Cyrus, "He is my shepherd", @Isaiah 44: 28. Let anyone read the book of Isaiah and see what that means; how subservient he was. Some of us were saying a few days ago that the first great
{326}
monarch was converted by God; he was an idolatrous sinner, a cruel man, casting people into the fire, burning men without feeling, heating the furnace seven times more than usual, but that man was converted. He was converted as an emperor, and he proclaimed; he turned into a preacher, indeed. That is all to bear upon the present position right down to the present moment. Zechariah gets his own view of these four chariots, and we want to get that view, dear brethren.
Now verse 7 speaks of the last of the four horses, the one we have to do with. The third is said to have gone forth toward the south country; the first two go into the north country. It says, "See, these that go forth towards the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country". That is, they do something. These have done something, thank God! It is not simply that they govern the world, but that this power did something for God; they quieted His Spirit in the north country. That is not said of any of the others; certainly not of these strong horses. They refer to the Romans, and there is nothing to indicate that they reach any finality. This power is still existent; the seventh head is past; the final one is the eighth; it is to bear the character of all the others, presently to come up; and in the meanwhile, under certain circumstances, the beast, this power, is governing. There are ten kings; there are those that the number ten would mean; that I am at a responsibility, even though the empire has been submerged. The number remains, and all the present rulers of the world represent that, and God is supporting them. But there is nothing said here to indicate that this power reaches any finality, although we know from other scriptures that it reaches satanic finality in its final results. It does not quieten God's Spirit; it is the very acme of man's will supported by the devil. This scripture does not go on to that, but we understand;
{327}
indeed, we were called upon hundreds of years ago, if we had wisdom, to count the number. He that has it, it says, will do so, and then we are told what the number is, so that, dear brethren, we are brought into all this in a spiritual way, not in a mere sense of curiosity or as prophecy-mongers. There are many like that, just pursuing prophecy as they would any other subject. It is not like that; it is a question of what is spiritual. These powers are powers of the heavens; they come from before the Lord of all the earth. Let us not put it forth into any abstract or theoretical position; it is a practical thing. This thing that I am speaking about is existent at the present time, but it is still under God. This power crucified Jesus; this power martyred the apostles, some of them, but still it retains its status as one of the spirits of the heavens, who stand before Him who is the Lord of all the earth. And so they go forth. We can see, dear brethren, where we stand; we are exactly in the path that Christ was. He had to do with an emperor, but it is the same power. He says, "Thou hadst no authority whatever against me if it were not given to thee from above", @John 19: 11. He answered Pilate carefully; He says, 'I was born King'. Pilate was not born a king; nor was any emperor, for a king is made of God, really. Jesus was born King, the real thought of God, in that precious blessed Man, and He told Pilate this, as much as to say, 'You should know you have power from on high, and I am respecting it'. Then Pilate felt his first thoughts were right, and that is what I would impress upon you. He says, 'This Man is innocent; I find no fault in Him at all'. You see that belonged to his office. He failed in that; he retreated in that, in cowardice. He failed, but the thing was there. God had empowered him; he had the right thought, and God would have helped him. And it is for us now to pray for these men that if they get the right thought they may stand by it. It is for
{328}
us to pray for them, that God will make them do it. Now I have in my mind to speak about walking as three times over it is connected with this power. And in the first instance, it is because they wanted to do it, as you will notice. "The strong go forth"; that is their own act, "and seek to go that they may walk to and fro through the earth". That is their own act. That was in their minds, you see, imperialism. Well, then the next word is, "Go". It is not as if they were in the way, but "Go, walk to and fro through the earth". 'You want to do it-God says you are to do it'. God will use them. Balaam professes to say, I would not go if Jehovah did not send me, but he wanted the reward of unrighteousness, and if these powers want to walk up and down through the earth, they are thinking of conquest, aggression and spoil. But God says, I will have to say something about this, and in spite of themselves they will have to do something for God, as Balaam had to do something for God. At the right time God came in; Balaam says, I am going; God says, I see you are going; go then. And He let him go, and He stood before him in the way and would have slain him, but He let him go, as much as to say, I will let you go for a purpose. And so it is with these powers. God will let them go, but He says, 'I will use them'.
"They walked to and fro through the earth", and they are doing it yet. These great Roman roads that are historic; everyone that knows anything about history knows what the Romans roads are; those of us who go to Europe see them; they are not to be surpassed. They are not roads made out of by-paths, or cattle trails; they are cut straight through; they are engineered straight through; they are intended to be walked on, and that no more time should be taken to walk on them than is necessary. They were not for amusement; they are for a purpose; they are for walking to and fro through the earth. That is the
{329}
intention of their makers, and they did that. How the Roman legions did tread these roads! They walked; that is the reason why I am stressing this point. They walked; that is, they did everything with deliberateness, and with a purpose. But God used them nevertheless. They did not perhaps know. God says to Cyrus, You do not know Me, but that is My thought about you; you are My elect, and you are My shepherd; showing how God uses persons and things who may not understand that they are being used. God can do anything. And so the fact is that they walked; the apostle was wont to walk from Jerusalem round to Illyricum. How did he do that? It was probably a distance of a thousand miles, which was immense in those days. He took the ways of Rome, the ships sometimes, but the roads other times. What did he take those ways for? Did he say, I will not walk on those roads, because the Romans made them? No. They were heaven's servants when they made those roads, and he used those roads. And so it is today: take the highways of the world, what are they for? What is heaven thinking about? Heaven is thinking of those that go forth, not for conquering nor for conquest, but to preach the gospel, to serve the Lord. The ships of the Atlantic and the Pacific, and the railways, or whatever they may be that are legitimate and usable, are heaven's; they belong to heaven. These powers are the four spirits of the heavens, whatever their motives. We are not thinking of that; we are thinking of God and His mind about it. If He gives His wind to blow and His rain to come down, He gives these too, to serve us. How it enlarges our view and robs our minds of mere international feeling and politics! These are the four spirits of the heavens sent out from standing before God, who is the Lord of all the earth. They go to and fro through the earth. Paul does it, and Peter does it; millions of others have done it, and
{330}
these same roads were made to be walked upon to preach the gospel. "I have fully", he says, "preached the gospel of Christ". What a moral triumph for us!
But I speak of this walking, so that we might have in mind these powers and pray for them, as the four spirits of the heavens, so that the enemy may not have it all his own way with them. He will have his own way presently, for he is the dragon who gives all his power to the beast and the false prophet. He is not doing that yet; Satan is walking up and down through the earth. But the Roman roads thwarted him sometimes; they were not always available to him. Paul walked those roads and spoilt the enemy's goods in walking those roads; they are not always available to him, nor can Satan do what he likes today with the powers that be. He is attempting to do it, but he cannot do all he wishes to do; he has to wait. And our business in this respect is to make it as difficult as possible for Satan to succeed, and in that sense to pray for these powers that God may force them, as He can do. It is a question of horses here; they are directed by the bit and bridle so that God may move them by external influences to do His will. He is doing that with most of the nations, and He will do it, as we pray.
Well, now, I have dwelt on that more than I intended, but over against that I wanted to come to the walk of Jesus. Indeed, it is concurrent with these horses walking, but think of the difference between the walk of Jesus, and the walk of those strong horses. What a difference! Whether it is Pilate or any of those Roman procurators, or military officers doing what they wished to do, Pilate mingling the blood of the Jews with their sacrifices-what a vicious, lawless, cruel thing to do-a wicked man. Think of Jesus walking alongside Pilate! We get it here in these verses; it is a sacrificial walk; it is the Lamb. He is
{331}
not said to be the Son of God here, nor the Lord, nor even Jesus, although He is always that, but John calls Him the "Lamb of God". "Behold the Lamb of God": that is what he says at this time. Why does he say that? The previous day he had said, "Who takes away the sin of the world", and he says, "I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God", @John 1: 34. But here it is just this one statement, "Looking at Jesus as he walked, he says, Behold the Lamb of God". That is all: "as he walked". He may have looked upon Pilate as he walked; he looked upon Herod, but what could he say? He did say something to one of the Herods; it was part of his mission to reprove, to make a way for the Lord. It was part of his mission. But he looked upon Jesus as He walked, and said, "Behold the Lamb of God". It is the sacrificial walk. That is all I want to press upon you, that to walk in the world alongside these horses is a sacrificial walk instead of a self-assertive walk, instead of a selfish walk, instead of an ambitious walk, desiring to be something in this world; it is a sacrificial walk. That is what the Lamb of God means all through Scripture; it means sacrifice. Well could John understand such a walk as that; he was himself on that line, a sacrificial line: he was born a priest, his father a priest, his mother too, you might say; he was in the deserts until the days of his showing to Israel, his clothing of camel's hair, a leathern belt around him, and his food, locusts and wild honey, none of the delicacies of the city, none of the finery of the tailors or the clothiers, no thought at all of being anything in this world. He was in the deserts until the time of his showing to Israel. Most young people who are to be shown in a public way, who are to be politicians, or doctors, or lawyers, or military men, must be trained; the day of their showing is ever in view, but the training, the colleges, whatever it be, is all necessary; how zealous the
{332}
parents are, even sacrificing themselves to make a show of their sons and daughters. Not so Zacharias and Elisabeth; no! Sent into the deserts, he was there without any resistance on his part evidently. There was nothing for the flesh; it was self-sacrificing love, you might say, in one who before he was born was joyous at the very voice of the mother of Jesus. Think of what a man he was! And this is the man, when Jerusalem would make him something in this world, who says, "In the midst of you stands ... he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose". And then, "A man comes after me who takes a place before me". That is John the baptist. And now he is looking at Jesus as He walked.
He had never seen, I am sure, such a walk. His eyes are able to discern such a walk as that; it was a self-sacrificing walk, beloved brethren. There it is. He says, "Behold". That is all he said. You might say his work is done, and now his disciples, as we have often had it, left him; that is another test, you know, to have your disciples leave you. You do not like that; if you are a teacher you like to have disciples. They were his disciples. He had been a wonderful teacher, but they left him. What a test! They followed that One; his voice directed them to that One. So we are indeed in the presence of a walk, dear brethren, that we are to imitate, to emulate and imitate; we are to walk in His steps we are told; in His very steps, meaning those details in every step. And so these two heard John and followed Jesus.
That is what they did. Maybe there is someone here who has never done that yet, and the Lord is saying to you, 'Now is your time to begin'. They heard John speak, and followed Jesus, and Jesus took notice of them. He loves to do it. He just loves to do that; to see your heart turn in that direction, away from the world to follow that self-sacrificing Man, for it is a sacrificial walk. You say, I am going to be that; I
{333}
am going to follow that Man, and in order to follow Him, I want to be taught. And so today, a good deal of the weakness among us is the lack of teaching. One is amazed and distressed at times to note how little is understood in ministry. These two men were not simply taking up one position, and saying, 'We are going to follow this Man'. No; they say, "Rabbi". And if we need to be taught, we will say it-"Rabbi", Teacher. John says, 'You must know what that means; that word means "Teacher"'. That is what the Spirit of God says; do not forget it. These first followers of Jesus called Him "Rabbi", and what did it mean? It meant that they needed to be taught. They had been taught; they were already disciples. But they had to be taught again, or more, as it were. We get further information about that in the Acts, and they understood that. They wanted more teaching than they had, and they said,'We want to have it where You are living too'. "Where abidest thou?", they say. He says, "Come and see". The Lord, if He were speaking to us about that, would say to us, 'We had a good meeting', and they had; the Lord was delighted with it, and so He is delighted with us, and will be delighted with any of us who have never taken that ground in our souls before. He would say, 'It is a good day today; there are one or two young people who are turning their backs on the world; they want something better, and I am ready to give it to them; Come and see'. Tomorrow you will have a greater opportunity. We have had it today, but tomorrow is the day in which the Lord shines, the heavenly Man. Come and see. The brethren will be breaking bread tomorrow in remembrance of Me, and you will not be there, but you should be there. That is exactly what He would say to you: "Come and see"; even if you are not going to participate, Come and see, and see with right eyes; see as you should see. The Lord said to the disciples, "Blessed
{334}
are your eyes". Well, that is the kind of eyes to have eyes that are blessed by seeing wonderful things; seeing them in the sanctuary. One great servant says, "To see thy power and thy glory, as I have beheld thee in the sanctuary". That is where God shines. They stayed that day with Him. I suppose it was a Roman day; at least, I would call it, more accurately, John's gospel day, a twelve-hour light day; a twelve hour working day. Are there not twelve hours in the day? That is, from sunrise to sunset; they stayed there until the twelfth hour of that day.
Well, now, Romans is to show how this walk is entered upon by a believer in his learning days, in his initial education. There are many who in learning bring Ephesians in right away, and others bring in the gospels. You do not calculate what you are doing. Romans is the initial book for christians. It is not without significance that it is addressed to these very people who earlier were represented politically in the strong horses. Rome never quailed at anything, battle or whatever it was. Well, these are the same people, these Romans. "To you also who are in Rome", the apostle says. Now I want you to walk differently from those horses; they are able to walk; they walk in a military way in the way of conquest, in the way of cruelty, in the way of breaking to pieces and stamping everything as they go. But the apostle says, Now any Romans that I am writing to, I want you to walk differently; walk in newness of life. That is not as a Quaker, or a nun might walk, or a monk.
That is not the idea of newness of life. There might be something different in that. Jude says, "These are they who set themselves apart, natural men, not having the Spirit". What a terrible word that is! If you have the Spirit you will not separate yourselves from the saints; you will stay by them, and be with them. So the apostle says, I want you to walk in newness of life, and on this ground: "As many as
{335}
have been baptised unto Christ Jesus, have been baptised unto his death ... as Christ has been raised up from among the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in newness of life". That word 'newness' is not simply different, but it is that there was never anything like it in Rome before, even in its priesthood, for Rome had its priesthood: the emperors used to be deified, worshipped; there was plenty of religion in Rome, in spite of this cruelty, but there was never any religion like this, in newness of life, and the Spirit would urge it upon us tonight that the walk is to be like that of Christ; it is to be sacrificial. We are baptised unto Him, but unto His death; that was sacrificial. His death was sacrificial; it has dealt with all that I am as a Roman sacrificially, to the end that I should cease to be that and walk in newness of life.
And then finally in chapter 8, to fulfil the righteous requirement of the law; that is another thing; that is the application, not exactly that it is to be that way, but it is actually so, "that the righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh but according to Spirit". It is not simply in newness of life, but according to Spirit; that is, we have come to see that the Spirit is here in power; so that we walk no longer in the spirit of error, or merely by rule or precept, but in new power and in a spiritual way, by the Spirit. We walk after the Spirit, and every righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled in us. It was never fulfilled in Israel in this way; it never could be, as is said in Deuteronomy. It is only in the power of the Spirit that it can be fulfilled. But it is a great triumph that God, in christians, has a real Israel of God for the moment, fulfilling the righteous requirement of the law. It goes further in other scriptures, but it means that what Israel should have supplied for God is now supplied in the Romans, who had had their heel on Israel after the flesh, but who have now been converted by a Jew, an instrument of
{336}
God, or at least other instruments of God, converted and are walking in the Spirit, a complete change inwardly, not merely newness outwardly. So that whatever righteous requirement there was in the law is fulfilled there. It is a complete triumph in that sense in as few or as many of us as walk in the Spirit.
So may God help us in this thought of walking. We have the sacrificial walk of Jesus, and walking in newness of life, as baptised to His death, and walking in the Spirit as possessors of the Spirit of Christ.
{337}
DISCRIMINATION
@Luke 5: 32; @Luke 19: 10; @2 Timothy 2: 10; @Revelation 8: 3 - 6
In seeking to set out the gospel at this time what is in mind initially is to call attention to the discrimination that it makes. In making these remarks it is necessary to guard the truth that the gospel is for all; it is indiscriminate in that sense. God in longsuffering wills not the death of the sinner, but desires that all may be saved and come to a knowledge of the truth. That is a great general fact relative to the gospel, and I hope it will not be weakened in any of our minds in regard to the discrimination in detail which the gospel testimony makes.
In a general sense the discrimination is seen representatively in the word in @Acts 2: "The Lord added ... those that were to be saved", where the discrimination is in favour of "those that were to be saved". It is plain enough from that statement there were those who were not to be saved, and of course that is a more searching fact. Curiosity might enquire, How many are there? Indeed, they did enquire from the Lord Jesus Himself, but the Lord never answers mere curiosity. If there should be those not saved and are enquiring how many are to be or not to be saved, you will get no help. The word of the Lord to that man was, See that you are saved. It is your matter: "Strive with earnestness to enter in through the narrow door" (@Luke 13: 24), He says. To count the number of saved and unsaved would take up so much time; no creature could do it. The Lord puts the man on his own responsibility-You see that you are one of them. If there is one here unsaved, see to it that you are one of the saved. You may say, The Lord has to do it. But you have to do it too. Do not misunderstand. Peter says to some listening to
{338}
him, "Be saved from this perverse generation", @Acts 2: 40. You have to do it.
Someone is saying under his breath, He is not preaching the gospel; but what I am saying comes in under the discriminating character of the gospel. It is the working out of a great scheme and, through distinction, the great sorrowful and plain fact comes out, that some are not to be saved. The apostle Paul says, "If also our gospel is veiled, it is veiled in those that are lost"; there is that class of people. What is the history of those people? They are people that lend themselves to the devil. You can easily detect who they are characteristically. The God of this world blinds their eyes; they are unbelieving, and as unbelieving, they are exposed to the devil and he makes use of his advantage in blinding their eyes, "so that the radiancy of the glad tidings of the glory of the Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine forth for them", @2 Corinthians 4:4. That is a terrible thought. I hope nobody is in the state of an unsaved person here, but the fact that there may not be one such here will not hinder me in preaching at all, because the people of God are the best listeners to the gospel.
I do hope there is no unsaved person here; I do indeed. But if there should be one or more then it is a very solemn fact there are such people as 'lost'.
I have to point out the use of the word 'lost'; and the distinction that is made in the passage read in @Luke 19, "The Son of man has come to seek and to save that which is lost". Paul says of the lost that Satan has blinded their eyes as to the gospel; he is hindering them from coming in. To understand this statement contextually, we must see that what Paul says is one thing and what the Lord says is another. The Lord is discriminating in favour of the lost. Paul is discriminating against them.
I began with @Luke 5 which is a very pointed passage in regard to what I am remarking, for the Lord says,
{339}
"I am not come to call righteous persons, but sinful ones to repentance". We have to understand that word 'righteous' in its setting here or we shall be very, very much misled. We have to understand divine irony. It has in mind people who are not righteous, people who have elected to be that, and, in dealing with such persons in detail in the gospel service, we have great advantage in a word like this from the Lord Jesus Christ who calls people righteous and discriminates against them. Maybe there are such here; those who are church-goers, communicants and the like, but who have never repented at all. It is a habit of their lives to regard themselves in this way. The Lord has furnished preachers with a great weapon in dealing with such, and if there is one here tonight, what I am saying has relation to him. The Lord says He did not come to call you if you are in this way. You have elected yourself out of the class. You may have been spoken to times without number, and your habitual reply may have been, 'I never did anything wrong, anything out of the way; my parents are good church people ...' and so you are electing yourself out of the class the Lord came for-the class called 'sinners'.
You may say, I never take my place among them, but I will go this far, and say, 'God be merciful to us miserable sinners'. It is always in the plural. You belong to the class that says things but you do not mean that. If I speak to you individually you say, I have been a good churchgoer; I have never done anything out of the way. You may join with the congregation in the customary sort of thing, but you do not mean it. If I challenge you yourself, How about your sins? you may think there are none; you *mean* that you are a righteous person. If that is so, the Lord says, You are not in mind in this matter. That is a very serious matter; you are electing yourself out of the class the Lord came to call, "I am not
{340}
come to call righteous persons, but sinful ones". On your own showing you have nothing to repent of.
The matter of repentance is not collective. You are accustomed to speak with others of your sins, but you are not accustomed to speak to God in your closet alone. You must take your place in the class the Lord Jesus came to call to repentance.
In saying this I have no thought at all that you should be confirmed in your present attitude, because divine irony is intended to reach your conscience. You may be electing yourself out of the class the Lord had in mind when He came into this world. It says, "Faithful is the word, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners", @1 Timothy 1: 15. I do not wish to confirm you in the class of people you have elected yourself to be amongst. You are as much a sinner as anybody is. The man that said "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the first" was a righteous man in his younger days,, just like you! He asserted his righteousness and was blameless! I do not suppose there would be anybody more eloquent in asserting his blamelessness than that man, for while he really belonged to the class the Lord is discriminating against here, divine irony covered him.
There is thus hope for you, for that man was saved. In due course, under the Lord's gracious dealings, he came to see that he belonged to the class the Lord came to call to repentance. I do not suppose anybody repented more than the apostle Paul. The word 'repentance' in the gospel testimony is a continuous thing, and when the apostle Paul said he was the chief of sinners he had gone a long way. I think the Spirit of God held him back from writing it down until he could say it thoroughly-not he was the first, but "I am the first". The more spiritual a man is down here, the more he carries along in his soul the sense of lawlessness-what he once was and what he now is.
{341}
Paul says, "By God's grace I am what I am", @1 Corinthians 15: 10.
In remarking this as to discrimination it is with the hope that if there is anyone here regarding himself righteous like Saul of Tarsus, you will see after all that you have been deceived. You have chosen the wrong class, having elected yourself out of the class the Lord Jesus had in mind when He came to this earth and now He will enable you to change your mind. If you remain where you are, you are lost eternally.
I go on to chapter 19 to speak about another discrimination. This time it is not the sinner to be called to repentance, but the lost to be saved. The two passages go together; but this one refers to a man's sins. Tax-gatherers were a class who were easily convicted of sin. If you only looked up the tax bills, they had been discriminating unrighteously; you could easily convict them of guilt. So when we come to Zacchaeus he was a man of that kind; he was a sort of extortioner. The Lord is in his house. He would come near to him. He was in Matthew's house too. These statements were both in tax-gatherer's houses. Matthew had made a great entertainment for the Lord. It is a remarkable thing the Lord should enter into his house, the house of a man of this kind, and that Matthew should have people there like himself. The Lord came under reproach in that way; He goes that far. The Lord goes so far as to be under reproach to get a soul. When He was baptised Himself He was under reproach. We are told expressly in Matthew that He came from Galilee. He does not evade the fact, nor does he disguise the fact that He was in the house of a man that was a sinner. They say of Him, "This man receives sinners and eats with them". If He is in the midst of sinners, He is the Saviour of sinners! He is just where He should be. It is right for Him to be there,
{342}
as it is right for Him to be on His Father's throne. He was where He should be-Blessed be His name! He was come amongst them to give them repentance, not that they should continue in their sins, but that they might be delivered from them and that through repentance sins might be forgiven.
So now, in his house Zacchaeus is not making an entertainment for Him, but the Lord is in his house seeking to save that which was lost. He is just where such people were. If there is one here now just beginning to feel his lost condition the Lord is at your side. He is standing by you and He has the greatest interest in a convicted sinner. The Lord would get down by your side and give you to understand that He is come to save you; it is His business in that sense. He is come as near as He can come; He has taken on this business to seek and save the lost. He has been seeking some of you here and not found an entrance into your heart yet. Zacchaeus let Him in. The Lord looked up at Zacchaeus. It may be the difficulty is you are too high up. This man was rich; he had a good bank account and that makes a man elated; rich people sometimes have a way of making you feel they are rich people. He was accustomed to be high up. No matter who a man is, if he has money he says, 'I can afford to be that'. The Lord came to where he was and looked up at him, and He says, "Zacchaeus", calling him by name. One of the most touching things is to be called by name by God; think of that! Some men might say of him, 'I would not use his name; he has robbed me, charged me too much taxes; he is not fit to be taken into the mouth of a righteous person!'. The Lord took it up, He says, "Zacchaeus". He would never forget that!
If there is anyone here 'uppish', in a good position maybe, and rich, the Lord is looking up at you; He can do that. He is not one to honour you in *that*
{343}
position. He says, 'I am not coming up there after you'; He could not take such a place morally as that. He says, "Zacchaeus, make haste and come down, for today I must remain in thy house". Zacchaeus understood that. May God grant someone here like that may say to himself, 'I have been too uppish, I have been holding the people of God at arm's length'. The Lord is calling you to comedown; you are standing in your own way. He says, 'I have the greatest things in My heart for you and I will be with you all night in your own house'. What an advantage! The Lord of glory is going to be in your house tonight! You will see Him at His best, and I may add, He will see you at your best, because a man ought to be that in his own house.
Zacchaeus came down and received the Lord Jesus gladly into his house. The Lord can speak freely now. This man's house occasions an opportunity of speaking what He could not have said under the sycamore tree. He was a selfish man and a wealthy man that had a right to climb a tree to look at Jesus. The Lord could not say under that tree, "The Son of man has come to seek and to save that which is lost". Zacchaeus was not consciously lost. The Lord is working with you and it takes years sometimes to bring you to the point, but He speaks to you and of you accordingly. He announces a great principle in relation to you. The works of God are innumerable and the Lord says of them that the works of God should be manifested in you. The Lord refers to Zacchaeus as a "son of Abraham". He could not say that in the sycamore tree. This is a man that belongs to the sinner class publicly. The Lord did not call him 'son of Abraham' in the tree, but in his house. What a gesture as he meets the Saviour at the door!
He values the gesture of faith. In receiving the Lord he did so gladly, and tells Him immediately how he paid back fourfold if he had robbed anyone. What a
{344}
meeting! Would you not like to have a meeting like that with Jesus? Come down! Do not stay up there! People in your class are a mutual admiration society, but this man detached himself from all that and he meets the Lord Jesus. No one would welcome more the gesture of faith at this man's own door than the Lord Jesus. He led Him in. The Lord says, in @Revelation 3, "Behold, I stand at the door and am knocking". He is knocking here tonight and wants you to let Him in. Zacchaeus was ready to let Him in and as in the house of Zacchaeus, He ennobles him.
Never was he a greater man than now; the Lord of glory is conferring glory on him. He alone can. Not only does He possess it, but He administers glory as the lost soul takes his place at the feet of the Saviour. He says he is "a son of Abraham". He stands out. That is a great thought that has been used of God many times since He came: "The Son of man has come to seek and to save that which is lost". For the present the neuter is enough, "that which"; but in being called "son of Abraham", Zacchaeus is dignified by the Lord of glory.
This is discrimination, to save that lost man by coming into his house. As he took the place of the lost he came under the direction of Christ; it is impossible morally for anyone to come into the divine presence except in subjection. There was glory shining as that man moved down from the tree, the glory of obedience, and the man is ennobled in his own house. It is the principle on which I am speaking tonight; it is on the principle of faith. Obedience has moral glory and I do not hesitate to say that, from the moment he began to get down from the tree, he is covering himself with moral glory. The Lord recognises him as a son of Abraham on the principle of faith. He came to save him. "The Father has sent the Son as Saviour of the world", @1 John 4: 14.
Marvellous thought! David said, "Is there not a
{345}
cause?"; there was a cause and this is the business on hand tonight. If you take your place as a lost sinner, He has come to save you. Is that not glad tidings? It is. The gospel is that you might be saved and then that you might adorn the gospel, for ennoblement is just that. Another son of Abraham is added to his family.
The next discrimination is in favour of the elect. The apostle Paul in this passage in 2 Timothy says that he endures all things for the elect's sake. We are on the line of the elect, which is a great doctrine; we are not to be afraid of it, everything is on that principle. Of course, when I use the word I must think of those who are actually so. The New Testament abounds in designating those who are the Lord's through faith, but then there are those who belong to the elect that are not yet known. The apostle Paul towards the end of his service considered he must not leave one of these out. He said, "I, from Jerusalem, and in a circuit round to Illyricum, have fully preached the glad tidings of the Christ", @Romans 15: 19. That was for everybody; it was a great general thought with him. How many times the glad tidings resounded throughout those territories of Asia Minor and Greece, the territories now known as Bulgaria and along the Adriatic. How heaven delighted in the great evangelist carrying the gospel! "Woe to me", he says, "if I should not announce the glad tidings". Necessity was laid upon him; he is personally under reproach. He says, virtually, 'I must not leave one of the elect out, they must all be brought in', and that is the present attitude.
Christianity has been received world-wide. There are some five hundred millions of christians, nominally, in the world, I understand, about one quarter of the whole population. They are rapidly becoming apostate. The elect are a class in the mind of God and the apostle is concerned about them; he is
{346}
enduring all things for their sakes; this gospel meeting is on account of them; it may be there are some of them here. We can only tell as they show it, but the apostle is enduring all things on their account. What prayers there were from the prison at Rome! There were marvellous references to prayer in that wonderful servant, and now as we think of the elect that they should be saved, we are not only thinking that, but that they may obtain salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. It is beyond the reach of the devil. It is not a salvation that lies in works or church-going, it is a salvation which is in Christ Jesus. It can never be touched. Those in it are immune from that point of view from all the powers of the devil and hell. It is a fixture. Think of that! Everything is being shaken. What uncertainty is in the air! The foundations are in question. How important therefore it is we should be in this, that we should obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus. It is for christians. One is stirred to think of it! To obtain the thing with eternal glory is the divine mind. We are at the end of the gospel period and there must not be one left out. It is finishing up, but they must obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus. Is it not worth something to go in for it? This is a wonderful thing, "the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory".
Now a final word in connection with the passage in Revelation. It is a word as to judgment, and there is discrimination against certain persons and in favour of certain things. It is only as to principle that I refer to it; certain things are in favour; they do not come under this head of punishment. "And it was said to them, that they should not injure the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but the men who have not the seal of God on their foreheads". These things are immune, but I am discriminated against. That is a terrible thing! One may have to
{347}
say, This terrible thing is to happen to me and not to these things; the judgment of God passes the green fields and comes to my house. It may be a good house, a well-ordered house like the rich man's, but the judgment passes all the green fields and enters my house. He gets at me where I am. Why is it? What is the reason of it? The Spirit of God says here that it is "the men who have not the seal of God on their foreheads". There is no question of piled-up sins, it is just this one thing. They have not the seal of God on their foreheads.
I know there is a dispensational setting to this passage, but I am making an application. The preacher is entitled to use it with the wisdom that God gives, rightly dividing the word of truth. There is a certain class of people, and the only reason why this penalty is inflicted upon them is that they have not the seal of the living God on their foreheads. Some young people may say, I have not the Spirit of God. The allusion here is to chapter 7. Most of us in this room are sealed with the seal of the Spirit after we believed. We have got it. Others I am speaking to, the Spirit of God is at work with them. In chapter 7 we are told about the seal of the living God. God is sealing certain persons and they are immune from judgment. That is, all of us here who have the Spirit of God are immune from wrath. Not a tremor rises in our hearts as the thought of going to be with the Lord or death is presented to us. But how about some of you young people? you have not got the seal of the living God. Divine wrath will seek you out; He will pass over the green fields, your garden and all you have, and come to you, as of old the destroying angel got into the house in Egypt and found the first-born in each house. Although there were many boys and girls in those houses, he would make no mistake; he found the first-born. A bow at a venture found Ahab (@1 Kings 22: 34), although
{348}
he was disguised. There would be no mistake. It was divine accuracy. The executor of God's judgment finds those people; he is looking for them; he goes into the town and finds them all. What is the guidance he has? "The seal of the living God"-that is all.
We have a more serious matter in a way later, in the reference to five months under the wrath of God. David says that he would fall into the hands of God, and God spoke to the angel; and he put up his sword into its sheath (@1 Chronicles 21: 13, 27). In this awful thing men are not allowed to die; it is the principle of judgment.
It says in @Revelation 14, "And another, a third, angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any one do homage to the beast and its image, and receive a mark upon his forehead or upon his hand, he also shall drink of the wine of the fury of God prepared unmixed in the cup of his wrath, and he shall be tormented in fire and brimstone before the holy angels and before the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment goes up to ages of ages, and they have no respite day and night who do homage to the beast and to its image, and if any one receive the mark of its name. Here is the endurance of the saints, who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus".
"And I heard a voice out of the heaven saying, Write, Blessed the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth. Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; for their works follow with them", @Revelation 14: 9 - 13.
This is one of the most terrible scriptures you can read. It is a continuation of what I have been speaking of. In one case it is the absence of the divine mark, in chapter 14 it is the presence of another mark. The absence of the divine mark is simply making way for another mark that calls down judgment. We are in the time when these things are and the divine mark is
{349}
being received and people are being "sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise". But the time will come when the discriminating judgment of God will find its objects; divine wrath will find its objects without the slightest possibility of error.

SPIRITUALITY AS SEEN IN JACOB
@Genesis 30: 25; @Genesis 32: 24 - 30; @Genesis 33: 7; @Genesis 37: 3; @Genesis 48: 14
I wish to speak at this time about spirituality and I have selected Jacob as illustrative of a believer's progress in this great matter. I believe I have made right selection and the fact that it is said that God loved Jacob hundreds of years after he died confirms the selection. God is a Spirit. Spirituality flows out of what God is, and it is necessitated by what God is. First it is that which is natural, and afterwards that which is spiritual (@1 Corinthians 15: 46). The spiritual is final, and corresponds with what God is. Unspirituality renders us unsuitable for God, untrustworthy too. Nothing is much more objectionable than untrustworthiness. So we read of certain who believed on the Lord Jesus on account of the signs which He manifested, but the Lord did not commit Himself to them; it is a very humiliating thing if the Lord has to retire because unspirituality comes into evidence in those who would make profession of Him. He did not commit Himself to them, it says, and immediately the Spirit of God introduces the subject of new birth as if the Spirit would say that aside from this and the development of it there can be nothing for God; He must remain alone, whereas His thought is to surround Himself with myriads in the relation of sons, that relation involving spirituality.
So the Lord speaks of the necessity of new birth to a man who met Him, came indeed to Him by night, and said to Him, "We know that thou art come a teacher from God", @John 3:2. Nicodemus was exercised and that led him to say this to Jesus: "We know that thou art come a teacher from God". A very fine remark! one of the best he made. He made many afterwards, as we know, but some of them were
{351}
not very luminous. His most spiritual service was to bring one hundred pound weight of spices to embalm the Lord Jesus when He was dead. If we only had believers like Nicodemus as he is presented in Scripture, we would have persons who knew something about new birth but knew very little about the assembly, very little about the heavenly calling. He remained in the council although he was a disciple, but he did not follow the line of separation to become a real disciple of Jesus. There were many secret disciples, sorrowful though that is, because they are cowardly-and they are owned in heaven. As I said before, Nicodemus came out into the open to bury Christ, although to attend the burial was not in itself so very much. He attended the burial of Christ and embalmed Him, and did so quite liberally. Immediately after that we have the record of Mary Magdalene in @John 20, but there is no word of Nicodemus as being in the new company, the new circle whom the Lord Jesus addresses and speaks of as His brethren. I do not say he was not; he was, I believe, and so was Joseph of Arimathaea, too, but there is no further word of them. It may be there are those present who are like that, secret disciples. Why not take courage in your heart, in your hand, and come out boldly for Christ? You will be on the winning side, as it is said, "Who is he that gets the victory over the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God?", @1 John 5: 5. He comes out of heaven, a great Warrior, presently, His name is called The Word of God, and He is completely victorious over all His foes. There will be no need to be ashamed of Him then, nor is there now. There is an urgent call to be out and out for Christ. Nicodemus began with a good remark, and finished with a fairly good deed, but still we cannot look at him as a glorious witness for Christ, one of Christ's brethren.
Now, the new birth underlies those who are the
{352}
brethren of Christ, and that is why it is brought in in @John 3, because that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. The spirit is an element in itself, a germ, as it were, in my person, which develops and develops and develops until the natural is superseded by it. There is first that which is natural, afterwards that which is spiritual, and that is final. We are not worth much without that: we are not worth anything unless we are born anew, whatever our attainments. We are not worth anything to God or for His testimony.
I have selected Jacob because he represents this great idea in the Old Testament more than any other I know. Even as a babe, he was moved on the principle of spirituality; he supplanted his brother. His brother was Esau, and he has to be supplanted because he is the natural man, the man of the field, the man of sports, the man who despised the inheritance of God. That man is worth nothing; he is in the way, and Jacob supplanted him and obtained the inheritance and never lost it. He valued it; all spiritual persons value the inheritance of God. Jacob was quite an oldish man when Joseph was born, and his practical spirituality, his sustained spirituality, begins with the birth of Joseph. Joseph is a type of Christ. I intend to speak of him in that way. Of course he was a literal son of Jacob, a babe, a boy, and a man like others, but he was a type of Christ and particularly in this matter. He appears in the midst of a family; Jacob was the head of a large family by this time. Joseph was his eleventh son. A large family is no detriment to a christian; in fact, to elect to have a small one is a detriment. God works in families. Jacob had ten sons already, but he had said nothing about moving out of Padan-Aram to get back to his own place. That is the spiritual side of the matter, as he says here, "Send me away, that I may go to my place and to my country", @Genesis 30: 25. That is the christian, typically; he has got his own place and that
{353}
is not this world. That is not the world of the theatres, or the world of sports. Esau's world was that, not Jacob's. He was a plain man, we are told, and dwelt in tents, meaning that he was a pilgrim; that was what characterised him in Canaan. But he had got out of the way; he had been away for twenty years from his own place, his own country; and now he would return. It is a great moment in the believer when this thought arises, and especially if it arises in the head of a family. God can speak to a man through one of his children, if he himself for the moment is not expressive of Christ, although a true believer; one of his children may be and that was so with Joseph. The Spirit of God does not tell us just what it was, but He does say that as Rachel bore Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, "Send me away, that I may go to my place and to my country". There is surely some suggestion in that child, that son, that he had not observed in the others. It was not in the others. You take, for instance, the firstborn in which fathers pride themselves. His mother says, 'A son!', as much as to say, 'Wonderful!'. That was what she said about Reuben. We think our children are wonderful, but they are not really as wonderful as we think. But a son was a wonderful thought with her. But Jacob's comment many, many years later throws cold water on that. We have to wait and see what these babes are going to be. Excellency of dignity, beginning of my strength, says Jacob-my firstborn, but alas! impetuous, unstable as water (@Genesis 49:3, 4). That was what Reuben was, you see, the firstborn. Well, I cannot go over them all, but would just touch on that; the firstborn, you see, may be a great disappointment. Then we have a Simeon; we have a Levi; we have a Judah; one after another, a name given to each, and why? So on down, covering all the ten of them; not a very happy family, you know. It often strikes one, the unsightliness of that family at
{354}
first, the hatred between the two sisters, and the rivalry, and many other things. But still it was the twelve tribes that were coming on, and here is the eleventh. There is something about him in the midst of all that scene of evil. You can see them all around, you know; Reuben, and Simeon, and Levi. Simeon and Levi-instruments of cruelty were in their habitations; these boys would have had knives in their pockets, and little pistols, if they existed. That is what they were. Let us not deceive ourselves as to what the flesh is. Then Joseph appears; there must have been something there peculiarly touching. He is from another land, as it were; his countenance bespeaks something else, as it is said of Moses, he was fair to God. Jacob says, I must go to my own place, to my own country, as much as to say, Joseph reminds me of that. How delightful it is in a family where there is great incongruity, great lack of affection and cohesion, to find a child like that. One child in a family becomes an influence, a saviour as it were, to pull out of the confusion into the heavenly side, into the believer's position. Well now, having said that, I go on to chapter 32 to show how Jacob was taught. He was on the way back, but he was alone; not now in the midst of his family, no Joseph, no Reuben, no Rachel, no one at all but Jacob. It is God and Jacob now. The head of a family has to come to that very often, to get away from all that is natural, to be with God; at least, to be alone so that God may be with him; to be alone with God. And that was what happened. You know the story: often used in ministry, rightly, but Jacob says, "I will not let thee go except thou bless me" (verse 26). He is on spiritual lines now.
"I will not let thee go except thou bless me": I want a blessing; if I am in touch with God I am at the source of everything; I want to get all I can. And He is ready to give. He does not wish you to go begging. I want a blessing, he says, and he gets it.
{355}
But he gets it at the same time in which he is crippled; that is, he is not to be the active money-maker that he used to be. He acquired great wealth by his cleverness as a cattle raiser; he did it for wages; his father-in-law changed his wages ten times. Such are fathers-in-law; I mean to say, the Spirit of God hides nothing; He brings everything into the light, whether mothers-in-law, fathers-in-law, sons, daughters or sisters; everything is exposed where God is. If God be not there, we can hide things; but if God be there, there can be no hiding for with God everything is naked and open to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do; not only so, but what is spoken, for "what ye have spoken in the ear in chambers shall be proclaimed upon the housetops", @Luke 12: 3. Jacob is alone with God, and he wants a blessing and he gets it; but he gets it as a crippled man, he limps. I touch on this for a moment, because it brings out the negative and the positive sides. As I advance in spirituality I become weakened in other respects; it is the mercy of God that it is so. If I prosper as my soul prospers, it would be well; but if I prosper beyond that to which my soul prospers, I need to be crippled, and God does that for me. He knows what to do.
Now we are told that it was a man that wrestled with Jacob, but Jacob does not call him a man. He calls him God; that is, he knows God when he sees Him; that is an important feature of spirituality. Hence, I can say God is there, as the man does that is affected by the prophetic word; he says, God is among you. He can tell His name is God; it is not the great gifts he is naming, the one who is speaking the prophetic word, but he says, God is among those people. That is spirituality. And so Jacob says, "I have seen God face to face, and my life has been preserved". He called the place Peniel, meaning 'Face of God'; he saw that. He is advancing
{356}
spiritually and God says, I am honouring the advance; your name is no longer Jacob, it is Israel, because as a prince thou hast prevailed and hast power with God and with men. That is a real tribute to spirituality. A man that has power with God in prayer gets answers from God, and has power with the brethren.
Well now, that makes room for Joseph. I just touch on the next chapter, this parade before Esau. He was not worthy of it: it was a remarkable parade, a parade of faith. How God would love to parade His people! He would do it and bring us out in glory when Christ is manifested, who is our life. We shall be manifested with Him; that is, everybody will see us. So here is the family of faith, the family of Jacob, and one after another, the children passing by before Esau and bowing, each mother and each son, bowing, all the children. And in the arrangement for the parade, so to speak, before Esau, Jacob puts Rachel and Joseph, Rachel first, which is, of course, what in a sense should be done, the mother first. That is Jacob's arrangement, but Jacob is now lame, he is no longer the self-assertive man he used to be. Why should there be a self-assertive man in a family? Where there is a self-assertive man in a family or meeting there is no room for Christ, there is not much divine movement. Self-assertiveness, making a show in the house or the family or the meeting will eclipse Christ and put Him out of view. But Jacob had been made lame by God, turned into a prince spiritually, and that means I make room for Christ. And so in the last mention of the family, Joseph and Rachel, Joseph has moved on. It does not say that Jacob put him there; it was the liberty, so to speak, that Christ had typically. He moved before his mother; room was made for him. Well, dear brethren, that is an important matter, that I be not self-assertive and domineering in my house or among my brethren. If I am self-assertive God would cripple me so that I make room for Christ, so
{357}
that Christ moves. Joseph moves before Rachel; he is not told to do it; he has liberty to move. There is liberty with Christ in those circumstances.
Well now, the next passage is in chapter 37: that is, that Jacob now loves Joseph. He loved him above all his brethren, all his sons. How fine that in a household or a meeting the leading man loves Christ, that is what marks him; he puts Christ before every brother and sister, before his own brothers after the flesh. He loved Christ; he loved Joseph. This is a very important point to reach in spirituality, because it is not the babe Joseph now, or even the boy. He is seventeen years of age, which is a very critical time for boys and girls, for they are then peculiarly exposed to the devil and if they are in any way affected by the devil they are very unlovable. Boy flesh and girl flesh at that age is very unlovable if it is unruly and it is wise for young people to take in all that, to stand against it. It is the most critical time with them, and that kind of flesh is very unlovable. But not so Joseph: how very lovable he is there! Only one member of the house developed into this at seventeen years of age; Joseph is the outstanding young man in Genesis, and he has got every virtue. You marvel at him. He is never overcome in his youthfulness. He comes out among the brethren to see them, sent there, but he hears their evil conversation. You know how young people are given to evil conversation; they cannot stop; their words follow each other, they overwhelm each other; they have so much to say, and yet they have nothing to say. But these brethren had something evil to say, filthy things, and Joseph resented that and told his father. That was one of the elements doubtless that affected his father. But still he is the seventeen-year-old son that is loved by his father who made him a coat of many colours. It is a vest really, not something for public show because a vest is underneath. Not the time for show yet; it is the time for
{358}
love and for the evidence of love in secrecy. He loved Joseph above all his sons, and signified it by making him a vest of many colours. The chapter is full of the glories of Joseph; everyone sinks into the shade but Joseph. Jacob recovers himself; he shines in the fact that he loved Joseph; but he rebuked Joseph for announcing his own glory, that is, the glory of Christ. The eleven sheaves bow down to his, the sun and moon and the eleven stars bow down to him, speaking of the glories of Christ. The chapter is full of the glories of Christ, the glories of Joseph, but Jacob rebukes him. But yet he recovers himself in measure in observing this saying. Fathers are often active in rebuking the children; one has to be careful, and if he makes a mistake correct himself before the children. But the chapter is full of the glory of Joseph; it shines brilliantly, and Jacob is just able to keep himself but no more; he is hardly able to do that. Still, there is something there to steady him, for he observed the saying. His brothers hated him; you could not conceive of Jacob hating Joseph. He is a spiritual man; a spiritual man would never hate Christ or what is of Christ. He may be under the power of the enemy for the moment, but he rescues himself, a most important thing. A spiritual man always finds a way of recovery.
In the last scripture, chapter 48, it is still Joseph. The history of Jacob's spirituality, I may say, is linked up with his son Joseph, as is the history of every true believer who loves Christ: his spirituality is linked up with Christ and it shines in the presence of Christ. Joseph now is a great man, no longer a boy of seventeen. He is the lord of all Egypt; his name is Zaphnath-paaneah, the preserver of the life of the world, the greatest man morally in those days. He was not greater than Pharaoh officially, but he was greater than all others except one, and that was his father. No son can ever be greater than his father in the ordering of
{359}
God. It cannot be so, and this must come out spiritually; it is not that the father cannot assert what is acquired in the way of wealth or light or experience, but it is the spiritual teaching that involves the greatness, for true greatness lies in spirituality. So Joseph sinks here and Jacob rises. He is in the presence of Joseph, and Joseph is in the presence of his father Jacob. Joseph was in every way right in his approach to his father and in his movements in meeting him and speaking to him; there was not a flaw in the movements or the speakings until Joseph came to the firstborn. We have been speaking about the firstborn Reuben, how his mother says, A son! What a great report that was! She had a son: Rachel did not have anything. See how she gloated over the advantage.
Eve did not call Cain a son; she said, 'A man'. "I have acquired a man with Jehovah". That is what she said; but Leah was full of the thought of a son and, of course, met with disappointment and so did Jacob. Now Joseph has two sons: Manasseh is the elder and Ephraim the younger; they are brought from between his knees; he loved them both, but he must have loved Manasseh better than Ephraim. He was short of spirituality; he was a spiritual man, but he was not as spiritual as Jacob. It is well to have measures, you know; one of the most important things in the divine domain is that of values, what things are worth. God makes much of that with no error whatever; everybody has his true value in the presence of God and sooner or later what one's true value is will come to light. This is the supreme moment for Joseph, and he fails in spirituality. Jacob shines in it, showing how deeply he was immersed in the thought. He had the root of it from the very outset; he supplanted Esau and acquired lovableness in the presence of Jehovah so that Jehovah loved him. In his last moments Jacob shines in spirituality. I know of nothing of more value to present to the
{360}
brethren than this: not only to aim to die a spiritual man, but to live one, every day a spiritual man, so that when matters come to you you are never at a loss. This is a remarkable situation; here was the lord of all Egypt; his father outwardly was much less a man; he was a sheep raiser; I suppose he bore the marks of his occupation when he was brought in before Pharaoh by Joseph. Joseph does not prime him as to what he should say to Pharaoh as he primed his brothers when they were brought in to Pharaoh. He told his brothers what to say, but not his father. He knew that much; he had that much instinct that he did not dare to tell his father what to say to the monarch, and his father is a spiritual man in the presence of the great monarch of Egypt. How old are you? he says. "Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life"; what beautiful words those were, full acknowledgment of what he was! "They do not attain to the days of the years of the life of my fathers", @Genesis 47: 9. But then he had already blessed Pharaoh, think of that! Think of what that was to heaven, that old shepherd, for that is what he was externally. One can understand the grandees of Pharaoh's kingdom saying, Who is that old man? That is Joseph's father. He was greater than Pharaoh; he blessed Pharaoh, he was equal to that. Without all gainsaying the less is blessed of the greater. It says twice over that he blessed Pharaoh; that was Jacob the spiritual man, the greatest man on earth, that is what he was; yet outwardly he was a shepherd, an abomination unto the Egyptians. Pharaoh did not ask him for his occupation, as I remember. He asked the five brothers. Joseph told them what to say, that they were cattle men. They were livestock people, and it was a disgrace, you know; in the eyes of the Egyptians it was a reproach to be of that occupation. But they were true to Jacob; see the greatness of the glory of the patriarch, the spirituality that shines,
{361}
with which he is clothed in the presence of the monarch. He blesses him and he went out from his presence; he is not sent out. It is all dignity, but spiritual dignity.
Well now, here is the lord of all Egypt, second to Pharaoh. He is Jacob's son, and he is in the presence of his father. He has two sons, the joy of his heart, and of course the elder is the chief one. He is on the line of nature. The Spirit of God does not seem to let anybody off, even the most spiritual, for there is something that is brought to your attention before you pass out of this scene of testimony. There is only one perfect Man who has been in the scene of testimony, and this is Jesus. So Joseph brings them out from between his knees. There is the old man: this is his right hand and this is his left hand, and Joseph comes to him and puts Manasseh next to his right hand, brings them out from between his two knees; there was no lack, but plenty of affection for the two boys, but there was lack of spirituality in the father, and that is a great matter to look into. We are so prone to think of the first-born, to think on the line of nature in regard to our sons and daughters, and the enemy would come in. And so the boys come from the place of affection and the old man puts his right hand over to Ephraim-the second born, although the firstborn, Manasseh, was there by Jacob's right hand. What a wonderful thing that is. How heaven watched that! How marvellous it seemed to heaven! Nobody else, perhaps, saw it, but the four of them, the father, the grandfather, and the two sons. There is Ephraim, and the old man, the spiritual man, in the full sense of the light and understanding of the divine counsels about that boy puts his right hand on Ephraim. The whole scene is full of spirituality, if I might say, in Jacob, but of fleshly-mindedness in Joseph. Do not forget it, this fleshly-mindedness in the great man Joseph in the presence of his father!
{362}
All this is to rebuke it in us, dear brethren, because something like this may well come up with us some day, perhaps in the care meeting, and I will be caught. I will put my right hand on my relative after the flesh and identify myself with him and give him the first place when it is not intended to be so. It is not the mind of God, and the lord of all Egypt with his lordly voice says, "Not so, my father"; not so, not so. Maybe he repeated it, I do not know, but that is what he said, "Not so"; that is, he rebuked what faith was doing, what spirituality was doing. You see if it was a care meeting Joseph would be all wrong and Jacob would be all right; but there would be confusion if there were such men in a care meeting, or in an assembly meeting. That is bringing it down to practical christianity; that is what happens. "Not so, my father". How often you hear words like that in assembly matters, words of authority, as if there was authority, when there is not any; there can be no moral authority with what is wrong. Joseph sinks; Jacob rises at this particular crisis and so Jacob says, "I know, my son, I know". He is very beautiful in his expression, "I know, my son, I know". He will be blessed too, but the younger shall be greater than the elder; the blessing must come on Ephraim. And it did. It is an object lesson for us as to how we progress in spirituality and how it shows itself in crises, in emergencies, that we are not taken by surprise and give way to our own minds, our own wills, and bring confusion in among the saints of God; whereas on the other hand, the spiritual man gives way to the mind of God, stands by the truth, and the light and power of the mind of God go through.
{363}
THE SPIRITUAL SIDE OF THE BREAKING OF BREAD
@Luke 24: 28 - 43
J.T. There are three points in mind: the first is that the Lord Himself actually broke bread after He rose; the second that He comes into the assembly as it is convened as certain things are proceeding, including the breaking of bread; and thirdly, that He does not take part in the breaking of bread Himself. What He has part in is what is subsequent; that is, what they have, as it were, on hand. He says, "Have ye anything here to eat? And they gave him part of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb" (verses 41, 42). But the fact that the Lord broke the bread after He rose is one to be considered for a moment, because it is the spiritual side of the breaking of bread. It was not done in the assembly, but still it was done and the tidings of it were carried into the assembly by those who had part in it. What happened during the forty days of the Lord's sojourn after He rose and before He ascended is part of the treasury of the assembly, part of what is in it; and this occasion of His in breaking bread after He rose is something to be considered; that is, the spiritual side of the matter. Chapter 22 gives us the formal or official part, where we have both the giving of thanks and the breaking of the bread and also the cup, but the breaking of bread is only mentioned here as taking place at Emmaus, but the tidings of it were carried into the assembly and the Lord comes in afterwards.
C.A.M. Are you stressing the fact that the Lord Himself was on the other side of death?
J.T. That is what I thought. In chapter 22 He says, "Before I suffer"; but now it is after He suffered. But still, He breaks the bread and vanishes
{364}
as He does it; and then the tidings of it are carried up by those who experienced the incident and the Lord comes in as they are speaking about it, as if that was the way, the spiritual side of the Lord's supper. Then He inquires as to what they had to eat; that is, what He could partake of. In no case does He take part in His own supper, the Lord's supper, but there is that which He does take part in. He took part in the passover before He instituted the Supper, and now He takes part in something else which they had. It is not what the Lord's supper brings in, but what is there additionally.
R.W.S. Is that why it is in a house setting?
J.T. I suppose that has to be taken account of. It was in a house, a family setting; but still, it does not say the Lord ate anything in that house. He sat at table and acted as house-father, and vanished as He broke the bread. It does not say that He ate anything there, but He does eat something in the assembly and it is not His own supper at all; it is something that is there otherwise.
C.A.M. What you say is a wonderful suggestion. Would you say that what we partake of in the Supper is on this side of death, but what the Lord enters into in the way of partaking is when our spirits pass over to the other side?
J.T. Why should there be this additional thought of the Lord's breaking bread before He left? There is no breaking of bread in the assembly, as far as is recorded, until after He went up to heaven and the Holy Spirit came down. They persevered in it, we are told, but why should this incident of the breaking of bread by Himself as risen from among the dead be introduced? It is not just the same as what chapter 22 furnishes; there we have the actual loaf the Lord Himself selected or took, and then following that, we have the cup. There is no cup at Emmaus, but there is this other thing, the breaking of bread and the Lord's
{365}
vanishing, which He did not do according to chapter 22. But here is the vanishing and disappearing by the Lord as He broke the bread, and the tidings of this incident carried into the assembly; and as they are speaking about it, He comes in. Is it to teach us that there is a double side to the meeting: what He did as instituting the Supper, and then what He did as risen, not in the assembly but somewhere else, and He vanished when He did it? What does that vanishing mean, and what is it as carried into the assembly, because they say, "The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to Simon. And they related what had happened on the way, and how he was made known to them in the breaking of bread" (verses 34, 35)? How He was; this is a question that has come to me here for the first time, whether this is not the spiritual side of the instruction and part of the treasury of the assembly and carried down to us.
C.A.M. Does the blessing of the loaf in the house convey anything more than the giving of thanks for it in the upper room? It says here that He blessed it.
J.T. "Having taken the bread, he blessed".
Giving of thanks and blessing, I think, have the same import.
C.A.M. I was thinking it would help us about the matter of whether the transfer from what is material to what is spiritual is not there in the breaking of bread. I mean it is the last touch really of earth. The material world of things is going to disappear for ever, but there is that secret touch to what is actually material every Lord's day at the outset of the meeting. Then there is the transfer, and this matter of the Lord's doing this when He was actually beyond death seems to me to show the meaning of it-how it becomes spiritual.
J.T. That is just what I had in mind. It is one of the incidents of a very full day. It is the first day after the Lord arose, the day on which He arose, a very full
{366}
day. And we get this incident of meeting those two who were going in the wrong direction, and they are inviting Him into the house, and He is accepting the invitation, being constrained to go in, and as they are sitting at table, this happens. This is a risen Christ. It was not a risen Christ in chapter 22. Luke's further account is that "He presented himself living, after he had suffered" (@Acts 1: 3), but this comes in between, this incident; He not only presented Himself but actually blessed the bread and broke it in the house and then vanished. The effect on those two is that they returned to Jerusalem and told this matter in the assembly; and as they are telling it, Jesus comes in again. There seems to be instruction there that we must make room for, evidently the spiritual side of the matter. It is not formally the Lord's supper, but a principal part of it, but there is a vanishing in this action. It must be the spiritual side here, which you can never get in the so-called 'sacrament' in the churches. It belongs to the assembly as linked with the forty days of the Lord's sojourn after His resurrection.
R.W.S. They are able to judge too, because without delay they relate what happened to the assembly in Jerusalem and how He was made known to them in the breaking of bread.
J.T. I was thinking of that. It is the 'how'; whether it does not point to the way the thing happened, whether that is not what is in mind, and have we missed this side of the matter? Perhaps we have not missed it, but in this setting. It is the second breaking of bread by the Lord Himself, but it is an assembly matter, because it is carried into the assembly by those who had part in it.
F.H.L. I suppose the vanishing at that point would intensify the thought of what is spiritual.
J.T. That is what I thought; that vanishing is the other end of the matter, at Emmaus sixty stadia away,
{367}
and links on here in Jerusalem almost immediately after the two arrived there, as if the Lord would join them. Surely there must be something for us to take up and look at and see whether we are governed by it.
T.E.H. Is this the second manifestation? He had manifested Himself in another form already to the two, but is this a second manifestation in the assembly?
J.T. Mark alone calls it another form. "And after these things he was manifested in another form to two of them as they walked, going into the country", @Mark 16: 12. Mark does not tell us about this incident in the house; it is the two going into the country, as though it were a discredit to them. He is manifested in "another form", but Luke brings all this into the assembly. Mark does not go so far.
Luke is working on the line of the assembly, and he is making an effectual addition, which is for the assembly.
The Lord is back in Jerusalem as they are talking together. They have just come in and are relating this matter, and He is there as they are saying that.
There must be a lot in that.
Rem. He does not disappear when they recognise Him in the assembly.
J.T. No; He is here to stay, so to say, in the assembly to open up other things, but He does not stay in the house to open up anything.
Rem. I was thinking of how He was made known but He disappeared; He did not support them in that position.
J.T. It is quite obvious He is not coming in to support them when their backs are on Jerusalem, but He is going to get them back so that the assembly will have something it did not have before. The recovery must mean something that the assembly did not have before.
Rem. That would be seen when Joseph made himself known to his brethren.
J.T. Yes, indeed; they were a richer family than
{368}
they were before; the enrichment of Jacob's family is a great point in Genesis, and what came into Egypt is made a point of in the beginning of Exodus. So this matter is very important, I think, that those erring ones, as the Lord appears to them, bring something into the assembly that was not there before.
Rem. They said, "Was not our heart burning in us as he spoke to us on the way?" (verse 32).
J.T. Just so; but then the heart-burning does not add to the assembly; it is what they are able to communicate. What the Lord said to them was so worth while that their hearts began to burn, but they were going to stay in Emmaus. The heart-burning did not bring them back to Jerusalem; it is the vanishing of the Lord that affects them.
W.C. On the way to Emmaus, their eyes were holden, but here their eyes were opened. Is that in view of the return?
J.T. Quite so: "And their eyes were opened, and they recognised him" (verse 31). It does not say who opened them. We are not told what had occasioned this. It is a subjective thing.
W.C. That followed the breaking of bread.
J.T. Yes; something happened to them; their hearts had been burning, but now their eyes were opened, which is more important.
R.W.S. They said something that had never been said before.
J.T. Yes; this is a contribution that the assembly did not have, and yet they are two people that had turned away from Jerusalem. The Lord has gone after them, and this is how He has appeared to them. They are persons capable of recovery quickly; and in the recovery they bring back something for the assembly.
T.E.H. Those at Jerusalem were saying that the Lord had appeared to Simon, and then they began to
{369}
say something, as if one appearing would disclose another.
J.T. I think so. That is a feature of Christ that erring ones are appeared to; first Peter and secondly the two on the way to Emmaus, see the Lord. That is a remarkable thing, and what marks the public body is grace on the one hand in restoring a man like Peter, a serious offender, and on the other hand, that these people are also spiritual; they were very spiritual although they were going in the wrong direction.
C.A.M. From their conversation on the journey, evidently they felt as if they had lost Christ; the One that they thought was Christ had apparently gone; but after this occurrence when there was a disappearance, they had not lost Him. They must have made a great advance in a spiritual way.
A.A.T. The two were adjusted, were they not? The Lord was with them in the breaking of bread; in fact, adjustment had to come about before the other incident took place. Is there any relation to @1 Corinthians 11 where they were to tarry one for another?
J.T. Do you want to convey the thought that the brethren in Jerusalem are waiting for those two?
A.A.T. There was adjustment apparently in Luke. And Paul gives instruction to tarry one for another, I suppose, in view of adjustment.
J.T. It would seem as though they might have tarried for them. They were apparently going on without them. "And they found the eleven, and those with them, gathered together, saying ...", that is to say, they did not hold up the meeting; they were going on. "The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to Simon" (verse 34). They heard them saying that.
They came in at that point. Why should they not go on with the meeting? But those two are going to add to it; the Lord intended that they were going to come in and augment the position. "And they related what had happened on the way, and how he was made
{370}
known to them in the breaking of bread" (verse 35). They were evidently late to the meeting. No wonder t They went the wrong way around, but still they got to the meeting and they got to it in time to add to it, and the Lord would not come in until they came, because this spiritual touch is certainly the point that is stressed. What the eleven and the others were saying would be from the standpoint of grace. The public assembly was to be marked by grace, but these two add the other side. They related *how* He was made known to them in the breaking of bread, so the question is whether we understand the meaning of *how* He is made known to us in the breaking of bread, not according to chapter 22, but how about this occasion?
F.H.L. It is quite evident it was the whole company and the instruction here is carried on to @Acts 2.
J.T. I think it belongs to the treasury, and what about it? Do we get to this side of the matter when we break bread?
R.W.S. Should we be able to say as to how He has come in?
J.T. That is what I must confess simply I look for, this spiritual touch; whether you can say, He has come in; whether you can say, It is the Lord.
W.C. They recognised Him.
J.T. Yes, they did, they had their eyes open. Those two, I believe, were the saving element in the assembly; they were equal to the matter.
C.A.M. Do you think when it says, "But they, being confounded and being frightened, supposed they beheld a spirit" (verse 37), these two were greater than that particular difficulty?
J.T. I should say so; I cannot imagine that they would be perturbed relative to the Lord's coming in as an apparition. This is just the thing we are at.
F.H.L. This would be the element in @John 20 as rejoicing.
{371}
A.N.W. There are three remarks made about what happened as He showed Himself: first, their eyes were opened; they recognised Him; and then He was made known to them. Are there not three touches there that would help?
J.T. Quite so; their eyes were opened is a subjective matter; and next they recognised Him, but it was not as a mere apparition of a spirit; it was Himself. There is no evidence they were perturbed, but they immediately set out for Jerusalem, and the Lord comes in as they put the matter into words: how He was made known unto them.
C.A.M. I suppose, in view of the coming of the Lord, there is something in between the fact that we recognise He was a Person here on earth, unique, of course, and a divine Person as a Spirit, and it is that that you would like to understand or be able to recognise?
J.T. That is very good, because the question is whether @Acts 1 means the public appearing of the Lord or whether it means the rapture. The two men in white robes say, "This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall thus come in the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven" (verse 11). Is that a private matter or a public matter? The public matter is from His own words, "For as the lightning goes forth from the east and shines to the west, so shall be the coming of the Son of man", @Matthew 24: 27. That is a very very public thing; and "Behold, he comes with the clouds, and every eye shall see him", @Revelation 1: 7. But the two men in white stress, "In the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven". What does that mean? Is that not the private side of it? There will be no doubt about it when the Lord comes for us; it is no great public matter such as lightning. It is Himself, "this Jesus", and it seems to me that the Lord's supper is what fits into the economy. I am only suggesting these things.
{372}
One would like to know what the brethren think of them; whether @Acts 1 is not the private side, that is the purely personal side, "Shall thus come in the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven". Whose eyes are those? Those of His own. It will be a personal matter. There will be no fear at all, as in such a thought as lightning shining from the east to the west. And it is the Lord Himself. It is a question of how things are done and the manner of His coming. In John He says He comes in among us "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you". And when he comes for the assembly, for us presently, there is no great display of the elements, although the cloud is mentioned, it is personal, the manner of His movements.
A.N.W. We have often referred to the earlier verses in @Acts 1 in connection with presenting Himself alive, but He was then still on earth.
J.T. I think the Lord's supper must be linked on with heaven, in the sense that the Lord gave it to Paul. "For I received from the Lord, that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was delivered up, took bread", @1 Corinthians 11: 23.
"In like manner also the cup" (verse 25). It is a question of manner, and the wording is reduced from what it was in the synoptic gospels. It is brought down to a purely assembly setting, no more. Will Paul not use that word from the Lord to the assembly as such, bringing in this personal side of the Supper and how it keeps us right in the economy until the time that He returns?
C.A.M. And the Lord would use a servant who did not see Him to institute it.
J.T. No, he was not there. We cannot say those two that went to Emmaus were there. It is from the Lord Himself. "For I received from the Lord, that which I also delivered to you", not from Peter and others, but from the Lord.
{373}
W.C. Those two going to Jerusalem, went back with a very different story.
J.T. Yes; it was not the matter of an exposition of the Scriptures, which perhaps was the greatest ever given to any person; they did not allude to that at all. They alluded to this one thing: how He was made known to them.
R.W.S. Are we to be particularly alert as the brother is giving thanks for the loaf and the cup, to look for this spiritual touch?
J.T. I think that is a time calling for the best spiritual attention that we have got. Has anything happened? Yes, something has happened; He was made known unto them in the breaking of bread. But there is a further thought that is not here, and that is the cup of the Lord. "In like manner also the cup". The manner in the breaking of bread is brought in here, but Paul added the cup. That is not found elsewhere. But Paul mentions it in connection with the cup in @1 Corinthians 11 as by itself, and it is reduced from the synoptic gospels; certain words taken away and certain added, as if the Lord was considerate of us. It is Paul's ministry; that is, we have the thing directly from him, as though the Lord were to say, I said something of it before I suffered; and after I rose I spoke to My great servant Paul and he has delivered it to you. That is the position in @1 Corinthians 11, His last word on the subject, His own, indeed, unto the assembly.
T.E.H. As a brother moves towards the table, you support him with what you have spiritually that you may receive a spiritual impression. Sometimes we become disturbed or distracted, but the Lord would help us to attend to that moment and maintain support.
J.T. And then when you discern Him, to be right as to that, and then the next thing: is there anything for Him to partake of? He certainly does not partake of His own Supper. It does not say that He ate anything
{374}
at Emmaus, although He was at table, but now what is there that He can partake of? It is not what has actually accrued in His coming in; it is stock we have got on hand, the fish and the honeycomb; and the fish is broiled; it is whole.
W.N. I would like a little help as regards the bread broken in Emmaus. Are you suggesting the spiritual period begins from that point?
J.T. Yes; and that is brought in by the return of those two.
T.E.H. How do you look upon the two persons coming in?
J.T. It shows how the Lord regards people who have failed, that they may be ready to be used for a new thought. When you are restored, you have a new thought, something for the assembly.
A.D. Those who sinned inadvertently were to add one-fifth part in making restitution.
J.T. Very good; when it reached the priests, they would be enriched by the sin-offering.
T.E.H. Owing to the stressed conditions that were there as the Lord came in, how do you explain their gaining this under such conditions?
J.T. I think the underlying conditions were right. They were sorrowful, and we are told they did not believe for joy when the Lord made Himself known to them. "But while they yet did not believe for joy, and were wondering" (verse 41). I would say this joy being mentioned is to indicate that the conditions were such as the Lord could adjust and make normal immediately. John's account has the same incident so we have to conclude that abstractly they were right. It is not a fixed state. They are amenable to correction immediately.
N.McC. What would you say were the reasons for His partaking of the food? He did not need to take any food to be sustained in that body.
J.T. It undoubtedly was part of the adjusting
{375}
element, but then we cannot limit it to that. We are entitled to consider what is it that the Lord could partake of in a meeting here today in this room? Is there anything? He does not partake of His own supper. What could He partake of? It must be in principle love among ourselves. It is in stock. It is not brought in just there. It is there, this fish is broiled, it is cooked. It is not the immediate outcome of the incoming of the Lord; it is there. It is what we have. "Have ye anything here to eat?". It is what He says elsewhere, "Love amongst yourselves". He can certainly partake of that at any time.
W.C. The fish was not just caught.
J.T. It was cooked fish. John gives us the fish in the last chapter, which is also a matter of recovery. The Lord had the fish on the coals and the bread, too.
W.C. Fish are God's creatures, but bread can be made.
J.T. Fish, I suppose, would be the sovereignty of God, what there is among us from that point of view. Bread would be what we make ourselves. Bread is not mentioned here, but honey. That is a mutual matter.
A.N.W. It says, "And they gave him part of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb" (verse 42).
J.T. That would mean that the Lord gets a part; He shares in what we have got. He does not take it all.
C.A.M. It seems to be a necessity, concrete love amongst one another.
J.T. Yes, what you have. Love ought to be, as it were, a stock of it. John would show that: "If ye have love amongst yourselves". Not each one loving simply, but the thing is among you. That is a necessary condition at all times in the assembly. The Lord can take part in that at any time as He comes in.
R.S. The Lord says to Mary, "Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended"; but here He said,
{376}
"Handle me and see" (verse 39). How do you explain that?
J.T. It is a question of the public assembly. John brings in the heavenly side to teach such as Mary. She supposed that He was the gardener. She would link Him on with what was here; whereas He is bringing in something new. That is, John suggests the wholly spiritual heavenly status; hence He says, "I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God", @John 20: 17. It is to link heron with the heavenly position.
A.A.T. If there is not a happy condition in the meeting we rob the Lord of His portion?
J.T. I think so; there must be a steady stock of love in the assembly. That was His point, "Love amongst yourselves".
T.E.H. Will you help me as to what is in mind as to the public assembly?
J.T. What anybody can see. Anybody can come in on Lord's day and see the Lord's supper partaken of by us.
T.E.H. When Joseph disclosed himself to his brethren the fact was known: "the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard", @Genesis 45: 2.
J.T. Yes; Corinthians contemplates the more formal position, anyone can come in and see what there is.
H.M. It is very humbling when the Lord asked the same question in @John 21, "Have ye anything to eat" (verse 5), they had to say, No.
J.T. They had it here. In @John 21, He does not use the word 'here'; but here He does. It is a question of the assembly, whether there is an assembly stock of food, something the Lord can take part in Himself.
H.M. It shows that unless we are together in love, we are in some other position such as they were, and we would have to say, No.
{377}
J.T. I believe that is the state of things, alas, in all those independent bodies. They have the outward form, but where is the food? Can the Lord take part in it?
R.W.S. The more He takes, the more we have.
W.C. Does this not show wonderful grace on the part of the Lord to do all this work?
J.T. It does. It ought to affect us as to recovery, because the enemy is coming in and there are so many casualties; how are we to meet them? These scriptures are to help us forward as to grace in recovery.
{378}
SALVATION AND SOVEREIGNTY
@2 Corinthians 4: 3, 4; @Luke 19: 1 - 10; @1 Corinthians 1: 21; @2 Timothy 2: 10
These scriptures treat of salvation. It is because people are lost that they need to be saved. There are people lost who will not be saved. There are people lost who will be saved.
Our first scripture contemplates a class of persons that are unsavable. There are, it is said, lost people; and they are lost characteristically. Paul says that if his gospel was veiled, it was in these people. You might as well preach to a cow as try to point out the gospel to these people, who are lost even when the gospel is preached by the greatest preacher, for it would be of no avail. It is not a question of pointing these people out, or listing them, for God alone knows who they are. It is a most solemn matter. "If also our gospel", says the apostle, "is veiled, it is veiled in those that are lost". He goes on to say, "In whom the god of this world has blinded the thoughts of the unbelieving, so that the radiancy of the glad tidings of the glory of the Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine forth for them". Judas was one of these people. Such people know that perdition is their own place. You may urge them to believe, but they will only say, 'We cannot believe, we are lost, we have trifled with the truth of the gospel'. We may assume this is exceptional, but one in that attitude of mind is in great danger. God may say to him, 'You have heard the gospel and been appealed to a great many times, but you have neglected it and have trifled with it', and God may say to such a one, 'The matter is settled as regards you'. God may say that to him, for God knows. It is serious to trifle with God and with the gospel. The Lord is coming with His mighty
{379}
angels, "taking vengeance on those who know not God, and those who do not obey the glad tidings of our Lord Jesus Christ", @2 Thessalonians 1:8. You are leaving out God and Christ. This is not an optional matter. What are your intentions? To carry on as always? God will say one day, 'That is final as far as you are concerned!'.
God may end the matter in that way. He may say, 'This is final with you', for He hates triflers, "Let the filthy make himself filthy still", @Revelation 22: 11. These are the Lord Jesus own words. You have elected to stay as you are. We only say these things because God is so resentful of any who despise the gospel. Furthermore, man or woman, whoever you are, you are exposing yourself to the god of this world, who blinds the eyes of the unbelieving, so that the radiancy of the glad tidings of the Christ should not shine for you. They are shining and Satan cannot stop them shining, but he can stop them for you by blinding your eyes in your neglectful attitude. Another scripture says, "If any be ignorant, let him be ignorant", @1 Corinthians 14: 38. If you will not heed the words of God, you are ignorant, and He will say, 'You can remain in your ignorance'. God will not be mocked. It is a serious matter. Salvation is too great in His mind to be trifled with. He marks the man or woman who does so. If you neglect the gospel, the devil blinds your eyes, and God may say, 'You can just be that!'. You will die that way, and appear before the great white throne as one who neglected the gospel. You will not have a word to say. You cannot over come there! God has the last word, "That thou mayest be justified when thou speakest, be clear when thou judgest", @Psalm 51:4. For when one is called before the great assize, the books condemn him; no word can be said; the matter is finished.
Now we want to turn you to another side of this glorious subject. In @Luke 19 there is a person who is
{380}
lost but is savable. *God can save*. These words are spoken to Zacchaeus, a man in reproach in this world. He used to go with the world, but he has changed his mind. He is not in the class who are lost; a change comes out in him; he is interested in Jesus. I do not know you, for I have not been here before. Perhaps your presence here means that you are interested in Jesus. Jesus says, "To-day salvation is come to this house". Zacchaeus has reached it. May God grant that there are some like that here! You can reach it by receiving the truth of God, and not allowing the devil to blind your eyes. The Lord says, "The Son of man has come to seek and to save that which is lost". Zacchaeus was in that class. The Lord came to seek him, and not only to *seek* him, but to *save* him. He lifted up His eyes and saw Zacchaeus. He is always lifting up His eyes, looking even around this audience, and speaking to one who is likely to get saved. Such ones are of interest to heaven; they are likely persons, like the man at Lystra who was lame from his birth. It is said that he "heard Paul speaking", @Acts 14: 9. It was no accident that he heard Paul speak; he never forgot hearing that speaking! Paul looked upon him "and seeing that he had faith to be healed" (Paul made no mistake!), would see that man was a *savable* man. There is great pleasure in looking into a man's face when he is seeking salvation. In Old Testament times they waited for salvation. Now, those looking for it do not have to wait; it comes about *right here*! So with Zacchaeus we have a man that is savable. He had one desire, he wanted to see Jesus, "who he was". That man was interesting to heaven. He was exceedingly little of stature, but he ran on ahead and got up into a tree. Perhaps you have got up into a tree to see Jesus; you have taken up a superior position. But you will only see Jesus rightly by coming down to Him. We must be on the horizontal, we cannot look down on Jesus. It says
{381}
that Jesus called him by name; it is of interest to heaven to be called by name, "Zacchaeus"; that name was, I believe, music in his ears as he heard Jesus call him by name, "Zacchaeus, make haste and come down". He says to him, "To-day I must remain in thy house". Now think of the interest to heaven. The Lord has something in mind, a man here, a father, with a wife and family. The Lord has them all in mind, as with Paul and Silas in prison, when the jailor comes trembling and cries, "Sirs, what must I do that I may be saved?", @Acts 16: 30. What a question that was! It was not, 'What shall other people do to be saved?'. But it was 'What shall I do?'. You are an interesting man, you are an interesting person, the father of a family. The apostle knew that. The apostle says in his answer, "Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house", @Acts 16: 31. "Thy house" includes the wife and the children. You say, 'I do not believe in that household gospel', but God will secure the family; the family is the thought of God. He has moved in regard of families; so the family is the thought here in @Luke 19, "To-day salvation is come to this house", and Paul would say the same to the jailor.
Paul does not make much of baptism, but he makes a great deal of the *teaching* of baptism. "I thank God that I have baptised none of you ... that no one may say I have baptised unto my own name", @1 Corinthians 1: 14, 15. Paul says, 'I do not want to assume anything of my own'. He may have baptised Crispus and Gaius, and he remembers that he baptised the household of Stephanas, a household well worth baptising! But in the chapter in Acts Paul says, "Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house". If the man were saved by himself, he would never reach the full thought of God, that God would save his house. "And he took them the same hour of the night and washed them from their stripes". What
{382}
a changed man he is! He is a saved man, and as *head* of his house also, for you cannot dissociate the man and his house. He "was baptised, he and all his straightway", and there was great joy in that house. So the Lord says to Zacchaeus here, 'I am coming to abide in your house today'. A fine thing that! This man says, 'I want to see who He is, and to hear what He says'. He comes down. How agile he is! He has joy in his heart. Why? Because the Lord Jesus is coming to his house. Let us not neglect the thought of households! God is saving households continually through the gospel. It is said that he received the Lord gladly. He had had many a friend up to now, but a Person like this had never been in his house before!
The Lord says, "the Son of man has come to seek and to save that which is lost". Here is a lost person. The Lord did not have to go to Jericho to find this man. Zacchaeus is looking for Jesus. Jesus did not have to go far to find him. Sometimes the Lord seeks and cannot find the sheep. In @Luke 15 the Lord leaves the ninety and nine and goes after the lost sheep, "until he find it". There is no question there; *it is found*. The sheep there is a findable person. In @Matthew 18 it is, "If ... he find it"; that is to say, if the Lord came to Winnipeg to find a man, He *might* find him in a theatre. That is not a very likely place to be found in, for he is unlikely to hear anything about salvation there. So Matthew says, "If ... he find it", but in Luke the Lord finds His lost sheep. If you are here tonight the Lord does not have very far to go to find you. You are right in His way. Zacchaeus was in His way, and the Lord found him. He was a savable person. "The Son of man has come to seek and to save that which is lost". I leave the word with you. Zacchaeus "made haste and came down, and received him with joy". That is Luke's line. The Lord was not content to have Zacchaeus
{383}
simply look at Him, but He would abide at his house. At that moment the devil, Satan, comes in; they say, "He has turned in to lodge with a sinful man" (verse 7). But Zacchaeus does not deny that; he offers an excuse: "If I have taken anything from any man by false accusation, I return him fourfold". That is more than one hundred cents to the dollar! But the Lord brings in that which puts him in his right mind, a changed view. Zacchaeus does not deny the sin, but Christ is the Saviour, the Saviour who died for sinners. "Faithful is the word, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners",
@1 Timothy 1: 15. He died for them. "Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures; and that he was buried; and that he was raised the third day, according to the scriptures", @1 Corinthians 15: 3, 4. "Therefore having been justified on the principle of faith, we have peace towards God through our Lord Jesus Christ",
@Romans 5: 1. Now this man did not deny he was a sinner, but told the Lord he returned fourfold. The Lord does not discredit that, but pointed out that he was a *savable person*, "a son of Abraham". "To-day salvation is come to this house", He says. As I was saying before, salvation is for the household. Satan would destroy households, discredit headship, and encourage disobedience, but he is to have no further place in *this* household, for the Lord has brought salvation: "To-day salvation is come to this house, inasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham; for the Son of man has come to seek and to save that which is lost". He was lost and is found, and he is saved. "Who has saved us ... not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the ages of time", @2 Timothy 1: 9.
Now I come to the third scripture, "For since, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom has not known God, God has been pleased by the foolishness
{384}
of the preaching to save those that believe", @1 Corinthians 1: 21. It does not say, 'to save them that are *lost*'; I have already spoken of that. But if I am lost and *savable*, I must believe. Here He is pleased to save *those who believe* by the foolishness of the preaching. The apostle is dealing with worldly wisdom; by it none know God. But by the foolishness of the preaching God is saving a certain class, "those that believe".
You are lost, and you judge yourself like Zacchaeus; the Lord comes seeking you, and if you believe you are saved. Paul says to Agrippa, "Believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest", @Acts 26: 27. Paul gave him credit for believing the Scriptures, but, alas, that was as far as he went, for he says, "In a little thou persuadest me to become a Christian". Poor, poor king! He knew the Scriptures, yet he was lost. You know in your heart tonight where you are. The Lord challenges you as to your faith; *can you believe*? By the foolishness of the preaching God is saving a certain class; the people who are saved, *they* believe. Are you lost or saved? I challenge you tonight! Look into your heart. Do you believe God?
Do you believe the Scriptures? Do you believe the gospel? Can you face that, and *go the whole way*? This is the line upon which to commence being a christian, to *believe an the gospel*. It is the only ground on which anyone can stand. And so the apostle says that "by the foolishness of the preaching" God is saving them that believe. You may never hear the gospel again. This is your opportunity. Believe the gospel, believe God, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ! God is saving a certain class of people, not simply those that are lost, but *those who believe*. That is all I had on that point.
Now to come to the fourth scripture, "For this cause I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that *they* also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ
{385}
Jesus with eternal glory". The greatness of suffering is seen in Paul; we are so far behind him in preaching, in which, as he says, he endured "all things for the sake of the elect, that *they* also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus". It was that point that was before me, "the elect". The apostle suffered all for them, that every man classified as such should be saved. The Lord Jesus, we are told in @Acts 2, "added to the assembly daily those that were to be saved". The apostle had the elect in mind when agonising in the preaching. He is going to tell us something of the magnitude of salvation and, incidentally, of the greatness of believers who get it, "the elect".
In @Acts 13 Paul and Barnabas appear to win the whole town. The whole town turned out to hear the gospel; you say, it is a great ingathering of souls; but there were not so many as you may think. We have to apply the principle of selection. "Many are called ones, but few chosen ones" (@Matthew 22: 14), as the end of that chapter shows, for the Jews stirred up a disturbance against Paul and Barnabas, and it is said in verse 48 that "as many as were ordained to eternal life" believed. They were those foreknown of God before the foundation of the world, those whose names were written in heaven. These are the people Paul is agonising about in this chapter: "I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that *they* also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory".
Paul endures all that *we* may obtain that. It is wonderful, God's salvation in Christ Jesus! It is magnificent that I may come to Christ and obtain all that. The preacher is suffering that the class of people, called 'the elect of God', might not lose this, but that we might know our calling, the salvation in Christ Jesus, and the expanse of it, 'eternal glory'. God drew us from this world through the gospel that we might obtain the salvation in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
{386}
The Lord says to us that we must go in for the salvation that is to be obtained, and obtained with eternal glory. You cannot afford to miss these things and not to be a real christian; it is the eternal purpose of God. May the Lord bless His word!
{387}
DIVINE TOUCHES
@Luke 5: 12, 13; @1 Kings 19: 3 - 8; @Revelation 1: 17 - 20
These scriptures speak of divine touches. They are mentioned many other times elsewhere but I have selected these as bearing upon those who serve in the things of God. Of course, we are all to serve. We find very young people serving in Scripture, the most exceptional is the maid employed in the house of Naaman the Syrian. She served his wife in material things but she served him, a great man, in spiritual things. She served with feeling and effectively. The service culminated in his cure from his leprosy. Let every young one here think of that: how much she or he might do as laying himself out to serve. I have in mind persons who, like the apostle Paul, could say, "Ourselves your bondmen for Jesus sake", @2 Corinthians 4: 5. Such a one had been divinely touched; a touch of Christ passing on himself, as it were, in a characteristic sense in the service; so that the service or services are to take on character from Christ. Luke would have this in mind.
So I have Peter in view in reading these two verses. It is Peter's chapter, this chapter 5. The crisis had passed; he was converted. Luke treats of Peter peculiarly. He is not called Peter in this gospel until this chapter; he is called Simon. He is not called Peter until he makes his confession. Everyone has to make his confession; and that is not the confession of faith that is written for everybody. Each has his own to make. David wrote his; he wrote it poetically, too; it was his confession. He had first-aid in his confession. The one who convicted him stood by him; he was not left to himself to make his first confession. Nathan stood by him; he needed support. And so Nathan says, "Thou art the man!".
{388}
He had recourse to a parable to reach that man's conscience, the king's conscience, and he selected a good method. It succeeded admirably, so that he finishes up, "Thou art the man!", @2 Samuel 12: 7. David says, "I have sinned against Jehovah"; he is smitten in his conscience. He had sinned against others too, but he kept to that thought. Later he says, "Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done what is evil in thy sight", @Psalm 51: 4. He had sinned against Urijah the Hittite and others, but he is quick in his acknowledgment: "I have sinned against Jehovah". He did not write the psalm then; he weighed it over as the sin became enlarged in his mind. It is not to be hidden, not to be forgotten, not to be concealed under a pious exterior; it is written down for the coming generations; we might say, for a thousand generations. It was his confession. Nathan stood by him at the first confession. He rendered what we may call first-aid to a man that needed it, for conviction of sin is terrible unless there is remission of sin. Thank God there is remission! And the one who convicted him announced remission. "Jehovah has also put away thy sin: thou shalt not die" (verse 13). He deserved to die, and he knew it. What a volume of grace entered into Nathan's heart! God put it there, so that he could speak aright to the convicted sinner. "Jehovah has also put away thy sin: thou shalt not die".
It was so with Peter. This is not his great sin; that comes in later in this gospel. This is one that he confesses, or the state he confesses. I am connecting my remarks with him for the moment, because the chapter is really, as you might say, Peter's. He, like David, is outstanding as a servant, "First, Simon, who was called Peter"; but Luke reserves his name "Peter" until he confesses. I shall not get my spiritual designation until I confess my sin; I mean, until I make my confession. You may say that I am
{389}
preaching the gospel. No, I am not; I am preaching to saints. But, of course, it is the gospel; but it is instruction, I hope, for saints. This is a question of my confession. This is Peter's chapter in that sense. The Lord had been to his house and healed his mother-in-law, but He does not call him Peter. It is as he falls down at Jesus knees. It was not merely the effect of gravity, the weight of his body; it was an act of his own to fall, to prostrate himself, as it were, at the knees of the Saviour. No safer place for a sinner! Oh, you say, you are using the word 'sinner'! It is well, dear brethren, to retain that word as one of the names attaching to each of us. Retain it! There is moral glory attached to it as retained by a forgiven sinner; and a forgiven sinner is a lover of Jesus. There is a moral glory attached to the word 'sinner' as he retains it as applied to him. How can I use the word 'Saviour' unless I retain the word 'sinner' or 'lost one'? So the greatest saint, I suppose (I venture to say the greatest saint) says he was the chief of sinners, many years after he became the greatest saint. That was Paul. Another man called Simon retained his name, too. It is an added name, a hyphenated one, if you wish to call it that, Simon the leper; there is moral glory attached to that, and he would not give it up; I am sure he did not. The more the sense of forgiveness, the more the sense of the righteousness of God, the more power I have in retaining what I have been. It is to exalt Christ that He has saved me in spite of that. "Simon the leper" was not a leper when the Lord Jesus was anointed in his house. There was no contamination with him then; still, he was "Simon the leper". The Lord, the Saviour, who was about to die for him, sat by his side. How Simon would look at Jesus on that memorable night or day, when some woman came in and anointed the head of the Lord Jesus, anointed His *head*. I suppose no one in that house,
{390}
other than Christ and the woman, valued that action in the house of Simon the leper.
The matter of leprosy comes into this chapter, and Peter had already indicated that he was a leper. The Lord had been in his house; he was another Simon, but he was not called 'Simon the leper'. He had seen his mother-in-law healed of her fever, and he had seen her serving, too. She served him, too, as well as the Lord: "She served them", it says. But he is not yet called anything but Simon; but when he makes his confession according to this chapter, he is Simon Peter. He has got his spiritual name. Each of us has that, you know. It is well to get it, because it belongs to you; it is your honour. Some great personages have a lot of names; you wonder how they remember them. Well, there is room for names that carry moral glories, the leper, the sinner, but a spiritual name is that which abides in eternity. Simon will not be called the leper in heaven; I am certain of that. Peter will be the name by which the apostle will be known there. The Lord says in John, "Thou art Simon, the son of Jonas; thou shalt be called Cephas (which interpreted is stone)", @John 1: 42.
That will be his name. So he is called Simon Peter here. He has a name that is to abide, and I have no doubt that Peter coming into the chapter runs through, and this remarkable identification by Christ with this leper would imply what Peter was to Him. He stretched out His hand and touched the leper. The word 'touch' is not simply that; it is a handling of the person. Who could do it but Jesus! He is going to take on all that, you know, and to relieve His servant of it as in Peter's case, so that his conscience should not smite him in his service. How serious it is if one's conscience smites one as he seeks to serve the Lord! It cripples him. One must remember the touch of the hand of Christ; that is, His complete identification with the leper; it is complete. It is
{391}
not a mere touch; it is a full handling. The Lord is securing him; identifying Himself with him; but He is securing him. This will never be forgotten. If I had sin trouble and were near Peter, I would go to Peter. I do not know of any man I would go to quicker than Peter; or any of those men, Paul or David, who were handled in this way by the Saviour's going and taking on all their leprosy. He is going to bear the full weight of it in death; but He never loses sight of the leper. As the apostle Paul says, "In that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me", @Galatians 2: 20. He knew the Lord had him in His heart when He died. "Who has loved me"; he does not say, 'who loves me'; of course He loved Paul right along, but "who has loved me", that is, when He died, He loved him, "and given himself for me". Think of what Paul was in the Lord's heart, dear brethren. The whole vision was in the Lord's mind of these great men that He would use. He laid hold of the leper; He handled him. "I will; be thou cleansed: and immediately the leprosy departed from him". He would have them in His mind. "Who has loved me", says the apostle in the past tense, and in loving me He gave Himself for me. What a power that was in the soul of the greatest of sinners, that the Saviour loved him when He died for him, gave Himself for him.
Well now, I have spoken of David and Paul and Peter, and of course I am not speaking for them. It is for those of us who are here. The Lord is using a good many of us, thank God; He needs more, but we are to be used as going through these experiences, coming under His touch. Think of the sense of the touch of the Saviour in dealing with our state-it is state here. Peter says, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord", @Luke 5: 8. That is leprosy; the Lord dealt with it.
{392}
Well now, I have spoken of these great servants, and the next one I want to speak about is Elijah, one of the greatest of the Old Testament saints. It was he, you know, who came out with Moses on the mount and spoke with Jesus. What did they speak with Jesus about on the mount? Some of us may not have noticed much, some of us have. They were speaking with Jesus. You say perhaps, It ought to be Jesus speaking to them. No. The speaking on the mount was to bring out the greatness of the heavenly saints; the greatness of Jesus, of course, transcending all; for He alone was transfigured, but these two men appeared in glory. It was a robe of glory in which they appeared; they appeared in glory speaking with Him. And Luke tells us they were speaking about His death. How beautiful that is! How the Lord loved to hear them, and how He loves to listen to us at His Supper as we sit there and speak to Him about His death; it was that which should be accomplished at Jerusalem. I think the word is 'exodus', that is, His outgoing. But think of the way He did it: that He should go out at Jerusalem, "the great city, which is called spiritually Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified" (@Revelation 11: 8), and Moses and Elijah were speaking about that; they had come out of heaven. I suppose they had seen wonderful things up there; I know we shall see wonderful things and persons. But they are not speaking to the Lord on the mount about what was in heaven, but what He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. Elijah was one of them, so he is greatly honoured, and worthy of the honour conferred upon him, too. One would have liked to hear what Moses said to the Lord at that time! We are not told in detail what they said; we are told of the subject they were engaged with; but you would have loved to hear Moses say to the Lord something about His death. You know how much he was engaged in the types with the death of Jesus. What
{393}
a conversation it must have been! How the Lord would listen! He is a Listener; a Speaker, of course; His name is "The Word", "The Word of God"; referring to His speaking, it says, "Never man spoke thus, as this man speaks", @John 7: 46. But He could listen too. I would urge upon all never to fail to speak to Him; He is always ready to listen sympathetically. They were speaking, not about themselves, but about His decease, or His exit, which He should accomplish at Jerusalem.
Now Elijah was there and so he is in the great company of servants, the leading servants of God. But he is fleeing now from a woman. I do not need to go into the details; he is fleeing from Jezebel. She sent a message to him that gave him just one day to live. Think of the hard, imperious character of that woman! I suppose she is the worst woman mentioned in Scripture; she is carried down to New Testament times in the book of Revelation, Jezebel. She teaches; she is a teacher; but she sends a message to the great servant of God and says, "So do the gods to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to-morrow about this time!", @1 Kings 19: 2. I will give you twenty-four hours and you will be like one of the prophets of Baal. How sure she is! Sometimes you hear persons in the world speak with such assurance. Very often their assurances are lies and they know it; but she meant it. She had assurance that she could take that man's life in twenty-four hours. You know how she got Naboth's life. It is similar. She knew how to do it; she was trained in wickedness, educated in wickedness.
Well, Elijah fled for his fife. You could understand how he came under the power of the thing for the moment, and yet he had stood up against eight hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and of the groves, and Ahab with them; but here is one woman and he flees, flees from her. Well, the facts are all known to you, I
{394}
suppose; but I want to call attention to a statement here that he went down to Beer-sheba; and in saying this, the Spirit of God says that city belonged to Judah. What was the point in staying there? Well, think of what a man like Elijah would contemplate when he came to Beer-sheba. Beer-sheba? Why, he ought to have said, if he did not, My father Abraham was in this place; he planted a grove in this place. He entered into covenant with Abimelech in this place. He gave Abimelech seven ewe lambs to indicate the spirit he was in. And he worshipped Jehovah; he called on Jehovah, the eternal God, in this place. Undoubtedly Elijah knew that. Why, beloved, it ought to have turned him back, the very thought of Beer-sheba! Think of Judah! Who was Judah? He refers to the counsels of God in the tribes; the sovereign action of God; he who prevailed above his brethren; he from whom came the ruler who had come and gone, David. But it is the Messiah; he should be reminded of the Messiah who would do everything and tell everything. The very name Beer-sheba, the well of the oath, ought to have diverted him from his journey and directed him back whence he came, to Ahab and Jezebel. Could the eternal God not stand by him? Certainly! What a word it is! He left his servant there and went off into the wilderness. It seems to me he must have felt uncomfortable, a man out of the way. For that is the truth; there he was on the wrong way. He must have felt uncomfortable in the surroundings of the city of Beer-sheba. Everything spoke of God. God appeared to Jacob in this very city. Why should he not think of these things? I suppose he did. He must have been uncomfortable. He went out into the wilderness and lay down under a juniper bush and went to sleep. What a picture of a great servant! What a sorrowful picture! What must heaven have thought of it!
{395}
Well, heaven was thinking of him and watching him on every step of his journey, and one of the emissaries of God, an angel, came there. What a God we have to serve! As someone has said, If I turn away from God, what will He do? He will shine on my back!
He was shining on Elijah's back, you might say. His back was on the land of promise; his face was toward Horeb. What for? To resign his commission! Think of the sorrowfulness of it! Giving up such an honourable service; the service of such a God; service in which he had been so signally honoured. Going to resign!
Well, God says, Elijah, I feel for you; you are going a long way, and you know the wilderness of Sinai, a perfect wilderness. It is a terrible wilderness; it is called a great and terrible wilderness. You wonder how he survived at all traversing that wilder ness. It is a wilderness of death but God took account of His servant in his unfaithfulness. Let us be encouraged in entering on the service of God, that it is such a God. Not that He gives licence for failure like this; not that He would encourage it at all. He would rebuke it as He did in this case; but nevertheless, the servant is His servant to Him; Elijah is still Elijah; the Elijah that would come out presently on the mount of transfiguration; He wanted him to do it. And so an angel touches him as he sleeps. It is a divine touch, I may say, because the angel is representative of God. "An angel touched him, and said to him, Arise, eat!" (verse 5). As we had lately, "Wake up, thou that sleepest, and arise up from among the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee",
@Ephesians 5: 14. The Christ was shining upon him; grace was there. In failure we need food. It is doubtful whether anybody ever will repent in failure unless you feed him. A cake was at his head, baked on hot coals. Think of heaven's cakes! How wonderful it is that heaven comes down just to where we are,
{396}
like the manna, bread from heaven. Man did eat angels food, the food of the mighty. But this is not manna. This is a cake baked on coals, and a cruse of water. This is nothing new to Elijah; bread and water were familiar enough to him. He waited in the house of the widow of Sarepta when things were scarce, but the cruse of oil did not run out, nor the barrel of meal. How he would be reminded that the very God that kept that widow and her son and him for a year was now baking cakes for him. How God would come into our vision to stir us up and comfort us, so that we might be true servants and not run away when we are attacked by a woman or anybody else, but stand our ground. "Be strong and very courageous". And now God is reminding him of his prior history. The very God that kept him-he himself said to the woman of Sarepta, "Make me thereof a little cake first", the very word 'cake'. Now the angel was making a cake for him; God was doing it, you might say, and there was a cruse of water; all would remind him of what a God he had to do with. Let us know God! "Let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me", @Jeremiah 9: 24. You are pulled up at once as something comes to your mind that reminds you of God; and that is the point here. It is a question of cakes entering in so distinctly into Elijah's history. And he takes the cake and the water and goes to sleep again. It is a remarkable history. You say, The sleep was good for him. Of course it was, but God is waiting on him until he gets another sleep. How comforting it is! You go to bed and God waits on you, and the next night the same thing. Maybe the next day you need a sleep.
God looks after you in sleep as in wakefulness. And the second time He came and touched him. What is all this about? Will he ever forget those touches? Never! Two divine touches, and two divine meals. The angel says, "Arise, eat; for the journey is too
{397}
great for thee". There is another meal, and he eats again (verse 7). What sympathy in heaven for us! Are we seeking to serve the Lord? Let no one shrink from it. If God opens up a line of service, do not shrink from it. Such a God is your God. There is divine food, so that the way is traversed. God would have him to go the whole length of that road, and as he ended the journey, God says, "What doest thou here, Elijah?". His answer is a complaint against the people of God. God does not like that. As soon as a servant begins to speak against the people of God in a characteristic way he has lost his commission. You cannot serve people unless you respect them; you cannot love them unless you respect them. And Elijah was speaking against the people of God. He thought there was not a single man but himself that was faithful to God, whereas Paul says, "But what says the divine answer to him?". Listen to that answer. "I have left to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed knee to Baal", @Romans 11: 4. That is what God said; God had reserved them to Himself; but Elijah is speaking against them. How sorrowful all this is! How ready we are to speak against the people of God, and maybe the most honoured of them. "But what says the divine answer to him?". That is how Paul puts it; he himself knew what it was to be spoken against. Think of that man at Corinth where he had worked so faithfully. They said of him, "His presence in the body weak, and his speech naught", @2 Corinthians 10: 10. "But what says the divine answer to him? I have left to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed knee to Baal". At the end of the journey that question comes up and Elijah tells the old story; and there was an earthquake and a fire; God was not in either. But all these are symbolic of divine power, what God could do with Jezebel. How quickly He could have withered her up with any of these powers, and yet
{398}
Elijah fled from her. But God was not in any of them. God could use one of those at a distance; God does not need to be in them, but He operates through them. And now Elijah comes out and hears a still small voice. God takes up Elijah and uses him again, sending him to anoint Elisha and others, meaning that God will get His purpose. If I do not do the work He has given me to do, someone else will; but if I love God I will do what I can. That is the idea, and Elijah was used again. God in grace restored him. Now just a word about John in Revelation; he, too, is a great servant. I just wanted to show how the touch is to affect us in our actual service. The Lord says to John in verse 18, "I am living to the ages of ages, and have the keys of death and of hades". And in verse 17 it says, "He laid his right hand upon me",
His right hand. That is, I come now to the last word; it is a question of your very best. The Lord is saying this to you in touching you with His right hand; it does not say His right hand touched the leper or that the angel's right hand touched Elijah; but John is in full service. He is in the Spirit on the Lord's day, in prison for the testimony. There is no rebuke for John. The Lord puts His right hand upon him; He means to give him to realise that his very best is to be put into the service. The Lord is saying, I have put *My* very best into the service. The right hand is symbolic of one's best in service; and the Lord is saying to us tonight, Whatever little bit you undertake to do, do it with your might. "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might". It is not an optional matter. "Cursed be he that doeth the work of Jehovah negligently", @Jeremiah 48: 10. That is a most solemn word. People think they can make the Lord's work a mere side-line, but the Lord does not like that. He wants you to put your whole strength into the thing. As John says, "That we may not lose what we have wrought, but may receive full wages",
{399}
(2 @John 8); you want to get all the wages. Love will tell you what wages to expect. It is no selfish matter at all. The Lord puts His right hand upon him and tells him, "I am living to the ages of ages, and have the keys of death and of hades". What a mighty Person is speaking! All powerful! And He is saying, I put all *My* strength into the service that God committed to Me, and I want you to take it on. John was working faithfully; Now, the Lord says, there are three things you have got to attend to. There are three things, one, two, three, that you are to write about. I just wanted to say that we must learn to be in order in our service. It is very important, I believe, in service, especially if you are speaking to the saints, if you have your number one, two, three; because we are built that way. Our minds are created that way to take in mathematics, so to speak; to take in the order of one, two, three. It is to keep things in their order; it is a question of order. So the Lord is saying to us tonight, If you are going to speak or write for the saints or to the saints, see to it that things are in order; that you are understood. There is the intelligence and the intelligible; that is, what I have got and what I can convey. God has done that perfectly. The word 'Logos' ('The Word') means that; it means the divine mind has come out in intelligence and intelligibility. There is intelligence, and there is intelligibility. God has made us that way. He has given us fingers and eyes and toes and hands-all on the principle of number. He is the God of measure; He is called that. Take Luke, for instance; Luke says, "It has seemed good to me also ... to write to thee with method" (@Luke 1: 3); and there is no book in the Scriptures so easily understood as Luke. He writes with method. And so the Lord has put His right hand upon John and told him about Himself, and He says, "Write therefore what thou hast seen" (verse 19). That is number one. He says, in effect, If you are going to write a book,
{400}
the first thing is what you see. He saw the Lord and the candlesticks and all this. The next thing you are to write is number two: "The things that are" what you have seen is preliminary. These things that are have continued on from the time the Lord spoke until I am speaking now, and they will go on still further. The little word 'are' is present tense, but it is now some seventeen or eighteen centuries old. That is a wonderful thing. John, you are to write that; that is number two, covering such a period of time. It is in the divine touch you can do this. He put His right hand upon him; this is the way; put your all into it. This book is called a sealed book by many, but it is not a sealed book, it is an opened book; that is, to those who have the Spirit of God it is very intelligible, but the Lord knew the difficulties that would attach to it, and He told John in effect, to write it very carefully in order and in all the strength that I am imparting to you. That is number two. And number three is "The things that are about to be after these". The connection is in the word 'and'. "Write therefore what thou hast seen, and the things that are, and the things that are about to be after these" (verse 19). There are three sets. So He has put it on John to write this book. There is no such care, as far as I know, expended on any other book as this. A great servant is taken up and treated in this way. He is the servant that Jesus loved; the most interesting, perhaps, of all the servants of God. He is the only one that is called the disciple whom Jesus loved; several times over he is called that. And the Lord has never forgotten that; He loves him just now as much as ever He did, when He was telling him this thing.
To be very simple, "the things that are" refer to the history of the assembly, the seven churches. "The things that are about to be after these" are what we find in the book from chapter 4 until the end. "The things that are about to be after these" will
{401}
take up a great deal more space than the first two. The book is mainly "the things that are about to be after these". That is a great practical outline of the history of Europe and the world that is seen in this book from chapter 4 until the end. I am now speaking about order in our service, that we present the truth in intelligence and intelligibility, so that those who hear may run, as it is said, "Write the vision, and engrave it upon tablets, that he may run that readeth it" (@Habakkuk 2: 2), and that he that hears may know what it means and may "accept with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls", @James 1: 21.
{402}
COMPLETENESS IN THE THINGS OF GOD
@Acts 3: 16; @Revelation 7: 13 - 17
It is in mind to stress the idea of completeness in the things of God. There has been completeness from the divine side which we all accept, but what is to be stressed is completeness from our side. The idea of the thing is that we are to go the whole way. The idea of finish marks God's way and works. Also if we trace the way the Lord went to secure us, as indicated in the gospels, there was finish and completeness. The thought becomes wider and greater as we trace the work of our Lord Jesus Christ; the work of redemption was complete. That is a point that should always be stressed in the gospel. "I have completed the work", He says.
The apostle Paul speaks of the glad tidings which he had announced to the Corinthians and he says, "which also ye received". He says, "That Christ died for our sins, ... and that he was buried". All this detail is brought in as we view the vicarious work of Christ. "That he was buried; and that he was raised the third day, according to the scriptures",
@1 Corinthians 15: 3, 4. Was that as far as Paul ever went?
It was so far complete. But the exaltation of Christ must be added to that. Then it goes on to say, "He appeared to Cephas". He is now bringing a witness to the fact of His resurrection. And then He appeared to the twelve; then to five hundred brethren at one time. That would be five hundred and twelve if we like to put it that way! Five hundred and twelve witnesses to the resurrection of Christ!
The resurrection of Christ does not take in the fulness of the gospel, but it certainly goes a long way. Scripture is extremely accurate as to what is the end of the gospel. Then the apostle Paul says, "Then
{403}
he appeared to James". One brother, a reliable man! He was reliable in the service of God, a person you could trust. Vacillation in the things of God is despicable. Christianity requires men that stand by the truth. Well, Paul says, "He appeared to James; then to all the apostles; and last of all, as to an abortion",-one born out of due time-"he appeared to *me* also". The man who was less than the least of all saints says, "He appeared to *me*", the one who was not meet to be called an apostle because he persecuted the assembly. "But by God's grace", Paul says, "I am what I am". It is a great matter to understand, in the service of God, administrative service, a man is what he is. You want to understand that you are what you are by the grace of God. A real christian is what he is by the grace of God, and it is required that we recognise a man according to what he is. Paul went to the third heaven, but he says, "By God's grace I am what I am". All this still only brings us to resurrection, to a risen Man witnessed to by all these persons. The Lord saw to that.
Then Peter in that address in the beginning of Acts makes clear the point that not only is Christ raised from the dead-He is that-but to quote His own words prophetically from @Psalm 16, "Thou wilt not leave my soul in hades". Think of the Lord of glory saying that! "Not leave my soul in hades, nor wilt thou give thy gracious one to see corruption". That is what the Lord Jesus says Himself. Then Peter goes on to say that, besides His resurrection, "God has made him, this Jesus whom *ye* have crucified, both Lord and Christ". That is the top stone, the exaltation of Christ!
The gospel has all that in mind, for a risen, exalted, glorified Christ is presented in the gospel. Peter says, "Having therefore been exalted by the right hand of God, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which *ye*
{404}
behold and hear". What was that? Certain persons had been in the upper room in Jerusalem and the Holy Spirit had come upon them. How did He come? He came in a violent impetuous blowing, not as He came on Jesus. In the house they heard a sound as of hard breathing, and it filled all the house. They heard the sound of it, and the sound filled the house. What God sent filled the house where they were sitting. It is a wonderful thing to hear the sound of the gospel until it fills you. It is part of the gospel to give you to know that the Holy Spirit is available to you. It is part of the gospel, as Peter says to these people, "this which ye behold and hear". What did they see and hear? They were a critical people in Jerusalem that day; there were mockers in Jerusalem that day. As they heard the saints talk of the things of God they found them to be different to what they used to be.
Well, these mockers say they are full of new wine. Peter begins there. How wonderful it is that God comes to where we are! Peter knew something about wine; he says people do not get drunk in the morning. He condescends to use that thing and the first gospel address, perhaps the greatest, began with a reference to wine. The simplicity of Peter; he knew when people drank wine! God comes down to the ignorant attitude of ungodly people. He meets you on your own ground. He unfolds the greatest things from the commonplace reference to the time of the day when people drink wine. He refers to the greatest thing, that Jesus is at the right hand of God, "Having therefore been exalted by the right hand of God". Note the word 'exalted'. He showed that it was not wine, but the Spirit of God. That is the great object of all this. Christ has died and been buried and is now raised and exalted. The whole matter is settled. The great plan of the gospel is a finished matter. It is not only sanctification, great as that is, or justification,
{405}
but the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, from a risen glorified Christ. It is a finished matter. Anyone who stops short of that finish has stopped short in christianity. There are many like that. The apostle Paul met certain at Ephesus who were like that. He says to them, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?"; @Acts 19: a. You say, 'I do not believe it is right to preach the gospel like that'. These were men who had received something in the way of light. While thousands receive something in the way of light, not many go the way the gospel indicates. Really they are only half finished, if they have never gone on to the Spirit.
So Paul says, "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?". They say, 'We have not even heard of Him'. How many there are like that. Maybe you hide behind ignorance, and make ignorance a virtue. You ought to be ashamed of yourself if you have never heard of the Holy Spirit. Ignorance is no excuse. They had never heard of Him, but there was one thing in their favour, they wanted the truth. They had been baptised to John's baptism. It has often been said that John was a great baptist. There is a church called the Baptist church now, but it is nothing beside John's church. His disciples were real believers. So real that when they heard of Jesus they left John and followed Him. The Lord turns and sees them following. As the Lord turns and looks into this room, how many can He see here who receive the gospel like this? The Lord looks around to see you. You have come here tonight; the Lord is glad to see you. He looks into your heart, and what are your motives? There were two following; the name of the one was Andrew, the other was most likely the writer of the gospel. I am not saying it was the writer of the gospel, mind you, but it is very likely. So the disciples of John followed Jesus, and He looked around and saw them following. He is pleased to see you
{406}
here tonight. You could have been at home, reading a novel. Many people do that on a Sunday night; many do worse than that. He says to them, "What seek ye?". What have you come for? They answer Him, "Rabbi", that is, they called Him Lord. The scripture says that they called Him by that name, which being interpreted means 'Teacher'. When Judas calls Him 'Rabbi', the Holy Spirit makes no comment, but when learners call Him 'Rabbi' then the Holy Spirit says, It means 'Teacher'. These men are seeking the whole truth. They would be where Jesus is, and so they say, "Where abidest thou?" and He says, "Come and see". Beautiful words! You have come to the meeting tonight, is it to find out where the Lord abides? Then it says, "They abode with him that day". All this brings out that there is no limit to the things of God, if you will go the whole way. Some people are always talking about the millennium, about the wonderful times they will have then. What is your outlook as a christian? What is the finish? Oh, you say, We are going to be with the Lord. No, that is not the finish. The finish is to be conformed to the image of God's Son. We are going to be His companions, His companions for ever and ever, He being the first-born among many brethren. Is not that a wonderful finish! Do I want to stop short of that? There is the gospel of heaven as well as the gospel of creation, and then also there is the gospel of the land.
Well, now I want to show you how this is worked out in Acts. The great power of the gospel is in the completing of the matter. Peter says in verse 16, "By faith in his name, his name has made this man strong whom ye behold and know; and the faith which is by him has given him this complete sound ness in the presence of you all". Now I want you to note these words, *complete soundness* in the presence of you all. I suppose God selected this man at the gate
{407}
of the temple, because he was a well-known man. There was a man in our neighbourhood, who was wheeled about and he was a well-known person.
Only the fact that he was wheeled about distinguished him from others. This man in @Acts 3 sat at the gate of the temple, and God selected him for this complete soundness, because everyone knew him. They all knew him as unsound. He was lame, and he was laid there regularly. People who went into the temple saw him. Heaven saw that man there many a day. Heaven was waiting an opportunity to exhibit that man in Jerusalem, as a great, heavenly example of the completeness of the gospel. Complete soundness!
God has gone all the way. The very best is for you in Christ. Will you go all the way?
You could say to this man, Now you were very lame. It does not say that he had ever walked. It says, they carried him to the gate of the temple, and laid him there to beg. You might say, to him, Well, I'm glad that you are better, but have you any after-pains? Wonderful operations are performed today but there are always these after-pains. This man says there were none at all. There is not a bone in my foot or my leg that has not been affected. Not one!
I want to try to bring out the finish of this matter. It is a matter of faith. It is faith in that Name, which has affected that person in such an extraordinary manner. This matter of faith, I would like all here to grasp. Have you any? The person who has it is regarded as very highly privileged. The Lord says to the woman, "Thy faith". Not simply 'faith' but "Thy faith". Now to this man Peter says, "Look on us". He does not say that in the second chapter to those mockers. God looks on mockers. If you are a mocker God looks with scorn on you. Peter began with mockers, but to this man he says, 'Look on John and me'.
Now take up this matter of faith. Peter says it is
{408}
faith in His name. It is this Person, the name of Jesus of Nazareth. It is a question of the name, we want to take in this word 'name'. I hope every one here will get into his soul the need of faith. "By faith in his name, his name has made this man strong whom ye behold and know; and the faith which is by him has given him this complete soundness in the presence of you all". It would take too much time for me to work out this phraseology. It is faith in His name-get that into your souls! "Salvation is in none other, for neither is there another name under heaven", says Peter elsewhere, "... by which we must be saved". At the name of Jesus every tongue shall confess, and every knee shall bow to the glory of God the Father. Then, it is through faith in His name. Jesus is "the leader and completer of faith", @Hebrews 12: 2. Peter says, It is through the name of Jesus. Peter had faith. I am labouring in my soul at this moment to impart to you something of this, that you may get into your soul faith in that name. Peter said to the man, "In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazaraean, rise up and walk". Well, did he rise up and walk? No, Peter gave him his right hand. Faith was in Peter, and Peter carried it to this man.
It says in @Romans 10: "Faith then is by a report, but the report by God's word". It is necessary to have faith. You must get it. I would lay this upon you, Get faith! Where does faith come from? It comes from Jesus. "Faith which is by him". If you are to reach the inheritance you must get faith. You will not need it in heaven, but you will never be found there unless you have faith here. It comes from Jesus. You come into all the wealth of things by the faith which is by Him. There is faith operative here tonight. Some of us have very little, but there will never be complete soundness unless we go the whole way. Peter shows you the way to this, faith; it is by Him. I say, *You get it*! I tell you to get it tonight.
{409}
I place that obligation on you, *Get faith*! It is the gift of God; it is an essential tool, and God gives it. It is the gift of God and it says it comes by hearing. Supplicate God and you will get it. Listen to the word of God, hear about Jesus, the Author and Completer of faith. Peter says, "The faith which is by him has given him this complete soundness in the presence of you all". It is sufficient for every man, woman and child in the universe to be saved.
Now I want to say a word on @Revelation 7. It is a great book of numbers. Christianity is no small matter. Think of the completeness of the holy city we were considering here today. Its length, breadth and height, a wonderful city! Have you ever thought of the number of persons going to make that up? In connection with the woman Jezebel, we see the great number of her children, dead; but God says, There are a far greater number of the living. God is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living. The heavenly city is composed of living persons.
Here in @Revelation 7 there is a great crowd which no man can number. These do not belong to the heavenly city, but the Spirit of God describes them for us. "These are they who come out of the great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and have made them white in the blood of the Lamb". In verse 9 we get "a great crowd, which no one could number", and then it says, "These are they who come out of the great tribulation". The reading is that they *come* out, they are that kind of people. There is a great deal of tribulation at the present time. You say, Is that the gospel? Yes, it is the gospel. We need to be delivered from this pressure, and the gospel requires that we are delivered. There is great pressure occasioned by the war. What about us? Well, you may say, I have not come out of it, that is historically, but a year from now we might be able to say, We have come through it. But these are
{410}
coming out from the tribulation. It is not that the tribulation is removed, but they are coming out of it. The Lord Jesus says that those days are shortened for the sake of the elect. They are coming out of it. It is not only that they are washing their robes: the Spirit of God does not stop there but it goes on to say they are washing their robes *to make them white*. It is beautiful! For there is washing and washing, you know. Linen is bleached to make it white. The Spirit of God makes much of the whiteness of the Lord's garments on the mount of transfiguration.
So these people have washed their robes and have made them white. How many, alas, today, ask the question, When were you saved? meaning, When did you believe on the Lord Jesus? It is a misuse of the words, because believing on the Lord is going on all the time. "Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved". Not 'thou *art* saved'. The word 'believe' means you have utmost confidence in the One you believe in; you go the whole way. You get the lob completed. The man in @Acts 16 says, "What must I do that I may be saved?". The answer is, "Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved". That is, you by yourself, but then there is another 'thou', for it says, "thou and thy house". First yourself, by yourself, and then yourself with your house. How can the house be saved unless you are saved? The jailor would understand the value of the Greek word, 'believe'. He went the whole way. Not only him self but his house. It says, he "rejoiced with all his house, having believed in God". What a scene in that house, as the jailor took Paul and Silas and washed their stripes! By the gentle hand of love the work was well done. Then he laid the table for them. He rejoiced and all his house is brought into it. The household matter is an important phase of the gospel.
So here "These are they who come out of the great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and have
{411}
made them white". Many people stop halfway and are content to have half-washed robes. You will never be able to come before the throne of God with a half-washed robe. God will not allow that. He wants us to go all the way. He would say, I went all the way, I spared not my own Son, I delivered Him up for you and you are not going all the way. I say to you young people, you cannot stand before the throne of God with half-washed robes. The blood makes them white. It is available for you. Use it! You say, I washed. But what about the whiteness? You must wash your robes and make them white if you are going to stand before the throne of God, and be able to serve Him day and night in His temple. If I would come into this I must wash my robes and make them white in the blood of the Lamb. Then God Himself can dwell among them. The Lord Jesus can dwell among them. What a privilege! It is worth while washing for such a privilege.
God "shall wipe away every tear from their eyes". Think of the service of the blessed God, as it were taking a handkerchief and wiping the tears from their eyes, sometimes putting them into a bottle! Why cannot we go all the way, and be real christians, people of real service to God, in the temple day and night? To be led by the fountains of water and to have tears. Who is there who has not had tears? There is not a christian worthy of the name who has not had tears. Think of the beloved brethren across the water, as much as we know of them; what tears for God to wipe away! What a service of the blessed God wiping away our tears! The Lord Jesus washed the feet of the disciples, and here we have God wiping away our tears. The true tears of christians are wiped away by their God. He treasures their tears, they are so precious to God that, according to @Psalm 56, He puts them in His bottle.
May God bless His word!
{412}
TWO LITTLE CITIES
@Ecclesiastes 9: 13 - 16; @Genesis 19: 17 - 22
These passages, as you will observe, speak of two little cities. The first, although little, is of sufficient importance to some great king to attack it in great force. He had his own reason for this attack. It is said to be a great king who besieged it and built great bulwarks against it. It will be my responsibility to explain what this means, why it is written in the book of God.
The other little city is introduced to us by the expressed desire of one of God's people, to be allowed to live in it instead of Sodom. He had been living in Sodom because he had some hankering after the world, and he went to live there accordingly. Now he is denied the privilege of the great city, where the world afforded much for himself and his sons and his daughters, and he would reduce his worldly desires and put them in his pocket, so to speak, so as to be allowed to live in a smaller city, only different from Sodom in size. It was intended to be destroyed as Sodom. Some of the Lord's people who are worldly, and are pressed under the government of God to reduce their worldly tendencies, still live in the world, that is, the world in a modified way. If there are any such here, the gospel will be for them, for there are many worldly Christians, old and young, and worldliness becomes intense in us as we fail to judge it. It becomes more difficult to abandon, and God is using services such as this to help them if they happen to be here. These services are in the Lord's hands to be used to deliver such, to break the power of the world in their hearts. These meetings are intended for so-called people of God, as well as others. It is the people of God normally who enjoy the gospel, are always glad to hear it, and it never fails to help them.
{413}
Now this great king had a motive. The magnitude of his attack seemed out of proportion to the size of the city, but he knows what he is about. This little city would be symbolic of the people of God in all ages. Though small outwardly, they are great inwardly. The devil knows they are great inwardly. The devil knows their relation with God. Of some of them who were small, God said in @Psalm 105, they were but few and of little account. They went from one country to another; the world did not know them; it was not worthy of them, but Satan knew them. Nowadays things are very small; we have to accept it. They are not getting any larger. We have to learn to be content in the sense of smallness, not to be idle in it, not to fail in speaking of what we have through the gospel, yet always remembering that the position is small.
This may refer to some household here. Perhaps your salary is not large, your house is small, you are not of any special notice in the community, but there is something in you that the devil understands. Hence the attack; the great king is building bulwarks against you. You are in danger. Now this has happened a multitude of times. Before Christ came He preached, that is, He preached through servants. As Peter tells us, the Spirit of Christ which was in them preached to the spirits which are now in prison (@1 Peter 3: 19). The city referred to in our scripture was small, with only few men in it, but heaven knew the value of those men, and so did the devil; and it is so today. There may be such persons in this place, and they belong to God. Now the next thing is whether the "poor wise man" is in your institution. Is the Bible recognised in the house? Is the ministry of the Spirit of God recognised in the house? Are the meetings attended? Otherwise you have no means of combating this great king. He will overcome you. If it be even one individual, you are of sufficient value if you have
{414}
any light in your soul at all for Satan to attack you. Your only hope is in affording a place for this poor wise Man. He will not set about making weapons of war after the flesh. Peter used weapons such as that, and the Lord said to him (@Matthew 26: 52), "Return thy sword to its place". He said also, '"My kingdom is not of this world" or "my servants had fought"',
@John 18: 36. So that there is no hope on that line, no support from the poor wise Man on that line. Your deliverance must come on another principle. The great king is attacking you. He knows what you are. You have not been paying sufficient attention to the poor wise Man; but still you belong to Him, you belong to that city in which He is. Satan knows about you, your father and mother and your forefathers.
Job is an example. The Lord says to Satan, "Hast thou considered my servant job?", @Job 1: 8. 'Yes', he says, 'but I cannot get at him, You are hedging him about, so that I cannot get at him'. But God says, 'I will let you get at him'. How serious that is! You may have been neglecting the meetings lately, touching the world, and you are exposed. The devil is watching you and he is prepared to attack you. In the government of God he is allowed and he does attack you. You need to pay attention to this poor wise Man. There are many who can speak intelligently about the Lord Jesus Christ, about His Person, who can quote the Scriptures and perhaps who could speak about Him to poor sinners, but, if they have been neglecting Him in regard to themselves, this mighty king will find an entrance. Something will happen that you do not expect. So it is an opportunity for some here who are bordering on the world to seek the poor wise Man. The devil knows that you are a christian, heaven knows that you are a christian, and the brethren know that you are a christian and they are praying for you, but there is no movement. God says to the devil, 'I will let you do so-and-so'. You have a lovely child
{415}
that you are nursing; God may come in and take it away. It may be killed on the street by an auto; your business may fail, or many other things may happen. Think of these four messengers that came to Job one after another, each telling a terrible tale of woe, worse than the preceding one (see @job 1: 13 - 19). These are solemn matters. The poor wise Man is in the city, He is making no pretensions, He is not forcing Himself. You have the means of help, but you are not using it; but He is available, that poor wise Man. It is said here that the poor wise Man by His wisdom delivered the city. If anything by the government of God has happened to you, what about the poor wise Man? If He has come into your circumstances, He intends to stay if you will allow Him.
The Lord says in Revelation to the last church, "I counsel thee", @Revelation 3: 18. Think of the Lord counselling Laodicea, the most worldly of the churches, rich and increased with goods and having need of nothing, and the Lord says, "I counsel thee to buy of me gold purified by fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white garments, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness may not be made manifest; and eye-salve to anoint thine eyes, that thou mayest see", @Revelation 3: 18.
What counsel will He give? This thing has happened to you. Why did it happen? What are the circumstances? The brethren have not seen much of you. The devil thinks you are worth something, and he is ready to attack you. The Lord is ready to give you counsel and He has what you need. I will just read to you the things that He spoke of there and is ready to give you under these circumstances. He says to Laodicea in @Revelation 3: 19, "I rebuke and discipline as many as I love; be zealous therefore and repent". He says in verse 18, "I counsel thee to buy of me gold purified by fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white garments, that thou mayest be
{416}
clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness may not be made manifest; and eye-salve to anoint thine eyes, that thou mayest see". That is what He is saying to you.
He is the poor wise Man from the standpoint of Laodicea. He is poor, but He is wise and will deliver you by His wisdom; He knows what you need and He is ready to provide for you on the principle of purchase. It is the Lord's way. You have the means of buying other things. As I was saying, why not think what you owe to God? It is remarkable how much people can do, and how little they can do in another sense. The Lord knows that you are struggling to get the means of purchase to get everything of this world that you need or wish. So the Lord is using that word 'buy'. It is His way to get at you. You begin to be serious, and to see how you are bartering your way for the very best in this world, and the devil knows it. The poor wise Man is ready by His wisdom to help you. The use of the word 'buy' is just wisdom, His way of dealing with you, because He knows your mind clearly. "The love of money is the root of every evil", @1 Timothy 6: 10. Evil has more than one root, but we have to learn in these days to deal with roots, and the love of money is one of the most powerful roots. Money is of no value except as I use it to buy something that I love, something that I must have whatever else happens. So the Lord says, 'Since you are on that line, I have something to sell'. It is wisdom, it is the Lord's way. He says to Job, for instance, 'You remember when the foundations of the earth were laid-you were born then?'. He just overwhelms you with the wisdom He uses to break you down. 'You were on the buying line, so I counsel you to come to Me, for I have all you need'. You were so trifling and so shallow and, when you begin to get serious, the Lord says, 'I can settle all that matter for you'. Hezekiah says, "Jehovah was
{417}
purposed to save me", @Isaiah 38: 20. In His love for me He saved me, and so it is with the poor wise Man. He knows how to use the language to get you.
You have been on the buying line. You want better things. Salaries are very big now and they are very treacherous and you sacrifice the Lord's day to get money. The devil knows it. If you will rob God of the Lord's day the devil has his way. He would rob the Lord Jesus also. The Lord knows how to reach you. He comes down to the seller's idea. He says to you, 'Change your mind, change your life; come to Me and I will provide for you. When the time comes for payment I will settle that for you'.
So there were few men within the city, but the poor wise Man was there, "and there was found in it a poor wise man". It is a question of finding Him. He has found them. He wants to find you, too. One said, "We have found the Messias" (@John 1: 41), but the truth was that Messiah had found him. Now He is to be found and, if there is anyone here in trouble at all whom Satan is attacking (he has various means), it is for you to look around for the poor wise Man. It is the present position. Do not look to the big things for help. He is found in the small ones. There was once a certain man, a negro, who wanted to get into a certain church in New York, but his colour forbad him. He therefore told the Lord about it, and the Lord told him, 'I have been trying to get in there, too, but I cannot get in either!'. You never find Him in stained-glass window buildings, or steeple churches; you will not find Him there at all. I know a man who was found in a theatre by the Lord. Did he find the Lord? No, the Lord found him! The Lord did not go in there to stay. He left as soon as He found the man. If you want Him, He is to be found, in certain places, in a place like this. At the present time God is here if you want Him.
He will come in great glory presently, glory beyond
{418}
words, the glory of Christ; He will come with many diadems upon His brow (I do not know how many), as King of kings and Lord of lords. That will be a great time. The man of sin will be there; the beast and the false prophet will be there. It is only a few years now until He comes. The beast will have an army all ready, a great improved army and great improved guns. They will all be there and the Lord Jesus will come out riding on a white horse, the great Leader of the heavenly army. The Lord is coming out in infinite greatness presently. Before one soldier is slain, the beast and the false prophet are taken and cast into the lake of fire. It is not very far off now. The Lord of glory will come out with the army of heaven, and what a difference between it and the army at the present time! The two great generals of the devil's army are taken and cast alive into the lake of fire. As King of kings and Lord of lords, Christ has a name written which no man can know. We are going to see a great display of power in Christ.
At the present time it is a small state of things. It is nevertheless a city. The devil knows the value of the city and hence the preparation for attack, and he is besieging day and night. But there is this poor wise Man. That is the attitude of the Lord Jesus. To some soul, some husband and wife with naughty children, some husband and wife who are out for worldly things and whom the devil is after, the Lord is available and He would say to you, as He would say in the book of Proverbs (and it is the very symbol of wisdom), 'I counsel thee to buy of Me, I have everything, I am Wisdom'. What is the root of the matter The poor wise Man is to be found, and by His wisdom He will deliver you and you will go free, beyond anything that you have known! The second conversion will be greater than the first one. You will come to know the Lord better than you ever have before. You have been treating Him most shabbily, you are
{419}
neglecting Him. "No man remembered that poor man". How sorrowful! Yet He is to be found, to deliver you in your desolation, so that He might have you for Himself, and that you might remember Him. He says, "My son, give me thy heart", @Proverbs 23: 26. If you are to be delivered, it is for Himself; it is that you might remember Him; "but no man remembered that poor man". How many are there here who do not break bread in remembrance of the Lord Jesus? This poor Man has done wonderful things for you, but you are not delivered yet. The Lord says, 'I am available to you to deliver you, but if I do, it is to have you, to have your heart to remember Me, to break bread with the brethren according to My direction and request'
Then the further remark is, in regard to the wise Man that wrought these things: "Wisdom is better than strength; but the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard". Are you still despising the wisdom of this poor wise Man? "For the word of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but to us that are saved it is God's power", @1 Corinthians 1: 18. That is what He is aiming at, to get us to see that. Nevertheless the poor Man's wisdom is despised. Why not go in for this poor Man's wisdom? Some great man has said that wisdom is better than strength, and yet many of the people of God are neglecting the wisdom of the poor wise Man. He wants you to remember His wisdom, and get the good of it. Others are enjoying it. Why not you?
I now make a few remarks about Zoar. It is also a little city. It comes into prominence through Lot, a remarkable character in the book of Genesis. His history is given to us as one of God's people, and we are told by Peter that his righteous soul was vexed every day, like many people who are grieved at the world's wickedness, and yet they stay in it. Not that God does not take account of your judgment of
{420}
it, but why stay there? The angels were very urgent to get Lot out; they took him by the hand. "And as he lingered, the men laid hold on his hand, and on the hand of his wife, and on the hand of his two daughters, Jehovah being merciful to him; and they led him out, and set him without the city"-that is four people, not eight, like Noah's group; but a very different group. He saved Noah, a preacher of righteousness, but here there are four of them. The sons of Lot did not want to leave Sodom. Angels represent distinct service; they are "ministering spirits, sent out for service on account of those who shall inherit salvation", @Hebrews 1: 14. Think of the hand of an angel touching us! Think of the gracious insistence of these two angels to get these four people out of this doomed city! Are you going to stay there?
You have been in the world a good while. This war is intended by the Lord to deliver many, so that they may be saved. Maybe there is one here like that; perhaps you are going to be taken to the army, possibly sent on to the battlefield. All these things must be weighed before God by young people. That is the angelic service to move your heart to get you out of the world. He might change this world in a moment. I am intending to impress you that angels are attentive. The leaders of this world are not going to have it all their own way. God is having to say in the matter. "For the eyes of Jehovah run to and fro through the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of those whose heart is perfect toward him", @2 Chronicles 16: 9. Let us therefore look into our hearts and see if God is not seeking to get us out of Sodom. The Lord Jesus says to His Father, "Righteous Father", @John 17: 25. Let us beware, for what is of the world is not of the Father. The world and the Father are opposed, and so God is certainly laying heavy strokes on humanity in order to get the elect out of the world. So the angels laid hold of the hand of Lot and his
{421}
wife and his two daughters, four of them. What a sight! What a picture to contemplate! Think of the efforts of these two angels to get these four people out of Sodom. Their hearts lingered there, and the poor wife was actually taken out by tender, gracious force, but nevertheless she looked back and became a pillar of salt. If it had not been for those angels, they would have stayed there. The Lord is seeking to help you and you are just pulling away, refusing to be helped. She looked back behind her husband and she became a pillar of salt. Would the angels do that? Let us not trifle with this matter. Angels are here now, sent out to minister to those who shall be heirs of salvation. The Spirit of God is here greater than all, striving with you. He will not always strive. She became a pillar of salt, a memorial for all time of a worldly heart, a person whose heart is in the world although linked up with the people of God.
Lot made a great plea for the city of Zoar. He was so intent on having the world in a modified way. 'Well', the angel says, 'if you cannot be helped, I will just let you go there'. You may wish to go back to the world in a modified way. You say, 'I gave up smoking, and I will give up certain companions, and then there is just Zoar'. Lot did not stay there long.
He had a bitter history after that. So that the word tonight is, 'Come forth!'. The little city is just a big city in a modified way and it is doomed by God. When God spoke to Abraham about Sodom He had this in mind. He had the whole world in mind, the clean world as well as the corrupt, so that the word is, "Come out of her, my people", @Revelation 18: 4. Let us not stay there. Do not be deceived by a modified world. It will come under judgment as the other.
It is only a matter of time. May God bless His word!
{422}
ACCUMULATION
@Genesis 6: 14 - 22; @Genesis 7: 1 - 4; @Exodus 13: 19; @1 Corinthians 10: 11
I wish to speak of accumulation, the cumulative principle which appears in the history of God's testimony, and I selected these scriptures, fully believing not only that each contains the idea, but that they link the idea. They form links in the great cumulative chain that appears in the Scriptures in relation to God's testimony. They involve persons of reliability, that is, Noah, Moses, and Paul. The last scripture is Paul's statement, a statement that did not depend upon the state of the Corinthians. It was an historical matter. We perceive that the ends of the ages have come upon the assembly, and, inasmuch as we form part of that, the statement becomes of immense importance to us. The hope is that we shall accept it as an historical fact that God has ordered that the ages should accumulate or culminate in the present dispensation.
The apostle, needless to say, was observant in addressing the Corinthians; he makes much of what God did from His own side in taking them on. He unfolded to them the testimony of the Christ. He had to do with the work there in detail and knew what had transpired. He had spent considerable time there, eighteen months at least, and had seen results from his own preaching and the preaching of others such as Timotheus and Silvanus, and had good opportunity of knowing what might be said in regard of it. Indeed, he was very lavish in his comments on the work at Corinth. It was one of his greatest works, and he did not hesitate to bring in the whole principle of christianity. He says this nowhere else. The things that happened in type in the Pentateuch were for us,
{423}
upon whom the ends of the ages have come. So that we can hang our thoughts on these three scriptures with full assurance, not only in regard to the statements themselves, but in regard to the persons involved, selected of God for cumulative as well as other purposes. The thought attaches to us so that we are not to consider ourselves isolated in any way. Each is to consider himself in this great period of God's dealings in which He has linked us together so that we should act and react upon one another and unitedly work things out, working with God and working with one another. This is stressed in Paul's communication to Corinth; indeed, he does not travel very far in his first letter before he touches the thought of unity. He had heard it was wanting in Corinth and he took great pains to stress the necessity for it, that things should be worked out together not only locally but in relation to the whole, for God's work is one. God's plan is one, God's counsel is one, God's Israel is one, God's assembly is one. God Himself is One, that is to say, One in infinitude, unity, and affection, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. "For God is one, and the mediator of God and men one, the man Christ Jesus". The matter is one, and therefore the beginning of the work must bear on the end of the work and on the middle of the work. The cumulative idea begins with the beginning and will end when all is complete. God is working to completion.
These three personages are noble enough in the sense of personality on which to hang our thoughts, and, by the Spirit aiding us, to work out this thought of accumulation. Noah is taken on here in @Genesis 6, and indeed in chapter 5, but particularly in chapters 6, 7, 8 and g. It is to show how things that preceded him are not just left where they were. They are not local happenings either in time or place; In their bearing they are universal happenings. The more we dwell on this the more we shall realise how important
{424}
each one is, not simply because they are few but because the thing is so great. It requires so many, but even the thought of fewness is an incentive to stress the necessity for unity. There is a scarcity of men, a scarcity of persons belonging to the assembly who are available. The more, therefore, is the necessity of making ourselves available and useful in this great scheme. These are outstanding persons in the work. The Lord's own remark bears on this, "My Father worketh hitherto and I work". The work goes on. I think this section of Genesis in relation to Noah shows the care God took to bring things down to us and to bring them down, not as isolated, but in a cumulative sense as belonging to the whole scheme. Hence we have the measurements of the ark and the material used, but it is the contents I have in mind. It was very carefully made and secured so that there should be no mishaps, no leakage or spoilage; the matter is going through. So we have a very large vessel, a vessel that is seaworthy and dependable, and full of living things. There was food to sustain life in the persons, in the cattle, and the birds. No children are mentioned; that is to say, it is a mature thing, what reflects the mind of God, a mature state of things in life. I just want to call attention to certain things in these verses. There were means of communication without the ark, that is to say, the communication of divine thoughts was in persons. This Bible, for instance, is inspired by the Spirit of God, but it is in the persons of believers that the word of God is in a living sense. These things are recorded for us; they are written by the Spirit of God. Holy men of old spoke as they were moved by the Spirit and they wrote too. It is all so infinitely accurate, but at the same time the earlier means of communication was in persons. There was a book too. The history of books, the idea in Scripture, is very interesting, and the first one alludes to Adam,
{425}
"the book of Adam's generations" I am not saying that there was not something in the sense of 'book' earlier, but I am speaking now of what particularly relates to what is earlier than Noah. It relates to the generations of Adam. That is to say, it was intended for help in that day, for antediluvian believers. How many there were we cannot say. The great record of them is in chapter 5 of this book. There is the cumulative principle from Adam to Enoch. He was the seventh from Adam, and in that sense the word 'seven' means more than that he was a person born and living so many years after Adam. The seventh relates to Adam; he was the seventh from him in a cumulative sense. What followed was Noah and the ark. It is a great cumulative thought: what was to be carried into another world, not leaving the previous one behind as dead and gone; not at all, for there was life in that ark. It ended in death, of course, as the Lord Jesus said, "Eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day on which Noe entered into the ark". The flood came and drowned them all, but it did not drown Noah and his sons. They were to represent what was living, and what was living was carried down in a cumulative sense, nothing lost, no leakages, nothing to be salvaged, everything intact under God. He has His vessels for this purpose, but *He* does it.
Now I wish to speak about the light that was in it. "A fight shalt thou make to the ark" (verse 16). The word here is more than 'fight', it involves noonday light. That is an important matter to keep before us; the great things of God have come to light. They are not kept in museums; the light is shining on them and life surrounds them. They are all living things. Food is only to keep life going, to sustain it. There was nothing dead there, nor is there the slightest hint that anyone died there, not a beast. Things came down in this way, illuminated from above. Light was
{426}
there and it was real fight; Noah and his family did not live in the dark. This is a most important principle, dear brethren, locally and generally-the need of light. "If we walk in the fight as *he* is in the light, we have fellowship with one another". Someone says, I have fellowship with the Lord. You will not rightly have fellowship with the Lord if you have not fellowship with the brethren, "with one another". And so it is that they had fellowship in the ark; there was nothing to hinder it. They are all moving under the direction and influence of Noah. Noah does what Jehovah directs him to do. The beasts all came to Noah. They all moved and were governed by the principle of the moment. We must always be governed by the principle for the moment. Divine principles are the same at all times. There is no great hardship therefore, and we can understand that there was plenty of occupation for the mind, food not only for the body but food for the mind. What a scene it was for all those days in which the ark floated! It does not say it was driven by any power, not driven by the wind; it was just a floating vessel, but it went through and rested on mount Ararat with everyone intact, as far as we know, no deaths at all. There are no children, nothing at all but mature persons. Let us *be* these things. That is what Corinthians teaches us, "Quit yourselves like men". In every creature there was some thought of God in a living way and it came down in a cumulative sense.
The early part of Genesis opens up in this living way. The book closes with a coffin. You say, It is a very different matter, but is it a different matter? What about the man in that coffin? What about him historically, what about him personally? What about his father, his grandfather, and his great grandfather, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob? They lived for God, every one of them. What about Joseph? He is living too. He is commanding by faith. He called
{427}
to mind the going out of the children of Israel when he was dying. How important it is to have our minds under control! The Lord's supper is intended to facilitate that. We ought to direct and control our minds at any time, about any particular thing. And so it was that, when Joseph was dying, he called to mind the going out of the children of Israel. He meant, I apprehend, that they were to go out in a living way. Joseph is going out of Egypt in a living way. His words clothed his bones with life. That is to say, our funerals would be very simple; they are not dead affairs. The burials of real christians are living. The words are living. We are burying our dead to be raised again, and we know that they are with Jesus. It is a living situation, not a dead situation. Nor is the end of Genesis a dead situation. We may say there are two funerals in the end of Genesis. Although Joseph is not said to be buried until he went to Canaan, his bones were kept in a living way; they were treasured. They are under command and they go out in a living sense. The application is that we are all going out together livingly. The apostle says triumphantly in 1 Thessalonians, "The Lord himself, with an assembling shout, with archangel's voice and with trump of God, shall descend from heaven; and the dead in Christ shall rise first; then *we*, the living who remain, shall be caught up together with them"; they first, we second, all going up together.
I only refer to these simple thoughts so that our minds might be brought into this cumulative current. What am I carrying with me? What am I adding to the brethren so that we can together go out with something? They were going out of Egypt with great property. It challenges our hearts as to how rich we are. They were going out with great property, and one of the greatest items of that property was the bones of Joseph. It indicates the faith that Joseph had. What has come down to us has come down in a
{428}
cumulative way, has come to our very bookshelves, but it is in living persons also, persons who are contemporary. There were contemporaries of Joseph, as there were contemporaries of Jacob, of Isaac, of Abraham. In each day, in their turn, they came down in a living way and with great property. When we come to Egypt the question is how to get the property out. So in @Exodus 13: 19 we have a grouping of circumstances. The people are going out militarily. They went out of Egypt with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians. They did not go out the back door; the Israelites were always front door people. We do not have to go out by the back door, nor will we if we are with God. Jehovah says to Moses, "Stand before Pharaoh"; there is nothing to fear, face the enemy. Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all Egypt. They went out arrayed, five in a rank, which is a military term meaning that they were in military order in the presence of the enemy. They went out with great property. Will the Egyptians rob them? No, they will not. If you look at those verses you will see that Jehovah is the great military Leader, a Man of war. There is great military strategy; God makes allowance for the weakness of the people. It is a most exhilarating passage.
I wish every brother and sister would look into what is associated with the carrying out of the bones of this great servant Joseph. Moses ordered that, in the very midst of a great battle, when the Egyptians were after them, they did not forget this treasure, the bones of Joseph. "And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him; for he had made the children of Israel swear an oath, saying, God will be sure to visit you; then ye shall carry my bones with you hence". That is cumulative. So the word holds me, stands by me, this cumulative idea that the saints are coming with us. We are seeing to it in our affections that they are coming with us. That is the word here.
{429}
"Moses took the bones of Joseph with him; for he had made the children of Israel swear an oath, saying, God will be sure to visit you; then ye shall carry my bones with you hence". Can I forget them, can I leave them behind? This may mean me; the Lord may take any of us through death, but that does not mean we are not taking our brethren with us. We are to keep our minds when we are dying. Joseph had a clear mind when he died. Keep the saints in mind, keep the rank of the saints to five: they went out that way. We want to go out with them, in order, and in rank. Persons can keep rank who understand the times, moving on right principles, moving under orders, keeping military array. If you are out of step, do not say that all the others are out of step with you, but that you are out of step with them. They were under orders and were to be in step, in rank with the brethren. We are going out with the dead saints, every one of them; they will not be left. In every grave they will hear the Lord's voice. "The dead in Christ shall rise first; then we, the living who remain ...". Christ is the firstfruits of those who are asleep. But I am stressing the idea that we go out with them. Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, and the children of Israel took the bones of Joseph with them. They were carrying the bones forward in a cumulative way and all culminated in the land of Canaan.
The Lord is said to change our bodies of humiliation. We are in a humble condition physically, but the Lord is coming to change these bodies into the image of His body of glory, what it is now. "When he shall appear, we shall be like him". Our bodies will have the character and power of the body of the Lord Jesus. What an array of the glory and power of Christ when all the saints, not simply those who are living, but all from Adam down, the dead in Christ, all go up together! This cumulative thought suggests that
{430}
nothing is missing; there is no leakage, no damage, all going forth in infinite perfectness by the work of God. Moses is concerned to bring with him the bones of Joseph and Israel is concerned to bring them, too. It is association. We are concerned to carry our brethren with us. If we are not concerned about the living ones at the present moment, we certainly cannot carry the dead ones. It is a stretch of faith to embrace them in our affections. We are not going without them; the saints do not go to heaven one by one. We may die one by one, but when the time of really going to heaven comes, we are all going together. We are raised up together and made to sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.
I had in mind in the passage in Corinthians, the third great pillar for my thoughts, that the apostle is speaking with perfect knowledge of the state in Corinth and the saints generally. It says, "Now all these things happened to them as types, and have been written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come". The allusion is to the dispensations in which God has been working out His thoughts, and so they are all of one piece. They come down to us and they are to be woven into our affections, all the ages-the antediluvian world, Adam's world, the Mosaic world, the Levitical world, the Davidic world, the prophetic world, all the ages of the world. All these periods of time in which God has worked, forty-two generations from Abraham to Christ. How God has been working out all His thoughts!
Now we come to a period in which the Holy Spirit is indwelling the saints; there was never such a period as this. It involves power that we can hold things together in a living way locally and generally. The more faithful I am locally, the more I shall become universal. I want to hear what God is doing. Every evidence we have of the keeping power of God gives us encouragement. All the saints are going
{431}
with us. If they are on battlefields tonight, they are coming with us. It is all one piece, and love in the grace period is so great that we can count on being able to hold things collectively, to hold the thoughts of God in our minds and our affections. The idea is concrete, not simply abstract or theoretic, but it is a concrete idea that the saints are keeping step, going out in fives, with no great pretension, but, still, in God's hand. God's hand is a high hand. It reaches up to heaven and down to the earth. It reaches down into the graves and takes the saints up into heaven.
God is a Man of war; it is what He does. We attribute everything to God, but we are to hold these thoughts together and say we are not going without one another. Think of those in the grave that we love! God is going to take them out of the grave and we are going with them; we are going out together. May the Lord help us in these thoughts!
{432}
GOD'S SHEPHERD AND GOD'S SHEEP
@Isaiah 53:6; @Psalm 119: 176; @Song of Songs 6:6
I am seeking to be of service to God and to those who are present this evening, and have read these scriptures to speak about sheep as seen in them. The passage in Isaiah is read from the great and well known evangelical chapter of the book written by the evangelical prophet. This book has served for centuries the Spirit of God, offering, indeed, great material for evangelical service, and the New Testament alludes to it especially as testifying to the glory of Christ. John, the beloved apostle of Jesus, of Christ, quotes from the prophet, and then speaks of Isaiah as having seen the glory of the Lord: "These things said Esaias because he saw his glory and spoke of him", @John 12: 41. No one really can present the gospel unless he sees the glory. One great title of the gospel is that it is "the glad tidings of the glory",
@1 Timothy 1: 11. That is the glory of God, to be sure, and Jesus is the glory of God. He is the Ark of the covenant. We are never to forget the deity of Christ, that He is God. One great servant says, speaking of Christ, "who is over all, God blessed for ever", @Romans 9:5. What a theme for the contemplation of a person, or creature of God! What a theme to speak to a creature, about God, and about His Christ, and that Christ is God, and "over all, God blessed for ever". And so it is that Isaiah is said to have seen the glory of Christ. It is called "the glory of Jehovah" in this book, and the word of the Lord in this book, when alluding to Jehovah (@Isaiah 9: 1), says that Christ would be from Galilee. It is the Jehovah of the Old Testament, the same Person "who is over all, God blessed for ever". And so Matthew, the first writer in the New Testament, tells us by the Spirit that
{433}
His name shall be called "Jesus, for *he* shall save his people from their sins", @Matthew 1: 21. His name is *Jesus* and Jesus means Saviour. Then again, "They shall call his name Emmanuel, which is, being interpreted,'God with us'". How wonderful that he could say these things-the evangelist Matthew, the apostle Matthew, once the tax-gatherer Matthew, also called Levi! He tells us these things by the Spirit. "Book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham". Then he too, quotes from this prophet (@Isaiah 7: 14 and @Matthew 1: 23): "Emmanuel, which is, being interpreted, 'God with us'". I wish to impress upon you, in speaking to you, that God is here tonight.
You say, 'He is in heaven'. Yes, true enough. He is on this earth, too: "The heavens are my throne, and the earth is my footstool", @Isaiah 66: 1. These are facts. The earth is God's footstool, where He rests His foot; you say, 'Impossible!'. It is quite possible that it is the footstool of God, that He may go there and rest His foot. It is His footstool, and He is on it. Are there any here that do not believe that? I *know it*, that God is here, God is amongst us, God is in us. It is the truth. Now this book of Isaiah, who is the great evangelical prophet, tells us and records for us the words of certain people who are learning to tell the truth. Very few indeed learn it, for men lie about themselves, and about others and about God. Isaiah tells us the words of certain men who had learned to tell the truth. There are many here tonight who are truthful inwardly, and these men learn to tell the truth. They say, "All we like sheep have gone astray, we have turned every one to his own way; and Jehovah hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all". That is about themselves.
How does every one here stand as to this? We have all gone astray, even those brought up in a christian household, who have been taught to read the Bible, and perhaps to pray, who are now grown up, yet have gone astray. The world is full of murderous things
{434}
now, and the young boys and girls are starting to take them on. The devil is preparing them for the next war. As time goes on we will find that the young people will start the next war, and the devil knows that. He is the destroyer; that is *the devil*. He incites war, and the boys get violent thoughts, *blood thoughts*. Their ears are full of hearing of blood, their eyes are full of seeing blood, they get accustomed to it, they make light of it, and they begin to do violence, for the world is full of it. So young persons are going astray, incited by the devil to violence. If there are any such here, I would say to you young people, 'Begin tonight to tell the truth'. If you are called before magistrates, you will be forced to do it. How much happier before God and the brethren, His people! It is much easier to do it before those who are sympathetic with you. They have prayed that you might be converted tonight, and, if you are to be converted tonight, you must begin to tell the truth. The truth is that you *have gone astray, you have turned to your own way*. Now is the time to turn back, for that way will lead you down to the pit that is yawning for you. "For wide the gate and broad the way that leads to destruction", @Matthew 7: 13. People take that way, and you may have a time of revelry on the way, but it may go out by the chair or the gallows. Or you may go out in ease, like that man of whom the Lord Jesus spoke, who went out with a rich funeral but lifted up his eyes in hades (@Luke 16: 23). Young people, turn away! Learn to tell the truth about yourselves! Then you will understand the truth about God. So they say, "And Jehovah hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all". That is Jesus, He is the theme in this chapter. It is my business to make that clear. It is your business to make that clear, too, telling the truth about yourself and turning away from the wide path to the path your father taught you about. That is your side. Let us never forget
{435}
that there are the two sides. God has His side, but you have yours. The side taken by man is that he tells the truth about himself, and then tells the truth about God. Then the truth means that God has been doing something to cause man to turn from his crooked way: "Jehovah hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all". That is what God was doing. In truth He was doing it from the time that sin came into the world. Man was under a curse, a terrible curse, led by the devil and by his own will. Immediately God began to undo it. What was God doing while the devil was working thus with man? He was taking up this matter of *laying on sins*.
The first man that saw what God was beginning to do was Abel, and he says, 'I will do the same. I will join in that', and he did. That was what caused him to kill the sacrifice; Abel learned how to do that, and he did it. He died in doing it and he yet speaks even tonight. And so, as I have said, God began this work. There was the tabernacle for hundreds of years. It was a sacrificial work, and it went right through. God set up the tabernacle in the wilderness; He took great pains to tell Moses how to make an altar, and to provide a family of men to do the priestly work. This went on for centuries down through history, this great work of God, *laying* on sins, "Jehovah hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all". Jesus had not yet come, but God was thinking of Jesus; He would think of Him every time an ox or sheep was slain; it is this great work of God's which runs down through history.
Now the principle we need to lay hold of is to *tell the truth*, about ourselves, and about God. He is a sacrificial God, One who laid on Jesus "the iniquity of us all". There would not be many sins to lay on at the start, but they increased down through history, especially in the wilderness. As the cattle were driven to the tabernacle the blood flowed as they were laid on the altar, it was especially so on the great day
{436}
of atonement in @Leviticus 16. God set apart that day for this work of laying on sins, a *vicarious* business. You say, 'It was just animals', but in the mind of God it was not just animals, it was *Jesus*. God always had that thought before Him. Adam was made in the image of God; in God's mind that was Jesus. And when Jesus came to walk about this earth for some years we get the account in the word: "Who went through all quarters doing good, and healing that were under the power of the devil", @Acts 10: 38. In due time, according to the testimony of the evangelists, He was slain, He was given up. That is the word that is used: "Him, given up by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye, by the hand of lawless men, have crucified and slain", @Acts 2: 23.
Those wicked hands were doing God's work! That blessed Saviour was slain, He was actually killed by them. He was killed vicariously; all the murderers on earth could not kill Him, no one could take His life. It was His own act; God delivered Him up on account of these sins. It is a miracle to be able to count all those sins. "Jehovah hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all". God did it; the work was done perfectly. @Isaiah 53: 6 is a prophetic announcement of it. What was to happen hundreds of years after is in the mind of God as if it were done. He looks on to that moment when the Lord Jesus could say to His Father, "It is finished", and He "delivered up his spirit", @John 19: 30. He did really die. And then it says, "Him who knew not sin he has made sin for us, that *we* might become God's righteousness in him", @2 Corinthians 5: 21. What a wonderful statement that is, for you young people especially! You have all gone out of the way. "All we like sheep have gone astray, we have turned every one to his own way". God takes the matter up, as I have said, in the long line of sacrifices to bring the thought into men's minds, until the actual thing took place in the death of Jesus, in
{437}
His saying "It is finished" and delivering up His spirit. There is no longer any need for the droves of cattle. It is one Sacrifice for ever, the sacrifice of Jesus; "Jehovah hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all". You say 'We shall all be saved'. No, you will not indeed! There will be lost people. There may be some lost people in this room. I know it positively. There is a class of people called by God 'lost', and they will never be saved. You say, That is a difficult thing and very puzzling if One died for all, and God is one, and there is one Mediator, "who gave himself a ransom for all, the testimony to be rendered in its own times", @1 Timothy 2: 5, 6. But, *if the testimony is rendered, it is to be received*, and it is for you to receive it. There is no one saved unless they receive the testimony. Have you young people received the testimony of God? What a testimony! It is to be received. In the first letter to the Corinthians we have an account of the gospel and the preachers, for they received it by the preachers. "But I make known to you, brethren, the glad tidings which I announced to you, which also ye received, in which also ye stand, by which also ye are saved, (if ye hold fast the word which I announced to you as the glad tidings,) unless indeed ye have believed in vain. For I delivered to you, in the first place, what also I had received, that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures; and that he was buried; and that he was raised the third day, according to the scriptures; and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. Then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the most remain until now, but some also have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles; and last of all, as to an abortion, he appeared to *me* also", @1 Corinthians 15: 1 - 8. Is there anybody that can say it is a myth? It is a terrible thing to disbelieve the wonderful testimony that God has shown. Think of "five hundred brethren at once"!
{438}
God has given abundance of testimony; the twelve were commissioned to bear testimony and to preach. Preaching is more than testimony or witness. There has to be power to preach. Witness is to show that the thing is so. The Spirit of God witnesses to the thing, to show that it was. But preaching it is *forcing it on you*. God says, 'You need preachers to make it hard for you to be lost'. You have to go against the love of God, against the twelve apostles, against Jesus, if you are going to be lost. God is making it hard for people to be lost. He is piling up things in your way so that you will not be lost, but saved. This meeting is as one of the obstacles in your way. "The word is near thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach: that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord, and shalt believe in thine heart that God has raised him from among the dead, thou shalt be saved", @Romans 10: 8, 9. The word is actually in your mouth as I am preaching, but you may be making up your mind to go out of the door lured by the devil. But God has come so near that He has put the word in your very mouth, and are you going away and going to let someone else get the blessing, and you are going to be lost? It is good to take to heart what I am saying.
Now I turn to @Psalm 119: "I have gone astray like a lost sheep: seek thy servant; for I have not forgotten thy commandments", @Psalm 119: 176. That is a remarkable thing; this man knows that he is a lost one, and he puts it upon God to seek him. Then he tells Him that he is keeping His commandments. This brings up a great deal that it is well for us to take note of. God has worked with you and you have received the gospel; now God is looking for something. Throughout the Old Testament it comes to light that God is working with men, and He would have them *understand* that He is working with them. At the beginning they
{439}
do not need to do anything; God does it all. Then a time comes when the work of God is developing, and God loves to see this development with men of His work, involving keeping His commandments and laws. Men thus become alive, understanding what God is at, and that they can start an account with God, that they can save up an account with Him, and have a credit with Him. It is not to be one-sided; it never was intended that it should be. A one-sided gospel is not the gospel. It is a two-sided gospel! James tells us that. He says, 'I will show you something with my works'. You say you have faith, but I would point you to this psalm. What a sheep this man was! What a man he was! He says to Jehovah, "I have gone astray like a lost sheep: seek thy servant" (not 'Seek thy sinner'.) I want everyone to take home the fact that this is a two-sided matter. This matter is to do with saved sinners, men that know something about saving. He says, "I have gone astray like a lost sheep", and then God would say, 'Even if you have done that, there is something else true of you'. This psalm tells of a lot that is true about him. This man knows that God will work with him, and so the 'lost sheep' is owned of God. He belongs to a class that are known of God, that are known to be saving up an account with Him; they are on easy terms with God. Some of you have been converted in recent years; what kind of terms exist between God and you? Are they easy or are they severe? It is the goodness of God that makes you easy, but the severity does, too, or does it give you pain and distress? There may be someone here that was really converted at some time and God knows it. How you walked in some way with God, and now are turned aside like a lost sheep? This gospel is for you, that you may be brought back to the sure foundation on which you began. God has done the great initial work; we need a Saviour, and God has provided One *for* us. But God works *in us*
{440}
too. And that is what this man says, "Seek thy servant". He says nothing of his sins, though he needs a Saviour in a certain sense, and he asks Jehovah to seek him. He has built up a credit account with God, and God listens to him, and goes to help him. This meeting is to help any souls here who are half-way christians. It is in order that you may become *out and out*. God is ready to help you; that is the great point. He is telling you tonight that this is a two-sided gospel. He says, 'I have converted you and given you My Spirit; what are you doing?'
That is the way with those who are going only halfway or quarter-way. This man is in that position, on that line; yet he has written this wonderful psalm of 176 verses, and at the end of it he is telling God that he needs to be sought, that he has gone out of the way.
Will God turn away from him? Never! God is ready to listen to you tonight. God is ready to take up the matter, if you will ask Him to do it. He loves to do it. When Jacob left Laban he had quarrelled with his father-in-law (a quarrel which was never healed, as far as we know), but God says to Jacob, 'I will take care of you', and He sent angels to meet him. No doubt Jacob prayed to God, and that brings up what we have been saying, that the Old Testament gives an account of men who were on easy terms with God, who had come to know God and to build up a credit with God. Abraham was said to be "Friend of God", @James 2: 23. God came to visit him one day with two others. What a glorious thing that was! What terms between Abraham and God! So with Noah, Isaac, Jacob, Joshua, David, and many others. The light of the gospel came to them in some sense they walked in it, and built up a credit account with God, living on easy terms with Him, God listening to them as to His people. God is not ashamed of such people as that. You cannot push yourself in on God, "Oh that Ishmael might live before thee!", @Genesis 17: 18.
{441}
God says, 'I do not like Ishmael', although He did something for Ishmael for Abraham's sake. Let us not hide behind that man, for God does not like him. He wants to deliver you from such. The gospel is simple, for God wants to bring you back, not only to *like you*, but to *love you*, and make you at home on a sure foundation. This sheep owns that he has gone astray and asks God to seek him. That is, you have got into a mix-up with some worldly matter and you cannot get out. God longs to help you. God says, 'I am ready to do it'. You have forgotten things you once enjoyed, even forgotten that your sins are forgiven. Just get back to the start again! God says, 'It will take time'. It is a two-sided matter. This man himself says these things. God says, 'I know that'. Take David when his prophet Nathan says to him, "Thou art the man!", @2 Samuel 12: 7.'Yes', says David as his conscience is touched, "I have sinned against Jehovah", @2 Samuel 12: 13. 'I have sinned against others too'. Maybe he was unable to say just that; that will come later, but God loves to hear such an acknowledgment from the lips of David. Nathan says, "Jehovah has also put away thy sin thou shalt not die". But David had committed a great sin, and not until the child died was he happy. That is the other side; you must take on the other side too; it is a real matter, there is judgment in it. It is a real christian that takes things on seriously. This man in @Psalm 119 took it on seriously. He says to Jehovah, 'Seek me', and He did. God hearkened to him. God loves that sort of thing. There is the other side of the gospel, too, that God has taught you to go out, and do some saving. Save your children and your house. So God answers this man, and the next psalms are full of it. They record the experience of the man. All this is a double matter, and it is for you to take it on, so that you may come into the enjoyment of that of which these psalms are full.
{442}
It is a remarkable statement in the Song of Songs, "Thy teeth are like a flock of shorn sheep which go up from the washing; which have all borne twins, and none is barren among them". There is no suggestion of straying in this flock. They are going up from the washing. Heaven looks down upon us as moving up from the washing. And what are we like? "None is barren among them". We have had a wonderful time here, indeed it has been "the washing". Heaven is watching to see what we are like. As we walk down the street, or go in cars to our homes, what are we like? Do we love one another? See the loveliness of the saints as presented in this setting, as a flock of sheep; the Lord Jesus loves that. He loves that picture in @John 10, His sheep. "I lay down my life for the sheep ... . My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me ... and they shall never perish", @John 10: 15 - 28. These are beautiful things. The Lord Jesus will never perish and His sheep will never perish. "They shall never perish, and no one shall seize them out of my hand. My Father who has given them to me is greater than all, and no one can seize out of the hand of my Father", @John 10: 28, 29. These are precious words; they are foundational words as over against certain christians talk of being saved today and lost tomorrow. "For by one offering he has perfected in perpetuity the sanctified", @Hebrews 10: 14. That is the perfect sacrifice, the one offering, of Christ.
May God bless these thoughts to us!
{443}
SCRIPTURAL CIRCUMSTANCES GROUPED
@Revelation 19: 1 - 9
These verses represent a certain group of circumstances into which Christ and the assembly enter. As loving Christ we are ever ready to make way for Him and His bride. The great lover of Christ wrote, "I speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly", @Ephesians 5: 32. No doubt Paul would always wax warm and eloquent in dealing with this great theme.
John the baptist heard the Bridegroom's voice and *rejoiced*. Paul heard the Bridegroom's voice and also the voice of the bride, and doubtless rejoiced more. The baptist is not on the same level as Paul. He is on the same level as the greatest of those born of women, which implies another dispensation, not the present one; the latter has the greatest place.
It is said as to John, "He who is a little one in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he", @Matthew 11: 11. Paul was not the least in the kingdom, although he spoke of himself as "less than the least of all saints". That he could say that is remarkable, but heaven would say he is the greatest. He would, we may be sure, stimulate his hearers as speaking of Christ and the assembly.
Now these verses treat of a group of circumstances, and as loving God and His truth we are ready to align ourselves with circumstances in which God would place us. The book of Revelation extends beyond the assembly, and it has a certain way of grouping circumstances. We are living in the midst of extraordinary developments, and we must group them in our minds so that we may have a clear perspective. We are to see how that which is of God enters into them. Luke has a way of grouping persons. It is peculiarly pleasing to see persons who
{444}
are all lovable grouped together, lovable severally and more lovable as together, for lovable companionship enhances our lovableness. But the book of Revelation groups *circumstances*, and among these great circumstances we find Christ and the assembly, and that is our present theme.
In regard to our dear young couple here, we cannot honour them more than to fink them with Christ and the assembly, and the Lord is willing to be linked with them. As they are worthy, He would be the first amongst us to lay His hands on them and identify Himself with them. Engagements and marriages "in the Lord" are of first-rate importance in heaven, as they enter into the present testimony. At the present time the Spirit is stressing the household. The devil regards it importantly, too; he wishes to destroy the very thought of it. One of his chief successes is the destruction of households, whereas the Spirit of God would fortify and consolidate these holy matrimonial relations, stabilise them, and make them what God intends them to be, adjuncts to the testimony.
And so the Lord would lay His hands on a newly married pair as they are worthy, and of course, worthiness is historical, not theoretic. And no doubt those of us who know our sister would give testimony, as to her historical worthiness, and those who know our brother are ready too, if necessary, to give testimony to his historical worthiness; for the Lord has given him a place among his local brethren. So that we may be sure that the Lord is with us in that in which we are engaged.
In the passage read, Christ and the assembly are linked with a set of circumstances, and it is in our minds that we may link very definitely Christ and the assembly with the circumstances we are in today, that is the union in marital bonds of our brother and sister. On an occasion like this we can bring forward Christ and the assembly in a peculiar way. It need
{445}
scarcely be said that the presence of the Lord as related to the assembly glorifies the moment.
He graced such an occasion at Cana, but not with the same fink of feelings in which He graces an occasion that pertains to those of the assembly. We cannot name those who were married on that day at Cana, but we do know the pair that are here: we know them, and heaven knows them. If the Spirit of God were recording this occasion, He would mention their names; their names are written in heaven, and they are worthy of being recorded at such a time.
This meeting has in view that Christ and the assembly should have a greater place in their hearts, and in all our hearts, than hitherto. The Spirit would so impress them at this moment that Christ and the assembly should never be lost sight of in their hearts and in their house.
As you will observe, the first circumstance in the scripture before us is the destruction of the great corruptress of the earth. It is a great matter at such a time as this that the idea of corruption should be thoroughly judged in our hearts. This institution, for that is what it is, a great system viewed in a feminine way, had had the historically terrible reputation of being the corruptress of the earth. It is of first-rate importance that we should have in mind that all corrupting elements, especially those liable to affect the household, should be dealt with unsparingly. The devil is corrupting households: the youth in them are being corrupted.
What is celebrated here first of all is that God has judged the great harlot which corrupted the earth, and the note of praise is, "Hallelujah". "After these things I heard as a loud voice of a great multitude in the heaven, saying, Hallelujah". How refreshing this is as regards what is going on currently! In public means of information there is nothing about heaven, but here much people in heaven are engaged with the
{446}
salvation and power and glory of God, expressed in judgment: He is being praised by a great multitude in heaven.
And the next thing is, what they are praising Him about. "True and righteous are his judgments; for he has judged the great harlot which corrupted the earth with her fornication, and has avenged the blood of his bondmen at her hand". As already noted, the thought of corruption has to be dealt with, and destroyed so far as we have power to do it. The Spirit of God enables us to do it, to destroy elements of corruption in our households. Here it is a celebration, and we are told that God has "avenged the blood of his bondmen at her hand". What blood has been shed by that awful system during many centuries!
God is bound to deal with it! Note: "And a second time they said, Hallelujah. And her smoke goes up to the ages of ages". That is a settled matter, and a most intelligent feeling celebrates it: and we may say that all the universe joins in: "And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and did homage to God who sits upon the throne, saying, Amen, Hallelujah". And then verse 5 brings in something else: "And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his bondmen, and ye that fear him, small and great", for God must be praised in every circumstance.
"And I heard as a voice of a great crowd, and as a voice of many waters, and as a voice of strong thunders, saying, Hallelujah, for the Lord our God the Almighty has taken to himself kingly power". This must be the sequel of everything: God must *reign*! And surely it must enter into the household now being formed: that, as it is formed, God must reign there, and our young couple would surely have in mind that He will reign in their household. As He reigns in a household, the saints will not fail to join in with their "Hallelujah"! Let us learn to use the
{447}
word! In the passage before us it is used four times. It is not to be slighted at all, a word denoting "Praise ye Jah", for God is praised as He reigns.
How refreshing is the thought of divine reign in a household! The household in which God reigns will contribute to the assembly in which His rule also prevails.
{448}
LEAPING
@Acts 3: 7 - 9; @2 Samuel 22: 30; @Deuteronomy 33: 22
I Have been thinking, dear brethren, of the use of the word 'leap' in the Scriptures, and what the Spirit had in mind in using this word. It is an athletic term, which is not foreign to Scripture. Perhaps we wonder at Scripture alluding to the arena and the racecourse, but Scripture was indited by the Holy Spirit, and the power of holiness is never affected by any detrimental element in the sphere of inspiration; indeed, the word in this respect is "To the pure all things are pure". And yet one would warn young minds of things that are in themselves impure-not to play with them. We may safely follow the Spirit of God in His use of language. Even the word 'dancing' has a great place in the Scriptures. It applies to physical ability in itself; the members of the body, the framework, are taxed by the exercise. God Himself, in the parable of the prodigal son, inaugurates the thought of dancing-"music and dancing". The psalmist alludes to it, "As well the singers as the dancers shall say, All my springs are in thee", @Psalm 87: 7. That is in Zion-not in the arena or field, but in Zion. That is where we are just now, to be simple. All our springs are drawn from Zion, and I think it wise to begin with an example.
The book of Acts is a book of examples. That book is rightly named; but whose acts are they? Someone would say, The acts of the Holy Spirit. But that will not do. The book is intended to convey human acts, angelic acts; acts of the Spirit of God, too, but we do better to get to the title; not that it is inspired, but it is like many other things, semi-inspired, because it has had such a holy and wide usage. It is as if heaven would say, 'The saints are to be seen in their
{449}
own setting'. The saints are in their element in this book. No one, if he is a christian, is in his element in any music place or any dance hall or any picture hall or any theatre; he is not in his place at all; he is out of his element. And the Spirit of God would say, You are to be engaged in relation to the book of the Acts. It is the place of acts, a word that is also used in a desecrated way. One of the acts is in this man that I have read of, and another one is Peter. I selected this man to begin with because it is said that immediately Peter took him by the right hand and lifted him up, "leaping up he stood and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God", @Acts 3: 8. He is immediately brought into action, but as usual, there is initiative in the divine action. The great first cause is God in anything that is of Him. And so the action here is distinctly through Peter. The man is taken by the right hand. Peter took him by the right hand and lifted him up. So that I am speaking to the younger brothers and sisters, and the idea of initiative comes down the line from God, as we had it this afternoon. He selects His vessel, and in no book do we find His selection more than in this. God is going to act and act mediately, and He is bringing in the actors. It is a great honour to have part in such a book as this.
The writer had already written to Theophilus, but lest he might be taken with what are called 'democratic' ideas, Luke is not concerned about that. He is not shutting it out either, the idea of men acting, men as men. But he has selected a man that had a place among men. You cannot imagine that God would leave all the places of distinction to the devil on this earth. We read of seven thousand names of men that were destroyed. God did not give them their names, and they were destroyed in the fall of the city, for they were of the world's system. The world
{450}
is systematised, involving individual, political, and social distinctions. The devil, of course, makes much of their names, and there were seven thousand names of men that were destroyed at once. If we were to go over the realm of 'Who's Who', we should find a good many in all the country, and they are not diminishing. Seven thousand is a goodly number. There are gradations in it, of course, but the word 'name' covers all, and they come under judgment. Well now, coming to this book, as I said, we have a distinguished man in the opening. "I composed the first discourse, O Theophilus"-it is a slight reduction; he was called "most excellent" earlier. So that we get a good start in this book, not on the line of the seven thousand names, but heavenly names. "Rejoice that your names are written in the heavens".
And so I select one of the names of this book, and he is described by the Spirit: "A certain man who was lame from his mother's womb was being carried, whom they placed every day at the gate of the temple called Beautiful, to ask alms of those who were going into the temple" (verse 2). Well, that is the Spirit's introduction of this man, this actor. He is taken from the dunghill and placed among princes. Peter ennobled him, as he does others in the book. "Peter, looking stedfastly upon him with John, said, Look on us". So that we can see how the idea of personality comes into the scriptural account the Spirit gives of this Tan; he was, of course, marked by lameness; that is, he was unfit for any distinction on athletic lines. He could never aspire to that naturally. Peter fastened his eyes upon him. These are words of great importance as to this book-what is to be worthy of our eyes. The book of Leviticus makes a great deal of the priest's eyes, and where we are defiled by sin, any of us (I hope none of us is), we have to do with the priest's eyes, that is, God's eyes through the priests. "All things are naked and laid bare to his
{451}
eyes, with whom we have to do", @Hebrews 4: 13. So the priest fixes his eyes on anyone who is erring from the truth and is turning aside. But this is not the point here; the point here would be the eyes of the apostle, the eyes of a person who had power to help. The priest's eye is discriminating. He names the thing, whatever it be, whether it be a white hair or a black hair. There is distinction as to colour, and that, of course, is necessary, but what the man needed here was a question of power. It says, "Peter, looking stedfastly upon him, with John", showing that this book brings out the idea of association with persons, two or more. It is a great thing to have two associated. I say a great thing because there is blessing in two associated together in the fellowship. But the idea of special links, making special links among ourselves, is to be abhorred. With Peter and John, if their links were special it was because they were formed by the workmanship of Christ; they were made fishers of men. The Lord said to Peter and Andrew, I will make you fishers of men. They were made by the Lord, and their special links are safe. They are associated in what the book indicates, which is the fellowship. The fellowship of the apostles is really one of the leading points in the book. "Our fellowship is indeed with the Father, and with his Son" (@1 John 1: 3); the twelve of them are linked in special fellowship, and here Peter and John are linked together. But Peter was the one who looked on the impotent man; he fixed his eyes on him. It is a most serious matter to offend the divine eye in that sense, because it acts mediately; it acts through others, and in this case it was on the poor lame man who had no distinction at all save that he was lame and a beggar. But he is going to be distinguished, taken up from the dunghill and set among princes. That is what is going to happen, and that is what has happened to all of us who are christians, and I believe
{452}
most of us have been taken from the dunghill and set among princes. Therefore how great it is to have men linked together by heaven; one of them fixed his eyes on this man. Later on, another great servant (that is Paul, another great actor in the book) has to do with a similar man, and it is said of him by the Spirit that Paul saw that he had faith to be healed. That is not said of this man, but it is true of him, as the sequel shows. I would remind the brethren of the necessity for having faith if we are to come into the things of God at all, or to have any part in what He is doing. "Without faith it is impossible to please him", @Hebrews 11:6. It says of the man whom Paul healed that he "heard Paul speaking, who, fixing his eyes on him, and seeing that he had faith to be healed, said with a loud voice, Rise up straight upon thy feet and he sprang up and walked", @Acts 14: 9, 10. He was raised in the same sense, but I am not going to speak further of him. My point here is that he leaped up, it says, "Peter ... having taken hold of him by the right hand he raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankle bones were made strong".
I want to work up from the bottom in this man. Most of us work from the top, even spiritually, and in a certain sense that is right, because God needs our mouths and eyes and ears, but then we may stop too soon in the downward course. This man began down at the bottom, his feet and ankle bones. So we must not hide behind our diseased feet. Mephibosheth was lame on both his feet, and sometimes we say his feet were under the table, but not always. You cannot always hide your feet under the table. There are feet-examiners as well as eye-examiners, and you have to look after your feet, where they take you and where you go. You cannot hide your feet. You cannot say, My heart is right but my feet are not. You cannot hide behind your feet when you have bad ways. The feet must be dealt with, and that is the first thing that
{453}
is in mind here. It says, "And having taken hold of him by the right hand he raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankle bones were made strong". Where would those feet go now? Our feet need examining. Jesus feet were feet for anointing and the woman in Simon's house did that. His feet are mentioned several times. Many of us have often touched on the frequency with which the word 'feet' is introduced in @Luke 7. But there was one person there whose feet could hardly be anointed then, but she anointed the feet of Jesus. She knew those feet deserved anointing. The Lord later said to her, "Go". That means, 'Use your feet', and it implies that her feet were affected. The Lord's feet were anointed by her with myrrh. How beautiful that she should have myrrh! If God is working with us and things are to be done, we shall have the means wherewith to do them. The Samaritan had the means wherewith to look after the needs of the poor man that fell among the thieves. He had the means with him, and so had the woman in Simon's house. She certainly did not borrow from Simon, and the Lord in due course said to her, "Go". How could He say, "Go" to her unless she had feet that could be guided? She would never go to a picture show any more with those feet. She would not go anywhere that could not be approved by the divine eye.
Well now, here you will observe that "immediately his feet and ankle bones were made strong. And leaping up he stood and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God". Now I just touch on these matters, because spiritually we are simply out of it unless we are in these things, simply out of it as to any special recognition of heaven: first the feet, then the ankle bones, then the idea of leaping, then the idea of walking, and then the idea of praising God. But where did the thing begin? Sometimes we seek to help souls, and
{454}
we meet people that have no record at all of their spiritual birth, no record of their conversion, no record of any such event as this. Well, their christianity is simply doubtful; it is just doubtful and worse. There must be a beginning spiritually. There must be a beginning in everything. If the creation is made out of nothing, its beginning is with God. Jesus is the first-born of all creation. There must be a beginning, and anyone who has no record of his beginning is just out of it. He is doubtful, and I should not go around this world with any such papers. They are no papers at all; they have no credentials in them. Even if I have had credentials I have not got them now. All this is what is going on now -- what can I use now in my walk and ways? My point here is that the leaping is first. That idea is stressed. He leaps, and that immediately. Peter looked on him and took him by the right hand, that is where the link is. The universe is one thing; judaism is one thing; Israel is one thing; christianity is one thing; the human race is one thing. It has a beginning, and so with each of you. You must go back to the beginning. Whence the beginning? Here the beginning is not that Peter fixed his eyes on the man, or even that he gave him his right hand, but that is really the point. He fixed his eyes on him, took him by the right hand and lifted him up. At any time in the future you may be certain this man would say, I will never forget that, when Peter took me by the right hand. It was a transaction. It was a delegated transaction. It was from God, and that is the way it is with every christian. What are they without history? I must have a history in heaven, and what is my history among the brethren? It must correspond with heaven if it is real. And this man's history really was morally in the link that Peter established with him in taking him by the right hand, and the power began there. It was delegated power flowing out
{455}
through Peter to him. Now what I am saying is most important, because we are challenged constantly as to our history, and as to what we are at the present moment; and what we have to bring forth.
One could say a good deal about the papers we have to carry now. Aliens have to carry certain papers, or to be sure they have them within ready reach. The Government relies upon us. And so it is with those in the assembly, the searching character of the Spirit of God is sure to light upon us, to fix His eyes on each of us. And then there is this matter as to whether I have got any power. Peter took him by the right hand and lifted him up, and he, leaping up, stood. He never needed Peter's support again. It is what I get inwardly by the link which is from God. This man, we are told, leaped up, and as I said, illustrates the idea of superiority, beginning down at the bottom with the feet and ankle bones, and reaching up to the knees; it applies, as we get elsewhere, to the loins, so that we are able to swim. We must know something about all these members and their actions, and swimming is another divine word. "Waters to swim in", waters are waiting for the believer to swim in, and without these members that I mention, we cannot swim, nor can we leap. This man leaped and walked and then afterwards walked and leaped, as much as to say, we are going back to the proper order. When I was a babe, I began to walk, maybe when I was twelve or fifteen months. I did not leap then. So that the first idea is the transmission of power as a believer through the right hand. He leaped up and "stood and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God". That is the order in which the power comes and operates. That is the general idea, I have power to leap, but that definite order is in mind, and I go back to the walking, and then to leaping, and then to praising God. That is a very wonderful thought, standing in
{456}
the assembly and praising God, but what about the feet? We come afterwards to dancing, but you need the feet for dancing, the whole being is brought into the thing, the Spirit of God operating in each member. It is a living situation, dear brethren, that is in mind and the order that God has is walking first. Naturally, it would be creeping, but it is not creeping here. It is walking, first, and then leaping. He is walking and leaping and praising God, and it implies that I am doing this in the strength that I have. I have the strength in myself that I need for walking and leaping, and I am turning it to account and praising God.
This is, I might call it, the beginning of my subject, and I cannot go very far beyond, just enough to get to this idea of being made to live by the heavenly touch, and that we are to be associated together in our praise. No one is to be like a wandering star, which is out of hand. The morning stars were not out of hand when they sang together. Dear brethren, these are great thoughts for us, practical thoughts for us to have, so that we might praise God in the leaping and in the walking, reverting to the source of the power, that is, God. We are made to live also, but the whole idea is that of reverting to the source, so that he praised God. And then it is said not only that he did that, but all the people saw him walking and praising God, as much as to say that we must have the walk anyway. The leaping may be left out. It is already there, but the walking and the praising God are normal things among christians, but not praising God by itself. It is the walking and praising God that the people saw, and it is a great testimony, that you can walk and at the same time praise God; people take notice of that.
Well now, in Samuel, I only want to show how the idea proceeds in the believer. There is great education in this second book of Samuel that touches on this matter of leaping, and that is what we saw in @Acts 3.
{457}
David says, "For by thee I have run through a troop; by my God have I leaped over a wall". David is a believer; he is a type of the believer and his song is largely due to his experiences with God. "I have been young, and now am old, and I have not seen ...".
That is where he has it. This is his dying word. Let us face that. It is for us, no doubt, dear brethren. The coming of the Lord is near, but for most of us it may be death. For David, it was very near in this chapter. He speaks about the last words of David.
It is how you are in the last moment, you know. One wants to be right in the last hours. This is largely David's book, the first and second books of Samuel, but especially this second book. The twenty-second chapter is a great song, one that David had composed; it may be a great deal earlier as he incorporated it in the Psalms, in the first book, and he says, I will put a title in the beginning of it. That makes it worthy of its place in the book of Psalms; it is a song here.
@Psalm 18 is this song, and verse 30 here says: "By my God have I leaped over a wall"; it is not simply by God, but by my God. He had a God, you know. Sometimes you are prone to ask some brother or sister, Who is your God, whom do you worship? David says, "My God", Paul says, "My God"; Jesus says, "My God". And I thank God that I can say that, "My God". Paul says, "But my God shall abundantly supply all your need according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus", @Philippians 4: 19. And so David says here, "By my God have I leaped over a wall". That means a lot, you know. He had overthrown the Philistines by his God, and he did many other things by his God, and he could have said that these things were done by God. But he says *he* did them by "my God". Let us get the idea not only to walk and leap and praise as the result of a touch of Peter in the first flush of conversion, but let us learn through real experiences, because David is a man of
{458}
experience and he can tell us of many things that he did by God, and one was that he leaped over a wall by God. Many an athlete has leaped over a wall, but not by God. Many of us have perhaps leaped over a wall, but not by God; that is, we get into difficulties, even dangers it may be, and we get out of them by our own ingenuity or cleverness it may be, but that is not what David says here. He says it is not by them but by God. I would like to ask what wall it was and why it was he had to do that. Paul had to go over a wall. It does not say that he leaped over it by God nor by any one. He was let down by the brethren. It is worth while to face that; that one can submit oneself to the brethren. He escaped from the king of Damascus through the way the brethren let him down. It is a very wholesome thing to be let down sometimes. They lowered him over the wall through a window. It is a remarkable thing that there should have been a window in the wall at Damascus. We read of the street called Straight, but I think it would be very interesting to know what that window in Damascus was like. I believe that street is there to this very day, but I do not suppose there would be any monument set up to commemorate the window. Paul says, I was let down through a window and I escaped his hands. But the brethren did not help David. We may get into straits by ourselves, and none of us is much when we get into a strait. When you get into a strait things seem despicable, but God can take you out of them, and that is what David has in mind here. He was in some strait place, and God enabled him to leap over a wall. We are told in one instance that when Saul was set to slay him, his wife Michal, who had enough good in her to let him down by a window, helped him to get over a wall to flee his father-in-law. The devil attacks us through our natural relatives sometimes. They are close to us and have some advantage, but then the Lord used Michal, who
{459}
was a natural relative, to save David, but he is not alluding to that here. He is alluding to some other wall, and says, "By my God". I am stressing now that it is the simple thought of experience. David is picturing himself as a man who learned how to use God. Pardon my using that expression, but he says, "By my God", and that is superiority. "By my God have I leaped over a wall".
In @Deuteronomy 33 Moses, the man of God, blesses the tribes of Israel; some of the tribes are not mentioned by name, but Dan is not left out. He is left out in other places, but not in this; as much as to say, if Dan is the first to introduce idolatry into Israel, he straightened it out. If a man or brother gets into difficulty, sometimes you think you can say just anything against him. People are very free in saying things against a brother if he has a bad name. It is a horrible thing to have a bad name, but it can be changed into a good name. Why not? God blesses, you know, as well as curses. The book of Deuteronomy has a blessing and a curse, but this chapter is not a chapter of cursing. It is a chapter of blessing, and that is why I venture to speak of Dan as he is here. I would say to anybody who has a bad name, and has himself to blame for it, that God can change that name and turn it into a blessing. Dan, when his father was blessing, was included like the rest, but at the same time Jacob says, "Dan will be a serpent on the way ... which biteth the horse's heels", @Genesis 49: 17. The allusion is to Dan the bad, Dan the apostate, Dan the idolator, but he is Dan the blessed. He was blessed of his father and that blessing can never be reversed. We must be on our guard about saying what we like about a brother or sister who may have a bad reputation, because in spite of what was said about Dan in @Genesis 49, he was blessed. It is a question of what a man is as the subject of the work of God, so do not forget what he has been or what he
{460}
really is abstractly. Dan was blessed according to Jacob's blessing, and now Moses has a say in the matter, and Moses is the lawgiver. I would be more afraid of Moses than of Jacob. Pardon my homely remarks. I would be much more afraid of criticism from Moses, because he is the lawgiver. He has a peculiar place with God, and he is now saying something about Dan, and he is not telling us that he bit the horse's heels: Moses is not saying that here. Let us have our blessing words ready and forget many of our cursing words! Cursing is necessary at times, but blessing is always necessary. When there is nobody to bless on earth, then the Spirit of God is not on the earth. There is always somebody to bless. You say, What about Adam and Eve? how long did they remain without a blessing? A very, very short time. There was somebody to bless all the time while Adam sinned. I want to be among those who bless and curse not. Let us learn to bless, as Moses here is blessing. "And this is the blessing wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel", @Deuteronomy 33: 1. He was king in Jeshurun. He has a great charge. He is king among the righteous and dwells among an upright people; I would be afraid of anything that is to be arraigned or condemned if Moses sits down on the judge's seat. The Lord speaks of those that sat in Moses seat, and there is such a thing as that. Let us not forget that! that there is such a thing, but then the Moses who is there is the blesser. Our Moses is Christ, and He went up to heaven blessing. He stretched out His hands and blessed them, and so it is now. And that is why I ventured to speak about Dan, not as under a curse. As in Christ, he is blessed, whatever else you make of him. God blessed him. It says in verse 22, "Dan is a lion's whelp; he shall leap from Bashan". We have got to find out about this brother-how he has got out of the difficulty. He has got into an unholy place, and he
{461}
has got out of it. He has gone up in power. What can I say about him now? He is out of it. Bashan is called the great place of strong ones, there are bulls there that encompass Christ, but that is not the point. We must read Scripture contextually, and if a man as seen in this chapter is blessed by Moses as leaping from Bashan, then Moses is saying something of him as a brother, and we are to leave off our cursing for a little while. We may have to use it again, but leave it off. Dan is blessed. He is left out of it sometimes, but he is blessed, and the blessing is irrevocable. "The gifts and the calling of God are not subject to repentance", @Romans 11: 29. And so it is that I ventured to bring Dan in last after David, a man who learned to do things by God. This man learned to do things in his own power and to do big things; leaping from Bashan belongs to Deuteronomy, and we are to understand Dan, what he has been. Moses says, Do not disrespect him any more. He belongs to the blessed. He is of the family of the blessed. He is amongst those of whom it is said, "What hath God wrought!". So we are to learn not simply to leap, or leap over a wall, but to leap from somewhere. Dan has been in Bashan and has leapt out of it. May God bless the word!
