THE KING AFTER GOD'S OWN HEART
@John 18:33; @Genesis 14:18 - 20; @Deuteronomy 33: 4; @2 Samuel 23:1 - 4
My intention is to present kingship as it is seen in Christ, and I believe it is brought before us in these four scriptures. I think it is necessary to present this subject, on account of the general trend towards lawlessness in the world, and also on account of the negligence of the saints with regard to the commandments of the Lord. The apostle Paul said that he was "legitimately subject to Christ" (@1 Corinthians 9:21), and that the proof of spirituality is seen in that we recognise the things that he wrote to the Corinthians as being "the Lord's commandment", @1 Corinthians 14:37. "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment".
In the passage which we have read in John, Pilate asks the Lord: "Thou art the king of the Jews?" Jesus answers with another question: "Dost *thou* say this of thyself, or have others said it to thee concerning me?" This answer is in keeping with the character of John's gospel: "Dost thou say this of thyself?" Being developed spiritually, as the result of the work of God in us, we are able to form thoughts of Christ and to communicate them. Too often Christians repeat what others have said to them. It is true that we ought to learn from one another; but even in that case there is the result of the work of God in the believer. To quote an example, in chapter
{2}
9, the man born blind was "of age", and was able to speak concerning himself; he could express himself by himself. It is of all importance that we should learn to speak by ourselves. You will find other examples of it in the gospel, such as the words of Philip to Nathanael, and what the Samaritan woman said to the men of the city.
Pilate had no personal knowledge of Christ; he possessed nothing himself. This is true of professors, and even, alas! of many believers. The work of God in us results in our being able to speak by ourselves. On the objective side, there is that which God presents to us to be believed; afterwards, there is the intuition which the work of God produces in us. It is by the Holy Spirit that we say, "Lord Jesus" (@1 Corinthians 12:3); and it is by the Spirit that we cry, "Abba, Father".
But I wish to speak of the King. Christ was born to be King: "I have been born for this", He said. The magi enquired concerning Him who was *born* King of the Jews, "Where is the king of the Jews that has been born", @Matthew 2:2. Nimrod is the first king mentioned in Scripture, but he was not born king. It is said of him that he "began to be mighty on the earth", @Genesis 10:8. He acquired power: it is the principle that supports every human king, while Jesus was born King of the Jews. "I have been born for this, and for this I have come into the world, that I might bear witness to the truth". He was born King, and He showed that He was King by exercising the power which was His. All who were enlightened and had right instincts according to God, saw the King. Nathanael said, "*Thou* art the king of Israel" (@John 1:49); and later on, even a brigand by His side upon the cross, discerned the King. Those who have right spiritual instincts will not be deceived by the king who is to come; he will come in his own name, claiming to do great things. But Jesus came in His Father's name; He came in meekness. "Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold
{3}
thy king cometh to thee, meek", @Matthew 21:5. It is essentially important that Christians should have a right idea of the King who was born in order to bear witness to the truth. The magi had a true conception of Him they followed His star to the place where He was and they did Him homage. "Every one that is of the truth hears my voice", He said. Pilate was outside of all that, and he asks: "What is truth?" Such is the question that unbelievers present. Christ Himself is the truth; so that, from John's point of view, everything is expressed in His Person. He is the King; and the whole truth of the kingdom is manifested in Him.
In the Old Testament we have illustrations of what is presented in the New Testament. Kingship according to man is seen in Nimrod and in Saul. Nimrod made *himself* king; Saul was made king *by the people*. There are thus men who establish themselves kings, and others who are established kings by others.
In contrast with Nimrod, "a mighty hunter before Jehovah" (@Genesis 10:9) we have Melchisedec, king of righteousness, king of Salem (that is to say, king of peace). Nimrod, a mighty hunter, had no scruple with regard to his neighbours; he was independent, a lawless man, using God's creatures solely for his personal pleasure. He went out towards Asshur and built Nineveh. He continually advanced to extend his empire, having only his personal greatness in view. He is a type of the great warriors and conquerors who appeared after him; he is also a type of him who is yet to appear, who comes in his own name. But Melchisedec is "king of righteousness"; and being king of righteousness he is "king of peace"; then he is "priest of the Most High God", "Possessor of heavens and earth". Nimrod and all whom he represents must disappear; but Melchisedec remains; he is the king whom God has established. In Melchisedec we see the thought of God concerning the king. He brings out bread
{4}
and wine; he represents the grace of Christ which meets the needs of our souls. The League of Nations would like to establish peace, but righteousness is necessary first; the rights of God and the rights of men must be recognised. David recognised the rights of all when he said to Araunah, "I will in any case buy them of thee at a price", (@2 Samuel 24:24) and he bought Ornan's threshing-floor for the full price. That forms a striking contrast with Ahab and Jezebel who took possession of the vineyard of Naboth, the Jizreelite, after having killed its rightful owner.
The king according to flesh is presented to us in @1 Samuel 8:10 - 18. He gives nothing, but exacts this and that. Melchisedec gives; he brings out bread and wine; he encourages and refreshes. By such a king, men are helped; they are delivered from the power of Satan, protected and fed. They are secured for God; they glorify Him and worship Him. It is thus that having brought everything to pass for God, Christ delivers up the kingdom to God, that He may be all in all; @1 Corinthians 15:24 - 28.
In the first book of Samuel, we have first of all the desires of Hannah, and the answer to those desires in Samuel; in the second place we have the desires of the people, and the answer in Saul; in the third place, we have the desires of the heart of God, who brings in His King. God brings in His King according to His eternal thought. In the book of Ruth (which immediately precedes that of Samuel), we find the royal line, the genealogy of David, his ancestors, before he himself comes on the scene. So, in creating Adam God had Christ before Him. In the first book of Samuel, God is occupied with David, who is the man after His own heart, the king according to His counsels. At the outset, Samuel was not ready to discern the king: Samuel would have chosen Eliab, looking on the outward appearance; in that case, he was not at the height of divine thoughts, so that
{5}
Jehovah reproved him. When David appeared, ruddy and of a lovely countenance, then Jehovah said, "Arise, anoint him; for this is he", (@1 Samuel 16:12).
I pass now to chapter 33 of Deuteronomy. Moses "was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together". Moses had commanded a law to Israel; it was not a law of irritation. Someone has said that the world is a mutual irritation society; but the law of God did not produce that effect. Never was there such a law commanded. The law commanded by Moses was "the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob". It was based on love."Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy understanding. This is the great and first commandment. And the second is like it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself". There is nothing there which could irritate. In @Deuteronomy 6:5, where we find this quotation, the law is presented in its spiritual import; even a bird's nest was not to be disturbed (see @Deuteronomy 22:6,7). In chapter 11, it speaks of days of heaven on earth, "as the days of the heavens which are above the earth"; we enjoy them in so far as we are subject to our Moses -- Christ -- and understand the kingdom of God exercised by Him. Men speak of making the earth habitable, while the opposite is taking place. The law of Moses made provision for all; it was concerned even with a bird, as I have said. It was the "*inheritance* of the congregation of Jacob". Those who understood the law and appreciated it regarded it as an inheritance.
The law-giver was "king in Jeshurun". Jeshurun means "Uprightness". Moses was king in the affections of the people of God; he was accepted as such by those who were upright in heart. If one had asked the people: What do you think of Moses? the answer would have been: Moses has given us such a law as there had never been, a law which has
{6}
had no equal, and we love the law-giver; we love Moses. Nothing was passing: all was solidly established. When the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together, Moses was recognised as king: "he was king in Jeshurun".
In @Psalm 119, we see how the law was loved. If the law was so precious, what feelings of affection it must produce towards him through whom it was given, towards God who gave it! By the power of the Spirit, the law is fulfilled in us. "His commandments are not grievous", @1 John 5:3.
In @2 Samuel 23, we have the description of the true king, the impression which David received of the king. "The ruler among men shall be just, ruling in the fear of God; and he shall be as the light of the morning, like the rising of the sun, a morning without clouds; when from the sunshine, after rain, the green grass springeth from the earth". David himself did not answer to that. In Christ alone do we see perfectly David's conception as to the king. He is the King after God's own heart, and He will sit as Priest upon His throne; @Zechariah 6:13.
May God lead us all to know Him thus, and bless His word to us!

HOW WE OUGHT TO RECEIVE THE WEAK
@Proverbs 30:29 - 31; @Romans 15:1 - 7
-- Our subject this morning was the kingdom as it is presented to us in Christ, when He said to Pilate that He was born to be King. We considered Melchisedec, Moses and David, as illustrations of what the king is and of the kingly office which is presented to us perfectly in Christ. In virtue of the position of Christians with relation to the King, the kingly features seen in Christ ought to be reproduced in us. It is not merely a question of the position and office which they involve, but of moral power which accompanies the one and the other, so that we learn to act in a manner suitable to the King. In the book of Proverbs, we see how this moral power is developed in the kingdom. The four things that have a stately step are presented to us in the order in which they are reproduced in the Christian. The lion represents the believer who has been made courageous, so that he confesses with his mouth that Jesus is Lord. The smallest believer in Christ does not fear opposition. The lion "turneth not away for any". It is in this way that kingly features begin to show themselves by this courage in face of opposition. Then there is the war-horse. The lion does not fear opposition, but a war-horse goes forward to attack. "He goeth forth to meet the armed host ... neither turneth he back from before the sword ... . He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage, and cannot contain himself at the sound of the trumpet: At the noise of the trumpets he saith, Aha! and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting" @Job 39.
-- Was Mordecai an illustration of the lion, when it is said that he bowed not, nor did reverence before Haman?
{8}
-- Yes, just so. It is said that the righteous is bold as a lion. The lion, in the presence of opposition, gathers fresh forces which support him to go further; and then, he can attack as a war-horse. The lion becomes the war-horse. He discerns where the enemy is attacking, where the brethren would be inclined to let the truth go, and he attacks. The war-horse does not act independently, but he acts in connection with the line of battle; he is controlled. He receives the command of the captains, all the orders given; he learns to be controlled; he takes his place under control and not in independence. Like the men of war who came to David, to Hebron, they know how to keep rank in battle array.
-- In Colossians it says, "Seeing your order, and the firmness of your faith in Christ" @Colossians 2:5.
-- That is what is seen in the epistle to the Philippians: "In order that ... I may hear of what concerns you, that ye stand firm in one spirit, with one soul, labouring together in the same conflict with the faith of the glad tidings; and not frightened in anything by the opposers" @Philippians 1:27,28.
-- We have then the he-goat which represents one who learns to withdraw to be alone with God. The he-goat represents someone who has become fully developed in withdrawing to be with God, as Moses was with God on the mountain. Then, in result, we have kingly power; none can rise up against the king: when Moses came down from the mountain, he had against him all the thousands of Israel, who were in the wrong; and he resisted the whole camp. There is the lion, the war-horse, the he-goat and the king against whom none can rise up! He was a man characterised by great moral power.
-- All this is developed in the book of Numbers, in chapter 21, after the brazen serpent, that is to say after the reception of the Holy Spirit typically.
{9}
-- It is always in the power of the Spirit alone that we can realise these things.
-- After the reception of the Spirit, presented typically in chapter 21, where it is said, "Rise up, well!" the people begin to move, take cities, overcome difficulties. Then comes Balaam, who wanted to curse the people, but he is obliged, in spite of himself, to express the thoughts of God towards the people. The principal subject of Balaam's first discourse is separation: "It is a people that shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations" @Numbers 23:9. Then, in the second discourse, it is said, "Jehovah his God is with him, and the shout of a king is in his midst" @Numbers 23:21. That is what results from separation. In order to hear the shout of a king, separation must be accepted and maintained. In Balaam's third discourse it is said, "His King shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted" @Numbers 24:7. The King of Israel, Christ, is higher than the greatest man according to flesh. The believer, viewed in his position in relation to the King, is greater than the greatest of this world. A man who has the Spirit of God, and leaves Him free to act, is greater than the most intelligent of this world. None can rise up against the king. "The shout of a king" -- a song of royal triumph is heard among the people of Israel; this shout comes from a people who have typically received the Spirit.
The Lord Jesus was not only down here as the King after God's own heart, but all the features of the king have been manifested in Him. All the features characteristic of the kingdom have been manifested in Him as Man. He went about doing good, delivering all who were under the power of the enemy, and His disciples, after His departure, had the same power and acted likewise.
-- "The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking,
{10}
but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit" @Romans 14:17.
-- In the epistle to the Romans, the truth of the kingdom is presented in connection with us, and is developed. In chapter 13 it is the kingdom of men, magistrates, rulers, the authorities that exist and whom we respect; but in chapters 14 and 15 it is a question of the kingdom of God. So we find in chapter 14 the truth of the kingdom which is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, peace and joy. If the features of the kingdom are in some little measure developed with the believer, the result will not be his own exaltation. We read that those who are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please themselves. The more the features of the kingdom are developed in us, the more we shall be characterised by humility. Without that, one would be disposed to think oneself of some importance. Like Christ, I ought to be meek and lowly in heart, "for the Christ also did not please himself". In chapter 15 it is a question of displaying this kingly power by the way in which we receive those who come to us. At the beginning of chapter 14 it says, "Now him that is weak in the faith receive" (Romans 14:1), which means that if kingly power is developed in me, I ought to use it for the encouragement of the weak. David shone in the way in which he received those who came to him. In chapter 12 of the first book of Chronicles, it speaks of those who came to David in three different positions: first at Ziklag, secondly in the stronghold in the wilderness, thirdly at Hebron.
Ziklag answers to the epistle to the Romans, where the truth is developed that everything has been lost by sin, but that everything has been recovered. Those who understand that will never be discouraged. Ziklag was the darkest day in David's history. He wept until he had no more power to weep (@1 Samuel 30:4), yet David had a great deal of power to weep.
{11}
Then it says that David strengthened himself in Jehovah his God (verse 6). He recovered all. That is Ziklag. One who has come to Christ at Ziklag will never be discouraged.
Those who came to David in the stronghold in the wilderness were not discouraged either. There was nothing for them according to flesh, in the wilderness; but they had the protection of the stronghold. That is the first epistle to the Corinthians, the fellowship.
-- We enter into the kingdom, and by that means we are prepared to enjoy the fellowship.
-- The stronghold means protection. Salvation is in the stronghold. The name of Jehovah is there. "The name of Jehovah is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe" @Proverbs 18:10.
Hebron suggests what is outside the world. It says that Hebron was built seven years before the greatest city of the world, Zoan in Egypt; @Numbers 13:22. At Hebron we breathe an atmosphere in which all that is of the world, of Egypt, has no place. That is the epistle to the Colossians.
-- With regard to David, who was at Ziklag and wept, would there be a similarity to Gethsemane? "His sweat became as great drops of blood".
-- Yes, there is a great analogy. All was indeed lost at Gethsemane, but the true David has recovered all; where everything appeared to be lost, in reality everything was gained.
There are the features which mark those who are really gathered around Christ! These features mark those who are specially named in connection with Hebron. There were only priests: prayer is a characteristic feature of the epistles to the Colossians and Ephesians. All that is before us in Colossians and Ephesians is so great, so high, so wonderful, that one feels that only the power of God can hold us up. It is so great that only prayer can maintain us in the presence of it all. When we arrive at Hebron, we
{12}
fall on our face to the earth; we are in the presence of what is wonderful, outside the world, far above the world and its glory. We fall on our knees to worship: we take off our shoes. "For this reason", says Paul, "I bow my knees to the Father" @Ephesians 3:14. Jehoiada and Zadok (@1 Chronicles 12:27,28) are the two priests named as having come to David to Hebron. In all the various positions that he filled, David received those who came to him. It is a matter of our learning to receive in kingly dignity. We have to discern whether those who come and wish to be received have faith. It is a question of him that is weak, but in faith. And he that has faith, even if it may be small, has no place outside the circle; his place is within and not without, although his faith may be weak. David had captains of hundreds. He that is weak cannot be a captain; nevertheless, his place is within.
-- It says, "Receive (him), not to the determining of questions of reasoning" @Romans 14:1.
-- It is a matter of our reflecting heaven in the way in which we receive those who draw near. It says, "Receive ye one another, according as the Christ also has received you to the glory of God" @Romans 15:7. It is according to the dignity of the anointing: "the Christ" is the Anointed.
-- It is very important not merely to receive, but to receive "as the Christ".
-- What is the difference between the kingdom and the assembly?
-- In the kingdom we have protection, salvation. The assembly receives into its bosom those who come. The assembly ought to be down here as a reflection of heaven. When Saul of Tarsus was to be received the heart of Christ was willing to receive him and He received him royally. He prepared Ananias to receive him in a heavenly manner. Christ teaches
{13}
us how we can and ought to receive the weakest who has faith, and who consequently acknowledges the authority of the Lord. Although weak, he is a brother. All that calls for spiritual discernment. If the moral features of the kingdom are developed in us, we shall have discernment. The object of the book of Proverbs is to produce in us what we have at the end of the book, as to the woman in whom her husband can confide -- the woman of worth. "The heart of her husband confideth in her" without reserve. The Lord expects us to know how to receive those whom He has Himself received. They must not be left out in the cold, but received into the assembly, if *they have faith*. All the faith and intelligence one has should be available to the one who wishes to be received. The children of Benjamin and the children of Judah came to David. "And David went out to meet them, and answered and said to them, If ye come peaceably to me to help me, my heart shall be knit unto you; but if to betray me to mine enemies, seeing there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers see it and rebuke it" @1 Chronicles 12:17. Those who came here -- Benjamin and Judah -- were David's kinsmen. They were outwardly in relation with David. But they must be examined. It is very serious, for there is a risk of danger: those who, by birth and education, have been amongst Christians all their life, might take their place without there having been a work in their heart.
-- The great question is: Have they received the Holy Spirit?
-- "And the spirit came upon Amasai, the chief of the captains, and he said, Thine are we, David, and with thee, thou son of Jesse: Peace, peace be to thee! And peace be to thy helpers! For thy God helps thee. And David received them, and made them chiefs of bands", @1 Chronicles 12:18.
-- That answers to @Romans 10:9: "If thou shalt
{14}
confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord, and shalt believe in thy heart that God has raised him from among the dead, thou shalt be saved".
-- No one can say, "Lord Jesus", except by the Holy Spirit.
-- That is of all importance. The great question there, is: "Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye had believed?" @Acts 19:2.
-- Are there some who might have faith, without having received the Holy Spirit?
-- If there is really faith in Christ, there is the Holy Spirit; but that is a matter to be looked into. It is said of Simon the magician that he believed Philip when he preached; but when Peter and John went down from Jerusalem, they discerned that there was nothing at all in him: "Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter, for thy heart is not upright before God" @Acts 8:21. His intelligence alone had been affected.
-- One who has received the Holy Spirit opens his mouth to praise.
-- He cries, "Abba, Father".
-- When we have received the Spirit and are under His control, we are not satisfied only to be Christ's, but we desire to be with Him and with those who are faithful, who wish to serve Him and are subject to Him. We read that the men of war "came with a perfect heart to Hebron" @1 Chronicles 12:38.
-- It says that the Spirit came upon Amasai, the chief of the captains. The demons believe and tremble, but the question is: Have you the true faith, and have you received the Holy Spirit? David tested them, for fear there was a traitor among them: "But if to betray me to mine enemies, seeing there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers see it and rebuke it" @1 Chronicles 12:17. And the Spirit answered by Amasai: "Thine are we, David, and with thee, thou
{15}
son of Jesse: Peace, peace be to thee! And peace, be to thy helpers! For thy God helps thee" @1 Chronicles 12:18. They do not seek to have importance and to take a place, but they recognise those who help David, so that David cannot do other than say to them: Come in! He could not leave them outside.
-- That shows the seriousness of the thing. That is why it says in @Romans 15:7, "to the glory of God".
-- "According as the Christ also has received you to the glory of God".
-- That is the reason why faithful doorkeepers are necessary.
-- Peter and John, at Samaria, are typically doorkeepers. They find that Simon the magician has no part in this matter; and they will not have his money. On the other hand, Ananias, knowing who Saul of Tarsus was, would have left him outside. If one is not in this spirit of the kingdom, in a kingly spirit, one may leave outside someone who might be very useful. A person who has faith and who acknowledges the lordship of Christ ought to be admitted into the circle; but it would be good to ask him: Why do you wish to be received? Mr. Stoney, when quite young, came to some old brethren, saying to them: I must be among you. But they were afraid, like Ananias, and said to him, Do you know what you wish to do? Have you faith, to take such a decision? He answered them, Faith or no faith, I must be among you! Then they said to him, Come in! He was evidently with them at heart.
-- When the two disciples came to the Lord Jesus, He did not receive them without asking them, "What seek ye?" "And they said to him, Rabbi, where abidest thou?" @John 1:38.
-- It is very blessed to see that the Lord has shown the way in which we are to receive others, to Peter in connection with Cornelius, to Ananias in connection
{16}
with Saul. If there is joy in heaven over one sinner that repents, there ought to be joy in the assembly for the same reason, glad as we are to be able to appreciate the work of God in a heart, and to receive the one in whom it is manifested.
Reading at St. Etienne, 1st May, 1926, afternoon.

INTELLIGENCE IN THE ASSEMBLY
@1 Corinthians 11:17 - 26; @Acts 1:1 - 5
-- The apostle addresses Christians, in the epistle to the Corinthians, as intelligent persons, in connection with the subject of the assembly. "I speak", he says, "as to intelligent persons: do ye judge what I say" @1 Corinthians 10:15. So that we see it is a matter of spiritual intelligence to understand the truth regarding the assembly. The Corinthians were lacking in spiritual intelligence -- the intelligence that accompanies spiritual growth. The apostle is obliged to address himself to these Corinthians "as to babes in Christ". Being in that defective state, they were not capable of laying hold of the depths and hidden wisdom of God. Consequently, the apostle laboured to lead them forward in their spiritual intelligence. He says to them, "In malice be babes; but in your minds be grown men" @1 Corinthians 14:20. And again, "Quit yourselves like men" (@1 Corinthians 16:13), that is to say, persons who have their senses exercised for distinguishing both good and evil.
It is said of Samuel that he "grew before Jehovah" @1 Samuel 2:21. His mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year. The coat of the past year could not serve for the following year. The child had developed. The first epistle to the Corinthians is like this little coat. It was made for them. They were very small, undeveloped; the apostle could not address them as grown men. In the second epistle, we see, so to speak, a larger coat. They had made progress, and they are clothed with more spiritual and deeper thoughts. It is said of Samuel that he "grew on, and was in favour both with Jehovah and also with men" (@1 Samuel 2:26); he continued to increase in stature. Then, when later
{18}
he began to speak for Jehovah, it is said that Jehovah "let none of his words fall to the ground" @1 Samuel 3:19. The words of grown men, fully developed, are to be kept; they are of value. On the other hand, the words of a Christian who is not developed fall to the ground and remain there. Many things which we say are quickly forgotten, even by us who say them; but when it is a question of a grown man, like Samuel, the Holy Spirit notes that none of his words fall to the ground.
With regard to the assembly, the Corinthians could not be praised. They did not assemble together as they should have done. They were no doubt accustomed to come together regularly in the same place; but it is not sufficient to come together. It is a matter of coming together "in assembly", and as thus coming together "in assembly" of knowing how the Lord's supper is to be taken with dignity.
-- What is the difference between *coming together* and *coming together in assembly*?
-- Coming together into one place does not necessarily mean coming together in assembly. To come together is one thing; to come together in assembly is another. To come together in assembly means that each one of those who come together thus is intelligent as to what the assembly means. For example, we have come together this evening, but we have not come together in assembly. In the gospel of Matthew, the disciples were taught of the Lord to discern what the assembly means. The Lord taught them that it was necessary to refuse carefully the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. The Pharisees and Sadducees came up and asked the Lord for a sign, but He answered them: "A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and a sign shall not be give to it save the sign of Jonas" (@Matthew 16:4), that is to say, that of death and resurrection. Then it is added that "He left them and went away".
{19}
Not merely that He left them, but He put a distance between Him and them. "He ... went away". Thus, there is a distance, a clean separation, between the Lord on the one hand, and the Pharisees and Sadducees on the other. But the Lord went away with His own to the other side. This voyage tested the disciples. They had forgotten to take bread with them. In the assembly what is suitable must not be forgotten. It is the place of spiritual activity and intelligence. The Lord said to them, "See and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees" @Matthew 16:6. That is to say that it is possible for us to leave them and to carry away their leaven with us. We may carry away the religious leaven of the flesh and of that fleshly intellect, that is to say, of infidels and of religious persons. It is perhaps in that that the brethren have suffered most from those who brought with them the leaven of associations. The disciples thought the Lord was speaking of bread; but in reality the Lord was speaking of what is spiritual. We have to learn and to speak spiritually in connection with the assembly. Then it says that "they comprehended" finally that He was not speaking to them of leaven in connection with bread, but in connection with the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees. The word *comprehend* is important; it is a matter of looking around to measure and take in the things relating to the assembly. There are two words: 'understand' (verse 11) and 'comprehend' (verse 12). "How do ye not understand that it was not concerning bread I said to you, Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees? Then they comprehended that he did not speak of being beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees" @Matthew 16:11. As an illustration, I can understand the thought of the universe, but I cannot comprehend it; for that is beyond my capacity. In approaching what concerns the assembly we must
{20}
examine everything, measure everything, weigh everything, in order to arrive at comprehending. When it is a question of a case of discipline, it is necessary to take account of all that characterises the man and what are his circumstances: it is necessary to understand and to comprehend.
In chapter 15 of the Acts, there was a conference concerning the nations; it was a question of knowing whether they must be put under the law. There were many discussions. The apostles and elders were gathered together to consider and examine the situation, and it was examined from all sides. Then, the apostles, the elders, and the whole assembly, arrived at a decision, and finally it says, "It has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us" (@Acts 15:28). We are therefore to be divinely instructed to take our place intelligently in the assembly and to act there in a suitable manner, according to the Lord. The assembly is something very great and nothing can be compared to it in the whole universe of God.
Now, in @Matthew 16:15, after having spoken of the leaven, the Lord puts this question to the disciples: "But ye, who do ye say that I am?" The question is not, What have you read and heard from the fathers? But, "Who do ye say that I am?". And Peter answers, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God" @Matthew 16:16. Peter did not learn that from the books he had read; he did not learn it from meetings; but it was a direct revelation from the Father. Thus, my place in the assembly means that I am in relation with God and that I profit by the revelation that He has made to me of His thoughts. And the Lord said to him, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona, for flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens. And I also, I say unto thee that *thou* art Peter, and on this rock I will build my assembly, and Hades¬ gates shall not prevail against it" @Matthew 16:17,18. Thus, Peter was like a
{21}
sample of the material that the Lord would use to build the assembly. "I ... on this rock, I will build"; the thought of the rock is expressed in Peter's confession, and it was the expression of the measure in which he had perceived and understood the Person of Christ.
In the first epistle to the Corinthians, the apostle labours to lead the Corinthians into these truths. They were "as babes" who were coming together in a human way. It is true that they came together regularly into one place, but there were sects among them, and the way they acted, their behaviour, caused the assembly to be despised. That is why he said, "When ye come therefore together into one place, it is not to eat the Lord's supper". They were not approaching this sacred memorial in an intelligent way, and the apostle recalls to them what he had received from the Lord Jesus and had communicated to them. He explains and unfolds to them the features and spiritual meaning of the Lord's supper. It is a question of approaching it with spiritual intelligence, as a spiritual memorial. It is the Lord's supper that opens the way by which the Lord can come in and take His place with His own. It is not merely coming together; it is much more. By means of the Supper, we recall the Lord in a living way to our remembrance.
-- In instituting it, the Lord Himself would maintain His place in the heart of His own.
-- So that these passages in @1 Corinthians 11 link up completely with the beginning of the Acts. We read in the Acts: "Being assembled with them, commanded them" (@Acts 1:4) -- Jesus "commanded them". The four evangelists do not use such expressions in their gospels. They do not say that the Lord assembled with His own. Luke, at the end of his gospel, relates that when the disciples were gathered together, the Lord stood in their midst. But he does not say in
{22}
the gospel, as he does in the Acts, that the Lord assembled with them: that is reserved for the Acts of which the object is to lead us into the assembly. The Lord would make His disciples understand how they could assemble after His resurrection. So it says, "Being assembled with them, (he) commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem" @Acts 1:4. He assembled with them in order to command. That is to give us to understand that He comes into the midst of His own to direct everything.
-- When it is a question of the Pharisees and Sadducees, He indicates the sign that will take place, and leaves them there. The death of Christ separates us from this world. Between His own on the one hand, and the Pharisees and Sadducees on the other, there is the death of Christ.
-- He assembled with them; that is very important because, if the Lord acted thus, He did it in order that His disciples might understand it, and come together, and act later in assembly.
-- The Lord assembles with His disciples during those forty days before leaving them. They depart the same day that they had seen Him go up into heaven, and gather in the upper chamber; Peter stands up with intelligence as to the Lord's commandments, and says, An apostle is missing; an apostle must be found; that apostle must have characteristic features. "It is necessary therefore, that of the men who have assembled with us all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day in which he was taken up from us, one of these should be a witness with us of his resurrection" @Acts 1:21,22. These verses show that Peter had laid hold intelligently of what the Lord had wished to teach them in assembling with them after His resurrection. Peter had acquired intelligence to know what needed to be done after the ascension of Christ while awaiting
{23}
the descent of the Holy Spirit, when the disciples were alone. When we are left alone, the test shows whether we have learnt what should be done at the moment when there is something to do. Peter answered to the test and said, There must be an apostle who has been among the witnesses from the beginning. Since the day of Pentecost the assembly is the great interest of God upon this earth; and He is working by His Spirit so that His children may be led into the understanding of what the assembly means, and that all may take and fill out their place in the assembly.
-- The Lord did not name the twelfth apostle, but left the care of doing this to His own.
-- Why was another necessary?
-- Because the number twelve speaks of administration according to the thought of God. You have twelve tribes, twelve apostles, twelve foundations.
God never gives up any of His thoughts. The Lord would have in each locality a vessel at His disposal, a local assembly which can function in testimony in a manner worthy of Him: "My assembly". He has here, at St. Etienne, His assembly, and He desires that His assembly may be in evidence, composed of all those who are intelligent so that He may use them in testimony as a vessel at His disposal. Thus, the epistle to the Corinthians is addressed "to the assembly of God which is in Corinth" @1 Corinthians 1:2.
-- To learn the mind of God, one must be in the assembly. It is impossible to know it if one is outside.
Reading with J.T. at St. Etienne, 1st May, 1926, evening.

THE GOSPEL: ITS PRESENTATION AND ITS BENEFITS
@2 Kings 5:1 - 4; @2 Kings 7:3 - 11
The second book of Kings presents to us typically the day in which we are found at present. In the first book, it is a question of men's responsibility. Elijah the prophet brings in the light of God with regard to the responsibility of King Ahab; that king had completely failed in his responsibility. Ahab allowed himself to be influenced by his wife Jezebel; @1 Kings 21:25. At the beginning of the second book of the Kings of Israel, Ahaziah falls down. All that is connected with man according to flesh cannot stand, but falls. There had been a great light in the house of Ahab, but Ahaziah, who had succeeded him, had not profited by the light that was found in his father's house. He fell down through the lattice in his upper chamber. Instead of turning to the God of Israel by whom the light had come into the house of his father, he turned to Baal-zebub. All that reminds us of the public history of the professing church. At the time of the Reformation, for example, God caused a great light to shine. But instead of profiting by the light that God had caused to shine, those who were at the head turned to deeper darkness than ever. So Ahaziah, instead of profiting by the light that had shone, turned to Baal-zebub. But then, if Ahaziah falls down and dies, the prophet by whose means the light of God had come to him, is translated and received into heaven. Elijah is received into the glory. The light which is presented to us, to us and to you, this afternoon, comes from heaven. It is not something that has come out of darkness, out of the minds of men; quite the contrary, it is the full light of heaven. Christ has
{25}
ascended; He has entered into the very heavens. Having entered into heaven, He has sent the Holy Spirit. Elisha typically represents the Holy Spirit. Sometimes he typifies the individual believer, sometimes he is a type of the Lord Himself; but, in general, he represents the service of grace of the Holy Spirit come down from heaven. So it was necessary that he should be in the company of Elijah before his translation. No one can rightly present Christ in glory without having been in His company. Elisha went with Elijah from Gilgal as far as the Jordan. He accompanied him to Bethel, to Jericho, and as far as the Jordan. The Lord, before sending His apostles, chose them that they might be with Him and accompany Him, and that at length He might send them to preach; but they were only sent after having been with Him. Consequently, the capacity for preaching is found in the fact that we have been in the company of Jesus. Elisha therefore, having accompanied Elijah from Gilgal as far as the Jordan, sees him go up into heaven and receives a double portion of his Spirit.
The gospel of God is presented to men in our day in the full power of the Holy Spirit. But, if it is a question of the blessing of men, there must be an entirely new beginning, as in the case of Elisha who returned thence to Jericho. The men of the city say to him, "Behold now, the situation of the city is good, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the land is barren", @2 Kings 2:19. The world indeed may have a very pleasant outward appearance, but the springs of refreshment are corrupted. In the world there is barrenness everywhere as regards the knowledge of God. So for each one of us, if it is a matter of receiving a blessing from God, there must be an absolutely new beginning. There must be a new cruse, and salt. "Bring me a new cruse", says Elisha, "and put salt in it" @2 Kings 2:20. The salt having been
{26}
thrown into the waters, they are purified. So that now, thanks to the death of Christ and the gift of the Spirit, there is a fresh and pure spring down here.
I wish to bring out, from the two passages I have read, what kind of vessel God uses for His gospel. It is not a question of persons who have importance or prestige in the religious world. First it speaks of a little captive maid. She is a lady's maid-servant; she has no religious position; she is of no account in human society; there is nothing to commend her to the natural man. However, it is this little maid whom God is going to use to announce the gospel to Naaman. She is typically the result of the teaching of the previous chapter. In chapter 4 we find a woman who was in debt. The prophet asks what she had in the house: she had only a pot of oil. She represents believers who do not understand the value of the Holy Spirit. The prophet tells her to sell the oil, pay her debts and live "on the rest".
Then, we find "a wealthy woman". We are really wealthy or great, only in so far as we recognise the Holy Spirit. The greatest power that exists in the universe dwells in the Christian, and the wealth of heaven is in our souls. This woman, this Shunammite, is called "a wealthy woman". There was, with her, consideration for Christ. She prepared in her house a chamber for the prophet. Chapter 4 contains many other things that we have not time to consider. Typically, the teaching of chapter 4 involves the epistles to the Romans, Colossians and Ephesians. The believer is established in all the light and wealth of heaven. Such a believer has no need of any importance in the religious world; he does not need permission to preach the gospel. He is infinitely richer inwardly than he is outwardly. He does not seek public reputation. He is content to be nothing, as the apostle Paul says, in @1 Corinthians 4:13, "As the offscouring of the world, the refuse
{27}
of all". In the light of the epistle to the Ephesians which shines in his soul, he is content to be nothing and to bear reproach. The soul of such a believer is filled with the consciousness of the wealth of heaven. Knowing Christ in heaven, his thought is to make known what he knows, as Paul says, "We do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus Lord, and ourselves your bondmen for Jesus¬ sake" @2 Corinthians 4:5. So, this little maid is a captive, but she has more light in her soul than all the Syrians, and this light marks her peculiarly. She speaks with conviction and emotion. She says to her mistress, "Oh, would that my lord were before the prophet that is in Samaria! then he would cure him of his leprosy". She had no doubt in her mind. And we who believe in the Lord and know Him, know what we are saying. We have experienced His power to heal, and thus we present Him to you. "Neither is there another name under heaven which is given among men by which we must be saved", @Acts 4:12. The gospel presented by this little maid is the Person of Christ. The four lepers in chapter 7 present rather the benefits resulting from the gospel. It speaks of them in detail in the epistle to the Romans. It is the gospel concerning a Person, "His Son". In Ephesians, it is a question of the unsearchable riches of the Christ, but the little maid preached the Person Himself. And then, let us observe well that this little maid was completely delivered from all national feeling. The Syrians ruled over Israel. Indeed they had brought this little maid away captive. She was a captive in the country of the Syrians; but she bore them no malice. And the Christian has no ill-will against those who may belong to other nations. There is only one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus. So that the Christian is not concerned with national or international questions; he is only concerned about the souls of men. He sees that God
{28}
desires at all cost to reach the souls of men. It is God who "desires that all men should be saved" @1 Timothy 2:4. So that the believer, of whom this little maid is a type, is completely delivered from all national and international feelings. The little maid was occupied with the state in which her master was found, although he was the Syrian captain. It is precious and interesting to see that, in the end, Naaman had to act according to the word of this little maid. The king of Syria had sent this captain to the king of Israel. The little maid had nothing to say about the king of Israel, who had no power and could do nothing. So Naaman had to go to the house of the man whom the little maid had presented. He had to go to Elisha's house. As he arrives at Elisha's door, the prophet sends him a message, "Go, and wash in the Jordan seven times" @2 Kings 5:10. There is no salvation unless we submit ourselves to the word. Men may make all kinds of suggestions, but they are only hindrances; the king of Syria only delayed the healing of Naaman, in sending him to the king of Israel. There is no salvation, save in Christ alone; outside of Him, it is absolutely impossible to be saved. It is absolutely necessary to be subject to His word. The message from the prophet to Naaman was: "Go, and wash in the Jordan seven times". In other words, it is faith in the Lord Jesus, faith in the efficacy of His precious work. "The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin" @1 John 1:7.
Now the four lepers of chapter 7 represent other features of the gospel. These four lepers are chosen very particularly to give us to see and understand the kind of instrument God uses in our days. "Four leprous men". They had no place at all within the city, neither had they any at all among the Syrians. They had nothing before them but death. Therefore, driven by deep necessity, they went into the camp of the Syrians and they found themselves in a place of
{29}
abundance. Are they not types of us, Christians? We were without hope and without God in the world, so that in the dusk and in deep need, we turned toward the place where there is abundance. At first we had no idea of the wealth of that place. When we turned our eyes in the right direction, then God acted on our behalf; He made a great fear fall upon the Syrians. They fled, leaving everything behind them. The poor lepers, entering the camp of the Syrians, found abundance and appropriated that abundance; that is just what we believers have done. We appropriated the abundant riches; then our hearts have been won and secured. That is what we feel we must tell you! It is not a question of official dignity; but being loaded with the abounding wealth of the place where we are, and knowing your needs, since you have not yet come in, we have the privilege this afternoon of drawing near to you to testify to the place where abundance is found.
The city was besieged; the population were in deep need of food, and they had nothing. The people were dying of hunger. But perhaps you have not a deep need. What is your outlook? Nothing but death, and after death, judgment. Will you not then receive with joy this precious provision of the grace of God which is for you also? We have the privilege of being able to speak of it to you. We have appropriated these precious realities. We have visited the camp of the Syrians, and we can speak with certainty. What are you going to do with these glad tidings? Are there any here of whom it can be said that they receive not the love of the truth that they may be saved? The captain of the army of Israel on whom the king leaned did not believe these tidings. He said that God would have to open the windows of the heavens; but why should He not open them? It is exactly what He has done, for at Pentecost the Holy Spirit came down from heaven and brought with
{30}
Him all the wealth of heaven for men. You must not do as this unbelieving captain who reasoned. Do you not believe that God has given His beloved Son men and that He has also given His Holy Spirit?
If you do not accept what God presents to you, you will be in the category of those who "have not received the love of the truth that they might be saved" (@2 Thessalonians 2:10) and then you will only meet judgment. It says, "For this reason God sends to them a working of error, that they should believe what is false, that all might be judged who have not believed the truth" @2 Thessalonians 2:11. To-day, it is the moment to receive the truth, to learn to love it. We have this double testimony that of the little maid who presented the person of Elisha, and that of the four leprous men who bore witness of the abundant wealth that there is for all men. The number 'four' indicates what is general, that is to say that their testimony can be found in all believers. The testimony that characterises all believers is that they enjoy this great abundance; they know it; it is at the disposal of all men in the power of the Holy Spirit who is upon earth.
God grant that those who have not availed themselves of this rich grace may do so today!
The Lord's word is this: "Repent and believe in the glad tidings" @Mark 1:15. On the day of Pentecost, Peter said, "Repent, and be baptised, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" @Acts 2:38.

{31}
THE CIRCLE OF THE BRETHREN
@Malachi 1:1 - 5; @1 John 3:13 - 16
-- How God loves those in whom the brotherly spirit is found! Malachi speaks right at the end of a dispensation. He looks back and alludes to what was past. He draws Israel's attention to the love that God had for Jacob, for it is in the family of Jacob that the brotherly spirit manifested itself. He alludes to Esau with whom the brotherly spirit was not seen. He was Jacob's brother, but what had characterised him was hatred for his brother. Therefore God says, "I loved Jacob, and I hated Esau". The Old Testament is full of examples showing how Esau failed with regard to this brotherly spirit, and this prophetic testimony which is presented to us right at the end of the dispensation, shows us how God hates those who are marked by the lack of this brotherly spirit.
We are likewise at the end of a dispensation. We also are allowed to look back, to take account and discern where this brotherly spirit has manifested itself and where it has not manifested itself. Many Christians who bear the name of brethren do not manifest this brotherly spirit; there are even some in whom it is lacking. John speaks of these two categories: one shows itself in the case of Abel; the other, in the case of Cain. And John puts us on our guard against hating the brethren. He expresses himself most severely and says to us that "Every one that hates his brother is a murderer"; while those who are truly brethren are known as those who love one another. "We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren". Esau and Jacob started off, so to speak, together as brethren, and in the days that followed God carefully preserved the rights of Esau as the brother of Jacob.
{32}
But Esau failed completely as to the manifestation of the brotherly spirit. He would not allow his brother Jacob to place the sole of his foot on his territory. Israel said to him, "Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country; we will not pass through fields, or through vineyards, neither will we drink water out of the wells: we will go by the king's road; we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy border ... . We will go by the high way; and if we drink of thy water, I and my cattle, then I will pay for it", @Numbers 20:17 - 19. But Esau did not allow his brother to pass through his territory. Where then is the love of God in Esau? We are at the end of a dispensation, as Malachi was at the end of another dispensation, and that which is particularly pleasing to God at the end is love amongst brethren. Malachi warns us that if this spirit of brotherly love is lacking with us, we shall be the objects of the hatred of Jehovah: "I hated Esau", He says.
It is very striking that that is said with regard to Esau at the end of a dispensation, as it is again spoken of for us who are at the end of the present dispensation.
It is a question of what is the result of a prolonged exercise. If God gives light, His object is that that light should produce exercise. If the result is according to Him, that is acceptable to Him, but He hates the opposite. Thus, light was given at the Reformation. The result was acceptable to God; but those who would not accept the light that shone at the Reformation plunged themselves still further into darkness. And also, more recently, there has been a recovery: God has added light to that which He had given at the Reformation. The circle of the brethren has come to light. Many of those who came into that circle during a certain time, afterwards abandoned it. God looks for the full result of the exercise, as is seen in Enoch who was the seventh from Adam, the number seven speaking of the
{33}
complete exercise. I believe that we are at the end of this exercise. God is giving His own the inward testimony of His approval. Enoch, before his translation, had received the testimony of having pleased God. The Lord says to the overcomer at Philadelphia "that no one take thy crown" @Revelation 3:11. Our glory is that the brotherly spirit is in evidence among us. So that the Lord Himself inaugurated the present dispensation with these words: "Go to my brethren" @John 20:17. For Him, these words are as fresh today as the day when He pronounced them. There are two thoughts, 'brethren' and 'the assembly', terms known and used publicly. They have taken their place in the vocabulary of popular religion, and thus they have necessarily lost their true meaning. We have therefore to learn afresh the meaning of these terms 'brethren' and 'the assembly'. No one would ever be able to learn the truth as to the assembly by the study of a dictionary, neither can the dictionary ever teach us what the word 'brethren' means in its true sense, according to the Lord's mind. The fact is that the expressions, the true scriptural terms, have lost their real meaning, because they have passed into the popular religious vocabulary. We must therefore go to the Lord Himself to learn their true meaning, as Elisha had to learn from Elijah the meaning of Gilgal, of Bethel, of Jericho and of the Jordan. These places had a spiritual meaning; but it had been lost, so that it was necessary to learn again what those names meant. So, if we want to understand what 'the brethren' really are, we must appeal to the Lord and be taught by Him. He says, "Go to my brethren" @John 20:17. The great truth, the pre-eminent thought in regard of the brethren, comes out in Jacob's family. And although Jacob's twelve sons were begotten by one and the same father, they had four different mothers. And of these four mothers, two were only maid-servants. The twelve sons of Jacob had to
{34}
learn the true meaning of the expression, "Joseph's brethren".
Joseph is a type of the Lord Jesus. It says that he was loved of his father. God is the Source of love. The Lord Jesus brings divine love to us and teaches us to behave as brethren. There are true Christians in all the sects and denominations in Christendom today; they all have one and the same Father, but they have various mothers, which explains why they do not understand the true character of the brethren. The expression 'mother' refers to the religious system in which I have been brought up. It is from our mother that we have our character. Gideon said, speaking of his brethren, that they were the sons of his mother; and they all resembled him: "As thou art, so were they" @Judges 8:18. Then he said, "They were my brethren, the sons of my mother" @Judges 8:19. It is an allusion to the assembly. In the measure in which we walk in the light of the assembly we are characterised by that which marks brethren according to God. It says of Jerusalem above that she is "free, which is our mother" @Galatians 4:26. None of the religious systems is free, and none of them is 'above', but the assembly belongs to heaven, so that the believer is heavenly in nature and in character, on the side of his Father and also on the side of his mother.
-- The mother of true believers is Jerusalem above -- "our mother".
-- The mothers represent all the endless denominations of Christendom where there is only one Father, but all sorts of mothers.
-- On this ground of love and the brotherly spirit, we reach what God proposed at the beginning; we reach it at the end of the present dispensation. Might it not be that there is someone here who would neglect the thought of God, in the last days of this dispensation? "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!" @Psalm 133:1.
{35}
That is the last but one of the Songs of Degrees. And the last song is a song of praise: "Behold, bless Jehovah" @Psalm 134:1. The end in view in the Songs of Degrees is that we all arrive at unity, as brethren. Jerusalem will be the joy of the whole earth; and it is there that brethren will dwell together in unity, "As the dew of Hermon that descendeth on the mountains of Zion; for there hath Jehovah commanded the blessing, life for evermore" @Psalm 133:3. The first allusion in this Psalm is to Christ Himself -- Aaron -- and the oil is poured on Aaron's head, on his beard, and on the hem of his garments, that is to say, on His own. "The dew of Hermon" is the heavenly refreshment that comes down upon the saints here below. "The mountains of Zion", that is the purpose of God, where He has commanded the blessing, life for evermore. In the first epistle of John, we *see* and we *know*. "We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren". The love of the brethren is the proof of life.
-- That is the blessing, eternal life.
-- Here, we have the things that we know, from John. The brethren properly speaking know things; they not only think them or hope them, but they know them.
-- We ought to test ourselves, to see if we love the brethren as such.
-- There are many believers who are far from *knowing*. A characteristic feature of the first epistle of John is to introduce us into the certainty and assurance of things. It says frequently, "We know".
-- According to John, there is nothing between the two circles; there is the circle of hatred and that of love, the circle of Cain and that of the brethren.
-- Is it permissible to put the question to those who are distressed, not being sure of anything: Do you love the brethren? If they have truly passed from
{36}
death to life, they will have affection for the brethren.
-- It is a characteristic feature of one who is truly a brother. He loves the brethren.
-- It must not be lost sight of that the expression 'brethren' includes the whole company; but the divisions are due to there being many 'mothers', although there is only one Father.
-- The religious systems are the different 'mothers'. We have numberless brethren in the various systems of Christendom, but as they have all kinds of mothers (all kinds of characters), it follows that the characters are not in harmony with the character of God, and fellowship is not possible. Thus, the Galatians were going back to the legal system, and consequently were in danger of being without light in their midst. They were going back to the old mother -- the law. John has before him a circle in which love is in activity down here. He says, "Do not wonder, brethren, if the world hate you". He addresses the brethren. He looks upon the brethren as those who have the same Father and the same mother, Jerusalem above. That is liberty. The evidence of life is that we love the brethren. We have passed from death to life. God has begotten us, and we love the brethren. That cannot be arrived at by human efforts. So that in that circle we breathe the atmosphere of life. It is the atmosphere of Hermon -- a blessed atmosphere.
-- Eternal life.
-- A brother from the Haute-Loire, after a very encouraging reading, once said: It is like the dew of Hermon. He was happy; he was refreshed.
-- There are two thoughts, that of heavenly refreshment, and also that of the dignity that goes with the anointing, the dignity of having been anointed with the oil of gladness. So that, although outwardly we may be hated and despised, nevertheless there is inwardly this enjoyment of the heavenly atmosphere.
{37}
It says, "Hereby we have known love, because he has laid down his life for us". It is there that we see love. We have learnt the love of Christ; it is He who has taught love. Generally, this would not be understood, nor even admitted; love can only be learnt from Christ, being taught of Him. Then he adds emphatically: "We ought for the brethren to lay down our lives". The secret of maintaining this brotherly love is the individual decision to lay down one's life "for the brethren". In the epistle to the Romans, it speaks of dying for a righteous man, for a good man; but in the first epistle of John the great question is laying down one's life for the brethren. God has the brethren in His thoughts and in His heart, and we are coming to have in our hearts the same thoughts and the same circle, which is not limited to the millennial kingdom, but goes on into eternity. At the moment when the Lord was about to ascend to heaven, He sent the message to His own as being His brethren: "Go to my brethren" @John 20:17. That is what pleases Him, and He is working at the present time in us to produce that which is agreeable to Him, and what is agreeable to Him will finally be translated to heaven like Enoch. In Hebrews, it is said of Enoch that he has the testimony that he had pleased God, but in Jude we find that he was a prophet. Those who please God will have the mind of God and will be able to express it; such are prophets. He says "Behold, the Lord has come amidst his holy myriads" @Jude 1:14. He was surrounded by corruption: his sole companion was God. So that in contrast with the frightful corruption that surrounded him on all sides, he saw the Lord coming amidst His holy myriads. That is what the Lord showed him. The Revelation really belongs to the brethren. "I John, your brother and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and patience, in Jesus" @Revelation 1:9.
-- Philadelphia means 'brotherly love'.

-- What we have seen this evening is what pleases God, what is agreeable to Him. It is the circle of the brethren where His mind is disclosed; it is known to them. It was the same at the end of the previous dispensation: "I loved Jacob, and I hated Esau". The divine hatred will be manifested later. He speaks of Esau, and says, "I hated Esau; and made his mountains a desolation, and gave his inheritance to the jackals of the wilderness. If Edom say, We are broken down but we will build again the ruined places -- thus saith Jehovah of hosts: They shall build, but I will throw down; and men shall call them the territory of wickedness, and the people against whom Jehovah hath indignation for ever". God is entirely opposed to all that is not of the brotherly spirit. The severest judgment will fall upon the whole of Christendom. In the Revelation, that is all unfolded in detail. The great dark religious system with which we are surrounded is very specially in view in the Revelation. They may build and construct, but God will overturn all that they construct, and that for ever. "And your eyes shall see it, and ye shall say, Jehovah is magnified beyond the border of Israel". The Lord says to the overcomer at Philadelphia: "Behold, I make them of the synagogue of Satan who say they are Jews, and are not, but lie; behold, I will cause that they shall come and shall do homage before thy feet, and shall know that I have loved thee" @Revelation 3:9.

MUTUALITY IN CONTRAST WITH CLERICALISM
@Matthew 23:8 - 12; @Matthew 26:20
-- The end in view in the gospel of Matthew is to form us, as believers, in view of the assembly, and a feature that we find particularly in Matthew is mutuality. Mutuality does not accord with clericalism. The Lord gives formal instructions to His disciples that they were not to allow themselves to be called 'Rabbi'. That does not mean that there should not be teachers among the saints; thus, Ephesians 4 speaks of the gift of "teacher", but the Lord insists that the disciples should not be recognised officially as 'Rabbi', for, He says, "one is your instructor, the Christ". "and all *ye* are brethren". He alone has the right to take the place officially as 'Instructor'; then, He adds: "All *ye* are brethren". The place of "brethren" is greater than every official position. All that is official will pass away, but the relation of brethren will continue eternally. This relation involves the family; and however distinguished a brother may be as being an elder, or as having a gift, he always comes back to his place in the family. The Levites were all first-born. Each Levite occupied the place of a first-born, and the epistle to the Hebrews teaches us that we belong "to the assembly of the first born who are registered in heaven" @Hebrews 12:23. This knowledge in our souls sets us free from all that is official; if sometimes we have to take a prominent place in service, we revert afterwards to the place of brethren in the family; we shall then have no desire to be called guides or instructors, or yet to be known as fathers. The Lord says, "Call not any one your father upon the earth; for one is your Father, he who is in the heavens".
{40}
But that does not mean that we may not exercise a fatherly influence among the saints. Paul speaks of himself as "the aged", and of Timothy as his son, his child. He says to the Corinthians: "If ye should have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the glad tidings", (@1 Corinthians 4:15) but he would not have allowed himself to be called 'father', although he was their spiritual father. The apostle John also speaks to his children. It is good that an advanced brother should exercise a fatherly influence among the saints; it is of great importance to them; but that advanced brother always remains a brother, forming a part of those of whom the Lord speaks when He says, "All *ye* are brethren", and that for ever. The thoughts of 'fathers', 'young men', 'little children' belong to the present period; but the relation of 'brethren' -- "all ye are brethren" -- will subsist eternally. When the Lord was about to ascend to heaven, He spoke of the disciples as being His brethren -- "Go to my brethren" @John 20:17. The thought is that He is to be "firstborn among many brethren" @Romans 8:29.
-- "But the greatest of you shall be your servant".
-- To lay stress on those words, the Lord adds: "And whoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled". A gift or devotedness or love may afford a brother a place of distinction, but this distinction only has value if it is laid at the Lord's feet. In Revelation 4, the elders cast their crowns before the throne. He who has the highest place is ready to take the lowest. If I profess to be a devoted or distinguished servant, I ought to show it by being the servant of the saints. Paul says, "We do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus Lord, and ourselves your bondmen for Jesus¬ sake", (@2 Corinthians 4:5) and later on, "all things are for your sakes" @2 Corinthians 4:15. He was gifted and fitted to serve the saints; he was in that way the property of all. The greatest among us ought to show a moral superiority in being ready to
{41}
wash the feet of the disciples. That is what is very clearly taught in the verses which we have read. We must accept these principles, if we wish to have part in the assembly of God. The thought is that where the disciples are, there is to be a vessel for God's use, and that each believer is to be found in his place in that vessel.
-- The first epistle to the Corinthians gives certain enlightenment on this subject. There is the thought of the temple, that of the assembly, and that of the body. Would you say a few words on these three thoughts?
-- In connection with the temple, we have light in the locality; in connection with the body, we have the expression of Christ in the locality. It was essential that each saint at Corinth should be in his place in the assembly.
-- It is much more to be a brother than to have one of the most distinguished gifts; the relation of brethren will abide during eternity, while the gifts will pass away.
-- To each one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. The most obscure member does his service, and it would be a mistake for him to take the place of an official servant; each saint is a servant. All the Levites, from a month old and upward, were numbered. No doubt there are special services attaching to the gifts; but in principle, every saint is a servant.
-- Naturally, the most precious thing is to be simply a brother.
-- "And ourselves your bondmen for Jesus¬ sake" @2 Corinthians 4:5.
-- In chapter 16 of Matthew, the Lord leaves the Pharisees and Sadducees. "And he left them and went away" @Matthew 16:4. The disciples also had followed the Lord to the side opposite to that of the Pharisees and Sadducees. But they had forgotten to take bread. The Lord takes the opportunity of saying to
{42}
them: "See and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees" @Matthew 16:6. Although having taken a direction opposed to that of the Pharisees and Sadducees, we might carry away the leaven with us; having left the position itself, we might have kept with us the leaven of the system, when we should be preserving intact the precious relation of brethren.
-- In chapter 26, we see how this relation is preserved. "And when the evening was come he lay down at table with the twelve. And as they were eating he said, Verily I say to you, that one of you shall deliver me up" @Matthew 26:21. They were all at table with Him; they were all eating the same thing, and it is while they were eating that the Lord submits them to a test, and this test applies to all. He says, "I say to you, that one of you shall deliver me up" @Matthew 26:21. It is not to draw attention to Judas, to his guilt, but to show that they were all eating the same thing. He does not address Peter or John separately, but all together; they all had the same feeling at that moment. They were all eating the same thing, and it is then that He puts them to the test. It is a wholesome test for our souls, when the light of the Lord is shed on us all.
Now, the Lord puts the Supper before them, and we have here the thought of mutuality, so as to be searched all together. We are all tested and we discern that we have each one the tendency to do the same evil act. That preserves us from being hard toward our brethren. I cannot be hard toward others; I cannot act as a Pharisee. Without the grace of the Lord, I should be as guilty as he who committed the evil deed -- how this thought humbles me! -- I cannot act in a priestly way towards others. The apostle says to the Galatians: "Ye who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, considering thyself lest *thou* also be tempted" @Galatians 6:1. When Peter puts the question to the Lord, "Lord, how
{43}
often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? until seven times?" (@Matthew 18:21) the Lord answers him: "I say not to thee until seven times, but until seventy times seven" @Matthew 18:22. If one among us sins, he is none the less a brother, and the brother should be saved: "Go, reprove him between thee and him alone" @Matthew 18:15. Not a single brother must be lost, for he is of too much value. It is for the weak brother that Christ died; @1 Corinthians 8:11.
In verse 26 it says, "And as they were eating" @Matthew 26:26. If the saints do not eat, there is no hope of their making progress. The Lord's supper should remind us that we should be eating continually; the test of which we have spoken is that mentioned in 1 Corinthians 5: "Let us celebrate the feast ... with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth" @1 Corinthians 5:8. It is a feast which lasts seven days. The subject is eating; those who were eating are spoken of twice when the Lord introduced the Supper in Matthew 26 (in verses 21 and 26). They were eating the passover. In 1 Corinthians 5, the feast is to be celebrated with unleavened bread. There is a distinction between the passover and the feast of unleavened bread. Our Passover is Christ. Our Passover has been sacrificed. The unleavened bread represents what we provide ourselves; we provide it in the sense that we are maintained in a certain state of soul involving self-judgment; it is a daily exercise. If we provide unleavened bread, we can partake of the feast with enjoyment; if these conditions are fulfilled in the locality, the feast of the Lord will be well understood.
It says, "Take, eat". In Luke it does not speak of eating. In Matthew it is a question of forming a spiritual condition in believers, so that they might take their place in the assembly with intelligence and enjoyment; that is Matthew's point of view. What is needed is the reality of life and enjoyment of the thing. "In malice be babes; but in your minds be
{44}
grown men" @1 Corinthians 14:20. The passover is connected with the old system; something new is now introduced, and before setting aside what was old, all the light of the old economy is presented in its fulness. In the old system, all that God was for Israel was included; and this is what is presented before the introduction of the new order. The Lord gives them another cup: the cup of the new covenant in His blood poured out for them. What God had been for Israel is set aside until the millennium; all will be taken up again in the future. The disciples were to drink of the cup. So we have the Lord's supper, which is more than the passover. The Lord said, "Take, eat: this is my body", (@Matthew 26:26) and later, "Drink ye all of it" @Matthew 26:27. They were all to do it, all the disciples. That supposes no clerical idea; it is simply a thought of mutuality.
In chapter 20 of the Acts, several brethren met together: Paul, Timothy and other distinguished brethren. It says, "We being assembled to break bread" @Acts 20:7. The principle is: "We being assembled". After having each performed a different service, they all come back to this blessed experience which puts them on a footing of equality; all are on the same level; all are brethren. It is mutuality, and not clericalism. In chapter 4 of the Acts, Peter and John, after having been distinguished in service and sufferings, and having been let go, went to join their own company; they formed part of it. "Having been let go, they came to their own company" @Acts 4:23. If the apostles are mentioned, they are mentioned together; but when they arrive in the company all identity is lost; all is levelled; all are known as brethren. Afterwards, each may return to his service, but at the Lord's supper, each has his place as a brother.
-- It is a comfort and a joy, to the heart of those who are in service, to sit down with others as brethren, in rest and peace, to be occupied with Christ, and
{45}
not with service. The most distinguished brother rejoices when the weakest expresses a few words of thanksgiving, though he may only pronounce five words. The weakest and the most advanced have both received the Spirit of liberty, quite as much as the apostle Paul; and all cry, Abba, Father. Why not appropriate these things?
-- It must not be forgotten that in Acts 20 there were distinguished brethren and local brethren. Paul was there to rejoice with the others. They were gathered together "to break bread". There was no president. The principle which characterises this passage is: "We being assembled". Paul discoursed; one may give an address, after worship, but there are no directions for that.
-- In 1 Corinthians 15, it says that the Lord was seen by "Above five hundred brethren at once", (@1 Corinthians 15:6) but it does not speak of distinguished brethren.
-- Through Paul, we have the Lord's supper. As a result, the whole company is led into the heavenly regions.

PRIESTLY STATE
@Malachi 1:1,2; @Malachi 2:4 - 6; @Malachi 4:4 - 6; @Malachi 3:16
-- The book of Malachi is well placed at the end of the Old Testament. The passages we have read lead us back. The object of the Spirit of God is that the light of the beginning of a dispensation may be found again at the end. Thus, the love of God for His people from the beginning, and what the priesthood was (that is to say the light of the whole dispensation) shine at the end. It is said to them to remember the law of Moses commanded from the beginning. At the same time, we have the promises which incite us to a corresponding expectancy and preparation, for the close of one economy opens the way to another economy, that close being in connection with the dispensation which is to come. That is what the position of the saints in our day answers to. The light given to govern the whole position governs our position, and then we have the promises. That is what we find in the epistle to the assembly of Philadelphia.
At the beginning of chapter 3 of Malachi, we read these words: "Behold I send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me" @Malachi 3:1. Then it says, "And the Lord whom ye seek will suddenly come to his temple" @Malachi 3:1. The remnant would then be in expectancy and in that state of preparation. And in the last chapter it says, "Behold, I send unto you Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and terrible day of Jehovah. And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers". These promises call forth expectancy and preparation for the coming of the Lord. The full light of the beginning is given to us now.
{47}
The first important feature is the love of God: "I loved Jacob"; then, a solemn warning is given to all those who occupy the position of brethren but who have not the spirit of brethren: "I hated Esau" @Malachi 1:3. Chapter 2 is addressed to the priests. There cannot be anything for God if the priestly spirit is lacking with the saints. We have to take account of what the priesthood was at the outset, and it is not to be altered in any wise today. Peter in speaking to the saints says that they are "a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ" @1 Peter 2:5. That is the reason for which the priesthood was established at the outset; and it has not been modified at all. So Jehovah draws attention to Levi (@Malachi 2:5 - 7): "My covenant with him was of life and peace, and I gave them to him that he might fear; and he feared me, and trembled before my name. The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity. For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and at his mouth they seek the law; for he is the messenger of Jehovah of hosts". In the priesthood is seen all that God possessed; and what He possessed then is what He seeks now. The thought regarding the priesthood is continued in the saints. Let us then be true Levites. The law of truth was in Levi's mouth, "he turned many from iniquity" @Malachi 2:6.
-- All these features should be manifested in us.
-- The expression 'priesthood' does not belong to any system; it belongs to believers who have the Holy Spirit, as much to sisters as to brothers. Those who were waiting for the coming of the Lord Jesus were true priests. Anna "did not depart from the temple, serving night and day with fastings and prayers" (@Luke 2:37); she "gave praise to the Lord, and spoke of him to all those who waited for redemption in
{48}
Jerusalem" @Luke 2:38. Simeon also was a true priest. "The Holy Spirit was upon him. And it was divinely communicated to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death before he should see the Lord's Christ. And he came in the Spirit into the temple" @Luke 2:26,27. In the gospel of Luke we have these two characters of priesthood, and both are also in view in Malachi. There were others, but these two serve to testify to what is desired.
-- This second chapter is very solemn for us; it begins with these words: "And now, ye priests, this commandment is for you" @Malachi 2:1.
-- Now, it is not a question only of the tribe of Levi, but, what is quite new, the whole company is a company of priests. All form part of the priestly family and draw near to God under the direction of the High Priest, the true Aaron. God looks for these things among us; for the Old Testament is of interest in that it was written for us. It is to be noticed that, in the book of Malachi, the prophet draws attention to the thought of a remnant. At the end of chapter 3 we find this remnant: "They that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another" @Malachi 3:16. What characterised the rest of the people was that they were not honouring God. "If then I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith Jehovah of hosts unto you, priests, that despise my name" @Malachi 1:6. Polluted bread was presented on the altar; a blind, lame or sick beast was offered as a sacrifice. The table of Jehovah was despised; and God said, "I have no delight in you ... . neither will I accept an oblation at your hand" @Malachi 1:10. Attention is drawn to their indifference and negligence. Might not this spirit be shown even with those who break bread? Is it not the case that there is indifference as to the privileges of the assembly? Do we not sometimes forsake the assembling of ourselves together? A lack of energy is shown, and there is no fruit. God takes
{49}
account of all these things, and the solemn word is addressed to the priests. In chapter 2, verse 9, because they had had contempt for God, God had made them contemptible. Then it says, "The Lord ... will suddenly come to his temple" @Malachi 3:1. There is a great principle which must be noted: God expects that His own, in the last days, will put the truth into practice as it was at the beginning. God says, "Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, the statutes and ordinances". It was for all Israel, and from the beginning. There are no modifications in these principles; they have to be learned as they were at the outset. 'Horeb' is the mountain spoken of in Deuteronomy and is connected with the spiritual bearing of the covenant. 'Sinai' is the fear of Jehovah, the law filling with fear men who cannot answer to its commandments.
-- The law commanded by Moses was "the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob" @Deuteronomy 33:4.
-- The first commandment, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy understanding", is, in @Matthew 22:37, a quotation from Deuteronomy in connection with Horeb. The second commandment, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself", (@Matthew 22:39) is like the first. The Lord Jesus had a deep appreciation of the law of God; He held it hidden in His heart. Such an appreciation of the law of God in connection with Horeb answers to the love of God which is spoken of at the beginning of the book of Malachi.
-- All is the product of the love of God. In Romans 8, the righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled in us who do not walk according to flesh but according to Spirit. "His commandments are not grievous" @1 John 5:3.
-- In connection with the righteous requirement of the law, we have what is said in @Deuteronomy 10:12,13:
{50}
"What doth Jehovah thy God require of thee, but to fear Jehovah thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul, to keep the commandments of Jehovah, and his statutes, which I command thee this day, for thy good?"
-- "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy understanding. This is the great and first commandment. And the second is like it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments the whole law and the prophets hang" @Matthew 22:40.
-- The apostle Paul said to the Corinthians, "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment" @1 Corinthians 14:37. Those who love the Lord regard the epistles to the Corinthians as the "inheritance of the congregation of Jacob" @Deuteronomy 33:4. In Deuteronomy 33, Moses commanded a law; if one had asked the people what they thought of it, they would have said, No other nation has a law like ours. Their heart was won.
-- There is a remnant whom the Lord approves; that remnant bears the character of the priesthood. It is said of Levi that he feared Jehovah. In chapter 3 of Malachi, they that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another. Fear is one of the characteristic marks of the priesthood. If God works in the heart of a believer, he is awakened to the iniquity of the system in which he is found. "And he feared me, and trembled before my name". You remember what Josiah did, when they brought him the book of the law found in the house of Jehovah. "And it came to pass when the king heard the words of the law, that he rent his garments" (@2 Chronicles 34:19), seeing that the words of the book had not been observed. So in our days, the characteristic feature of the priesthood is the fear of God; and as a result, the
{51}
one who fears the name of the Lord and who calls upon Him, withdraws from iniquity; he *flees* youthful lusts, and *pursues* "righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart" @2 Timothy 2:22. The thought of the priesthood is developed in the second epistle to Timothy. The spirit of a priest abhors the religious anomaly which is current today. To take a place intelligently in the priesthood, one must separate from iniquity. "They that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another" @Malachi 3:16. The true priests are coming to light today; they often speak one to another; they fear the Lord.
The priest relies upon the principles of Scripture, "and at his mouth they seek the law; for he is the messenger of Jehovah of hosts" @Malachi 2:7. There are perhaps among these priests persons of small account in the world; but they have the Spirit of God. Of Levi, it is said, "He feared me, and trembled before my name. The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity". That is a person who walks with God.
-- These things are written for priests.
-- To be a priest is more than being a believer; a priest has taken his place of privilege, having identified himself with the only and true Priest. And the priest turns "many from iniquity".
-- And these persons shine like stars in the middle of the night, when the moon (the church) is no longer in evidence.
-- The Lord said, "Rejoice that your names are written in the heavens" @Luke 10:20.
-- "And they shall be unto me a peculiar treasure, saith Jehovah of hosts, in the day that I prepare" @Malachi 3:17. That will be a day prepared by God and according to Him. Those who fear Jehovah will be His peculiar
{52}
treasure in that day. "And I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him" @Malachi 3:17. Here, we might bring in the epistle to the Galatians; we enter into the privileges of the family, into the family dignity as "sons".

PREPARATION IN VIEW OF THE ASSEMBLY (1)
@Matthew 17:1 - 8; @Matthew 17:22 - 27
-- It seemed to me that this chapter would help us to understand how we are to take our places in the assembly according to the divine mind. I had specially in mind the transfiguration and the reference which is found at the end of the chapter to sonship. This chapter is placed between chapter 16, where the Lord speaks for the first time of the assembly, and chapter 18 where He speaks of the kingdom in relation to the assembly. We most of us know that from chapter 13 instructions in regard of the assembly are in question, and that the end of these instructions is in chapter 18. Chapter 17 would result in giving us a heavenly tone to have our part in the assembly, which is seen in chapter 18. If we have not laid hold intelligently on our heavenly part and our place in the assembly, we shall not be able to act suitably. In chapter 17 the assembly is heavenly, in the sense of administering all that is good. It says that the Lord's "face shone as the sun, and his garments became white as the light". It is the light of heaven, but in the sense of administering all that is good. The Lord said that God makes the sun to shine on the righteous and on the wicked. If we do not lay hold of that principle, we shall be incapable of acting suitably in the assembly in the presence of good and evil.
The sun rises day after day, month after month, year after year, generation after generation, on the righteous and on the wicked; it shines in all its strength in spite of present conditions. The Lord shines upon us to control us, and it was His thought that Peter, James and John might shine brightly in
{54}
the same way in the kingdom. Coming down from the mountain, they find themselves in the presence of the power of Satan; but they were superior to the power of evil. Later, in the Acts, the attitude and action of Peter on the day of Pentecost showed that he had profited by that experience. Peter was able to say that they were "eyewitnesses of *his* majesty" (@2 Peter 1:16) when they were with the Lord on the mountain. Being established by Him to administer good, they were superior to the power of evil. In accord with this wonderful outshining of Christ, the Holy Spirit came down from heaven and was available to them at Jerusalem. Peter said, "Having therefore been exalted by the right hand of God, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which ye behold and hear", @Acts 2:33. All the wealth of heaven was abounding at Jerusalem. We see that, from His point of view, God was acting Himself, in spite of the wickedness that reigned at Jerusalem.
Matthew presents the transfiguration in a dignified way, because he wishes to insist on the *character* of the heavenly administration. His face shone as the sun, and His garments became white as the light. That heavenly light shines anew from the administrators of the wealth of heaven, as we see in the Acts. In this way we learn to overcome the power of evil in order to administer good; otherwise we shall be overcome by the evil. For example, if a brother sin against me, I am going to try to gain him. Peter asks the Lord, at the end of chapter 18, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? until seven times?" @Matthew 18:21. The Lord answers him, "I say not to thee until seven times, but until seventy times seven" @Matthew 18:22. Peter's question and the limit that he would suggest -- "until seven times?" -- show how little he had profited by the lesson of the Lord on the mount of Transfiguration. The thought
{55}
was that Peter should serve as a model to all those who were to have part in the assembly negatively and positively. The history of Peter, as Matthew gives it, brings out the mixture that is found in us all as in Peter. On the one hand, he confesses that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God; and on the other, he would have turned the Lord aside from the only path which made the introduction of the assembly possible. And it was Peter who said, in the presence of that light: "Let us make here three tabernacles: for thee one, for Moses one, and one for Elias". You see in Peter in chapter 16, the flesh in which Satan can act in us. It is a very serious thing, that a believer might be an instrument of Satan who would even try to divert the Lord from the only path in which He could glorify God in the presence of sin. And in that light that was shining, Peter would put the Lord on the same level as Moses and Elias. Then, he would limit the grace that characterises the kingdom of God. Nevertheless he formed in type the material for the assembly which the Lord was going to build. "Thou art Peter", (@Matthew 16:18) the Lord said; so that in Peter we see how the Lord is engaged with each one of us. Finally, Peter denies the Lord with oaths. In measure as we come to know ourselves, we see ourselves in what comes out in Peter, and we abhor what is in us. When this lesson is learned, we are ready to take our place in the assembly.
We see in Peter the two sides which exist in the same person: on the one hand the evidence of the work of God in the soul, and on the other, the capacity we have to be in opposition to what is of God.
-- I am led to think: What a mixture I am myself!
-- What a work is needed that these two characters may be disentangled, in order that the Lord may have the believer as a vessel at His disposal in the assembly! So that, like Paul, each may be led to say, "By
{56}
God's grace I am what I am" @1 Corinthians 15:10. Perhaps we have not fully realised that God has taken us in hand that we may have part in such a privilege.
Now, the principle that characterises the assembly is that *she comes down;* that is what is developed in the Acts. She is heavenly; and in chapter 2 of the Acts a sound was heard coming out of heaven; in chapter 9 a light comes out of heaven; in chapter 10 a sheet comes down from heaven; so that in Revelation 21, the holy city comes down out of the heaven from God. Heavenly grace comes down.
-- She is heavenly in origin, in character, in grace.
-- Here, it says, "As they descended from the mountain".
-- "He that descended is the same who has also ascended up above all the heavens" @Ephesians 4:10. He descended first into the lower parts of the earth; and we see that the definite thought of God relative to the assembly is that she descends; the gifts have come from an ascended Christ, but who first descended; for this reason the gifts which are here are all to be characterised by the grace of the One who gave them: apostles, prophets, teachers, evangelists, all for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ. Then, what is to characterise the servants is the principle of descending to serve.
It is a question therefore of our taking our place in heavenly dignity and grace. In this way the assembly is, through grace, morally elevated above the religious systems of the world. If in the assembly it is a matter of dealing with evil, it must be dealt with on the principle of the sun which rules in the universe of God. In the house of God, government is necessary for good, which involves the refusal of evil; we do not act with malice, nor with the idea of punishment. We learn to act as God acts in the assembly.
They come to put a question to Peter; the question is in verse 24: "Does your teacher not pay the
{57}
didrachmas?" If I belong to the assembly I ought to answer questions. If in spirit I dwell in heaven, and if I come down from heaven and they put such questions to me, I answer, My master is heavenly; it is not for Him to pay taxes. Questions that are put to me I ought to answer with spiritual intelligence. Peter had answered the question: "Who do ye say that I am?" (@Matthew 16:15) by saying, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God" @Matthew 16:16. And the Lord answered him, "Flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens" @Matthew 16:17. It was a revelation, and not merely the result of faith in an objective truth. I must learn to be governed by the light given. Peter, having been on the mountain of glory, ought to have answered himself, but he was not yet governed by the light. He had not in his soul the sense of the greatness of Christ, and he put the Lord on the level of others. It was a question of paying the tax for the service of the temple. Why should the Lord pay that tax? The Lord gives us the particular light for the moment, but the general principle of my being is that I have light and that I respond to it.
Then, it is necessary for Peter to be afresh instructed on that point, and the Lord anticipates him: "What does thou think, Simon? the kings of the earth, from whom do they receive custom or tribute? from their own sons or from strangers? Peter says to him, From strangers. Jesus said to him, Then are the sons free". He had only just heard the voice coming from the excellent glory: "This is my beloved Son". Why then did he not introduce this light into his answer? Our answers ought to be governed by the light that we have received. May we always know how to give an answer related to the light that governs us? We can never admit that the Lord is on the same level as others. Already on the mountain, Peter would have been ready to put the Lord on the
{58}
level of Moses and Elias; but now he would put Him on the level of those who pay taxes. "Then are the sons free". It is blessed to see that the Lord does not say to him, '*the Son*', but *"the sons"*. He would use Peter's ignorance for his blessing, as He would for ours -- we who are sons. In order to establish fully the truth of the glory of His Person, He says, "But that we may not be an offence to them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up, and when thou hast opened its mouth thou wilt find a stater; take that and give it to them for me and thee". By this act He shows His almighty power. The truth as to His Person is presented, His power as Creator, having authority over the sea.
-- That agrees with Psalm 8 where He has authority over "the fishes of the sea, whatever passeth through the paths of the seas" @Psalm 8:8.
-- It is a question of our being thus impressed by the greatness and glory of the Son; our souls being bathed in the sunlight that shines in that Person. The Son is seen on the mountain, and the salutation from on high comes out of the bright cloud. Then, coming down, He commands the fishes of the sea. Men can count the mountains, but no one can explore the depths of the seas and count the fishes. Only the Son is capable of that. "Yonder is the great and wide sea: therein are moving things innumerable, living creatures small and great" @Psalm 104:25. He says, "a hook" and "the first fish"; that is sufficient. If it had been a net, one might have taken a hundred fishes. But the infallibility with which the Lord secured this one fish ought to impress us as to the greatness of His Person. The Lord's intention was to make a living impression upon Peter. He was acquainted with fishing (it was his calling), and the Lord had established him a "fisher of men", so that as a fisherman he was struck by the Lord's knowledge regarding this one fish.
{59}
-- Elsewhere He could say to Nathanael, again showing His greatness: "When thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee" @John 1:48.
-- The piece of money was in the mouth of the fish. It was the piece that was needed. But *the sons* are free. The epistle to the Romans corresponds to that; the truth of that epistle sets us in liberty to take our place as sons.
-- This piece of money governs all that concerns our journey?
-- In the epistle to the Romans we have light to pass through the world in a manner suitable to God. It speaks of the Spirit of adoption; but sonship is developed in the epistle to the Ephesians.
-- And in Galatians?
-- It is indeed a little on the same level, but it was necessary to recover the Galatians who had strayed from that position. The relationship is one thing, but the position is another. In Romans, as in Galatians, it is a question of sons; but in Ephesians we learn that the dwelling-place of the sons is heaven. We have been predestinated to sonship; and in the epistle to the Ephesians, the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ "has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ", (@Ephesians 1:3) and it is in the power of that truth that we come down from heaven to take our place down here in the assembly.
-- It says of the brother: "If thy brother sin against thee, go, reprove him between thee and him alone" @Matthew 18:15.
-- You come down from heaven, and you see your brother at his true value.

WISDOM IN THE PRESENCE OF APOSTASY AND THE ANTICHRISTIAN REBELLION
@James 3:17; @2 Samuel 14:1 - 5,14,21 - 27; @2 Samuel 20:16 - 22
On this occasion I should like to speak of wisdom and bring out how wisdom appears in the presence of apostasy and the antichristian rebellion. The epistle of James specially distinguishes between the wisdom which comes down from above and earthly wisdom. We shall see both exemplified in the second book of Samuel; but for the moment we are going to be occupied with the wisdom which comes down from above. It is this wisdom that normally characterises Christians, who are indeed children of wisdom, as the Lord Jesus Himself said, "Wisdom has been justified of all her children" @Luke 7:35. And in which epoch of the history of the people of God has there been a greater need of wisdom than at present? We have come to the days of antichrist. John says, "According as ye have heard that antichrist comes, even now there have come many antichrists, whence we know that it is the last hour" @1 John 2:18. An "hour" indicates a crisis; the last hour is an hour of trial; wherefore it is necessary to have wisdom from above. And James says, "If any one of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all freely and reproaches not, and it shall be given to him" @James 1:5. Now you can see how the matter stands in Scripture. There is a very special emphasis on wisdom. In Daniel it says, "The wicked shall do wickedly", (@Daniel 12:10) and that is all we can expect from them; whatever modification there might be in this world, the wicked will do wickedly; then it says, "None of the wicked shall understand" (@Daniel 12:10); they are outside divine understanding, and have not wisdom. "But the wise shall understand" @Daniel 12:10. "And they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the
{61}
expanse; and they that turn the many to righteousness as the stars, for ever and ever" @Daniel 12:3. And when, in Revelation, it is a question of facing the antichristian problem, it says, "Here is wisdom. He that has understanding let him count the number of the beast" @Revelation 13:18. You see that the Spirit of God mentions wisdom in view of the spirit of antichrist. It would be good, if we do not possess this wisdom, to ask God to give it to us: He gives liberally to all, for He desires that His own may be known as children of wisdom. I would commend to the young the book of Proverbs. It is entitled "Proverbs of Solomon, son of David" @Proverbs 1:1. He is the son of the father's love. It is a book that belongs to the kingdom of the Son of the Father's love. We, Christians, have been delivered from the authority of darkness and have been brought into the kingdom of the Son of the Father's love. The book of Proverbs is for all those who are found in that kingdom that they may be saved from the man that speaketh froward things and from the evil woman, "from the flattery of the tongue of the strange woman" @Proverbs 6:24.
I come to the second book of Samuel where antichrist is typified by Absalom. He is a murderer; he is a rebel. He was justly banished; he deserved death. But we find what corresponds to the modern wisdom of this world which is used in current preaching. The woman of Tekoah is one of those who can be used in view of others. She was employed by Joab who was himself a murderer, and while professing to serve David, he had no love for him. He was an ambitious man, only seeking to carry out his own schemes, and he made use of this woman to attain his end. No child of wisdom would lend himself to this stratagem, but he holds himself at the service of Christ. This woman's wisdom was impure, while the wisdom of the Christian, "the wisdom from above first is pure, then peaceful, gentle, yielding, full of
{62}
mercy and good fruits, unquestioning, unfeigned". The woman was not characterised by that wisdom; she pretended to be a widow and to have two sons, one of whom had killed the other. She is like thousands who, nowadays, are employed to achieve the aim of others; and with all that, this woman preached the gospel, but whence had she received it? She had received it from Joab. I may study Scripture as a science, as theology. I may get at it through the theological schools. The words may be put into my mouth by another, and I may repeat them like a parrot; but the true preacher receives his words from Christ. This woman had the words from Joab; and they were, however, the words of truth. I refer to her own words: "For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again". We can give thanks for such words, for God can use them; we can thank Him for the bibles that are in the churches. God makes use of His word, even when it is in the mouth of Balaam or his ass. But God desires to use children of wisdom. He desires the preacher to be in correspondence with his preaching. God revealed Christ in Paul, that he might announce Him as glad tidings among the nations.
I would like to show you how the gospel preached by this woman brings back the banished one. The end of the gospel was not to bring back Absalom as he was formerly, an assassin, typifying someone who hates the Lord Jesus. The king allows Absalom to return. This is what we have in our days; man according to flesh has a place among Christians, and so all kinds of falsehoods and blasphemies are taught at the present time. What did Absalom do two years after his return? He set the field of barley on fire. Barley represents God's firstfruits, and Christ is God's Firstfruits. All wisdom's children love Christ, and give Him the pre-eminence, while Absalom
{63}
set the field of barley on fire. On all hands the truth as to the Person of Christ is attacked and given up.
I wish to show you how in chapter 20 a true child of wisdom preserves God's inheritance. We need to study these chapters in the second book of Samuel having regard to what is happening around us. The wisdom of this world is opposed to that which comes from God. You will see the wisdom of Hushai opposed to the wisdom of Ahithophel. If you study these chapters you will see how the return of the true king depended on the wisdom which comes from above. It was by the wisdom of Hushai that the counsel of Ahithophel was brought to nought; and that led to the return of David.
We are on the eve of the Lord's return, and we are on the eve of the coming of antichrist. The children of wisdom have knowledge of these things and they see that the assembly is the vessel in which the all-various wisdom of God is displayed even now. But how can this wisdom be seen by the angels, if it is not manifested in the localities where the saints are? This wisdom is, so to speak, woven into 1 Corinthians. Paul says to the Corinthians, "Thus there is not a wise person among you!" @1 Corinthians 6:5. What a challenge for the Corinthians! He could not speak to them as to grown men; he could not speak to them of the hidden wisdom. They were only carnal babes. Is there not a wise man among you? How shall we find our way through the labyrinth of this world? A wise man in a locality may become the salvation of the whole locality. You see that the carnal state of babes is able to hinder us from obtaining the hidden wisdom which none of the wise of this world knows, the wisdom that God prepared before the world for our glory. You see, dear brethren, how important it is that we should be enlarged as to wisdom, to have part in the hidden wisdom which God prepared before the world for our glory, a wisdom which God
{64}
evidently did not use in the creation of the universe. It is a wisdom which is developed in the affections of the saints. The angels and heavenly principalities see the all-various wisdom of God in the assembly. In the second book of Samuel, this wisdom defeats human wisdom. The result is seen in that David shortly after returns into his house. Wisdom prepares the place for the Lord among the saints; it is found with Solomon who built the temple and it is essential to have it in order that Christ may have a place now among us. How serious this challenge is, addressed to each company -- "There is not a wise man among you!" @1 Corinthians 6:5.
I wish to show you now how wisdom protects the inheritance. A glorious inheritance is given to us to share in, and one man can spoil many things. Another rebel rose up against David. How great was the need of a wise person! The principal man was a murderer. It often happens that such a man acquires a place among us -- an ambitious, unsubdued man, someone who desires the first place. He pretended to act for David. He would have the rebel and he would destroy the inheritance of Jehovah.
"And a wise woman cried out of the city, Hear, hear: say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee. And he came near to her; and the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he said, I am he. And she said to him, Listen to the words of thy handmaid. And he said, I am listening. And she spoke saying, They were wont to speak in old time saying, Just inquire in Abel; and so they ended. I am peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel. Why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of Jehovah?"
This discourse contains two things: the mother in Israel and the inheritance of Jehovah. Joab thought of neither the one nor the other; he was occupied
{65}
with himself. It was right that Sheba the rebel should be destroyed, but then what would become of the mother in Israel and the inheritance? How many mothers in Israel are there among us? Yesterday evening we were speaking of fathers. The Lord said to His disciples, "Call not any one your father upon the earth; for one is your Father, he who is in the heavens" @Matthew 23:9. It is one thing to have the name of father and another to be truly a father. We do not ourselves give to anyone the name of father, but we reverence those who are fathers, who know Him who is from the beginning, and those who exercise fatherhood. They have great value. We ought to cherish them. And as to "mothers"? Each sister may become a mother in Israel. This woman was wise; she was thus "a mother in Israel". As we need the influence of a father, we also need a mother in Israel. She is wise and she has victories. Deborah is a typical mother, the wife of Lapidoth, whose name means 'light'; she was related to one who had light, but that is not sufficient. She had personal exercises and she was a mother in Israel. She dwelt "under the palm-tree of Deborah" (@Judges 4:5); it was not that of her husband, but it was a question of her personal triumphs; she had her own exercises before God. She is none the less a woman for that, but she has her own relations with God and she has maternal instincts; she judges Israel. There was one wise person among the people who came to her to have her judgment. Those who need wisdom will come to her to obtain it. This wise woman was truly a mother in Israel, and facing the situation she said, "They were wont to speak in old time saying, Just inquire in Abel; and so they ended".
The true mother does not go in for novelties; she does not say, Times and principles have changed. She goes back to the old times. In other words, she goes back to apostolic days. Like a father, she knows
{66}
Him who is from the beginning. She recognises the present voice of the Spirit; she holds to first principles, like the first Christians who "persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers" @Acts 2:42.
It is a very beautiful thing when, we can finish a discussion among us according to divine principles. This woman accuses Joab of having been willing to destroy a mother in Israel and the inheritance of Jehovah. She was right, and Joab says, I only want Sheba the rebel. Then it says the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. A mother in Israel seeks to exercise the conscience of all the children of God. She does not want things to be adjusted only by a group of Christians, as sometimes happens. Each one has a conscience. The apostle speaks to intelligent persons, and his epistle was addressed to the assembly of God, which includes all. In everything that occurs, the conscience of each one must be considered. Her wisdom led her to all the people. And the result was that they brought the head of Sheba and threw it to Joab. It was the people of the city who did it. Things ought to be done by the assembly, which alone has administrative authority. Even in apostolic days, after a great discussion among the apostles and elders (@Acts 15), they were all assembled and the decree was promulgated by the apostles and the assembly. The decree expressed the mind of heaven. That is exactly what God wishes. And the all-various wisdom of God is seen by all the heavenly intelligences.
I believe that this is enough to show how wisdom bears on our position. It is wonderful that the all various wisdom of God should be seen in us. This thought ought to encourage us to ask for wisdom which is available to all. "If any one of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all freely and reproaches not, and it shall be given to him" @James 1:5.
{67}
On the one hand, we discern antichristian principles; but we have wisdom to know how to go forward. On the other hand, the all-various wisdom of God is seen collectively; there is a testimony rendered to God in each locality.

PREPARATION IN VIEW OF THE ASSEMBLY (2)
@Matthew 18:1 - 22
-- Yesterday, we were engaged, in chapter 17 of this gospel, with the face of the Lord which shone as the sun. Those of us who have part in the kingdom and the assembly ought to take on this character which is expressed in connection with the Lord. There should be rule, but it ought to be a rule of benignity, as the sun shines in a beneficent way over the whole earth, without regard to what may be found on the earth. Thus, as being in the kingdom, we ought to reflect what is found in heaven, and for that, the truth of sonship is essential. The end of chapter 17 shows us that we are sons. We are brought into company with Christ, His companions. Being thus in the family, we are personally dignified; we are qualified to have part in the kingdom, according to the thoughts of God. It says that the sons of David were chief rulers. There is a family dignity secured, and this dignity enables us to take a humble place in order to help the interests of God on the earth. It is said, with regard to the greatest servants, the apostles, that "God has set us the apostles for the last, as appointed to death. For we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and men. *We* are fools for Christ's sake, but *ye* prudent in Christ: *we* weak, but *ye* strong: *ye* glorious, but *we* in dishonour. To the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and are in nakedness, and buffeted, and wander without a home, and labour, working with our own hands. Railed at, we bless; persecuted, we suffer it; insulted, we entreat: we are become as the offscouring of the world, the refuse of all, until now" @1 Corinthians 4:9 - 13. It is God who had set them for the
{69}
last; in their outward circumstances they occupied the lowest place among men. But nevertheless, they were great inwardly, and they were conscious of it. It was by reason of this consciousness that they could take the lowest place, an obscure place, a despised place. Thus, Matthew 17 has in view to qualify the saints for chapter 18; there is grace to go down. This is not condescension, but humbling. The Lord is the One who descended into the lower parts of the earth.
-- The Lord would have us learn to follow Him.
-- We remarked yesterday that it is first said that the Lord descends, and then that He ascends, in Ephesians 4, before the gifts are spoken of. If any one has a gift, that gift can only harm him, unless he knows how to go down. So the question at the beginning of chapter 18 of Matthew was far beneath the teaching of chapter 17. "Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?" Evidently the disciples had failed to learn the great lesson of chapter 17; and I fear that many have undertaken the Lord's service only with a view to distinguishing themselves. Those who go in for politics, for commerce, for military service, do it to distinguish themselves personally, but the Lord said, "*Ye* shall not be thus". Christianity is opposed to all that is in this world. If I have the ambition to make myself eminent in the Lord's service, I expose myself to Satan. It was he who led the Lord to the edge of the temple. Satan puts before you the hope of attaining the pinnacle of religious renown.
-- By the "edge of the temple" (@Matthew 4:5) you understand the culminating point of religious renown?
-- The Lord calls to Him "a little child". There was *one* whom He could call; there was *one* who was available to the Lord. It does not say 'having taken', but "having called". The principle in Scripture is that the truth is illustrated for us. We
{70}
can desire nothing better than to be an example ourselves, as the Lord said, "Altogether that which I also say to you", @John 8:25. Then if the Lord has *someone* who has the spirit of a little child, he can illustrate this principle. It says that "Jesus having called a little child to him, set it in their midst, and said, Verily I say to you, Unless ye are converted and become as little children, ye will not at all enter into the kingdom of the heavens". We have not only the teaching, but we have the thing itself.
-- And it is illustrated by "a little child".
-- So, in this passage, the Lord brings out the value of such a little child. If we do not know the value of the saints, we shall not serve them rightly.
-- The value of the saints, in the Lord's eyes, is that they are animated by the spirit of the little child.
-- We all know how much we appreciate the value of such a spirit, the spirit of a little child. There are two aspects, two features of ministry, which are illustrated in the example of Paul in chapter 20 of the Acts; the first is a discourse, and the second is a conversation (@Acts 20:7,11). Our present reading should take on the character of a conversation. In a conversation, several talk together. This passage in chapter 20 of the Acts is prophetic. The great revival of the truth in the last century has been characterised by discourses and conversations. Thus a meeting such as we have this afternoon brings out the character of the temple which includes all the saints. The apostle said to the Corinthians, "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?" @1 Corinthians 3:16. Thus the truth comes out when we converse together as brethren dwelling in unity. In our chapter, the Lord speaks, but Peter puts a question which brings out much light: "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him?"
{71}
-- The preparation of the bride depends much on her conversation, does it not?
-- It says that she has made herself ready.
-- These conversations result in confidence among the brethren; and so we have increased capacity to receive spiritual things. The clerical system is opposed to that and does not prepare for heaven. Conversations among the brethren prepare us for heaven. Communications among the brethren will help us into the enjoyment of divine things.
-- And they will not cease: we shall enjoy this liberty eternally.
-- So the Songs of Degrees culminate in @Psalm 133 where it is said that it is good and pleasant for brethren to dwell together in unity. The great revival in the time of Nehemiah was characterised by the feast of tabernacles; these tabernacles typified conversations between brethren; they were everywhere: on the roofs, in the courts, in the courts of the house of God, in the open spaces. It was a joyous scene of conversations among brethren; and the exercises of the Songs of Degrees found their culminating point in that the brethren were united together at Jerusalem. I have no doubt that the feast of tabernacles is the counterpart of heaven. As the result of the coming of the Holy Spirit from heaven, heavenly thoughts have been introduced down here. It is very remarkable that the Lord appeared in the midst, of five hundred brethren together. It was a large meeting; and I believe that by this appearing the Lord wished to honour the brethren. How He appreciated the relationship of brethren!
-- The subject before us is the kingdom and the value of "a little child". The world takes little account of them, but they have such a value that "their angels in the heavens continually behold the face of my Father who is in the heavens". Consequently
{72}
a great responsibility rests on "whosoever shall offend one of these little ones who believe in me". Offences will come, but "Woe to the world because of offences!" The world has found an inlet among the saints and has turned them aside. The Lord draws near to each one of us, calling our attention to the hand, what I do, my work: "If thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut it off and cast it from thee". If I am engaged in whatever it may be that is contrary to the Lord, I must cut off my hand; for example, commerce has ruined many persons. Then there is the eye -- what one sees, what one desires. The eye can see much at once. The apostle John says to the young men, "Love not the world, nor the things in the world" @1 John 2:15. The eye can travel far and desire many things, and they are hurtful to our souls. In the kingdom, we learn to show ourselves very severe towards our natural tendencies.
-- And with regard to "thy foot"?
-- The feet would indicate my movements, where go.
-- It is my walk?
-- We ought to walk in the paths of righteousness.
-- Compare @Proverbs 4:20 - 27. In verse 26 it says, "Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be well-ordered".
-- That is a very good quotation. As we said yesterday evening, the book of Proverbs is for those who are in the kingdom of the Son of the Father's love. It culminates in the woman of worth at the end of the book. It leads us to our part in the assembly. We are trustworthy: "The heart of her husband confideth in her" @Proverbs 31:11.
-- The Lord said to His disciples, "Have salt in yourselves" @Mark 9:50. Then there will be genuine peace. One has to be severe with oneself.
-- Like the sharp knives of Joshua.
-- For circumcision.
{73}
-- In the light of all that has been said, if my brother sins, what am I going to do? He is one of the little ones, but he is my brother. He has sinned *against me*. It is evident the disciples did not put many questions, and the Lord raises one: "If thy brother sin against thee, go, reprove him between thee and him alone".
-- We do not sufficiently appreciate the spirit of the little child, and what the brethren are, the affections that are proper to the brethren.
-- We are not possessed by the affections proper to brethren.
-- Otherwise we should go to gain our brother.
-- The Lord does not say, 'If a brother', but "If thy brother". 'A brother' is general; but "thy brother" is more particular.
-- One of the first questions God put to man was: "Where is *thy brother*?"
-- The want of the brotherly spirit is condemned more than anything else in Scripture. Frequently we find that God expresses His abhorrence of Esau, and the last book of the Old Testament says, "I loved Jacob, and I hated Esau" @Malachi 1:2 - 3. We see how much God abhors the absence of the brotherly spirit among His own. I have realised of late in a special way how little we are in brotherly affections. If we are conscious of affections which are proper to brethren, we shall not be able to do without them, and although it may be my brother who has sinned, I must gain him. So the Lord says, "Go, reprove him, between thee and him alone". Much courage is needed to go to find a brother alone.
-- But love gives courage. It is because brotherly love is lacking that one does not go to find his brother.
-- Then, Peter takes up the thought again, asking, "How often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? until seven times?" Seven times was not enough.
{74}
-- Peter thought "seven times" was a great many, but the Lord goes to "seventy times seven".
-- That means that there are no limits. It is not necessary to count the number of times we forgive. Then we are, so to speak, pervaded with the heavenly atmosphere.
-- The Lord says elsewhere that if thy brother sin seven times in the day, he must be forgiven. "*If he should repent*, forgive him" @Luke 17:3.
-- But in this chapter it is not a question of repentance.
-- There is no limit.
-- The principle is that there is forgiveness with you.
-- What the Lord says arises out of this question. He speaks of a man who was forgiven, and this bondman found another who owed him a hundred denarii and said to him, "Pay". The divine thought is that the believer ought to reflect what is before God.
-- These two men were both in the kingdom. They were not outside.
-- What the Lord brings out here is that the principle of forgiveness ought always to be found with the Christian. But then, in order that this principle may be effective, there must be repentance in the one who has sinned. I believe that love comes in there to help us to act wisely, so that repentance is produced. Therefore the first thing is to go and see our brother alone. If you do not gain him when you go to him alone, you must take with you two or three persons, that every matter may stand upon the word of two witnesses or of three. We are in the kingdom of the heavens, and all is to stand on the principle of testimony. It says, "If he will not listen to them, tell it to the assembly". The assembly is therefore introduced here to help me to save my brother. The great thing is to lead my brother to listen to me.
{75}
-- I was comparing with this what is said to the Ephesians, in connection with brethren in the assembly (@Ephesians 4). What is presented in Matthew in connection with the kingdom, is found in Ephesians in connection with the assembly.
-- The assembly is introduced down here as external means. It is a question of going to find my brother and of gaining him. That is not natural; in the human order the offended one does not go to find the offender; he waits for the offender to come and apologise, but a brotherly heart goes to find his brother.
-- We see indeed the contrast between man's world and God's world. I have a brother to help. I can take two brothers with me; and I can appeal to the assembly. Then, if that brother is hardened and will not listen to the assembly, "let him be to thee as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer".
-- For *me*?
-- It is a question of the resources that I possess in the kingdom, towards a brother who has sinned. Then the Lord shows that the assembly has divine prerogatives. "Verily I say to you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on the earth shall be loosed in heaven". Things are therefore adjusted; as we were speaking of it yesterday, the end is reached. Matters of discipline must not be allowed to continue indefinitely. The wise woman in 2 Samuel 20 said, "They were wont to speak in old time saying, Just inquire in Abel; *and so they ended*" @2 Samuel 20:18. We have here first principles, and when they are observed by the assembly the decision ought to be final. The Lord says, "Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on the earth shall be loosed in heaven". The thing is adjusted until the moment when everything can be loosed. Therefore the saints should walk according
{76}
to these principles. We have the adjustment of the thing in the decision of the assembly. Then what follows immediately is that everything is loosed when the time is ripe. The Corinthians did not move quickly, when it was a question of loosing; and the apostle said, You ought rather to forgive him. Thus, assembly prerogatives are transferred to a day of small things. The Lord continues, "Again I say to you". He brings in supplementary instructions applicable to our days: two agree and obtain help from their Father in the heavens; in the second place, two or three are gathered together unto the Lord's name. In these supplementary instructions we have resources which enable us to reach the end. The Lord never fails. The most complicated difficulties find their solution in the supplementary instructions which the Lord gives. Prayer brings down the help of the Father who is in the heavens, and the fact that two or three are gathered together to the Lord's name secures to us His presence, and His presence assures finality. Things are adjusted, as the wise woman said, "And so they ended" @2 Samuel 20:18. We can judge these things and reach the end of them. It would be sad to have a long list of things to adjust. The woman went in her wisdom to all the people. The woman threw the head of Sheba to Joab. "And so they ended" @2 Samuel 20:18.

THE MODEL -- IN INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE CHARACTER
@Luke 7:44 - 48; @1 Thessalonians 1:2 - 8
I have in mind to say a few words on the subject of a model. I need not say that Christ is the Model. I believe that, from the outset, God has worked in relation to a model. In the creation of Adam, God had a model before Him; and Adam typified Him who was to come. The principle comes to light particularly in relation to moral and spiritual things. It does not speak of a Model when it is a matter of the physical creation. Nevertheless, it is written that the worlds were framed by the word of God. His word was the expression of what was in His mind; there was the divine plan of this world. No natural man can even understand that. By faith we apprehend that the worlds were framed by the word of God. Men who have not faith may give themselves up to speculations, but they do it to their own cost and they never arrive at a right thought of the physical universe. Only by faith can we apprehend that it was framed by the word of God. Those who know God are interested in what comes from His word. We recognise the things that are made as representing a spiritual order of things; the invisible things of Him are seen in the things created, His eternal power and His divinity. These things are laid hold of by the mind of the believer, but on the principle of faith.
When we come to things which concern the moral universe, God is careful to show that on this point He has always had a model before Him. For example, Moses was taken by God on to the mountain, and during forty days God made His model pass before Moses. During forty days he neither ate nor drank, so that he was ready to receive and understand
{78}
spiritual thoughts. And so, the whole tabernacle and all that was connected with it was according to the model that God had shown him. As says the writer of the epistle to the Hebrews, "See, saith He, that thou make all things according to the pattern which has been shown to thee in the mountain" @Hebrews 8:5. We see then that God, in framing the moral world, had a model before Him. All that of which I have spoken in Exodus is only a type of what we find in the gospels. The Lord said, "Come to me, all ye who labour and are burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn *from me*" @Matthew 11:28. The Lord presents Himself as the Model. This passage gives the great features of this Model; as being rejected by His own He turns to His Father. He rejoiced in spirit and said, "I praise thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes" @Matthew 11:25. He is superior to all opposition down here. He is in the presence of His Father; He is in relation with His God and Father. He is the Model for all those who are going to fill the heavens and the earth. All is to be developed from Him and according to Him. The disciples were there as babes. These were to be brought up according to Him. We can see how this blessed system is modelled after Christ. There is nothing that belongs to man. All the inventions of this world find no place there; this system had been designed before the foundation of the world according to "the hidden wisdom" @1 Corinthians 2:7. When the physical system was formed, Jesus was there as Wisdom, and how much more when the system was formed which is to subsist eternally. "As therefore ye have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in him" (@Colossians 2:6); all that is contrary to Him must be rigorously refused by His own. We can see, in the system which surrounds us, how far men have got away from this model, while,
{79}
when it is a question of recovering us, God always recovers us to this model; and I wish to show you how this principle is developed individually and collectively. I have chosen these scriptures, the first to represent the individual model, and the second to represent the collective model.
This woman in chapter 7 of Luke is one of the most intelligent believers in Scripture; she is a woman who loves Christ, and He can thus present her as a model. It is very interesting to speak of a person who loves Christ. I could draw your attention to Mary of Bethany who learns from Christ. In Mary of Bethany we have a model, if we wish to learn from Christ; and I need not say to all who are present, that one learns better at school than when one is alone. We learn, not only from the Master, but also from the pupils; you have to learn how to learn. I consider Mary of Bethany; it says she sat down at the feet of Jesus and was listening to His word; it was not a question with her of any subject whatever, but of what He was saying: He was saying wonderful things. All the intelligence of heaven was found in that blessed Man, and Mary of Bethany seized the occasion she had. She desired to understand *all* that the Lord would say to her. She was like Timothy who, later on, wished to receive all that was presented to him. "But *thou* hast followed up my teaching ..." @2 Timothy 3:10, note. We need the truth in its entirety. Some have given themselves to certain features of the truth, but we need the whole. Christ is the truth objectively, and the Spirit is the truth in us. That is to say that there should be the truth correspondingly in the saints; the truth in its entirety was maintained in the Christians at the beginning. Mary is a model scholar. The name of the woman in Luke 7 is not given. It was sufficient to say that she loved Christ, and I have no doubt her name was well known. But the Holy Spirit has hidden her name. He presents
{80}
her name *in her character*, to Simon. She is a model. The Lord knew the qualities of the model that He presented, and He says, "Seest thou this woman?" It is a great thing if only there is one soul to whom the Lord can draw attention in a locality. This woman did not say that she loved the Lord, but she showed it by her acts; if one proves something by one's acts, that is greater. The Corinthians could speak of love, but Paul says, "Yet show I unto you a way of more surpassing excellence", @1 Corinthians 12:31. He could say much more than the Corinthians, but it was necessary to show it, and he could show it, for I suppose he is in the front rank among those who love the Lord; I have no doubt that he loved Him more than John. He was the greatest of sinners, but according to Luke 7, the one who has sinned much loves much. Paul was in the front rank among the lovers of Christ. He had such a consciousness of the love of Christ that he says, "If any one love not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be Anathema". He could show things like this woman. The Lord says to Simon, "Seest thou this woman?" The cold, cynical critic of Jesus was present; but there was also this woman who loved Him. What a striking contrast, beloved, between the two!
However, the Lord says, Simon, thou seest here My ideal of a person who loves Me; this ideal is in thy house; l am in thy house.
*Thou* gavest Me not water on My feet, but *she* has washed My feet with tears, and wiped them with her hair.
*Thou* gavest Me not a kiss, but *she* has not ceased kissing My feet. It is not one or two kisses, but continual kisses; such is love!
*Thou* didst not anoint My head with oil, but *she* has anointed My feet with ointment. I understand it is a matter here of an ointment composed of myrrh. How suitable that was!
{81}
His feet were walking in a hostile world, in suffering; His feet suffered, His feet that brought divine grace. This woman knew that all that involved suffering.
How little we think of suffering! When Christ was raised from among the dead, it says that He presented Himself to His disciples after He had suffered. How little we think that divine things have reached us by way of the sufferings of Calvary! In @Exodus 17, the rock, a type of Christ, was smitten. God said to Moses, "Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock on Horeb; and thou shalt strike the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink" @Exodus 17:6. God was witness of the sufferings of the Lord, when He was smitten, and the water has flowed. The Spirit of God is the result of the sufferings of Jesus. He desires to remind you of these things. He is the Spirit of a Christ who has suffered; and one of the principal parts of the anointing oil was myrrh. The descent of the Holy Spirit is the result of the sufferings of Jesus. This woman discerned that He must suffer. She anointed His feet with myrrh. So, beloved, we have the model and the question should be raised in our hearts Do I love the Lord? It is not a question of speaking of it, but of manifesting it. The tears express love. You remember, when Joseph kissed his brethren, how his love expressed itself in tears. That is real love, and this woman washed the Lord's feet with her tears. She had emotions. I believe in persons who love Christ possessing emotion of which love is the source. Paul said to Timothy, "Remembering thy tears" @2 Timothy 1:4. The Lord takes account of the tears of His own.
There is that which is to one's glory naturally. This woman put her hair at the Lord's feet; she wiped them with her hair. She did not have her hair short. Hair is given to woman for her glory. It is not merely acquired naturally, but is given to
{82}
her to cover her. It is therefore her glory, and she used it for the feet of Jesus. That speaks more than mere words. Then there was the ointment, the myrrh. Love is always ready to furnish what is suitable. Love never fails. This woman had what was suitable, just as Mary of Bethany who offered "a pound of ointment of pure nard of great price" @John 12:3. It is what she had kept for the day of His burial; it was the fruit of love.
I have spoken of the individual model. There are few subjects more impressive than this; for this woman represents the model chosen by the Lord, as being a person who loves Him.
I come to the collective aspect. I need not say that the collective model must be composed of the persons of whom I have spoken. The Christians of Thessalonica were chosen as a beloved company. The apostle says, "Knowing, brethren beloved by God". The apostle gives the reasons for which they were "beloved by God"; that is why they were models.
The woman of whom I have spoken was a model in the house of Simon. The Christians of Thessalonica were a model in all the region. It says, "Ye became models to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia". Then he adds, "For the word of the Lord sounded out from you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith which is towards God has gone abroad". They were models in their province, and in every place their faith was spoken of.
I wish to show you how this model was formed. God always works in view of what is collective. If He draws attention to an individual, it is to lead him to what is collective. In the seventh chapter of Luke we have the individual side. In the eighth chapter we have the Lord, the apostles, and certain women with Him, women who ministered to Him of their substance. We see clearly the link with chapter 7. How do we obtain substance? We read in Proverbs
{83}
that those who love wisdom obtain substance and wisdom fills their treasure. It is therefore clear that these women in chapter 8 include the woman in chapter 7. She is a woman who represents those who love Christ and who have substance. How does she use her substance? To glorify herself? No, beloved, but to serve the Lord. Like the Shunammite, she was a woman who was morally great, but she made use of her substance to receive the prophet. All that with which I have been enriched by the Lord is to be used in His service. The individual is to shine in the company: the Thessalonians shone in a collective way. Individually, they learnt from Paul, who said, "*Ye* became our imitators, and of the Lord". In other words, the Christians of Thessalonica knew how to take account of a model. They followed Paul as a model. What a model, beloved! A man who loved Christ! He evidenced it to them, for he loved them. He said, "As a nurse would cherish her own children, thus, yearning over you, we had found our delight in having imparted to you not only the glad tidings of God, but our own lives also, because ye had become beloved of us" @1 Thessalonians 2:7. What a model Paul was for these young believers! But they advanced; he says, "*Ye* became our imitators and of the Lord". It is good to take account of the one through whom the light has come to us. They took account of Paul and followed him; and advancing, they followed the Lord Jesus. It is the Lord Jesus who is the Model for us in the first place, like the pattern that was shown to Moses on the mountain. Then the Thessalonians knew how to take account of a collective model. He says, "Ye, brethren, have become imitators of *the assemblies of God* which are in Judaea in Christ Jesus" @1 Thessalonians 2:14. They had learnt that the assembly ought not to take on a purely local character; the assembly of God ought to be freed from what is local and national. All should be modelled after Christ. It is
{84}
a universal thought, a thought that has come down from heaven, and heavenly principles should characterise the assembly. These Thessalonians had not adopted Greek customs, but they went a long way, as far as Judaea, where the assemblies of God were established at the beginning, and we ought to be free from every national feeling as to the assembly; we ought to take account of all that is of God "in every place". They are "*the assemblies of God in Judea*". Paul says, "Thus I ordain in all the assemblies", @1 Corinthians 7:17. "But if any one think to be contentious, *we* have no such custom, nor the assemblies of God", @1 Corinthians 11:16. We all belong to the same assembly of God and the same blessed principles should characterise the saints in every place. Thus, these dear Thessalonians were models for the whole region around them. It says, "For the word of the Lord sounded out from you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith which is towards God has gone abroad". It also says: "Ye became models to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia". The secret of becoming models is to learn from a model, and it is essential to have the light which governs the assembly. It emanates from Christ and from heaven, and the divine thought is that all the assemblies should bear the same character in every place. This same character could be seen in Macedonia and in Achaia, as in Judaea.
You see the divine thought was unfolded at the beginning. These believers were, so to speak, young; according to the book of the Acts, Paul had only been among them three weeks, and in writing to them he honours them in a unique way. This is the only assembly to which the apostle says that it is "in God the Father" @1 Thessalonians 1:1. And this expression proves that they were acceptable to God the Father, for they had observed the idea of the divine model and were formed according to the model. God saw in these young
{85}
believers the blessed character of Christ. They had received the word "in much tribulation" but "with joy of the Holy Spirit". In that assembly, there was a formation that was relative, but exact, and it was a model for the whole region and "in every place".
Address by J.T. at Loriol, 6th May, 1926, evening.

THE SPIRIT IN THE BELIEVER
@Romans 8:1 - 17; @Exodus 17:3 - 7; @Numbers 21:17,18
-- The scripture which we have read in the epistle to the Romans speaks of the Spirit of God. The passages from the Old Testament are illustrations and types of the passage we have read in Romans 8. My exercise is to see how the believer begins to make progress and go forward by the Spirit. When the light of God penetrates into our souls, we are brought to see what the world is and then what the flesh in ourselves is. This light tends to set us in movement, but we shall hardly make any progress before being assured that we have the Spirit of God, and it is only as consciously possessing the Spirit of God that permanent movement is produced. Unless the Spirit is recognised in the believer, and not grieved, we shall not make any progress whether individually or collectively. We shall stand still in a certain measure of light, but there will be no progress, nor growth.
In the fourth chapter of the gospel of John, the Spirit is introduced under the figure of living water, meaning refreshment and energy: it is the Spirit Himself in view of deliverance; in chapter 7, it is the Spirit in view of testimony.
-- The Lord speaks of the Spirit which believers were going to receive; the Holy Spirit was not yet come because Jesus was not yet glorified.
-- In Exodus 17, the people murmur. "There was no water for the people to drink. And the people contended with Moses" @Exodus 17:1,2. Until the time when the young believer receives and recognises the Spirit, the tendency is always to murmur against God and against Christ. He can walk and live for some time by means of the light that he possesses; but until
{87}
the moment when the Spirit is received and recognised, he is a persecutor. Moses had to say, "Yet a little, and they will stone me!"
-- The difficulty was not in Moses, but in themselves.
-- Here, God does not reproach them, but on the contrary He tells Moses to go to Horeb: "Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock on Horeb; and thou shalt strike the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink". That is to say that it was necessary that Christ should suffer on account of the state of our souls, in order that we might receive the Holy Spirit. Many believers have not yet seen that the Spirit is the direct answer to the sufferings of Christ, and that which necessitated the sufferings of Christ must be judged in me. The people would have stoned Moses, but God forsook the Lord Jesus on the cross. The sufferings of Christ upon the cross were from the hand of God Himself. What men might have been able to inflict upon Him would never have made propitiation. Christ suffered from men, but propitiation comes from what He suffered from God, from His own hand; from that point of view the death of Christ was to the intent that man should receive the Spirit from God. Having received the Spirit, the saints should be completely delivered from all murmuring. We appreciate the Holy Spirit as the result of the sufferings of Christ. Then the believer enters immediately into conflict. Formerly he had been the opposer; but now it is Satan who attacks him. At Rephidim, Amalek comes to fight against Israel. Amalek is Satan, who works by means of the flesh; from the moment I receive the Spirit, Satan attacks me. Amalek is not the flesh, but he is Satan who works by means of the flesh. After the reception of the Spirit the conflict begins, and the conflict continues. It says, "Jehovah will have war with Amalek from generation to generation!" @Exodus 17:16. The conflict continues in the soul of the believer. The
{88}
flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit is against the flesh.
-- It is important to see that Amalek is Satan, and not the flesh; it is Satan, who attacks by means of the flesh.
-- Then there is provision in our favour, in the intercession of Moses. "Moses, Aaron and Hur went up to the top of the hill" @Exodus 17:10. Aaron the priest brings in the thought of holiness, and Hur, the thought of purity.
-- Moses represents Christ.
-- These three thoughts, seen in Moses, Aaron and Hur, are combined in the soul of the believer, who is conscious of the intercession of Christ and of the elements of holiness and purity. He begins to make progress according to God. You prove your nothingness, but you understand that Christ intercedes for you on high, and you have a sense of holiness. Christ has been raised by the Spirit of holiness, and it is the Holy Spirit who sheds the love of God abroad in our hearts. When it speaks of "the *Holy* Spirit", there is a reference to what we are, meaning that the flesh is not to be tolerated. In order to benefit by the intercession of Christ, it is absolutely necessary to refuse the flesh; there must be holiness and purity. I am exercised to see that my motives are pure. Thus there is victory over Satan who works in these conditions by means of the flesh. I acquire the habit of overcoming, which will stand me in good stead later on, when I have put on the panoply of God and am able to withstand all the powers of wickedness which are in the heavenlies. The young believer then begins to learn in his soul what victory is. "He that ruleth his spirit (is better) than he that taketh a city" @Proverbs 16:32. It would be good for us to search our souls and our hearts, to determine whether such victories are our daily experience.
{89}
-- These three types are very interesting: Moses, Aaron and Hur.
-- You have had some little experience of them in your soul, have you not? One would like every believer to be personally an overcomer; what lies at the very beginning of all spiritual progress is here, in the reception of the Spirit. Now, the believer learns to make war. Formerly, in the type, they were preserved from conflicts; Jehovah did not lead Israel the way of the Philistines, so that they should not see war on going out of Egypt; and at the Red Sea God intervened between the people and the Egyptians. The Lord is as a wall between us and our enemies. But this only took place at the beginning. On discovering that I possess the Spirit, I ought to defend myself.
-- Then, have we the thought of the young men: "Ye are strong" @1 John 2:14?
-- Possessing the Spirit, you have power in yourselves.
-- In this chapter, it is not a question yet of victory they are in conflict.
-- In verse 11 it says, "It came to pass when Moses raised his hand, that Israel prevailed" @Exodus 17:11. At the beginning, the young believer has to learn what dependence is. At first, the conflict is uncertain, swaying from one side to the other; but in reality the believer overcomes; he proves victorious.
-- For a moment there is uncertainty; but after a certain time, the believer has the assurance of victory.
-- "I have strength for all things in him that gives me power" @Philippians 4:13.
-- One reaches that, but later on. Victory is only obtained through great exercise. It is good to understand that there is no question of victory without having anxiety. If Amalek prevails for a moment, it causes me anxiety. There cannot be weakness in our Moses, but the weakness is in that I am lacking
{90}
in faith. A believer is established by passing through this experience.
Now, there is another figure: that is Joshua. I look at Joshua in conflict. He is a type of Christ not in an official but in a spiritual way. Joshua is not presented as occupying any official position. Up till now, he was simply Moses¬ attendant, but now his military ability must be tested. This ability will be seen later, fully developed, in the armies of Jehovah. Here I catch a glimpse of Christ as military Leader of the armies of God. We do not see Joshua any more in that capacity for forty years, but we get a glimpse of what he is and what he will be. For the moment, it is a question of *my own* victory. So it says in verse 13, "Joshua broke the power of Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword" (@Exodus 17:13); and that had to be written as a memorial, because it would need to be mentioned later.
-- Joshua could not have appeared before the rock was struck.
-- The memorial is to accompany the people.
-- It is said that the rock that followed them was Christ.
-- Yes. At the end of the seventh of Romans it says, "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me out of this body of death?" (@Romans 7:24) and then "I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord" @Romans 7:25. I come into victory, and the door is thus opened for chapter 8. I have now arrived at a definite point: I am no longer in flesh but in Spirit; and I have arrived at this point through conflict, being supported by the Holy Spirit.
But before going on, there is the altar. Moses built an altar and gave it a name -- Jehovah-Nissi, which means Jehovah my Banner. I have now an altar which involves a banner. I have gained this great victory thanks to the Lord. This altar is my public testimony. Henceforth I am not going to persecute
{91}
the saints. I am not going to murmur and complain. The saints can look at me and say, There is someone who is useful to us! Last year he was constantly complaining, but now he is useful.
-- I have my altar, and I have my banner.
-- An altar means that I am in public relation with God. The banner is the public testimony.
-- A banner can be displayed.
-- You fight under this banner.
-- We enter upon chapter 8 of Romans, do we not?
-- Exactly. "I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord" @Romans 8:25. There is the banner! It is God who has gained the victory, as the Psalmist says, "*By thee* I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall" @Psalm 18:29.
-- In the gospel of John, "He breathed into them, and says to them, Receive the Holy Spirit" @John 20:22. The Holy Spirit is the result of Christ smitten and raised.
-- Yes, that is indeed so in the eighth of Romans, but John 20 is further on than what we have here; it is rather a matter of entering the land, while in our passage in Exodus we are still at the threshold of the wilderness. The book of Numbers takes account of the people from that point of view, and they are set in military order, qualified for military service. They are all numbered, and each is in his place with relation to the tabernacle of testimony.
When we come to chapter 21 of Numbers, there is something to notice; that is that the people speak against God and against Moses. "Then Jehovah sent fiery serpents among the people, which bit the people; and much people of Israel died" @Numbers 21:6. God is occupied with sin in its source. I have to learn not only what sin is in man, but what it is in Satan. The introduction of the serpent is to carry us back in mind to the third chapter of Genesis, so that the believer may see what sin is and whence it comes.
{92}
-- There are these two questions: What is sin and what is its origin?
-- "By law is knowledge of sin" (@Romans 3:20); in Romans 7 we see how sin works in me. But I must know its origin; that is why, in John's writings, the Lord goes back to the origin. If it is a question of falsehood, Satan is a liar and the father of it; the devil sins from the beginning. He had sinned even before there was sin in Eden; so that in Numbers 21 we are occupied with the deepest things. We must be before God with regard to the whole question of sin, not only in men, but in Satan. The Lord Jesus Christ had to take it up in all these aspects. It is therefore a question of a serpent lifted up; which means that God, in the death of Christ, has taken up sin at its source, in such a way that it will never again raise itself against God. The thing has been dealt with at its source. God has rid Himself of it.
-- What is the application of it for us now?
-- We must be brought to see that Satan is against us, and that he has been against God.
-- Men do not know it. If Satan is against God, he is also against man, and man ought to be brought to know it.
-- The serpents bit the people (this is what we have to experience) and the only way of deliverance was to look up, to the serpent lifted up. God has dealt in righteousness with sin in its source. He who looked lived, and having learnt this, I live now in the full light of the condemnation of sin in its source. I see that sin is condemned, not only in man, but in Satan. I am in the light of this victory; now the believer lives and moves: he makes progress. In @Numbers 21:10, it says, "The children of Israel journeyed", and in verse 16 they arrived at the well: "And from thence to Beer; that is the well of which Jehovah spoke to Moses, Assemble the people, and I will give them water" @Numbers 21:16.
{93}
-- Before that, it needed serpents; now it needs water. The believer is seen in relation to all that has been presented. I have the Holy Spirit in the light of the fact that sin has been condemned and judged in the flesh and in every respect. The way is open.
-- Not only do the people go forward, but at the end of chapter 21, they conquer the land, smite the enemies and dwell in their cities. The nobles who digged the well, at the word of the lawgiver, were men of spiritual power, namely the apostles.
-- The apostles had the "ruler's wand" (@Numbers 21:18, note).
-- The lawgiver would be Christ. The staves would symbolise experience. If the staff is a symbol of power or rule, in that case it would be what belongs to a brother who has moral power. The apostles had moral authority, and it was based on what they were morally, and the saints are able to drink of the water as the result of those who have had experience. "Israel sang this song".
Now the presence of the Spirit is definitely recognised. When Amalek is smitten and the altar is built, indicating that the Lord is our Banner, then we are conscious that a power dwells in us superior to that of the world. The people go forward and overcome the enemy, the Amorite. In verse 24, "Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong. And Israel took all these cities, and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, at Heshbon, and in all its dependent villages" @Numbers 21:24,25. Typically, we see the believer who goes forward and takes possessions. It is our privilege to *dwell* in the conquered territory.
-- Are we going to reach the ground of the Spirit?
-- We are advancing.
{94}
-- All these conflicts are written "in the book of the wars of Jehovah" @Numbers 21:14. That is important, is it not?
-- There is "the book of the wars of Jehovah" (@Numbers 21:14) and that which "the poets say: <br>Come to Heshbon; let the city of Sihon be built and established. <br>For there went forth fire from Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon; it consumed Ar of Moab, the lords of the high places of the Arnon. <br>Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, people of Chemosh: <br>He gave his sons that had escaped, and his daughters into captivity to Sihon the king of the Amorites. <br>And we have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon; and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba" @Numbers 21:27 - 30.
There is the book of the conflicts of Jehovah and also what the poets say; these are spiritual references. We are now on military lines, and we are not discouraged; we sing, for there is nothing mournful. What the poets say is a triumph. We begin to make our collection of songs.
-- Does each one make his collection?
-- These details might appear insignificant, but they are given according to divine wisdom. The war is not finished; we are dwelling in our enemies¬ country; but we sing. Such is the military situation. And the war continues.
-- We are already conquerors and the poets compose their songs.
-- Their faces are always turned towards the sunrising (verse 11). They do not follow the setting sun.
-- I believe that all that we have just been saying is connected with what we read in Romans 8. In the epistle to the Romans it is a question of victory.
-- It is no longer Moses needing to have his hands supported; but Joshua goes forward.
{95}
-- We are moving in that direction. It is not yet Joshua who leads. For the moment, it is rather spiritual power that is in view. In the book of Numbers, Joshua is definitely chosen. Moses prayed Jehovah to set a man over the assembly to lead the people and bring them in; Jehovah answered him, "Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and thou shalt lay thy hand upon him" @Numbers 27:18. *A man who has the Spirit*, that is the outstanding thought! In the book of Numbers, from chapter 21, the people is considered spiritually. For example, in Balaam's prophecies, the people is regarded as in power. "He hath as it were the strength of a buffalo" (@Numbers 23:22) and "the shout of a king is in his midst" @Numbers 23:21. The book of Numbers deals with a people who has typically received the Spirit; it is what Israel does. When we come to the book of Joshua, it is Christ as Leader of the armies of Jehovah. In @Romans 8, the thought is what the Spirit is in the believer. The result of all that we have considered is that the youngest believer wakes up to the realisation that he has this great power within himself, so that he has a living part in all that is of God.
-- That part is even that of the "little children".
-- They had "the unction from the Holy One" @1 John 2:20.

THE ANOINTING
@2 Corinthians 1:21,22; @1 John 2:20,26,27; @1 Corinthians 12:12,13
These passages speak of a divine anointing, and no other anointing has any value. In pouring His anointing upon men, God intends to clothe them with dignity.
From the outset of God's ways toward men, it speaks of those who were anointed. The thought extends to a period which existed before the creation of man. In the book of Ezekiel, it speaks of a creature who is without doubt Satan. It says of him that he was "the anointed cherub" (@Ezekiel 28:14); but he did not keep this dignity: his heart was lifted up because of his beauty, and he fell. But God had in mind that the idea of the anointing was to be seen in Christ. However, before the Lord Jesus appeared as Man, God made use of the principle of anointing; but from the outset, Christ was before Him, for it was in Him that the moral qualities appeared which alone were worthy to be anointed. It is good to notice that, in the gospels, the Lord's feet were anointed by the women, before His head. The anointing that took place in the house of Simon the Pharisee precedes the anointing that took place in the house of Simon the leper. His feet were qualified by a holy walk; moral qualities come to light in the walk. The Lord had trodden this earth for thirty years before being anointed by God. In saluting Him from the heavens, at His baptism, the divine voice was heard, saying, "*Thou* art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight" @Luke 3:22. God had sought what He now found. The divine eye had, so to speak, scrutinised the walk of men. David says in a Psalm, "*Thou* knowest my down-sitting and mine uprising, thou understandest
{97}
my thought afar off; Thou searchest out my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways" @Psalm 139:2,3. He was conscious that God scrutinised his life. But in no man had God found His delight until the feet of the Lord left their blessed marks on this earth. For thirty years the life of Jesus was holy and complete devotedness. At the end of those thirty years, the Lord is found identified with the remnant. The Lord says, "It becometh us to fulfil all righteousness" @Matthew 3:15. Formerly, there had been seen in men features of righteousness, but here is the One who now fulfils all righteousness down here! When He comes out of the waters of baptism He prays; and when He prays, the heavens are opened upon Him, and the divine voice is heard coming from heaven: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight" @Matthew 3:17. Also, in bodily form as a dove, the Holy Spirit descends upon Him, and it is in the dignity of that anointing that He stands up in the synagogue of Nazareth. He takes the book and reads it. That book had never been read with such dignity. The passage that He read was taken from the prophet Isaiah, and was quite appropriate to the situation: "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He has anointed me to preach glad tidings to the poor; he has sent me to preach to captives deliverance, and to the blind sight, to send forth the crushed delivered, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord" @Luke 4:18,19. In this passage we have the divine example of ministry, the anointed Vessel for preaching. We see therefore how moral qualifications in view of anointing preceded the anointing itself. In this same gospel of Luke, a certain sense of the grace that was in Jesus led a poor sinner to recognise the moral qualities of the Lord: she anointed His feet -- she anointed them with myrrh. She would refresh His feet with her tears, but having wiped them with her hair, she anointed them with myrrh; she was
{98}
conscious that His feet were suffering and that they were going to suffer again.
I said that the principle of anointing appeared from the outset of God's ways toward man. I believe it is spoken of for the first time in connection with Abraham. It does not say that he was formally anointed, but Psalm 105 links the idea with Abraham. "Touch not mine anointed ones, and do my prophets no harm" @Psalm 105:15. We see that, from the outset, God had recourse to the idea of anointing, and in anointing men He committed Himself to them, and protected them: "Touch not mine anointed ones, and do my prophets no harm" @Psalm 105:15. The dignity of which I have spoken is seen with the patriarchs. There is a certain dignity with man according to flesh, but true divine dignity depends on the anointing, and we find it in a man like Jacob who, at the end of his days, acknowledges his serious failures; nevertheless, he is greater than the greatest monarch of the world; outwardly he was a Syrian ready to perish -- a shepherd in the eyes of the Egyptians; but inwardly he was greater than Pharaoh, for, "beyond all gainsaying, the inferior is blessed by the better" @Hebrews 7:7. In what was he better? In that Jacob was anointed. He had faith, and without faith there is no anointing; but it is in the anointing that all dignity rests. The great principle of the anointing having been established, we find it developed in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. And in presenting Christ in outward poverty in this world, God would establish all things in divine dignity.
So we find that Aaron was anointed, with the whole tabernacle system. You see how God desires that every detail of His world should be marked by the anointing. Aaron was anointed with oil, and also the whole tabernacle. Later on, king David is anointed. And God would have us pay attention to the vessel He uses for the anointing: it was a
{99}
horn. When Saul was anointed (@1 Samuel 10:1), Samuel took a vial of oil; the vessel containing the oil was like a bottle, of human manufacture. While David was anointed with Samuel's horn (@1 Samuel 16:1); the horn is something which grows of itself, showing the strength and beauty of the creature. This undoubtedly has reference to the death of our Lord Jesus Christ, for man could not be anointed apart from the death of our Lord Jesus Christ. The anointing oil typifies the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is given as a consequence of the death of our Lord Jesus Christ. That ought to touch our hearts. If I am clothed with dignity, Christ had first to suffer. Now note that the king is anointed after the priest; and afterwards the prophet is anointed. These are the three great official features attaching to Christ: the priest, the king and the prophet. In these three offices is manifested the dignity of Christ: we have part in the priesthood; we have part in the royalty of Christ; we have part in prophetic ministry. The dignity of the anointing is seen in each of these features. No one can be a priest unless he has the Spirit of Christ. No one can rule, if he has not the Spirit of the King. None can prophesy, save one who has the Spirit of Jesus, "for the Spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus" @Revelation 19:10.
Having said enough as to this precious subject, I would like to show you how it is introduced in relation to believers of the present dispensation. The apostle Paul says, "He that ... has anointed us is God". It is a question of Him who does it. Men are appointed to different positions in this world, but who anointed them? Who has the right to anoint them? Who can confer dignity upon them? Only God. So we have this remarkable word: "He that ... has anointed us is God". In that passage (@2 Corinthians 1) it speaks of the Spirit in three different ways: firstly, He is the anointing; secondly,
{100}
He is the seal; thirdly, He is the earnest in our hearts. The first aspect presents divine dignity and depends on the other two aspects; that is to say, I am conscious of belonging to God. I know that I belong to God by reason of His rights in creation and of His rights in redemption. But, by the seal of the Spirit, I am conscious of being God's, and I refuse to belong to other masters. Beloved, it is a very precious thing to be conscious of being God's. There is yet another thing; that is what I have for my own heart; He has given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts. My heart possesses *something*; I have in my heart the earnest of all that God has for me. In possessing the earnest, I am conscious of all that God *has* for me, and of all that He *is* for me. I am, therefore, set up, so to speak, independently of all that is in the world. I have means to maintain me -- means by which the dignity of the anointing is supported.
What I have just said are general remarks connected with the gift of the Spirit to the believer. But in the first epistle of John, we have the anointing (or unction) in relation to intelligence -- that is in the presence of antichrist. In our days it is necessary to be fortified against the attacks of antichristian teaching; theological schools, professors¬ chairs, modern books are full of antichristian doctrines; the minds of the young are corrupted by this teaching which makes pretence of being superior to every other teaching that went before. It may be superior in the mind of those who receive it, but the unction preserves us from its attacks. Having the unction, we deny that this teaching is superior; we are conscious of the superiority of the truth. John says that we have received an unction: "*Ye* have the unction from the holy one, and ye know all things" @1 John 2:20. We who have received this unction have proved the superiority of Christianity. The things that men are
{101}
busy searching out and analysing, we know already; they are seeking the origin of man, and say that it is unknown; they pursue their researches, while Ecclesiastes tells us that man is known. Speaking of our Lord Jesus it says that He knew all men, and we have no need of other research. The truth is known: we who have the unction *know* we know that the truth has been proclaimed, and we can regard with disdain what men consider to be superior. The Lord said to Nicodemus, "I have said the earthly things to you" (@John 3:12) -- all the earthly things were well known to Him. The Lord Jesus knows all about the physical creation, for He created all things. He knows all about us. Men on earth pretend to know, but what do they know as to what is in heaven? It says, "No one has gone up into heaven, save he who came down out of heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven" (@John 3:13), and He it is who knows what is in heaven. Thus, knowing the Lord Jesus Christ, we have the knowledge of all things on earth and in the heavens. Possessing the Holy Spirit come down from heaven, we have the means of knowing all things. It is said that the Holy Spirit in us knows all things. The possession of the Spirit of God as unction renders us independent of men, and gives us a dignity in that independence. I am not a religious man, but I am clothed with dignity in the position that I have. Such is the believer anointed by God!
The apostle says "These things have I written to you concerning those who lead you astray: and *yourselves*, the unction which ye have received from him abides in you" @1 John 2:26,27. The Holy Spirit is given to us permanently, for He "abides in you". The young believer is thus protected because he is conscious of the presence of the unction; this blessed unction is present with us when we read and meditate on the word at home. It is the Holy Spirit who sheds light; we are thus enveloped in
{102}
light, and we see all things as they are. He is with us when we read the Scriptures together; we read them then with dignity, respect and reverence; He speaks to our hearts; He is in us as those who compose the temple of God. The light comes from one brother after another when we are gathered together, and we are thus superior to man whose understanding is darkened and his future uncertain. "We know", says John. Those who have the unction know the truth. They know.
Now, before closing, I wish to show you how that is developed in relation to collective dignity, in @1 Corinthians 12:12,13. "So also is the Christ". The expression refers to the saints in their collective relations. It is not a question here of Christ personally, but it is Christ seen in the saints in a collective way. In verse 13, "For also in the power of one Spirit *we* have all been baptised into one body". As being "*baptised*", we are all one: we cease to be individuals; we are maintained in living relation the one with the other. The figure the apostle uses is that of the human body -- an organism; all the members in the body fulfil their different functions. Then, it says that we "have all been *given to drink* of one Spirit". Someone else had to baptise me. The baptism of the Spirit is by the Lord Jesus. As to baptism with water, it is never said that the Lord Jesus Christ baptised anyone: "Jesus himself did not baptise, but his disciples" @John 4:2. Many saints have been able to baptise others, but Jesus alone baptises with the Holy Spirit. We have all been baptised in the power of one Spirit. But then, I must drink, myself; no one can do it for me. Thus, for the satisfaction of my heart, I am given to drink of the blessed Spirit of God. That is a reality, dear brethren. All those who are conscious of being part of the body have tasted the blessedness of it. The divine intention is that there is to be a vessel down here for divine
{103}
service and testimony. That is what should be seen in every locality where there are children of God, as it existed at Corinth. There were Jews, Greeks and the assembly of God.
I enter the synagogue. What do I find there? Much pretension, but no light. There is no unction.
I go to the Greeks. What do I find there? They gathered at Areopagus to hear something new, what the newspapers announce to men, for Areopagus was like an exchange: but what were these new things that took place on earth? What wicked men were doing: murders, deaths, marriages, births. Is there any unction there? No, there is nothing marked by dignity; it does not rise above flesh.
I enter the assembly at Corinth. What do I find there? The saints are gathered together, the word of God is read; there is a true ministry; I am conscious of the presence of God; I am above the level of men; God is there by the Spirit. The unction is there, dear brethren. At Corinth, God has a vessel -- the assembly -- a vessel capable of reflecting heaven; and if I look at the dear brethren in their houses, I see that the husbands are the heads, that the wives are subject, that the children are dependent on their parents, that the Spirit operates, that there is a reflection of the Lord. You see the dignity that attaches to it. "So also is the Christ".
I have nothing to add. I commend to you the idea of a vessel in a locality, a vessel in the possession of the Spirit of God to display the dignity and order of His house and as testimony in all its forms.

"THE LIGHT IS SWEET"
@Ecclesiastes 11:7 - 10; @Ecclesiastes 12:1,2
I desire to draw your attention to the subject of the light that has shone out through the preaching.
The preaching is the means God uses to spread the light. The gospel according to Mark is the gospel which gives light concerning the preaching, and it says at the end of that gospel that the Lord sat at the right hand of God. Having died for our sins and been raised by the power of God, He "sat at the right hand of God" @Mark 16:19. It says that the disciples, going forth, preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs following upon it. The Lord worked with them by signs. The words of the preachers were therefore confirmed by the signs. So, in that gospel, it is said that the word was to be preached to all the creation: "Go into all the world, and preach the glad tidings to all the creation" @Mark 16:15. Paul says that indeed the glad tidings have been proclaimed in the whole creation. The light, then, has shone very specially in Europe. By Paul the preaching has been fully known. As to the Lord Jesus it is said, "Coming, he has preached the glad tidings of peace to you who were afar off, and the glad tidings of peace to those who were nigh" @Ephesians 2:17.
The light has been shed abroad -- the light that God commanded and that shines in the face of Jesus Christ in heaven: it has shone in the hearts of men to give the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, and that light has shone so clearly that, if any one does not believe by that light, he is lost, the god of this world having blinded his eyes so that the light of the glory of the glad tidings should not shine for him. However, this light shines for
{105}
all; but he whose heart is blinded by the god of this world does not benefit by that light.
The book, from which I have read a passage, was written by a preacher. It says that he was "king in Jerusalem" (@Ecclesiastes 1:1); he therefore had the means and was in a position to be accessible to men. Occupying the position of a king, he had the right of way, as our Lord Jesus Christ has the right to enter in everywhere: being exalted to the right hand of God, He has a right to all parts of the earth. So he has allowed the light to spread everywhere by means of the preaching. Paul said, "I, from Jerusalem, and in a circuit round to Illyricum, have fully preached the glad tidings of the Christ" @Romans 15:19.
That light spread in the east, and it shines today that all may get the benefit of it. The whole western region also profits by this light, commercially and socially. Men speak approvingly of the light of the gospel, without having appropriated it for their own salvation. It says in Ecclesiastes, "The light is sweet, and pleasant is it to the eyes to see the sun". We all know how great is the difference between the countries where the light shines and the pagan countries; but it may be that we approve the light, and that we are living in this world as if the light did not exist. Thousands of men are enjoying the benefits of this light, but it has not affected them as before God, for the object of the light is to expose men in the presence of God. The light having shone into Paul's soul, he made the confession that he was the first of sinners and said, "Faithful is the word, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the first" @1 Timothy 1:15. The light brought about repentance in his soul, and he obtained the pardon of his sins, and the gift of the Holy Spirit; he was saved, as he had occasion to say, "Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house" @Acts 16:31.
{106}
Here, it is written, "The light is sweet". A man may speak of the light with approval; but he may at the same time follow a path of sin and forget God, in this world. So, dear friends, we are recommended to remember "the days of darkness; for they shall be many". It is said to the young man that he may walk in the ways of his heart, and in the sight of his eyes, but he is to remember that for all these things God will bring him into judgment.
I had the intention to say a few words to the young who are here this afternoon. The preacher speaks of the vanity of childhood and youth. In childhood and youth we look towards the world and seek the things of the world. Death appears to us to be a very long way off, for we think we must become old to die; but there is a large proportion of men who die in youth. It is not necessary to become old to die; many die in youth, hence the word: "Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth", instead of putting off decision for Christ till the "evil days". You must seize the present opportunity. "Behold, now is the well-accepted time; behold, now the day of salvation" @2 Corinthians 6:2. Nobody knows what tomorrow will bring forth; it might not be the acceptable time, the day of salvation. It speaks here of a time when "the sun, and the light, and the moon, and the stars" will be darkened. Think of what that will be, in a physical sense, when the sun, the moon and the stars will be darkened! But it will be the same in a moral sense, for this era of grace is drawing to its close. The sun will be darkened. That does not mean that the Lord Jesus will no longer shine. As before, He will always shine in heaven, but the beneficent rays of His grace, the beams which shine in His face, will be withdrawn from the earth. Then there will be no more preaching of the gospel. Think, dear friends, what such darkness will be! The moon typifies the assembly. It is the assembly that reflects the
{107}
light that shines in the face of Jesus. The moon will be darkened, for the assembly will be withdrawn from this earth and transported to heaven. Do we really believe that the Lord Jesus will come to translate the assembly? He will come, and when the assembly has been translated the moon will be darkened. The moon is still shining, though obscured on account of failure, but the light that shines, shines in the assembly. It is shed upon you, young people, through your believing parents, through the brethren and all believers. But who knows if that will not have ceased before tomorrow? Not a single star will shine. The stars refer to Christians individually. In almost every part of the world there are isolated believers who themselves also shine, reflecting the light of the sun.
John was shining in Patmos, beloved. He was isolated, but he was shining. He reflected the light of Christ in heaven; and one day it was said to him, "Come up here" @Revelation 4:1. A voice was addressed to this isolated Christian, and told him to come up to heaven: that will be the case with each isolated believer. We shall be all carried away to heaven, and the light which shines through us will cease.
Will you run the risk of being left in darkness? Not only will the luminaries be darkened, but there will be miracles, signs and lying wonders, "because they have not received the love of the truth that they might be saved" @2 Thessalonians 2:10. The truth is spread, but men do not receive it in love. They are going to believe a lie. That is very solemn!
I would like to say to each of the young ones here: "Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth, before the evil days come". The true light now shines. What condemns men is that the light has come, and they have preferred darkness. Most of those here love the light. We say, "The light is sweet", but by that light we are judged. We have confessed our
{108}
sins; we have believed on Jesus; we have received forgiveness. Think of the blessedness of being forgiven by God! I am forgiven. I know it through the light.
We desire that you yourselves may enter into the light, while it shines, for "the true light" (@1 John 2:8) shines *now*.
Preaching by J.T. at Beauvoisin, 9th May, 1926, afternoon.
{109}
PAUL'S LIGHT
@Isaiah 60:1 - 3; @Ephesians 1:3 - 6; @Ephesians 5:7 - 14
-- I have the thought of following up the subject of light. Light is necessarily introduced into all God's operations. Before giving creation its present form, He said, "Let there be light" @Genesis 1:3.
I would like to show you the special character of the light in which the assembly is established, which involves Paul's ministry. The Jews in general had received light, but in the case of Paul we see degrees of comparison with regard to the light. First it speaks of it as *a light out of heaven*; then, as *a great light*; and finally, as *a light above the brightness of the sun*; there was a special significance in that, indicating what was going to be presented to the saints through Paul. John speaks of light perhaps more than any other apostle, but he does not speak of it as a light out of heaven; John speaks rather of the true light, which coming into the world, lightens every man. John insists on its universal character; it is not partial. When it is a question of Paul, we receive what we might call *our own* light. @Isaiah 60 gives the idea, but that passage applies to the Jewish remnant at Jerusalem in the future. There will come a moment when the light of Israel will shine. Previously, for a moment, great darkness will cover the earth; but God will intervene on behalf of the remnant of Israel at Jerusalem. There will be an outshining of light for them through Christ. It says, "Jehovah shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen on thee". It is not a light that will shine directly for the people of the nations; they will walk in that light, but through Israel.
-- The Jewish remnant is distinguished by the fact that the light will arise upon them.
{110}
-- I read this passage from Isaiah in view of the thought of a *special* light; there will be a moment of deep darkness on the earth; but the glory of Jehovah will shine upon the Jewish remnant at Jerusalem, and so the remnant will have a place of supremacy on the earth. Now, the light that has come through Paul corresponds to that light; that is to say it is a special light for the assembly. It is distinguished as being a light out of heaven. It shone round about Paul and those who were with him: those who were with Paul saw that light. Then, later, he speaks of it as *a great light*: "There suddenly shone out of heaven a great light round about me" @Acts 22:6. And finally, speaking to king Agrippa, he says that it was "*a light above the brightness of the sun*" @Acts 26:13. The spiritual suggestion of this last expression is that that light delivers us from all human light: every other light is eclipsed by that light. This light is communicated to us in the epistle to the Ephesians. One finds that, in a general way, brethren have only a poor appreciation of what is particularly ours -- our special light. It says, "*Thy* light is come". It is a question of shining in *our* light.
-- "Wake up, thou that sleepest, and arise up from among the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee".
-- The light that shines upon the saints who wake up is, so to speak, Ephesian light, and I have thought that the revival of the truth which has taken place in the last century, bears this character: our light has been recovered. From that time, the object of the enemy has always been to deprive us of that heavenly light, and I believe many believers would be content with a place in the millennium; but that is not *our* light.
-- That will be the portion of the remnant.
-- We shall also have our part in the millennium, but our part will be a heavenly part. The assembly
{111}
will be seen coming down out of the heaven from God, her light like a most precious stone.
-- As a crystal-like jasper stone.
-- That heavenly light is already brought in now. In Ephesians it not only says that we are in the light, but that we are "light in the Lord".
-- Christ is the light that illuminates the city.
-- It says that "the city has no need of the sun nor of the moon, that they should shine for it; for the glory of God has enlightened it, and the lamp thereof is the Lamb" @Revelation 21:23. It has no need of natural light.
-- Her light is most precious, "like a most precious stone, as a crystal-like jasper stone" @Revelation 21:11.
-- The city is composed of sons of light.
-- They are sons of God, according to this passage from Ephesians. It is this blessed relationship that gives the assembly its special character.
-- And it comes down out of the heaven from God.
-- The revelation of God might be called a general light that shines for all, and John speaks of it from that side: fellowship is in that light.
-- It says, "If we walk in the light as *he* is in the light, we have fellowship with one another" @1 John 1:7.
-- Fellowship existed already before the introduction of Paul's ministry: we find fellowship in the second chapter of the Acts; it is the "fellowship of the apostles" @Acts 2:42.
-- John alludes to it in his epistle, when he says, "Our fellowship is indeed with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ" @1 John 1:3.
-- Paul in no wise set aside what existed already; but he introduced additional light. So, speaking of the Lord's supper, he said that he had received it directly from the Lord; and the subsequent light brought in in Paul's ministry is connected specially with the Lord's supper. Paul's ministry maintained the sovereignty of God, but in no wise set aside the ministry of John. The ministry of Paul links everything
{112}
with heaven, so that the Gentiles were not led to what was established at Jerusalem. Two things had taken place before Cornelius received the light; first the light had come from heaven and had shone round about Paul and his company (Acts 9), and then a sheet had come out of heaven and was taken up again into heaven; Acts 10. Now it was after these great events that Peter was sent to Cornelius, so that we are introduced into something greater than that which existed at Jerusalem.
-- It is of all importance to see what it is into which we, of the nations, have been brought.
-- Would it be the same thought, when it says, "Ye have come to mount Zion" @Hebrews 12:22?
-- That would be the same character.
-- In chapter 12 of Hebrews you have the whole range of all that exists before God, now already, including the assembly of the first-born whose names are written in the heavens; we have come to the light of all that. What is to be noticed is that we, Gentiles, have been brought into *the greatest* light. The day of Pentecost was a wonderful day, but the system into which Cornelius and his company were introduced was still greater. In the fifteenth chapter of Luke, it speaks of the prodigal son, and it says that the *best robe* was brought out.
-- That is something more than Pentecost.
-- In the fourteenth chapter of Luke we have the great supper; that is Pentecost. There was the house, and the house had to be filled. What is in view there is simply a place in the house, but chapter 15 goes further than that. In chapter 14 it is not said that the Father ran to meet repentant sons; the servant goes right and left seeking the poor, maimed, etc.; but chapter 15 shows us what a reception awaited the Gentiles, for "while he was yet a long way off, his father saw him" @Luke 15:20. Now, that is in
{113}
view in the epistle to the Ephesians which shows what is our portion.
-- "Wake up, thou that sleepest, and arise up from among the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee".
-- If the sleeping Christian wakes up, it is in the midst of this marvellous light that shines. When the Father saw the prodigal afar off he ran to meet him. Nothing can compare with that.
-- Then a Christian may be asleep.
-- And how many are asleep in our days! But this word is addressed to us; and if one is recovered, it is to the greatest light, so that nothing is comparable with the reception of the returned prodigal. The prodigal is ourselves, those of the nations. Then, before the prodigal is received, Peter had to be specially prepared; and it is heaven that undertakes that preparation. Peter is therefore carefully prepared, in order that the prodigal should be suitably received; @Acts 10.
-- He goes up to the housetop he falls into an ecstasy, and a vision comes to him he sees all kinds of beasts. As Peter would not eat anything, the voice told him not to call unclean what God had cleansed.
-- It was "a certain vessel descending, as a great sheet" @Acts 10:11.
-- It is a question of something that comes down out of heaven. The origin of the assembly is heaven.
-- The character of the family is according to its greatest light: "Arise, shine! for thy light is come".
-- The epistle to the Ephesians governs this situation for us. Peter had to be carefully prepared in order that the prodigal -- Cornelius -- might be received in a suitable manner. So Peter preaches in the house of Cornelius, and while he is preaching, the Holy Spirit falls on all those who were listening to the word.
-- That corresponds to the Father who ran to meet the prodigal and covered him with kisses.
-- He is submerged in love.
{114}
-- That is the reception given to those of the nations!
-- It is as if God would show in every way how happy He was to see the Gentiles return. Then, He clothes these Gentiles with the best robe.
-- "And I will clothe her priests with salvation" @Psalm 132:16. Is that the thought?
-- That is the thought indeed. No one can fulfil the function of a priest without being righteous. Think of the best robe with which we are clothed!
-- You have said that it is necessary to be righteous. The fine linen represents the righteousnesses of the saints. That is what is produced from day to day by the Holy Spirit. But the best robe was already in the Father's house. There is only one "best robe". It is made of what is best; our calling is heavenly. That is what we must lay hold of! That is to say that in entering heaven you are perfectly at ease. The assembly is clothed with this robe that no other family can ever wear.
-- Each one should take the thought to himself, since it is the portion of all. It is Paul's light.
-- Is that the idea, in @Romans 13:14 "Put on the Lord Jesus Christ"?
-- There, it is rather the Christian profession, but here it is something more. In Romans it is a question of the Lord Jesus Christ and of your position down here; but in Ephesians it is more elevated, which we must understand. In Luke, the robe is *the best*. This explains the beginning of the epistle to the Ephesians, when the apostle says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ". However numerous the blessings are, they are all ours, but they are all given in the heavenlies, and at the outset of the epistle you have: "Having marked us out beforehand for adoption through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the
{115}
good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has taken us into favour in the Beloved". Think of all the affection connected with this favour into which we are brought! The prodigal is clothed with all the divine thoughts of love. Not only are we taken into favour, but "taken into favour in the Beloved" -- the strongest expression conceivable of Christ's place before the Father. Think of the place we have in the divine affections!
-- "*The* best robe", "*the* Beloved" -- these expressions are in the singular; it is unique.
-- But it is absolutely necessary that each takes the Place of the prodigal.
-- I understand the expression 'bring out' as involving the ministry of Paul. You have the prodigal; he is there, covered with kisses: that is chapter 10 of the Acts. Chapter 11 introduces Paul into his active service: he sets out and goes to Antioch where he spends a whole year. In chapter 13 he is sent further to preach, and in his ministry the best robe is brought out. In result, the saints are clothed with the thoughts of divine and eternal love.
-- All saints are included. The epistle to the Ephesians embraces all believers, Jews and Gentiles.
-- The robe was within, but he brought it out by his ministry.
-- The Lord had already appeared to Paul and He was going to appear to him again later.
-- "Things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that love him", (@1 Corinthians 2:9) that is what God has revealed to us by His Spirit!
-- The light goes on growing.
-- God had hidden these deep things by Him. First, He brings in Paul through that light out of heaven. Then, the sheet comes down out of heaven to Peter. Peter goes to Cornelius and receives him with the greatest affection. Then Paul begins his
{116}
ministry, and there are successive waves of light; the eternal thoughts of God concerning the assembly are developed one after another. In chapter 2 of Ephesians, we arrive at quite a definite point. Our light is come -- quickened, raised, made to sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus. The assembly is to shine in that light.
-- That is why, in Revelation, Ephesus is first; she had been set up in that precious light, and it was a question of her reflecting it.
-- That is a subjective thought, is it not?
-- This light is developed by Paul, to the end that it should be developed in us; so that in chapter 5 this responsibility is placed upon us: "Walk as children of light". Verse 14 is a quotation from Isaiah; the appeal is addressed to all those who compose the assembly, that they may awake and arise and shine, because "thy light is come".

SPIRITUAL INITIATIVE (1)
@Judges 6:7 - 40
-- We have here an example of divine intervention in answer to a felt need. The need was felt generally, but the intervention related to a certain locality. Two principles therefore are found side by side: what is general and what is local. The general exercise is in verse 7: "The children of Israel cried to Jehovah because of Midian". Then the prophet is sent in relation to that general exercise. The need that was felt was a general need, and the prophet brings the thoughts of God in a general way. The angel of Jehovah comes into a certain locality, to Ophrah. If a divine representative comes into a locality, it is in relation to all that is of God in that locality. Then, there is a question that should exercise those who are of the locality: in what state is he going to find them? It says, "An angel of Jehovah came and sat under the terebinth that was in Ophrah". The fact that the angel sat indicates careful discernment; being seated, the angel was watching all those who were in the locality, taking account of all. Thus, not knowing when we ourselves might have such a visitation, we should all do well to be on the alert. Gideon was well occupied; he "threshed wheat in the wine-press". It was a region of vineyards; but he had an unusual occupation, for he was threshing wheat in the wine-press, "to secure it from the Midianites". That is to say, he was aware of the enemy's efforts at that moment. It says that the Midianites "destroyed the produce of the land" @Judges 6:4. A brother who is with God can discern the general attacks of the enemy, and what exercises him is to meet his attacks, and preserve the saints from them. Gideon had no thought of being a pre-eminent
{118}
servant, but he was occupied with what was of the highest importance at that moment. If we see the efforts of the enemy, we shall try to meet them, according to our measure, obviously. Gideon knew how to thresh wheat, and he used the wine-press, which was not intended for that, in order that the food, being hidden from the enemies, should not be destroyed. Like Gideon, each brother in his own locality can do something.
-- Gideon was a man who felt the state of things in Israel, each one can be in that state of exercise before God.
-- The Lord always considers us; He takes account in a special way of those who are occupied with something. It may be that I am not very capable, but I see what the enemy is doing and I do what I can to protect the saints from the enemy's attacks.
-- Can we say that affection for the people of God marked Gideon?
-- Yes. He is introduced as being occupied with a very necessary work. The wheat must be preserved.
-- The wheat indeed has a meaning, has it not?
-- It is the principal part of the food in all countries. It says in @Psalm 104:15, "With bread he strengtheneth man's heart". Wine gladdens his heart, but bread strengthens his heart. We cannot be satisfied with wine until we have bread. In this Psalm the bread precedes the wine (@Psalm 104:14,15).
-- Bread is the first food of man.
-- Christ is the bread of God come down out of heaven, and unless the truth of the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ is maintained among the saints, there can be no growth with them. Gideon was occupied with the primary thought of bread. He was occupied with a process which had in view to separate the grain from the chaff. Other services would be necessary to make it into food that could be eaten; it must
{119}
be ground and kneaded and put in the oven. We see a young man without reputation who is occupied with what is most essential for the moment. He represents a young brother or a young sister who understands in a general way the needs of the saints in a locality, who understands the general attacks of the enemy, and who does all he can to counter his attacks. The enemy's attack is very serious. Instead of saying, I can do nothing, for it needs a more able man than I, Gideon sets to work.
-- He has individual exercises in relation to the whole company.
-- Every young brother should learn, but the important question is: Have I some little spiritual initiative? One might say, I have no gift; the Lord has not sent me. But it is a matter of doing what my hand finds to do: "Whatever thy hand findeth to do, do with thy might" @Ecclesiastes 9:10. You will see that men whom God uses in His service are those who begin themselves. When you start on the right road, the Lord is with you. There is an illustration of it in the second book of Kings, chapter 2. Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal. The movement begins with Elisha, but then Elijah takes the initiative. "Elijah said to Elisha, Abide here, I pray thee; for Jehovah has sent me to Bethel" (@2 Kings 2:2); but first of all, Elijah went *with Elisha* from Gilgal. There was with that young man a spiritual movement. Then Elijah, who typifies the Lord Jesus, is with him in that movement. At one point after another Elisha is tested to show if that spiritual energy is maintained. I take a step; the Lord goes with me, and encourages me to go still further. But those whom the Lord uses in His service take the initiative themselves. My qualification for service is seen in that I begin from the outset in this way. Thus, instead of letting my hands hang down, I say, This work is to be done, and so far as it is within my power, I am going to do it.
{120}
-- Paul said to Timothy, "Remembering thy tears" @2 Timothy 1:4.
-- You will see that in every case where God uses men, they have taken the initiative. It is so with Moses; an Egyptian was smiting a Hebrew; then he intervened and saved the Hebrew; the next day it is two Hebrews who are quarrelling and he would set them at peace. He takes the initiative himself, not having received his mission from God -- a mission which was committed to him forty years later.
One could quote other examples. It is a principle. It is to be noticed that in the gospels, Peter and John and the others were occupied in their legitimate callings; in one case they were washing their nets; in another, they were mending their nets. So, like Gideon, one does, with his might, what his hand finds to do. The angel of Jehovah salutes him, saying, "Jehovah is with thee, thou mighty man of valour". How honoured he was by that salutation! You began that way, Mr. L.?
-- Gideon had no idea of being a mighty man of valour.
-- He was doing a very ordinary thing, but his object was to overcome the enemy. It is specified that it was "to secure it from the Midianites". He might have been lazy and hidden the wheat without threshing it, but it was much better to thresh it and reduce it.
-- When Gideon replies to this salutation, he says, "Ah my Lord, if Jehovah be with us, why then is all this befallen us?" He identifies himself with the people; it is very beautiful.
-- One cannot separate oneself from the people, can one?
-- To separate oneself from the people would show pride; the state of the people is our own responsibility. Gideon was much honoured in the very fact that the angel of Jehovah appeared to him.
{121}
-- He was with the people in a difficult moment.
-- He was identified in an active way. The great point is that my hand does what it finds to do. The verses which follow show us that he had much to learn; but he did not have to learn to thresh the wheat. He knew how to thresh the wheat, and he threshed it.
-- That is a good lesson for each of us.
-- May each one be led to ask himself, As to myself, what am I doing? Is there anything that I can do? If I do not do what I can do, there is failure with me, and the Lord takes account of it. The Lord said, with regard to the woman in chapter 14 of Mark, "What *she* could she has done" @Mark 14:8.
-- We have here, in Gideon, a man who identifies himself entirely with the people; he says, "us", and not 'me'. We must have in our heart that which the Lord has in His heart, the assembly, otherwise one will only act for oneself.
-- In verse 26 of the previous chapter, Jael put her hand to the tent-pin. She took what was available.
-- That is a good thought. She did what she could. What Gideon said was quite right (verse 13): "If Jehovah be with us, why then is all this befallen us?" It was a question which rightly expressed what was in Gideon's mind. What follows is beautiful: "And *Jehovah* looked upon him". It is no longer the angel. It is as though it were said, Here is a brother who ponders! He has not perhaps much light, but he ponders; that is what God loves, those who ponder over things. Then He answers him, "Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of Midian". It is what the man had. First, the angel of Jehovah addresses him as a "mighty man of valour". He was to go in his might, as if God would say to him, Thou must make use of thy might. Thus the experience of Gideon would be like that of
{122}
Paul when he said, "Of myself I will not boast, unless in my weaknesses" @2 Corinthians 12:5.
-- "Go in this thy might" -- What is this might?
-- That is to encourage Gideon. A young believer needs to be encouraged. God does not cast us back upon ourselves, but we must estimate at its right value the strength that we have. For Gideon, the might comes from Jehovah, who made heaven and earth. If God is with me, there are no limits to what can be accomplished. We have what God is going to use. If I have the Holy Spirit and have learnt to make use of Him (@Romans 8), I have power. "When I am weak, them I am powerful" @2 Corinthians 12:10. There is nothing to prove that Gideon was occupied with his own powers. He was not like one of those who say, "Here are we!" @Numbers 14:40. If I pretend to have might, I am no longer qualified. He was conscious of his weakness, and this weakness is the source of his might.
-- Does not this might show itself in Gideon's action at the beginning?
-- The wheat represents Christ, does it not?
-- Gideon made no pretension; he had sober thoughts as to himself. But Jehovah had said, "Go in this thy might, and thou shall save Israel from the hand of Midian. Have not I sent thee?"
-- He was typically a sober and intelligent brother who made use of the strength available to him.
-- He made no pretension.
-- If I live here, I take account of things as they exist generally; I see what the need is, and I act according to my capacity and according to the opportunities that present themselves. Generally, it is after this pattern that men whom God can use are presented. I believe that a brother's gift comes to light first of all in his own locality; then, he goes out in the district, and then into the whole country. The Lord began His service at Nazareth, where He was
{123}
brought up; then He visited the cities of Galilee; but in Luke He says, "I must needs announce the glad tidings of the kingdom of God to the other cities also", (@Luke 4:43) everywhere. What is essential is that I do not wait to receive help from elsewhere: I am going to make use myself of the strength God has given me. We can never say when, from an unexpected environment, God will raise up someone who will save Israel. A servant of the Lord, whom several of us knew, complained in his youth of the great needs of Christendom. Then, it was said to him, Improve the world by one man. In the case of Gideon, God intervenes and calls him "Mighty man of valour" It is good to see the intervention of God, but what am I doing in view of the needs of the locality?
-- The spirit of Timothy is the spirit of Gideon.
-- Exactly. He had a good report from the brethren among whom he lived before Paul used him. He had shed tears.
-- But he was also conscious of his weakness.
-- Jehovah said to Gideon, "I will certainly be with thee; and thou shalt smite Midian as one man". He had certain resources.
-- What were those resources?
-- He had not only the strength to thresh wheat, but he had something that he could bring to God. He was not an ordinary brother; he was secretly a priest. He would present something to God. Notice what he brings. He makes ready a kid and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour; he puts the flesh in a basket and the broth in a pot; he brings all under the terebinth and presents it. See what an indication we have here.
-- He is a priest, do you say?
-- And he has something to offer. That shows that, in a typical way and in secret, he had been feeding upon Christ. The kid and the unleavened cakes speak of the humanity of Christ. He puts the flesh
{124}
in a basket and the broth in a pot: he was a spiritual man. He had very humble thoughts with regard to himself, but he was a priest. He understood what was suitable to present to God. Then the Angel of God said to him, "Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth". He is now under divine direction. He has an experience which is entirely personal to himself, which will come out later in his ministry, but it is an occasion specially for him. "And the Angel of Jehovah put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. And the Angel of Jehovah departed out of his sight". His offering is accepted. Gideon typically is accepted in all the value of the offering. In the broth, it is a question of the essence of the humanity of Christ which is presented to God, which brings out the spiritual intelligence of Gideon. The Lord Jesus Christ become Man is presented in His infinite essence to God. At this point, the Angel of Jehovah departs. We see therefore what a wonderful occasion Gideon had, firstly in bringing the offering, and secondly in receiving divine directions as to its disposal. He had a unique personal experience; and there is no doubt that all those whom God uses have, in a certain measure, an experience of this kind. There will be a divine appearing, for God has His own way of making Himself known to us.
Reading with J.T. at Beauvoisin, 10th May, 1926, afternoon.
{125}
SPIRITUAL INITIATIVE (2)
@Judges 6:22 - 40
-- I intend to pursue the subject we had this afternoon. At the close of our meeting, we were occupied with Gideon's present. We remarked that he had by him the means of presenting an offering to God; he brought a kid and unleavened cakes. These things speak to us of the Lord Jesus Christ, as Man on earth, presented to God; the kid as being slain and presented speaks to us of the Lord put to death, and the broth relates to what He was essentially as known to God, and in a certain measure, to the believer; the ephah of flour, that is to say, a measured portion of flour, speaks to us of His perfect humanity, and Gideon was accepted in the value of these offerings -- the one would be the burnt-offering and the other the oblation. We were led to contemplate the priestly features in Gideon, for no brother, and no sister, can have power with men before having power with God. But there was still something lacking in Gideon's instruction: he did not know God revealed in love.
"And Gideon perceived that he was an angel of Jehovah; and Gideon said, Alas, Lord Jehovah! for because I have seen an angel of Jehovah face to face ...". In the presence of God, there ought not to be such an expression in the mouth of the servant: "Alas, Lord Jehovah!" The knowledge of God revealed in the death of Christ should dispel all that fear from us, for "perfect love casts out fear" @1 John 4:18. Fear produces torment, but perfect love casts out fear, and perfect love is witnessed in the death of Jesus. We should understand the death of Christ from that point of view. It is one thing to know
{126}
that I am accepted as Gideon was, and it is another thing to know what God is as revealed in the death of Christ; what God is in Christ is greater than what I am in Christ, although there is perfect correspondence between God revealed in Christ and my position in Christ. At that moment, Gideon needed to know perfect love. Jehovah said to him, "Peace be unto thee: fear not; thou shalt not die". There is a certain liberty in the soul of the one who knows God. Gideon's altar is erected in that light. An altar represents a definite progress in the soul; it is my public testimony to the knowledge of God that I possess. He called the altar Jehovah-Shalom. That is the light in which Jehovah had made Himself known to him: "Jehovah of peace". We arrive at a point that is very beautiful. I have no more fear in my soul with regard to God. All is adjusted with Him. God is known to me in His nature, and my heart is in perfect rest before Him.
-- Does this answer to the first verse of chapter 5 of Romans: "We have peace towards God through our Lord Jesus Christ" @Romans 5:1?
-- The beginning of chapter 5 of Romans is the complement of the end of chapter 4. After that, the soul can go forward without hindrance, and if tribulation comes it produces endurance; "and endurance experience; and experience hope; and hope does not make ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which has been given to us" @Romans 5:4,5. Perfect love is known in the heart by the Holy Spirit. I have no more fears, from that side. All that happens to me is in my favour. How many are there among us who possess this altar? This altar is characterised by peace -- "Jehovah of peace".
-- It is the privilege of all Christians.
-- And one who does not possess it is not in the full Christian position.
{127}
-- It is not a question only of possessing this altar, but of building it.
-- The name of the altar indicates the state of soul of the one who builds it. Here, it is "Jehovah of peace". It is his public worship of God known in that light. If any one comes to you and asks you what this altar means, you say it expresses the knowledge that you have of God, as Paul says, "My God shall abundantly supply all your need according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus" @Philippians 4:19. That indicates the altar that he himself had erected, for note that he does not say, 'our God', but "my God".
-- Abraham had his altar and his tent.
-- That is the same idea.
-- All that is experimental and personal.
-- Gideon had made progress. He is in public and definite relation with God. He has power with God. Now, what follows is the development of that power with men; for if we wish to help men, we must have moral power towards them. "And it came to pass the same night, that Jehovah said to him, Take the young bullock, which thy father hath, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the Asherah that is by it". What right had Gideon to do it? If it had been his bullock and his altar, he would not have needed moral power, but he did need it, so much the more as it concerned what was his father's. Gideon acts now on the principle of moral power. If I have not moral power I cannot take his bullock and throw down his altar. The verses that follow show that Gideon had moral power with his father, and in verse 31 his father is with him. That is the important point. Do I carry the brethren with me, so to speak, in all that I do? It is an immense thought. Before I can be successful in the testimony I must have moral power, and that power
{128}
flows from that which I have with God. I have noticed that if one prays for someone, among the brethren in the locality for example, we shall, at the suitable time, have power with regard to him, and the further we extend in our prayers, the more moral power we shall have.
-- It was in that power that Jacob was able to stand before Pharaoh.
-- Yes. He was a prince who had power with God and with men.
-- It is very beautiful to see how Gideon's father is entirely won.
-- There is something else that is of great importance: it is the second bullock (verse 26). I believe there may be a danger: that is that Gideon may be aware of the knowledge he possesses, and that God has taken him up on account of his personal valour. As we have already seen, it is true that God recognises the personal valour of a man. But we must not forget that those whom God uses He takes up according to His sovereignty, and each one in particular. The second bullock indicates that one has finished with what the first signifies. Therefore, God does not use me on the principle of nature; that which is natural comes first, that which is spiritual, second. So we have "the first man", and afterward "the second man".
-- What is the meaning of the Asherah?
-- Gideon used the wood of the Asherah. The wood represents that which had been in the service of Satan and is now in the service of God. After all, every creature of God is good.
-- Was it a public testimony against evil?
-- Yes. Gideon's education is very important for us. We are a little inclined to adorn ourselves with the power which, really, comes from God; that would mean that we do not offer the fat to God. The most useful servant, the one who is most successful, always
{129}
refers to God in relation to his power. There are therefore two things that go together in service: God recognises His own work in the individual, and on the other hand, he chooses him sovereignly, as Paul for example, who was separated for service from his birth.
-- And afterward called by grace.
-- If then one has received his mission from God as sovereign, one is kept in humility.
-- Paul could say, "By God's grace I am what I am" @1 Corinthians 15:10.
-- And that was a great triumph, Mr. L. An offering was presented at the same place where the altar of Baal was. And you see that his father approved it.
-- Dionysius, the Areopagite, was also won; @Acts 17.
-- All that of which we are speaking takes place between Gideon's soul, and God, and his father, before Gideon appears in public.
-- It is particularly interesting to see that it is a son who has this moral power with his father. In verse 34, "the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Gideon": God commits Himself to him.
-- What does "In the ordered manner" mean (verse 26)?
-- Everything had to be suitable, in Luke and the Acts. Everything is done "in the ordered manner". There is a certain manner which is suitable.
-- "Let all things be done comelily and with order" @1 Corinthians 14:40. That is the principal object of the gospel of Luke. It says, for example, "And having taken a loaf" (@Luke 22:19), it is a loaf and not a piece of bread, for the thought is a complete thought. It is not a part, but a complete idea. The local brethren will pardon my having made this remark.
-- Indeed we desire to do what is suitable.
-- So it says that Luke had set things out "with
{130}
method" (@Luke 1:3); and in the ordering of the Lord's supper, it speaks of manner -- "In like manner", it says in @Luke 22:20. At Corinth that was one of the chief difficulties: things were not done with decency and order. The outward things that are placed before our eyes have in view to produce unity. "In the power of one Spirit *we* have all been baptised into one body ... and have all been given to drink of one Spirit" @1 Corinthians 12:13. It is a matter of everything that tends to unity.
-- This all bears upon the ordered manner.
-- Would you give us your thought as to the collection? When is it suitable to make it?
-- What is done at the collection should be the expression of the love of the saints. There is what is material and public, which includes the symbols and the collection; it seems to me that that should go together. After that, we are free to enter into the things that are proper to the assembly, the things of God. In Ezekiel, "He that cometh in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and he that cometh in by the way of the south gate shall go out by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way of the gate by which he came in, but shall go out straight before him" @Ezekiel 46:9. He goes straight before him. We enter with things that relate to time: the Lord's supper which takes place until the Lord comes, and the collection which is in view of the needs of the saints. When we have finished with those things, we go straight before us; if we enter by the gate of the north, we go out by that of the south; we go straight forward. There is no one who closes the meeting. If I put the collection at the end, the meeting must be closed, and it is I who close the meeting, while the assembly belongs to the Lord; He says; "My assembly", and no one should take upon himself to close the meeting.
{131}
-- It would only be after having made the collection that we should enter the sanctuary. Then, we are free. We have finished with all that belongs to time. It says that "Having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives" @Matthew 26:30. I believe that is what is open to us after the Supper: we can move to heavenly places. It is He who begins the song in the midst of the assembly.
-- Such is the ordered manner!
-- And to what should the proceeds of the collection be devoted?
-- It was said to Paul that he should remember the poor, "which same thing also I was diligent to do" @Galatians 2:10. It is said of those who carried the money collected, they were "deputed messengers of assemblies, Christ's glory" (@2 Corinthians 8:23), which shows the place the collection holds: those who dispense it are "Christ's glory". It is for the support of the testimony, for the support of those who travel and who spend themselves for the Lord.
-- That is what belongs to time.
-- Then we rise higher and higher. According to the power that we possess, we can rise and have our heavenly part. The collection is so to speak sanctified because it expresses the love of the saints. You would not wish unconverted persons to take part in it; only believers should take part in the collection. All Gideon's private instruction had made him capable of acting. He blows the trumpet, but only after having been clothed upon by the Spirit of Jehovah. When he blows the trumpet, it is not a question merely of his father's house, but all hear it. It says that "they came up to meet him".
-- The trumpet is of importance.
-- It is the testimony which makes itself heard.
-- Could we say that his service begins at this moment?
{132}
-- Paul began quickly, when the Spirit sent him in company with Barnabas.
-- Would you say a few words with regard to the fleece?
-- The first sign is in verse 37: "If dew shall be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the ground, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast said". That means that God restricts His blessing to a certain locality, and He has a perfect right to do so. That is what He did in Old Testament times: He restricted His blessings to Israel. Now, the second sign is in verses 39 and 40: "Let it, I pray thee, be dry upon the fleece only, and upon all the ground let there be dew". God can allow His blessing to spread everywhere, and He can also withdraw it from where it was before. So historically, the blessing of God has been taken away from Israel, and has been spread over the nations. These two signs, therefore, indicate the rights of God in sovereignty.
-- The fact that Gideon asked for such signs does not point to great intelligence on his part, does it?
-- What he did not fully understand, we can understand now, because we have the full light, and these scriptures have been given for us. It is important that we should pay attention to the sovereign rights of God. He can place the blessing in one place, and withhold it from another place. It is not of him that wills, but of God that shows mercy. The epistle to the Romans teaches us this great principle with regard to Israel and the nations. The fall of Israel is the reconciliation of the world.
-- No servant can carry out his service well if he disregards the sovereign rights of God.
-- He must have the knowledge of God and of His sovereign rights.
-- Is there any significance in the "bowl-full of water" (verse 38)?
{133}
-- That refers to the blessing which was taken away from Israel, when the Lord took the cup, at the passover. There were two cups: one is connected with the passover, and the other with the Lord's supper. There was the passover cup which the Lord told them to take and pass from one to the other; that is what had been in Israel. The epistle to the Romans tells that they had much because to them were entrusted the oracles of God: all that has been brought to us, and more still.
-- The knowledge of God's sovereignty maintains the soul in humility.
-- And that teaches you too that God can pass you by, if it is His will.

THE ANOINTED VESSEL (1)
@1 Corinthians 3:1 - 23
-- In proposing this epistle, I should like us to see, with the Lord's help, what is the thought of God with regard to each local company of believers. According to this letter, God desires that each local company should be a vessel for Him, a vessel established in the light of the assembly, a vessel of testimony, and that this vessel should be morally clothed with dignity, for we see the thought of the anointing introduced in chapter 12, where it says, after having spoken of the human body as a figure, "So also is the Christ. For also in the power of one Spirit *we* have all been baptised into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bondmen or free, and have all been given to drink of one Spirit" @1 Corinthians 12:12,13. I believe this passage suggests the thought of a vessel clothed with dignity, to be used by the Lord in each locality. I hope that we shall see, with the Lord's help, that the elements that compose this vessel are developed in the early chapters.
-- Could we say that the divine thought is that there should be now, characteristically, in each locality, that which marked the Lord when He was upon earth?
-- The gospel of Luke presents the anointed Vessel, "the Christ". This epistle should serve to develop this thought with regard to the saints as forming one body. In @1 Corinthians 12, it speaks of the human body, as a figure, to represent the spiritual organism that God proposes to establish in each locality; to this end, it is necessary for each member to understand the teaching of the early chapters of the epistle. From the outset, dignity is in mind: "The assembly of God which is in Corinth" @1 Corinthians 1:2.
{135}
-- Have we the thought of dignity, when it speaks of "the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ" @1 Corinthians 1:9?
-- That is the provision relating to "the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus; that in everything ye have been enriched in him, in all word of doctrine, and all knowledge (according as the testimony of the Christ has been confirmed in you)" @1 Corinthians 1:4 - 6. In this passage the truth is presented objectively, but it gives us to see that the provision corresponds to the position. It is a question of what they had in Christ, and the testimony of the Christ was confirmed in them. That suggests what the thought of God is in the local vessel: "the testimony of the Christ" @1 Corinthians 1:6.
-- "So also is the Christ" @1 Corinthians 12:12. That is not exactly Christ personally; it is an anointed vessel.
-- In Christ, the testimony was lifted above that which belongs to the natural man; that is what strikes you in reading the gospel. The Lord begins by making good use of the Scriptures. Thank God, the Bible was in the synagogue of Nazareth; there were other books there as well, books of traditions that obscured much that is in the Bible. But the Bible was given to the Lord to read, and He found the scripture that described exactly the position that He occupied; He read, then closed the book and sat down, having delivered it to the attendant. The position was therefore clearly defined, and the fact that He sat down means that all that that position involved was to be developed. The words were words of grace and truth, which is true of the Vessel. The testimony was adorned by the Vessel. Now, we must keep that in mind, if we would correspond to Christ, in our locality.
-- In Luke's gospel, He is called "Son of the Highest" @Luke 1:32. The testimony is clothed with dignity in that Person.
-- Then it says, "Glory to God in the highest" @Luke 2:14.
{136}
That all refers to the moral dignity that marks the testimony of God.
-- The divine thought is that "the Christ" should be reproduced in the saints of the various localities, and that there should be found there a vessel in the dignity of the anointing. In Christendom, the idea of testimony is adopted without any idea of an anointed vessel; and Luke desires to introduce what is externally according to God. Thus in chapter 4 we have the idea of the Christ, the Anointed; the testimony is so to speak adorned, embellished.
-- There are two thoughts: that of the temple, and that of the body. In the temple all the light of God is viewed as a whole, all the light of God in grace; in the body, it is all the grace of God expressed in the saints, for the same locality.
-- The first nine verses of the first chapter form a kind of preface, but they show how the Corinthians were equipped, then finally there is the thought of the faithfulness of God who has called us into the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
-- Would you say that the thing was expressed in life, and not only in words?
-- The first five verses of chapter 2 confirm that.
-- The Lord, in the synagogue, could sit down and say, The fulfilment will be seen in Me. "To-day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears" @Luke 4:21.
-- A living voice was heard, for the scripture was read. The scripture went out of His mouth in living power, but He added, as a commentary, "To-day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears" @Luke 4:21. The astonished audience felt the effect of the words of grace that were coming out of His mouth. So then, although others may in the past have made use of that scripture, they were now brought into touch with a certain economy, and it was living to the ears of the audience. I believe that gives us the idea of "the Christ", and the ministry of Paul at Corinth corresponds to that,
{137}
and he desired that they themselves should profit by his example. He so desired that the things should be presented in a living way that in writing his epistle he speaks of Timothy: "*For this reason* I have sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who shall put you in mind of my ways as they are in Christ, according as I teach everywhere in every assembly" @1 Corinthians 4:17. His idea was that although he had been to Corinth himself, his letter should be accompanied by a living representative, and so, the divine thought is that there should be in each assembly a living representation.
-- When Paul was at Corinth, the Lord said to him by night, in a vision, "Fear not, but speak and be not silent; because I am with thee" @Acts 18:9. You have the thought of the anointed vessel, and the personal activities of the Lord to maintain the thoughts of God in a locality.
-- The Lord had gone about doing good, as the anointed Vessel, God being with Him. He was anointed, but also God was with Him. And here, in a corresponding way, the Lord was with Paul in his ministry. His ministry was in the power of the anointing.
-- He says, "I will come quickly to you, if the Lord will; and I will know, not the word of those that are puffed up, *but the power*" @1 Corinthians 4:19.
-- When he was at Corinth, "Paul was pressed in respect of the word" @Acts 18:5. The thought of an anointed vessel was expressed in him.
-- What is the idea of the temple? Is it that each one takes part there?
-- Christendom has abandoned what is living, and is content with what is material.
-- We see how far away the modern thought of the assembly is from what is found in this epistle.
-- Men cannot take in what is spiritual.
{138}
-- From verse 10 of the first chapter, we see how the great defection had commenced. After having presented to them the faithfulness of God, Paul warns them against what has spread abroad in Christendom. He says, "Each of you says" (@1 Corinthians 1:12); they were all in that same error of forming sects. "*I* am of Paul, and *I* of Apollos, and *I* of Cephas, and *I* of Christ" @1 Corinthians 1:12. We cannot have an anointed vessel under those conditions.
-- There must be, not sects, but unity.
-- In Luke, the genealogy of the Lord is not given on the patriarchal side. The names of His ancestors are indicated, and finally He is "Son ... of God".
-- And here, characteristically, it is "the assembly of God".
-- "But of him are *ye", of God*, "in Christ Jesus", (@1 Corinthians 1:30) which shows that we are not of Paul or of Cephas, but of God, and the believer takes account of himself as being of God in Christ Jesus.
-- What is said of Jesus, in Luke, is said of the saints, here.
-- "According as it is written, He that boasts, let him boast in the Lord" @1 Corinthians 1:31.
-- Nor must we try to introduce lesser men than Paul or Apollos; that would be still more serious, do you not think? We might for example call ourselves 'Darbyites', but that would be shameful.
-- One might also use the name of Christ in a sectarian way.
-- I was thinking of the young man who, running up, came to find the Lord, calling Him, "Good Teacher", whereas God alone is "good".
-- Just so. There are those who would give the Lord the first place among men; they would connect Him with those who are renowned, like Confucius and others. And the Lord would answer them: "Why callest thou me good? no one is good but one, that is God" @Mark 10:18.
{139}
-- Jesus is a divine Person, but as Man, as the anointed Vessel, "God was with him" @Acts 10:38.
-- And He links every heart with God, so that the result is that He leaves, in the temple, a company who are continually "praising and blessing God" @Luke 24:53.
-- In this epistle, we are lifted above the level of this world in relation to God. "*Of him* are ye in Christ Jesus" @1 Corinthians 1:30.
-- Thus, the heavenly city is the expression, in the world to come, of what is maintained in testimony in the saints of each locality, and it says that this heavenly vessel has the glory *of God*.
-- In the presence of this worship of men, so to speak, the apostle speaks of baptism which he seems to connect with it. He says, "Christ has not sent me to baptise" (@1 Corinthians 1:17) but to preach; and he brings out the character of the preaching: "For the word of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but to us that are saved it is God's power" @1 Corinthians 1:18.
-- "The cross" characterises the preaching.
-- The preaching of the cross does not recognise in the least the worship of heroes. The Greeks were perhaps those who had produced the most heroes; but it is a question of "the word of the cross". The word of the cross puts out of sight all that distinguishes man after the flesh down here. Certain Greeks who came up to Jerusalem wished to see the Lord; Andrew and Philip sought the Lord to tell Him, The Greeks are here. Ordinarily one would have considered it an honour that the Greeks came, for they seek wisdom. The wisdom of the Greeks forms the basis of the teaching of the present day. The literature and eloquence of the Greeks are very highly esteemed. Did the Lord think Himself honoured because these compatriots of Demosthenes sought Him? He knew exactly what they were. He had under His eyes, so to speak, the whole Greek world: its present, its past and its future; and He says,
{140}
"Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, it abides alone" (@John 12:24) our modern professors would say, 'Demosthenes deserves to be placed alongside of Christ'; but the Lord shows His entire contempt of that thought. "Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, it abides *alone*" @John 12:24. That is the Lord's thought, and Paul's! And here, what were the Corinthians doing? They were bringing in again this principle of hero-worship. I might become the best-taught man in the world, or the greatest orator, but that has not in itself the least value in the assembly of God. The Lord shows His greatest contempt of human wisdom. The apostle admits that the preaching of the cross was foolishness, but he says to those who believe, "it is God's power" @1 Corinthians 1:18. "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and set aside the understanding of the understanding ones. Where is the wise? where scribe? where disputer of this world? has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom has not known God, God has been pleased by the foolishness of the preaching to save those that believe. Since Jews indeed ask for signs, and Greeks seek wisdom" @1 Corinthians 1:19 - 22. The apostle brings the wisdom of God in here to pour contempt on the wisdom of this world which ought to have no place among the saints of God; and he found himself, it seems, at the root, at the basis of this leaven that was among the saints at that moment. The second epistle brings in wisdom once more.
-- The wisdom of the Greeks left man where it found him.
-- The Lord despises it.
-- At the end of the chapter, "Of him", *of God*, "are *ye* in Christ Jesus" @1 Corinthians 1:30. He "has been made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and holiness, and redemption" @1 Corinthians 1:30. Thus, we are set up by God in all that we have need of, in Christ. If we boast in
{141}
anyone, let it be "in the Lord". If the Lord gives us the sense of what it is to be *of God in Christ Jesus*, "who has been made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and holiness, and redemption" (@1 Corinthians 1:30), I think we shall have a good foundation for our meetings.
-- All this shows that what there was in Christ as a Vessel for the glory of God, is to be continued in the assembly which is here, at Valence, among the saints of this locality, characteristically, as if the Lord were Himself at Valence. We begin this epistle with the sense of what is of God, for it is a question of "the assembly of God which is in Corinth" @1 Corinthians 1:2.
-- This is not an individual thought; we all form part of this vessel, the assembly.
-- In chapter 14, the man falls upon his face, acknowledging the presence of God amongst the saints.
-- As we said at Beauvoisin, the population of Corinth was divided into three classes: Jews, Greeks, and the assembly. I go to the synagogue; I find the Scriptures there, but they are obscured by tradition; there is no life; one may hear much about the patriarchs, but there is no life. I go to the Greeks; I find there many books concerning the wisdom of men, but there is nothing for my soul; at Athens they went to Areopagus to hear the news, the events of the day, the actions and thoughts of wicked men. Then, I enter into the assembly of God; I find there the Bible, a sanctified company, divine order, ministry; I am conscious that God is there; I am exercised; I fall upon my face and I report that God is indeed amongst them. That is the important point.
-- The secrets of the heart are manifested.
-- And what God had in His mind as to Corinth has not changed as to all the gatherings.

THE ANOINTED VESSEL (2)
@1 Corinthians 4
-- For those who were not here yesterday evening, we might say what is the object in view in considering this epistle: it is that we might lay hold of the divine intention in each local Christian company, that is to say that it should be a vessel by means of which God can display His order and His testimony. We have taken special notice of the expression which occurs in chapter 12, referring to the saints as having been baptised in the power of one Spirit and as having been given to drink of one Spirit. It says of them, "So also is the Christ" @1 Corinthians 12:12.
-- It says that they are themselves "*the Christ*".
-- The assembly should appear in this world in the power and dignity of the anointing. In the first chapter it says that the testimony of the Christ was confirmed in them. We spoke of the service of the Lord as it is presented in Luke: He displayed the complete divine thought known and seen in Himself -- the Vessel. I think the first four chapters describe the character of the ministry, and also of the minister by means of whom the light came to the Corinthians. It says in these chapters that the ministry corresponded to the minister of it; in the same way that Luke presents the perfection of the Vessel in our Lord Jesus, so Paul, in his measure, was according to Christ. He served in the power and dignity of the anointing. These chapters therefore have a very special voice for those who carry on ministry among the saints. The divine thought is that the servant should be a model, or an expression of his service, and the genitive idea is thus perpetuated. As the gospel of Luke does, this epistle brings out that everything proceeds from God. It is like the book of Genesis
{143}
which develops the great patriarchal ideas. Primarily all comes from God, but in taking up Abraham, God develops the patriarchal idea; so Paul says here, "If ye should have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus *I* have begotten you through the glad tidings"; there was a perfectly pure seed (as the prophet speaks of it); and in order that there should be "seed after its kind" (@Genesis 1:12), according to Genesis, Timothy is sent so that the primary idea should be before the Corinthians. The idea was to be there, before them, in his spiritual child; he was his "beloved and faithful child in the Lord". That is the genitive idea!
-- Would you say that the Lord took the place of father when, coming down from the mountain, He dealt with the child? The father could not do anything; then the Lord took his place.
-- The idea of a father is found everywhere in the gospels. The Lord Himself uses the words, 'son', 'daughter'. In Mark, He took little children and laid His hands on them, as if to give them His personal impression. Instead of having a natural impression, these children would have an impression of what Christ represented; the idea is developed in John; rather on the side of the family. But Luke introduces the idea of a new race. And here, we have what is of God.
-- "Ye are *of God*" @1 John 4:4.
-- In Hebrews the Lord speaks of the children whom God has given Him. They are of God.
-- The Lord, according to Luke's gospel, found His delights with the sons of men. Luke develops the idea of children of wisdom, and this feature plays a great part in this epistle. Paul develops the great ideas of wisdom in the way in which he served the Corinthians.
-- In @Proverbs 23:15, the appeal of a father to his children is like Paul's appeal to the Corinthians:
{144}
"My son, if thy heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice". In Luke, words of grace were coming out of the Lord's mouth; and Paul has in his heart this ideal for his children; he speaks in heavenly grace.
-- The book of Proverbs develops, with regard to wisdom, the thought of ornament. With those who possess wisdom, a word spoken in season is like "apples of gold in baskets of silver" (@Proverbs 25:11, note): the word is beautiful in itself, but its beauty is augmented by the setting -- "baskets of silver". If therefore we exercise a ministry, we must seek to be like the Model, otherwise our ministry will not commend itself; we could not hope that the result would be according to God, for it is inevitable that those who are enlightened by any servant whatever take on more or less the character of the minister. The Thessalonians became imitators of Paul, and then of the Lord (@1 Thessalonian 1:6), for it is certain that they saw in the Lord the perfection of what they had already seen in Paul.
-- In the second epistle, he says, "By manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of men before God" @2 Corinthians 4:2.
-- We must notice what Paul says in chapter 2, in relation to his ministry. He refers to "that hidden wisdom" (@1 Corinthians 2:7) which was prepared before the world for our glory. None of the princes of this world, none of the "princes of this age" knew it; this expression is an allusion to intellectual men as well as leaders of other classes.
-- That is the heads of universities, as well as the Pharisees.
-- Is that the reason that God allowed all kinds of personages to appear on the scene before Christ came?
-- And His coming eclipsed them all.
-- Probably the greatest products of human culture preceded the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ. They were on the scene shortly before His birth.
{145}
-- Since that period, human culture has never produced men like Aristotle, Demosthenes, etc. When their influence had reached its zenith, then Jesus appeared.
-- The census was made by Caesar Augustus, an emperor who had a great realm and great splendour, and he would not have failed to bring into evidence everything that set off the mind of man. Amidst all that human glory, Jesus was born.
-- The inn was filled with all these giants. There was no place for the Lord; He comes into the manger. *He* comes in, and *they* go out. The Lord of glory came in, and none of the princes of this world were there to receive Him, but the heavenly princes were there announcing the glory of God in the highest.
-- That which came into the world was duly published; there was a multitude of the heavenly host. Gabriel, a great prince in the heavens, had already been occupied with the birth of the Lord. He had spoken to Zacharias, and to Mary. The birth of the Lord of glory had therefore been suitably published in the heavens; while, upon earth, there was no salutation on the part of the princes of this age.
-- But there were shepherds who were keeping watch over their flocks during the night watches. These were not found in the pleasure-gardens of the great city: they were keeping watch over their flocks during the night; and they are all specially distinguished. An angel appeared to them, saying, "Behold, I announce to you glad tidings of great joy, which shall be to all the people; for today a Saviour has been born to you in David's city, who is Christ the Lord" @Luke 2:10,11. Not only He *will be* the Lord, but He is the Lord of glory.
-- The "good pleasure in men" supposes that He is going to have a race of men whom he begets for the pleasure of God.
{146}
-- We see in the gospel of Luke that it is a question of a race. A race is in view.
-- Jerusalem was formerly an ornament on the earth.
-- The "Babe" who is brought in was to be the ornament.
-- "Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion" @Psalm 48:2. Our hearts are much affected if we compare the interest of heaven in the birth of the Lord Jesus with what took place on earth.
-- It is indeed very touching; no one came to find Him; but all heaven was occupied with Him.
-- The humble shepherds knew it.
-- And these humble shepherds formed the link between heaven and earth, the beginning of the new race, and they are moved by this beginning. "Let us see this thing that is come to pass" (@Luke 2:15), they say. They went to Bethlehem and saw the Babe. A movement was produced in answer to the testimony, and a few days later we find the representative of the new race -- Simeon -- in the temple. Simeon was the representative. He came into the temple. It had been revealed to him that he should not see death before he should see the Lord's Christ. By the Spirit, he came into the temple and took the Child into his arms.
-- He took the Child from His parents. It is not said that he gave the Child back to His parents, for he represents the race which keeps the thoughts of God regarding Christ during the whole dispensation.
-- He is the priest, and with divinely given intelligence, he announces adoringly, "Lord, now thou lettest thy bondman go, according to thy word, in peace; for mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples" @Luke 2:29 - 31. So we are, as it were, introduced into a new world, and the energy of Anna completes the picture. It is
{147}
the setting aside of the "princes of this age". You see where we are introduced.
-- Into the company of Anna and Simeon?
-- If we are to become effective servants, we must consider them both.
-- Simeon blessed God with Christ. Anna blessed the saints with Christ.
-- I believe that Paul shows us in these chapters how he was in accord with all that. He excludes man. In verse 14 of chapter 2, he says, "But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him; and he cannot know them because they are spiritually discerned" @1 Corinthians 2:14. He insists that the things of God are presented to us and are searched by the Spirit of God; and the natural man, whatever his education, cannot take them in, but believers have the mind of Christ.
-- "So that the thoughts may be revealed from many hearts" @Luke 2:35.
-- The universal light which shone round about these shepherds was to produce universal worship which would ascend to God.
-- That is what Luke presents, and he concludes his gospel with a company "continually in the temple, praising and blessing God" @Luke 24:53.
-- We were speaking of the universal light which the shepherds had received. We find afterwards "a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon" (@Luke 2:25); and then, Anna "spoke of him to all those who waited for redemption in Jerusalem" @Luke 2:38. In one locality, the universal position and way are maintained.
-- Simeon represents rather what is of the Spirit and it is specially said that "he came in the Spirit into the temple" (@Luke 2:27), which corresponds to that verse: "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?" @1 Corinthians 3:16. Anna represents what is developed subjectively. The man generally represents what is objective; the woman,
{148}
that which corresponds subjectively. Anna would represent the subjective feature. The end of the gospels, with the exception of Luke's gospel, presents the woman, indicating the subjective result of what has been presented of God. There was the anointing of Him by whom the light came. There is a subjective effect in four women, who, taken together, represent the complete answer to Christ in the assembly; "so also is the Christ" @1 Corinthians 12:12.
-- Would you touch on the subject of the anointing of the Lord in the four gospels? If you put the four together, you have subjectively in the saints "the Christ".
-- There is first the anointing in the gospel of Matthew, in chapter 26; it is a question there of the subjective appreciation of rule. That is a great feature in the assembly, and it is the subject of the gospel of Matthew. In Mark, the anointing in chapter 14 gives us the idea of the subjective appreciation of levitical service. The anointing in @John 12 would represent the subjective appreciation of *the Person* of the Christ, not what He is officially, but what He is personally.
-- All this forms "the Christ", His body which is here.
-- In Luke 7, we have a woman who appreciates the grace which comes out in Christ. So we form a part of those who love Christ. The Lord's attention is fixed on the woman, and He says, "Seest thou this woman?" @Luke 7:44. We are of those who love Christ as the One by whom grace has come to us, and this thought connects with that which is anointed in chapter 12 of this epistle.
-- Would the four cases illustrate, "We ... have all been given to drink of one Spirit" @1 Corinthians 12:13?
-- Yes. The baptism of the Spirit presents the objective side. We do not baptise ourselves; it is a divine action. When we are made to drink, it is our
{149}
action; we have a sense of the value of the thing; we enjoy it.
-- "In the power of one Spirit *we* have all been baptised" (@1 Corinthians 12:13) is a divine act. "Given to drink" means that we respond; we drink; it is our action.
-- Before closing, let us glance at chapters 3 and 4. We see how Paul speaks emphatically of the foundation that is laid, "which is Jesus Christ", that is to say an order of man who has been fully tested in His life down here and has shown Himself perfectly capable of resisting every temptation. The order of man presented in Christ had been put to the test in His life down here, and He it is who had been presented as foundation.
-- Does that correspond to the Lord's foundation in Matthew 16?
-- Matthew 16 depends on the Son of the living God, known only by means of revelation, by means of testimony, the testimony of the gospels.
-- David presents what was put to the test, but Solomon presents another side.
-- Solomon was a son unto his father, tender and an only one in the sight of his mother (@Proverbs 4:3), but in David we see a life publicly tested, and that is not only recorded for us in the inspired history, but Nathan, Gad and Samuel wrote on the subject. The years had passed over him; he was old and full of days. The days had been passed in going out and coming in among the people, in service for them, and it was the same with the Lord Jesus. We have four inspired records, and John says that there are many other things; if they were written, the whole world could not contain the books. So the apostles were to stand in the temple and speak of Jesus Christ. It is in that Person that the foundation is found; it is just a question of testimony.
-- The world could not contain all the books concerning the acts of Jesus, but the vessel here is
{150}
necessary and sufficient to be the living expression of them.
-- What is the difference between revelation and testimony?
-- The revelation in @John 1 is universal; it is for the whole world. In the case of Peter, it was a special revelation; the principle of revelation should be understood by every believer. In revelation, it is a question of that which is in my soul and which comes from God. Paul does not deal with that here; he is dealing with that which is presented to them.
-- Testimony?
-- A foundation in their soul, "which is Jesus Christ". He was a complete example in his personal walk before them.
-- Would you say a few words further on revelation?
-- It is difficult to express what I have in mind as to revelation; each believer should enter into it. The Lord said to Simon, "Flesh and blood has not revealed it *to thee*" @Matthew 16:17. If He said simply, "Flesh and blood has not revealed it", that would be general; but a divine transaction must take place in the soul of each one contemplated, as distinct from what is presented in testimony.
-- Revelation was made to Saul, when the Lord spoke to him on the road to Damascus.
-- Revelation gives me, so to speak, an individual position in the spiritual sphere. What is presented in testimony might be presented to a hundred persons at once.
-- The Lord said to Ananias, "Go, for this man is an elect vessel to me, to bear my name before both nations and kings and the sons of Israel: for *I* will show to him how much he must suffer for my name" @Acts 9:15,16.

THE ANOINTED VESSEL (3)
@1 Corinthians 5; @1 Corinthians 10:14 - 22
-- Towards the end of our meeting this morning, we considered the character of the foundation which is laid. It says that the foundation is Jesus Christ. We noticed the difference between what we have here and what we have in Matthew 16. In Matthew, the foundation refers rather to the relations of our Lord with God: He is the Christ, the Son of the living God. The revelation made to Peter was a personal revelation. "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona, for flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens. And I also, I say unto thee that *thou* art Peter, and on this rock I will build my assembly" @Matthew 16:17,18. The Lord lays emphasis on the individuality of Peter and what he was personally; as having received a personal revelation, he formed, so to speak, part of the material for the building -- the building of which the Lord speaks as being "My assembly". The foundation refers to the testimony presented to all at Corinth. It was a question of "Jesus Christ", the One who had been known and tested in this world under the eye of God. And we all have to be tested, as forming publicly part of the assembly. So we do well to notice the foundation, that which is presented in the four gospels. The foundation is involved in the expression "the words of this life" @Acts 5:20. "The words" would suggest the life in detail. There is "the *word* of life" and "the *words* of this life" @Acts 5:20.
-- It says, "*All* the words of this life" @Acts 5:20.
-- Then a warning is given in chapter 3, to all those who build thereon, in order that there should be nothing in the building that does not agree with the foundation. What was accomplished in this way at
{152}
Corinth gives rise to another thought -- that of the temple.
-- What is the thought relating to the temple?
-- It is there that the divine mind is by the Spirit. This is not exactly revelation, but light that is shed with regard to what is revealed. Under the old economy, the things in the temple referred to the revelation: the ark of the covenant, the cherubim, the table, the candlestick, the golden altar, everything there related to the revelation; and the temple implies that light is always available with regard to these things. The saints therefore have means, which are independent of all that is of man, of receiving light from God; hence the seriousness of corrupting such a thing. If this temple is corrupted, that which purports to be light from God may become darkness. We are occupied now with what relates to a meeting such as this. The fact that we are together today provides the Spirit an opportunity of shedding light on what is already revealed, and each one ought to be in his place, to fulfil his function in the temple.
-- Do you think that the wisdom of God is manifested in the saints as being the temple of God?
-- That which I have understood of Christ as being the wisdom of God ought to shine in me in the temple. The might of the assembly is like that of a stone most precious.
-- David spoke of the temple as a place where one could enquire.
-- The Greeks had the idea of a temple, as much as the Jews. The Christians at Corinth were to know that they themselves were that temple by virtue of the Holy Spirit dwelling in them.
-- I was thinking of the candlestick which was in the holy place, and of which the lamps shone *before the candlestick*.
-- That points to the light that the Spirit sheds on things already revealed; so, the idea of a "creed"
{153}
does not touch this idea. We have the teaching of the apostles, but spiritual light renders that teaching ever fresh and applicable to ourselves. As an example, one might say that a spiritual song brings out what is already revealed to our hearts. "The book of the wars of Jehovah" (@Numbers 21:14) and "the poets" (@Numbers 21:27) go together, in so far as the Spirit is recognised. Thus, all spiritual ministry proceeds from the temple. In Christianity, there is that which existed from the beginning, which must never be lost sight of, but that which existed from the beginning is brought to us in the power of the Spirit, to us who live in the present day.
-- How do you connect this with chapter 5
-- All that we have remarked is connected with the ministry. It is a question in chapter 3 of the minister and the ministry; the bearing of the chapter is particularly on those who serve, so that we should not bring into the building any foreign material, and that we should not corrupt the temple of God.
-- The order of man should be before us in the foundation. We cannot build if we lose sight of it.
-- When we come to the temple, it is then a question of what is *of God*.
-- "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? If any one corrupt the temple of God, *him* shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are *ye*" @1 Corinthians 3:16,17. You see the prominence given to the temple of God.
-- The princes of this age disappear in the presence of the princes of a much more elevated order which appears in the temple.
-- The princes of this age are removed from the mind of the believer. What emanates from the temple of God eclipses the best human productions. As to those who go astray from the truth of the assembly, although they may retain correct outward forms, they will be found without freshness. This is what we have sorrowfully seen among certain of
{154}
our brethren who have separated from us. What a warning against the idea of a party! The end of chapter 3 especially is intended to warn the saints, and particularly servants, against the thought of following men. Then, in chapter 4, the apostle enlarges on what characterised him in that connection. He indicates that the servants belong to the saints. He did not care about men's judgment. "But he that examines me is the Lord" @1 Corinthians 4:4. Then he says, "I think that God has set us the apostles for the last, as appointed to death. For we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and men" @1 Corinthians 4:9. Not only were they found in a position of suffering, on account of their testimony, but God had placed them in that position. He did not wish the apostles to become personally the leaders of schools. Paul says, "To the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and are in nakedness, and buffeted, and wander without a home, and labour, working with our own hands ..." @1 Corinthians 4:11,12. To the present hour they corresponded to the thought of God. It is what they *are* still at that moment, and not only what they were.
-- Why does he say, "a spectacle ... *to angels*"?
-- That was in accord with their place of prominence in the testimony. It had been the same at the cross. The angels have a great interest in all that corresponds with the cross.
-- They desired to look into the sufferings of Christ.
-- And the angels saw the continuation of the sufferings in the apostles. These are very remarkable chapters for those who aspire to the ministry. We must remember that our ministry is to produce something, and generally, as water rises to its own level, the product of our ministry corresponds with ourselves.
-- The measure of Christ in the servant is the measure of his productive capacity.
-- Everything else will be devoured by fire.
{155}
-- The apostles began to preach at Jerusalem. The Lord had prayed for Jerusalem, and He had wept over Jerusalem. The apostles who had a peculiar place in the testimony had observed the affections of Christ, in His sufferings.
-- And the beginning of the Acts insists much on the correspondence between those who were speaking and Christ. In the first chapter, Jesus appeared to them "after he had suffered" (@Acts 1:3); they were to continue on the principle of sufferings. Then you find, in chapters 3 and 4 of the Acts, what God could produce in Peter and John. "Look on us" (@Acts 3:4), they could say to the lame man. If they were put in prison, they rejoiced to be counted worthy to suffer for His name. In these men we see the anointing oil with which the tabernacle was anointed: the Spirit of a suffering Christ.
-- We have a spiritual faculty to assimilate to ourselves the thoughts of God as to Christ.
-- There is moral accord between the servants and a suffering Christ. In the Song of Songs, the loved one says, "A bundle of myrrh is my beloved unto me" (@Song of Songs 1:13); there is not only one feature of suffering, but *every* feature of suffering -- which the bundle suggests; it is in the light of that expression that she embraces Him. Paul said that he was to fill up that which was behind of the tribulations of Christ.
-- The epistle to the Philippians is the product, in the saints, of the bundle of myrrh.
-- When we reach chapter 5 of 1 Corinthians, it is not a question of things for which the servants are responsible, but it is the responsibility of the assembly to purge out leaven. Without discipline the things of God cannot be preserved among us. In a general way, those who depart from the assembly are incapable of maintaining discipline. The principle of discipline is that the Lord is to be feared in the assembly of His
{156}
saints. The apostle spoke of having already judged, to deliver, "in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ ... him that has so wrought this ... to Satan". A human organisation has no power in discipline, in spite of the best catechism it may have. Discipline depends on the Lord Jesus Christ, and it is exercised among the saints in a collective way.
-- Are the saints thus sustained in power and holiness, in which Christ Himself met and set aside all that is contrary to God and His throne?
-- At the outset of the Lord's ministry, when He was about to cast out the demon in the synagogue of Capernaum, the demon recognised that He was "the Holy One of God" @Mark 1:24. We must recognise the holiness of God. This does not concern only the principal brothers, but it is to come home to each brother and each sister in the company.
-- We cannot have God in our midst except in holiness; and where should we be without the presence of God?
-- Do you think that a person who does not maintain holiness in his own house can maintain it in the house of God?
-- Can he even maintain it in his own soul?
-- Those from whom demons had been cast out represent Christians who experience in themselves the effect of demons cast out of their soul. Mary of Magdala had had seven demons; such a sister would not be able to tolerate uncleanness in the assembly. It was a terrible experience to be possessed by an unclean spirit, and when the Lord has cast out an unclean spirit, there remains a vessel in which the holiness of God can be developed.
-- The fact that Mary of Magdala was at the cross suggests the thought expressed in the Song of Songs: "My beloved ... shall pass the night between my breasts" @Song of Songs 1:13.
{157}
-- Mary said, "If *thou* hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away" @John 20:15.
-- Her affection was a holy affection. She desired Him.
-- While she was in the limitations of the night, the Lord gave her the light of an eternal day.
-- Mary of Magdala was qualified for holiness. What a vessel of uncleanness she must have been! But now, what a vessel of holiness!
-- The Lord could deposit in that vessel what was most glorious. What characterised Mary of Magdala forms the basis of what is developed in chapter 20 of John: "Receive the *Holy* Spirit" @John 20:22. In a general way, John does not lay emphasis, as Luke does, on holiness, but he says here, Receive that sort of Spirit -- a Spirit that would develop a holy life. Those of us who have judged sin in ourselves as before God and who have received the love of God should have the greatest care with regard to holiness in the house of God.
-- It is a question of a spiritual state to retain what is good. The same spiritual being can retain what is of God and exclude what is of man.
-- We have here the introduction of the passover and the feast of unleavened bread. Before the Lord's crucifixion both things are mentioned -- the passover and the feast of unleavened bread. The saints have arrived at the point where the question of sin is to be settled by God in Christ, by way of sacrifice; but there was more than that, for the saints were to be there, as well as the Lord. He Himself was to be the Passover, but the feast of unleavened bread was to be developed in the saints. Thus, the feast of unleavened bread forms the basis of all the instructions that follow, down to chapter 11. In chapter 10, we approach the truth of the assembly, and it is needful for the matter to be clear in our minds. In Matthew
{158}
and Mark, the Lord's supper was introduced "as they were eating" @Mark 14:22. If the Lord suffers as the paschal Lamb, the saints must eat that which answers to it, and that is what is in view in this chapter.
-- Would you say a few words as to the Spirit which disavows mere memory and every human and intellectual faculty and brings us together in the light of the temple, at a moment like this, to enable us to enter together into the thoughts of God?
-- Our natural memories have no value, but there is the thinking faculty which answers to that of Christ, and not only the faculty, but "the intelligent faculty with its thoughts" @1 Corinthians 2:16 (note). Therefore, in assembling ourselves, we have the light of that faculty. The precious thoughts that we treasure by the power of the Holy Spirit are those which God uses when the brethren are assembled. We treasure them in a passive way, and we give the Lord and the Spirit opportunity to act.
-- We ought to be like a stringed instrument in the hands of the Lord. It is He Himself who touches the chords, and we ought to be disposed to listen rather than to speak. The "five words" would be a contribution from the temple.
-- "Five words with my understanding" @1 Corinthians 14:19.
-- It is in view of consolidating the present work of God, by the Spirit, in the hearts of His own assembled.
-- In entering upon the subject of the assembly, the apostle says, "I speak as to intelligent persons". Therefore, what I possess, as taught of God, should be at the disposal of the company. God may call me to say something; then I ought to be ready.
-- It is the state of mind in which I hold myself. We are not therefore, as is sometimes said, empty vessels. God makes use of full vessels.
-- Paul speaks of the treasure which is in an earthen vessel. The earthen vessel is therefore not empty.
-- "Each of you *has* a psalm" @1 Corinthians 14:26. I suppose that I
{159}
have that psalm. But I need not give it out because I have it. Nevertheless, *I have it*.
-- The effect of being in the temple is that different passages of which I had never thought are connected one with another.
-- That is what we see in the apostles at the beginning. They quote the Psalms and other Old Testament scriptures and connect them one with the other.
-- The bearing of the Scriptures becomes clearer, because we receive, in that faculty, the mind of Christ. What could be more important than that?
-- We see then the great importance of gathering together in the light of the temple, and of functioning in the temple.
-- By this means, what is clerical is set aside. Instead of having recourse to a very gifted brother, the saints have recourse to God, and receive the thoughts of His heart by the Holy Spirit.
-- James, at the first Church Council, quotes the prophet Amos to bring out the mind of God.
-- "And the apostles and the elders were gathered together to see about this matter" (@Acts 15:6), and that matter was examined by reference to the temple. The discussion which took place was a holy and brotherly discussion. Then Peter stood up and brought out how God, by his mouth, had preached to the nations. Later, James rose, and in his discourse he connected what Peter had said with a passage from the prophet Amos. So we see how, on that memorable occasion, the light of the temple shone. Light came in, but the Holy Spirit also came in: "It has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us" @Acts 15:28. No assembly in the world could act thus. The divine mind came out, and was imposed upon everyone among the nations.
-- Our attitude of mind is that we want to acquire. Like the bees, we take a little nectar from each flower; when we have acquired something, in our secret history with God, we are found together in
{160}
that mind. God can use what we have and multiply it in the temple, as the Lord was able to multiply what the little lad had and feed the five thousand.
-- The first chapter of the Acts gives us an example of the temple in function. The Lord goes up to heaven, and His own, those who were His witnesses, return to Jerusalem and go into the upper chamber; the names of the principal ones who were there are given to us. We find an expression such as this: "the crowd of names who were together" (@Acts 1:15), that is to say the names indicated what material was there. There was material for the temple. It says that in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples. He speaks; and he draws attention to the treachery of Judas and quotes the Psalm that covers that event, saying, "Let another take his overseership" @Acts 1:20. Who is to take his office? "It is necessary therefore, that of the men who have assembled with us all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day in which he was taken up from us, one of these should be a witness with us of his resurrection" @Acts 1:21,22. The matter is placed in God's hands by the lot, and the lot falls on Matthias. Thus, the mind of God is brought into view as to him who is to be chosen. The material for the temple to be erected is tested before it is occupied by the Holy Spirit.
-- And in chapter 15, the Holy Spirit has taken the place of the lot.
-- The thought of the temple is that God is there; and God manifests Himself. The one who takes his place in the company which is going to be the temple has seen Jesus move down here.
-- They are the movements of divine Persons who come in and go out "among us".

{161}
SPIRITUAL JUDGMENT
@1 Corinthians 6:1 - 5; @John 18:19 - 24; @Judges 3:5 - 11; @Judges 4:1 - 6 ( ... commanded?)
According to the passage we have read in the epistle to the Corinthians, we see, as regards judgment, what is the destiny of the saints who compose the assembly: they will judge the world and they will judge angels. May we now, in the exercise of judgment among the saints, be qualified for our great functions to come in this respect!
The question is put as follows, in the epistle to the Corinthians: "Thus there is not a wise person among you, not even one, who shall be able to decide between his brethren!" Is there not such a man who can settle questions among his brethren? It is evident that they were lacking in such wisdom, in spite of all that the apostle Paul says as to them (@1 Corinthians 1:5 - 7). The question that he puts makes us think that there was not a wise man among them, a man capable of deciding difficult questions among his brethren. Nevertheless, he maintains that those who form part of the assembly are qualified to act thus, for he orders that those who are "little esteemed in the assembly" should be employed for such occasions. "Set those to judge who are little esteemed in the assembly". Notice that the one who was to be employed is a person of the assembly, for intelligent persons are found "in the assembly"; and if wisdom is not there, it will not be found anywhere in the world. "If two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter, whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens" @Matthew 18:19. It is a question of two or three who are in the assembly.
I now desire to show you, from the other passages
{162}
we have read, how this spirit of judgment is to be developed in us; in that, as in all else, we must learn from Christ. He is found before the throne of judgment, where true justice ought to have been administered; but He was not Himself on the throne of judgment, although that throne belonged to Him. God "has set a day in which he is going to judge the habitable earth in righteousness by the man whom he has appointed, giving the proof of it to all in having raised him from among the dead" @Acts 17:31. He is the Judge, and the world will soon get the benefit of His perfect administration. It will not be an administration encumbered by interminable Acts of Parliament. It would be very difficult for anyone to read all the Acts of Parliament of men, even if one spent a whole life at it. They have their own value; but our Lord Jesus Christ Himself sums up the whole law in these two commandments: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy understanding. This is the great and first commandment. And the second is like it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments the whole law and the prophets hang" @Matthew 22:37 - 40. Our great and beloved Lawgiver will write these two commandments in the hearts of men; and the world to come, of which He will be Judge, will enjoy a perfect administration of justice.
Nevertheless, at the moment of which we are speaking, He was not on the throne of judgment: He was at the bar of the tribunal of men: it is the opposite of all moral history. As the passage in @John 18 shows, the position was reversed, for the Judge of Israel was there, in the presence of all. It is true that He was smitten, but He was present; He did not keep silence, for that moment formed part of His testimony as the Judge of Israel. Before leaving this world, our Lord was to bear witness to just judgment. As if he were himself the true judge,
{163}
the high priest questions Him. He calls witnesses, for, according to the law, "at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established" @Deuteronomy 19:15. "The high priest therefore demanded of Jesus concerning his disciples and concerning his doctrine. Jesus answered him, *I* spoke openly to the world; *I* taught always in the synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews come together, and in secret I have spoken nothing. Why demandest thou of me? Demand of those who have heard, what I have spoken to them; behold, *they* know what I have said". The Lord's acts were public. His ministry was public. He did nothing, and said nothing, in secret. There were thousands of witnesses of what He had said and done. Why were they not called, if He was to be judged? But we see that one of them gave Him a blow on the face. Such was the character of the throne of judgment before which the Lord was found. Since everything was based on witness, if He had spoken evil, why not bear witness of the evil? And if He had spoken well, why smite Him? "If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why smitest thou me?" The Lord did not defend Himself, though He might have appealed to legions of angels. He had told the disciples that if they were smitten on one cheek, they were to present the other.
If therefore there are differences between brethren, we have here the principles on which judgment is to be carried out; and if a wise man is found among them, he will act according to these principles. He will thus qualify for that great function in the day to come. The Judge of Israel, in presence of the high priest, had established all these principles; and they should be maintained and put into practice in the assembly today, as they will be in the future.
These principles were applied in Israel, in old times, when the need was felt. The first judge of Israel
{164}
was Othniel, and I believe that if we examine the passage in the book of Judges regarding him, we shall learn from that judge a feature that should form the basis of all judgment approved of God. The people of God were living in bad company; it says, "The children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites and Amorites and Perizzites and Hivites and Jebusites". They "dwelt", it says. And what was the result? It was that they inter-married, with the inevitable consequence that the practices of those nations characterised the people of God. It is a very serious situation -- a situation that has often characterised the people of God, and which characterises them much in our day. Such circumstances bring in the governmental ways of God, and His ways are always the fruit of His love. The divine thought is expressed in the judge; and deliverance is also in the judge. The oppressor sent by the government of God was the king of Mesopotamia (that is to say "Syria of the two rivers"), a man possessed of great natural resources -- learning which is very dangerous among the people of God and which brings you down to the level of men around you; in such a case we are sure to fall to the level of those who have only natural resources. Then there is neither progress nor spirituality. In those circumstances the judge must have great spiritual resources. There is no reason why there should be one of us not characterised by this, for faith's resources are immense.
Othniel belonged to a blessed family, and no one can be a judge according to God if he does not belong to that family. He was of the family of a man, Caleb, whose faith had shone in the darkest days, and he persevered in faith; at the age of eighty-five years, this Caleb was full of vigour. "I am still this day strong, as in the day that Moses sent me" @Joshua 14:11. He appreciated the inheritance of God and possessed the power to take possession of it. Further, Othniel
{165}
had as wife the daughter of that great man of faith, who possessed great spiritual means. Othniel's wife knew how to ask. She had encouraged her husband to ask of her father a field. She herself asked, "Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a southern land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs" @Judges 1:15. The king of Mesopotamia, with his two rivers, had no such resources. No man of this world has the resources possessed by the man of faith, a man established in the light of the assembly, and who has received, as blessings, the upper springs and the lower springs. He is infinitely superior to the man of this world, whatever he may possess materially. So Othniel was found beyond the reach of natural influences. How many of the Lord's servants are independent of natural influences? Deliverance from these influences lies in laying hold of the resources which are available to us; and that is what is seen in Othniel and in Achsah. They acted on the principle of asking. So Othniel judged Israel and went out to war. "And Jehovah gave Chushan-rishathaim king of Syria into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushan-rishathaim. And the land had rest forty years". You see, beloved, the great principle which is established in Othniel with regard to judgment; it is the principle of cultivating our spiritual resources and increasing them.
The other judge was Ehud. This man was different from Othniel. As to him, it was no question of family relations, nor of great spiritual resources. It was a question for him of the word of God. No one can be judge among the people of God, save one who knows how to use the Scriptures, and who knows how to use them spiritually. "For the word of God is living and operative, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and penetrating to the division of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and a discerner
{166}
of the thoughts and intents of the heart" @Hebrews 4:12. This man's weapon was a sword having two edges. You will remark that the sword has *two* edges; and I must know how to use this sword against myself. I can only use it against another if I have used it against myself This weapon distinguished between soul and spirit, and between joints and marrow; "a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart". If therefore I have been personally searched by the word, there is no danger of my using partiality. I shall know how to judge; my judgment will be a righteous judgment; it will be according to the thoughts of God.
Ehud had to do with a fat man. It was a matter of human pride. Eglon king of Moab was "a very fat man" @Judges 3:17. How much the people of God have been oppressed by human pride! How much they have suffered from it! How many things there are of which we are proud, alas! Yet all these humiliating things are not even worth the trouble of being mentioned by a Christian. Nevertheless, we are proud of them. We are enclosed in our own fat. What is to be done? A secret sword with two edges is absolutely necessary. It was no question of religious culture for Ehud: he was left-handed. He was not a normal man. He would have been quite despised in the seminaries; but he effectively maintained what met the situation at that moment. He acted ruthlessly against that terrible thing -- pride -- which has its origin in Satan himself. The secret of Satan's fall was his pride. The saints themselves have to suffer from pride. If this man is to judge, in the presence of pride, he needs this sword -- a sword having two edges; he knows how to wield it: he wields it skilfully.
The next judge is Shamgar. I did not read the passage: @Judges 3:31. In him, we have another feature of this great principle of judgment. The
{167}
instrument he uses is an ox-goad. If an ox could speak, it would be able to tell you what a goad means; but we are occupied with men, and Scripture uses oxen to speak of men. "Thou shalt not muzzle the ox", it says, "that is treading out corn" (@1 Corinthians 9:9); but it does not say, Thou shalt not use the goad. The goad is the discipline of God. It sometimes seems severe to us, but it is necessary. When I have learnt the lesson that is needful for me I have acquired experience, and it is according to my experience with God that I possess power. "He smote the Philistines, six hundred men, with an ox-goad" @Judges 3:31. Who are the Philistines? Men of renown. They take a place among the people of God, because the latter have failed in their responsibility to exterminate them. As on previous occasions, they it was who ruled over Israel, but the man who possesses an ox-goad kills six hundred Philistines at one stroke, for in divine things he who can kill one can kill six hundred. So success flowed from experience.
If you have great spiritual resources, if you know how to use the word of God, if you have acquired experience in the school of God, then you will be qualified for spiritual judgment. Such are the great features that God can approve.
I will now speak of Deborah, in whom another feature is presented. It was a question of a woman; and it says that she "judged Israel *at that time*". At that time, Israel was ruled by a man having great military resources. His resources were not those of the king of Mesopotamia. This man of great military resources was Jabin; and he had nine hundred chariots of iron, a great display of military power. Could a woman face such a situation? Let the sisters in particular consider it with us. Let us see how God meets this serious state of things. We are in the presence of the greatest display of military strength against the people of God; and a woman is to overcome
{168}
all that. But how? She was the wife of Lapidoth, as Othniel was the husband of Achsah who had great spiritual resources; she was the wife of a man who had light (the name Lapidoth means 'light'). I believe she represents the believer in relation with Christ as "the Light", for the light is of the greatest importance when such a military force is to be met. In the epistle to the Ephesians, it speaks of the rulers of darkness against whom we have to struggle. The whole power of Satan is in view in the epistle to the Ephesians. We are therefore enlightened as to the place where Satan is and as to his power. It is an advantage to us to know the headquarters of the enemy and what are his forces.
But the light is not sufficient to gain the victory, and so we read that "she dwelt under the palm-tree of Deborah". She had gained victories herself. I cannot stand, in the presence of Satan, apart from that. It was not the palm-tree of Lapidoth; it was the palm-tree of Deborah. If it had been the palm-tree of Lapidoth, it would have been objective, but it was a question of experiences she had had herself. She had herself overcome. It is said that "he that ruleth his spirit is better than he that taketh a city" @Proverbs 16:32. The children of Israel came up to Deborah for judgment. She did not need to announce herself, for moral power was with that woman. "She dwelt under the palm-tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in Mount Ephraim; and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment". Dear brothers and dear sisters, we must rule our own spirit in order that the Holy Spirit may do things in us. I have much more confidence in the instinct of a spiritual sister than in the calculated judgment of the most intelligent brother who is not spiritual. Instinct is the most important thing, and if we are spiritual, our instincts will be true. The children of Israel recognised
{169}
this great quality in Deborah; they came up to her and trusted her judgment.
But all that was not sufficient to crush Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, and his chariots of iron, and his multitude. But it was a great moral basis in view of the defeat of the enemy. She says to Barak, "Hath not Jehovah, the God of Israel, commanded? Go and draw towards mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun, and I will draw unto thee, to the torrent Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, and his chariots and his multitude, and I will give him into thy hand" @Judges 4:6,7. She draws Barak's attention to the commandment of Jehovah: "Hath not Jehovah the God of Israel commanded?" A commandment had been given, and if God commands, we can expect the complete defeat of the enemy, however powerful he may be. I do not wish to speak at length on this victory; I am speaking of the features, the qualities of the judge. These qualities shine beautifully in Deborah. The victory was due to her responding to the commandment of Jehovah: "Hath not Jehovah the God of Israel commanded?" The victory was complete. The result was seen in that "a mother in Israel" arose. Then the highways were established and the villages were no longer forsaken. It says that formerly the travellers on highways went by crooked paths and "the villages ceased in Israel" @Judges 5:7. So you see that the service of Deborah introduced the great divine highways. Now we know where we are going; we no longer follow "crooked paths", for there is a highway. We do not walk blindly. On these highways are the villages in which we enjoy happy fellowship and unity among our brethren. The ministry of Deborah had one great result: it is that there were those who love Jehovah. "Let them that love him be as the rising of the sun in its might" @Judges 5:31.
{170}
Beloved, I might speak longer on this subject, for it includes the whole of the book of Judges. I only wished to point out to you these features in relation to the circumstances in which the testimony is at the present time; these features relate to our circumstances. I lay stress on what is seen in Deborah. If I am to have power among the saints, I must be in spiritual victory and know how to rule my own spirit. The saints will recognise me; I shall be wise, capable of deciding difficult questions between my brethren.
Thus we should be qualified, in view of the day when we shall judge the world and angels.

THE ANOINTED VESSEL (4)
@1 Corinthians 11:17 - 34
-- The particular object that we have in view in considering this epistle is to examine, with the Lord's help, what is the divine thought with regard to each local assembly; that is, that God may have a vessel clothed with dignity by the anointing, a vessel that He can use for the testimony. We have specially in view that passage in chapter 12, where the saints are spoken of under the figure of the human body; they are regarded as "the Christ" (the Anointed), having been "in the power of one Spirit ... baptised into one body", and having been all "given to drink of one Spirit" @1 Corinthians 12:13. Our inquiries have led us as far as chapter 5. We can pass in review the chapters preceding chapter 11.
Yesterday afternoon, at the end of our meeting, we were occupied with the passover and the feast of unleavened bread. The two great features of that feast were set forth at the time of the Lord's death. The passover referred to Himself. So it says, in that chapter 5, that "our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed" (@1 Corinthians 5:7); Christ has been sacrificed *for* us. The feast of unleavened bread is that which corresponds *in* us. So we are enjoined to celebrate the feast, "not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and wickedness, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth" @1 Corinthians 5:8. It was said that in Matthew and Mark, the disciples were eating when the Supper was introduced -- "as they were eating". This epistle speaks of eating, that is to say an act preparatory for the Lord's supper. Unless we eat, that is to say, celebrate the feast of unleavened bread, we shall not be prepared for the Lord's supper.
{172}
-- Should the fact that we must eat in order to be able to take the Lord's supper discourage us?
-- It seems to me that the question of eating ought rather to encourage us, providing it is a matter of celebrating the feast "with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth" @1 Corinthians 5:8. The unbeliever says, "Let us eat and drink; for to-morrow we die" (@1 Corinthians 15:32); while, on the contrary, we eat and drink in order to live.
-- What is the thought of eating unleavened bread?
-- We eat it to avoid being puffed up, but at the same time to maintain spiritual energy.
-- It is not for the flesh, but for the spirit.
-- It produces a spiritual constitution. The Corinthians were puffed up, which shows that they were not celebrating the feast with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. These two things are mentioned in Matthew. When the disciples were eating, the Lord tests them as to the one who would betray Him. "And as they were eating, he said, Verily I say to you, that one of you shall deliver me up" @Matthew 26:21. Such a challenge searches our hearts, for we have very treacherous hearts, and while we might partake of the passover outwardly, we may perhaps have neglected to search our hearts. We do well to acknowledge humbly and solemnly that our hearts are capable of betraying the Lord. The psalmist invites Jehovah to search him, to see if there be any wicked thing in his heart.
-- "Search me, O God, and know my heart; prove me, and know my thoughts; and see if there be any grievous way in me; and lead me in the way everlasting" @Psalm 139:23,24.
-- It says here, "Let a man prove himself". It is necessary for the brethren to examine us, before we are recognised as being in fellowship, but the Lord's challenge implied that each one was to examine himself. "One of you shall deliver me up", (@Matthew 26:21) He says. And each one asks Him, "Is it I, Lord?" So, while
{173}
they were eating, the Lord took bread, and said, "Take, eat; this is my body" @Matthew 26:26.
-- Judas says, "Is it *I*, Rabbi?" And the Lord answers him, "Thou hast said" @Matthew 26:25. But the other disciples were exceedingly grieved, each one asking, "Is it *I* Lord?" @Matthew 26:22. You see the contrast between the one who was eating the passover formally and those who are grieved: these are searched.
-- Life was found with the latter.
-- Each of them said, "Is it *I, Lord*?" while Judas said, "Is it *I, Rabbi*?"
-- Does the feast of the passover form the introduction to the Lord's supper?
-- According to Matthew and Mark, the act of eating precedes the introduction of the Lord's supper, and the Supper is introduced as something to be eaten. In Luke, eating is not spoken of in connection with the Supper; it is a question rather of order, and the Lord's supper is formally separated from the passover. Luke gives us two cups. Matthew and Mark only speak of one cup.
-- How do you explain that eating unleavened bread is a feast?
-- I believe that, in chapter 5, the word is only used in relation to the feast of unleavened bread; it is a term constantly employed in Israel. As to its spiritual meaning, that feast is transferred to the nations; but it is not God's intention that the legal idea should be transferred.
-- I put that question, thinking of that which Mr. C. asked, if it was discouraging to us. I find that on the contrary it should be very encouraging.
-- What is formal is transferred to Christians in its spiritual meaning. The Lord did not intend to transfer to Christians the Jewish feasts, except in their spiritual sense. The only formal sacraments we possess are baptism and the Lord's supper. God never intended that the passover, Pentecost and the
{174}
ascension should be formally recognised among Christians; that is why it does not say, '*the* passover, Christ' -- but "*our* passover, Christ" @1 Corinthians 5:7. That is to say, the apostle is not occupied with the feast in a Jewish or formal way, but he speaks of the passover in its spiritual application, and of that which is spiritually superior to what is material.
-- We have that which we can enjoy every day of the week.
-- In @Deuteronomy 16:3, it says, "Thou shalt eat no leavened bread along with it" -- with the passover -- "seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread with it".
-- The feasts typify what is spiritual, in whatever book of the Old Testament they may be found, and the principle of Deuteronomy is to make things as spiritual as possible. We can understand that at the end of forty years of exercises in the wilderness, the people were more spiritual than at the beginning. We see therefore that the feasts are reduced to three in the book of Deuteronomy; the law itself is reduced, and it is a matter of love. We must grasp the spirit, the spiritual meaning of what is written. And let us not forget that the letter kills, but the Spirit quickens.
-- In Deuteronomy it says that Jehovah loved the people. That is what we can enjoy every day of the week. Our relations one toward the other, during the week, should be on the principle of the unleavened bread. Chapter 5 is occupied with someone who may be called brother and be guilty of one of the sins that are mentioned. The feast of unleavened bread requires us not to mix, not even to eat with such a man. We ought to be distinguished from ordinary people of this world, for the first epistle to the Corinthians views us as being externally in the world. In our everyday relations, we meet all kinds of persons, but it is a question of maintaining the feast of the unleavened bread of truth and sincerity. It
{175}
maintains us, notwithstanding all the unclean persons that we meet, but if one of these persons is called brother, we are not even to eat with him.
-- That raises many serious questions. It is a matter of being able to discern those who are eating unleavened bread and those who are full of leaven.
-- As to what is amongst us, we are responsible to keep a suitable place for the Lord.
-- There are other points which go with the feast of unleavened bread. Chapter 6 takes account of Christians who go to law with one another, even before the unjust. Chapter 7 is occupied with the very complicated question of marriage. Chapter 8 is occupied with idolatry. Chapter 10 resumes the subject of idolatry, specially drawing our attention to the fact that many may outwardly profess Christianity and have part in all its outward privileges, and at the same time become subjects of God's judgment. The apostle fixes our attention on an important principle which governs the Old Testament types, that is, that everything happened for us, for the instruction of those upon whom the ends of the ages are come, to serve for our admonition. Brethren ought to pay very special attention to this. All the ages, all the divine economies point to our position in the assembly.
-- There should be in the assembly something which answers to each of the economies, by reason of the fact that all the divine economies point to our position in the assembly.
-- You are speaking of what was of God in each of the economies. In the Spirit of Christ, what was of God was maintained in each economy.
-- And I think the Lord wished to bring into view what was for God, in the passover cup which He gave to the disciples. All that God had been for them was there livingly in Himself; that is what is in the cup that the Lord gave His disciples. It refers to what was earthly; it was the fruit of the vine "which
{176}
cheers God and man" @Judges 9:13. Now that was to be set aside until the day to come; but nevertheless, they were to divide it among themselves. The essence of the Old Testament was given to them; and in the Old Testament it was not a question only of types and shadows, but of what those types and shadows meant. The Lord was speaking of a very precious reality, when He said, "With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you, before I suffer" @Luke 22:15. He Himself had wept over Jerusalem; His emotions were very real with regard to Jerusalem; and Christians ought to take account of all these things, for they are for us, upon whom the ends of the ages are come.
-- In the book of Exodus the types are particularly presented. But that was not sufficient for God; it was necessary that He should come Himself. His personal movements and what was in His heart in view of the present moment are beyond what is typical.
-- All this was introduced at the last passover. "With desire I have desired to eat *this* passover with you" @Luke 22:15. It was not a formality. The Lord entered into the thing, but that which He did then was to be deferred until a future day. "And having received a cup, when he had given thanks he said, Take this and divide it among yourselves. For I say unto you, that I will not drink at all of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God come" @Luke 22:17,18. All that refers to the passover, and the fact that they were to divide the passover cup among themselves indicates that they were to carry away the spiritual essence of what was in the Old Testament, to maintain the testimony. Therefore, nothing is lost; all is maintained in a spiritual way in the assembly.
-- The ends of the ages came upon them in that cup that He gave to them.
-- At the first ecclesiastical council (Acts 15), there
{177}
were Gentiles and all was to be maintained. They were to abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from blood.
-- It is important for the brethren to understand it, for we see the place of the assembly.
-- We find then the cup which we bless. It is distinct from that of which we have spoken. The cup which we bless is what God is for us.
-- In Corinthians we see the Lord's interests in respect of all the ages. Our affections are developed with regard to His interests in every age.
-- The affections of a wife for her husband go beyond mere responsibility.
-- "The heart of her husband confideth in her" @Proverbs 31:11. The Lord has very vast interests, and we should take care of all His interests.
-- Thus, Rebecca took care of Isaac's tent. She would be for the delight of the heart of Isaac, but he had a tent, and Rebecca took her place there: she took her place in the circle of his interests.
-- We see that the Lord appreciates the testimony that had gone before. It is in the assembly that He can confide; and it is to her that He entrusts all these things. It is beautiful to see how the Lord entrusted His mother to the disciple whom He loved.
-- With regard to the two cups, why does it say that He received the first while He took the second?
-- The original ritual of the passover did not provide a cup. That seems to have been an addition, but the Lord accepts it. Someone evidently passed the cup to Him, and He accepted it, as a suitable way of expressing what was in the feast. But I should like to know what Mr. M. had in his mind with regard to it. Whatever the Lord found that He could accept, He accepted; but when it is a question of His own Supper, all comes from Him. It is not improvised. The Supper is established by Him according to
{178}
design. Thus, the bread and the cup are distinguished in a very definite way in the Lord's supper. The cup is brought before us prominently, so that in @1 Corinthians 10 it is spoken of before the bread. It is introduced, in chapter 10, in a particular way -- "the cup of blessing which we bless" @1 Corinthians 10:16.
-- Is not the second cup mentioned in Luke a mediatorial action in establishing the new covenant?
-- It says that it is "the new covenant in my blood" (@Luke 22:20), which involves mediatorial service. The covenant is made effectual by means of the Mediator. Having dealt with the things that were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come, chapter 10 introduces the subject of fellowship. If we do not understand the subject of fellowship (chapter 10), we shall not enjoy the Lord's supper; chapter 11.
-- His Name must be protected in the fellowship, in chapter 10, before His heart is satisfied, in chapter 11.
-- In these epistles, fellowship is a genitive thought, an idea which proceeds *from* something. In the first chapter, we have the fellowship *of* God's Son. What a dignity! It is the fellowship of God's Son to which we have been called. In this chapter 10, it is the communion (fellowship -- see note) *of* His blood and *of* His body. In the last chapter of the second epistle, it is the communion *of* the Holy Spirit; while in John it is fellowship *with*. "That *ye* also may have fellowship *with* us; and our fellowship is indeed *with* the Father and *with* his Son Jesus Christ" @1 John 1:3. The epistles to the Corinthians are occupied therefore with the character of the fellowship. John brings in the persons with whom we are found in that fellowship.
-- John presents the family, and fellowship with the persons. But the epistle to the Corinthians presents the vessel of the testimony, in connection with the fellowship of God's Son and of the Holy Spirit.
{179}
-- What does "the fellowship of the apostles" (@1 John 1:3) mean?
-- I believe it would imply the authority of Christ resting in the apostles.
-- "They persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers" @Acts 2:42.
-- In our day, Christian fellowship is often spoken of. True Christian fellowship preserves all that is according to God until Jesus comes.
-- I believe it is very important to see that it speaks of the doctrine and fellowship of the apostles, to enforce the authority that had been committed to them. The passage at the end of the second chapter of the Acts shows us how things went immediately after Pentecost; we see how subject those were who had been converted. The work was real in the hearts of those who had believed; they were subject to the authority of Christ which rested in the apostles.
-- Is that why Peter says, in chapter 3 of the Acts, "Look on us" @Acts 3:4?
-- They represented what God was presenting to men in testimony, and what God was doing was to be connected with it. So Peter took the man by the hand; he formed, so to speak, a link with him; later, it says of the lame man who was healed that he "held Peter and John" @Acts 3:11. There were links between the various parts of the work of God and those who were connected with it. In the second chapter, about three thousand souls were *added*, and at the very end of the chapter "the Lord added to the assembly daily those that were to be saved" @Acts 2:47.
-- Why does it not say, in chapter 10, that the bread is the bread of blessing? The cup is called "the cup of blessing" @1 Corinthians 10:16.
-- It is because the bread represents that in which we have been set aside judicially. That does not mean that the bread does not involve blessing. In introducing the cup, the apostle wishes to present that which
{180}
we possess and bless. This cup is greater, more precious, than the passover cup. We appreciate the cup. A godly Israelite would have had a certain appreciation of what God was towards Israel. The Psalms abound in examples showing what God was to a godly Israelite, and God honours these tributes in choosing those which express the glory of His Son. But the Psalms are not on the same level as the hymns of Christians. What treasure we possess in our hymns! They express the glories of God revealed in Christ. I believe that the Christian collection is not as enriched as it might be. The resources that we possess in the Holy Spirit are great enough to render it richer than it is. The things that this cup involves are such that a richer tribute ought to arise to God.
-- You are speaking of our personal hymns, and not only of what is in our collections?
-- Of both. God has honoured the Psalms. He quotes from them in the first chapter of Hebrews, in order to bring out the titles, the dignities, the glory of Christ. All these titles are furnished by the Psalms. God honours our appreciation of Christ as the people of God express it in their psalms. It is as "psalmist" that David is called "man of God".
-- The Psalms are inspired, while our hymns are not inspired; but our thoughts are inspired.
-- Because they were inspired, the Psalms furnished the material which the Holy Spirit could use. The principle of the Psalms is this: "My heart is welling forth with a good matter: I say what I have composed touching the king. My tongue is the pen of a ready writer" @Psalm 45:1.
-- The inspiration of the Psalms was necessary, because the Spirit did not dwell in the godly men of that period.
-- Many psalms and spiritual songs have not been preserved, while the element of inspiration is to be
{181}
observed. David was "the sweet psalmist of Israel" @2 Samuel 23:1. When the ark was brought into its place, he brought in his psalm. He is called "man of God" in connection with that, and we see how God appreciated the tributes of his heart.
-- David composed a psalm in the light of the morning, in the presence of the sun-rising, a morning without clouds. To make one's psalm, one must have Christ before one.
-- And although our expressions are not inspired, we sing by the Spirit and with understanding. All that we have by way of hymns, in whatever language, belong to the whole assembly.
-- Our prayers and hymns are marked by weakness, but behind our hymns and prayers there are things which are far beyond our thoughts.
-- Our comfort is that God reads into our hearts. The spiritual productions which we have in various tongues are the heritage of the whole assembly, and it would be a blessed service if what is of the Spirit were made available to all Christians.
-- David took the dedicated or consecrated things and placed them in the house, and the house includes all saints upon earth.
-- I believe the study of the first book of Chronicles and the beginning of the second would help us much in that respect. David regards Jehovah as Head, indicating that he had the idea of supremacy. And as that book of Chronicles shows, he brought in all that was available, in order that the service of God might be enriched. What was consecrated was employed by him.
Reading with J.T. at Valence, 13th May, 1926, morning.
{182}
THE ANOINTED VESSEL (5)
@1 Corinthians 12:12 - 31
-- At the close of our meeting this morning, we were occupied with the cup. We spoke of what it presented as being a cup of blessing, "the cup of blessing which we bless" @1 Corinthians 10:16. What the apostle had in view in that section was the fellowship. The bearing of chapter 10 is connected with our public relations, for our fellowship involves that we are consistent in what we do, as partaking of the Lord's supper. It involves obligations towards all who are in fellowship. The bread, before it has been broken, represents the unity of the saints. Here it says, "The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of the Christ?" @1 Corinthians 10:16. That is to say the saints universally break the bread. The fellowship is universal, as it is also local. In chapter 11, it says, "As often as *ye* shall eat this bread, and drink the cup, *ye* announce the death of the Lord, until he come" @1 Corinthians 11:26. It is what the Corinthians did locally. But chapter 10 refers to the question of the fellowship in a general way, and what characterises the general fellowship ought to characterise the fellowship in each locality. The same principles and the same customs ought to be found everywhere, according as Paul says, "Thus I ordain in *all* the assemblies" @1 Corinthians 7:17.
-- It is not in chapter 10 but in chapter 11 that it says, "As often as ye shall eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye announce the death of the Lord, until he come" @1 Corinthians 11:26. That supports the thought of the general fellowship in chapter 10, and of the local fellowship in chapter 11.
-- The gathering together is not mentioned in chapter 10, while chapter 11 says, "When ye come therefore together into one place" @1 Corinthians 11:20.
{183}
-- In chapter 10 it is a question of the fellowship in its general bearing. There ought not to be therefore a formal expression of local fellowship without the support of the general fellowship.
-- It says at the beginning of chapter 10, "that *all* our fathers were under the cloud, and *all* passed through the sea; and *all* were baptised unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; and *all* ate the same spiritual food, and *all* drank the same spiritual drink" @1 Corinthians 10:1 - 4. That takes in all the saints in fellowship on earth.
-- Might it not happen sometimes that the local fellowship does not correspond with the general fellowship?
-- Some time ago, I was in a locality where a brother whispered in my ear before the commencement of the meeting for worship, It is our custom to make the collection immediately after the Supper. I agreed with doing that, but I did not agree with the idea of a local custom.
-- I have noticed that, in certain localities, the symbols are covered with a napkin. Where did that custom come from? The twelve stones taken from the Jordan (@Joshua 4) were set up in Gilgal before the eyes of the children of Israel.
-- The memorial ought to be seen; if it is not to be seen, it is not necessary at all.
-- We ought not to follow the customs of those who have not returned to Christian fellowship, although they are Christians.
-- We might have brought with us customs which come from that which we have judged in leaving it. In chapter 16 of Matthew, the Lord left the Pharisees and Sadducees: "And he left them and went away" @Matthew 16:4. But it says that the disciples passed over to the other side, which means that a new position had been taken, and then, the Lord said to them, "See and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees" @Matthew 16:6.
{184}
They had separated from them; moreover, the Lord did not say to them, Beware of the Pharisees and Sadducees. But it was a question of *their leaven* "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees" @Matthew 16:6. We might leave men and carry away their leaven with us, and "a little leaven leavens the whole lump" @1 Corinthians 5:6. We may be outwardly separate from religious organisations, and it might still be that there is not a great difference between us and them, because we have their leaven.
-- In us, everything ought to be new. There is "a new lump": "Purge out the old leaven" (@1 Corinthians 5:7), says the apostle.
-- Where do these customs come from of covering the symbols? From popery?
-- That is all seen, in principle, in the case of the new cart on which David had put the ark; @2 Samuel 6. The most spiritual man of that time himself failed. The idea was a Philistine idea, and God showed by that incident -- the death of Uzza -- how He abhors things that are borrowed from the enemies of His people.
-- In the Roman Catholic system, they adore the Mass. This mysterious covering has a popish character, and the symbols are not in evidence; if they are not in evidence, there is nothing. What are *hidden* symbols?
-- In Egypt, in the Coptic church, the women are separated from the men by a partition. The same is done in our meetings.
-- Chapter 11 shows that it is not a matter of hiding the symbols, but of something that is to be seen. A symbol should typify something.
-- In these last days, the Lord has wrought to cause all these human customs to disappear. He has recovered the truth to us in all its simplicity. The Lord has brought heavenly customs. Do our customs come from heaven? That is the touchstone.
{185}
-- The Lord's supper as we have it is that which the apostle Paul received.
-- He received it from the Lord.
-- Chapter 11 shows the order in which the Supper is celebrated.
-- "In the ordered manner", it says in @Judges 6:26.
-- Chapter 10 speaks of our public relations, that we may be preserved from things which would tend to defile us, idolatry in particular. Chapter 11 speaks of the saints in their more private relations, and in the first place of what is suitable in the man or woman who prays or prophesies, and then what is specially suitable when we are gathered together in assembly, because now it is a question of adornment. It is "the assembly of God" (@1 Corinthians 1:2), and it must not be despised in allowing irregularities.
-- In some localities there is not a whole loaf, but a slice of bread. Is not that an irregularity?
-- The question was raised at Beauvoisin. Someone has remarked that in this version of the Bible it says that the Lord "took bread", which might be taken to justify the practice of using a slice of bread, but the expressions usually employed indicate that the Lord took a whole loaf.
-- In Luke it says "bread".
-- Chapter 10 would govern the position, because it says, "one loaf, one body". "Because we, being many, are one loaf, one body; for we all partake of that *one loaf*" @1 Corinthians 10:17.
-- I do not think that a loaf means a piece or a slice of bread, because, in the same gospel of Luke, it speaks of five loaves.
-- What would be very serious would be to take a slice, taking the assembly as a part of a thing, while in this chapter, and specially in chapter 12, the assembly is one body. "We, being many, are one loaf, one body; for we all partake of that one loaf" @1 Corinthians 10:17.
{186}
-- If there is not a whole loaf on the table (when that is possible) the symbol fails.
-- Matthew says, "And as they were eating, Jesus, having taken the bread and blessed, broke it and gave it to the disciples" @Matthew 26:26.
-- We desire what is correct, what is in order.
-- A slice of bread might be considered as the symbol of a division.
-- Certainly the brethren have not that thought, but others see the thing in that way.
-- It is a question of public testimony, what is before us as a symbol.
-- We have the formal expression, "We, being many, are *one* loaf, *one* body; for we all partake of that one loaf" @1 Corinthians 10:17.
-- The apostle says, "I praise you ... that as I have directed you, ye keep the directions" @1 Corinthians 11:2. The Lord bears with many irregularities among us when the intention is good. But if the Lord has given us certain teaching, we ought to be governed by that teaching, and this is what the apostle has particularly before him in this chapter. He speaks of what is comely in a man who prays or prophesies, and he adds that "if any one think to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the assemblies of God" @1 Corinthians 11:16. He was desirous that the brothers and the sisters should reflect the order of creation when prophesying or praying.
-- It is "on account of the angels" (@1 Corinthians 11:10), is it not?
-- The apostle refers to their gathering, when he says, "In this ... I do not praise" @1 Corinthians 11:17.
-- But he praised them in connection with the directions he had given them.
-- The apostle insists on this point that is essentially important: there must be outward order.
{187}
-- One might consider that it was not absolutely necessary for a woman to be covered, but it is very important before God, because it is the order of creation.
-- Creation itself is introduced to teach us.
-- The Greek word *kosmos* (world) means 'order'.
-- It is not a matter of criticising what is done in certain localities; but what occupies us is that which is comely in the house of God. Formerly, it used to happen in England that one saw four cups on the table. There were no bad intentions in that, but it was not correct, for it only speaks of *one* cup -- *the* cup. It is the same as to the slice of bread for which we would give thanks.
-- The bread and the cup are symbols. If they are covered, they cannot be seen; and if they are not in accord with what is said of them, there is a lack of order. One aspect of the teaching of the Lord's supper is unity, that is to say, that the bread, before it is broken, represents the one body; and the cup is that into which we have all been given to drink, having all been "given to drink of one Spirit".
-- In chapter 11, all that teaching was given to the Corinthians before they gather together in verse 20.
-- You are speaking of the teaching concerning the man and the woman?
-- According to this passage, a woman who prophesies at home ought to have her head covered, likewise if she prays, with her children, for example.
-- Married or unmarried, she stands in relation to the man. The first part of the chapter points out God's order according to nature. The Head of Christ is God. Authority descends, from God to Christ, from Christ to the man, and from the man to the woman. All that exists individually; but in verse 20, it is a question of the saints collectively. It is remarkable to see how God causes the testimony of nature to blend with the testimony of the death of Christ.
{188}
The epistle to the Romans, which corresponds with that to the Corinthians, includes the same thing. There was a testimony, and there is a testimony in nature, and this testimony is reflected in the man and the woman, whether they pray, or whether they prophesy.
-- Is it the means by which God is expressed?
-- In Romans 1, it says that what may be known of God is "apprehended by the mind through the things that are made" @Romans 1:20. In the incarnation, the true relation of God with man is seen clearly; so the Lord, in becoming Man, stood in relation to the creation.
-- @Psalm 104 is the great Psalm relating to nature. "Covering thyself with light as with a garment" @Psalm 104:2. It is what man wears, and man is the vessel of testimony as to the light of God in creation.
-- "Man indeed ought not to have his head covered, being God's image and glory" @1 Corinthians 11:7. That is connected with our position, whether individual or collective. Then there is new creation, where this order does not appear, because in new creation there is neither man nor woman, but it is quite another thing, something entirely new. We find nothing of what we have here when we read Colossians or Ephesians. We are occupied at this moment with teaching that refers to the assembly in a locality, and this teaching is to embrace every testimony given by God in the whole creation. And in the midst of all that, while maintaining the testimony of creation, we announce the death of the Lord until He comes. We maintain the testimony of creation, but we do not live in relation to creation. The light that has come to us has been brought to us by the Lord. Indeed it is in that light that we understand the testimony of creation. The Lord's supper has no reference to what has been produced in creation which is His handiwork as Creator.
{189}
-- It does not say, '*our* Lord', but "*the* Lord". Every man who rejects Jesus rejects the Lord.
-- What renders the testimony so much more important is His rights as Lord, that is to say His rights over every man. As it says, "He is Lord of all" @Acts 10:36. According to this chapter, He is Head of every man; and it is a question of "the death of the Lord" (@1 Corinthians 11:26) not the death of the Head. In presenting Himself as Head, He manifested all that God was, and He has made it available to all men, but the testimony on the cross was not that. The Spirit insists on the inscription that was there: "Jesus the Nazaraean, the king of the Jews" @John 19:19. Men cannot escape from the obligation implied by that inscription. Pilate said to Him, "*Thou* art then a king?" And He answered him, "*Thou* sayest it, that *I* am a king. *I* have been born for this, and for this I have come into the world, that I might bear witness to the truth" @John 18:37. Such was the good confession of Jesus. Our action in eating the bread and drinking the cup is the witness to it. If others wish to hide it, *we* announce it. The assembly does not hide the death of the Lord; on the contrary, she announces it. "Ye announce the death of the Lord, until he come" @1 Corinthians 11:26.
-- "They have taken away *my* Lord" (@John 20:13), said Mary. But Paul says, "*The* Lord".
-- The writing on the cross announced that He was the King; and the world cannot escape its obligations. This fact might involve our death for Him. We stand, so to speak, by the cross. According to John, there were three Marys by the cross. If 'Mary' has any meaning, it must be 'mara', or 'bitterness'.
-- Three witnesses of the bitterness of the death of the Lord.
-- John says that two others were crucified with Jesus, but he does not say that they were robbers.
-- The position is made very clear with regard to Christians, for it says, "As often as ye shall eat
{190}
this bread, and drink the cup, ye announce the death of the Lord, until he come" @1 Corinthians 11:26.
-- It is "ye". The emphasis is on "ye", in contrast with the world.
-- We are publicly identified with a Christ who died in this world. In this verse, it is not a question of recalling Him to our remembrance, but it is to be seen that He has died. It is a question of a dead Christ. The breaking of the bread, that is to say, that which the Lord did Himself, is another thing, a commemorative act. He Himself is thus presented to our hearts.
-- The public testimony is that we announce His death.
-- We assemble together, not only to announce His death, but to remember *Him*.
-- How do we link the collection with that?
-- Up to this point, we are occupied with our position in this world, in the wilderness; and the gifts of the saints are the fruit of their love, having in view the needs of the testimony; so that the collection is quite connected with the symbols.
-- The symbols and the collection are, in themselves, material things; but we finish with that side, in order to pass to another.
-- Then chapter 12 brings the Spirit forward. Chapters 12, 13 and 14 are taken up with the fruit of the Spirit in relation to all these public things. Thus, in these three chapters, 12, 13 and 14, it is a question of the anointed vessel, whence the pre-eminence given to the Holy Spirit.
-- Speaking of the collection, one thinks of the widow who gave the two mites to the temple. One gives to the testimony. The collection is made in relation to the universal needs of the testimony.
-- The teaching that we have regarding the collection refers to the needs in distant localities, which
{191}
brings us to the subject of the general, and not merely local, fellowship.
-- The brethren in Germany have been excessively touched by the thought of the brethren in France who have sent for their needs. It is beautiful to see those of the nations sending money to their needy brethren in Judaea. "And they determined, according as any one of the disciples was well off, each of them to send to the brethren who dwelt in Judaea, to minister to them; which also they did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul" @Acts 11:29,30.
-- The first cause of murmuring in the assembly was that the widows of the Hellenists were neglected. National feeling was one of the first features of defection in the assembly, while that feeling was fully overcome at Antioch in the freshness of the Spirit.
-- When we have the symbols, the Lord is before us, is He not? "Christ also loved the assembly, and has delivered himself up for it" (@Ephesians 5:25); that is what we have in the bread and the cup. Then, with regard to the collection, we act like the Lord, in love, and we are not thinking only of local needs, but of all the saints.
-- It is very beautiful to see how the apostle unfolds this principle of giving. He shows that those who carried the collection of the brethren at Corinth were "Deputed messengers of assemblies, Christ's glory" @2 Corinthians 8:23. It is another heavenly custom given by the Lord; and the apostle concludes his subject by these words: "Thanks be to God for his unspeakable free gift" @2 Corinthians 9:15. I find the collection raised to quite an elevated level.
-- The Lord said, "It is more blessed to give than to receive" @Acts 20:35.
-- The Lord left this scene sacrificing Himself, and if the saints are going to disappear into their spiritual
{192}
domain, their last public act should be on the ground of sacrifice.
-- It is very interesting to see, in the gospel of Luke, the place material things have in chapter 16, after the reception of the prodigal son in chapter 15. The rich man who lived luxuriously was living for himself; he is seen in his affairs. The unrighteous steward made use of what was to his hand in view of the future. It says that the lord praised that steward because he had done prudently. Then, we have Zacchaeus who was rich and who gave the half of his goods to the poor; @Luke 19. The Lord acknowledged him as a son of Abraham. Later, we have the widow who gave to God all the living that she had; @Luke 21. So, in the gospel of Luke, the Holy Spirit takes account particularly of gifts.
-- Again, Joseph of Arimathaea is spoken of (@Luke 23), who was a rich man. He devoted himself to the testimony in the day of the greatest reproach.
-- There must be a liberal spirit.
-- "For God loves a cheerful giver" @2 Corinthians 9:7.
-- "It is more blessed to give than to receive" @Acts 20:35.
Reading with J.T. at Valence, 13th May, 1926, afternoon.
{193}
THE RESULT OF A SPIRITUAL EXERCISE
@Hebrews 11:5; @Jude 14; @Psalm 133; @Psalm 134; @Psalm 135:19 - 21
I have chosen Enoch as showing the result of a spiritual exercise. It says that he was the seventh from Adam, and what is seen in him, as being the seventh from Adam, is that he pleased God.
A spiritual exercise is the result of light established in the soul. There had been an apostasy in the line of Cain. The result of the fall of Adam and Eve, as we see it in the fourth chapter of Genesis, presents a very dark picture of pride, lust and violence. But a son was born to Seth; and Seth, in naming his son, indicated that he accepted the judgment of God upon man as the consequence of sin. He had light. In other words, he gave his son the name of Enosh, which means 'Mortal man'. He had not been deceived by the longevity of the men of his time. He recognised that his descendants must die; and after that it is said, "Then people began to call on the name of Jehovah" @Genesis 4:26. Light had been brought in. It had come by means of Seth; and in consequence others were enlightened. We see therefore how light spreads; it spreads from one to another. In Cain's line, the name of men was considered as having importance; and it is always so with those who live far from God. Cain built a city and gave it the name of his son. But light having been brought in, "people began to call on the name of Jehovah" (@Genesis 4:26); and in that light, Adam is, so to speak, restored. We have therefore the line of Adam, passing through Seth, and in that line Enoch is the seventh -- "the seventh from Adam". It covered a long period of years; but in each of Adam's descendants, including Adam himself
{194}
and Seth, the light which the name of Enosh involves is found to be confirmed: each of them died. Men were not to be deceived by the fact that they lived a long time; the judgment of God is sure, and by that judgment He confirms the light that He has given to His people, however aged they might be (some of them reached nearly a thousand years). The testimony is that they died, and that testimony was so to say imposed upon men. But Enoch is the seventh. His name means that he was disciplined. He did not make light of the governmental ways of God. He observed them, and when a son was born to him, he walked with God for three hundred years. What a life his was, beloved! A life that covered three centuries! Every day, during those three centuries, we may say he walked with God. During those years, those three hundred years, his faith was increasing; his vision was becoming clearer; he prophesied, and in his prophesy he was occupied with the holy myriads. He was accustomed to having to do with ungodly myriads. Nobody could undertake to compute the population of that time. The antediluvian world must have been very populous, but there were myriads who were not holy. It was a wicked generation; there were heroes in those days, men of renown, giants. Thus, the earth was corrupt before God. Valiant men led their fellow men without regard to the rights of God. They were therefore unholy myriads; and this disciplined man, this man who walked with God, had to prove the terrible character of the corruption. He had to enter into the thoughts of God with regard to it, but Jude says that he saw the Lord coming with His "holy myriads", and it is these myriads who are going to deal with the unholy myriads. As to communion with the men of this earth, there was little or indeed none at all, for, as we see later, the men of faith in Genesis had to walk alone. So walked Noah, and Abraham, and Isaac.
{195}
and Jacob, and Joseph. These men learned to walk alone with God; but we see in this great prototype of what was to follow, that *he pleased God*.
So, dear brethren, he is a type of those who would follow him in the path of spiritual exercise flowing from light given. In the days in which we live great light has been given; a spiritual exercise has come to light and has continued; and, thank God, it has greatly spread. But if this exercise is of God, it must correspond with the beginning of the dispensation, for God never gives up any of His thoughts. If He did not find in the garden of Eden an Adam with whom He could walk, He nevertheless found an Enoch. And as the dispensation began with the brethren, so also it will close with the brethren. Such is the divine way.
I referred to @Psalm 133. This psalm has its place at the end of a spiritual exercise. It is the last but one of the Songs of Degrees. The Songs of Degrees are evidently the product of spiritual exercises; they follow in a suitable order, not only numerically, but also as to their contents. They express the exercises of the earthly people of God in a day to come, as a consequence of light given. They begin at @Psalm 120 and finish at @Psalm 134. I cannot undertake to go into these psalms in detail; but they express one by one the exercises of the people of God, in a coming day, from the place of their captivity to the sphere of divine blessing and purpose. The ministry of John is intended particularly to cover the present days; that is why in his writings the idea of the family is developed. There is nothing more precious in the Scriptures than the thought of the family; it is a primary idea, and what is primary, for God, is eternal. Therefore in the gospel of John we find the Father's house. We are going to be received eternally into the Father's house -- a place prepared for us. So, in chapter 20, the brethren are
{196}
presented: "Go to my brethren" @John 20:17. He who describes them as such is He who ascends into the heavens. You see that the thought of brethren is connected with the ascension, even in the passages to which I have referred. The culminating point of ascension is the place of the brethren, so that in @John 20 the Lord sends the message as the One who ascends to the Father: "Go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and your Father, and to my God, and your God" @John 20:17. That is, so to speak, the great terminus of John's ministry, and on that platform -- the platform of brethren, as one may call it -- is developed at the present moment, as will be developed in the future, all that relates to God. Every feature of the service of God is developed, as well as the thought of the family; that is an eternal thought; still it is seen here, in the sphere of testimony which is a means used to attain a certain end. It is there that God finds sympathy with all His thoughts. We are not therefore merely to rest in these blessed affections which we appreciate; if we do not see that the family is the means by which, at the present time, God develops His purpose, we shall fail to lay hold of His thoughts.
Beloved brethren, let us enjoy to the full brotherly affections. That is only to anticipate eternity; but there are the divine thoughts in testimony. Where is God to seek them, if it is not in His family? He desires that we may have free priestly access. If I am in the family, I am a son; I am in liberty; and I ought to be a priest. The son implies liberty. The priest is watchful as to the reverence that is due to God. The priest requires that every divine thought is conformed to. It is to him that the law is committed. He will have the law; he will insist upon every principle that should govern the house of God; he will have consideration for what is of God; he will be concerned with the maintenance of order;
{197}
he will require that all that is public shall be according to God.
I might enlarge on all the details concerning the public service and testimony, and draw attention to the priests who watch over each of those details, as it is spoken of in the prophet Malachi, "And now, ye priests, this commandment is for you" @Malachi 2:1. Then He refers to Levi, saying, "My covenant with him was of life and peace, and I gave them to him that he might fear; and he feared me, and trembled before my name. The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity. For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and at his mouth they seek the law; for he is the messenger of Jehovah of hosts" @Malachi 2:5 - 7. I have referred to the side of the priests, because it depends on that of the family. I do not suppose that we shall have need of it in eternity, for nothing will be lawless, or out of order, or wanting in holiness, but it is necessary here where all these things exist.
According to Psalm 134, you will see how all that I have said is introduced. @Psalm 133 is the family, and that psalm is very beautiful. I have rejoiced, dear brethren, in the brotherly affections I have found in this country. It is the anticipation of eternity -- the love of the brethren. The Spirit of God compares it here to wonderful things. First, it is "Like the precious oil upon the head". Affections in the family of God do not originate on earth: they flow from the Head; they come from above. It is not what is at present developed among men: liberty, equality, fraternity. Brethren who dwell together in unity are compared to the oil on the head. Whose head? The head of Christ typified in Aaron. How intimately is the priestly order linked with the family, for the family is connected with the priestly order as having been anointed! So the oil runs down upon the beard
{198}
and down to the hem of the garments. Then it is compared to "the dew of Hermon". It is again a matter of something which comes down from above. It is the exact opposite of what is current among men. All that is from above has been honoured. In face of the present state of things God insists on His testimony that brethren dwelling together in unity are like that which comes from above. The Lord said, "*Ye* are from beneath; *I* am from above" @John 8:23. We are thus depicted by the Spirit of God as resembling these wonderful figures, the blessing of which has been commanded, "for there hath Jehovah commanded the blessing, life for evermore". Such is the result of divine and sovereign purposes and counsels!
From the following psalm I wish to show you how the service of God depends on that. It speaks of those who, in the nights, stand in the house of Jehovah. It is not exactly a question of family enjoyment, although that thought is there at the bottom. In the enjoyment of those affections we stand "*in the nights*". We forgo our comforts in order that the service of God may be maintained in His house during the night. The question arises for us, Do we maintain the service of God during the night? We know how the eyes become heavy during the night. Peter, James and John went to sleep on the mount of Transfiguration, and then also at Gethsemane. "Thus ye have not been able to watch one hour with me?" (@Matthew 26:40) the Lord asked them. Family affections are extremely precious and the disciples had enjoyed them at the Supper. But they are now at Gethsemane. Can we watch one hour with the Lord? These things have a voice to us, dear brethren. But what a great favour! We have the privilege of standing in the nights to maintain the service in a priestly way. Nothing is to hinder the service of the house. The darkness thickens more and more, but we still maintain the service.
{199}
"Behold, bless Jehovah, all ye servants of Jehovah, who by night stand in the house of Jehovah. Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless Jehovah!"
What we see in @Psalm 148 is the maintenance of the divine praise. Our hearts are filled with praise, reading these wonderful psalms. The praise is maintained in an extremely beautiful way. "Praise Jehovah from the heavens; praise him in the heights. Praise ye him, all his angels; praise ye him, all his hosts. Praise him, sun and moon; praise him, all ye stars of light. Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that are above the heavens" @Psalm 148:1 - 4. You see that, beloved brethren! You see the extent of that which is called upon to praise Him. Is the Psalmist occupied with his own enjoyment? He is so impressed with God that he appeals to the whole creation -- heavens and earth -- to praise Him. What feeling he had for Jehovah! What a tribute for Jehovah! So, dear brethren, I believe that is what God proposes at the present moment. If John's ministry is effectual, it leads the family, it leads the brethren into their most exalted relations. The brethren possess the Holy Spirit. If the Holy Spirit is free to act, He will produce what the Psalms present to us; that is to say, the service of God will be maintained in the most exalted manner, and I believe the present dispensation will finish thus.
In @Psalm 135, those who are responsible are called upon to praise. "House of Israel, bless ye Jehovah; house of Aaron, bless ye Jehovah; House of Levi, bless ye Jehovah; ye that fear Jehovah, bless Jehovah. Blessed be Jehovah out of Zion, who dwelleth at Jerusalem! Hallelujah!"
Who are those who have the Spirit of God? "*House of Israel, bless ye Jehovah*!" There are thousands of those who possess the Spirit of God who are occupied with earthly things, but the appeal,
{200}
the command, is addressed to them all: "Bless Jehovah!"
"*House of Aaron, bless ye Jehovah*!" These same persons are really priests. All those who have received the Spirit are priests. They belong to the house of Aaron; but do they exercise their priestly functions?
They are called upon to exercise them.
"*House of Levi, bless ye Jehovah*!" It is a question here of those who are in active service. Many among us, alas! are thinking of the success of their own service. It is good to be exercised that our service may produce fruit, but that is not all. "House of Levi, bless ye Jehovah!"
Then, "*Ye that fear Jehovah, bless Jehovah*!"
And finally it says, "*Blessed be Jehovah out of Zion, who dwelleth at Jerusalem! Hallelujah*!"
You see, dear brethren, the marvellous end of an exercise produced by divine light, whether we apply it to our times, or whether we apply it to the remnant of Israel in a day to come. God takes pleasure among the brethren; it is among the brethren that the service is carried on; and the testimony of God is maintained in them.
Address by J.T. at Valence, 13th May, 1926, evening.
{201}
THE ANOINTED VESSEL (6)
1 Corinthians 11:17 - 34
-- The desire of the brethren is that we should have a reading. At Valence we were occupied with the first epistle to the Corinthians. I was thinking that it would be good to pursue the consideration of that book, and to speak of the Lord's supper in chapter 11: we will read verses 17 to 34.
Yesterday, in our consideration of this subject, we referred to chapter 10, verse 15 and onwards, as treating of the fellowship. It speaks of the cup of the Lord's supper as being the communion of the blood of the Christ, and it is said of the bread that it is the communion of the body of the Christ. The bearing of chapter 10 refers to our conduct every day of the week. Chapter 11 gives us light as being gathered together in assembly. In chapter 10, we are to be consistent with the fellowship. In our daily life we are responsible to be consistent with the death of the Lord; and the bread, in the Lord's supper, represents not only Christ's body, but all saints. We are therefore responsible towards all the saints, in our daily life. It says that, "we, being many, are one loaf, one body; for we all partake of that one loaf" @1 Corinthians 10:17. So, as partaking of the bread, we are responsible to be consistent with the death of Christ; and we are responsible, not only to Him, but to all the saints. We must therefore be ready, if need be, to give account of our behaviour to the saints. To stress that principle, Paul says again, "Ye cannot drink the Lord's cup, and the cup of demons: ye cannot partake of the Lord's table, and of the table of demons" @1 Corinthians 10:21. If we make light of these instructions, the Lord will have something to say to us as to it. So it says, "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?
{202}
are we stronger than he?" @1 Corinthians 10:22. We see therefore that Christendom, in general, in departing from these instructions, will have to do with the Lord, and those who do not observe His rights will see that the Lord is stronger than they.
-- He has acquired His rights over us at such a price, that we can well understand the jealousy of His love which does not allow the presence of a rival.
-- In the second epistle it is said that we have been espoused to one Man. "I am jealous as to you with a jealousy which is of God; for I have espoused you unto one man, to present you a chaste virgin to Christ" @2 Corinthians 11:2. The Lord Jesus Christ is jealous; He does not wish our affections to be divided. If therefore, whether in secret or otherwise, we are linked with the world, while partaking of the Lord's supper, we shall be disciplined by the Lord. In the letter to the angel of the assembly in Thyatira, where the Lord's rights had been denied, He speaks as "Son of God, he that has his eyes as a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass" @Revelation 2:18. In that assembly, the rights that the Lord had over the affections of His own had been denied. As our brother has just said, the Lord has established His rights over our affections through death, and where His rights have been refused Him, He speaks as "The Son of God, he that has his eyes as a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass" (@Revelation 2:18), which means that He will execute judgment.
-- The jealousy of the Lord is what preserves us, that He may have no rival. "Set me as a seal upon thy heart, As a seal upon thine arm: For love is strong as death; Jealousy is cruel as Sheol: The flashes thereof are flashes of fire, Flames of Jah" @Song Of Songs 8:6.
{203}
-- The Lord will deal with the profession around us in the severest manner, because the rights of His love have been refused Him. But, as I said, we have also to do with the saints, because the fellowship is, so to speak, a partnership; those who are in partnership know very well that all the partners are responsible to one another. The brethren have therefore the right to ask us to give account of our conduct; they have also the right to exercise discipline if required. In chapter 5 we are enlightened as to the authority which the assembly possesses; in order to execute discipline, as being gathered together, they have the Lord with them. Paul said that he had judged already to deliver to Satan that person who had sinned, for destruction of the flesh, "that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus" @1 Corinthians 5:5. We have not now the assembly as it existed at Corinth, for the public body has failed, nevertheless, the responsibility of exercising discipline rests upon us, and the Lord will always be with the twos or threes dealing with evil which manifests itself. Otherwise, all would be corrupted by the leaven of wickedness. And the apostle continues, "But now I have written to you, if any one called brother be fornicator, or avaricious, or idolater, or abusive, or a drunkard, or rapacious, not to mix with him; with such a one not even to eat" @1 Corinthians 5:11. With such, the saints are not even to eat. In that way, this epistle teaches us how we may remain pure and be rid of leaven. All these observations relate to the question of fellowship, and what this epistle says of it shows how that fellowship is worthy of being preserved from all evil. In the first chapter it says that we have been called into the fellowship of God's Son. In chapter 10, we have part in the fellowship of the death of Christ - "the communion of the blood of the Christ" (@1 Corinthians 10:16) and "the communion of the body of the Christ" @1 Corinthians 10:16. In the last chapter of the second epistle we have the communion
{204}
of the Spirit of God. Those are infinitely precious things, dear brethren, things which it is absolutely necessary to preserve with the greatest vigilance on the part of us all. To lay stress on these thoughts we have, in chapter 5, the feast of unleavened bread. It says that "our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed" @1 Corinthians 5:7. That was His personal part, and what a part! It involved that He was forsaken by God. Our corresponding part is to provide the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Thus the feast is celebrated which continues every day of the week; and it is in eating the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth that we are made fit to partake of the Lord's supper. In Matthew and Mark, it says that it was while the disciples were eating the passover that the Lord's supper was introduced. It says, "And as they were eating, Jesus, having taken bread" @Mark 14:22. So these chapters 5 and 10 of the first epistle to the Corinthians are occupied with the celebration of the feast of unleavened bread.
-- Is the unleavened bread the appropriation of Christ?
-- In Christ, sincerity and truth have had their most complete expression. In the Lord's walk there was nothing that was not absolutely true and sincere. So, in us, the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth corresponds to Christ.
-- Would you say that the passover presents the objective side, while the unleavened bread the subjective side?
-- Very good. We provide the unleavened bread now. From the outset, the believer begins to provide unleavened bread. All who desire fellowship with the saints should possess unleavened bread; they should show that they are sincere, and that what they desire to do is not with the object of imitating others. When the children of Judah and Benjamin came to David, David went out to meet them, and
{205}
he throws out a challenge to their hearts. "If ye come peaceably to me to help me, my heart shall be knit unto you; but if to betray me to mine enemies, seeing there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers see it and rebuke it" @1 Chronicles 12:17. If we do not come with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth, we shall betray the Lord sooner or later. Unleavened bread tends to keep us humble and small. Unleavened bread would thus characterise all our readings and all our preachings and all our communications with one another. A person who eats unleavened bread will not vaunt himself. He will not wish to appear great in the eyes of others. The Lord's model for the kingdom was "a little child". We are to retain the character of the little child during our whole life down here.
-- Perhaps it would be good if you would dwell further on the unleavened bread and its meaning for us.
-- Leaven, in Scripture, is a figure of what inflates. It is what characterises men in the world. Men naturally have the desire to appear great in the eyes of others, and to attain their end, they sacrifice sincerity and truth. In this respect, there is much dishonesty among men; there is much flattery. All these things are leaven.
-- And it is the world that produces it.
-- The Lord said, speaking of His disciples, "They are not of the world, as *I* am not of the world" @John 17:16. So the believer is maintained in correspondence to Christ by eating unleavened bread. He maintains sincerity and truth in all his circumstances and in all his relations. He does not cause trouble among his brethren because he is happy to be the least. The Lord said, "Whosoever would be great among you, shall be your minister; and whosoever would be first of you shall be bondman of all" @Mark 10:43,44. It is after this manner that we are together to eat the Lord's supper.
{206}
We are in correspondence with the Lord. So we are prepared to partake of that which shows His love for us.
-- We are the little flock, and the Lord said, "Fear not, little flock" @Luke 12:32.
-- In chapter 53 of Isaiah, it speaks of the Lord; it says that there was no guile in His mouth, and immediately God salutes Him as "my righteous servant" @Isaiah 53:11. One must be without guile, if one would serve according to God.
-- And now, answering to that spirit of humility, the saints gather together. In those who are small God would display what He considers as being great and marked by dignity. So therefore, before the saints are viewed as met together, we have, in chapter 11, teaching which applies to the saints in their houses, that is to say, order according to God in creation, now that Christ has become Man. It says, "I wish you to know that the Christ is the head of every man, but the woman's head is the man, and the Christ's head God" @1 Corinthians 11:3. God preserves thus His public order, now that Christ has become Man. It is by observing this section of our chapter that we shall be preserved, in our houses, from the spirit that characterises the world at the present moment -- the spirit that would set aside all authority that comes down from above.
-- God, in the children of wisdom, vindicates Christ as the One who, at each step of His path, depended on His Head, God.
-- We shall not be in the assembly as the body of Christ, unless there is in us correspondence with the teaching of the first part of this chapter. Sometimes a clerical spirit is shown among the saints; but we shall learn to live in subjection, if we see that the Christ is the Head of every man, and that the man is the head of the woman, and that God is the Head of Christ. This order will be seen in the millennium,
{207}
because God will have taken away all lawlessness; but at present, lawlessness remains in the world, and God desires to present now in the saints in testimony that which will be seen later, during the millennium. So, *each* brother, in his own house, takes the place of head; he confesses thus that Christ is his own Head, and that God is Christ's Head. Wisdom comes down then from God through Christ, and through the man, who is head in his house. And the woman, recognising man as her head, herself also expresses this wisdom. The divine order is seen in the saints, although it is not yet seen in the world. The man ought to be uncovered when praying or prophesying, and the woman ought to be covered, as a sign of subjection, and that not only for the eyes of men, but for the eyes of angels.
-- "On account of the angels" (@1 Corinthians 11:10), it says.
-- The testimony of God in us is not only for the world, but also for the angels.
-- What is the sense of the expression, "the *Lord's* supper"?
-- The word is only used twice, the first time in this passage, and the second time in the Revelation, where we have "the Lord's day" (@Revelation 1:10) (or "the dominical or lordly day" -- see note, @Revelation 1:10). In each passage it is a question of the Lord's authority. That expression is used here because the Corinthians had set aside the Lord's authority in the way in which they were observing the Supper. They were coming together for the worse. It is a sad thing if, in gathering together, we lose, when we ought to gain much. And the apostle Paul observes that the cause of it was that there existed divisions among them. One of the evidences of division was that each was taking his own supper: one was hungry and another drank to excess. They considered the occasion of the Lord's supper as an ordinary occasion of eating and drinking. They were eating and drinking to excess.
{208}
-- It is evident that in our day the saints would not do anything so gross, but we might all the same meet together in a party spirit.
-- A man who was eating his own supper before others was selfish; he was eating to excess and allowing his brother to be hungry. Although these gross things are not done now, we might nevertheless meet in a selfish way; if, for example, a brother takes the whole meeting into his own hands, he shuts out others. The basic principle of the Lord's supper is mutuality.
-- Nobody ought to be specially distinguished.
-- When the saints met together at Troas, Paul was with them. It does not say, 'Paul and his company being assembled', but "We being assembled to break bread" @Acts 20:7. Paul, among them, was as one of them. It is true that afterwards he made a discourse, but that was in his apostolic capacity, and that discourse had a prophetic bearing; but the brethren had met together, Paul among them, to break bread. It is a question therefore of mutuality, and each brother here present ought to be free to take part according to his measure. The sisters are to remain silent, according to this chapter; nevertheless, they partake of the Supper like the brothers.
-- But we must not forget to eat the unleavened bread, in order to be suitable.
-- We assemble "to break bread". But in assembling thus, we are already eating, for we keep the feast of unleavened bread.
-- Immediately before the passage that we were quoting from the Acts, it says, "after the days of unleavened bread" (@Acts 20:6); each had partaken of unleavened bread; it is mutuality.
-- I believe that what we have said as to unleavened bread helps us much when we meet together. No brother claims to be great, and in partaking of the Supper, he does not shut out others. At the end of
{209}
the chapter it says, "When ye come together to eat, wait for one another". There were other things which were to be adjusted; the apostle does not adjust them in writing; he will set them in order when he comes to them. It reminds us how great was the need of order in the assembly. The Lord's supper has been the greatest cause of controversy among Christians, and all kinds of absurdities have enveloped it. In a great religious system, the Supper has been carried to such a point that it has become an object of idolatrous worship. In another, it has been so obscured by human innovations that it can no longer be recognised. Concerning all these observations, we can only say, "It is not to eat the Lord's supper". If the apostle had to say that to the Corinthians, how much more does that apply to the religious organisations of our day. But he says, "I received from *the Lord*, that which I also delivered to you". There was no addition. That which the Lord did in the room at Jerusalem is what He communicated to Paul. So it was with the ark of the covenant, when David set it at Jerusalem. The ark had passed through the hands of the Philistines, but nevertheless it contained the tables of the covenant; nothing had been added. It was preserved in its original simplicity, as a type of the Lord Jesus Christ. Likewise, the Lord's supper was presented to the Corinthians as the Lord Himself had instituted it.
-- As the ark had been preserved intact, although it had been in enemy hands, so the Lord's supper is found in our hands in our day, freed from every human innovation.
-- We have no hesitation in saying that we possess it as the Lord gave it to Paul. And how important it is for us to preserve it from every human innovation! It is a memorial that the Lord has Himself instituted; that is why the apostle Paul says, "*I* received from the Lord, that which I also delivered to you, that the
{210}
Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was delivered up, took bread, and having given thanks broke it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me. In like manner also the cup, after having supped, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as ye shall eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye announce the death of the Lord, until he come". There is the Supper in its simplicity as it was given to Paul! And I believe it is right to compare it to the ark as David established it at Zion. The ark had been in the house of a certain man, Obed-Edom, but it did not belong to a man's house. Its place was in the holiest, in the tabernacle or the temple. So, in this chapter, Paul distinguishes between our houses and the assembly. He places the Lord's supper in relation to the assembly; he separates it formally from ordinary meals in a believer's house. The Lord's supper therefore is not an ordinary meal; it is a memorial having a spiritual significance. Now, it is for us to consider if what has been given to us is kept and preserved from all local custom, from all routine, from all human innovation. Paul said, "And thus I ordain in all the assemblies" @1 Corinthians 7:17. Therefore, wherever I go, I ought to see the Lord's supper entirely free from local customs; the same order, down to its smallest details, ought to characterise it in each locality. There should be *only one loaf*, and *only one vessel* containing what is to be drunk.
-- The breaking of bread recalls to us our Lord Jesus Christ. He said, "This do in remembrance of *me*".
-- A piece of bread would not set out the thought of "one loaf", would it?
-- That seems to me quite clear. A piece of bread is a part of a thing. That would rather suggest a division. Several of the sects in Christendom pretend
{211}
to be part of a whole; but in the face of such a suggestion the apostle says, "Is the Christ divided?" @1 Corinthians 1:13. So, a piece of bread reminds us rather of these divisions, instead of what is one whole. In these epistles the assembly is viewed as "one body", and the human body is a figure. Every human body is an organism complete in itself. The assembly is a complete organism. Therefore a piece of bread could not correctly symbolise the body. For that, a whole loaf is necessary.
-- What is the meaning of these words: "Not distinguishing the body"?
-- I believe that refers to Christ's body. In chapter 16 of Matthew, we have a reference to bread. The disciples reasoned among themselves saying, Because we have taken no bread. The Lord had warned them against the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees, "and they reasoned among themselves, saying, Because we have taken no bread" @Matthew 16:7. The Lord says to them, "Why reason ye among yourselves, O ye of little faith, because ye have taken no bread?" @Matthew 16:8. The disciples were themselves the bread. On their part, it was unbelief to wish to carry material bread. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees would be in danger of inflating them. So the Lord speaks of "the five loaves" @Matthew 16:9. He was not speaking at all of material bread, but He was speaking of them, and, pursuing the thought of the leaven, they themselves were to form the bread which was in danger of being inflated by the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. And we read in the tenth chapter of Corinthians: "We, being many, are one loaf, one body; for we all partake of that one loaf" @1 Corinthians 10:17.
-- Would you tell us what is the difference between Luke and this epistle? In Luke, it says, "This is my body which is *given for you*" (@Luke 22:19), and in Corinthians, "This is my body, which is *for you*".
-- I believe that in Luke, the Lord wished to bring
{212}
out the thought that His body was sacrificed for them. There is another translation which says, This is my body which is broken for you; that is to say, that it is for our enjoyment, as it says again, "Take this: this is my body" @Mark 14:22.
-- If we have the thought of the Lord, there are no divisions in the body of Christ.
-- Why are there so many Christians, in our meetings, who abstain from the Supper?
-- Do you ask them sometimes why they do not break bread? They ought to be able to answer that question.
-- Do you not think that the first part of the tenth chapter is not realised? The state of soul is not suitable.
-- With persons whom I know to be Christians, I always seize the opportunity to put the question to them, Why? I sometimes ask them, Why should you be the last to bring king David back to his house? David had been rejected. Now the men of Judah are ready to bring him back, according him his place. The Lord has a right to my heart, and if others have opened their heart to Him, why should I be the last to open my heart to Christ? The Lord's supper is the appointed way for calling Him to remembrance, in order that He may have His place in my heart. Do you not think that would help Christians who do not break bread, if one raised this question in their heart? Another thing: Why should I keep the Lord waiting? He says, "Behold, I stand at the door and am knocking" @Revelation 3:20. Why should I leave the Lord at the door? Why not open the door? Why not let Him come in? "If any one hear my voice and open the door, I will come in unto him and sup with him, and he with me" @Revelation 3:20. I think those who are outside the circle have shut the door to the Lord. It may be they have love for Him, but they do not give evidence of it. In the Song of Songs, the spouse says, "Why
{213}
should I be as one veiled beside the flocks of thy companions?" @Song Of Songs 1:7. Her love for the Lord was doubtful. Also He says, "If thou know not, thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds¬ booths" @Song Of Songs 1:8. She was to follow the footsteps of the flock. She wanted to know where the Lord was, because she wanted to be near Him. That is why she is told to take her place by the footsteps of the flock and to feed beside the shepherds¬ booths. Then, she says, "While the king is at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth its fragrance. A bundle of myrrh is my beloved unto me; he shall pass the night between my breasts" @Song Of Songs 1:12,13. The Lord is now her Object; and I think that those who have affection for the Lord, but who do not partake of the Lord's supper, cause us to infer that they have doubts.
-- They cannot testify to the reality of their affection in answering to His desires.
-- "He that has my commandments and keeps them, *he* it is that loves me" @John 14:21. The Lord died for me, and He desires that I should remember Him in that way. If I do not announce His death, I am not observing His commandments, for it says, "As often as *ye* shall eat this bread, and drink the cup, *ye* announce the death of the Lord, until he come". It does not say merely that the death of the Lord is announced, but *ye* announce it. That must be carefully noticed: it is *you* who announce it. Those who do not break bread have no part in it. They may say that the Lord died for them, but they do not announce His death.
-- In that the Lord loses something; and we also lose something. There is sometimes a little timidity, and in that case there would be need to encourage.
-- The fault is perhaps with those who break bread, if they do not encourage their brethren.
-- If I "go ... forth by the footsteps of the flock" (@Song Of Songs 1:8),
{214}
I shall be encouraged by the fact that there are others. It is very sad that those who are Christians here, may not be included in the "we" and "ye" of this chapter.
-- Partaking of the Supper may be regarded as answering to the Lord's commandments.
Reading with J.T. at La Varenne (Haute-Loire), 14th May, 1926, afternoon.
{215}
THE ANOINTED VESSEL (7)
@1 Corinthians 12
-- In our reading yesterday afternoon we read part of chapter 11. We considered the question of fellowship and the Lord's supper. We remarked that the celebration of the feast of unleavened bread, spoken of in chapter 5, preserves us from being inflated. Leaven is what inflates. Unless we celebrate the feast of unleavened bread, we shall be selfish. In such circumstances, the part that we might take in the assembly will have in view our personal importance, while the unleavened bread is intended to keep us humble, and we can thus consider others as better than ourselves. It says that at Corinth, when they came together, certain were taking their own supper before others. The one who was doing that was not considering the others; he was selfish. As we were saying yesterday, we have not, in our days, the gross things spoken of in that chapter; but nevertheless, it might be that a brother only thinks of himself, not taking account of others, in the part that he takes in the assembly. So it says, at the end of the chapter "When ye come together to eat, wait for one another" @1 Corinthians 11:33. Waiting for one another implies consideration for one another. If I wait for my brethren, I give them liberty, and they have opportunity to take part. If each one is governed by this principle of waiting for one another, each one will also be able to act. Being freed from ourselves, and delivered from our own importance, the Lord's supper has its voice to remind us that the Lord Jesus devoted Himself for us even to death. So there is developed what we learn in chapter 12. The members function in their relative place; and there are no divisions in the body.
{216}
Thus the body becomes a vessel for Christ and for God.
-- In chapter 11, we serve Him in love, according to the desires of His heart. In chapter 12, we are collectively a vessel which is at His disposal for testimony. It is impossible to be *for* Him according to chapter 12, if we are not *to* Him in chapter 11.
-- We can see how the Spirit of Christ is developed in unity, when we sit down together to take the Supper, corresponding to that which the gospel of Luke presents in our Lord Himself.
-- A Vessel anointed with the Spirit.
-- The Lord said, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach glad tidings to the poor ..." @Luke 4:18. We see how the anointing, in the case of the Lord, led Him to be occupied in the first place with the poor. The natural man is not occupied with the poor. The apostle speaks of the one who takes his *own* supper before others, and who drinks to excess, but he also says, There is one who is hungry. It may even be that one of them has not a house. The one who has not a house, nor food, belongs to the poor. Thus, the spirit of the anointing was not in evidence at Corinth. However, it is said to us elsewhere, that God has called the poor.
-- In @Luke 15 there is someone who is poor, the prodigal son. He had neither food nor lodging. But those who have the character of the house of God welcome such an one, and receive him according to the heart of God.
-- So, Paul, writing to the Corinthians, says that God had not chosen the rich of this world. Proof of the anointing is seen in that one has regard for the poor.
-- In the Psalms, speaking of Christ as the poor Man, it says, "This afflicted one called, and Jehovah heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles" @Psalm 34:6.
{217}
-- "Blessed is he that understandeth the poor" @Psalm 41:1.
-- The twelfth chapter presents all these thoughts, because it is a question of "spiritual manifestations". It is evident that the Corinthians had written to the apostle about this matter, and in answering their questions the apostle develops the subject of the body. At the end of the chapter he introduces the gifts, saying that God has set them in the assembly; it does not say that they are set in the body. Nevertheless, the truth of the body governs the exercise of gift, to the end that we are saved from clericalism. However gifted a brother may be, unless he learns to hold himself as a member of the body, he will act independently and in a clerical spirit.
-- What is the difference between the body and the assembly?
-- The body is an organism which functions so to speak automatically, while the assembly suggests a number of intelligent persons. Each member of the assembly must have answered a call. The word 'assembly' means those who are called out of some place. They must be called. As an example, Members of Parliament might assemble in the House of Parliament at their own will, but they would not form Parliament unless they were convened. In England, it is the King who convenes Parliament, and it cannot function without the Speaker and other Officers. Each member has received a summons and he acts in his place in Parliament according to the functions he possesses. It is supposed that he is intelligent as to the purpose for which he is there. So, "God has set certain in the assembly: first, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers; then miraculous powers; then gifts of healings; helps; governments; kinds of tongues". Consequently, the gifts operate intelligently. The Corinthians were acting in a childish way; they had gifts,
{218}
for it says that they came short in no gift. There were gifts among them, but they were using their gifts to distinguish themselves, and they were acting without regard to the intelligence of the assembly in which they were found, which gave occasion to Satan. A man was seen standing up pretending to speak with spiritual power, when it was only a matter of the power of Satan. The apostle remarks to them at the outset that they had been led away to dumb idols, "in whatever way ye might be *led*", says the apostle. When it is a question of idolatry, it is not a matter merely of idols of wood or stone, but there is a power hidden behind the idol. In their idolatrous practices, men come directly under the power of Satan who acts upon men, and the Corinthians were allowing this principle even among them. It is a terrible thing, that Satan had an entry into the assembly. Then, the apostle gives them a test, a touchstone, to verify whether the man was speaking under the influence of the Spirit of God or under the influence of the spirit of Satan. If he was speaking under the influence of the spirit of Satan, he might even say, "Curse on Jesus". He will never say, 'Lord Jesus', for that influence never recognises the lordship of Jesus. It is by the Spirit that we say "Lord Jesus:" Of course, we may not have these gross excesses in the countries where we live, but, in these verses, we are warned against the danger of speaking so as to exalt ourselves.
-- Someone might have the desire to be "chief" among us, as there were "chiefs" of Edom. Edom had its "chiefs" and its "kings" before Israel, for the natural man always has before him to be first.
-- God, in introducing a King, has in view to meet such movements.
-- He had in view a King after His own heart, a King who would abide. In the Old Testament scriptures, we see that Edom becomes the subject of
{219}
the severest judgments, and it is to Israel that the execution of the final judgment on Edom is reserved. Let us glance at Isaiah 63: "Who is this that cometh from Edom, with deep-red garments from Bozrah, this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? -- I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save. -- Wherefore is redness in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the wine-vat? I have trodden the winepress alone, and of the peoples not a man was with me; and I have trodden them in mine anger, and trampled them in my fury, and their blood is sprinkled upon my garments, and I have stained all mine apparel. For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my redeemed had come. And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: and mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me. And I have trodden down the peoples in mine anger, and made them drunk in my fury; and their blood have I brought down to the earth" @Isaiah 63:1 - 6. The day of vengeance was in His heart, and the year of His redeemed had come. It was the King of Israel who punished Edom. Here we are warned not to exercise a gift in order to distinguish ourselves and be known among the saints in that way.
-- "As unknown, and well known; as dying, and behold we live; as disciplined, and not put to death; as grieved, but always rejoicing; as poor, but enriching many; as having nothing, and possessing all things" @2 Corinthians 6:9,10. It is in that spirit that we should be found, is it not?
-- In the book of Ecclesiastes, the poor wise man delivered the city by his wisdom, in the face of those who had much pretension -- like the "chiefs" and "kings" of Edom. Whence does deliverance come, if not from this spirit of poverty?
-- The saints will not be edified by a spirit of
{220}
pretension. It is in the spirit of humility and poverty that the Spirit develops the testimony, as the Lord said, "*I* am in the midst of you as the one that serves" @Luke 22:27. "But let the greater among you be as the younger, and the leader as he that serves" @Luke 22:26. Having spoken of these necessary tests, the apostle traces the outline of the divine operations: and they are divided into three: there is that which depends on the Spirit, and that which depends on the Lord, and that which depends on God.
-- You are speaking of verses 4, 5 and 6, are you not? "But there are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are distinctions of services, and the same Lord; and there are distinctions of operations, but the same God who operates all things in all".
-- We see then how great are the thoughts which are before us, since the three Persons of the Godhead are working; and They are working on the principle of an infinite unity. It says that there are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit. There are distinctions in these gifts, but all tend to unity. There are distinctions of services, but all the services depend on the same Lord. If we have a gift, we are at the same time servants. The Holy Spirit leads us in the exercise of our gifts: there is therefore spiritual power. But then the Lord intervenes; His authority has to be recognised in it, for these gifts are developed in services. Then, there are distinctions of operations. The operations lead to these results. All these operations depend on God. One plants; another waters, but God gives the increase; it is God who operates all things in all. Everything harmonises in the great field of divine operations, so that there may be a great result according to God. One service may be linked with another, but it leads to a great end according to God who "operates all things in all". There is no doubt that in the creation of the physical
{221}
world, various influences may have been employed, but the great result is one and the same thing. When we consider the immensity of the bodies that exist in the universe and the immense extent of their influence, we see how necessary it is that all should depend on God, because the influences act and react, but the result is one whole. It is the same in the moral system where those who compose it are characterised by individual influence, how necessary it is that we should be subject and dependent on God, in order that our services may all tend to one great end; that is to say that the little part that I provide belongs to the great system of operations, and my desire is that my part should be in keeping with the whole.
-- So Paul uses the illustration of building, because it is a question of the hewn stone which has its place beside another.
-- Does love reign behind all these operations?
-- I think that is what comes out in chapter 13 -- "a way of more surpassing excellence". Chapter 12 gives us light as to the organism. Chapter 13 is the power for movement in us. In chapter 14, there is the functioning, and what is essential is intelligence.
-- "To each the manifestation of the Spirit is given for profit".
-- Then we have this list which includes the word of wisdom, the word of knowledge, faith, gifts of healing, operations of miracles, prophecy, discerning of spirits, kinds of tongues, interpretation of tongues.
-- Do we see miracles in our day?
-- The power is here in the Spirit, but miracles are not necessary.
-- Mr. T. has said that these particular gifts (such as the operations of miracles) are like the church bells to call the congregation, and when it is gathered, the bells are no longer needed.
{222}
-- If a Christian went into heathen countries now, would it not be the time of miracles for him?
-- I have heard of it, but they are not necessary in the assembly.
-- The gifts of miracles were rather to draw people together. In the assembly, it is a question of edification.
-- We see in chapter 14 that the gift of tongues was rather a sign for those who did not believe.
-- What is the greatest gift to be desired?
-- Prophecy. At the beginning of chapter 14 it says, "Be emulous of spiritual manifestations, but rather that ye may prophesy" @1 Corinthians 14:1.
-- The prophet is the one who can present the mind of God.
-- That is what we all need!
-- What are we to understand by "every woman ... prophesying" @1 Corinthians 11:5?
-- The woman might communicate the mind of God. It says that Philip had four daughters who prophesied. It does not say that they were prophetesses, but merely that they prophesied. "This man had four virgin daughters who prophesied" @Acts 21:9. They were not on the list of prophets, but they prophesied: they communicated the mind of God. I believe that the prophets who were formally recognised were men; however, it says that these four daughters prophesied, and if the mind of God is communicated in that way, it must be accepted.
-- They cannot prophesy in assembly.
-- Women are to be silent in the assembly.
-- Then in what sense can they prophesy?
-- In the passage where the daughters of Philip are spoken of, they would have prophesied individually of events to come; it does not mention what they said, nor even that they said anything to Paul. Agabus was there -- "a prophet named Agabus" (@Acts 21:10) and it was he who told what would happen to Paul.
{223}
It seemed to be a characteristic feature of Philip's house; it was his own house. He himself was an evangelist. Where evangelical power and its results are found, it is most necessary that there should be prophecy, because the mind of God must be brought in when you have a certain number of converted persons.
-- Immediately after redemption -- the Red Sea -- you have at Horeb the thoughts of God as to the tabernacle; they are necessary to a redeemed people.
-- In the list that is given here, we have first apostles, and then prophets.
-- The fact that the woman is commanded to keep silence in our assemblies might result in a lack of exercise; the sisters might lose the sense of exercise. But Scripture provides sisters with a great sphere, even for prophesying. You see how Priscilla, in her faith with her husband, was able to be useful, *in her right place*, to a great preacher like Apollos. If she takes her place in subjection, a woman may be used by God in a wonderful way. We have, in Anna, the formal title of prophetess, but she belonged to the old economy. It was the same with Miriam, and with Deborah. It is wonderful to see how Scripture holds us, so to speak, in balance; and the divine intention is that things with us should be in faith, in a living way, so that each sister may be available to the Holy Spirit. "All these things operates the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each in particular according as he pleases".
-- You think that this results from the fact that "we ... have all been given to drink of one Spirit".
-- That is what is said immediately after, Mr. F. "For even as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ. For also in the power of one Spirit *we* have all been baptised into one body,
{224}
whether Jews or Greeks, whether bondmen or free, and have all been given to drink of one Spirit".
-- "So also is the Christ". There is the secret of all that!
-- And then, "in the power of one Spirit we have all been baptised ... and have all been given to drink of one Spirit".
-- Is the one for our deliverance and the other for our enjoyment?
-- Baptism with water separates us from the world positionally; but the baptism of the Spirit separates us from the world in power. Baptism is the act of another, and it is to the end that we should all be merged or absorbed into one body. It is the Lord who baptises us; but in order to show that we enter into the thing that we enjoy ourselves, it says, "We ... have all been given to drink".
-- The fact of drinking expresses satisfaction.
-- It is the Lord who baptises us, but when can we say that we enter into it?
-- We enter into it when we receive the Spirit, and we see how we can enjoy it together as brethren. It is remarkable that our physical bodies are so constituted that there is much enjoyment incidental to the functions of the body. How much pleasure is procured to us by seeing, by hearing, by smell, by taste! God, in His great goodness, has made things in this way as compensation in nature. God would have us understand that in creating He was not hard or severe; He was good, and everything continues, in the physical creation, with a certain sense of enjoyment. No doubt, sin has spoilt everything; but at the outset the idea was such; and when we apply the principle to what God has shown in redemption, we see how the thing is developed. "We ... have all been given to drink of one Spirit"; having part in the thing, we enjoy it.
{225}
-- The same principle that governs the unity in the Godhead is going to be witnessed in the body.
-- "God is love" (@1 John 4:8), and love is at the foundation of everything. The apostle presents the figure of the body to show, in the first place, that no member ought to isolate himself. The foot cannot say that it does not belong to the body because it is not a hand. And then, one member cannot say to another, 'I have no need of thee'. Of these two cases, the first applies to each one of us; a brother could not isolate himself and say, I do not belong to the body. In the second case, I might say to a brother: I have no need of you.
We have prolonged the meeting a little, but it was for the benefit of many brethren who have come a distance. The thought of this chapter 12 is to preserve us from the spirit of independence which would separate us from the body, and from the clerical spirit that would do without certain ones. It speaks of consideration for those that are weak -- "But much rather, the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary; and those parts of the body which we esteem to be the more void of honour, these we clothe with more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness; but our comely parts have not need". It is a most beautiful feature, that those that are weak and do not appear necessary should be clothed with more abundant honour. Paul applies all that he has just said to the local company at Corinth. "Now *ye* are Christ's body, and members in particular".
-- Was the company at Corinth Christ's body?
-- There, they were characteristically Christ's body. The thought of God is that there should be a vessel in which Christ is expressed. As we said at Valence, the divine idea is that there may be a vessel, in each locality, for testimony and for service. It is set up,
{226}
according to these chapters, in intelligence and dignity.
-- The thought was that there should be here a complete representation of Christ in each locality. Now we cannot hope to have a complete representation in a large town. All that we can do is to take these chapters as light, and to seek to walk in that light, doing it in such a way that the light operates in those who are walking together.
-- Can it be said that in verse 26 there is evidence that we realise our place in the body? "If one member suffer, all the members suffer with it".
-- Quite so. It is easier to suffer with a member than to rejoice with him; and that is humbling.
-- Why, Mr. T.?
-- Because we are lacking in love. If we had more love we should rejoice when God honours a brother. "If one member be glorified, all the members rejoice with it". If God glorifies one of us, God is testing me myself to see if I can rejoice with him.
-- And I cannot rejoice with someone who is morally greater than I, if I have not first rejoiced in Christ.

PREPARATION AND FURNISHING
@Luke 22:7 - 13; @1 Chronicles 15:1 - 4
I have in mind, dear brethren, to speak of preparation and furnishing, in connection with the service of God.
God has made particular use of the evangelist Luke in this regard. He lays emphasis on method, on order and on furnishing. The passage we have read relates the fact that it was the Lord Himself who had the thought of preparation for the passover. In Matthew and Mark, the thought arises with the disciples. It is a true sign of exercise before God, when we are exercised with regard to preparation and furnishing in relation to the service of God. Luke has in mind the vessel of service. So he begins his gospel with the presentation of Zacharias and Elizabeth, who were both of the priestly family. It says of Zacharias that he was serving God according to the order of the priesthood; "he fulfilled his priestly service before God in the order of his course" @Luke 1:8. Then, we have the angel Gabriel, who must have been very well acquainted with divine order in heaven. Without doubt he had had his part in the celebration of praise, when the foundations of the earth were laid. It says that at that time "the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy" @Job 38:7. The "sons of God" spoken of in the book of Job, are angels. So, in carrying out his service, Gabriel would have had in mind that order of things in which God is praised. He appeared to Zacharias in the temple. Then he appeared to Mary. Zacharias and his wife Elizabeth, as well as Mary, unite in a tribute of praise at the beginning of Luke's gospel.
In the second chapter, we have the angelic choir who celebrate the marvellous event which had just taken place; they celebrate the birth of Jesus. An
{228}
angel comes to the shepherds who were keeping watch by night over their flocks, and announces the glorious gospel of that moment. "Behold, I announce to you glad tidings of great joy, which shall be to all the people; for today a Saviour has been born to you in David's city, who is Christ the Lord" @Luke 2:10,11. Then, "Suddenly, there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good pleasure in men" @Luke 2:13,14. Heaven, so to speak, was giving expression to its emotions in accents of praise to God in the highest. There must have been an order, a perfect harmony, in the praise that went up to God. But God's intention was that these praises should ascend to Him from the lips of men, and that there should be upon earth a harmonious choir which should be in accord with the heavenly choir. So, at the end of Luke's gospel, after the Lord had gone up to heaven, we find the disciples continually in the temple, filled with joy, "praising and blessing God" @Luke 24:53.
Simeon in the second chapter begins this song. He comes into the temple, led by the Spirit. He takes the Child Jesus into his arms. He praises God that his eyes have seen the salvation of the Lord. See how this feature of order in regard to the praise of God appears in the gospel of Luke! It is true that at the outset the song was found with "the sons of God" at the creation of the world, but if sonship belongs to men also in that the Son of God had come into manhood, nevertheless the service of God depends, in Luke, on priesthood, because of what we are still as in the flesh, and because of the world in which we are found. Priesthood is to be understood and taken up in order that this service may be maintained. I hope to come back to that later, but I wish to speak of this preparation for the passover. It was the Lord Himself who took the initiative, according to this gospel; and He chose the two
{229}
disciples who had most intelligence and experience to prepare it. The importance of the preparation was such that He chose these two principal apostles. We may therefore learn from that what importance attaches to these external things, and see how necessary order and spiritual furnishing are in the mind of God. We may say that that is in view throughout the epistle to the Corinthians. The apostle refers to commandments, to directions, and to customs, and he makes it clear that he had not mentioned everything in the letter, because he says, "But the other things, whenever I come, I will set in order" @1 Corinthians 11:34. Further, he refers elsewhere to Ephesus, saying that he had left Timotheus there that he might set in order certain things; and in writing to the Colossians, he says that he rejoiced, seeing their order. The details of which the apostle speaks are so minute that he is even occupied with the necessity that a woman should have her head covered; he appeals to nature to teach these principles.
So, the Lord sent Peter and John to prepare: "Go and prepare the passover for us". And it says, "And having gone they found it as he had said to them; and they prepared the passover". We may be assured, dear brethren, that they omitted nothing of what the celebration of the passover for our Lord Himself required. Then we see that the place of the preparation was to be "a large upper room". It was a *large* room, an *upper* room, and it was *furnished*. The largeness of the room suggests the increase that the Lord contemplated. He was indicating beforehand that the apostles were to be prepared for many conversions. These converts were not to remain without a home, and the largeness of their number was not to occasion any uneasiness, any embarrassment. So we find that after Peter's first preaching, on the day of Pentecost, a large number of persons were converted; and the Holy Spirit tells us that
{230}
"there were added in that day about three thousand souls" @Acts 2:41. These persons had heard Peter's words; they had repented, according to his word, and they had been baptised. No doubt, according to the word, they had received the Holy Spirit. A wonderful company of three thousand souls, were they to remain homeless? Were these persons to return to their different religious associations, as some of our modern so-called evangelists advise their hearers? No, beloved. Their entry had been anticipated by the great Shepherd of the flock. The "large" upper room would give us the idea that there was room for them. When the Lord came into this world He was laid in a manger. No suitable place had been prepared to receive Him. But if He has to provide for the needs of His own, He provides for them in a suitable way. I cannot say what will be the number of the redeemed who will enter into heaven, but I can say with confidence that there will be ample room for them. That place will be prepared, and prepared by the Lord Himself. He says, "I go to prepare you a place" (@John 14:2); and what a place, dear brethren! The Lord showed beforehand, as regards those who were converted through the gospel, that there was to be room for them in the upper room. In chapter 14 of this same gospel of Luke, we see, in the parable of the great supper, that after many guests had been brought in, there was still room. "And there is still room" @Luke 14:22. Then the master of the house said, "Go out into the ways and fences and compel to come in, *that my house may be filled*" @Luke 14:23. So, beloved, provision was made for those three thousand converts on the day of Pentecost. They were not to go hither or thither to seek a spiritual refuge. During the Lord's life down here, the disciples had been accustomed to provide for the needs of many persons. When it was a question of feeding five thousand persons, the disciples would have sent them here and
{231}
there into the villages, but the Lord said to them, "Give *ye* them to eat" @Mark 6:37. Then they had to be made to sit down in ranks by hundreds and by fifties; they were to eat in comfort and in happy communion with one another. Thus the apostles had had all this education and experience. Peter and John therefore ought to have understood. We find that these three thousand were *added*. The first time it is spoken of, it does not say that the Lord added them; it simply says, "There were added in that day about three thousand souls" @Acts 2:41. That is to say, they were added to those who were already there. They were at least a hundred and twenty already. They were abiding, according to what is told us, in the upper room -- "the upper chamber"; it was upon these that the Holy Spirit descended; and it was to these that three thousand souls were added in one day. We may be sure that the hundred and twenty had not taken the place that the newcomers were going to occupy. They were in "the upper chamber", and they had not reserved the best of anything for themselves. The others were added, and became a part of the whole. The three thousand were to be welcomed among the hundred and twenty and share in the conditions in which these already were. Thus, we find a description of the whole company at Jerusalem, and that description includes the hundred and twenty and the three thousand. We are told that "they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers" @Acts 2:42. They had been baptised in the power of one Spirit *into one body*, and on their part, they persevered. They formed one whole. No one said that anything of what he possessed was his own, but all things were common to them. You can therefore see, beloved, that the element of preparation was in the company. So, as the company increased, the preparation, the room and the furnishing increased as well. It also
{232}
says that every day they were constantly in the temple with one accord, and breaking bread in the house, they received their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, praising God and having favour with all the people. The breaking of bread in those days, was a concentration of affections and intercourse. We cannot say how many houses were used for this purpose; seeing that the Holy Spirit mentions the fact, it is certain that it occupied a great place. The preparation, the suitable place, and the furnishing contributed to what was to give pleasure to God. There was not the least evidence of uneasiness, for the element of provision was among them. Since the furnishing was there, they were free to praise God.
The question arises, Is this element of preparation and furnishing found among us? If God places within our reach those whom He wishes to bless and encourage, do we give them to understand that there is abundant room for them, for the development of their thoughts and of their affections? Why should a true believer in Christ not be publicly in this sphere, so as to take part in this happy community where the love of God and the love of Christ are the portion of all our hearts?
It should be evident that, however large may be the number of those whom God exercises, there is room enough for them. One is conscious of one's own weakness in that respect. How little sense we have of the elevation and largeness of the chamber, and of the furnishing which is suitable! There is abundant room for all the children of God; each one of them may there find room for the development of his mind, of his spiritual thoughts, of his affections. All who belong to the "house of Israel" and to the "house of Aaron" should have part in it.
I refer for a moment to the first book of Chronicles, where we have the same thought of preparation.
{233}
David had been reminded of the divine claims in a very serious manner, when he placed the ark of God upon a cart; in the thirteenth chapter it says that "they carried the ark of God on a new cart" (@1 Chronicles 13:7); then it says that "the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he had put forth his hand to the ark" @1 Chronicles 13:10. The oxen had stumbled, and he had put forth his hand to hold the ark. It was a, solemn warning to David, that God took great account of the furnishing. And we find, in chapter 15, that David "*prepared* a place for the ark of God, and *spread* a tent for it". Then he said, "None *ought* to carry the ark of God but the Levites, for them has Jehovah chosen to carry the ark of God, and to serve him for ever". We see that David had profited by the severe discipline occasioned by the death of Uzza. This is for us, dear brethren, that we may not neglect the divine principles and divine customs that ought to characterise us in the service of God. So it says that "David assembled all Israel to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Jehovah to its place that he had prepared for it. And David gathered the sons of Aaron and the Levites". We see how David had understood what Jehovah had done to Uzza, and how he had profited by it. He sees that the ark can only be carried by the Levites. From this point of view the Levites are in effect priests. So in our days, God would assemble the sons of Aaron and the Levites. The ministry of John introduces the family; but the ministry of Paul, supported by Luke, introduces the priestly order. As possessing the Spirit, we must know that we have to do with the service of God; and the apostle says, "If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is the Lord's commandment" @1 Corinthians 14:37. There is therefore an appeal to the saints; we are to have part in the service of God, and the
{234}
service is to be according to the established order, the due order.
Now, before I stop, I would ask you to read @Psalm 115:9 - 15. "*O Israel, confide thou in Jehovah*: he is their help and their shield". If the priests are conscious of having need of furnishing, the word is: "O Israel, confide thou in Jehovah". "Israel" refers to the saints as having the Spirit.
Then we have the house of Aaron. "*House of Aaron, confide in Jehovah*: he is their help and their shield". As having the Holy Spirit, if I call upon God, He helps me: "Ask and ye shall receive" @John 16:24. But then, viewing me as a priest, I confide in Jehovah, who is "their help and their shield". I ask Him, and He gives me what I need.
"*Ye that fear Jehovah, confide in Jehovah*: he is their help and their shield. Jehovah hath been mindful of us: he will bless, he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron; He will bless them that fear Jehovah, both the small and the great". All the resources of God are at our disposal, in relation to His service. "Prove me ...", He says later, "if I open not to you the windows of the heavens, and pour you out a blessing, till there be no place for it" @Malachi 3:10. According to verse 14, we can expect increase: "Jehovah will add unto you more, unto you and unto your children. Ye are blessed of Jehovah, who made the heavens and the earth".
Let us read again @Psalm 135:19 - 21. "House of Israel, bless ye Jehovah; house of Aaron, bless ye Jehovah; house of Levi, bless ye Jehovah; ye that fear Jehovah, bless Jehovah. Blessed be Jehovah out of Zion, who dwelleth at Jerusalem! Hallelujah!" We see how the service of God reaches its climax, according to these thoughts, by way of the furnishing, and those who have part in this service appeal to those who should have part in it; they engage them to join with them.
{235}
After having suffered the discipline of God, David introduces the service by the priests and the Levites. The first book of Chronicles therefore shows us the wonderful result for God, the result seen in David who learnt what was suitable to God for His service. It is as introducing this service that he is called the "man of God".
May God bless these thoughts to our hearts!
Address by J.T. at Bronac (Haute-Loire), 15th May, 1926, afternoon.
{236}
THOSE WHO ARE ADDED
@Acts 2:41 - 47; @Acts 3:1 - 11
The four gospels give us the account of the way in which the Lord Jesus did His service down here; the book of the Acts describes how the apostles fulfilled theirs, bringing out the results produced. The converts were added to what already existed. That which existed was the fruit of the ministry of Christ. Now, a company is seen of men and women who have received blessing through our Lord Jesus Christ and who love Him; they are seen together in an upper room at Jerusalem. On the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit came and sat upon each of them. They were therefore affected by the presence of the Holy Spirit in such wise that several who saw them said, "They are full of new wine" (@Acts 2:13); but they were not drunk with wine, as was supposed. So Peter, whom the Lord had formed to preach, stands up with the eleven apostles and explains to the Jews that they were not drunken, but that the Holy Spirit had come down from Christ, out of heaven. He says, "Having therefore been exalted by the right hand of God, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which *ye* behold and hear" @Acts 2:33. He says further on, "Let the whole house of Israel therefore know assuredly that God has made him, this Jesus whom *ye* have crucified, both Lord and Christ" @Acts 2:36. In other words, Peter explains in his discourse the marvellous fact that the Holy Spirit had come down out of heaven, from Christ, and that the Holy Spirit was dwelling in persons who were actually at Jerusalem. Those who heard these words were pricked in heart, and said to the apostles, "What shall we do, brethren?" @Acts 2:37. Peter answered them, "Repent, and be baptised, each one of you,
{237}
in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" @Acts 2:38. That is the point that things reached on that great day, the day of Pentecost! There was a company who loved Christ; each one of them had received the Spirit of Christ, from heaven. Then, there was a preacher, for God, in setting forth His testimony, qualifies men to preach. The Lord had taken Peter, with certain others, on to a mountain, and had appointed twelve of them to be with Him, and to send them to preach. Now, we see one of them preaching, and the effect of his preaching is such that those who hear him are pricked in heart, and say to Peter and the others, "What shall we do, brethren?". Such was the result of his preaching. These men were guilty, as inhabitants of Jerusalem, of the death of the Lord Jesus. The Lord had been to Jerusalem; He had done miracles there; He had taught in the temple, and He was crucified by those who were at Jerusalem, as it is said later on, "where also their Lord was crucified" @Revelation 11:8. It was indeed rightly that they said, "What shall we do, brethren?" being convicted, for the preaching is in view of bringing about conviction.
We who are of the nations were not so directly guilty of the death of Christ. Nevertheless, the testimony of God is that all have sinned and come short of the glory of God. The preaching of the gospel to the nations has also brought about repentance, as it says, "God therefore, having overlooked the times of ignorance, now enjoins men that they shall all everywhere repent" @Acts 17:30. As being repentant, we desire to know what we must do. "What shall we do?" "He has set a day in which he is going to judge the habitable earth in righteousness by the man whom he has appointed, giving the proof of it to all in having raised him from among the dead" @Acts 17:31. According to the measure in which the light penetrates into our souls, we see that we have to do with that Man, for God has
{238}
ordained that He shall execute judgment because He is the Son of man. Then, we desire to know what we must do. "What shall we do?" Peter's answer to the Jews at Jerusalem is the answer for us at this moment. "Repent, and be baptised, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" @Acts 2:38. A man of the nations, having been convicted, said to Paul and Silas, "What must I do that I may be saved?" @Acts 16:30. The answer was, "Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house" @Acts 16:31. What I have said, dear friends, includes in few words, the foundations of the gospel, "that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures; and that he was buried; and that he was raised the third day, according to the scriptures" (@1 Corinthians 15:3,4); it was necessary "that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations beginning at Jerusalem" @Luke 24:47. Those who repent and believe in His name receive the forgiveness of sins and the gift of the Holy Spirit.
All that I have said is by way of introduction to what I have particularly before me, for I have no doubt that all who are present know these facts well. I may even say that I believe that all those who are in this hall are believers.
So I would like to speak of the way in which believers are received, and how they walked and lived after having been received into the bosom of the assembly. What I have in mind is connected with the word 'add'. There is another in chapter 9 which is very much like it; it is the word 'grow' or 'multiply'. I will perhaps speak of it later on, but I would like first to speak of the word 'add'. I wish to show you in the first place those who were added. It may be that there are some here who have not been added, although they have repented. It may be that they know forgiveness, that they have been baptised, that they have the Spirit of God.
{239}
In spite of that, they are not added in the sense used in this passage. It says in verse 41 of chapter 2, "Those then who had accepted his word were baptised". They were subject to what Peter had indicated and required. He had told them to repent and be baptised; that was an individual thing -- "be baptised, *each one* of you". Then it says, "Those then who had accepted his word were baptised". If I receive the testimony of God into my soul, I act according to His requirements; if it is necessary that I should be baptised, I am baptised. When Philip preached to the eunuch, later on, it says, "They came upon a certain water, and the eunuch says, Behold water; what hinders my being baptised?" @Acts 8:36. He is subject to the demands of the testimony, "And they went down both to the water" @Acts 8:38. If the testimony requires that I should be baptised, I submit to baptism; and no one can be considered as being publicly added before being baptised. Then, there is another thing that the Lord requires of the believer; this is also a public thing: it is that the believer *as baptised* should partake of the Lord's supper. I am not acting according to the requirements of the testimony, unless I partake of the Lord's supper; and in that case, I cannot be considered as added publicly to the people of God. You see that it says that those who were added "persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers". They had received Peter's word which was the word of God for that moment. They were baptised, and it says that "there were added in that day about three thousand souls". These converted persons did not stop half-way. They did not wait a week, or a month, or a year, before ranging themselves publicly on the side of the testimony. They were "added" *in that day*. Why should they not have been added "in that day"? They had repented; they had been forgiven; they
{240}
had been baptised; they had received the Spirit. Why should they not be identified publicly with the saints? "There were added in that day about three thousand souls". They would not be sitting on the back seats when the saints were partaking of the Supper. They would be able to partake of the Supper, as well as Peter, for the Supper is for all those who love the Lord Jesus Christ. So it is in verse 42 that "they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers". It is a question of what they themselves did. They could not baptise themselves; another had to baptise them. But, on the other hand, no one can break bread for me: that action is therefore presented as being their personal action; and they persevered in all those things. Is there a Christian here who does not do them? Then, I will say to him, You are not acting according to the word of God; up to a certain point you are governed by your own thoughts; you are not wholly following the Lord Jesus Christ. You are not identified with the Lord Jesus in His rejection, and you are not in the fellowship of the saints. So the Holy Spirit tells us with joy that all these persons persevered in the doctrine and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers.
It also says that "all that believed were together". It was a wonderful company; they loved one another and resorted frequently to one another's company. Their baptism had separated them from the world, and the breaking of bread had brought them into the fellowship of the apostles. They were there happily, and there was no lack among them. It says that they sold their possessions and substance, and distributed them to all, according as anyone might have need. Such was the practical unity that characterised them! No one considered his substance as belonging to himself alone, but as belonging to all. Then, it says, "And every day, being constantly in
{241}
the temple with one accord, and breaking bread in the house, they received their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, praising God, and having favour with all the people". You see, dear brethren, what there was in that company. They praised God. According to this passage, there was not a single one among those three thousand who was sitting outside. They broke bread in their houses. When the bread and the cup passed before them there was some for all, and all partook of it. Why not partake of it? We see therefore the force and bearing of the word 'add' used in verse 41 -- they were truly added. In the last verse of the second chapter, "The Lord added to the assembly daily those that were to be saved". Each one having been added became a part of the company. They participated in all its privileges and in all its responsibilities. That is what the Lord had on earth, and He Himself added to it those who were to be saved.
Now, as to what I have to say regarding chapter 3, my exercise is rather for those who are already in the company. The question is this, Can we attract souls? As possessing these great privileges, we ought to possess that which is attractive to souls. "Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, which is the ninth hour". These two apostles represented, so to speak, the best that God had upon earth. The Thessalonians were only young believers when the apostle Paul wrote to them; he says of them, "Ye became models to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia" (@1 Thessalonians 1:7): and the testimony had sounded out from them. I refer to the Thessalonians to show that, although there may be no Peters and Johns, those of us who are in fellowship ought at least to be attractive to others. So, Peter and John say to this man who was at the Beautiful gate of the temple, "Look on us". That word is for our hearts, and I hope it will touch the hearts of all who are in
{242}
this hall. If I tell an exercised soul to look on me, I must be prepared for my life to be scrutinised, as well as my ways and my circumstances. Is my life in conformity with the word of God? But I also apply that to a company such as this. If this company says to an exercised soul, "Look on us", what does he see? It is an invitation to scrutinise us, for which I ought to be prepared myself. Do my walk and ways conform to the word of God? Are we together in the enjoyment of Christian privileges? Do we appreciate them? Here are two brothers going up to the temple at the hour of prayer. Do we meet together at the hour of prayer? Is there *an hour* of prayer? At Philippi, there was a place where it was customary to gather for prayer; those who had burdens met together to pray. They were together before God in prayer. With regard to all the other features that should characterise the assembly, are we directed by the word of God? Do we forsake the assembling of ourselves together, or do we testify that we appreciate the fellowship? We are together as often as possible, are we not? These things are so practical!
If we are not attractive to young converts, how will they be attracted? It is true that they should be attracted to the Lord; but Peter and John do not say, Look on the Lord. They say that it is in the name of the Lord Jesus that this lame man will be healed; but they also say, "Look on us". There was something spiritually attractive in Peter and John. There was more than that, dear brethren. Peter says to the man, "Silver and gold I have not; but what I have, this give I to thee: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazaraean rise up and walk". Peter speaks of the Lord as being the only One able to help whomsoever it may be. But there is still something else, and I wish you to take note of it. He held out to the man his right hand, or rather,
{243}
as it says, he took hold of him by the right hand: "And having taken hold of him by the right hand he raised him up". Are we accustomed to act thus? It is not only a question of giving light. The preaching of the gospel is what gives light. But there is also "the right hand". Each of the young persons present has a right hand. Have I taken their right hand? It is true that one can do nothing without the power of the Lord Jesus Christ, but every believer in the Lord Jesus Christ has power, and the essential thing is to take the right hand of the one whom we desire to see saved, whom we wish to see baptised, whom we would like to see in fellowship. You make him feel that, as a believer, he possesses a link with you. We see further on that it speaks of the right hand of fellowship given to Paul. Here, Peter takes the right hand of this lame man. I think that refers to what there was in the man; he must have more power in his right hand than in his left. He had no power to walk, but he had some power in his right hand. If I am concerned with some converted person, I know that he possesses some power, and he ought to be attached to the company according to the power that he has. I am perfectly sure that if we proceed in this way, many will be added. "Having taken hold of him by the right hand he raised him up". You see how that is done. You say the Lord will do it; but He will not do what *you* ought to do. That is how I ought to regard the thing. Peter did not leave the care of it to the Lord; he took him by the hand; and not only did he take him, but he lifted him up. That is to say there was a measure of power in that man; and there was power in Peter. He took him; he lifted him up; and then God operated. It says, "Immediately his feet and ankle bones were made strong". That was the operation of God. We can be assured that if we take young Christians by the right hand, God will work immediately.
{244}
"Immediately his feet and ankle bones were made strong. And leaping up he stood and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God". That man was forty years of age. He is immediately linked with Peter and John. He enters immediately with them into the temple; that is to say he is publicly identified with the saints. He walked, and leaped, and praised God. There was a perfect response to the testimony of God presented to men. Further on it says that he held Peter and John by the hand. "And as he held Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the portico which is called Solomon's, greatly wondering". Peter had taken him by the right hand, and now he has seized the idea: he takes them by the hand. He uses his right hand to hold Peter and John.
I would also like to say a few words with regard to growth. It says in chapter 9 that the assemblies of Judaea were edified. "The assemblies then throughout the whole of Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified and walking in the fear of the Lord, and were increased through the comfort of the Holy Spirit" @Acts 9:31. *They* grew; they were increased in a spiritual way; there was growth with the saints. But it is evident that they increased in number. The growth in chapter 9 is the result of the state of the assembly. In the second chapter, they were added through the preaching, but there is the thought that the saints themselves multiplied. From the outset, from the presence of man on the earth, there was the idea of multiplication. God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it" @Genesis 1:28. Thus, in chapter 9, the saints were in peace; they were edified; they walked in the fear of the Lord; they increased through the comfort of the Holy Spirit. That is the result, dear brethren, of a good spiritual state in the meeting. It is not here a question of preaching; it is rather
{245}
the normal growth, when a healthy and vigorous condition exists in the meeting. That is what comes from *within* -- growth. Souls are added *from without*. I would very much like that distinction to be clear. I believe the thought is expressed in Psalm 113: "He maketh the barren woman to keep house, as a joyful mother of sons" @Psalm 113:9. Additions come from without, but sons are produced by a healthy and vigorous condition among the saints: that is increase. Our children according to flesh grow normally when they come into the assembly, and when there is the comfort of the Holy Spirit, we can expect this normal growth, proceeding from the inside. But there is also the fact that God adds from without. These are two actions which should not be interrupted.
What I desired was in particular to draw attention to the action of Peter, in taking the man by the right hand and lifting him up. And God immediately adds such a soul.

THE ANOINTED VESSEL (8)
@1 Corinthians 14
-- In our last reading we read chapter 12. We saw how the epistle brings us up to the thought of the anointed vessel, that is to say the saints of a locality viewed in a collective way. The figure of the human body is used to bring out our dependence upon one another, in order that we may be preserved from clericalism on the one hand, and independence on the other. God had indicated, in the distribution of the gifts, that although there is variety, there was unity. Chapter 12, verse 28 gives us, so to say, a résumé of all the gifts. It says, "And God has set certain in the assembly: first, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers; then miraculous powers; then gifts of healings; helps; governments; kinds of tongues" @1 Corinthians 12:28. Such is the order in which they are given; it is the order of their importance, the last mentioned being that of tongues.
-- Would that be the least important?
-- It seems so.
-- The first three remain to the end, spiritually, not officially.
-- The epistle to the Ephesians gives us the list of the gifts which are to remain down here as being spiritual gifts: apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers. These are the spiritual gifts under four characters: shepherds and teachers go together as one gift. Evangelists are omitted in the epistle to the Corinthians.
-- What would be the difference between the epistle to the Ephesians and that to the Corinthians in that regard?
-- It says in verse 4 of chapter 12, "But there are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit" @1 Corinthians 12:4. Strictly
{247}
speaking, in the epistle to the Corinthians, it is God who has placed the gifts in the assembly; @1 Corinthians 12:28.
-- And in verse 11? "All these things operates the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each in particular according as he pleases" @1 Corinthians 12:11.
-- Here it is not a question of the gifts, but of the members, of Christians individually. Generally in Corinthians, all comes from God. The order in which God has been pleased to give the gifts is remarkable. So, you have "first", then "secondly", then "thirdly", and so on. Divine order is a characteristic feature of the epistle to the Corinthians. In that way, there is room in the assembly for that which is superlative, that which is very excellent. What is specially of God, as being better than the rest, is to be recognised. For example, we have in chapter 11 the order in creation: God, Christ, man, woman. There is no doubt that what corresponds to that order is seen also with the angels; even Satan's rank is recognised: it says that "Michael the archangel, when disputing with the devil he reasoned about the body of Moses, did not dare to bring a railing judgment against him, but said, The Lord rebuke thee" @Jude 1:9. It is important not to lose sight of that in the assembly, because that is what will keep us from a clerical spirit. On the other hand, he that is greatest among us is to be the least. A right balance is preserved in the assembly. We must, however, recognise what comes "first", "secondly ... .. thirdly", etc. We have therefore to recognise what God has placed among us. If there are those who have moral power by virtue of their experience with God, who have prominent gifts, they must be recognised. One who neglects divine order so manifested, ignores not man but God.
-- In the gospel of Luke, when the Lord chose the apostles, they are named in order.
-- Yes. That is an important remark, for it was not only a matter of the sovereign choice of the Lord.
{248}
In choosing Paul, God did not wish the apostles to be set aside. That is what the Corinthians were seeking to do, and the apostle is obliged to bring forward his moral qualities. He was ashamed to do it, but he was compelled to, in order to withstand the effort of the enemy.
-- He said it was folly to speak of them.
-- So in the second epistle to Timothy he says, "That through me the proclamation might be fully made" @2 Timothy 4:17. The twelfth chapter has in view gifts or spiritual manifestations; their importance is fully recognised and the best are to be desired. But, before comparing them and bringing out how to exercise them in the assembly, the apostle says, "Yet shew I unto you a way of more surpassing excellence" @1 Corinthians 12:31. Before touching upon the subject of the exercise of gifts in the assembly, he desires that we should reflect on the way of love. The effect produced by love, with a believer, is to lead him to take the last place among the saints, and while possessing the most brilliant gifts, if I have not love, I am personally nothing. The apostle contemplates the possibility of speaking with the tongues of men and of angels, or of having prophecy, or of knowing all mysteries, or even having all faith, so as to remove mountains; but if I "have not love, I am nothing" @1 Corinthians 13:2.
-- What is to be understood by the tongue of angels?
-- The angels must have a great power of expression. We have a few hints with regard to the angels, but there are only a few things revealed to us. The Colossians were warned not to be occupied with what related to angels, inquiring into those things that they had not seen. This allusion in chapter 13 suggests that they had great power to express themselves. That which he says here about love covers a large extent and indicates a sphere in which it operates.
{249}
It is characterised by long patience, by kindness; it is not emulous of others; it is not insolent and rash, nor is it puffed up; it does not behave in an unseemly way, nor seek what is its own; it is not quickly provoked; it does not impute evil; it does not rejoice at iniquity but rejoices with the truth; it bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. "Love never fails" @1 Corinthians 13:8. That is what covers the believer in all his relations. There are things that we could not regard as criminal which, however, are not of the nature of love.
-- Love is the life of God manifested down here; it adapts itself to all the exigencies of the present scene.
-- If we wish to express it, we must study love in Christ.
-- Do you think the tongue of angels might be seductive? Those who transform themselves into angels of light have much eloquence, but nothing of God.
-- Can it be discerned if a gift is truly exercised in love?
-- If we know love, we discern where it is, everywhere. If a man exercises his gift in order to make himself prominent, that is not love. That becomes a test. The apostle would have been able to test everything at Corinth. Love would be seen with a person who was fully developed spiritually. He says, "When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child, I reasoned as a child" @1 Corinthians 13:11. That appears to allude to what they were themselves. He says, "When I became a man, I had done with what belonged to the child" @1 Corinthians 13:11. To act as a child would include the thought of acting for one's own aggrandisement among the saints.
-- Would there not be the touchstone in chapter 13 edification?
-- If there is love, there is edification.
{250}
-- "Follow after love", he says. Love is, so to speak, on the throne among us; and the apostle presents it in its abstract perfection. Love becomes then a touchstone among the saints, to test all that is said and all that is done; and it is the essence of all life and all enjoyment for time and eternity. It must be observed that it is the only thing that abides.
-- Do you not think that one who does not serve in love must go, sooner or later? He does not abide.
-- But love abides.
-- We have the thought of the bondman who loves his master; he does not wish to leave him. "I love my master, my wife, and my children" @Exodus 21:5.
-- It is thus that the Lord has shown the excellent way.
-- What are we to understand by speaking, praying and singing with the spirit and with the understanding? What is the difference between acting "with the spirit" and acting "with the understanding"?
-- The word 'spirit' does not refer to the Holy Spirit. It is my own spirit. Your spirit is that which puts you in direct relation with God. It is by means of your spirit that you express your emotions, for in the presence of God I should be able to have emotions towards Him. By virtue of that emotion I shall desire to speak to Him in an intelligible manner in the assembly. I must therefore take account of my understanding to see if what my emotions suggest to me is in accord with what is taking place in the assembly at that moment. If my understanding teaches me that it would be better not to speak, I am silent till the moment comes.
-- The spirit would be rather in relation to God, and the understanding to edification, to the saints.
-- It is necessary to weigh what would be for edification and what would be orderly. Spiritual understanding is therefore the principal feature in this chapter. In the house of God, one ought not to
{251}
speak at random and without reason. In a lunatic asylum, everyone speaks without regard to what others are thinking, saying or doing. It says in verse 23, "If therefore the whole assembly come together in one place, and all speak with tongues, and simple persons enter in, or unbelievers, will not they say ye are mad?" As we see further on, the prophets are to prophesy one by one, but "let two or three prophets speak". Then, if "some unbeliever or simple person come in, he is convicted of all, he is judged of all; the secrets of his heart are manifested; and thus, falling upon his face, he will do homage to God, reporting that God is indeed amongst you".
-- If God is there, He will be seen.
-- The interior of the tabernacle was overlaid with gold; all was to speak of God.
-- In the assembly of God, what is essential is that He is there, seen in the power and order in which things are done.
-- There must not be confusion.
-- In the light of this chapter, we come together in one place "in assembly". We have our spiritual emotions, for we are in spirit in relation with God; but one must not give expression to all one's spiritual impressions at once. If you wish to give out a hymn, you will give it out according to your spiritual emotions, and you will give it out having regard to what is taking place. You will sing with the spirit, but also with the understanding.
-- When the Lord addressed the Father at the end of Matthew 11, it says, "At that time" @Matthew 11:25. You have the Lord's holy emotions towards the Father, but it says, "At that time". The Lord is the Model. His emotions towards the Father were governed by the suitable moment.
-- It says that after the Supper, they sang a hymn. There was perfect order.
{252}
-- In verse 23, then, order and understanding are lacking; but in verse 24, they are there.
-- Is it the Spirit of God who suggests spiritual emotions to our spirit?
-- Not necessarily. The assembly is composed of intelligent persons. The thought of God is to have sons before Him, although that is not the subject in the epistle to the Corinthians. What is done is done by persons who have been made free and intelligent in His presence. In @Romans 8, we have received the Spirit of adoption whereby we cry, "Abba, Father" @Romans 8:15. The person who speaks, and whom God hears, is a son. Romans 8 shows that it is by the Spirit that we speak to God. It is we who do it; that is why our spirit enters into it. In that eighth chapter of Romans, "The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God" @Romans 8:16.
-- In her song, Mary says, "My spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour" @Luke 1:47.
-- When does this chapter have its application among us?
-- I believe it is a continuation of chapter 11. It says, "If therefore the *whole* assembly come together in one place", that is to say, If *all* the brethren in a locality come together into one place. That would be in continuation of verse 20 of chapter 11: "When ye come therefore together into one place" (@1 Corinthians 11:20), chapter 11 having in view the Lord's supper, and contemplating the saints as together. I believe that governs the whole of this chapter. What we have in chapter 14 may take place during the week.
-- It may well be that in chapter 14 we have not the Supper.
-- It would be rather a question of ministry for edification. I believe chapter 14 governs all the part one takes in the assembly, which would even cover chapter 11. So you have in verse 26, "Whenever ye come together". The expression "in assembly"
{253}
is omitted. "Whenever ye come together, each of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation". There is a reference to what each one possesses. We do not come empty. That which each possesses in his soul is what the Lord takes to make use of; and then He operates by means of the understanding that each possesses. He says, "*My* assembly" @Matthew 16:18. Here, it is the assembly *of God*. God operates by means of the understanding of each.
-- It may be that one brings what he has received as being with God during the week.
-- In the Old Testament, it speaks of the tithe which each one was to bring. In Malachi it says, "Bring the whole tithe into the treasure-house, that there may be food in my house, and prove me now herewith, saith Jehovah of hosts, if I open not to you the windows of the heavens, and pour you out a blessing, till there be no place for it" @Malachi 3:10. The principle is that we have something. We do not come together as empty vessels, but we have something, and God uses it. Coming to the meeting, I may have a very imperfect thought. I come, and I stand up, and God is there to help me to amplify it. The question is, What have I, to begin with? It is a matter of having something: "Each of you has a psalm". Now, we must use our intelligence. "If anyone speak with a tongue, let it be two, or at the most three, and separately, and let one interpret". There must not be too much; it is good to have a little, but not too much. Two brothers are not to speak at once, but each in his turn, and one is to interpret; "but if there be no interpreter, let him be silent in the assembly, and let him speak to himself and to God". Then, the apostle comes to the prophets: "Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others judge". God has special consideration for us, in these limitations, for the saints are limited as to their capacities.
{254}
Although prophecy is blessed, it is to be delivered in a restricted way.
-- It is a principle connected with the testimony of God in this world, because it says in Job that God used weight and measure.
-- A brother might say, I had something to say; I had to say it: and I could not sit down. But you should have been able to sit down, because the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets. There is perhaps another brother who has something, and the brethren ought not to be deprived of it, because it is something that comes from the Lord. Therefore in exercising our spiritual intelligence, we make room for others.
-- There is a man who has a revelation from God. I must give place to him.
-- What is a revelation from God?
-- Some new thoughts.
-- We were speaking of the temple and of the body. Your spiritual intelligence regulates rightly your contribution in the temple, and your contribution in love finds its support in the thought of the body. The two thoughts -- that of the temple and that of the body -- are found expressed here.
-- Would you say that such meetings have been given up because the limits in which they are given in the Scriptures have been exceeded?
-- The saints in a given locality are those who know one another best, and in that case the functioning of this chapter is easier. When they come together from various localities, the saints do not know the measure of others so well. When it is a question of the saints of one locality, they know one another so well that they discern if someone has a revelation.
-- It is not only for edification, but also for prayer and for praise.
-- The meeting for prayer is based on the same principles.
{255}
-- Do you think that, if it is a matter of a district meeting, it would be better to leave it in the hands of those who are gifted and who have the confidence of the saints?
-- It is perhaps a sign of weakness, that we have to do that; but we must accept the situation and act accordingly. Verse 26 does not say, 'When the whole assembly is together', but "Whenever ye come together". We prove how little we are in touch with one another in our spirit, and how little we know our measure. The Corinthians had written to the apostle on this point, and in developing it he lays stress on the gifts of prophecy, and finishes the chapter, "So that, brethren, desire to prophesy, and do not forbid the speaking with tongues. But let all things be done comelily and with order". That which might be regarded as being of least importance is not to be set aside. All is to be taken into account, however small it may be.
-- An important gift does not exclude a lesser.
-- At the end of the first epistle to the Corinthians, it says that one star differs from another in glory.
-- But love is necessary to realise these thoughts. Exercise is indispensable for each one, and each has received some gift of grace.
-- "At the most three", it says. What do you think, if there are four?
-- It is disorder. "Let all things be done comelily and with order". The limit given is the consideration of God for the saints. God would not wish there to be too much to take in.
Reading with J.T. at Bronac (Haute-Loire), 17th May, 1926, morning.
{256}
THAT WHICH IS GOOD FOR SOMETHING
@Jeremiah 13:1 - 11; @Revelation 11:1,2
The Old Testament prophets may be viewed as witnesses to the long-suffering of God, just as, at the present time, evangelical ministry is the testimony of the long-suffering of God. It says that accounting "the long-suffering of our Lord to be salvation" (@2 Peter 3:15), for God is not willing that any should perish; so that now we have a testimony to divine long-suffering in the presence of the assembly down here and of the Spirit who qualifies vessels for the preaching of Christ. The prophets correspond to this thought in a remarkable way. It even says that God saves at the dawn of the morning, such is His sustained interest for His people. What is presented in the prophets are signs indicating the ministry of each. The fact is manifested in a special way in Isaiah and Jeremiah. Isaiah has in view the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; His train filling the temple, while the seraphim proclaimed, "Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!" @Isaiah 6:3. It was the testimony that God had a throne and the means to bring everything into correspondence with His throne. As soon as the seraphim proclaimed His glory, the glowing coal taken from off the altar purged Isaiah. The prophet Isaiah then gives the testimony to the means that God has by Him to bring the whole earth into correspondence with His holiness. Isaiah is the great evangelical prophet; while showing us the throne of God and Christ seated thereon, he shows us also that same precious Person walking on this earth and bearing sins upon the cross. So, an African, a coloured man, a stranger to the blessings of Israel, receives from the mouth of the great evangelist
{257}
Philip, the good news concerning Jesus; he was reading the prophet Isaiah, and he went on his way rejoicing.
To Jeremiah also are given signs: first "a rod of an almond-tree" (@Jeremiah 1:11) representing the faithfulness of God; and then "a seething-pot" (@Jeremiah 1:13) turned from the north and representing the judgment of God. Thus we see on the one hand the eternal faithfulness of God, for it says, "I am watchful over my word to perform it" (@Jeremiah 1:12); if we apply that thought to our days, we see that God is about to fulfil everything that He has purposed; every one of His elect will be saved. On the other hand, the love and the grace and the goodness of God towards all are declared, for He desires that all men should be saved. That is what the rod of an almond-tree reminds us of, while the seething-pot reminds us of the judgment which will fall upon those who reject the gospel, for it says in the epistle to the Romans that "there is revealed wrath of God from heaven upon all impiety, and unrighteousness of men holding the truth in unrighteousness" @Romans 1:18. If therefore the gospel is rejected, there is only judgment for men.
In chapter 13 of Jeremiah, there is a remarkable figure supporting what I have just said. The word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah telling him to go and buy a linen girdle and put it upon his loins; then the word came again to him, saying, "Take the girdle that thou hast bought, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock". We have here a striking sign. Jehovah explains it further on, "For as a girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith Jehovah; that they might be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory; but they would not hear". If we apply this verse to ourselves, it deals
{258}
with a people in outward relation with God. God had acted toward Israel with the greatest consideration and the greatest affection. "As a girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah". It is a question of what God brought about; "*I caused to cleave unto me*". It is not a question of the result of the people's love; it is a question of what God brought to pass by outward means, so to speak. There are thousands today who have been affected by outward means. The gospel of God revealed in Christ has affected men, so that they have taken that position; but is there any moral value in that? The girdle was no longer good for anything. What was the secret? It had not been dipped in water. Jehovah said to Jeremiah, "Dip it not in water".
Those who are really believers in Christ have been dipped in water. There cannot be real and living faith if one has not been dipped in water. Our beloved Lord Jesus has been into the water, not that He had any need of it. However, He had to say, "All thy breakers and thy billows are gone over me" @Jonah 2:3. He "went down to the bottoms of the mountains" (@Jonah 2:6), like Jonah, who is a type of Him; He went down into the depths of the sea. "All thy breakers and thy billows are gone over me" @Jonah 2:3. "The waters encompassed me, to the soul" @Jonah 2:5. He suffered the judgment of God; and we must be brought to correspond to what He endured. Profession is worthless. As to appearance, we may be as near to God as a girdle that encircles the loins of a man. We may frequent the meetings; we may read the Bible; we may even partake of the Lord's supper; we may be identified with the saints, and we may not have been dipped in water, that is to say, we may not have appropriated the death of Christ. It says that on the day of Pentecost, all those who were converted were baptised.
{259}
That was not a religious form. The meaning of baptism is identification. "Those then who had accepted his word were baptised" @Acts 2:41. It was a matter of a real identification with the death of Christ. We can only be baptised once. Baptism is an event, a fact that remains during the whole of our life on earth. It was those who were baptised who "persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers" @Acts 2:42. Baptism was the sign that they had really been dipped in water. They publicly identified themselves with the death of Christ, but perseverance in the teaching of the apostles shows that they were subject and in fellowship. They took up Christian obligations, and the breaking of bread showed that they loved the Lord Jesus, and that they wished to keep Him in their affections. In other words, these three thousand believers showed that they had been dipped in water, and that their position in relation to God was not merely outward. If God had attached them to Him as a man attaches to himself a girdle round his loins, they showed that they were in that nearness and that they wished to remain there. They were attached to the Lord. That is what God brings about; He attaches us to the Lord. But if we love Him, we attach ourselves to Him. If there is not this reality, we are good for nothing. What a serious word! One may be a good citizen, a good neighbour, a good member of society, a man of business, and nevertheless be good for nothing in God's eyes. How serious it is! And the secret is that one has not been dipped in water. Then God announces His judgment.
You see the great care of Jeremiah, as well as his sacrifice, in order that God should cause this thought to penetrate into His people's conscience. There are three communications. First of all, Jehovah had said to him, Buy that girdle, and let it be of linen. Then it was a question of carrying it to the Euphrates.
{260}
"And the word of Jehovah came unto me the second time, saying, Take the girdle that thou hast bought, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock. So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as Jehovah had commanded me". It had to be hidden in a hole of the rock by the Euphrates. On the one hand, it is the means for the preservation of the girdle; and on the other, it is nearness to death. It is a question of the government of God towards His people; for later on, in His government, they were carried away to the Euphrates; but in His governmental ways, God shows His great care for us. The rock was to provide the preservation of the girdle. If we can possibly be preserved, God provides the means, but death is near at hand. If we would be preserved, it is a matter of accepting what is at hand. The believer who is such only by profession has only to appropriate the water of death which is near. In other words, God has acted in His governmental ways towards you. His love is behind all. It is for you to appropriate the death of Christ -- the only means of blessing. Faith will be accompanied by perseverance, for "they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers" @Acts 2:42. Those who despise those things cannot be good for anything. In so far as I submit to the teaching of the apostles and continue in the teaching and fellowship, in breaking of bread and prayers, I am good for something; I arrive at being of some value to God and to His people; otherwise I am exposed to divine judgment -- and good for nothing. That which is good for nothing must disappear, sooner or later; but, in the long-suffering of God, His gospel is still presented, and also a living, fresh ministry, in order that we may be subject and may be found good for something. At the beginning of the book of the Acts, we see those who became good for something. Think
{261}
of the way God used such believers! Think how those three thousand believers were good for something! They were brought into the assembly, vessels of divine glory. The one who, according to the second epistle to Timothy, purges himself from vessels to dishonour is "a vessel to honour, sanctified, serviceable to the Master, prepared for every good work" (@2 Timothy 2:21); he is good for something, which is the case with every true believer.
Now, in Revelation 11, God takes account of all that is good for something. "And there was given to me a reed like a staff, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship in it". The temple of God, at the present time, includes all those who have received the Holy Spirit. The temple is composed of those who are good for something. The apostle says to the Corinthians, "Do ye not know that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?" @1 Corinthians 3:16. How great and blessed it is to have part in the temple of God, where the Spirit of God dwells and the light of God is found! Beloved, think of the privilege of forming part of that temple! We are led to consider the reality of Christianity, each brother and sister forming part of the temple of God where He makes His light to shine. Am I going to continue to walk outside such a sphere? While coming to the meeting, while being with those who form part of the temple, am I going to remain at a distance? Why this distance? Love does not like this distance. "Come near to me" (@Genesis 45:4), said Joseph to his brethren. Love takes pleasure in nearness. In the epistle to the Hebrews, love says, "Having therefore, brethren, boldness for entering into the holy of holies by the blood of Jesus, the new and living way which he has dedicated for us through the veil, that is, his flesh, and having a great priest over the house of God, *let us approach* with a true heart" @Hebrews 10:19 - 22. That is an invitation
{262}
to every believer, now that the way has been dedicated through the veil; and God finds His pleasure in a true heart. "My son, give me thy heart" @Proverbs 23:26. God can make use of your heart, if it is a purified heart, a true heart. He invites you to approach; we can approach. Why not approach, if we believe in Christ? Why, if our hearts have been sprinkled from a wicked conscience? If you have a wicked conscience, you know the reason. God knows it, and so do you. Confess before the Lord, for He has the means of purification. "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins, and cleanse us from all unrighteousness" @1 John 1:9.
The Spirit insists, saying, "Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together" @Hebrews 10:25. If we assemble ourselves, it is that we may approach God to worship Him. Thus the temple is measured, likewise the altar and the worshippers. If there is an altar, it is that I may offer sacrifices. If Christ has sacrificed all for me, it is a question of my sacrificing. Peter says that we are "a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ" @1 Peter 2:5. That is all measured -- "the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship in it". All that is found there is real, true. What joy for heaven to consider the saints of God on earth in the light of the temple. They are independent of man; they are in the light and knowledge of God revealed in Christ; they have the Scriptures as oracles of God; they have the Holy Spirit to understand the Scriptures, and on them shines the light of God. Then, they have made sacrifices; they have forsaken the world; it may be they are ready to lay down their life for the brethren, for if we would correspond to Christ, we ought to lay down our life for the brethren.
The altar is measured, and then the worshippers. When the saints gather together "in assembly", they take up their priestly privileges. We are sons of
{263}
God; and as such we are perfectly free before Him, for we know the Father. We are priests; and as such we understand what is suitable to the service of God. We worship God "in spirit and truth" @John 4:23. These two things necessarily go together. I worship God in spirit, for God is a Spirit, and my spirit is in relation with God. But I worship Him also in truth, and I am to be in correspondence with Christ; truth is presented in Christ. We worship God in spirit and truth. All that is measured, for God takes account of it at the present time, dear brethren, and all that is outside of that is not measured -- the court, that is to say profession which has no value in His eyes, which is good for nothing. For the profession, there is only judgment. How solemn it is to have part in that which is left for judgment! May God bless His precious word!

THE ANOINTED VESSEL (9)
@1 Corinthians 15:1 - 19; @1 Corinthians 15:51 - 58
- At Valence and elsewhere, we have been occupied with the first epistle to the Corinthians and, in our readings, we reached chapter 14. It seemed good that we should be occupied a little this afternoon with chapters 15 and 16. What has been before us particularly has been the subject of the fellowship, the Lord's supper, order in the assembly and the ministry, so that the saints may be seen, in whatever locality, to correspond with the anointed vessel of the testimony. It is spoken of in chapter 12 where it is said, "So also is the Christ" (@1 Corinthians 12:12), the expression "the Christ" having reference specially to the saints of God being baptised by one Spirit into one body, and being given to drink of one Spirit. We have noticed the order in which the gifts have been placed in the assembly; although the assembly is the vessel in which the testimony is placed, it is not the assembly which preaches or teaches, as all ministry depends on the gifts given; so that we have the order in which the gifts have been placed in the assembly: "first" -- "secondly" -- "thirdly" ... @1 Corinthians 12:28.
-- So God insists on His order in everything.
-- In heaven there is an order, ranks among the angels; it is the same in the assembly on earth. However, this relates to public service and not to the family of God; so that the order in the assembly and the order of the ministry having been clearly brought out in this epistle, this chapter is occupied with the gospel that Paul had preached and the Corinthians had received.
-- The work of the Lord is to continue among us, and according as we understand the order in which it is to continue, we are to abound in it: "abounding
{265}
always in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil is not in vain in the Lord". Although what exists under our eyes may be very small in appearance, nevertheless our toil is not in vain "in the Lord". The chief end in this chapter is to stimulate Christians, that they may abound in the work of the Lord.
-- How is verse 2 explained? "Unless indeed ye have believed in vain".
-- There are thousands of persons who have believed in vain. They have believed without reaching the result, the salvation of their soul.
-- Is it possible to lack salvation at the present time?
-- It is like what is said in Hebrews, "*We* are not drawers back to perdition, but of faith to saving the soul" (@Hebrews 10:39), and in the first epistle of Peter, "Receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls" (@1 Peter 1:9), that is to say, salvation in its present application. It says, "By which also ye are saved (if ye hold fast the word which I announced to you as the glad tidings), unless indeed ye have believed in vain".
-- Is there an analogous thought in Hebrews 6 where it speaks of "those once enlightened" (@Hebrews 6:4) and who have fallen away?
-- In that passage, it is specially a matter of apostasy.
-- Those who had made a profession of Christianity.
-- "But we are persuaded concerning you, beloved, better things, and connected with salvation, even if we speak thus" @Hebrews 6:9.
-- Peter includes the thought when he speaks of "the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls" @1 Peter 1:9. The meaning of the "salvation of your souls" is deliverance from all that is contrary to us, now, as Zacharias said, at the birth of John the baptist, "we should serve him without fear in piety, and righteousness before him all our days" @Luke 1:74,75. There is "the salvation of souls"! The end is that we may
{266}
now be free for God. One takes "the helmet of salvation" (@Isaiah 59:17), which means that one can lift up the head without fear.
-- The sphere of salvation is within the walls of the city, is it not?
-- "I will give salvation in Zion, and unto Israel my glory" @Isaiah 46:13. It is said that "the Lord added to the assembly daily those that were to be saved" @Acts 2:47. It is in the Lord that we have salvation, and the Lord has down here a sphere which might be described as the sphere of salvation. Salvation is in His name, but the presence of the Holy Spirit provides a sphere in which believers may be saved.
-- Those who are there are "those that were to be saved", not those who were saved.
-- It is those who were in the thoughts of God. The apostle said that he endured all for the sake of the elect "that *they* also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory" @2 Timothy 2:10. As we saw this morning in Jeremiah, the almond-tree suggests vigilance; it is the "watchful tree" @Jeremiah 1:11, note. It is a question of the faithfulness of the Lord who watches over the elect that they may be saved. In that sense, the word of the gospel will be fulfilled.
-- When the prodigal son was still afar off, his father saw him. You see divine vigilance.
-- The arrival of Jacob at Bethel was not accidental. Heaven was watchful, so Jacob saw on earth the ladder which reached to heaven.
-- And the Lord said to Nathaniel, "When thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee" @John 1:48. This suggests vigilance among the divine Persons, who are watching here. "These are the eyes of Jehovah, which run to and fro in the whole earth" @Zechariah 4:10.
-- Should this vigilance be reflected in the house of God? The cherubim were looking outward, toward mankind.
{267}
-- Mark, who presents the thought of levitical service, finishes his instructions for servants saying, "But what I say to you, I say to all, Watch" @Mark 13:37. And the "overseer" watches over souls.
-- "Watch and pray".
-- With regard to the almond-tree that Jeremiah saw, the essential thought is the fulfilment of the word of Jehovah. It is said "And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond-tree. And Jehovah said unto me, Thou hast well seen; for I am watchful over my word *to perform it*" @Jeremiah 1:11,12. The word has been pronounced; it has gone out to all the earth. It is said in Deuteronomy "This commandment which I command thee this day is not too wonderful for thee, neither is it far off. It is not in the heavens, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to the heavens, and bring it to us, that we should hear it and do it? And it is not beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it? For the word is very near to thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it" @Deuteronomy 30:11 - 14. It is the word which we announce. Paul quotes this passage and says, "That is, the word of faith, which we preach: that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord, and shalt believe in thine heart that God has raised him from among the dead, thou shalt be saved" @Romans 10:8,9. So God watches over His word, that it may be accomplished. If there is a hard and obstinate heart, Jehovah says, "Is not my word ... like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?" @Jeremiah 23:29.
-- The meaning of the almond-tree is therefore vigilance?
-- "The Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs following upon it" @Mark 16:20. Is that the idea of vigilance?
{268}
-- The almond-tree is the first tree to blossom, is it not?
-- And there is always the testimony, because the book of Numbers presents the almond-tree as being the Lord Jesus in resurrection. And we are now in our subject, resurrection.
-- Here are twelve staves placed before Jehovah for the night, and only one of these staves buds, and brings forth buds, blooms blossoms and ripens almonds. Life is manifested there in its perfect order, and that, in the space of one night. That staff had to be kept, as a testimony before Jehovah against all rebellion. Thus we understand that the faithfulness of God is seen in Christ raised from among the dead. Not a single word of Jehovah's will fall to the ground. Not one of the elect will be lost.
-- @Psalm 90 is the "Prayer of Moses, the man of God" @Psalm 90:1. He says, in verse 6, speaking of the grass, "In the morning it flourisheth and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down and withereth" @Psalm 90:6. But in contrast with that, there is the almond-tree which appears at the end of the Psalm: "Let the beauty of Jehovah our God be upon us; and establish thou the work of our hands upon us: yea, the work of our hands, establish thou it" @Psalm 90:17.
-- In John, we see rather what is in perfection. There is hardly development, is there?
-- There is no development in Christianity. But the believer must begin and continue in a certain order. In 1 Corinthians 15, there is order, and it is said, "I make known to you, brethren, the glad tidings which I announced to you, which also ye received, in which also ye stand, by which also ye are saved (if ye hold fast the word which I announced to you as the glad tidings), unless indeed ye have believed in vain. For I delivered to you, *in the first place*" (there is the order), firstly, "That Christ died for our sins"; secondly, "that he was buried";
{269}
thirdly, "that he was raised the third day", and so on; so that Paul, in presenting the glad tidings, presented not only doctrine, but a living Person, who appeared, first, to Cephas, then to the twelve, then to above five hundred brethren at once, then to James, then to all the apostles, and finally to Paul himself.
-- What difference is there between "the twelve" and "the apostles"?
-- That is a good question. Here, the idea is to produce, by means of the glad tidings, first material for the assembly, then administrative authority, then the brotherly spirit, then individual steadfastness (in James), then apostolic authority. Finally, He appeared to the great architect of the assembly, Paul himself. The number twelve generally speaks of administration; that is what is seen in "the twelve", while "the apostles" present the authority of Christ in its fulness. It should be remarked that the Lord was first manifested "*to Cephas*". When Luke relates the same incident, he says, "The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared *to Simon*" (@Luke 24:34), because Luke would emphasise the grace of the Lord. *Simon* had denied Him, and it was a special grace that the Lord appeared to *him*. But when Paul speaks of it, he says that He appeared "*to Cephas*". Cephas means 'Stone' -- a stone for the assembly. Simon had been a poor erring one; and what applies to him applies to each one of us. The grace of the Lord is shown in His forgiveness, but in His mind, each one of us is a stone.
-- We ought to remember the strength that has drawn us; and we ought to remember at the same time the rock from which we are drawn.
-- "Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bore you", says @Isaiah 51:2. Sarah represents mankind as it was; while Abraham represents the purpose of God. Those two thoughts always go
{270}
together in the believer, whence the expression "a mixed condition" which some have regarded as error; but it is important to see that these two thoughts always go together.
-- What I am as a poor erring one, on the one hand, and what I am as a living stone, on the other.
-- In the first epistle to the Corinthians, we are "of God". He is the Rock which has begotten us; while in Romans, we have the compassion of God, who is our strength: "For we being still without strength, in the due time Christ has died for the ungodly" @Romans 5:6.
-- The elect must be saved; that is the thought of the rock.
-- Is the thought of the twelve and the apostles connected somewhat with @Psalm 133? There where unity is, the blessing is brought in. We see unity, in the twelve; then, the light is communicated.
-- The idea is rather what shone on the day of Pentecost. In appearing to Cephas, the Lord would have given him to understand the thought of the material proper to the assembly. In His appearing to the twelve, the Lord would have made them understand administration in the assembly. Peter said, in chapter 2 of the Acts, "Having therefore been exalted by the right hand of God, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which *ye* behold and hear" @Acts 2:33. What they saw on that occasion should have made a profound impression upon them as to administration, that is to say that they were not to be official, or severe, but rather adorned with the grace of Christ which would be reproduced in them. Ye have received gratuitously, give gratuitously as the Lord Himself said, "It is more blessed to give than to receive" @Acts 20:35. Afterward, He was seen of above five hundred brethren at once.
-- Was Matthias among the twelve?
{271}
-- Yes. "Above five hundred brethren at once" saw Him; the Lord would make them realise what brethren were.
-- Then if Matthias was there, the appearing to the twelve had taken place after Pentecost, and perhaps also to the five hundred. Before Pentecost, we do not read of five hundred brethren met together at one time.
-- The Lord took His place in the midst of those five hundred brethren, which must have left upon them a deep impression of what the brethren are. "Then he appeared to James", to show that He could do much by means of one man. In his epistle, James refers to Elias. How much Elias had accomplished, by himself!
-- It is said in Isaiah 51, speaking of Abraham, "I called him when he was *alone*, and blessed him and multiplied him" @Isaiah 51:2. He is a man who held the ground *alone* for God.
-- Is there not also the suggestion that the Lord would come down to quite a small number, to bring to them what is heavenly?
-- I think the suggestion would be specially what one man who has things at heart can accomplish. Elias was a man of like passions to us: he was not a supernatural man, but a man like ourselves. He prayed to Jehovah. "And he prayed with prayer that it should not rain; and it did not rain upon the earth three years and six months; and again he prayed, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth caused its fruit to spring forth" @James 5:17. That is what one man can accomplish who prays!
-- James closes his epistle by saying, "If anyone among you err from the truth, and *one* bring him back, let him know that he that brings back a sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall cover a multitude of sins" @James 5:19,20. It is what "one" can do.
{272}
-- We see examples of these great truths in the case of Gideon in the book of Judges. If only one remains, the authority of Christ can be maintained. Apostleship is emphasised in the gospel of Luke more than in any other gospel, showing what a great place the authority of Christ has. Unless there is complete submission to Christ, our faith will come to disaster. "Ye ... have obeyed from the heart the form of teaching into which ye were instructed" @Romans 6:17.
-- In John in Patmos, you see the only person who appeared to remain, but he was there in the light of the whole apostolic testimony, "for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus" @Revelation 1:9.
-- In the isle of Patmos, John had the advantage of a manifestation which Paul did not experience. How John must have been encouraged by the appearing of Christ Himself at Patmos! "And last of all, as to an abortion, he appeared to *me* also", says Paul, a man who had no recognised position, nor any right to a position, quite the contrary. So the Lord takes notice of a person of whom one would have never thought. And then the Lord worked in that vessel in such a way that Paul was going to carry out an effective ministry. "For *I* am the least of the apostles, who am not fit to be called apostle, because I have persecuted the assembly of God. But by God's grace I am what I am; and his grace, which was towards me, has not been vain; but I have laboured more abundantly than they all, but not *I*, but the grace of God which was with me". He had not himself any outward advantage among the saints. The natural thought would always be roused against him, saying, There is the persecutor! And he says, "By God's grace I am what I am", and that cannot be destroyed.
-- What encouragement for the smallest believer! "I am what I am".
-- In verse 10, "grace" is repeated three times.
{273}
-- Paul in the New Testament represents "the sons of Korah". They were under the divine judgment, but the rod of the almond-tree was God's answer. The history of the sons of Korah was very sad as to what they were in the flesh, but they were spared.
-- Paul speaks of himself as being the first of sinners. "But for this reason mercy was shewn me" (@1 Timothy 1:16), he says, "that in me, the first, Jesus Christ might display the whole longsuffering, for a delineation of those about to believe on him to life eternal" @1 Timothy 1:16. Paul is therefore presented to us as an example, for the worst among us, whether as a sinner saved by grace, or as a servant of Christ.
-- He would be the first on the list of sinners, and the last on the list of saints.
-- Such a man contributes enormously to the general good.
-- So he says, "His grace, which was towards me, has not been vain, but I have laboured more abundantly than they all, but not *I*, but the grace of God which was with me". Now, he has brought the gospel out clearly; and he resumes, saying, "Whether, therefore, I or they, thus we preach, and thus ye have believed". But who is this man among you, who says, There is no resurrection of the dead? The Corinthians were responsible for all that was preached among them. But some had not the knowledge of God. This chapter is the almond-tree, from one end to the other; the Spirit of Christ treats of the resurrection of Christ and of the saints, more than anywhere else in the Scriptures. Not only does he develop the fact that we have been raised, but he also presents "the heavenly" -- "Such as the heavenly one, such also the heavenly ones" @1 Corinthians 15:48. We have much need to study this chapter. The more we understand it, the more we shall enjoy it.
-- This chapter alone is a real volume.
{274}
-- We are here in the sphere of life and victory. Resurrection is, so to speak, the corner-stone of the whole Christian system.
-- Generally, in Christendom, the only place this chapter has is at the cemetery.
-- And many are very sorry that it is so long. However one proves how necessary it is, in connection with the public position of the assembly.
-- In this chapter, one is not taken off the earth.
-- Here, we have for the first time, "I tell you a mystery".
-- The opposition of some to the truth of the resurrection brought out a precious development of it.
-- The opposition of the Jews shows itself in a very special way in the gospel of John, and it is just in that gospel that the Lord unfolds the most profound secrets.
-- So Paul says here that he has fought with beasts at Ephesus, and it is exactly at Ephesus that the full truth of the assembly was brought to light. But God destroys all opposition by the greatness of the truth. He was courageous, to fight with beasts, but he was also faithful.
-- It is of the greatest importance that we should all lay hold of the bearing of resurrection.
-- The reason for the position of the Corinthians, with regard to resurrection, is that they had not understood the gospel of burial.
-- Then, Paul reasons with the opposer, "Fool; what *thou* sowest is not quickened unless it die. And what thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but a bare grain; it may be of wheat, or some one of the rest; and God gives to it a body as he has pleased, and to each of the seeds its own body" @1 Corinthians 36 - 38. This chapter therefore has its place rightly in this epistle, making us see that it is the work of God.
-- Resurrection is always beyond the range of the natural minds.
{275}
-- It is said of those who arose, at the end of Matthew, that "Going out of the tombs after his arising [they], entered into the holy city and appeared unto many" @Matthew 27:53. The power of resurrection is seen publicly.
-- The end of the chapter is a tribute to God. "Thanks to God, who gives us the victory by our Lord Jesus Christ. So then, my beloved brethren, be firm, immovable, abounding always in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil is not in vain in the Lord".
-- It is said at the end of the first chapter, "Of him are *ye* in Christ Jesus, who has been made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and holiness, and redemption" @1 Corinthians 1:30. Have we here the last thing -- redemption?
-- Yes. The apostle finishes his epistle with the subject of the collection. We make use of this expression "collection" as a formula, but the apostle speaks of the collection for the saints. It is not a thing to take up lightly. In all these chapters, God shows what has been active for the saints: "All things are yours. Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things coming, all are yours; and ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's" @1 Corinthians 3:21 - 23. Now, the collection is for the saints. In the matter of the collection we are in sympathy with God; and in this very epistle, it is developed. All that is said with regard to the collection is summed up in @2 Corinthians 9:15, "Thanks be to God for his unspeakable free gift". In @1 Corinthians 15:57, we have, "Thanks to God, who gives us the victory by our Lord Jesus Christ". The collection is linked with the unspeakable gift of His Son Himself, and the giving of the saints results in thanksgivings to God; so that the collection has a very special place in the position of the saints.
{276}
-- The bag (box) should not be put under the table, should it?
-- It is not under the table here, nor in the chapter that follows.
-- The collection is linked with the breaking of bread.
-- It takes place "on the first of the week" @1 Corinthians 16:2. Here it is a special collection for particular known needs at a distance. The Lord said, "Ye have the poor always with you". If there are no poor with us, there are many elsewhere.
-- The first day of the week supposes that one is in the eternal atmosphere of compassionate love.
-- It says, "On the first of the week let each of you put by at home, laying up in whatever degree he may have prospered, that there may be no collections when I come" (@1 Corinthians 16:2): but the spirit of giving should be maintained from week to week. The practical realisation of what the first day of the week means should be maintained in the heart of the saints.
-- Because the Lord said, "It is more blessed to give than to receive" @Acts 20:35.
-- In order to give, one must go down, speaking spiritually. Every gift has come from heaven. Christ has come from heaven; the Spirit has come from heaven. One gives.
-- Is that why the Lord so appreciated what the widow did?
-- "Jesus, having sat down opposite the treasury, saw how the crowd was casting money into the treasury" @Mark 12:41. The attention of the Lord is therefore held by the manner in which one gives.
-- The widow "has cast in more than all who have cast into the treasury: for all have cast in of that which they had in abundance, but she of her destitution has cast in all that she had, the whole of her
{277}
living" @Mark 12:43,44. She did what the Lord was going to do; she gave *all*, all that she had as a living.
-- Her contribution was not merely a formality.
-- The Lord, sitting opposite the treasury, saw *how* they were giving.

THE BELIEVER'S ROAD TOWARD THE SPHERE OF LIGHT, AUTHORITY, AND BLESSING
@Psalm 120; @Psalm 122; @Psalm 132:1 - 9; @Psalm 133
Most of the brethren present doubtless know that the Psalms which we have read are from the Songs of Degrees; these Songs go from Psalms 120 to 134. Prophetically, they indicate the journey which will be taken in the future by the remnant, from the place of their captivity to the place of their blessing. In that day, Jerusalem will be the centre of blessing; before reaching there, they will have the light derived from the Old Testament scriptures, indicating the purpose of God concerning Jerusalem; it is indeed His thought to be occupied with Jerusalem, for she is the city of the great King, to make her the centre of light, of rule, of blessing on the earth. There, He will command the blessing, which is "life for evermore".
I would like, however, to make an application of these Psalms to the present time, remembering that "as many things as have been written before have been written for our instruction" @Romans 15:4. Thus, these Songs of Degrees may illustrate the journey which a believer makes at the present time, held in captivity in the world, in order to reach the sphere of light, rule and blessing; that is, in other words, the sphere where God dwells. Many Christians have no idea that such a sphere exists; they regard heaven as the divine dwelling, and indeed it is a divine dwelling; but nevertheless, the house of God is never spoken of as being in heaven. The house of God is a sphere established on earth. The coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost signified that God had come to dwell here below, so that we read in the epistle to the
{279}
Ephesians that believers from among the Gentiles and from among the Jews are collectively the habitation of God by the Spirit. Speaking of us, Gentiles, it is said that we are no longer strangers, nor foreigners, but fellow-citizens of the saints, and of the household of God.
Having made the position of the believer clear, I would like to trace his progress, as we find it in these Psalms.
In Psalm 120, the believer is in captivity, and he cries, asking for deliverance. He says, "Jehovah, deliver my soul from the lying lip, from the deceitful tongue". Believers in Christ who are mixed up with the world, politically, socially, or even religiously, experience what is mentioned in these Psalms, and they are conscious of being in a foreign land, for they belong to a sphere of which I have just spoken, where God dwells; so they are conscious of the deceitful tongue, and ask to be delivered from it. We read later, in verse 5, "Woe is me, that I sojourn in Meshech, that I dwell among the tents of Kedar!" Those are regions foreign to one who belongs to Jerusalem, and he is not at all comfortable there. "Woe is me ..." he says, "My soul hath long dwelt with them that hate peace". And he continues, saying, "I am for peace; but when I speak, *they* are for war". Men are willing to be on good terms with us, as being in the world, and they are until the moment when we speak of Christ; for the heart of the believer desires to speak of the Lord, of God. Certainly, in confessing the Lord Jesus, we discover that "they are for war": the world hates the Lord Jesus. Satan will not acknowledge His rights; so, when the believer confesses the Lord Jesus, he finds that they are for war. But it is good to be warned in this way, regarding the place of our captivity, for, discerning the rights of Christ, we desire still more to be delivered; and there is a deliverance.
{280}
The following Psalm shows how deliverance comes: "I lift up mine eyes unto the mountains: whence shall my help come? My help cometh from Jehovah ..." @Psalm 121:1 - 2. So, dear brethren, if we are in such a state, in order to get out of it we must turn to God. He desires more than we do that we should be delivered, and He has means of deliverance at His disposal.
I cannot go into the details of these Songs of Degrees; I only wish to bring out the salient points, and I would like to remark that in Psalm 122 the house comes into his mind. He says, "I rejoiced when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of Jehovah". Other believers have also passed through the same exercises; perhaps they were exercised a long time before myself; they have followed the road; they have reached the end; they know what the house of God means, and at the needed time they said to me, "Let us go into the house of Jehovah", and "I rejoiced". That has often been said to young Christians, but they have not always rejoiced. Jacob's first experience as to the house of God made him say that it was a dreadful place; the secret of this was that he was in a bad state of soul. He said, "How dreadful is this place!" @Genesis 28:17. One is not happy when one is invited into a dreadful place. But twenty years after, Jacob was happy to enter there. God invited him to enter there; He said to Jacob, "I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, where thou vowedst a vow to me" @Genesis 31:13. God recalls to him an experience he had had twenty years previously. How often we repress or cast off such feelings! Jacob had had experience of the house of God, but he was content to remain outside for twenty years. Then, God told him to enter. "And God said to Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there, and make an altar unto the God that appeared unto thee when
{281}
thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother. And Jacob said to his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and cleanse yourselves, and change your garments; and we will arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar to the God that answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way that I went" @Genesis 35:1 - 3. He recognised that the house of God was a holy place, for God said, "Be ye holy, for I am holy" @1 Peter 1:16. So, when Jacob enters into Bethel the second time, he finds Jehovah there, not in heaven, as the first time, but as having come down to Bethel itself.
Many among us this evening have experienced the power of God in His house, and we would like to invite you to go there. "Let us go into the house of Jehovah". Does your heart rejoice at the thought of going there? It says, "I rejoiced when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of Jehovah!"
Now, dear brethren, I would like to show you how spiritual thoughts arose in his mind when the house was before him. He says, "Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem". You see, he thinks of Jerusalem, for the house was in Jerusalem. Jerusalem is a city, and the house is in a city. Our Jerusalem is heavenly. The New Testament speaks of "the holy city new Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God" @Revelation 21:2. And in Hebrews it is said that we are come "to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem" @Hebrews 12:22. A city suggests what is political. Perhaps you say, But I did not know that Christians were political. They are; they have a heavenly city. That is the reason we stand, and it is what we are awaiting. It is said in the epistle to the Philippians, "*Our* commonwealth has its existence in the heavens, from which also we await the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour" @Philippians 3:20. We also await the Saviour, so that, in the measure in which we
{282}
appreciate our heavenly capital, we are delivered from the politics of earth.
Speaking of Jerusalem, he describes it. He says, "Jerusalem, which art built as a city that is compact together". That city is quite different from a modern city. Modern cities are immense; some even reach beyond the boundaries laid down; their limits can hardly be discerned. But it is not so with the city of God; it is compact; it has definite limits. Many Christians have no limit, but seem to be able to move about here and there, without any sense of limitation. We ought to be placed within limits. We must be brought under rule, and this writer speaks of Jerusalem as being "compact together". He knew when he was outside, or when he was inside. The tribes went up there; could they not fix the moment when they entered the city? It says, "Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of Jah, a testimony to Israel, to give thanks unto the name of Jehovah".
He says afterwards that there are set thrones for judgment, the thrones of the house of David. Need I say, dear brethren, that David represents Christ and that these thrones will be occupied by those who belong to Christ? There we shall find judgment; no one will have to wait years for a judicial decision, as is usual in the courts of justice of this world. There are thrones of judgment, and these thrones belong to the house of David. Believers ought to learn now how to sit on thrones suitably. It is those who suffer who will sit on thrones. "If we suffer, we shall also reign with him" @2 Timothy 2:12. We learn at the present time to come to decisions. We have no need to go to the courts of justice of this world. The righteousness of God is in the assembly, so that judgment according to God is rendered.
Then, the believer asks that there should be prayer. He not only sees the gain connected with the city, but he asks others to pray for the peace of Jerusalem.
{283}
One is sometimes distressed to see how limited our prayers are. For us there is at present only one Jerusalem: that is the Jerusalem above. In fact it is the assembly here, and if we pray for it we pray for all saints. The Colossians and the Ephesians were characterised by love for all the saints, and they are exhorted to pray for them all. So he says, "Pray for the peace of Jerusalem". He sees that the testimony depends on Jerusalem. It is found in the world; he knows that there is war -- "they are for war" -- and he desires that peace may reign among the people of God, not however to the detriment of the truth, for we must pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace.
I would like you to notice that he speaks of "brethren"; he says, "For my brethren and companions¬ sakes I will say, Peace be within thee!" Are we fully awake to the fact that all Christians are our brethren? Do we know that there is such a thing as the family of God, to which all believers belong? Do we desire that all may have part in this city, this sphere of light, authority and blessing, and that peace may reign there? Then he says, "For my brethren and companions¬ sakes I will say, Peace be within thee!" The Lord Himself said, "Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another" @Mark 9:50. Salt preserves; it preserves us from corruption, and in that way we have peace in incorruptibility, as the apostle Paul says -- "with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption" @Ephesians 6:24. It is thus that we enjoy this peace among us.
Without going into the details, I wish to show you how we progress. In verse 7 of Psalm 124, it is said, "Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we have escaped" @Psalm 124:7. The believer now enjoys liberty; his soul has escaped. He has been in the snare of the fowler, but his soul has escaped. "The snare is broken, and we have
{284}
escaped". You see, dear brethren, he speaks of himself and of others. In all simplicity between us, we can speak in the same way. I know thousands of brethren who can truly speak in this way. We have been held in this foreign worldly element, whether political, social or religious; but "the snare is broken, and we have escaped". So we are free, in the freedom in which Christ has placed us; as the apostle says, "Christ has set us free in freedom; stand fast therefore, and be not held again in a yoke of bondage" @Galatians 5:1. He has set us free in freedom, certainly not liberty for the flesh, but for spiritual affections -- liberty to love one another, liberty to serve God, liberty to preach Christ. Is it not precious to be placed in liberty, dear brethren?
Time does not permit us to speak of the intervening Psalms. In the second verse of @Psalm 126 it is said, "Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with rejoicing: then said they among the nations, Jehovah hath done great things for them" @Psalm 126:2. He does not take all the credit to himself; it is God who has done it for him. He says, "When Jehovah turned the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream" @Psalm 126:1. None of us can deliver himself; but Jehovah has done it. God has turned the captivity of Zion, so that He now has His place in the soul of the believer. God has done great things for us; wherefore our mouths are full of laughter. You remember that "Isaac" means 'laughter'. Isaac is a type of Christ; He is a type of Christ, in that He occupies a whole position in the heart of the believer. When Ishmael is cast out, Isaac has in the soul of the believer an undisputed place; when Isaac occupies that place, there is a state of joy in the heart; our mouth is filled with holy laughter. It is Christ, now raised from among the dead, in whom all the promises of God are yea and amen. Our position is thus sure and stable. Also we read
{285}
in @Psalm 125, "They that confide in Jehovah are as mount Zion, which cannot be moved; it abideth for ever" @Psalm 125:1. You see we are now on the ground of purpose. It says, "Jerusalem! -- mountains are round about her, and Jehovah is round about his people, from henceforth and for evermore" @Psalm 125:2.
Dear brethren, I would now like to show you, in Psalm 132, how we begin to consider things in relation to Christ. Jehovah had had consideration for these Psalmists. For them He had done great things: He had brought them into a sure place; He was round about them. Now, Psalm 132, written doubtless by David, says, "I will not come into the tent of my house, I will not go up to the couch of my bed; I will not give sleep to mine eyes, slumber to mine eyelids, until I find out a place for Jehovah, habitations for the Mighty One of Jacob!" You see one is ready to renounce one's own comfort; one has left behind for ever one's private interest. The believer is in the light of what it has cost God, what it has cost Christ, to bring him into liberty; and he places the interest of God before everything else; he places the interest of God in the first place, in the second place, in every place, positively. He is then a vessel for the divine testimony. He thinks of God; he thinks of Christ; he thinks of divine interests and forsakes his own interests, even refusing slumber to his eyelids, until he had found out "a place for Jehovah, habitations for the Mighty One of Jacob". Now we also are concerned to gather the saints, because we see that the saints are a place for divine dwelling. As Peter says, we are "living stones" (@1 Peter 2:5); and Paul says that we are "built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit" @Ephesians 2:22. We read further down, "Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness, and let thy saints shout for joy".
The believer now looks at the field; he thinks of all the saints of God; in the language of the apostle
{286}
Peter, he considers them as a holy priesthood, but they need to be clothed with priestly garments. They must have to do with God, and God is holy, so that he says, "Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness, and let thy saints shout for joy". Priestly garments have a prominent place in the Scriptures. In the return from the captivity in the time of Nehemiah, it speaks of "priests¬ coats" (@Nehemiah 7:70) which were given for the work; the priests belong to the temple, and if they are to serve there, they must have priestly garments. As regards ourselves, the saints, these garments are "the righteousnesses of the saints" @Revelation 19:8. Priests recognise the rights of God and the rights of men. They are righteous in all respects. They are righteous in their houses; thus, they draw near to God. We are able to be occupied with divine things: we are the true house of Aaron. But here, what is essential is to be clothed with garments of righteousness. Then, as saints of Jehovah, we shout for joy. We find that in verse 16, God undertakes to answer the desire in verse 9: "And I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints shall shout aloud for joy".
In verse 13, it says, "For Jehovah hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his dwelling". You see that God makes use of what we prepare for Him. However religious human organisations may be, you can never find such a thing there; and we read later, "This is my rest for ever; here will I dwell, for I have desired it". And among other precious things, He says, "And I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints shall shout aloud for joy". You see, dear brethren, how God works in relation to our exercises. What the psalmist desired, God has brought to pass.
In Psalm 133, we have the culminating point -- the family. The other Psalms all refer to the experience of the believer, until he reaches a point which is
{287}
described as being "good and pleasant", and it is "for brethren to dwell together in unity". What an appeal to the people of God! The way is very clear for us, dear brethren, to break all our earthly links, in order to reach this place of holy liberty and of blessing. So he compares it to the dew of Hermon, but first of all to "the precious oil upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, upon Aaron's beard". The thought of brethren dwelling together in unity, according to God, involves the position of Christ in heaven. Before ascending to heaven, He sent the message to the disciples as to His brethren; afterwards, having ascended to heaven, He poured out the Holy Spirit, the precious oil with which He Himself had been anointed. It comes down to us -- "to the hem of his garments". Then, "the dew of Hermon" refers to the place of Christ exalted. The refreshment of heaven comes down, so that the saints are preserved, always green, in the energy of life. They are maintained in vigour of spiritual affection, as it is said, "Let brotherly love abide" (@Hebrews 13:1), for love according to God is "love in the Spirit" (@Colossians 1:8); so that, as I have said, there is a sphere in relation to the divine purpose -- "the mountains of Zion". Mountains are a symbol of strength; they are a figure of the power that exists among the brethren. There is in the brethren considered thus a correspondence to God Himself, for in Ephesians it speaks of "the power which works in us" @Ephesians 3:20. It is the power by which Christ has been raised, so that God commands the blessing. There is what is morally in accord with the divine will. If you analyse the epistle to the Ephesians, you will see how the will of God acts through the exercises of His people. There is "the good pleasure of his will" (@Ephesians 1:5), "the mystery of his will" (@Ephesians 1:9) and "the counsel of his own will" (@Ephesians 1:11). The will of God is one of the greatest things in the universe. I have no doubt that it is like the jasper that characterises the heavenly
{288}
city, the unfolding of the will of God in a vessel down here. Christ has been down here for His will, and so the assembly is also here for His will. The mystery of His will, therefore, will be fulfilled. No power can hinder what He commands. Think of the greatness of God who commands the blessing! He has "commanded the blessing", that is "life for evermore".
So you see in these Songs of Degrees how the believer obtains deliverance from this world, to whatever phase of it he may belong, and how he reaches the sphere of light, authority and blessing, where brethren dwell together in unity. Note that they *dwell* "together".
May God bless His word!
Address by J.T. at Paris, 20th May, 1926, evening.

SEPARATION (1)
@Matthew 13:1,2,36 - 52
J.T. I have been thinking of the house out of which the Lord went as said in verse 1, and the house into which He went (verse 36). The understanding of these two houses helps greatly in the understanding of the assembly. The Lord says in verse 51, "Have ye understood all these things?" They say to Him, "Yea, Lord". Then He adds, "For this reason every scribe discipled to the kingdom of heaven is like a man that is a householder, who brings out of his treasure things new and old". The instructed man is like a householder.
Another feature that marks this section is that they ask questions of the Lord; indicating that the transitionary period between the two houses is so complicated that there is a danger of missing our way in it; safety is in asking questions of the Lord. The disciples came up, saying, "Why speakest thou to them in parables?" @Matthew 13:10. That is a good question! Then in verse 36 He went into the house, and His disciples came unto Him, saying, "Expound to us the parable of the darnel of the field". And so you have an explanation, and an exposition. The explanation covers the *kind* of ministry, but the ministry itself has to be *expounded*.
The first house is a very solemn consideration, because it refers to the religious world in its family character, as affording social things; what ministers to the natural affections and desires of people. I think chapter 12 lays bare the things that were working in the Jewish house, and which correspond with the religions in the world today. Before the Lord leaves
{290}
that house, He exposes what is there. And so before any one leaves what he may have been connected with, the thing ought to be judged, as exposed to him. Chapter 12 is the exposure of what was in the Jewish house -- a terrible state of things, involving satanic workings.
Ques. Would the Lord leaving the Jewish house have an application to us?
J.T. Yes. If we understand chapter 12 we shall see the necessity for going out, for separating from the existing state of things around. But the house in verse 36 opens up the truth of the assembly, and is a reason for those who are in the light of it continuing where they are.
Ques. Would the first house be suggestive of Laodicea?
J.T. Just so. The Lord does not say one good word about Laodicea; indeed, it is the only church He has not a good word for. Nevertheless, although He is outside of it, He is standing knocking at the door, and saying, "If any one hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in unto him" @Revelation 3:20. That brings out His gracious service in this period; a service which would be reflected by those who are walking in the light.
Ques. Would the state of things in the house first referred to correspond with the state of things mentioned in 2 Timothy?
J.T. Pretty much, indeed. Therefore it behoves us to examine chapter 12, that we may see what is in the religious world around us.
Ques. Perhaps you would say a few words in connection with chapter 12, as to what is found in that house.
J.T. Well, first you will notice that the Lord calls attention to what was presented in the way of testimony to it; and in doing so He mentions different persons familiar to the Jews, such as David, Jonas
{291}
and Solomon; there was there in His own Person a greater than the temple, a greater than Jonas or Solomon, and He calls their attention to this.
Ques. Was that in order to attract to Himself whatever might be of God in it?
J.T. Exactly; and there were those who followed Him; they are seen at the end of the chapter: "And, stretching out his hand to his disciples, he said, Behold my mother and my brethren; for whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in the heavens, he is my brother, and sister, and mother" @Matthew 12:49,50. These were the results of the testimony presented. He also speaks of the "strong man": "how can any one enter into the house of the strong man and plunder his goods, unless first he bind the strong man? and then he will plunder his house" @Matthew 12:29. Now the Lord did that. His object was not to cleanse, or rectify the house, but to plunder it. Plundering it would mean taking the persons that were under satanic power out of it, delivering them. Now I think that is what God has been doing for many years past. He has been presenting a powerful testimony in Christendom, and some have been affected by it; they are doing the will of God, and so the Lord regards them as His brethren.
Rem. It also says in that chapter, "He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathers not with me scatters" @Matthew 12:30. That is a very solemn consideration.
J.T. Yes, indeed! Some say, Why not remain where you are, and improve things there? But what was the Lord doing? He was plundering the strong man's house. In chapter 11 they had definitely rejected Him. He upbraids the cities where His works were done.
Rem. Well, if He has left such an house, we should surely not be found in it. We should be found with Him.
J.T. Yes; He exposes it for us, so that we may
{292}
judge and leave it. For no one should leave any place where God has been known without *proving* that the Lord is not there.
Ques. Would the fact of the Lord having left the house be sufficient authority for one to leave it also?
J.T. Surely. He tells you why; chapter 12 exposes what is there. So you leave that house intelligently.
Ques. Would you leave that house without having an object before you?
J.T. The Lord is giving us a lead here. *He* is the object before us. We go forth unto Him without the camp. His position is defined, and there is reproach attached to it too.
Ques. Is this the way to the assembly?
J.T. Yes. The first thing is that you leave the house, namely, the religious system, whatever its name, that has proved unfaithful to Christ. Such systems no doubt afford much for the natural heart in its social affairs; but it is remarkable how the evil and poverty of them has been exposed in these days.
In Matthew the Lord invariably reflects on Jerusalem -- on the worldly system that then existed. In Matthew's gospel the Lord at the end meets His disciples in Galilee. Distance from Jerusalem is implied. In Luke's gospel it is said that He led them as far as to Bethany; that is a very short distance; He led them out, but they were near enough to be a witness. The distance between Jerusalem and Bethany was fifteen furlongs; they could thus conveniently return to Jerusalem, which they did. The record in the Acts shows that they were there as witnesses to Christ in grace. You can tell the most hardened about Christ in grace; the Lord will leave you near enough for that. But when it is a question of church relations, of fellowship, He says, as it were, You must go far away; you must make a great distance between you and Jerusalem. Hence according
{293}
to Matthew He sends a message to His brethren that He would see them in *Galilee*. They had to take a long journey from Jerusalem. That is the point in Matthew's gospel. You cannot make the distance too great, from the standpoint of fellowship; there must be no mingling. A certain class of brethren well known to us do not go far away from Jerusalem. Not that one wants to accuse, but the principle of their fellowship was, so to speak, very near Jerusalem to begin with, and it remains there still.
Rem. That recalls to one's mind Pharaoh's request to Moses, namely, that he and Israel should not go far away from Egypt.
J.T. Yes, indeed; but the Lord would put a barrier between them and Pharaoh.
Rem. And does not the enemy still continue to make that suggestion: You may go a little way in separation, but not *too* far?
J.T. Yes. Occasionally you hear of people going back to the systems they had left; but the truth is they do not have far to go; for they did not go far enough away at the outset. Questions are asked later on in the chapter (@Matthew 13:54 - 58) by His enemies. That is a different matter. They are infidel, antagonistic questions. The Lord does not answer them. They have been answered. But the questions we have been considering are very different; they are questions asked by people who greatly desired to hear the Lord's explanations.
I think it is very important to keep in mind that Matthew removes you as far as possible from the religions of the world; and there must be no going back, or intermingling, for that would nullify the fellowship. What has actually happened in some cases is that brethren, giving up separation, start mingling with the current religions around, and though they may retain the right name, the power is gone.
Rem. So that, clearly, no compromise can be
{294}
tolerated. The word is, "whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in the heavens, he is my brother, and sister, and mother" (@Matthew 12:50) and is not that the test?
J.T. That is the test; and with that the Lord marks His brethren off. Then another house is seen, and a family circle; a house marked off, you might say, as of God. Into that house you may safely go!
Ques. Would it not be possible to take up the principle set forth in Matthew, and omit that which is set forth in Luke?
J.T. Then you would be unbalanced. The assembly and the gospel go together; but Matthew insists on separation with a view to the truth of the assembly being maintained. In chapter 16 the Lord left the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and departed; not only did He leave them, but He went away to a distance from them. And again, in chapter 24, we read, "And Jesus went forth and went away from the temple" @Matthew 24:1. He went away from it, He put a distance between Himself and it. That is the teaching in Matthew. But in Luke's gospel the distance is not so great because He would have the grace of God presented to the Jews. You must present the grace of God, or the dispensation is lost sight of. So in Luke He says, "remain in the city till ye be clothed with power from on high" @Luke 24:49. They were to preach repentance and remission of sins in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
Rem. Abel would be on Matthew's line, and what was seen in David on Luke's. Abel was in spirit apart from the state of things around, and offered his sacrifice, recognising what was due to God; then, on the other hand, David expressed the desire to show the kindness of God to any of the house of his enemy, Saul.
J.T. Of course it was for Jonathan's sake. When David heard that Saul and Jonathan were slain, he
{295}
rent his clothes. His grief was not feigned; it was real. He thus sets out this dispensation from the standpoint of grace. We must not be daunted by persecution, and we must be greater than the enmity.
Rem. The queen of Sheba is referred to in chapter 12. She took a long journey to get answers to her difficult questions.
J.T. Yes, and here was a greater than Solomon; but the Jews were not taking advantage of His presence.
Rem. Sometimes people go to the wrong person with their questions; but the Lord is able to answer every question, and He is at hand.
J.T. Souls feeling their way out of the house of chapter 12 come in for great consideration, because it is a transitional state of things, and more or less foggy. We must not assume that they have the sunlight that we enjoy; we little realise how much fog and difficulties are in people's minds; hence very great patience is necessary in answering their questions.
Rem. The men of Jabesh-Gilead were blessed by David because they buried Saul. And again in the case of Abner, David and all the people were found weeping; and David himself fasted until the going down of the sun, and the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; @2 Samuel 2:5; @2 Samuel 3:32,36.
J.T. One of the most interesting passages in David's history is the record of what took place at Ziklag in connection with those who were unable to cross the torrent Besor. It was there he commenced to make statutes. The men of Belial, of those that went with David, said, "Because they went not with us, we will not give them aught of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart" (@1 Samuel 30:22); but David said, "Ye shall not do so ... for as his share is that goes down to the battle, so shall his share
{296}
be that abides by the baggage: they shall share alike" (@1 Samuel 30:23,24). David there sets out the principle of overcoming evil with good. Then in the opening of the second book of Samuel he is at Ziklag; and you find that there he sets out the position indicated in the epistle to the Romans. He is at Ziklag for three days; a period of exercise. Then an Amalekite came out of Saul's camp, with tidings of Saul; and, thinking that David would be like himself, a natural man, revengeful, and delighted to hear of his enemy being slain, he said, "I happened by chance to be upon mount Gilboa, and behold, Saul leaned on his spear; and behold, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him. And he ... saw me, and called to me ... . He said ... . Stand, I pray thee, over me, and slay me ... . So I stood over him, and put him to death" @2 Samuel 1:6 - 10. He thought that David would have been glad, and given him a reward, but instead, David lamented, and had the Amalekite slain. And then he puts his exercise on record; "The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen" @2 Samuel 1:19. He was moved by divine feelings. He could not but lament that the Philistines had gained the victory over one who had been anointed with oil. And so it is, as we look from that point of view at our fellow-Christians, nominally, who have been overcome, we do not rejoice, but rather deplore their shame.
Rem. God has been pleased to record David's feelings on that occasion.
Ques. What is the position now, in view of the end of @Matthew 12?
J.T. The parable indicates an extraordinary situation; a situation, really, that gave occasion for His leaving the house. That is to say, there were mixed results; and His disciples want to know why He speaks in this way. For the believer, at that stage, it was a transitional period, and the ministry is parabolic, it is intended to hide the truth; a very remarkable
{297}
thing; many would say, Make it as plain as you can, bring it down to the level of the people, make your remarks popular; whereas the Lord was hiding the truth; only the initiated could understand it. Things are not learned in Christianity as they are learned in a public school, where everything is made as plain as possible for the natural mind to understand. God is not dealing with the natural mind at all; He is dealing with the spiritual mind; and I have to ask questions of Him. He had spoken to them plainly, and they had rejected His words; but now, He says, I will hide it, and thus you must expose yourselves. It is a *judicial* exposure on God's part; men are exposed because they have not got the Spirit; like the foolish virgins they have no oil, their lamps are gone out, and they are left outside. The true believer, having the Holy Spirit, understands the parables.
Rem. The Lord here immediately answered the questions of His disciples.
J.T. Yes; He said, "it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it is *not* given" @Matthew 13:11. It is now a question of the sovereignty of God. What the Jews had, they held in a natural way, but now there is something which they cannot understand in a natural way, because it is purposely hidden; the understanding of it depends on the Spirit. The spiritual understands "all things" @1 Corinthians 2:10.
Rem. It is a mercy they cannot understand it, because it would only make them worse.
J.T. Good soil is a man with "an honest and good heart" @Luke 8:15. That is to say, you want to know the matter, and you have no selfish motive; the seed falls on good ground, and it springs up and bears fruit. If it falls on any other ground there is no definite result for God. It is well to know whether people are honest in regard to what they profess to seek. Are they leaving the first house because perhaps things were personally unsatisfactory, and not
{298}
for spiritual reasons? If so, they are disqualified.
Rem. The two disciples of John went after the Lord; He saw them following, and said to them, "What seek ye?" And the answer they gave showed there was an honest exercise; "Teacher, where abidest thou?" And He said to them, "Come and see" @John 1:38,39.
Rem. It is remarkable that they wanted to know where He dwelt. The Lord led to that. It suggests the family idea -- where He dwells!
Ques. How would you regard believers who have left us? Would you regard them from the grace point of view?
J.T. Well, we have to accept their decision. The gracious attitude of God towards all is a feature of the dispensation, but the attitude seen in Matthew has also to be maintained. Some of us were speaking about manhood being the guarantee for the maintenance of the dispensations, like the trees that grew on the banks of the river, of which we read in @Ezekiel 47:6,7,12. The seventh verse would suggest what God set up in the way of men at the outset, as a result of Christ's ministry, and that of the apostles; and those referred to in verse 12, those that grew up in the dispensation itself. In either case they are trees, and are suggestive of spiritual persons; "it shall bring forth new fruit every month, for its waters issue out of the sanctuary; and the fruit thereof shall be for food, and the leaf thereof for medicine" @Ezekiel 47:12. Now in these men you have the principles of the dispensation revealed; and so you find in the Acts that distinct persons are called attention to: first there is Peter, then John, Barnabas, Stephen, Philip, and then Paul.
Now, referring to the ministration of grace; Philip represents manhood as seen in preaching the gospel. There is great need of preaching; are we exercised about it? Some may say, Well, we have no gift, and
{299}
that may be so; but you never can tell that you have gift until you begin to preach. Scripture does not say a word about Philip having gift, or even a mission. It says, "Philip, going down to a city of Samaria, preached the Christ to them" @Acts 8:5. And that, I believe, is intended to remind us that the preaching is to go on. He went himself; it does not say anybody went with him. You may perhaps say, The brothers do not give me the hall, nor do they ask me to preach. There is not a word in @Acts 8 about Philip being *asked* to preach; he "going down to a city of Samaria, preached the Christ to them; and the crowds with one accord gave heed to the things spoken by Philip ... and there was great joy in that city" @Acts 8:5 - 8. He corresponds with the man on the bank of the river. You see what resulted from a man preaching on his own initiative; and then God comes in and speaks to him through an angel. That is to say, God intervenes providentially to help such a brother. The angel says, Go down to the desert. There is nothing to minister to the flesh in a desert! And as he goes down the Holy Spirit says to him, "join this chariot" (@Acts 8:29); and He gives him one man to preach to. So Philip joined himself to the chariot; he is to be linked up with that man -- an Ethiopian. That was not anything for the flesh. The eunuch was reading the Scriptures. It is all the Holy Spirit now; the black man is converted soundly, and goes on his way rejoicing. Philip went down into the water with him; he identified himself with him; and when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more. Then, too, it is most remarkable that Philip is the only one in Scripture called an evangelist; and he commenced his service as of himself, as far as the record goes; and it was under very uninviting circumstances, for there was a great persecution raging at the time.
{300}
Rem. If one were exercised, and on the lookout for individual souls each day, what a testimony would go forth!
J.T. Yes, I am sure of it. It is a question of doing what your hand finds to do. And remember that the congregation is the world. The first great preaching, as far as we know, was when Peter "lifted up his voice" (@Acts 2:14) (in the open air, no doubt) and spake to those around him, and about three thousand souls were converted. It is true that preaching depends on gift, but one must begin, and it is in the service the gift develops. As you see the need and seek to meet it, the Lord helps you.
Rem. Philip was one of the trees which the Lord had planted.
J.T. Yes; he was on the bank.
Rem. The Ethiopian eunuch was a most important convert.
J.T. He was; and I think God shows in Philip how He would overcome national rivalry and prejudice. The Jews had no dealings with the Samaritans, and He would also give Philip the honour of speaking to one of the sons of Ham. It is interesting to notice that Philip is used to the conversion of the eunuch; the Lord converts Saul, and Peter has to do with Cornelius. In the house we have been looking at, there was plenty of religious form, but it was according to man's will; but the house where the Lord is with His disciples, every one is adjusted; so that we go back again to Jerusalem in a very different way to that in which we left it; we go back in the spirit and power of Christ.
Rem. It has been said that unless one is qualified to preach amongst the saints he should not go outside to preach.
J.T. What we are speaking of refers to the preacher's responsibility; the saints committing themselves to him is another matter. We should get
{301}
into our minds the idea the Holy Spirit intends to convey in regard to what Philip did.
Rem. In Acts 21 Philip is mentioned as the evangelist, and it says he had four daughters, virgins, which prophesied.
J.T. That is very interesting. I suppose they would not be carried away by what he said, simply because he said it. *They* would have the mind of God about things.
{302}
SEPARATION (2)
@Mathew 13:36 - 52
J.T. For those who were not at our meeting last evening, it may be remarked that we dwelt on the earlier part of this chapter, fixing our minds on the house from which the Lord departed, as recorded in the first verse; that it had allusion to the then accepted religious system of the world, viewed as in its family or social features; a 'house' suggesting what relates to family and social affairs. The Lord left that house, the features of which were laid bare in chapter 12. And it may be remarked further that He sat down "by the sea" (@Matthew 13:1) -- not that He intended to remain by the sea, but to indicate that He had taken up *another* position, which had a wide bearing, the sea denoting access to the Gentile world. I thought that tonight we might consider the question asked in verse 36, and what developed from it.
W.H.M. If I remember aright, you connected verse 36 with the last verse of the previous chapter.
J.T. Yes; as you were remarking in prayer, the Lord indicates those who should be in family relation with Him, and that family relation must find its place in the second house into which He entered "whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in the heavens" @Matthew 12:50. The second house into which He entered must include those who are in family relationship with Him, based on the doing the will of His Father who is in heaven.
What I thought would be helpful, particularly for believers who are seeking a way from the one house to the other, was to speak of the advantage of asking questions of the Lord, the readiness with which He answers, and the further light vouchsafed. It is very encouraging, because these questions are not captious;
{303}
they are honest inquiries, with a view to learning. The Lord delights in answering such. First, why should He speak a parable? (verse 10.) And then they ask for an exposition, "Expound to us", they say, "the parable of the darnel of the field". A very solemn fact comes to light in the Lord's remarks in answer to their first question, namely, that to those that were *without* He would speak in parables; He says, "to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it is not given" @Matthew 13:11.
Rem. He gives them credit for having ears to hear, and yet He has to unfold what is His mind for them.
Ques. There are many apparently honest and sincere Christians in the systems who make inquiries, and yet remain where they are -- how would you account for this?
J.T. Well, I think they come under the heading of those referred to in 2 Timothy, as "always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth" @2 Timothy 3:7. If there are honest inquiries, there will be answers from the Lord; and then you would expect movement, because it is a very serious matter to be in a position where the truth is hidden. To those without, the truth is ministered in parables; and the Lord explains: "For this cause I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear nor understand; and in them is filled up the prophecy of Esaias, which says, Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand, and beholding ye shall behold and not see; for the heart of this people has grown fat" @Matthew 13:13 - 15. This is judicial, having reference to those who, having heard the truth, refused it. It is not that every one in the systems comes under this category, but that worldly systems are characterised by this. The Lord had ministered to them in the plainest way, according to the earlier record in this gospel, but they did not
{304}
receive what He ministered, and now the truth is enveloped in a parable, which renders it beyond the reach of all but those who are initiated -- a very solemn consideration. So that we ought to speedily get out of such a position, and get into one in which the Lord is heard speaking 'plainly' and not in parables, as we learn elsewhere. You want to get the direct words of the Lord. The same thing, indeed, is seen in the book of Revelation; it is enshrouded in symbols. Anyone can see at a glance that the Revelation is very different from John's gospel, although written by the same person. John's gospel is direct ministry to the saints; the Revelation is indirect, because of the retrogression that had set in amongst the people of God. There had been the giving up of the truth, and hence the ministry is enshrouded in symbols. Christendom, as it is, is shut out from the book of Revelation. But why? Because of general unfaithfulness. The book is not shut up to those who have the Spirit of God. And so the parables are perfectly intelligible to the people of God. "blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear" @Matthew 13:16.
Ques. What would be the cause of bringing about such a state as you speak of?
J.T. Disregard of, and want of appreciation of direct ministry. If we are not appreciative of direct ministry, the Lord will have to deal with us judicially; the truth is presented, so that there is responsibility on all as to it, but it is clothed in parables.
S.C. In chapter 12 the Lord is presented in a very remarkable way -- greater than Jonas, and greater than Solomon, greater than the temple -- why is this?
J.T. That is to bring out the wonderful testimony presented to the Jews. "But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons", He says, "then indeed the kingdom of God is come upon you" @Matthew 12:28. That was the fact; it
{305}
was there, and they were neglecting and despising it. Indeed, they were attributing it to Beelzebub. Satan was working, but the Lord exposes it, and He definitely leaves that house. They announced to Him, "thy mother and thy brethren are standing without, seeking to speak to thee" @Matthew 12:47. But He answered, "Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren; for whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in the heavens, he is my brother, and sister, and mother" @Matthew 12:49,50. So that the break is complete; and His sitting by the sea means, with other things, that He is not going back to the position He left; for it is an apostate condition of things; their house is left unto them desolate. The ministry goes on, but it is hidden in parables.
That is one lesson. The next is that there are two kinds of sowing; one is the pure and unadulterated word of God, and after it had been sown, the fowls came and devoured up the seeds that fell by the wayside; and the sun scorched that which had fallen in stony places, because there was no deepness of earth, and because they had no root they withered away; some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up and choked them; and then He points out the soil that was fruitful.
In the next parable, it is not the word of God that is spoken of; the seed is persons, which raises a very important consideration. It is not now simply that the word of God is sown, but "the sons of the kingdom". They are really the outcome of the first sowing. And then Satan sows opposingly. The word in verse 38, "children", (King James translation) is really "sons". Sons are developed persons. There are "the sons of the kingdom", and "the sons of the evil one".
Ques. How would you explain the term, "sons of the evil one"?
J.T. Well, they are *developed* in the knowledge of
{306}
Satan's ways; they are avowedly there to oppose and counteract what God is doing. The sowing of the 'tares' was by the 'enemy'.
Ques. Would you connect them with those referred to in @2 Timothy 3?
J.T. They are similar; persons who say false things; they are bad teachers. They are deliberately counteracting, as far as they can, what God is doing, and corrupting it. It is a terrible thing, and they remain during the whole dispensation. This cannot be altered, they go on to the end.
Ques. So this would apply specially to the present moment?
J.T. Yes.
Rem. "The heart of this people has grown fat, and they have heard heavily with their ears, and they have closed their eyes as asleep, lest they should see with the eyes, and hear with the ears, and understand with the heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them" @Matthew 13:15.
J.T. Now, when the Lord enters into another house, His disciples come to him and they want an exposition. It is now not a question as to the kind of ministry, parabolic or plain, but an exposition. And so the Lord opens up what the parable of the tares means. Before we can be in the house that He enters into aright, we have to know how to discriminate between the sons of the kingdom and the sons of the wicked one. Christendom is honeycombed with sons of the wicked one; they misrepresent what is of God; they work by imitation.
Ques. You connect "sons of the evil one" with false teachers and doctrines?
J.T. Yes. Men fully cultured in the knowledge of Satan's ways; and their preparation is in order that they should be that, because the word 'sons' implies growth or development. They are not babes, they are sons.
{307}
Rem. In another place He says, "Ye are of the devil, as your father" @John 8:44.
J.T. Well, there it is more *origin*, but here it is development of satanic ways; they are avowed adversaries, and their teaching has always that in view.
Rem. The source of it is satanic.
J.T. Yes; it is Satan's deliberate work; he could not blot out Christianity by persecution; he tried it, and did not succeed, and so he brought in a counter movement, marked by imitation.
Rem. That is a very solemn consideration for us we should require anointed eyes.
Ques. Are they mentioned in Ephesians 2; "the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience" @Ephesians 2:2?
J.T. Perhaps that is more general in the world: but these are distinctly seen in the Lord's 'field'. The field is here, and the right to it has been acquired by Him. Satan sees what He is doing; he cannot blot out Christianity by persecution, so he brings in something like it, because the 'darnel' resembles the 'wheat', but it is of no value as a crop; it looks like wheat, and therefore an imitation -- Satan's most effective way of opposing the truth of God.
Ques. Is this what involves separation; seeing that the wheat and the tares grow together, that is, the sons of the kingdom and the sons of the wicked one?
J.T. Separation is the only way. When He says, "Suffer both to grow together" (@Matthew 13:30) He means that Christendom was not to be reformed. It does not mean that we associate with them at all. Judgment will be executed on them at the end.
Rem. You do not contend with them; you just leave them.
J.T. Yes. "An heretical man after a first and second admonition have done with" @Titus 3:10.
{308}
Ques. Would not the spirit that animated Abigail in going out to meet David separate us from the first house to which you directed attention?
J.T. Just so. David is presented in Scripture as a type of Christ. He is attractive; his appearance is beautiful; he had beautiful eyes, we are told, and was ruddy; and so he became an object of affection amongst the people; he was loved by Jonathan, and loved by all Israel. Absalom was also a man of beautiful appearance, but it was connected with human culture; polling his head, and all that sort of thing; his opposition took the form of kissing the people, etc., thus stealing their hearts from David.
Rem. He spoke ill of David, and suggested that they needed someone to take their part, and plead for them.
J.T. He injected into them the poison of distrust; that David was not doing his duty, but he would do it; he made promises, like a politician. He is a type of antichrist.
What comes out in the second book of Samuel is in connection with *wisdom*; the wisdom that discerns the deliberate working of Satan is the wisdom of God.
Now the Lord, in this house, after explaining the parable of the tares, tells them about the kingdom of the heavens being "like a treasure hid in the field, which a man having found has hid, and for the joy of it goes and sells all whatever he has, and buys that field". That brings up another thing, namely, we must not court publicity. The introduction of the assembly in this parable is to call attention to the importance of being hid; not seeking publicity in this world.
Ques. What is suggested by the treasure being hidden, in the first instance, and then when the man found it *he* hid it?
J.T. Well, the first hiding has allusion to what God had done; it was hid in God. God in His
{309}
eternal purpose had the assembly before Him, but it was hidden throughout all the dispensations. The secret things belong to Him. In the ministry of Christ I think *He* found it; He found it in the responsive affections of the disciples. The man found the treasure; it does not say he was looking for it. But in the second parable (verse 45) the merchant man is *seeking* goodly pearls, and he found one of great price, and went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
Ques. Would that be the mystery?
J.T. Well, in verse 45 the Lord was looking for goodly pearls, but found one of great price. This is the assembly.
Ques. Would the hiding in verse 44 suggest that Christianity was not to come to the front in any way?
J.T. Yes; it does not belong to the items of knowledge in the world; it is known to those who are spiritual. First of all the thing was hidden in God; then it came under the Lord's eye; and this treasure would afterwards develop in the assembly. It was found by the Lord in His disciples. God put it there. Coming in as Man, He waited for things to come about, so when the Father reveals something to Peter, the Lord recognises it, and He says, "flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens. And I also, I say unto thee that thou art Peter, and on this rock I will build my assembly, and hades¬ gates shall not prevail against it" @Matthew 16:17,18.
Rem. He called it *my* assembly.
J.T. Yes, He would have an assembly; but what came under His notice was in Peter, and the Father had put it there. Then He says in effect, This is not for publicity yet. He found it hidden, and He rehides it, and instructs them concerning it; He charged them "that they should say to no man that he
{310}
was the Christ" @Matthew 16: 20. Things are now to be known spiritually, and not in a public way, and that covers the whole of this dispensation; it is a time during which the things of God are hidden. Such knowledge was not to be within the range of the natural man. 'Theology understands it not'.
Ques. Is that why these things are spoken of as the "mysteries of the kingdom" @Matthew 13:11?
J.T. Just so; but they are not mysteries to those who have spiritual understanding.
Ques. Is this what the apostle Paul desires the saints should know in his epistle to the Colossians?
J.T. Well, that is the thing in its completeness. Here it is "the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens"
(@Matthew 13:11) there it is the "mystery of God" @Colossians 2:2.
Ques. In order to understand this scripture should we not require first to know what the assembly is?
J.T. You can understand Matthew, because you are in the assembly, and have the Spirit. Matthew was written long after the truth of the assembly came out. Indeed it was written to confirm this truth; it was necessary on account of the reprobate character of the Jewish system.
Ques. Would you say Satan used Judas to bring to those outside what was inside?
J.T. Yes; he carried the secrets of Christ's circle out into the world. John speaks of false prophets going out into the world.
Ques. I should like to ask, Do we get the way to the assembly in the next chapter -- I refer to Peter leaving the boat?
J.T. We only get suggestions in these chapters; we are at school, so to speak, and we are asking questions, and the Lord is answering them; but He is giving much more than we asked for. This is the first great lesson. It is what you might call the initial lesson, where you get things just touched upon; afterwards they are taken up and enlarged
{311}
upon. These are said to be parables of the kingdom, not of the assembly. The Lord says, "For this reason every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a man that is a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old". It is a question of the kingdom of the heavens; the different features of it.
Rem. And it is the diligent one that learns, and gets understanding and the knowledge of God; as we have it in Proverbs 2: "if thou seekest her as silver and searchest for her as for hidden treasures: then shalt thou understand the fear of Jehovah, and find the knowledge of God" @Proverbs 2:4,5.
J.T. Yes, we see here how the mystery comes to light; we see that the Lord *found* the pearl; He was on the lookout for it. He was *seeking* goodly pearls. Laziness marks most of us. There is very little agility of mind to find things. We see how the Lord found the thing.
Ques. Do I understand you to mean that in the presentation of the mystery, we should seek not to make it as a public thing in the world?
J.T. You retain it as a mystery as regards the world. As the world rejected Christ, thus showing itself reprobate, divine things are hidden from it. This should be maintained; it is maintained by those who are spiritual. The travesty called Christendom is the result of disregard of this principle.
Ques. Would you say, perhaps, there are few Christians that understand it?
J.T. That may be; but the point for each one of us is to ask, Do I understand it? The apostle Paul says he had great combat for the Colossians, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as had not seen his face in the flesh, that they might understand the mystery of God.
In Proverbs 25 you find a remarkable statement: "These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men
{312}
of Hezekiah king of Judah transcribed. It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the glory of kings is to search out a thing" @Proverbs 25:1,2. Certain proverbs of Solomon had apparently been neglected, and this was one of the first that they copied.
The Lord says, after having spoken of the hidden treasure and the pearl, etc., "Have ye understood all these things?" They say unto Him, "Yea, Lord". He replies, "every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a man that is a householder", etc. The scribe is thus in accord with the instruction that runs through Matthew, and which stands in relation to houses. The Lord is seen teaching in houses throughout Matthew, and the man who learns what He is teaching becomes an householder, and he is a scribe. Now the word 'scribe' there is not accidental. It is an allusion to the value of writing. He has an understanding of the value of writing in the things of God.
Ques. What have you in mind?
J.T. Writing makes an *exact* man; there is nothing calls for more exactness than the things of God. There must be nothing slipshod about a true scribe. If you have put it down, you go over it with your eye, and you can see the defects, and correct them.
Rem. We read of Ezra that he was "a scribe of the words of the commandments of Jehovah, and of his statutes to Israel", @Ezra 7:11.
J.T. It shows that he was a true priest. He was versed in the law of God. You can rely on what Ezra writes, he being a scribe in the law of God; that required great accuracy. The Lord says, "Until the heaven and the earth pass away, one *iota* or one *tittle* shall in no wise pass from the law till all come to pass" @Matthew 5:18. You can thus see what accuracy was needed in writing. The Scriptures are a standing miracle! The more you look into them the more you are
{313}
impressed with their infinite accuracy, as conveying the thoughts of God.
Ques. And would you suggest that we cannot understand divine things, if we do not know the Scriptures?
J.T. We cannot. They are the repository of the 'new' things and the 'old' things. The scribe instructed unto the kingdom of heaven, being like a householder, brings out of his treasure the new and the old things.
{314}
SONSHIP
@Matthew 14:33; @Matthew 16:15 - 18; @Malachi 3:16 - 18
I am thinking at this time, dear brethren, about sonship, and how it appears in difficult days such as these in which our lot is cast; and so I have taken up these passages in Matthew that we may see how sonship is presented in this evangelist, as bearing on the assembly; that is, how it may bear in a collective way, how sons were together. And I may remark, here, that it is as sons that we shall be together in heaven. It is indeed involved in the hope of our calling. We have to understand *God's* calling, and we have to understand *our* calling; as we have to understand God's inheritance, and our inheritance. Our calling is involved in sonship, so that as sons we shall be together. Unless we learn the relationship now, we shall not cherish our calling, for it implies what we shall be. The wise man in Proverbs speaks of his desire rather "It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a contentious woman, and a house in common" @Proverbs 25:24. We have thus to learn how to discriminate in regard to living companions; how to dwell in a most inconvenient, uncomfortable place, physically, rather than to be in contentious companionship. The book of Proverbs bears on the assembly; and what I refer to is one of the maxims that may be put down by each of us as of first-rate importance. Christians, of all others, are intended to be very discriminating in the choice of living companions.
And so, in the epistle to the Ephesians, believers there are said to have loved locally and universally; they loved *all* the saints. We have to learn to love at a distance. The apostle Paul, for instance, speaks about his regard for certain who had not seen his face in the flesh. We are thus to have love for all saints;
{315}
then we are fit for translation. I do not say that we shall not be translated without it, but there is need of fitness. It says in Revelation 19, "his wife hath made herself ready" @Revelation 19:7. To have part in the bride involves that we have love to all the saints; for we are to be caught up *together*, we do not go up severally. We do indeed sometimes speak of certain having gone to heaven, which is not quite scriptural. When the time for going to heaven, according to the purpose of God, arrives, we shall all go up together. So that, in treating of the subject, the apostle says, "God, being rich in mercy, because of his great love wherewith he loved us, (we too being dead in offences,) has quickened us with the Christ, ... and has raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus" @Ephesians 2:4 - 6. "Together" has to be noted there, because it has reference to our regard for one another; that there shall be no such thing as quarrelling, or resentment, or discord, otherwise we are unfit, morally, for being translated. I do not say that anyone will be left out -- not one; but I am speaking of readiness, of that fitness that corresponds with the divine thought. So that if God raises us together, and sets us down together in the heavenlies in Christ, it is as those who love universally, who love all; and that is the apprehension of sonship. I love the saints in the light of their dignity, I love them in the light of their birth; for "every one that loves him that has begotten loves also him that is begotten of him" (@1 John 5:1); but I also love them in the light of their dignity, because they are "all God's sons", Scripture says, "by faith in Christ Jesus" (@Galatians 3:26); -- all!
I wish to speak of it in its bearing on the present time, as presented in Matthew; for Matthew deals with the assembly, as we all, I suppose, know; and what underlies it is sonship. It is only as I apprehend myself as a son that I can be rightly in the assembly. Matthew quotes the passage from Hosea 11, in
{316}
which God says, "When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son" @Hosea 11:1. These two thoughts are perfectly presented in Christ, in Matthew; the first has reference to youthful affection, and freshness; if applied to the saints it is seen in the epistle to the Thessalonians; saints recently converted, who had "turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God; and to await his Son from the heavens" @1 Thessalonians 1:9,10. They are addressed as "the assembly of Thessalonians in God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ" @1 Thessalonians 1:1. They were beloved of God. All this has reference to a company of saints in any locality; a local growth; the outcome of the gospel, in youthful vigour and freshness; they are "in God the Father" (@1 Thessalonians 1:1), and are "beloved by God" @1 Thessalonians 1:4.
The same applies to the Lord, so that, in Matthew, you find the "young child" mentioned eight times in the second chapter. The magi from the east found Him; "having come into the house they saw the little child with Mary his mother, and falling down did him homage. And having opened their treasures, they offered to him gifts, gold, and frankincense, and myrrh" @Matthew 2:11. He is marked off as revered by the Gentiles at the very outset. But I speak of Him according to what he is to God. There was infinite pleasure for God in that young Child. He was cast upon God from the very outset of His being here on earth. A marvellous thing! a fact that only could appear in a divine Person becoming incarnate. What delight was for God in that young Child! He was under divine protection. "Arise, take to thee the little child and his mother, and flee into Egypt" @Matthew 2:13. And then Matthew quotes the scripture, "that that might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son" @Matthew 2:15. So that Christ is presented in Matthew as a son, called out of Egypt. The whole history of Israel from the divine side was
{317}
taken up in Him; for the prophecy of Hosea referred, historically, to Israel as a child; alluding to the freshness of youth in them, as God saw them at the outset; the firstfruits of His increase. But then He says, "out of Egypt I called my son" @Hosea 11:1. The call has reference not to the Child, but to the Son; the *Son* is called out of Egypt. So that Matthew gives us what underlies the assembly from the beginning the idea of being called out; separated from the world. "Out of Egypt I called my son". I wonder if there is one here as truly a son as Paul, a true believer, and yet possibly in the world? your links, your friendships may be in the world. God would say to you tonight, "Out of Egypt I called my son". Your place is not there. The divine call to you is to come out of Egypt, for that is not your place. God has got a place for you; heaven is your place, as a son.
I wish now to show how this great relationship becomes apprehended; we can get the idea from the Lord only. First, I want to call attention to the passage I read from Matthew 14. The Lord had fed the multitude: about five thousand men, besides women and children; He had used the disciples in the service. It was divine bounty administered through them, indicative of what was in His mind, that His people were to be in His hand for such a service. And then, after this miracle, it says, "immediately he compelled the disciples to go on board ship, and to go on before him to the other side" @Matthew 14:22. He *compelled* them. You see it becomes a question of the will of the Lord. So I have no option at all; it is imperative. Let no one assume to have a free will. If the Lord reveals His will in regard to you, you have no option but to bow. To refuse to bow means that you are outside that realm in which He will display Himself; outside of that in which His sonship is witnessed. So His disciples, immediately
{318}
after their service that was so effective, are to go into a ship under His compulsion.
Now, I would say to any young man or woman here, that the Lord has made His will perfectly plain at the present time -- "This is the way, walk ye in it" (@Isaiah 30:21); and any one who refuses to bow to His will in that way simply shuts himself out of the sphere of light and privilege. You may say, The boat does not seem safe; or you may say, looking at the clouds, Possibly a storm will arise; you may say, Some of these people are not congenial to me; but those excuses and criticisms are only the evidence of the lawless will which underlies them. You are having to do with the Lord, to whom you are responsible; you must bow to His will whatever the apparent inconveniences.
Here the Lord compels the disciples to go into the boat so as to cross to the other side. There was no option; to refuse to go would be simply lawlessness; moreover, any who refused in this instance would miss most wonderful education, for it was those who were in the ship that rendered homage to Christ, and recognised Him as Son of God. If any had elected to stay at the other side, refusing to go for the reasons I have mentioned, they would have shut themselves out of all the light and instruction which the journey in the boat afforded.
First, the Lord sends the multitude away. *He* does that; and then He goes up to the mountain and prays. For whom is He praying? He is thinking of that ship; He is thinking of every one in it; it was under His command they entered into it; the responsibility of the voyage is His. We may count on Him to carry us through any course into which He directs us. Is the voyage safe? Yes, beloved friends, it is safe. He is on high in regard to it. And then, presently, in the fourth watch of the night, He is on the sea, and walks upon it, on the boisterous wave. Had they ever seen that before? Never, so far as
{319}
Scripture relates. The wind had risen, and the waves, and the ship was tossed. Christ walks on the waves! a marvellous thing. They thought it was an apparition. It was no apparition; it was a real Man, a Man whom they had learned to love; now they saw Him in a new way, they saw Him as the Son of God! They worshipped Him.
This is what I may call objective instruction; it is what you see in Christ; He is walking on the waves, but only those in the boat saw this and got the gain of it. I need not remark on what may have passed between them in that boat; mutterings, doubtless; complainings, doubtless; as the waves beat in upon them; but one man is affected by the sight of the Lord on the water; he says, "Lord, if it be thou, command me to come to thee *upon the waters*" @Matthew 14:28. He is seizing the idea -- the Son of God walking on the water. He is superior to the water -- to satanic power; and now another wishes to be superior to it also. Sonship is seen in this chapter. The Son of God is walking superior to the power of Satan, superior to the winds and waves, and another essays to join Him. Peter had the light, though he failed in faith; he learned the spiritual lesson fully afterwards. When the Lord had gone up into the ship, the wind fell, and now it says, "those in the ship came and did homage to him, saying, Truly thou art God's Son". They acquired in that position, as subject to Christ, a knowledge of Him they never had before, and they rendered homage to Him as Son of God. It is a definite point reached in the history of our souls when we apprehend Christ as superior to the powers of evil; the waves might seem to wreck the boat, but the Son of God is there; and the knowledge of the Son of God thus acquired, renders the believer superior to the waves and winds of Satan. We are of little use in the assembly unless we have learned this lesson.
{320}
What we have in chapter 16 is not what is objective, but what is in Peter by the Father's revelation. This needs nothing in the way of power outwardly. The Lord, in order to bring out what was there (He knew the revelation would come), *demanded* of them, saying, "Who do men say that I the Son of man am?" @Matthew 16:13. They answered Him that some said this, and some said that. They were not indifferent; they knew what men were saying about Christ. No one who loves Christ will be indifferent to what is said about Him. If Christ is well spoken of, he will be thankful, whoever the speaker may be; Satan is not prompting that. If a man speaks ill of Christ, Satan is behind that man, and I feel it. The Lord demanded of them, and they told Him; and then He says, What about yourselves? "Who do ye say that I am?" The result shows that He does not here refer to anything that had appeared publicly in His ministry. He knew what was there; something had taken place in one of His disciples, and He wants to bring that out.
We are dealing here with a wholly spiritual matter; it is not now a question of raising the dead, or stilling the winds and waves, or walking on the water; it is a question of *revelation*. How much do we know about this? The apostle Paul prays for us that we may have "the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him" @Ephesians 1:17. Paul says that God revealed His Son *in* him. It is a question of what happens inside the believer; it is a divine transaction within. Man affords a sphere in which the Holy Spirit operates directly to bring about results. The Father had wrought with Peter. "And Simon Peter answering said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God". How did he know? The Lord enlightens us on the point, He would emphasise it: "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens". It was the Father's
{321}
work. I am not seeking to *explain* it; it has to be known by direct relation with God; it is a spiritual matter. "Flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens". The Lord had waited for this; He knew it was there; He wanted to bring it out, hence He demanded from them; He put them to the test as to whether they knew who He was.
And you find that in the history of your soul; it is a question as to whether you are spiritual; it is not what you have seen objectively; not even what you have learned from the Scriptures, but whether you are spiritual in regard to Christ, whether you have come to know Him on the principle of revelation. So Peter says, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God". And the Lord says, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona". He says, "Thou art Peter". This is applicable to every stone in the building, really. It is a spiritual thing now; it is now what you are by virtue of the work of God in your soul; in confessing Him thus I apprehend Him in relation to God. I have the light of it in my soul; it is on the principle of revelation. "Thou art Peter" -- Peter is taken up in the light of his confession, and he is regarded abstractly as that now. On the confession of Peter, the Lord says, "On this rock I will build my assembly, and hades¬ gates shall not prevail against it". We have now the foundation and the material for a structure that is to be invulnerable; the hades gates shall not prevail against it; the "gates". It is not exactly a question of military power, but of counsel; the assembly which Christ builds is composed of persons of His own order. The "universal lords of this darkness" (@Ephesians 6:12) take counsel how they may circumvent the counsel of God, but they have no power against this of which I am speaking. It is a spiritual formation -- composed of those who apprehend Christ as the Son of the living God. Peter
{322}
represents those who are stones in this wonderful building. It is formed of persons; they are spiritual as of Christ, apprehending Him as the Son of the living God.
In chapter 17 we see how little this was apprehended. This chapter shows how slow the disciples were. At Capernaum those who collected tribute money said to Peter, "Does your teacher not pay the didrachmas?" @Matthew 17:24. He is put to the test; and we are put to the test also it is for us; we shall be tested as we proceed in the school of God. Well, what have you learned, Peter? Peter says, Certainly my Master pays tribute; he had missed the mark entirely; not that the light was not there, but it was not operative. You see, it was not ready to hand when the question was put to him, "Does your teacher not pay the didrachmas?" If it had been ready to hand he would have said, My Master is the Son of God; my Master is a divine Person; my Master is greater than the temple. That is what Peter should have said had he followed the revelation he had; but he did not follow it; hence when he was tested he broke down. Now the Lord would set him right, and He would set us all right tonight. The Lord deals with this matter in the house. When Peter comes into the house the Lord anticipates him, and He says, "What dost thou think, Simon? the kings of the earth, from whom do they receive custom or tribute? from their own sons or from strangers? Peter says to him, From strangers. Jesus said to him, Then are the sons free" @Matthew 17:25,26.
Some of us are better versed in the manner of the kings of this world, and in the etiquette of this world, than we are versed in the truth of the house of God, and we are not ashamed of it! We should be ashamed if it were a matter of ordinary education that had been neglected; and yet of things spiritual that we are ignorant of, we are not ashamed! When the Person of Christ is attacked all around us, it
{323}
behoves us to have ready material to meet it; that is to say, the knowledge of the Son of God. Peter had been up on the mount with Christ, and he had heard the voice out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight: hear him" (@Matthew 17:5), but he seemed to have forgotten it. When he is faced with this question he says, Yes, He pays tribute; he was not ready to meet the question.
Now the Lord would make him ready; He is patient with us; when He questioned him about the kings of the earth, Peter answered aright, and then the Lord says, The sons are free; the sons! What Peter needs to know is that now he is one of the sons himself. For it is as one of the sons that you are able to answer correctly when questions are raised about Christ. "Then are the sons free". What a word for us! The Lord graciously allies us with Himself in these remarkable words. Think of brethren holding themselves aloof from that -- the relationship of sons! And now the Lord says, "But that we may not be an offence to them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up, and when thou hast opened its mouth thou wilt find a stater; take that and give it to them for me and thee" @Matthew 17:27. So we are linked up eternally with Christ, as sons.
I wish now to show briefly in closing, from Malachi, how all this fits into a day of small things. Matthew 18 treats of the assembly; that is to say, it treats of the spirit in which we regard and deal with one another as in the assembly of God. The Lord speaks of the assembly as the final court of appeal: "If thy brother sin against thee, go, reprove him between thee and him alone ... if he do not hear thee, take with thee one or two besides ... But if he will not listen to them, tell it to the assembly; and if also he will not listen to the assembly, let him be to thee as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer" @Matthew 18:15 - 17. The man that refuses to hear the assembly is treated
{324}
as unfit for fellowship. "Let him be to thee as one of the nations and a tax-gatherer". Such is the greatness of the assembly, and such the solemnity of refusing to hear it. But then He says, "If two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter, whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens" @Matthew 18:19. And then He goes on to say, "For where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them" @Matthew 18:20, That is to say, in these last words He makes provision for a day of small things; He speaks of "two", and then of "two or three".
Now I want to show that this great principle of sonship works out in a collective way in a day of small things. In Malachi we have reference, in a general way, to God and His servants; in chapter 3 we read, "Since the days of your fathers have ye departed from my statutes, and have not kept them" @Malachi 3:7. Then in verse 13, "Your words have been stout against me, saith Jehovah; but ye say, What have we been speaking against thee? Ye say, It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we keep his charge, and that we walk mournfully before Jehovah of hosts" @Malachi 3:13. That is to say, they are disregarding the service of God; for them there is no profit in it. It is a dreadful state of things that Malachi depicts. And, mark you, he is dealing, not with the mass of Israel, but with the returned remnant. Decay had set in even in these; God's word was disregarded, and His service disregarded; there was no profit in it. One looks abroad now in nominal Christendom, and sees the difficulty they experience to keep things going; spirituality is waning, dying out; men who will serve God are scarce.
Now, in the presence of all this, "Then they that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another; and Jehovah observed it". This has often been spoken
{325}
of; it is a well-known Passage. I quote it for one purpose; it refers to a saint that serves. It is a day of small things, as I have said; it is a question of those that fear the Lord. Now, if we go back to the book of Proverbs, which is an assembly book, we read, "The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom" @Proverbs 9:10. So in speaking "one to another", wisdom has its place, and assembly conditions come into view -- tabernacle conditions -- wisdom is seen in the building of the tabernacle, and in the building of the temple, and it comes into action amongst those who fear the Lord.
So John says, "He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me; but he that loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will manifest myself to him" @John 14:21. That fits in here amongst those who fear the Lord; they get manifestations of Christ. This involves a pattern; He presents Himself by manifestation, so that we should see what should be. Judas (not Iscariot) says, "Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not to the world?" @John 14:22. And the Lord replies, "If any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him" @John 14:23. I have spoken of the fear of the Lord being the beginning of wisdom; the connection now is His *word*. I not only regard His commandments, but I have got His word, and I keep it. What does that mean? It means the wisdom of God that the epistles to the Corinthians, Colossians and Ephesians have opened up. Hence I arrive at tabernacle conditions in a day of small things, amongst those that fear the Lord. And so the Lord says that He and the Father will come, and make their abode with him.
Think of that, dear brethren! We have tabernacle conditions in spite of the smallness of things. And then He says, "I will spare them as a man spareth
{326}
his own son that serveth him". His own son! Now contemplate that. The term is applied peculiarly to Christ. You will find that Scripture never errs in the use of words; the more you look into Scripture, the more value you set on the words. In Romans 8 we have it that God did not spare His *own* Son. How that touches the heart! He "has not spared his own Son, but delivered him up for us all" @Romans 8:32. But now He says, He spares those who fear Him and speak often one to another, "as a man spareth his own son that serveth him". You see what importance God attaches to true service as found amongst those who fear Him, and speak of Him one to the other. You see what God values: the son who serves Him.
Now, perhaps some of you will have noticed that in this last book in the Old Testament, the people of God are enjoined to keep the law of Moses given at Horeb for all Israel. You can understand that. It appears in the last chapter of Malachi. It was no question of what was given for the remnant merely; it was given for *all Israel*. That is to say, the whole scope of revelation is for us. The law is kept by *sons*. In Romans we read that "as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God" (@Romans 8:14), and that we "have not received a spirit of bondage again for fear" (@Romans 8:15), but the "Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father" @Romans 8:15. Of old Israel was regarded as a son: "Let my son go, that he may serve me" (@Exodus 4:23), God said to Pharaoh. This service is now found in those who are led by the Spirit of God. I would say to all that God deals tenderly with us. He did not spare His own Son; He gave *Him* up for us; but He spares "sons". As the Lord says, "I do not cast upon you any other burden" @Revelation 2:24. It is in the light of our serving Him as sons.
May it be our portion, dear brethren, in a day such as our own, to serve God as His own sons, while He spares us!
{327}
THE GATES OF ZION
@Psalm 87:2; @1 Samuel 30:22 - 25; @2 Samuel 1:11,12; @2 Samuel 5:6 - 10; @2 Samuel 6:12 - 14; @2 Samuel 6:17 - 19
I have in mind to dwell on "the gates of Zion" tonight, as representing the nature of God as it works out amongst His people, in the way of bountiful service or administration; for "God", it says, "loves a cheerful giver" (@2 Corinthians 9:7); and it is this cheerful giving, particularly in a spiritual sense, that characterises "the gates of Zion".
In order to bring this out, I wish to show, from the scriptures read in the books of Samuel, how the divine nature, from this point of view, enters into Zion. I may say at once that I speak of Zion from the standpoint of the hearts of God's people. God has taken possession of our hearts, as in Romans, by shedding abroad His love in them by His Spirit. That is an initial movement on God's part -- what He goes back to later in order to develop His purpose in the hearts of His people, His great administrative thought. His love being there holding the ground by the Spirit, He takes them up in relation to His sovereignty, our hearts thus becoming of immense importance; they are the sphere in which God operates first for our deliverance, and then for the setting out of what He is. And in order that He should be fully set out thus, according to His sovereign purpose and love, He links us up with heaven, so that we are regarded as "the assembly of the firstborn who are registered in heaven" @Hebrews 12:23.
Having said that, I want to show, in David, how Christ operates. I speak of him for the moment as a type of Christ. In the two books of Samuel we have a life-size picture of David. The history is not so
{328}
full in Chronicles; there he is viewed in connection with the temple, looking on to the coming day. Whereas in Samuel it is the person of David -- not so much the official David as the personal David. In order to understand the official position of Christ, we have to understand Him personally. So David is said to be a man after God's *heart*. This is the great problem to be worked out. It begins with the heart of God. We are dealing with hearts. Saul was the choice of the people; David was God's choice. God remarked, in making His choice, that He looked not on the outward appearance, but on the heart. And as David is anointed, we have his name for the first time in Samuel, meaning 'beloved'; indicating at the very outset that that man had found a place in His heart.
I need not enlarge on that, beloved friends, in regard to Christ; how John presents Him as becoming flesh, and dwelling "among us"; he says, "we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father" @John 1:14. He saw Him in relation to the Father. And again He says, "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared him" @John 1:18. He is in the bosom of the Father! That is to say, Christ is in the heart of God. He was loved before the foundation of the world, it says (@John 17:24); but John alludes to Him as become flesh, and that He is in the bosom of the Father. Thus the whole problem to be worked out in hearts begins in the heart of God. The One who declares God is in His bosom. At His baptism we have the announcement from heaven, "Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight" @Mark 1:11. It is as if God had been looking for it, and now He has found it in Him. Again on the mount of Transfiguration the announcement is made, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight: hear him" @Matthew 17:5. God thus shows the kind of Man that had found a
{329}
place in His heart. He was attractive to God -- infinitely so! Ever so, of course, in His divine Person, but now as become Man.
Now, the next thing to consider is, How is God to get into man's heart? for that is what He has in mind. His desire is wondrous! He approaches men in the same blessed attractive Person as had found a place in *His* bosom: the One who was delightful to God! Now you will find in regard to David, that whilst God did not look on the externals, but on the heart, the Holy Spirit gives us the externals in 1 Samuel 16, "he was ruddy, and besides of a lovely countenance and beautiful appearance" @1 Samuel 16:12. Samuel had said to Jesse, "Send and fetch him; for we will not sit at table till he come hither" @1 Samuel 16:11. And as he arrived, the Holy Spirit gives the picture: "He was ruddy", that is to say, full of life, "and besides of a lovely countenance and beautiful appearance" @1 Samuel 16:12. From an external point of view he was to be attractive to men; and as attractive to them he was to find a way into their hearts, so as to have a place there. And he did.
But not only was he so to the external appearance, he was beautiful in moral qualifications. Saul needs a man to stand before him to play on the harp, and one of his young men describes David. It is not now a description, as in the earlier part of the chapter, it is a description given by the Spirit from the lips of a young man. It is indeed delightful to think of a young man describing the beauty and attractiveness, in a moral sense, of Christ in David. He says to Saul, He is "skilled in playing" @1 Samuel 16:18. That is to say, not only is he beautiful to look upon, but he has got the power of *entertaining*. How the world bids for young people to entertain them! The placards in every city call attention to the power of entertaining that is in the world. Did you ever think of the power that Christ had to entertain?
{330}
And then he says, "he is a valiant man and a man of war" @1 Samuel 16:18. Not only can he entertain, but if it be a question of truth, or a question of doctrine, or a question of principle, he is valiant, he turns not aside for any. He is a man who knows the art of war. And moreover he is skilled in speech; he can speak and command the intelligence of the people of God. "Never man spoke thus, as this man speaks" (@John 7:46) was said of Christ. He spoke with authority, and not as the scribes; He was skilful in speech.
And then he was "of good presence" @1 Samuel 16:18. It is not now exactly that he was beautiful to look upon, but there was power in his presence. Some of us here know what the presence of the Lord is; there is power and blessing in it. How the littleness of the natural mind would be hushed, completely silenced, in that presence as He appeared to them after His resurrection! He was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve, and later on He was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; He was seen of James, and last of all He was seen of Paul. What a presence! what blessed influence in that presence! And it was so as He was here in humiliation; no one could be near the Lord with any kind of exercise without being impressed with His marvellous presence; even a Pilate, sitting upon his judgment seat. Think of the dignity with which He appeared before Pilate, and the high priest, and Herod! In their inmost hearts they must have felt the superiority of that presence.
And then, finally, it says of David that the Lord was with him. These traits of Christ are depicted for us here, that He should find a way into men's hearts. He has been doing it all these centuries, He has been wondrously effectual in entering into men's hearts; He would use them through their hearts, through their intelligence, through their affection; He would have us wholly, and for the most exalted service conceivable -- to form Zion; that which had its roots
{331}
away back in eternity, before the world was; that which God intended to set up in His people -- His own nature, His own wisdom. Is it not attractive?
David would take the stronghold of Zion, and as he is owned by all Israel, he goes to Jerusalem. He had already brought the head of the giant there, you will remember, after he had slain him -- a testimony to his warrior power. The head was there; that is to say, he had annulled him that had the might of death. By dying Christ would free us, to have us, to use us in this exalted service. He destroyed "him who has the might of death" (@Hebrews 2:14) in order to set at liberty all those who "through fear of death through the whole of their life were subject to bondage" @Hebrews 2:15. And now, in due course, as anointed by all Israel, David goes to Zion, and he takes the city. The Jebusites are called "the inhabitants of the land"; not merely the inhabitants of that city, they were the inhabitants of *the land*. They represent the power of Satan through his emissaries controlling men's hearts, "the spirit who now works" (the ruler of the authority of the air) "in the sons of disobedience" @Ephesians 2:2. We have all been under that influence; but the Lord has taken Zion. David comes up to the city, and they ridicule him; they ask him can he overcome the lame and the blind? thinking David could not come in there. But David, it says, took the stronghold of Zion. There is nothing said here about Joab. We have here the type of Christ taking possession of His Zion in His own might, in His own attractiveness. Joab is mentioned in 1 Chronicles 11, where it is said that he repaired the city. The city has reference to the future, but what we have here is the stronghold of Zion which David takes; and as taking it, names it as the "city of David".
How every true lover of Christ recognises his part, as it were, in that city! It is not simply what has come down to Him by way of heritage, He has
{332}
acquired it by His own prowess; we have yielded it up to Him. "So David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from the Millo and inward". I am dwelling on this, beloved brethren, so that you may understand the importance of "the gates of Zion". The building is inward. If I may introduce here, what I am entitled to do, the whole gospel of John treats generally of the *inward* operations of Christ. You will find in all those who follow Christ and recognise Him, in John, that the trend is inward and upward; leading to a heavenly position spiritually. The saints are brought to it gradually, so that, in the last chapter, the doors are shut. It is not an outward movement in that chapter; the disciples were in a private place, and the doors were shut; their service was inward and upward. The message had been sent to them by the Lord, "I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God" @John 20:17.
Well, David built inward. I want now to show you certain principles that he carried in there. In 1 Samuel 30 we have, I think, his first statute. A statute is a fixed principle; a principle not to be repealed. I mean from a spiritual standpoint. I just dwell briefly on the circumstances of this, so that we may understand what entered into Zion in David. For all these things are carried forward, and accumulated by David in the city of Zion. Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God and it is for us to find these glorious things. They are spoken.
Now you find that, after the great victory recorded in 1 Samuel 30, David returned to the two hundred that had remained behind, who could not go on with him. It was not that they would not go, they could not go. It was not for want of will. There are those who will not go after David, and there are those who would go, but cannot. There is a very great difference between the two. David came to them, and he
{333}
saluted them. We are now in the presence of Christ. What magnanimity! And there was tender consideration for weakness, which always marks the priest. They had not been able to cross the brook Besor -- the word is really 'torrent' -- they could not go over the torrent Besor; meaning that it was difficult to pass over; it was an obstacle over which they could not pass on account of weakness, not on account of will. God will not brook our wills; He has no interest whatever in the wills of His people, save to break them; but He is sympathetic with our weaknesses; He will bear with us, and will show that they in no wise disqualify us from sharing the fruits of the victory. David salutes them as he comes near.
But now come out wicked men and men of Belial; they resented this; listen to their speech: "Because they went not with us, we will not give them aught of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart" -- they have accomplished nothing, they did not go to the battle; let them take their wives and children, and be gone! The Holy Spirit calls them "sons of Belial"; the Holy Spirit calls them by that name! David did not. Why are they "sons of Belial"? Because they would not recognise and bear with the weakness of their brethren, and because they would shut them out. Listen again to what they say, "Let them take their wives and children, and depart". Think of that! Think of the callousness manifested! They are ready to surrender two hundred brethren on account of these brethren's weakness. "Let them depart" -- without food, or anything else -- let them take their wives and children, and go! Where is the love of God in them? Not an atom of it. Then David speaks; he says, "Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which Jehovah has given us". He calls them "brethren"! We are now on the side of grace. It is a picture of
{334}
the grace of God overcoming evil -- the spirit of Christ shown in consideration of weakness.
And so David makes it a statute in Israel: "as his share is that goes down to the battle, so shall his share be that abides by the baggage: they shall share alike". Mark you, he dignifies them; he does not call them weak ones, though that is what they were; he credits them with abiding by the stuff. And so it may be with fathers having something in their care, or mothers looking after little ones -- whatever is legitimate -- so the word applies if they cannot go. But, if any could go, and would not -- that makes a very great difference. God knows which. Whatever the spoil -- and there is spoil where the people of God are moving on by the Spirit -- whatever the spoil, you get your share; and the Scripture says the statute remains unto this day; whatever the date of the writing of the book, that statute was recognised by the Spirit of God; it remained; I hope it does with us!
Well, the next great principle is in 2 Samuel 1, and it is in keeping with this. What you will observe is that David is at Ziklag; that is to say, he is in the sphere where this statute was formulated, and he is going to add to it; he is building up a code of principles, involving a right spirit; a spirit cultivated by the epistle to the Romans, and other epistles, a spirit by which we overcome evil with good. That is the spirit. And so David was at Ziklag; and on the third day a messenger comes to him, thinking that he was bringing good news for him, that is to say, good news for the flesh. (The flesh is always at cross purposes with the Spirit, however amiable and philanthropic it may be.) David, the spiritual man, said to him, "Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped. And David said to him, What has taken place? I pray thee, tell me" @2 Samuel 1:3,4. And then the messenger
{335}
rehearsed the news of Saul and Jonathan being slain; as much as to say, It will be good news for you; your way now opens up to the throne! But what does David do? He "took hold of his garments and rent them; and all the men that were with him did likewise. And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Jehovah, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword". It was a mournful day; it was not a day of exultation, it was a day of sorrow! We cannot afford to regard our brethren, however opposed, if they are lost to us, without sorrow.
Now that is what David sets up here. He sets an example. His enemy, bitter to the last degree, was slain, but David is above that; he is not thinking of the malice of Saul; he is thinking of God. How this bears him above the malice of the flesh! He recites his feelings, they were from his heart. Saul and Jonathan! he grieved for them. Saul was anointed with oil, and he could not but respect him; and so, beloved brethren, we must respect the Spirit by which our brethren have been anointed as with oil; whatever their attitude towards us, the grace of God enables us to regard whatever is of God in them. David wept, and he rent his garments.
Now you will see how all this is added to what we dwelt on in speaking of 1 Samuel 30; and thus we have what is a sure guard against resentment or jealousy. The believer in the light of David is superior to it; he has always the victory, he is always overcoming evil with good.
Now I wish to carry all this forward to chapter 6. David now becomes, not exactly a type of Christ, but a type of the believer. He sees the ark now; and the ark, as it were, supersedes him. It is a question of spiritual apprehension. The ark was in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months, and the Lord blessed Obed-edom, and all his household; and
{336}
David would share in this blessing. Wherever Christ is entertained, God's blessing is sure to be. And although we may have these wonderful principles of which we have been speaking, they of themselves do not make up Zion. You cannot have Zion fully without Christ. So that now it is a question of bringing the ark into the city of David, that is to say, a position acquired by the mighty prowess of Christ. And "when they that bore the ark of Jehovah had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatted beast", as if to say, I am coming near now to the most spiritual conception -- Christ in Zion. He says in effect, 'There must be no stumbling now'. It was true that the oxen had stumbled in the cart (it was a Philistine idea), but there must be no stumbling now. Stumbling is possible even with the most spiritual, as you see with David; but he had learned his lesson. It is now a question of carefulness. Of all the creatures of God, I suppose the steadiest tread is that of the ox. David, we are told, offered oxen and fatlings here. As we draw near to Christ with spiritual conception, surely it behoves us to tread carefully, to choose our steps, so that there may be no stumbling, no mis-steps taken.
After those who carried the ark of the Lord had gone six paces, David sacrificed. This alludes, I apprehend, to what goes beyond our ordinary exercises, the exercises of a man in his conscious weakness; this goes beyond that, and prepares for something else. In this instance, there must be much preparation if we are to enter into the apprehension of Christ in Zion. It is a wholly spiritual thought -- "six". I apprehend, would mean, "When I am weak, then I am powerful" @2 Corinthians 12:10. "Most gladly therefore will I rather boast in my weaknesses, that the power of the Christ may dwell upon me" @2 Corinthians 12:9. The power of Christ is the *six* paces, as I understand it. It is a question of power. We need power, as the apostle says, "For this reason I
{337}
bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ... that he may give you according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man; that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts, being rooted and founded in love, in order that ye may be fully able to apprehend" @Ephesians 3:14 - 18. We need strength for that. It is a question of spiritual ability to apprehend Christ. That Christ should dwell in your hearts by faith, is a marvellous proposition. So you see that after the six paces, David prepared for following on; he offers the oxen and the fatlings; and then he dances. He was exercised that there should be no slip; that every movement of his after the ark should be spiritual, should be governed by his intelligence. As the apostle says, "I will sing with the spirit, but I will sing also with the understanding" (@1 Corinthians 14:15). And again, "I will pray with the spirit, but I will pray also with the understanding" @1 Corinthians 14:15. Every movement is right as controlled by spiritual motives and intelligence. And so David dances with all his might.
What comes out in this is the spirituality of the man, and how there is no reserve. When you are reserving anything from God you are in very bad company -- in the company of Ananias and Sapphira. I do not say I am as bad as they were, but that is the company I am in, if I am reserving anything from God.
David dances with all his might, and, as an additional safeguard, he was girded with a linen ephod. The ephod is a priestly garment, *par excellence*. He was girded with a *linen* one; it denoted sobriety. Linen has the effect of reducing the heat, in contrast to wool. He says virtually, If I dance with all my might, I am not without sobriety. As Paul said, "I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but utter words of truth and soberness" @Acts 26:25. He was not a bit affected by natural sentiment, as he wished that
{338}
king Agrippa and all the rest should be as he was, except his bonds. So David danced with all his might, girded with a linen ephod.
One might say much about poor Michal, but that is not what I have before me. She despised David. You see nature is hopeless in these matters. Your nearest according to the flesh may become your greatest enemy when you are on spiritual lines.
Now I want just to finish with David's administrative bounty; because these acts are cumulative. "They brought in the ark of Jehovah, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had spread for it. And David offered up burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Jehovah". The ark is now set in relation to the purpose of God; and David now deals out to all Israel, "both men and women". Mark the individualising of the passage -- to every person in Israel; and then, to both men and women! We can understand it spiritually; the Lord knows each of us by name. But here is a question of the bounty that marks the gates of Zion; he deals out to every man and woman in Israel "a cake of bread, and a measure of wine, and a raisin-cake". Besides that, he blesses all the people; he is now again representative of God; a type of Christ. The present time is a dispensation of blessing, and if we are blessed, we are to be a blessing, so that instead of cursing we are blessing. That is "the gates of Zion". God loves that. He loves it above all the habitations of Jacob.
Well, dear brethren, that is what is set out before us, and it is workable at the present time. God loves it now. He brings the idea down to one person; He "loves a cheerful giver" @2 Corinthians 9:7. But "the gates" is the collective thought; it is a question of what the saints are, collectively, with Christ in their hearts; Christ known in the assembly as Head of it, as enshrined in it, as blessing it; so that what He is shines out in
{339}
our relations with one another, and with all men. The second letter to the Corinthians points it out in regard to material things. But I am not thinking of that just now, I am thinking of higher things; the wealth, the unsearchable riches of Christ, which are to be administered at the present time from the gates of Zion.
May God bless His word!
{340}
THE CHRISTIAN DISPENSATION MARKED BY MANHOOD
@Luke 23:34; @Luke 23:39 - 41; @Luke 23:47; @Ezekiel 47:6,7; @Ezekiel 47:12
In reading these scriptures I have in mind to speak about the present dispensation, and to bring out its salient features, especially at the beginning. It was inaugurated in suffering, it was perpetuated in suffering as at the outset, and if it is to end as it began, it must be maintained in the same way, that is, in suffering -- in those who *accept* suffering, as it is said in 2 Timothy 1, "but suffer evil along with the glad tidings, according to the power of God" @2 Timothy 1:8. Indeed, what we are called upon to follow in that epistle, namely, "righteousness, faith, love, peace" (@2 Timothy 2:22), taken as a whole, implies the maintenance of the dispensation according to that which marked it at the beginning.
You will observe that righteousness is placed first, the other things follow; and I would like to show, by the Lord's help, that Luke emphasises that feature in presenting to us the sufferings of Christ; and in presenting it he brings out the great moral supremacy over the sufferings of Christ as man. Luke alone presents to us this petition of Christ to His Father on the cross; "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do". He alone, too, presents the recognition of His righteousness, first by the thief, and then by the centurion. None of the other evangelists speak of the conversion of the thief, nor do any of them put on record the centurion's estimate of Christ as a righteous man, so we can readily see that Luke by the Holy Spirit is concerned about righteousness in thus presenting Christ. He is also emphasising the moral greatness of Christ as man; when the women of Jerusalem bewailed Him,
{341}
Luke records that He said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep over me, but weep over yourselves and over your children" (@Luke 23:28); that was Christ rising infinitely above all the sufferings occasioned by His testimony here.
Matthew and Mark put the centurion's comment on record as saying, "Truly this man was *Son of God*" (@Matthew 27:54, @Mark 15:39), for surely His sonship shone out in the power of His voice in that solemn moment, as we read, "Jesus, having again cried with a *loud* voice" (@Matthew 27:50), indicating that He was indeed the Son of God; and this necessarily enters into the dispensation, for He is "marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead" @Romans 1:4. Sonship is recognised by the centurion in the power that belongs to that Person, and he exclaims, "Truly this man was the Son of God" @Matthew 27:54. Luke, however, says of the centurion that when he saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, "In very deed this man was *just*".
I want to dwell upon the greatness of Christ in asking forgiveness for His murderers, and to show from Ezekiel how the present dispensation, viewed in fructifying life and power, was marked by *men*. You will observe that the "trees" are represented as growing on the one side and on the other side on the bank of the river. I hope to show from Acts how these trees may be taken to symbolise *men*. Trees in Scripture are types of men standing out in individual prominence, and Scripture warrants the use of the type, as for instance, the tree of life, which refers to Christ. Then the Lord Himself is elsewhere symbolised by a tree -- "He shall grow up before him as a tender sapling" (@Isaiah 53:2): again, in Matthew 15, "Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up" @Matthew 15:13. These scriptures show that trees are employed as symbols of men standing out, as I have said, in individual prominence. In our chapter the
{342}
trees are viewed as on the banks of the mighty stream of spiritual power and grace which marks this dispensation. It began with suffering, for you will remember how, according to the chapter in Ezekiel, the river flows down from under the right side of the house, at the south side of the *altar*, thus alluding to the atoning *sufferings* of Christ.
The prophet was turned round to view the gates, particularly the gate northward, and the gate that looked eastward, "and behold, waters ran out on the right side" @Ezekiel 47:2. He was led that way in order to be impressed with the judgment of God on the one hand, and with the favour of God on the other, for the river flowed from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar, the one indicating the favour of God, and the other the righteousness of God. These features appear at the *source*, so we see in Luke how the Lord in that solemn hour, as He was crucified, evidenced the former feature -- the favour of God: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do"; forgiveness was in His heart in spite of their murderous attitude; He asks that God would be favourable toward them. It is in the light of this marvellous request of Christ that the thief is converted. The character of the dispensation is disclosed in this wonderful request of Christ, and it was evidently made in the hearing of the thief. "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do".
What words to fall on the ears of a thief! He had not done what the murderers of Christ were doing; they were worse than thieves, they were murderers, but his opportunity arises when his fellow-thief attacks the Lord. Such is the depravity of the human heart, that even as experiencing such suffering, he would attack the Lord; but the converted thief reproves his companion, saying, "we indeed justly; for we receive the just recompense of what we have done; but this man has done *nothing amiss*". The work of God in
{343}
a man's soul must be ever in accord with the divine light presented to him, so you see how the work of God in the soul of this man brought him into accord with what was there in Christ; he thus becomes righteous; he is righteous in judging himself: "we indeed justly", he says, "but this man has done nothing amiss". The Lord is recognised at the outset of the dispensation as a righteous Man. And so it was also with the centurion, he heard the Lord crying with a loud voice, and having seen what was done, said, "In very deed this man was just".
Then God takes the issue between Christ and the world and the decision into His own hand, for God is far more concerned about righteousness than we are disposed to think: "Having come, he" (that is, the Spirit) "will bring demonstration to the world, of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment" @John 16:8. God will not leave it to the decision of the thief and the centurion, but will Himself vindicate His Son, so when the Holy Spirit came from heaven, He brought demonstration to the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment. What was the sin? "because they do not believe on me" (@John 16:9); and the demonstration of it was brought to the very streets of Jerusalem. The Holy Spirit came to the followers of Christ; it was to them that God gave His Spirit, not to the Jews. The Spirit of God tells us that they were all together in one place, and "there appeared to them parted tongues, as of fire, and it *sat* upon each one of them" (@Acts 2:3), showing how the Holy Spirit could discriminate; there was a moral reason, for He did not sit on any one who did not believe. He thus brought in demonstration that the Jews were guilty because they did not believe on Christ, but He also brought in demonstration of righteousness. The thief and the centurion both witnessed to righteousness in Christ; but God witnessed to it also, for Christ's position in heaven is witnessed to on the ground of
{344}
righteousness. God would have the world to know it, and He sent the demonstration of it in the Spirit. Righteousness is morally the greatest thing, and the Lord is said to have *loved* it: "Thou hast loved righteousness and hast hated lawlessness; therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee with oil of gladness above thy companions" @Hebrews 1:9. Such is God's estimate of, and delight in those who have it and practise it, that He would send demonstration of it into the world -- righteousness as expressed in His beloved Son.
The river flows out from beneath the altar -- the witness of righteousness, and in Ezekiel 47:6 we have the simple statement that the trees were on the bank of the river, not that they *grew* there. I have no doubt the allusion is to the apostles; they were there, whereas verse 12 refers to trees that *grew* upon the bank, and that is where *we* come in. None of us come in on apostolic ground, and whatever men came in after the apostles are growths, the results of the fructifying life and power of this mighty stream of the Holy Spirit; and the fact that He continues here is a guarantee for the production of such men. You will remember how the apostle Paul urges upon the Corinthians to be men; "Brethren, be not children in your minds, but in malice be babes; but in your minds be grown men" @1 Corinthians 14:20. If you wish to know the cause of the scarcity of men in that sense, you may consult that letter of Paul's to the Corinthians; you will find that they were not concerned as to what is spiritual, they were carnal, babes, and in that sense did not exhibit a testimony to the power of the dispensation.
But I want to show now from the Acts what I conceive to be antitypes of these trees. I refer first to Peter and John, for after @Acts 2 attention is directed to individuals. In chapter 2 we read that every day the Lord had brought in additions, such
{345}
as should be saved, but now beginning at chapter 3, attention is called to individuals who stand out in distinction -- men -- grown men in their minds. In Ephesians we have the full divine thought as to men; "until we all arrive at the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at the full-grown man" (@Ephesians 4:13); the end in view in all ministry is that the saints should be no longer babes, but full-grown men.
I touch now on Peter and John, who are singled out. You will remember that when the Lord found Peter he was with Andrew his brother, and when He found John he was in the company of his brother James, but now the Lord takes them out of their natural settings, out of what might hold them naturally. It is important to recognise the sovereignty of the Lord in His choice of His people and in His setting them together. Peter and John are presented as a lovely picture of two brothers in the spiritual sense, taken out of their natural settings -- Peter taken from Andrew, and John taken from James -- and then set together spiritually, and they are truly together. If you were to analyse the influences which draw saints together in any special way, you would be surprised to find how much of the natural there is, but these men are taken out of their natural settings and are truly set together in a spiritual way. It is a great thing to find "two of you" (@Matthew 18:19) at the present time -- not two persons in the flesh, not two relatives, not two with the same dispositions naturally, but "two of you" -- two of the assembly. The assembly is a spiritual conception in Matthew, and the materials are the result of the Father's revelation. Peter and John were two who were set together spiritually, and they are found going up together to the temple at the hour of prayer. What a spectacle for heaven to look upon! It was at the ninth hour -- the hour of prayer. Not many weeks before this the Lord Jesus had died at that very hour,
{346}
and no doubt their thoughts would be going back to *that* event, and they are found united spiritually as they went up to the temple at the time of the day in which it occurred. I would put it to you to consider the value of prayer under such conditions: "If two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter, whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is in the heavens" @Matthew 18:19. Mark what it says, "It shall come to *them*", and God will see that it does come to them.
I pass on now to the next example of manhood -- another of the trees, so to speak, growing on the banks of this great river of grace and power, namely, Barnabas. He is a *prince*, according to God, and being possessed of land, having sold it, he brought the money and laid it at the feet of the apostles. He is spoken of in the end of @Acts 4 as coming forward in a princely way; he is not mean or small. Sometimes there are those who have no means spiritually, but the book of Deuteronomy provides for such; the poor brother should be taken care of bountifully. No demand is made upon Barnabas; he simply came forward, as of old the princes of Israel came forward, each prince upon his day, and for twelve days the wonderful procedure detailed in @Numbers 7 went on, until the twelve great men of Israel had each made his offering. The Holy Spirit spreads it all out before us in that long chapter of eighty-nine verses, so that we might get some idea of what a prince really is. Princes are men of spiritual means -- not petty men, and they look at things from the divine side; and so Barnabas is named "son of consolation" (@Acts 4:36); he becomes a great binding influence between Jerusalem and the work of God at Antioch. He had the confidence of his brethren and so was sent down by the assembly in Jerusalem to Antioch as fitted to meet the need there. "He was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith" @Acts 11:24.
{347}
Then we come to Stephen; he is a witness to another feature of manhood -- his face shone as the face of an angel. There was in him a reflection of what is in heaven. He had no definite appointment save that he was a deacon, but as such he had purchased to himself "a good degree, and much boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus" @1 Timothy 3:14. Stephen represents what is within our reach on the line of exercise; it is not a question of appointment; it is a great result reached through devotedness; he becomes a marvellous witness, one who boldly faces the enemies of Christ, and brings in demonstration by the power of the Spirit as to their guilt. He is a great servant, and a martyr. We are of little account unless we are prepared for martyrdom, and Stephen represents manhood which shows itself in martyrdom -- a man who can stand up for the truth before the fiercest opposition and suffer for it.
The next one we come to is Philip -- another example of most remarkable development in service. The need for servants at the present time is very great; the Lord said to His disciples, "The harvest is great, and the workmen are few; supplicate therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth workmen unto his harvest" @Matthew 9:37,38. Philip represents a true servant; he went down to Samaria. Had he been governed by national feeling he would have avoided Samaria, for it was a rival of Jerusalem. He preached Christ there. We have no mention that any special gift for preaching had been given to him before this. You may say, 'I have no gift for preaching', but how can you know you have no gift, if you have not even tried to preach? We read that there was great joy in that city; he had preached Christ unto them; one of the best marks in a preacher is that he preaches *Christ*. I am seeking to point out how the ability for preaching is attained, but in order to find that you have it, you must first preach.
{348}
Philip no doubt realised that *he* could do nothing, but the preaching of Christ implies that *He* can do everything, for He was anointed to effect all for God. All the preaching is by Christ; He "preached the glad tidings of peace to you who were afar off, and the glad tidings of peace to those who were nigh" (@Ephesians 2:17); it is all done by Christ Himself: "Whether Christ should suffer; whether he ... should announce light both to the people and to the nations" @Acts 26:23. This feature of manhood on the banks of the river, so to speak, attained a great result in Samaria, and there was divine recognition of it, for when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent down Peter and John. Then Philip is recognised by heaven -- through the angel. The angel represents the providence of God; another sphere of service is opened up to him.
As there is a disposition to serve, God in His providence makes way for you; it is not always necessary to leave your secular employment, for in the providence of God your employment may be the means of placing you where you can serve effectively. Here it is the divine recognition of Philip in a providential way, and although you cannot always know God by providence, yet it is evident here that the providence of God is concerned with the preaching. God may thus send you to some place where you would not naturally go; thus we need to be careful not to allow our natural feelings to act. Paul says, "if I announce the glad tidings, I have nothing to boast of; for a necessity is laid upon me; for it is woe to me if I should not announce the glad tidings. For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward; but if not of my own will, I am entrusted with an administration" @1 Corinthians 9:16,17.
So Philip goes to the desert; there was nothing there to attract one governed by the flesh; and as the Ethiopian passes, the Holy Spirit says to Philip,
{349}
"Approach and join this chariot" @Acts 8:29. It is a great thing to be spoken to by the Spirit of God; later, Philip was caught away by the Spirit; he is entirely under the control of the Spirit. The Holy Spirit honours Philip by calling him "the evangelist" @Acts 21:8. This feature of manhood as expressed in Philip is greatly needed at the present time, and he is an encouragement to all who would come forward to preach. The Holy Spirit will direct you, and you will be duly honoured, as Philip was. He is said to have had four daughters who prophesied -- showing that his influence in his house was good.
I finish now by referring to Paul, who specially comes into our present subject, for he towers above all the others. He comes before us in @Acts 9, and in him we see that feature of manhood brought to light which is connected with a *change* in the ways of God; for when Paul appears, new movements of God are seen. Stephen and Philip came forward voluntarily, but now the Lord takes a direct hand in providing servants. We must always look for this -- direct movement from the Lord Himself; when you see those in responsibility lagging behind, you may depend upon it that the Lord will Himself take matters in hand; He must be ever in control, so here (@Acts 9) He converts and sends out a great preacher. He speaks from heaven and converts Saul of Tarsus and makes him the mightiest of His vessels of grace; Paul could say, "His grace which was towards me, has not been vain; but I have laboured more abundantly than they all" @1 Corinthians 15:10. This is manhood in a peculiar connection -- manhood brought in by the Lord as changing the whole state of affairs. Saul began by prayer, "What shall I do, Lord?" @Acts 22:10. It is a question now of what the *Lord* is going to do, and He sends Saul to the assembly: "rise up and enter into the city" @Acts 9:6. The Lord even goes before to prepare the brethren to receive him, for He
{350}
tells Ananias to arise and go to Saul, and his introduction is, "Behold, he is praying" @Acts 9:11. It was *that kind* of manhood, such as marked the Lord Jesus Himself; for prayer is expressive of one in entire dependence upon God.
Well, brethren, that is all I have to say; my thought is that this wonderful dispensation that we have been speaking about has been inaugurated in suffering, in Christ; it is to be continued in suffering, and it is to end in suffering. If it is to end in suffering, it must be suffering in *men*. The men I have spoken of were all marked by suffering, and so it should be in our time. Remember what the apostle said to Timothy, "Take thy share in suffering" (@2 Timothy 2:3), and "but suffer evil along with the glad tidings, according to the power of God" (@2 Timothy 1:8), and exhibit that spirit of forgiveness which is based on righteousness, and which was so perfectly expressed by the Lord Himself when He said, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do".

THE WORK AND THE WORKMEN
@2 Timothy 2:15; @Zechariah 13:5,6; @Luke 17:7 - 10; @Mark 13:34,35
I have in mind in linking up these four scriptures together, to speak of the work and the workmen. It is not my thought to confine my remarks to those who are, as we say, actively engaged in the Lord's work, but that all may see that it is a time of work, calling for work-people; some, as we may say in ordinary language, skilled, others relatively unskilled, but all responsible to have a part in the work. Of old, as you will remember, the Levites representing the saints from this point of view, were numbered from a month old and upward (@Numbers 2:15); all were held for service, and the service which we speak of as levitical was no light service. The word in @Numbers 4:3 implies labour, toil, and so, having this in view, the Lord Jesus, who is "the prince of princes of the Levites" (@Numbers 3:32), sets out for us the true idea of workmanship; indeed, it begins with God Himself. We are therefore in no mean company, however menial our part may be in the work. It is a work in which God Himself has His part. The Lord says, "My Father worketh hitherto", @John 5:17. God had wrought in what we speak of as the material universe, the workmanship being pieced out by the day, and indeed it is only a day at a time even with God Himself. The work was by the day, each day having its own work; but He ceased from His labour, we are told, having finished it.
But the Lord does not allude to that when He says, "My Father worketh hitherto" @John 5:17. He alludes to a subsequent work, which began immediately on the
{352}
incoming of sin, as, for example, the clothing by which Adam and Eve were clothed was the workmanship of God. And so the Lord Jesus becoming Man takes it up; and He says, "and I work" @John 5:17. I hope to touch presently on the manner and spirit of His work.
In the apostle Paul we have that work carried on connected, as we may say, with one man. Others, indeed, had been taken up, as we know, but he says that he laboured more abundantly than they all. I wish you to note the recurrence, the frequency of the recurrence of the words 'work', 'workmen' and 'workmanship' in his epistles, his epistles having in mind as a feature to induce the spirit of working and to discredit the spirit of idleness. And not only that, but in him we get what we get in God, what we get in Christ, that is to say, *completion* of work. You will all remember how the Lord upbraids the assembly at Sardis, saying, "I have not found thy works complete before my God" @Revelation 3:2. Whatever they may have been before men, they were not complete before God. Much has been done, and is being done in what assumes to be the assembly, much that draws out the praise and admiration of men; notables of history, divines come under review as great workers, highly approved and commended by men; but in our work, beloved, it is with God we have to do. And so the Lord says, "I have not found thy works complete *before my God*" @Revelation 3:2. That church stands over against workers who complete what is given them to do, or what they undertake to do; hence, as I have been saying, God finished His work -- the work was completed. The Lord Jesus Christ finished His work; as He said, "I have completed the work which thou gavest that I should do it" (@John 17:4), and so of Paul -- honoured as he thus is, as in many other respects -- after his first missionary journey with Barnabas, it is said of them that they finished the work which had been entrusted to them (see @Acts 14:26) -- a most important feature,
{353}
for whilst there is a disposition, especially among the young, to take up service, very often, as with John Mark, it is left off and left unfinished; it is said of him he "had not gone with them to the work" @Acts 15:38.
Now I want to show you from Zechariah -- coming back to Timothy later -- how the spirit of workmanship appeared in Christ. The earlier verses of chapter 13 speak of false prophecy, of which, alas! there is much at the present time, and what comes out is that in the latter day the father and the mother of a false prophet will put him to death. We are thus notified of the importance of the disallowance of natural feelings and affections in regard of those who serve. We know how Barnabas was affected in regard of John Mark; it was natural affection, and resulted in the severance of the two great servants who together had fulfilled the work that had been given them, and for which they had been committed to the grace of God. Mothers favouring their sons, fathers favouring their sons, and sisters favouring their brothers, all has to be dealt with, and refused, if the work is to go on according to God in a true levitical way. And so in the chapter it goes on to speak of the prophet denouncing all this, and refusing to wear hairy garments to deceive. Garments worn to distinguish us for service are disallowed in this passage, even although they be hairy ones -- garments which may cause us discomfort; for the flesh goes a long way in order to obtain religious distinction and reputation. What we speak of as 'the cloth' is disallowed.
And then the Lord, as I understand it, says, "I am no prophet". Wonderful remark! indicating His complete self-abnegation and refusal of religious reputation in this world. I need not remark, beloved, how much a prophet He was -- the Prophet of God. I am speaking of His own attitude publicly, His
{354}
attitude and spirit; there was no attempt to build up or establish religious reputation, He was just an ordinary man, as He says, "The Son of man has come eating and drinking" @Matthew 11:19. He came in a most ordinary way -- a carpenter -- as we are told in the gospels. How unlike a prophet according to man's thought! No hairy garment to deceive or mere fleshly self-abnegation in order to establish religious reputation; all that is abhorrent to God. The reputation to be acquired, as it was in the Lord Himself, was moral; it soon came to light, but He said, "I am no prophet"; "for man acquired me as bondman from my youth". Think of that! You say, I am a servant of God; but what about being a servant of man? That may be too menial. One is afraid of people who class themselves as servants of God, not that I am denying there are such, surely, but I am speaking now of those who call themselves thus. How easily we may endeavour to clothe ourselves with dignity in a public way!
So the Lord says, "I am a tiller of the ground; for man acquired me as bondman from my youth". This is how the greatest of all servants undertook His ministry. It is presented as a model for us, and no one need hope to aspire to any effective service in any other spirit than in that which is indicated here. He says, "man acquired me". If you look at it from that point of view, it may involve what is menial. The great apostle said, "Ourselves your bondmen for Jesus¬ sake" @2 Corinthians 4:5. And so the Lord here is a tiller of the ground, acquired by man as a bondman to keep cattle. And then in His service others inquire, "What are those wounds in thy hands?" Acquired in service; marvellous to see that in serving He acquired wounds in His hands! Let us not forget, beloved, that in the service of the Lord the wounds will come -- are sure to come. If we serve as Christ did, if we decline honour from man as
{355}
He did, and if we avoid appealing to men's feelings and sensibilities as He did, we shall incur their disapproval, we shall incur their opposition, we shall incur wounds from them. These things are not inviting, but it is only kindness that brethren should understand that the service of God involves wounds. Where did He receive the wounds? In the house of His friends -- not from the heathen, not from those who are without, as we speak, but from those who are professedly friends. The most vicious of all wounds are such, but we may expect them. One could easily show -- not only in the Lord's life, but also in that of the apostles, particularly Paul's -- how such wounds were inflicted upon the very hands that served. Paul says, "These hands have ministered to my wants, and to those who were with me" @Acts 20:34. Hands are the symbols of power in service, and the very service only incurred the wounds.
I do not go on to speak of other wounds, received governmentally, although we may come under the government of God in our service, for the sword came against the man who is Jehovah's fellow (verse 7). But while we may incur the government of God, and we must expect His governmental dealings with us, yet we shall never endure anything like what is spoken of here. Our Lord went on to the cross; He received wounds from God; these were vicarious. I do not dwell on them, but they touch the heart; He served men as acquired by them to serve, and He received wounds from them, but then He went on and received wounds from God. Such was His part, beloved brethren, and path of service! There was the smiting of the Shepherd; I would only speak of it, if I may, in the light of government. The government of God is to be respected. The Lord is said in Hebrews to be at the right hand of the throne of God. He is presented at the right hand in many aspects in Hebrews, but in chapter 12, where the
{356}
discipline of God is in view, and where the race is in view, He is at the right hand of the *throne* of God. The throne of God represents His government. At the present time the position of Christ as at the right hand of the throne of God implies discipline, it implies chastening; not punitive, but for our good; "for who is the son that the father chastens not?" (@Hebrews 12:7) and "Ye endure for chastening, God conducts himself towards you as towards sons" @Hebrews 12:7. We must expect discipline, yea, we value it as we understand it. The throne here is that at the right hand of which Christ sits, having run the whole course of faith -- "the leader and completer of faith" @Hebrews 12:2.
I want now to go on to Luke, to show from the Lord's words how He intended that His apostles should be marked as workmen by His own spirit and ways. You will observe in looking at the passage that the apostles, as such, had asked that their faith might be increased. The passage deals with his apostles; the word is "apostles" there, not 'disciples', as is usual. Now apostleship, as I understand it, implies representation, it implies authority. The Lord intended that as going out of this world, He should be represented in it. When here He maintained divine authority in heavenly grace, as He said to His opponents, "That ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, he said to the paralysed man, I say to thee, Arise, and take up thy little couch and go to thine house" @Luke 5:24. The miracle was to establish that He had authority, and the apostles in Luke represent His authority. I think that Luke makes more of apostleship than the other writers, for it is essential to the effective working of grace. The apostles were to be furnished; they were to be able to say to the sycamine tree, "Be thou rooted up, and be thou planted in the sea" (@Luke 17:6); that is to say, all that stood in the way of grace should be removed, and it was
{357}
removed. Judaism in all its power was removed. Then what comes to light is workmanship; the Lord emphasises that, and He calls upon them to consider. "Which of you is there who having a bondman ploughing or shepherding?" You may say, I have never thought of such work as that in the service of God. But it is wholesome to see that what is in view is the most onerous kind of work. The Lord had set it out in Himself, He was a tiller of the ground, and to till the ground we must plough. Ploughing is perhaps one of the most arduous labours of a farmer, or a husbandman, but without it there could be no crop. You see, therefore, beloved, what a task lay before the apostles of Christ. They were not to be men known as leaders in this world, filling up the halls of fame of this world; they were not to be that; they were to be ploughers of the field, tillers of the soil; and then they were to feed and take care of the cattle. The service of God implies the most arduous and menial kind of work, first ploughing the soil, and then caring for the cattle.
You cannot care for cattle save by getting up early. Jacob is the great type in Scripture of one who cared for cattle: "In the day the heat consumed me, and the frost by night" @Genesis 31:40. Cattle need continual attention; he who cares for them has to be attendant on them at all times. But the master after all that the servant has done when he comes in says, "Prepare ... and gird thyself and serve me". The servant might say, I have done something, I have done a hard day's work, it is surely my due that I should now be waited on. How many of the Lord's professing servants expect that, expect to have the very best! I am not now speaking of what is their due, for Paul insists that he who preaches the gospel should live of the gospel; that is another side to what I have in view; but the servant here comes in and the Master says, 'Set on for Me'; of what
{358}
value is all this toil save as I get something out of it? Christ must get something out of the toil; it is not for yourself at all. You may think you are deserving of something out of it! No; it is for the Master; you set on for me, let me eat and drink. You see thus the position which service implies; what exercise, what humiliation. The keenest thing of all is the humiliating feature of the service. And then you have to say yourself (not that others should say it for you, but you have to say yourself), 'I am an unprofitable bondman', and the most striking thing of all, "we have done what it was our duty to do".
I turn now to Mark's gospel, and, as you might expect, it is not there the onerous nature of the work, the arduous character of it, but the work itself, and what yours is to be; that is to say, it is a question of distribution, for one is not to do all the work, as it says, "he has given some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers" @Ephesians 4:11. There is variety in the workmen and in the work, and the Lord is the distributor. And so He speaks about the man going out of the country, going a long way, and the house being left. Note it is not now ploughing or looking after cattle; these are not mentioned; but it is the house. There is the house here, and the Lord says He gives authority to His bondmen, or as it should read, *the* authority. I have been speaking about authority in apostles; the apostles have gone, but the authority has not gone; it remains -- "*the* authority" relative to the house. We must never overlook that the authority has been given; He gave the authority, it says, and to each one his work; that is Mark.
Now we come to what I may call the dignity side; the house is not the field, there is no ploughing or shepherding needed in the house, it is the family sphere. You will understand when I speak of ploughing or shepherding I have the spiritual thoughts in
{359}
view, as each has to do with the saints. When you come to the house we are in the family, and what is needed is authority. If I plough, I need skill, and I need physical strength; and so, too, in looking after cattle. No doubt a cow recognises certain authority in a man, but that is creational; that is what God has set in the creation; but when we come to the family the authority must be moral. It is based on affection; it is based on family relationships; and the authority is given, and it exists in the house. It is a question of what is moral, and the power one may exercise through moral weight in the house. Timothy and Titus give specific instructions as to the authority in regard of those who care for the assembly, but we have also to remember that government is a *gift*. There are persons who have authority in government who may never qualify according to Timothy and Titus. Paul had the gift of government; he had moral power given him of God to influence the saints in the way of authority. And so here the Lord gave the authority, and then to every man his work. We may be sure that whilst speaking of the arduous character of the work, and the menial and humiliating character of it, that the Lord will never give us more to do than we are equal to, and the work He gives us to do we are qualified for -- to each one his work; and He will support us in it; hence it is to be carried on on the principle of the measure of faith, and the grace that He gives. We are to carry on the work according to the apportionment, whatever it may be, and then according to the measure of faith and of grace that the Lord gives. You see, therefore, how poised, how regulated everything is in service, so that the work of God should not be impeded, that it should go on, each knowing what his part is, and doing it according to the example of Christ, and of the apostle Paul.
Having said all this, it is only a question now of
{360}
appeal. The need is great at the present time; as the Lord said to His disciples, "Lift up your eyes and behold the fields, for they are already white to harvest" @John 4:35. The need is great, but whilst that is so, He will not accept workmen save on His own terms, and He makes it perfectly plain what you may expect -- the present portion. What you will have by-and-by I have not touched on, but you may depend upon it that God is no man's debtor and for every bit of work you do for Christ you will find in the doing of it ample compensation.
Now in coming to Timothy, which is for the last days, it is still by way of appeal. The apostle says, "Strive diligently to present thyself, ... a workman that has not to be ashamed" @2 Timothy 2:15. That is the word for us at the present time -- the time of @2 Timothy. But although we are in a day of small things, and notwithstanding the irregular outward appearance of things, yet the work has to go on, but it is to go on according to divine order, "Strive diligently to present thyself approved to God ... cutting in a straight line the word of truth" @2 Timothy 2:15. The word of truth is brought in here as the great working material. No doubt people of the world wonder why we have always got our Bibles. The workmen of God are never to be without them. But now here it is not only a question of *having* the holy writings, but the passage tells us how important they are: "Every scripture is divinely inspired, and profitable for teaching ... that the man of God may be complete, fully fitted to every good work" @2 Timothy 3:16,17.
And now I only add a word as to the importance of using the Scriptures aright. One is very conscious of one's inability to use them rightly, but one is encouraged to speak of the importance of cutting in a straight line the word of truth, that is to say, of not using them for any other purpose than the establishment of the truth. Let Scripture speak for itself, learn *how* to use them according to their own
{361}
proper setting; they will thus furnish the man of God unto every good work.
May the Lord help us! As I said, the need is great, but the Lord will have the work carried on on His own terms according to His own way, and He looks for men to take up the service.
{362}
LEADERSHIP
@Hebrews 12:2,3; @Psalm 77:20; @Psalm 78:70 - 72
I want to speak to you this evening about leadership -- leadership in the things of God. It is God's way in carrying His people through this world to employ this means -- that of leadership, and the Lord may help us in our inquiry to see some of the features that mark true leadership. As in all else, we have to learn *from* and *in* Christ, for He is not only the Teacher, but He is what He teaches.
I have selected the epistle to the Hebrews first, because the idea is emphasised there, being seen more in that epistle in relation to the Jewish Christians than in relation to others, for they were encompassed as connected with God's ancient economy, with what tended to darken and make the path difficult. The position of these Jewish Christians in the early days corresponds to a great extent with our own, for around us there are similar conditions. What claims to be connected with God, but is not really so, implies much that darkens and bewilders, so that the path of the people of God is extremely difficult. The epistle to the Hebrews, therefore, is of peculiar value to us in many respects, and not the least in this, that it emphasises the idea of leadership. In it we have a beautiful touch in regard to God's leading His people of old. It says He "took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt", @Hebrews 8:9. It is not stated that He led them *in* by the hand, but that He led them *out* by the hand. He led them in also, but He led them in through their minds and their affections, for they had advanced; but He took them by *the hand* to lead them out. We read, too, that He "taught Ephraim to walk", @Hosea 11:3. These are infantile references, showing how God can come down
{363}
to the smallest growth amongst His people in order to lead them. It says, too, "He nursed them in the desert" (@Acts 13:18) -- a beautiful touch! and further, that He walked with them in all their ways -- the ark of the covenant going before to find a resting-place for them. In such language God conveys to us His tender sympathies and His consideration for us, especially for those who have not advanced in the truth; and so too in this epistle, which, indeed, treats of the infantile condition -- not a normal one, alas! but one that resulted from retrogression.
Israel in Egypt was in a normal infantile condition; it was such a condition as occasioned and drew out the love of Jehovah; He said, "When Israel was a child, then I loved him", @Hosea 11:1. There was that freshness and beauty of youth at the outset which drew out the affections of God; then follows, "and out of Egypt I called my son" (@Hosea 11:1), but there is first the freshness and beauty as seen in early spiritual life, which is delightful to God, and which corresponds to the epistle to the Thessalonians, which epistle treats of Christians in their early youth -- a normal youthfulness. Nor are they treated as so many persons; for although very young in their spiritual life, they are treated as an assembly: "The assembly of Thessalonians in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ" @1 Thessalonians 1:1. It is the only assembly addressed in this way. They were beloved of God and so the apostle says, "but have been gentle in the midst of you, as a nurse would cherish her own children" (@1 Thessalonians 2:7); and then again, "ye know how, as a father his own children, we used to exhort each one of you, and comfort and testify" @1 Thessalonians 2:11. God thus indicates to us what early spiritual life is, and it should be encouraging to the youngest of us.
God delights in early spiritual freshness, but then, on the other hand, it was His son He called out of Egypt. He took the *child* by the hand and taught him to walk, but, He says, I called my *son*
{364}
out of Egypt, for whilst He delights in youthfulness, His thought goes beyond that, His thought is maturity, His purpose is sonship, and sonship involves maturity, so that the son does not need to be taken by the hand; the son *goes* into Canaan. He is called out of Egypt; it is a question of the purpose of God, and His purpose is sonship; and so He calls us sons, and because we are sons, He gives us the Spirit of His Son in our hearts, and having that Spirit in our hearts we are *led* by the Spirit -- a very different thing from being taken by the hand. "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God" @Romans 8:14. In the history of Israel it was after forty years¬ experience in the desert in which God led them, and fed them, and nursed them, that they come into the good of the Spirit, and typically in the power of the Spirit they followed the ark of the covenant into the land of promise. They went in by way of affection, and of intelligence. But whether as led by the hand or as led by the Spirit, they were led by God.
Now, whilst God leads His people, He leads them mediately, that is to say, He leads them through others, first of all through Christ, so that, as I said, we have to learn this thought in Him. I have selected these verses in Hebrews because the apostle emphasises the idea of leadership particularly in this passage, where the word 'author' or 'leader' is used in the sense of one who, as many of us here know, sets the thing forward, who inaugurates it, originates it, so that we are at the very source of the thing. We are called upon to look on Jesus, for it is a question here, not of what He teaches by word, but by example; hence it is that we look *on* Him, and in order to look on Jesus, the author and completer of faith, we have to understand the gospels.
Now what I wish to dwell on particularly, and what the passage dwells on is *faith*. To have part in
{365}
this dispensation we must have faith. It may not be needed in the millennium, for then things will be on the principle of sight, but at the present time, to have part in what God is going on with there must be faith: "He that draws near to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them who seek him out" @Hebrews 11:6. There is very little to *see* at the present time; hence, the greater need for faith. And so it was at this particular juncture of the history of the Jewish Christians, for the time of miracles was passing, and the things spoken by the Lord had already been confirmed, and after a thing is confirmed there is no need of further miracles; the thing is there; to give it up is apostasy, and there are no miracles for apostates. The only miracles that an apostate shall have will be those of antichrist, and it is solemn to think there will be such. What is needed therefore when things are confirmed is faith, and hence the great features of it are given in chapter 11, so that these Hebrew Christians should know what it was, and then, instead of looking for further miracles, further external interventions of God, they were to exercise faith. True Christians among them were characterised by believing: "We are not drawers back to perdition, but of faith to saving the soul" @Hebrews 10:39.
And then the writer shows that the faith that they had was illustrated in its varied features in the people of God of old, and having gone over the ground he comes to Jesus, of whom he says, "The leader and completer of faith" -- He is the Beginner of the thing. Faith did not begin with Abel. When God framed the world He had in mind that the thing should be understood by faith; it was never His intention that men should discover anything in the physical system in a final sense by investigation, by natural powers. I do not believe there is one single thing that is final in what scientific men
{366}
speak of. God intended that the thing should be apprehended by faith: "By faith we apprehend that the worlds were framed by the word of God" @Hebrews 11:3. I think that God intended to distinguish this dispensation above all others in that way. Things are to be understood in it. He begins therefore with the beginning, in dealing with faith: "By faith we apprehend that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that that which is seen should not take its origin from things which appear" @Hebrews 11:3. It is a question of the word of God. The soul is put directly in touch with God in regard of these things. Faith was anticipated, and the Framer of the thing, the great Architect of it was to be the Beginner and Completer of the faith that was to shine in this dispensation. It is a wonderful dispensation -- that God should work out His greatest and His eternal thoughts in connection with faith.
Of the Lord it is said, in chapter 1, "upholding all things by the word of his power" (@Hebrews 1:3), but here in this chapter (12) He is the One presented to us as a model, as an example -- not, surely, as the Creator, or the Framer of the universe, but as walking a path as man here, as we have to walk it. You see the dispensation was in the mind of God; He intended this dispensation to shine out, to stand out above all others; so it is called God's dispensation which is in faith. The great principle is inaugurated or begun by the Lord Jesus as Man here, and so, as I said, we have to look into the gospels to see the marvellous design of God -- that the very Creator Himself could be in such circumstances! "I was cast upon thee", He says, "from the womb", @Psalm 22:10. From the very outset of His being here, He was dependent upon God. Who can understand it? That *He* should be in such circumstances, that there was never a moment in His existence as a Man in this world that was not lived on this principle. Those
{367}
thirty years that followed are filled up, and no doubt what there was for God in them will yet be brought to light. The Holy Spirit lights on the Lord's infancy and on His boyhood, but we have nothing for eighteen years. But what were those years to God! Was there a moment in those years that was not delightful to heaven? Not one. Every breath of that holy Babe, of that Boy, of that Man, was taken in faith.
It was a marvellous design, and carried out in the minutest detail in that holy life, and hence Scripture abounds with the detail of it -- the meat-offering sets it forth. The types are full of it, and the meat-offering is for the priests -- that we should understand what the nature of that life was and grow in it: "In this thy nature grow". What is omitted in the gospels abounds in the types. The types abound with the humanity of Christ, what He was from His infancy onward, what He was to God; so the priests could feed on it and thus understand what the life of faith is, what man according to God is here. Hence He is presented to look *on*, to look steadfastly on and to "consider well", it says. But to do this, beloved, we have to read Scripture and we have to understand Scripture, particularly the types, for, as I said, what is omitted intentionally in the gospels is depicted in the types. And God at the end of the thirty years uses the word 'found': "This is my beloved Son, in whom I have *found* my delight", @Matthew 3:17. It is absolute. You will observe it does not say 'all' there -- found all my delight -- for God had all that should develop out of that in His mind; everything that will be evolved out of that came under the eye of God for His pleasure.
Now I go further. One could continue to dwell on such a marvellous subject, but I can only just suggest what the life of faith was in Jesus. Luke particularly points it out for us, and so we have more prayer of the Lord in Luke than elsewhere, particularly
{368}
as you come to the close, so that He should be rightly in view as a model in Gethsemane -- indeed, it is not Gethsemane in Luke, but the mount of Olives. We read there that He went, as was His custom, to the mount of Olives, He had often been there. I have no doubt it was His holy retreat. Bethany was His retreat in relation to the remnant; Olivet was His relation to heaven; His custom, according to Luke, was to go there, and as there, He is withdrawn from His disciples a stone's throw. It seems as if He is presented objectively, to be seen, as it were, clearly. He had said to them that they should pray, but He does not pray with them; and He is withdrawn from them. It is a question in the gospels of what is objective, of what is to be learned objectively in Christ; it is what is seen in the model, and so He is withdrawn from them about a stone's throw and He kneels down and prays. Marvellous spectacle! Reverential, of course, but it was for them to see the idea as He is approaching the last solemn moments of His life. Then we read, "and being in conflict he prayed more intently" @Luke 22:44. It is perfect humanity tested to the utmost. What a spectacle to look on! And that is the point here; looking steadfastly on Him, as if we were in company with those who were privileged to be with Him at that moment, looking steadfastly on that blessed Man and seeing Him kneel down, and pray, and then the agony, and then the praying more intently -- not as with ourselves where there is the possibility of unbelief. The thing is, "Does any one among you suffer evil? let him pray", @James 5:13. The greater the affliction, the more intent the prayer. And so on the cross itself, in Luke, He is praying. It is a Man dependent upon God and asking Him to inaugurate the dispensation -- the dispensation of faith. It was to be a dispensation in which things are brought in by the asking, and so He asks the Father to forgive them. He ushers in
{369}
the dispensation of grace in that wonderful prayer: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do" @Luke 23:34.
But I must pass on. I want to show that there can be no leadership apart from faith. This was first seen in Christ, faith being exemplified for us in Him. It being the dispensation of faith, a true leader must be a man of faith, he must learn to look away from seen things and to bring God in, to reckon on the power and faithfulness of God; he moves on in that way. He despises the shame, too, for there will be shame, there will be reproach attached to it, but he sees the end, as Jesus, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despised the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. That throne is rendered favourable by the presence of Jesus; in this epistle He is seen "on the right hand of the greatness on high" (@Hebrews 1:3); "on the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens" (@Hebrews 8:1); "at the right hand of God" (@Hebrews 10:12); and lastly "at the right hand of the throne of God" @Hebrews 12:2. The throne is favourable, and the leader can reckon on all the dealings of God with His people being favourable, for God is not against His people in any sense. This passage shows not only that the throne is favourable, but that it is active too, for the government of God goes on with every one of us. Hence discipline flows from it, and the saints are treated, not as enemies, not as sinners, but as sons; they are made to be partakers of the holiness of God. The leader amongst the saints understands this, and he can reckon on the throne being rendered favourable, and ever active to help the people of God.
Now I wish to touch on Moses and Aaron. The apostle and High Priest of our confession is Jesus. It says in @Psalm 77:20 that God led His people by the hand of Moses and Aaron; these two represent
{370}
the qualities of leadership. In the first epistle to Timothy and in that to Titus we have qualifications for eldership. It is quite obvious that every brother is not to be an elder. It is put, "If any one aspires to exercise oversight" @1 Timothy 3:1. It is a question of one who aspires to an office. Strictly there are no such offices today, I need not say, nor should we assume that they exist; nevertheless, there was the idea of one aspiring to be an elder or overseer, and the qualifications are given. There is no suggestion in that that every one should aspire to be an elder or an overseer, nor is there any thought that those who are not overseers are not to be interested in the order and government of the house of God. As a matter of fact, responsibility rests on every one in the assembly, and certainly both addresses to the Corinthians are to the assembly. The responsibility rests on it.
I refer to that in connection with Moses and Aaron, because God led the people through them. God was there; He was there every inch of the way, but the leadership externally was in these two men, and I take them to represent the qualities for leadership as *combined* in a leader.
You will bear with me if I touch on these two men, and I go back to the earlier history so as to bring out what the combination was, as it was remarkable. Moses had been forty years in the desert with the sheep; he led the flock to the backside of the desert and God met Him there. He saw God. God was in the bush, and Moses saw the great sight; he turned aside to see, it says. One is of no value really in the service until he turns aside to see what God presents. The thing that God presents to you is so interesting that you turn aside to see it, and thus Moses is signalised. God says, "Moses, Moses" (@Exodus 3:4), but Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God. Now, God says, you go back to Egypt and I will be
{371}
with your mouth; you are to say this and that to the people, but Moses replies that he cannot speak. Full of light, full of experience, but he fails in his speech! Well, God says, Aaron thy brother the Levite shall speak, and he comes to meet you, and when he sees you there will be gladness in his heart; see @Exodus 4:14. You have the light, you have the authority, Aaron will be the mouth; but, more than that, Aaron is the brother, he will be glad in his heart to see you (as a matter of fact he kissed him) and God says to Moses, Aaron will be to thee instead of a mouth, thou shalt put words in his mouth; he will speak, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.
I wish you to take note of this, so that you may see the mediatorial idea in the service of leadership. Here is a man who is to be as God. Can I impress the saints as representative of God? I certainly cannot impress them unless I impress them in some sense that I represent God. Let us not be afraid of it -- of the idea of representation. Here is a man who says he cannot speak, a shepherd in the wilderness, and yet God says, "Thou shalt be to him for God" (@Exodus 4:16), that is to Aaron, and then again, "I have made thee God to Pharaoh" @Exodus 7:1. What a sense of obligation such a man would have! I refer to it so that we might understand the greatness of the idea of leadership; that there is in it the element of God and the authority of God, that the presence of God is in it, so that the saints understand that you have to do with God in your service amongst them -- that you represent Him. And then alongside of that you have the mouth of a brother, for Aaron was the one who was to represent that; he was to be on the side of the people. If he spoke to them, he was to give them to understand that he was one of them; he had compassion on the ignorant and erring; there is nothing arbitrary about Aaron. The authority of God is imperative; but Aaron is the sympathetic
{372}
element, hence you find that in writing to the Corinthians, in both epistles, the apostle associates a brother with him. There is the authority of God in the apostle, but with that there is the sympathy and affection of the brother. In the first letter he associates Sosthenes; not *a* brother simply, but "*the* brother" (@1 Corinthians 1:1) -- as if characterised by the idea. In the second letter he links Timotheus with him. How can we have these things brought down? We see them in Moses and Aaron, we see them in the apostle and Sosthenes and Timotheus; is that idea to lapse? Not at all. God carries it through, and He carries through the idea of leadership, and if the idea is to be present in a concrete way amongst us, these elements must be present -- the sense of the presence of God, the authority of God on the one hand, and the tenderness and sympathy of a brother on the other. And so "if even a man be taken in some fault, ye who are spiritual restore such a one", @Galatians 6:1. Even if he be taken in it, who is going to restore him? "Ye who are spiritual" restore him. Whatever the man's circumstances, apparently, if he is spiritual he can do that, he can restore him. In the spirit of meekness, "*considering thyself* lest *thou* also be tempted" (@Galatians 6:1), is the spirit of Aaron.
I think what I have said about these two men will indicate plainly that the leading in the wilderness by the hand of Moses and Aaron is a combination of divine authority, light, and intelligence, with the sympathy of a man -- the sympathy of a brother. "Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron".
Now I go on to David. He is the next leader spoken of here. I do not say that there were not others, because Deborah speaks about leaders who led. A leader is of no value unless he leads: "for that leaders led in Israel" (@Judges 5:2), she says. They led in the right way. But David stands out, as
{373}
Moses and Aaron stand out; and when we come to David it is a question of sovereign choice. It is not now intelligence that predominates, nor even the sympathy as in Aaron, but loveliness of character; the kind of person you are, as it were, inherently. David is brought on the scene in Scripture as "ruddy, and besides of a lovely countenance and beautiful appearance" (@1 Samuel 16:12); he is brought in in his youthfulness. He is not brought in to illustrate experience as Moses was; he is brought in in his ruddiness, in his beauty, that is to say, he is a person delightful to God; he is inherently delightful to God. The Lord says, "Arise, anoint him; for this is he" @1 Samuel 16:12. It is a question of the kind of person, of what the man is from his beginnings. This brother who is helpful among us -- what has he been from his beginning? You say, he has been disciplined by God. But what kind of a beginning has he had? The word 'David' means 'beloved'; it refers to the delight that God had in him. The first mention of David's name in the book of Samuel was when he was anointed. *David* was anointed; that is to say, God anointed the beloved, the one whom He loved, the one who pleased Him in his youthfulness.
So in Psalm 78 he is chosen. There is nothing said about Moses and Aaron being chosen, but David is chosen; and he is immediately called a servant, but that is not what one becomes suddenly. You see some who take short cuts to service, but there are no short cuts in Scripture; the idea of being a servant begins with yourself. You will always find in a man whom God uses, that the idea of being a servant began with him; it is there inherently; hence David is here chosen and he is called a servant. What had he been doing? He had been "Following the suckling-ewes". Following them, he was a servant. If they went astray, he went after them. I need not go into it -- the story of David is well known
{374}
to us -- but I dwell upon this one feature, that he was chosen of God. He was a servant of God, as he was following the ewes great with young. In his mind there would be great increase; he saw to that, and so it is with those who have grown up with the features of the servant from the outset; that which pleases God -- multiplication -- is always in view. David followed the ewes great with young, and God took him from that to feed Jacob His people and Israel His inheritance.
In speaking thus of David, the thought before me is looking at the saints according to what they are to God. How do I know what they are to God? I look at Christ as here publicly. He was delightful to God. I think of myself when I was converted, when I received the Spirit -- I was delightful to God. I am not speaking of theories; we should be conscious of divine pleasure. Is it too great a thing to say that God intends that every one of us should be to His pleasure? David was to His pleasure. One thing was remarkable about David and that is the comparative shortness of his life. There are many in this room who are older than he was and they are yet fresh, but he is regarded as an old man at seventy. He reigned forty years, which was not extraordinary. In truth, he was like Jesus, the greater David. Think of the immensity that was compressed into *that* life! The life of Jesus was less than half that of David, but see what there was for God in it! John says that if the many other things which Jesus did were written one by one, "I suppose that not even the world itself would contain the books written" @John 21:25. Think of all that being compressed into His life of thirty-three years! So with David, it was a life that afforded pleasure to God. We have in the book of Chronicles (@1 Chronicles 29:30) that the prophet Nathan wrote about him; that Gad the seer wrote about him, and that the prophet Samuel wrote about
{375}
him. Why should all these great men write about David? For what reason other than to record the things that were pleasing to God? They were worth recording. *Prophets* do not record what is not worth recording; the seers do not record what is not worth recording. Nathan and Gad saw wonderful things in that man and they wrote them down; they were to be read. Samuel saw wonderful things in him and he wrote them down, and so it is that David presents leadership as pleasing to God; he was chosen.
Is it not a great thought, beloved, to be chosen of God in this way to service? As it says here, "to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance". David understood the value of the people to God; he understood that they were the inheritance. At Ephesus the elders are more signalised than any others, but the epistle to the Ephesians contemplates the saints as the inheritance of God, "the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints" @Ephesians 1:18. As you see that you would gladly "spend and be utterly spent" (@2 Corinthians 12:15) for them. They are for the pleasure of God.
Of David it says, "He fed them according to the integrity of his heart and led them by the skilfulness of his hands". With David, it is not what God said he *should* do, it is what he *did*. He represents the spiritual man. With Moses and Aaron it is a question of what Jehovah said to them, and the people were led by these two men because they obeyed the commandments of the Lord given through them. But with David it is a question of spiritual discernment and wisdom; you know what to do, you know what the saints are to God, you care for them according to the integrity of your heart and guide them by the skilfulness of your hands, that is, you do your very best for them. All that you are is to be devoted to the service and leading of the people of God.
{376}
THE RIVER OF GOD
@Matthew 18:19,20; @Ezekiel 47:1 - 12
My object in reading these passages is that we may see what the effect of the presence of the Spirit is here. Broadly speaking, the effect of Christianity, rightly apprehended, is to produce living conditions. It was the divine thought that what God would present in the way of teaching and preaching should be accompanied by living conditions -- the evidence of life, for only thus is the doctrine of Christianity verified. We have the principle in our Lord, of whom it is said, "In him was life, and the life was the light of men" @John 1:4. What He said was life, because He was altogether that which He said. There was the truth expressed in a living way in the Lord here; what He said, He was.
Now I wish to show from these scriptures that the presence of the Spirit here, sent down by the Lord as exalted in heaven, was to be marked by the same principle; there was involved in His presence the administration of all the wealth of heaven. It was an administration. We have to distinguish between administration and government. The coming down of the Spirit was an administration; it involved the wealth of heaven being brought here. So there was a dispensation; what is called the dispensation of God; that in which things are dispensed according to God, and that in His house. For while God dispenses His bounty through Christ, it is immediately by the Spirit in His house. It is said further that the dispensation of God is in faith; @1 Timothy 1: 4.
I have read the verses in Matthew 18 because they indicate how this is worked out in a day such as ours, when that which had boasted of being the divine system has become corrupt. The Lord, having spoken
{377}
of the assembly in the earlier verses, uses the word 'again' in verse 19, meaning it was a new subject, or the same subject in another development. The assembly in the previous verses is regarded as intact, as that which was to be heard, and woe to him who refuses to hearken to it. But in the verse I have read (verse 19) the Lord says, "Again I say to you", as if to introduce a new development, and make provision for it; for there are no afterthoughts with God. Provision is made at the outset for every contingency; the breakdown of the assembly as a public body is provided for in these two verses, so that saints should not be hampered, but that the divine thought at the outset should be still operative. Hence the Lord brings the thing down to "two of you", that is to say, not any two believers, but two of the assembly. Now Matthew, as some of you will have observed, deals in twos; where the other evangelists in parallel passages speak of one, he usually speaks of two. He had in view the breakdown of the world-system, that was opposed to God, that had its centre in Jerusalem. It was a combination; the strength of the world lies in combination. Organised opposition is the most effective opposition to God, and so at Babel from the very earliest times, the world became organised, and from Babel onwards organised opposition was most damaging, and it is so still. But God met it by an organisation of His own, and Matthew introduces that. You find Matthew dealing with two demoniacs, with two blind men, and instead of one ass he presents to us an ass and a colt, and so he deals with two of the assembly. Two of the assembly are the most important that can be found in the whole of the universe outside of divine Persons -- "two of you".
I desire that we may rightly estimate the value, potentially at least, of two of the assembly; and so Matthew brings forward the Lord's words in regard of them; He says that if there be unity, if there be
{378}
agreement, two of the assembly shall receive from heaven anything they ask. There is no limit according to this passage to what may be received and obtained from heaven by two of the assembly who are agreed. Our resources as of the assembly, as agreed, and as praying, are limitless. Our way can never be shut up locally, or generally, while there is agreement on the part of those who are of the assembly, even of two; and this explains how the reign of grace, the operations of grace, can be effective in these last days.
Now I say that before I proceed to Ezekiel, because it is of no real use to bring before you such a passage as Ezekiel save as in some sense it has a present application. We are entitled to speak of things, of which the application is entirely future, but one prefers to bring in what is of present application, and so the administration of the things in heaven being set up in Matthew, I can proceed to Ezekiel to show how that can be effective in two of the assembly as agreed, for everything is given of the "Father who is in the heavens"; whatever they ask shall come to them. God makes it evident that it is in regard of *them*; and then again, "where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of *them*". Notice the emphasis on the pronouns as calling attention to those who are of the assembly, those who seek to walk in the light of it, and are making operative what marked the assembly at the outset; so He says, "There am I in the midst of *them*".
In Ezekiel, as you will observe, the house is in view. Much is said about it in the chapters immediately preceding. You will remember that the prophet was brought into "the land of Israel" (@Ezekiel 40:2), and set upon a very high mountain, and he sees the frame of a city toward the south; all very auspicious, portending blessing in the way of rule and light from God; but
{379}
as he arrives at the place, it is not the city that is enlarged upon but the house; for it is house-wise that the blessing comes. The city will have its place by-and-by; we recognise it, but God is dealing at the present time house-wise, and so the prophet is engaged with the house, and not an empty one.
The God of Israel comes in from the east, and enters the house; His glory fills it. But now, having that in view, the prophet is shown it, he is taken to it, and its aspect is eastward. We have to learn to take account of the points of the compass spiritually; the aspect of the house is eastward. The existence of the house of God here at the present time is provisional; for us it continues unto the coming of the Lord. We do not read of the house of God in heaven, it has a provisional existence here; it continues unto the coming of the Lord. It looks eastward. It is set up here according to God, according to wisdom, for "Wisdom hath built her house" (@Proverbs 9:1); it is in every way fitted to be the vessel of divine administration, and it points on and looks for the coming of the Lord; therefore the aspect is towards the east. It is "until he come" (@Ezekiel 21:27), and what we find is that the waters flow out. There is nothing barren, nor dried up about the house of God. It is to be the source of everything of God in a provisional way, all coming down from heaven in the gift of the Spirit; for the Spirit of God came down once, and He has remained here. There were not two outpourings of the Spirit, it was one event; what occurred at Pentecost was not repeated. The Holy Spirit involves the presence of God Himself here, and thus everything operates house-wise, so the waters flow out from the right side of the house.
In order that we might be duly affected by what it cost Christ in order that the waters should flow, the Spirit of God tells us that they flow from the south side of the altar; that is to say, the death of Christ
{380}
in its results is favourable to man; and then, lest we should forget the sufferings of Christ that the altar involves -- sufferings untold -- the prophet is led round by the way of the gate towards the *north*, as if to be reminded of the awful blast of divine wrath that was directed against the Lord, our sacrifice, as on that altar. As we enjoy the results of it, it is well to be reminded of the cost. The north -- the bitter, cold wind from the north -- refers to the judgment of God. We are to be reminded that what we enjoy cost Christ the bearing of divine wrath; that sobers us. And so from that Ezekiel is led round towards the front of the house, which looketh towards the east, and the waters issue from the right side. We have had the south side, now it is the right side of the house. It is one thing for God to be favourable to us, but it is another thing for Him to use all His *power* for our help and blessing; and so it is that Pentecost was not only the indication of the favourable attitude of the administration, which it was, but God said virtually, 'In all my power I am for man'. It was the right side of the house. And so the river is flowing.
And then the Spirit of God occupies us with its increasing depth. There is no allusion to tributaries in these symbols; nor is it a question of draining the land; it is the pure, holy source that is specially in view, and then the increasing depth. The Holy Spirit came down from heaven; there was nothing here to add to Him. He brought everything with Him. What comes to light in the river is its increasing depth. Take any other system in the world professing to be religious, and examine it, you will find nothing like this. Instead of drying up and becoming evaporated by the eastern sun, this river increases as it flows until it becomes waters to swim in, a river that cannot be passed over. How we Christians understand it! What a sense of victory we have in confronting present opposition; we know
{381}
we are in that which is beyond the opposers; we know they are dealing with surface methods. We have to do with what is impossible to nature; it is waters to swim in, a river that cannot be passed over. I wonder if the young believers here understand the depth of it, what there is in it; there is more in it than you can ever take in. You may question and criticise, but you go in for it, and you will see it has a depth beyond you. It is more than enough for you; deliverance is in it. Those who have learnt to swim in it are delivered, and they discover that it deepens as it goes.
Having thus referred to the features of Christianity as indicated at Pentecost, I want to show you a little of its results, because we want results, and Matthew 18 shows these are possible even in a day like ours -- a day of small things; and what you find is that the river has banks. The prophet is taken to the banks of the river, and on the banks are trees. Banks allude to limitations; not that the Holy Spirit is to be limited, but they indicate where the river flows. I have no doubt they allude to the doctrines of Christianity; we must not be defective in doctrine, while dealing with the positive thing, that which produces life; we must be regulated. Paul says, "*thou* hast been thoroughly acquainted with my teaching" @2 Timothy 3:10. In his teaching we have indicated what the things are, where the Holy Spirit is, where divine things are; and in connection with the banks you have trees, which is, as I apprehend it, men developed; they have grown there. We need men. The Corinthians had not arrived at that; the banks were hardly visible at Corinth, they were well nigh obliterated. The apostle had to write in order to establish them, that it might be known where the river flows; it has its own way. So he says, "Brethren, be not children in your minds, but in malice be babes; but in your minds be grown men" @1 Corinthians 14:20. I fear they were more developed in malice, in the
{382}
fruits of the flesh, than they were in the graces of Christ; and so he urges upon them to be men in their minds. Ephesians goes further; ministry is to the end that we should arrive "at the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ" @Ephesians 4:13.
Now one finds gatherings where banks are hardly discernible, and there are no men, no trees. What is needed are the trees; not indeed out of proportion, as with the blind man according to Mark who saw men "as trees, walking" (@Mark 8:24); they were out of proportion in his mind. Trees are used to symbolise men as in growth; and I believe local growth is of the greatest importance -- that there should be those who are developed into manhood, who can be seen, who have distinctness.
The Spirit of God comes back to the thought of trees -- men; having mentioned them in verse 7, we have them again in verse 12, so as to develop more fully what He has in His mind with regard to them -- that they should bear fruit, that there should be variety, that they should be evergreen. These ideas of fruitfulness, of freshness, of the energy of life are to be seen in men -- in the trees. How lovely is the picture! Scripture enlarges on it elsewhere. I only dwell on it here as the outcome typically of the operations of grace, connected with the Spirit of God, within certain doctrinal limitations. I believe that what is needed in the gatherings of the Lord's people is just this growth; a growth from the babe-state into the state of manhood; and not simply that we are men in our minds, having the right thought of everything, but that there should be that holy state, that fruitfulness, that evergreenness, which is delightful to God, and refreshing to man.
You will all remember the first evidences of life in the creation according to Genesis 1, where the earth was to bring forth grass, then "fruit-trees yielding
{383}
fruit after their kind, the seed of which is in them, on the earth" @Genesis 1:11. The grass symbolises greenness and freshness, whereas the trees refer to personal distinctness; then "the seed of which is in them", means the power for continuance, power for propagation with no admixture. That which is propagated is of the same order as that from which it has sprung. It is typically an outgrowth from Christ. The believer is to be here thus; whatever propagation there is, it must be according to Christ. The seed is in itself, to be of its own kind. These trees on the banks of the river, I believe, allude to this growth; nourishment from Christ in the power of the Spirit produces men who are fruitful according to God.
Ezekiel is not occupied with officialism; with him it is a question of the river, a question of life, a question of the power of God; indeed his name signifies that -- the 'strength of God'. This is brought about by the nourishment of the Spirit known within these bounds; it produces those who in their minds are grown men; they have doctrine, that is verse 7, and in verse 12 they are spiritual, fruitful. The fruit of the Spirit is there, and with the life there is freshness.
Wherever the river came there was life; that is the test of what is of God. It says in verse 9, "And it shall come to pass that every living thing which moveth, whithersoever the double river shall come, shall live. And there shall be a very great multitude of fish; for these waters shall come thither, and the waters of the sea shall be healed; and everything shall live whither the river cometh". One might speak much about this river in its prophetic character. I have no doubt the river of God, coming out from God, from Jerusalem, will affect the east. Christianity is flowing toward the west, but the east is in the mind of God; He has not forgotten it. More than a third of the population of the world is in the east; God has not forgotten that, He will take account of the
{384}
east in due course. We may thank Him that the river of Christianity has come westward.
Prophetically this chapter in Ezekiel alludes to God's gracious dealings in the east. Wonderful times await that quarter of the earth, but I am speaking of the chapter as part of "every Scripture" (@2 Timothy 3:16) which is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable "for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness" @2 Timothy 3:16. So this scripture is most useful, as showing that professors are unresponsive to the Spirit unless there is life. Wherever the waters come, anything that has life lives, it does not die. Whatever is of God in the world, as coming into contact with them is made to live. So we may easily determine whether God is working in us, and through us. Are things in our readings living? Is our ministry producing life? Is our service producing life? Otherwise we are not supported by God. The energy of the Spirit of God in us leads to life. Wherever anything lives and comes into contact with the river, it lives, that is to say, it does not die; so that the outlook and concern of the Christian is to see what God is doing within his radius, so that through him these blessed waters should flow, and that what they come into contact with should be made to live. The word to the prophet is, "Shall these bones live?" @Ezekiel 37:3. That is Ezekiel, and they do live. God works with us; the waters flow out house-wise, and wherever they flow we may reckon upon it there is life, and thus instead of the things of God dying out, they are made to live and to continue.
One is exercised about these things in view of living conditions; first, that there should be men who are men in their minds, who have right doctrine, who have the mind of God, and who correspondingly are living, are spiritual, have spiritual affections, and are fruitful; and then too as to the general result, that wherever the waters come, there is life, and thus
{385}
the things of God do not perish. It is not that anything of God ever dies, but there is a danger of those who have life becoming like the world around them. Bring the water to them. Let us be exercised that the water through us should come to them, so that instead of dying they should live. It is the time of life-giving. This dispensation is not yet finished. God remains what He was; Christ remains what He was; the assembly remains what it was in principle; so we still have the dispensation. Let us see to it that Christianity is operative, that the presence of the Holy Spirit is operative, and this will eventuate in life.
{386}
SPIRITUAL WEALTH
@2 Corinthians 8:1 - 9; @Titus 3:5; @Deuteronomy 26:1 - 11
I have in mind to speak about wealth, that which as known in material things men of the world strain after, not indeed so much because of itself, but because of what can be acquired with it; whereas that which the Christian thinks of is spiritual. I wish to speak of the latter, mainly in its ability as qualifying us for approach to God, but I wish also to speak of it as qualifying us for divine representation in this world.
What I would desire first of all to dwell upon is the passage in 2 Corinthians, connected as it is with material giving on the part of the saints, for whilst wealth through material things has become defiled, called indeed the "mammon of unrighteousness" (@Luke 16:9), yet in the hands of the Christian, as held in relation to God, it becomes sanctified, for "every creature of God is good" (@1 Timothy 4:4), and there can be no wealth apart from the creatures of God. The believer regards them as from God, and what comes to him through them he holds normally in relation to God; and so they become sanctified, and may, indeed, become the very expression of divine love operative in him. Those who bore the bounty given by the saints for the relief of the poor are regarded in this epistle as messengers of assemblies, Christ's glory; @2 Corinthians 8:23.
In what I have to say, therefore, I am in no wise disparaging what may be in the hands of the saints in a material way, as held in relation to God and used for the promotion of His interests at the present time, but the riches spoken of in the verses I read are not these. Material things perish in the handling, whereas the riches which God has in His mind for us are
{387}
durable, imperishable; and it is of these that I desire to speak at this time.
Whilst recognising fully the value, relatively, of material things as used for the Lord, we have always to remember the warning to those who are, or would be, rich, that whilst riches may be honourably used for God, as they were in the case of Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a rich man, yet it is to be noted that the Lord was with him in *His death* -- not in His life. He was "with the rich in his death" (@Isaiah 53:9) -- a very solemn reminder of the relative value of riches. They were useful in that case to procure the tomb; it was the fulfilment of prophecy, and it is a very remarkable reference to the use of riches in a material sense, but nevertheless the word is that He was "with the rich in his death" @Isaiah 53:9. The death of Christ, beloved, in no sense enhances the riches of this world, possessed by whomsoever; the death of Christ signifies the end of them; they can go so far and no farther; useful at His burial, they have nothing to do with His resurrection.
As I said, therefore, I would desire to speak about the spiritual, the durable riches, those which set us up before God, and what is to be noted is that the Lord Jesus had to become poor in order that we might be rich; not surely that we might be rich in this world's goods, for thousands and millions of people had been rich in these before He died, before He became poor. There was a man who had been rich, of whom indeed He Himself speaks in a most touching manner. One came to Him saying, "Teacher, speak to my brother to divide the inheritance with me" @Luke 12:13. What inheritance? Not the inheritance of God, but some property that had come down to them both from their forefathers. The Lord had nothing to do with that. He was not here in connection with that. "Who established me as a judge or a divider over you?" (@Luke 12:14) the Lord replies, and then He
{388}
speaks the parable about the rich man whose riches had increased, the ground having yielded plentifully for him. How much would enter into the Lord's mind as He thought of God and the earth, and as He spoke of the ground -- the ground that had come up out of the waters of death, the ground which at His command brought forth fruit -- the grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit-tree yielding fruit; and that man had gained the profit of it. But what was all that when He had to fall into it and die? And so He speaks witheringly about the rich man; his soul should be required of him that night. He was not rich towards God. The Lord came that man might be rich towards God. We are reckoned in heaven as rich, beloved, on these lines, not according to our financial ratings in the commercial world. The question is, what are our ratings in heaven? There are ratings there; men are taken account of as rich according to their spiritual wealth Godward; and so the Lord, as it says here, became poor. I need not speak of His wealth before He became man, and even after He became man, for all that was of God came down to Him. Being the Son, everything that was of God in the creation came to Him; He was the Heir, and being also the Son of man, all that belonged to man from God came to Him -- He was the Heir of all.
But He became poor. One would love to be able to depict the poverty of Christ! Can we understand it? How His bones stuck out, as He says; instead of being clothed in His own fat, He felt His leanness as in His vicarious position before God. He became poor. It is for each of us to look into the word and understand the poverty that He entered into and to feed upon the holy food which is involved in it, and to note that it was that we might be rich: "That ye by his poverty might be enriched".
Before proceeding to Deuteronomy I want to speak
{389}
briefly of certain features of spiritual riches which God would have appear in us. First there is faith. I shall only touch on one or two features. James speaks of certain who were poor in "the world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom" @James 2:5. "Rich in faith" involves that I take in richly the light presented to me in Christ, that I am not living according to sight, that I am not looking at seen things at all, but that I am apprehending the things of God in Christ; in other words, that I am in another world. I am laying hold of God, I am laying hold of His power, of His love, of His counsels, and I am resting in regard of everything on what has come out in Christ on the part of God. Apart from these things there is no definiteness in us at all, nor any moral power in our words, in our walk, or in our ways. We are to walk by faith, to walk in the light of the mind of God, of the power of God, of the love of God, of the counsels of God, and as knowing that I am included in the counsels of God. I am living in a divine unseen system instead of a system that is seen.
I pass on to another feature, and that is what the apostle speaks of as marking the Corinthians in what I may call a semi-objective way -- they were enriched, he says, in all knowledge and word of doctrine; @1 Corinthians 1:5. 1 do not say that the Corinthians were *characterised* by these, but the presence of the Holy Spirit in them had brought all that to light -- in everything, it says, they were enriched in Christ, in all knowledge and in all word of doctrine according as the testimony of the Christ was confirmed in them, so that they came behind in no gift.
Now I want to dwell for a moment on these two features -- all knowledge and word of doctrine. At the present time the world is full of teaching, full of books, full of theories. What is called science is simply knowledge. It is the same word. But what you will find in it is the absence of finality, the
{390}
absence of definiteness. One would wish that the Lord's people, as possessing the Spirit come down from heaven, should be marked by definiteness, by knowledge, by finality, that is to say, that they know something, and that they are not dependent upon what man has said, or upon theory, but that there may be, as the Lord says, something of "We speak that which we know" @John 3:11. I do verily believe that the Lord would impress upon us the importance of definiteness in what we believe, in what we say, in what we profess to know, so that there should be the word of doctrine amongst us, and that as we come together there should be something definite. It is surely not the Lord's mind that there should be the absence of help of this kind, that there should be poverty amongst us. The apostle says to Titus that God has shed the Holy Spirit upon us richly. If the Holy Spirit has been poured out on us richly, why should there be poverty?
The saints are to be enriched in all knowledge and word of doctrine, so our Bible readings should be simple, dignified, and take on a spiritual intelligence. Nothing can ever come out of discussion. You will remember that when the Lord came down from the mount of Transfiguration the disciples were in a discussion. The scribes were discussing with them -- there was a sort of controversy, but nothing in it! A poor man had come with a child who had a demon, and he says to the Lord, "I have brought to thee my son ... I spoke to thy disciples, that they might cast him out, and they could not". It is a question of being able to help. "O unbelieving generation", He says, "how long shall I bear with you?" @Mark 9:17 - 20. If the Holy Spirit has been poured upon us richly, why should we be in poverty? It is a want of industry, a want of drawing from the right source, so that there should be knowledge and the word of doctrine and
{391}
thus the testimony of the Christ confirmed; that is to say, we understand, we know, we are sure that what we hold is the truth. Hence it says, "If any one speak". How is he to speak? Is it a theory? There are no hypotheses at all amongst the people of God. "If any one speak -- as oracles of God" @1 Peter 4:11. If the testimony of the Christ is confirmed, why not speak as the oracles of God? Now this is an important matter; for if the meetings are to be profitable and attractive, there must be that which is governed by knowledge, by spiritual intelligence and by word of doctrine, conveying the thought that the testimony of the Christ is confirmed in us.
Now I refer to another thing, namely, richness in good works. We are to be "rich in good works" @1 Timothy 6:18. The need around us is very great, and to be representative of God there must be something of this nature; if there is to be any testimony it must be according to what shone in Christ. It is said of Him that He "went through all quarters doing good ... because God was with him" @Acts 10:38. I have no doubt that the good works spoken of in Ephesians which God has prepared that we should walk in them, refer to the works that shone in Christ. If the assembly is to be the fulness of Christ, the expression of Christ here, there must be something in the way of good works, and these are to be taken up as an obligation. I do not understand simply giving what may be put in the box, as we speak, as answering to good works. What I understand by good works is a reckoning as to the need, a taking account of the need and meeting it to the utmost of our ability. If thy brother hunger you must feed him; if he thirst, you must give him drink. How dwells the love of God in him who disregards a hungry or a naked brother? You must take account of his hunger and his nakedness and meet them; the divine thought in Christ is to meet the need. "Good
{392}
works, which God has before prepared that we should walk in them" @Ephesians 2:10. And if we are rich, we shall. We are to be rich in them; and to be rich in them, we must have riches; and God has shed forth the Spirit richly that there should be nothing lacking of these features among His people.
I want to go on now to Deuteronomy, because what I have in mind is what is due to God. If we are to worship God and carry out the service of God in the sanctuary, the entrance to which is thrown open to us, we must go in by the priest. "We have such a one high priest who has sat down on the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens" (@Hebrews 8:1), and it goes on to say that, being a high priest, He must have something to offer; in other words, He must have means. The point there is not what He offered, but that He had something to offer. There were infinite riches in Christ; there was nothing lacking in Him, I need not say, as to the service of God; it was met in every way. Hence in Hebrews 9 we have what is called the "eternal inheritance" @Hebrews 9:15. The way into the sanctuary is indicated, but who are to go in? We go in by the priest, by the new and living way, but then, who is to go in? Those who are possessed of the eternal inheritance. Now I wish you particularly to notice this, because the service of God in Scripture is made to depend on the wealth of the saints; not that they can be a source in themselves, surely, for whatever we have is from God. He has shed upon us abundantly the means of wealth, and so you find in the book of Exodus that the very material of the sanctuary came from the people, and then too in regard of the temple the *abundance* came from the people. All the material came from the people. Hence, in Hebrews 9, as I said, we have an "eternal inheritance" (@Hebrews 9:15), and in @Ephesians 1:14 the Spirit is said to be the earnest of it, so that in possession of the inheritance we have means.
{393}
We do not appear before God empty. The possession of the inheritance furnishes us with the means. In Deuteronomy the males were to appear before God thrice in the year and in no case was any male in Israel to appear on those occasions empty. He was to come with something in his hands.
Now I believe that God looks for this in the most practical way. He looks for a state marked by a certain amount of wealth amongst His people; so that in coming to Him in the light of the sanctuary, in the light of the new and living way, we come there with *something*, we come with some measure of spiritual wealth, and hence the inheritance, the eternal inheritance, of which the Holy Spirit is the earnest. Thus the believer is enriched, he is enabled to draw near to God with something in his hands. Is it so with us? Is it so that every believer nominally in fellowship has accepted the obligation of drawing near to God with something in his hands -- some wealth? This is a very searching question.
You see an Israelite, for instance, coming down from Dan, which was a long way to Jerusalem. His land may not have been so fertile as the land on the plain by the Mediterranean, but, nevertheless, he comes down all those miles to Jerusalem. He arrives at Jerusalem; his mind is to draw near to God, to worship God. He has got that in his mind all the way down and he arrives at Jerusalem. The priest is there, the temple is there, the way in is plain, but what has he got? He goes in by the gate of the temple, but if he has got nothing in his hands, there is no place for him! The priest is not there to look after an empty-handed worshipper, he is there to take what he has got in his hands. He may as well have stayed at home, he has added nothing to Jerusalem, he has brought nothing. The command was that he was not to go empty. Have we ever taken that home to ourselves? It is a command to us, that we are not to
{394}
appear before God empty. Another man comes from Beersheba; he has a good farm, he has been prosperous; he may drive some cattle before him, or he may take money in his bag -- sell his cattle at Beersheba and buy others at Jerusalem. He has got means, he arrives at Jerusalem, he buys his sacrifice -- his bullock or his sheep, or his goat, or whatever it may be; he draws near to the priest; he is accepted. He has added to what is there. There is food for God there and there is food for the priest.
Do you see how the thing stands? God has not changed. These things were written for us, and if we draw near to God we must have something to offer. This man contemplated in Deuteronomy 26 has entered upon the inheritance; that is the secret of it. It says, "When thou comest into the land that Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest it, and dwellest therein" -- that is the secret. You have entered on the inheritance by the Spirit, you have taken possession of it by the Spirit, and you dwell in it. You are living in the light of the mind of God for you, in the light of the purpose of His love, you are enjoying it by the Spirit, you are enjoying these holy features, and you are growing rich, and immediately you fill your basket with firstfruits. The firstfruits signify the freshest; the very best and most spiritual thoughts you have are put together. The most energetic affections you have are all brought together and you come to God, and you give; you are occupied for the moment with what you have got, not with what others may have when you get there. And now you give, and you give it to the priest, which indicates that God has to be approached, not simply by a wealthy person, but by a holy person, for we must have holiness. True enough, our great High Priest, Christ, is there, but nevertheless we draw near to God as priests ourselves -- a holy priesthood, it says, to offer up spiritual sacrifices,
{395}
acceptable to God by Jesus Christ; and we set down the basket.
Now the basket is yourself. The woman of Samaria got the idea from Christ; she understood that she was to be a vessel, and so it carries right through that the believer is himself a vessel -- a vessel of mercy. What he had been is another matter. He says, "A perishing Aramaean was my father". He knows fully what he had been, but then he goes on to speak about his exercises. How did the change come about? God works through a moral process, and the change came about by the sense he had of the oppression of the Egyptians. He began to feel it, and in the oppression he spoke to God; he began to be a priest then, although he did not know it, for we begin to be priests when we speak to God. In truth, the believer begins to acquire wealth as he learns to speak to God. As a new-born babe he desires the sincere milk of the word, and he grows by it. I would speak for the encouragement of any young people here -- that you begin to put by a little wealth by thus feeding on the pure mental milk of the word, and you add to it until you become wealthy; you get fresh joys, the firstfruits, and you draw near to God with these in your basket. How fresh you are! Inside are all these precious thoughts of God by the Spirit -- the precious thoughts of the inheritance, and so as you sit down in the meeting, you are full of life and energy, only waiting your opportunity to give expression to them in a priestly way. It may be through others, but it is from you, that is the point; you have brought your basket and the priest will take account of it and use it; he will use what you bring. You are the basket -- the vessel of mercy "prepared for glory" (@Romans 9:23), and withal a holy vessel, as David says, "the vessels of the young men are holy", @1 Samuel 21:5. We are to possess our vessels in sanctification so that when we appear before God we are usable; our
{396}
basket is there and the contents are full of Christ, full of precious thoughts about God, and about Christ, and about the inheritance. What rich meetings we should have if all present were filled thus! And so the service of God is to be continued, not in the poverty of mere threadbare expressions, but in the richness of a full basket of firstfruits. Whence came they? From the inheritance you have entered on, and possess, and dwell in, and you are accepted. Thus the work of God and the worship of God proceed, and God is glorified in His people.
In the closing verse I read it says, "thou shalt rejoice in all the good that Jehovah thy God hath given to thee, and to thy house, thou, and the Levite, and the stranger that is in thy midst". God has His portion now and you get yours. You rejoice in every good thing that He gives you. You see how happy, and free, and dignified the spiritual man is; he thinks of the Levite, the minister that ministers the truth to him, and the stranger; he is like God.
And so it is that the Lord would help us to understand the riches that He intended for us, that which was in His mind for us when He became poor, that through His poverty we might be rich.
{397}
WHO DO YE SAY THAT I AM?
@Mark 8:22 - 38; @Mark 9:1 - 9
J.T. I think it is well to note that the point of the Lord's question to His disciples, "Who do ye say that I am?" is not connected so much with what they believed, as with what they *said*, and it appears that the incident at Bethsaida was preparatory to this, so that one might know how to speak about the Lord. It seems as if we need to have our eyes opened for this. There are two lines in regard to the Person of Christ; one is what is publicly *declared*, and the other is what is revealed personally. The opening of our eyes would be to see what is set out in the way of public evidence of what Christ is; revelation is more intimate and personal, as we see in Peter (@Matthew 16). Men were saying certain things as to who Christ was; this was occasioned by His miracles and teaching.
H.E.F. Do you mean that revelation is an advance on declaration?
J.T. Yes, I think so; the declaration is public.
H.E.F. Will you say a little more as to the distinction between those two thoughts?
J.T. In Romans it says, "Marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of the dead" (@Romans 1:4) -- or dead ones. That is public witness. But Peter, as we have said had a revelation: "Flesh and blood has not *revealed* it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens" (@Matthew 16:17); and Paul had a revelation also: "God ... was pleased", he says, "to reveal his Son in me", @Galatians 1:15,16.
H.E.F. Do you mean that it should be an exercise with us as to whether we have received this revelation?
{398}
J.T. I think so. There is that which is for all -- the public testimony, and then there is too that which is personal and intimate. The resurrection of the dead and other miracles are public; the private side is on the line of revelation as in the case of Peter and Paul.
F.H.B. Would you say that the scripture in Matthew 11 would support that: "No one knows the Son but the Father, nor does any one know the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son may be pleased to reveal him" @Matthew 11:27?
J.T. Just so. What is public is to be seen, and so the necessity for the opening of our eyes.
J.A.P. What is the significance of the second touch in regard to the opening of the eyes?
J.T. In our case it would be the Spirit known in us by which we discern everything. It says, he "saw all things clearly". No one sees all things clearly save he who recognises the Spirit. "All things" would involve what has come out in the way of testimony. First he sees men, but he sees them "as trees, walking". Evidently he had a very distorted view of things, and that indicates, I suppose, that the reason why many of the people of God have a distorted view of things is that they have not received the second touch.
Ques. Does it suggest a need of adjustment?
J.T. Yes. The Lord laid His hands again upon his eyes. It is a second service, or ministry, which I think many of us need. The evidence of this need is the distorted and unproportionate way in which we look at things.
Ques. Would the second touch suggest the Spirit's movement?
J.T. It would; it is the Lord's work. The Lord touched his eyes.
H.E.F. How would you distinguish between the first touch and the second?
{399}
J.T. I think the first, touch expressed the Lord's sympathy with the person who was blind. "They bring him a blind man"; it does not say who brought him. It shows there was general sympathy with him, which I think the Lord would promote among His people, and indeed the spirit of sympathetic interest in those who are needy should always be amongst His own. Then, further, we read that they "beseech him that he might touch him"; there is solicitude for the man. This side should be emphasised among the people of God -- solicitude for those in need. I have no doubt that if we kept these things in view, there would be blessing and help among us.
H.E.F. There would be the desire to bring those in need to the Lord.
J.T. The influence of the town is prejudicial to the service that He intended to render to the man at this particular juncture, so He took him by the hand. "Taking hold of the hand of the blind man he led him forth out of the village". Note that He took him by the hand, then it says, "and having spit upon his eyes, he laid his hands upon him". Thus the man is made to feel at the outset that the Lord was a real Man. It suggests "the man, Christ Jesus" @1 Timothy 2:5.
H.E.F. Would the proof of His humanity be in the spittle?
J.T. The spittle stands for the genuineness of the Lord's humanity, "Having spit upon his eyes, he laid his hands upon him"; so there is in the service rendered a complete committal. We see first the Lord's consideration in leading him outside the town because of the prejudicial influence of the town, and then His humanity. These features, I believe, should come out in the gospel presented to those around. He was a real Man, and then He identifies Himself with the blind man, He lays His hands upon him. Then the Lord asked him if he beheld anything,
{400}
because the effect of the ministry of Christ is seen in what we say in answer to His question.
H.E.F. Do you think the Lord in laying His hands upon him had in view that the man should answer to His own thought?
J.T. I think so. It was a question of eyesight, and the answer we make to the questions put to us brings out the effect of the ministry of Christ.
H.T. What answers to the village now?
J.T. It is the *organised* system around us. The world is marked by organisation. It has been a feature from the beginning; the first town built by Cain introduced the principle of organisation, a principle which was to render the world more powerful and more independent of God. In that sphere all that man is, all his ability and his power, come out. Next we find a city and a tower is built -- I refer to Babel -- and so all down the history of humanity the principle of building a city is to enhance man's position on earth as independent of God, and that principle enters into the smallest town and village in the world. So that while the Lord proves His perfect humanity, He leads the man outside of all the sphere of man's influence. God intends to lead that man into another world, and so his eyes are opened and he begins to see things clearly.
Ques. What does Bethsaida represent?
J.T. I think it represents what is nominally evangelical. It is a city with a reputation, for it was "the city of Andrew and Peter" (@John 1:44); Philip also was of it. It is all the more dangerous spiritually on account of being whitewashed in this way.
W.S. After the second touch the Lord directs the man to look up. What is the point of that?
J.T. That is a mistranslation. It may be there, but it is doubtful. In the first case the man looked up -- that was instinctive. The natural tendency is to
{401}
look down. Then it says the Lord laid His hands upon him again, and "he saw distinctly, and was restored and saw all things clearly".
E.M.L. You were suggesting that many of us need the second touch, and the evidence is that we do not appear to see things clearly.
J.T. What is needed is what the Lord effects for us by the Spirit; and we do not see things in their right relation and proportion until this point is reached. Until then we are not fit to take part in the assembly, or in the service of the Lord.
E.R. Were the Corinthians seeing men like trees walking?
J.T. Just so; they were making much of certain ones. Evidently though Paul and Apollos are mentioned, others were being looked up to as leaders out of proportion to their spiritual stature (see @1 Corinthians 4:6).
E.M.L. Have you any thought as to the difference between seeing men and seeing things?
J.T. Things are more general; they would imply what is set out -- not only men, but principles. They are not to be divorced, of course. What you get recorded in Acts 2 about the three thousand in Jerusalem is that "They persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles" @Acts 2:42. It was not merely that there were followers of certain men, nor that they were simply added to the apostles, but the believers continued steadfastly in their doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread and prayers. They had laid hold of principles. If the apostles were taken away the principles would remain and the believers would go on with them, and they did so, too. If Christianity was dependent upon the presence of the apostles, it would have died with them, but it was not. The apostles introduced the doctrine, fellowship, etc., and these were continued in, as understood, by the saints.
E.M.L. We should be able to see in the doctrine
{402}
the things connected with the kingdom and the assembly.
J.T. Just so. Now men were saying things, and the Lord assumes His disciples would know what men were saying about Him, and *we* should know, as disciples, what men are saying about the Lord.
H.E.F. What is involved in sending the man whose eyes were opened to his house? What would answer to that today for us?
J.T. Instead of going to the town the convert is sent to his house. If it be a young convert it is the safe place for him, and hence the importance of having households, affording safety and wholesome influences, having the features of the house of God.
F.H.B. I suppose oftentimes young converts go back to the village and get under its influence.
J.T. I am sure that is what is happening. The habits of this world are taken up by those who believe, and they come under the influence of them.
H.T. The man out of whom the legion was cast in chapter 5 is sent to his home and his own people. What is the difference?
J.T. The man in that chapter is sent home to tell what was done for him. In this case the Lord sent the man to his house, saying, "Neither enter into the village, nor tell it to any one in the village". It is to avoid Christianising the village. It is not of God to nominally Christianise a community. Modern Christendom is the result of this practice. The village would of course take credit for the occurrence and would talk of it as an item of news. In this way the Lord would become owned outwardly. We learn elsewhere (@John 6) that the people were ready to make Him king because of the signs He wrought.
F.H.B. If the house is under the control of the Lord it would be a safe place.
J.A.P. Do you think the Lord gives the second
{403}
touch as a matter of course, or is it obtained as a result of the necessity being felt for it?
J.T. The Lord's first question would make the need for it apparent; hence what you are concerned about is to find out by questions the state the saints are in.
H.E.F. Do you mean that this man would be in a condition to answer the questions in the next incident?
J.T. That is what the Lord is leading up to.
H.E.F. We need to be outside the village conditions and to have our eyes opened to apprehend the glory of His Person.
J.T. You do not want to add to the village. Christianity has added to this world. It was never the divine intent that the world should be white-washed by Christianity. That is what the Lord has in His mind. His injunction to the man to go to his house would provide against that, it would also tend to save himself from the influence of the town.
T.E.W. Is your thought that this incident is connected with the declaration?
J.T. Yes; as having his eyes open, the man would see what was presented in Christ, and so could answer the Lord's question as to who He was.
H.E.F. You would only value men according to their estimate of Christ. Your thought is that we should recognise men in this way?
J.T. You begin to see that in the house, not in the village. A man would appear in a village according to the estimate of the village, according to the principles governing the town. I think in a Christian house what man is naturally is not the point. With many of us there is the culture of the world, and the children are brought up on worldly principles that they may shine as others, and this is the secret of many sorrowful occurrences and departures. The spittle is to bring the *Lord's* humanity to the man's
{404}
attention. The object in view is that we are to see, not men in this world, but men according to Christ, and our homes should be governed on that principle. The connection of houses with the Lord's ministry is very interesting and instructive.
E.R. The apostle recognises certain households at Corinth as being places of safety.
J.T. He did; and he mentions Priscilla and Aquila twice as having an assembly in their house.
Ques. Would Peter's answer, "Thou art the Christ", correspond to the second touch of the blind man?
J.T. It shows that Peter saw things "clearly". In Matthew the revelation relates to the assembly; Mark does not go as far as that. He is occupied with levitical service and qualifying for that; there is no reference to the assembly. Here, too, it is a question of determining who the Lord is by clearness of vision. It is not what men believed; it was what was being *said* about the Lord. What did the disciples say?
F.H.B. Peter's confession here does not go as far as in Matthew.
H.E.F. Would "the Christ" be a man of an entirely different kind from the men in the village?
J.T. "The Christ" is the One who does things for God. That is what anyone with opened eyes can see. It is not here a question of knowing it by revelation, but by seeing what He is doing. It shows He is the Anointed of God.
F.H.B. The recognition of Him as "the Christ" would be a great step towards the further revelation in Matthew -- "the Son of the living God" @Matthew 16:16.
J.T. Matthew has the *assembly* in view, so that you have, "Flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens" @Matthew 16:17. It was a *revelation* showing who the Son of man is. But this does not go so far as that; it is a question of what
{405}
you see, what you gather up, what is presented to you in the service of Christ. All service for the Lord should be on the principle of the anointing.
W.S. This would be parallel with what we get in John's epistle: "every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ come in flesh" @1 John 4:2.
E.W.L. Do you think this leads up to the distinction between the things of men and the things of God?
J.T. The Christ is the anointed One, the One who does things for God. God carries on His work on the principle of the anointing; that is to say, He allows nothing of man's culture and development. God says virtually by the anointing, "All must be in the power of the Spirit", so what you find in Luke with regard to Simeon is that the Holy Spirit is *upon* him. Now earlier in that gospel we read of persons being *filled* with the Holy Spirit; John the baptist is spoken of in this way, and indeed, the Lord returns from Jordan "full of the Holy Spirit" (@Luke 4:1), but when you come to Simeon, the Holy Spirit is *upon* him, meaning that God commits Himself to him by what is put upon him. What is inside may not be seen, but what is upon us is visible. God commits Himself to us by the Spirit given to us.
H.E.F. Has not levitical service a great place in this gospel?
J.T. It is the great point in it. We should learn by the apprehension of Him as the Christ, and take character from that in our service. The man was enabled to see things, and to see them distinctly: "all things clearly". This is most important; ignoring it, we shall miss our way and be found serving according to human ways.
H.E.F. Thus you would not be likely to Christianise the village.
J.T. No; the village represents the world organised. What are men saying about the Lord? They are not saying, "He is the Christ". They have their
{406}
own men doing things. Every country has its own heroes -- men who have done things, who have made the country -- but "the Christ" is not working on that line. He is here the Anointed; God is committed to Him and that is the ground upon which levitical service is carried on. How serious a thing that is! God has committed Himself to me as the Holy Spirit is upon me. Everything I am doing is to be for God.
Rem. The disciples were to tell no man about Him.
J.T. It is not a question of preaching the gospel, but of telling men; the latter would only add to the world, it would assume that men can understand, whereas the gospel is "on the principle of faith to faith" @Romans 1:17.
Rem. So that true service lifts souls up out of that which is systematised.
J.T. The world as organised is left behind us. Men are to be *preached* to; that is another matter, but we must be careful about the man in the flesh -- the organised world. The idea in the gospel is to bring men into God's world, not to improve man's world. Christ is anointed, and doing things for God. In this gospel it is said, "He does all things well" @Mark 7:37.
H.E.F. Do you think what follows implies that if one is prepared to move on those lines, one must be prepared for a path of suffering?
J.T. Yes. Whilst Peter makes his confession he shows he is not prepared to go the whole way. He would spare the flesh. Sparing the flesh is a serious matter.
H.E.F. The Christ was not on that line.
J.T. No, He was not. It says that Peter began to rebuke Him. Think of that!
H.E.F. The Lord had spoken of the full length to which He was going.
{407}
J.T. In verse 31 it says, "He began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and of the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again". Notice it is not that He *says* these things merely: He *teaches* them.
H.E.F. Does that imply that we do not come to it very readily?
J.T. The instruction here is so important that the Lord exercises the power of teaching, as it were (it is a gift with us), to enforce the truth. He teaches them that He must suffer. If you carry on the service of the Lord, the suffering must be accepted. Peter would disallow this. It is what we are naturally, we tend to spare ourselves; we do not go the whole length. How serious to rebuke the Lord! When men say, "You should not go that length, you should spare yourself", that is what *they* do. And so the Lord would have His rebuke to Peter known openly.
F.H.B. It says, He "turning round and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter"; the rebuke was specially intended for *their* benefit.
J.T. I thought that. One feels in oneself the tendency to spare oneself, but the need is very great, and so sacrifice must be made.
J.B. Going back to what you have been saying about the opening of the eyes, is it that we might see what the Lord is doing now, or what He is doing in this gospel?
J.T. It is that we might see what is going on now, to get a right apprehension of it.
E.M.L. Would you say sparing ourselves is savouring of what is of men?
J.T. That is what it is. He says, "Get away behind me, Satan" -- a very strong expression. That sort of thing must be far away from the people of God.
F.H.B. There was not only the flesh acting, but
{408}
Satan using the flesh; if the flesh is allowed we give Satan a handle.
H.E.F. And it would divert us from this pathway of faith and suffering.
W.R.P. What is your thought as to the reason we get the change from "the Christ" in verse 29 to the "Son of man" in verse 31?
J.T. I think that "the Christ" would be understood by the Jews as referring to themselves, but the "Son of man" is the Lord's way of showing that what is in view now is His relation to men as such. He would suffer as the Son of man.
W.R.P. Would it show the world-wide character of the service?
J.T. Yes. In the next chapter the Lord gives a view of Himself in exaltation. Confessing by what you see involves a moral state in us. He would honour us by an exalted view.
F.H.B. You are referring to the transfiguration?
J.T. Yes; it says, "There are some of those standing here that shall not taste death until they shall have seen the kingdom of God come in power". So the thing is seen in its reality, not in a moral way -- that is down below -- but in its reality on high, in the transfiguration.
H.E.F. What do you mean by 'down below'?
J.T. Here in our ordinary circumstances. We arrive at a knowledge of the Lord by what we see, and that involves a moral state -- clearness of vision which preserves us from being governed by worldly influences. I think no one can see all things clearly who is not clear of the flesh -- its motives and influences. The chapter shows how we are led on to be able to say what is right about Christ. That is a most important thing.
E.R. The whole of chapter 8 applies to us here in natural conditions, does it not?
{409}
J.T. That is right. There is *teaching* as to suffering; it is the pathway of discipleship; whereas the transfiguration is special, on the principle of the Lord's sovereign selection and your exercise is to be in that selection.
H.E.F. Would you say that the passage "There are some of those standing here that shall not taste death until they shall have seen the kingdom of God come in power", refers to what we experience while down here?
J.T. Certainly; the question comes, Am I one of those "standing here" -- standing near the Lord?
E.R. When you refer to the selection, does it suggest a certain state in Peter, James and John?
J.T. Yes; but He does not say anything about them personally to begin with; He says, "There are *some*". Every one standing there should be exercised.
W.S. How had they qualified to be selected?
J.T. The Lord alone knows. But then the exercise comes to each of us, "Am I among them?" One would desire to be among that "some".
E.R. The Lord had to rebuke Peter, but he was among the "some".
J.T. That is very encouraging. We should have said that Peter had disqualified himself by what he said, but he had said something before that. The Lord is to be the judge. It is not left to the saints to nominate them. "After six days Jesus takes with him Peter, and James, and John".
F.H.B. There is the suggestion of the sovereign choice of the Lord in taking up these three.
J.T. No doubt there was something in them which the Lord knew, which fitted them for this great occasion.
Ques. Would the six days leave time for the development of that exercise?
J.T. Just so. In Mark we are told it was "after six days", in Luke "about eight days" (@Luke 9:28); a *weekly*
{410}
experience is in view in either record, only Luke implies more grace as to time -- a sabbath would intervene, which would be an advantage spiritually. It is the kind of exercise which comes before the Lord's day morning meeting.
E.R. During that time Peter would have had opportunity to have got the gain of the Lord's word to him.
J.T. Six days are to prepare us for a spiritual result. The seventh would be the spiritual result.
W.W.P. Is there any significance in the thought of a high mountain?
J.T. It suggests elevation. You are drawn away from the influence of the world altogether. The idea is elevation.
H.E.F. This is more than being outside the village.
J.T. You are drawn away from the world altogether by the sovereign choice of the Lord. We should connect this with the first day of the week.
H.E.F. Is this open to all?
J.T. When He says, "*Some* ... standing here", He suggests that you *may* be one of them.
H.T. He took those three.
J.T. The intent is that all might answer to it, but room is left for the Lord's selection. God's world is on the principle of His sovereign choice.
E.R. How do you connect it with the first day of the week?
J.T. The first day comes in after the six -- after six days of exercise. I think the assembly's life is made up of weeks.
Ques. John speaks of being "in the Spirit on the Lord's day" @Revelation 1:10. How do we arrive at that?
J.T. Well, I think we arrive at it by giving the Spirit His place. We see all things clearly; we are not going to allow the thing that God has condemned. We see in @Daniel 9 what self-judgment, prayer, and fasting culminate in.
{411}
H.E.F. Do you mean that this scene is the result of the previous exercise?
J.T. I do. The Lord is showing whom He would approve for this particular privilege. It is a question of privilege. He *takes* them with Him after six days. He had made the announcement; six days elapsed and then He takes with Him Peter, James and John -- He *takes* them up on a high mountain by themselves apart.
Ques. Do the six days refer to the unleavened bread of the passover?
J.T. We are *taken* up; we do not ascend. The Lord says, "I ascend" @John 20:17. Paul speaks of being "caught up" @2 Corinthians 12:2.
J.V.W. Are there some special features in regard to the three in that way?
J.T. I think so; they were taken into the house of Jairus; there must have been something that the Lord knew fitted them for this extraordinary privilege.
E.R. Does this involve the knowledge of the Son of God?
J.T. It says, "This is my beloved Son"; they heard the Father's voice. They were then in the region of divine Persons speaking. And then it says, "Suddenly having looked around, they no longer saw any one, but Jesus alone with themselves". So that you have a company now indicated, I think, that is to mark this dispensation; they *come down*.
E.R. That involves sonship.
J.T. Yes, quite.
H.E.F. Had you this in your mind when you spoke of revelation at the beginning?
J.T. Yes, I had. The education should prepare us for this; they come down. That would indicate the kind of people that gives character to the dispensation. Peter says, "We have not made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, following cleverly imagined fables, but having been
{412}
eyewitnesses of his majesty. For he received from God the Father honour and glory, such a voice being uttered to him by the excellent glory: This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight; For he received from God the Father honour and glory, such a voice being uttered to him by the excellent glory: This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight" @2 Peter 1:16 - 18.
F.H.B. This prepared them for their future service.
J.T. It did. This is the second time -- that is, after the transfiguration -- that He charges them to "tell no man"; but they are to tell them when He is risen from the dead. This is another matter. They are to tell it in the power of resurrection.
Ques. What is suggested in the voice coming out of the cloud?
J.T. It is an allusion to the tabernacle in the wilderness. The true tabernacle was there in Christ.
E.R. Would "coming down" involve taking up discipleship in a new character?
J.T. I think that what they saw and heard would give colour to the service henceforth. They were to speak of what they had seen and heard on the holy mount after He was risen, when it should be known that He had power to support their testimony, and when the new order of things, connected with the Spirit, should be established.
{413}
THE WAY OF EFFECTIVE SERVICE
@Mark 9:14 - 27; @Mark 16:1 - 20
I had in mind to speak about the continuance of effective service among the people of God. This gospel is intended to promote such service, and so it presents the Lord in this connection. "Beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ, Son of God" @Mark 1:1. Effective service can only be in servants divinely fitted and sent forth, and in order to understand the qualifications for it, we need to pay attention to what marked the Lord as presented in this gospel. As I said, He is presented as Son of God. There is no reference to genealogy, either from man to God, as in Luke, or from the roots of promise, David and Abraham, as in Matthew. He is simply introduced to us as the Son of God. He had already been declared, or "marked out" (@Romans 1:4) to be the Son of God by resurrection of the dead, but this evangelist shows that at the outset of His service the heavenly intervention was, as it were, for Himself, indicating that for service there must needs be private relations with heaven.
It will have been observed by those who have read carefully that in this gospel the opening of the heavens, the coming of the Spirit, and the announcement from heaven that He was Son of God were for Himself. It speaks of the heavens opening, and the Holy Spirit descending, and then the voice, "*Thou* art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight" (@Mark 1:11), suggesting heaven's interest, heaven's honour, and His relationship to God. In the other two synoptic gospels the incident recorded is not so personal. In Luke the Holy Spirit is said to have descended in a bodily form as a dove upon Him, but it is not said that He saw it; the announcement of the relationship
{414}
is addressed to Him, but the coming of the Spirit is not so personal. In Matthew He sees the Spirit coming, but the word there is, "*This* is my beloved Son" (@Matthew 3:17); attention is called to Him, whereas in Mark all is personal; He sees the heavens opened and the Spirit coming, and the voice is to Him. And so in aspiring to service, I think we have in Mark an indication of a necessity for a private understanding with heaven, so to speak. There is a power that comes, and you know it is upon you; others will see it presently, but *you* know it, otherwise there is no moral right to set up as representing God and Christ here. And then in addition to that there is the conscious knowledge of your relationship with God. Service can only be carried on in the dignity and liberty that belong to sonship. So I would emphasise at the outset two features with regard to what I have presented: on the one hand, that if there is to be effective service maintained, there must be the private understanding with heaven of the power and the honour conferred by the reception and anointing of the Spirit, and on the other hand, of the relationship into which we are brought.
The Lord Jesus, I would say, was Son inherently; it was no question with Him of *receiving* sonship as with us, but of the announcement by God of what was there: "Thou art my beloved Son" @Mark 1:11. With us sonship is received, as it says in Galatians 4, "When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, come of woman, come under law, that he might redeem those under law, that we might receive sonship. But because ye are sons, God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father" (@Galatians 4:4 - 6), that is to say, with the relationship conferred, the power to enjoy it is conferred, but that is in our *hearts*; it is not the same thought as the anointing. What I have in my heart is for my own enjoyment and for my own response to God as a son, but for
{415}
service it is *upon*, and so the Holy Spirit came upon them all. This has reference to the anointing -- the external evidence of divine honour conferred to represent God in this world. We should not be afraid of the idea of representation, for the primary thought of God with regard to man was that he should represent God. "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness" @Genesis 1:26. I think the reception of sonship and of the Spirit of God's Son in our hearts implies that we are to be like God, but the Holy Spirit coming upon us implies much more; we are to be representative of God in this world. It is the thought of God that He should be represented. God never intended it otherwise than that He should be represented here, and be represented in those who serve. The assembly itself is called "the Christ" in @1 Corinthians 12:12, meaning that there was to be representation here in it as anointed.
Now having said this, I have to come to the dark picture of the people of God exhibiting inability to help in spite of the greatest light and privileges. I refer to the passage in chapter 9. The early part of that chapter, as applied to saints now, supposes the Spirit. Three persons selected by the Lord are taken up into a high mountain apart, where He was transfigured before them, and where the voice of God from heaven spoke to them calling attention to Him. This was a wonderful privilege. And now He comes to His disciples and there is a great crowd around them, and He finds that the scribes are disputing with them; He makes enquiry as to what they were disputing about, and one of the crowd said, "I have brought to thee my son". Evidently he understood that he would find the Lord with His own. Is it always so, dear brethren, that He is found among us? We speak much of the Lord Jesus in the midst, but is it so that He is found among us always? He was not found amongst them here. There may be
{416}
circumstances that would forbid His presence. Are there not such circumstances found sometimes in our meetings which forbid the presence of the Lord? Thus we are disciplined or rebuked.
Here is a man in need, and evidently he assumes the Lord would be found among His own, and normally it should be so. Certainly it was not so on this occasion. The father of the child says, "I have brought to thee my son", and then he says, "I spoke to thy disciples, that they might cast him out". Alas! they were unable to cast out the demon. The disputation had gone on, but disputation is not power; what is needed to help is power, and the disciples, although they could dispute, could not cast out the demon. It says they *could not* do it. How discreditable it was, how it denied the great ministry of the Lord Jesus! If the Lord Himself had not come in, the man must have gone away without help; he had come expecting the Lord to be there -- he says, I have brought him unto *Thee*. Where should He be save among His disciples? But there is a disputation, and no power to help. Well, I speak all this so that we may take to heart any inability to help of which we may be conscious. It places us on a level in regard of service with those around us in Christendom. See the Lord's rebuke! "O unbelieving generation! how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you?" The disciples are included in this rebuke. Unless we have power to help what is it but that we resemble the world? We are like the religious world about us, and so we are condemned with it. "O *unbelieving* generation". This includes all; the disciples and the scribes would both be included in the Lord's words. They had no power to help the man. The Lord says, "Bring him to me". I need not go into detail, I only wished to touch on one point -- the inability in those known to be disciples of Christ to relieve need, to help.
{417}
We see in this incident how the impotency of the disciples being disclosed, the Lord Himself takes the matter in hand; He says, "Bring him to me", for the testimony can never fall to the ground. The Lord will always come in and adjust things by Himself; He will never let things go, you may be sure of that; He is "the faithful and true witness" @Revelation 3:14. The work will go on, the relief will be administered; the Lord will see to that.
I turn now to chapter 16, where we see the women with the best possible intent and purpose, and with love to Christ, at the sepulchre at the sun-rising, and they see there on the right side a young man. He was on the *right* side, and is clothed with a white robe. He is there as a witness to the divine requirements -- to the qualifications needed in the service of God as a young man. The Lord is looking for young men. The testimony is to go on, and He looks for young men. There is a wonderful opportunity for such at the present time; old ones necessarily pass away to be with the Lord as the dispensation continues, as it says, "One generation passeth away and another generation cometh" (@Ecclesiastes 1:4), but the generations overlap, that is to say, the old and the young have occasion to mingle. We see in Matthew that the Lord finds an ass and a colt and He rides *both*. The disciples brought them, and we read, "He sat on *them*" @Matthew 21:7. We find frequently a division between the old and the young, but it was never intended to be so. The old have experience and wisdom, the young have the energy, the life and freshness, and so the divine intention is that there should be a happy blending of both. The assembly, I may say, is made up of both old and young, and the young are not to isolate themselves from the old, nor the old from the young; they are to be held together, they are to be so together that the Lord can use both at one time. He rode upon them *both*.
In Mark it is one young man; and it is not now a
{418}
piece of cloth cast about his naked body, but a long white garment -- a robe. The idea of clothing is suggested. How often our natural nakedness shows itself by the way we allow the flesh in our fashions and deportment. Here is a young man clothed in a long white robe. He is completely covered; speaking typically, the flesh is not apparent, he has overcome it, and then there is purity suggested. These are the essentials of effective service. He is on the right side too, signifying as I understand it, that the *power* of God had become effective in the tomb. Jesus had risen from the tomb, as the young man said, "He is risen; he is not here". The power of God had wrought; and it is the same power in which the service of God is to be carried out.
In the presence of all this these women are affrighted and perturbed, and instead of going forth with the wonderful tidings committed to them they speak to no one. It is better, surely, to be silent if you have nothing to say, but when you are entrusted with a divine message it is disobedience to be silent. You all remember how Zacharias is spoken of by Luke; he was serving "in the order of his course" (@Luke 1:8), you could not point a finger at the order, or the rectitude of his service, but when the angel Gabriel came to him with glad tidings he was *unable to believe*; and if one does not believe, one should not speak. Unless you can present something by faith it is better to be silent; and Zacharias was rendered silent (dumb) until what the angel promised should be fulfilled, and then he blesses God and announces the mind of God. If you have a message, it is sinful to hold your peace. These women were silent. How unworthy it is to go about pursuing the circumstances of daily life and saying nothing to anyone of Christ in resurrection! What a wonderful privilege it is to speak of Him thus! How humbling to refrain from it! Are these things not applicable more or less to us? How
{419}
much are we saying to people about Christ? These women were so disconcerted, so affrighted that "they said nothing to any one". It is chapter 9 extended -- there is no ability to speak about Christ.
And so the Lord Himself takes the matter in hand; He ever does, so that while I speak in the way of exhortation, I turn for a moment to speak of the Lord, so that we may see what *He* does. In such circumstances He always takes matters up Himself. He appears first to Mary Magdalene. Who is to be the person in any particular meeting to whom He will appear first? He will reveal Himself to one person. He revealed Himself to Mary Magdalene; she was told to speak and she did. Think of God having someone who can speak about Christ! Paul says, "I have believed, therefore have I spoken" @2 Corinthians 4:13. She believed, and therefore she spoke. Nobody believed her. This is a most sorrowful picture, especially as there is so much that corresponds with it today. The ninth verse stands over against the eighth; in the former Mary does not speak, but now she speaks of what she had seen and heard, and yet no one believed her. It is very humbling to speak of Christ and no one believe, but the testimony is rendered (let us remember that) and those who hear us, their blood is on their own heads, not on ours. She had discharged her responsibility; she spoke, although no one believed.
But the Lord says, as it were, 'I am not going to stop at that'; nor does He ever. He appears in *another* form; such is His zeal to have the testimony rendered, and so He appears to two of them in "another form". I cannot tell you what that form was, but it was *another* one, for the Lord works in a variety of ways to effect His purpose. It was another form, and He appeared to two of them as they walked "into the country". I am always afraid when believers go into the country, that is, to seek more
{420}
comfortable houses, gardens, etc. Of course, it is another matter when a man's calling takes him there. This is not the time for the country. The time for the country is coming; the present time is a time of testimony to men, and men are found in cities. There is a time of suffering and discomfort as might be experienced in the city, in order to render testimony in the city, and so these two returned, and they also bare testimony; "They went and brought word to the rest". It is the Lord's doing. First He got one, now He has got two to bear testimony, but we read, "neither did they believe them". How extraordinary! But is Mary Magdalene's testimony for nothing, and the testimony of these two? No, they represented the Lord, they performed their service although it was without effect for the moment. "Let us not lose heart in doing good" @Galatians 6:9. Let us not grow faint in the service of speaking of Christ. "I have believed, therefore have I spoken" @2 Corinthians 4:13. So the speaking is to go on. It is a time of speaking. There is a time for speaking as we read in Ecclesiastes, and that time is now, so the speaking is to continue. Paul says, "Your toil is not in vain in the Lord" @1 Corinthians 15:58.
Then the Lord comes in Himself. He will not give up, beloved; the Lord will pursue His own line, and results are sure to come. He Himself moves and He upbraids the eleven as they sat at meat. How they needed it! When Mary told them He was *alive* you would assume their hearts would have burned with joy at the thought of it; but when she came and announced the fact they disbelieved her. Such is the natural hardness of our hearts, and so the Lord upbraided them with "their unbelief and hardness of heart". He had Mary's testimony and the testimony of the two to point to, and He could bring these two testimonies forward in upbraiding them with the unbelief and hardness of heart they had manifested. But nevertheless the end is reached.
{421}
I speak these things for our encouragement, for the Lord is unfailing as "the faithful and true witness" (@Revelation 3:14), and He is on the right hand of God, and the Holy Spirit is here, so the speaking will go on, the service will continue, and results will come. And then He says to the eleven, having reached them and adjusted them, "Go into all the world, and preach the glad tidings to all the creation". Think of all the world -- the wideness of the mind of God in regard to the gospel! And "to all the creation"!
Then further He says, "He that believes and is baptised shall be saved, and he that disbelieves shall be condemned. And these signs shall follow those that have believed". I wish in closing to emphasise the thought of believing in connection with service. Mark, the Lord does not say, 'These signs shall follow *you*', but 'those who believe', that is to say, the word applies to believers at all times: "In my name they shall cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they should drink any deadly thing it shall not injure them; they shall lay hands upon the infirm, and they shall be well". Now you see the ability to help. I do not go into the detail of these things, I simply confine myself to one point -- the stated ability to help, and that it belongs to those who *believe*. It is a question of *faith*. The signs imply that there is ability to help every possible condition of need in man.
Then it goes on to say, "The Lord therefore, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat at the right hand of God". Note that the young man sat on the right side of the sepulchre and the Lord sits on the right hand of God. The apostles at Jerusalem gave their right hands to Paul and Barnabas. All these are allusions to *power*. Power comes from the right hand of God; the power that wrought in Christ when God raised Him from the dead -- that power flows out to support those who
{422}
believe. Our expressed fellowship implies that we are ready to assist those who preach and teach the truth, according to all the means we have got. The right hand means, 'I am with you according to all that I have got'. The Lord sat on the right hand of God, and the disciples went forth and preached "everywhere". How perfect was the result as the Lord took the service into His own hands! "And they, going forth, preached everywhere, the Lord working with them"; it is not simply that signs followed them, but there was evident power to help, faith being there. May God bless His word.
{423}
SPIRITUAL PROGRESS, INWARD AND UPWARD
@1 Samuel 22:5; @2 Samuel 1:1 - 12; @2 Samuel 2:4; @2 Samuel 5:10
I have spiritual progress in mind in linking these scriptures, believing that it is only as we are progressing spiritually that we are safe. Christianity does not contemplate our being stationary, but our being in movement, and I wish to show that movement in a spiritual sense is upward. David's history, therefore, affords an apt type in this respect, as it does in others, of the present dispensation.
The books of Samuel afford a much more life-size picture of David than the other book does which records his history, namely, 1 Chronicles, which presents to us David in relation to the ark. In Samuel we have what is more personal and more extended, and so we have much more typical detail as to Christ personally, and also as to the believer, and I wish to show that these passages that we have read depict how the Lord, as identifying Himself with us, leads us forward, instructing us as we go, until we reach, in the apprehension of our souls and in our experience, the highest point of spiritual elevation, that is to say, the truth presented in Ephesians.
The idea of elevation is prominent throughout Scripture -- the idea of great elevation. We have it in the ark of Noah, built, you will remember, in first, second, and third storeys. In connection with these storeys there were cells, as if in the divine system God would afford us, not only a great elevation, an ascent which can be taken in spiritual power, but also spheres of privacy in which to contemplate and take account of things in an undisturbed way, for God furnishes us bountifully with educational advantages. The divine system of education is much more
{424}
lavishly endowed than any other; every part of it is suggestive, educative -- at every turn you get something of the mind of God. And so as one would move about the ark of Noah, one would catch something of the living variety there is in God's world -- a world created in first, second, and third storeys. Then there are places of retreat, cells or rooms in which the believer may contemplate undisturbed, and meditate upon any of the varieties or features of that world which God has before Him. As I say, the educational system is wide and varied, so that no believer should be uneducated, but that we should be all taught of God.
In the history of David, as I hope to show, these features appear as peculiarly typical of the present time. In @1 Samuel 22 he is seen as the gathering centre; his brethren and his father's house, and all who are in distress come to him in the cave of Adullam, which is indicative of believers in their initial history coming to Christ and finding Him, in His great moral superiority, acquiring rule over them. David became captain, it says. It was not that anyone appointed him to that position, it was a question of his moral greatness; he secured that place. It is the safety of the believer at the outset to recognise the moral supremacy of Christ; it is due to Him that He should rule over us, because of what He is morally.
What I wish to call attention to is that blessed as that experience of coming under the influence of Christ is, the mind of God is that we should progress, and so the prophet Gad is introduced. The prophet is to bring the mind of God to us unsolicited. A prophet represents God's patience with us and he would not, therefore, have us to continue in the cave. The word of the prophet was that they should go up into "the land of Judah". The mind of God for the believer is that whilst he has come under the rule and the influence of Christ, his foot is to be planted on
{425}
the ground of divine sovereignty and purpose. It is obvious that God is sovereign and that He works sovereignly, and that He has a sphere to which His sovereign work refers. David, therefore, was to go up to Judah. It is the first movement, as I may say. It may be that some of you have not made this move, it may be that you are just resting in the recognition of Christ as Lord. But God has greater thoughts for you. Judah, I apprehend, represents the sovereignty of God as standing out in relation to the other tribes: "The Lord ... chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved" @Psalm 78:68. I hope to come to this presently. He has a spot which He loved, and He would have you there. Zion is not mentioned here, it is Judah, but Zion is included in Judah. I only just touch on these features.
I go on to Ziklag. I desire to convey to you that in the progress we make spiritually, the Spirit of Christ, the spirit of the kingdom lays hold of us, and Ziklag is the spot where the spirit of the kingdom is developed. We must get the spirit of things, beloved brethren. What you find in Romans is that the spirit of things is developed, so that we have there newness of spirit, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of adoption; @Romans 7:6; @Romans 8:9; @Romans 8:15. David, we read, came to Ziklag. Ziklag is recovered territory; it is territory which had been lost and was regained. I hope to show that the territory which God has in His mind for us is not quite that, but it is very educational to abide in territory that has been recovered, for recovered territory involves prowess, it involves conflict, it involves tears. How many of us understand what it is to weep in connection with the things of God? Ziklag is a place of tears, the place where you begin to become serious about things. You cease to be light-hearted in attending a meeting, or in reading the Scriptures, you become sober, and solemn, and tearful. Such is the education of Ziklag! Everything
{426}
that belonged to David -- his men, their wives and children -- all had been carried away. It was the greatest disaster, and they wept, it says, until they had no more power to weep. I should like to see someone weep like that. Possibly you have never seen a person weep until they had no more power to weep. It is not merely tears coming to the eyes, it involves the whole *power* of the man, and David was that man; we read he excelled Jonathan in weeping (@1 Samuel 20:41); and now at Ziklag he weeps until there is no more power to weep. He faces, in type, the bitterness of Gethsemane and the cross -- what it cost our Lord Jesus Christ to become Man in order to restore that which He took not away, to bring back to God that which had been captured by the enemy. And He did it; prowess was there. It is at Ziklag that the spirit of the kingdom is developed in us, and that is what I want to speak of. We become then real men in our fibre, in our character; we are no longer babes or mere spectators in the things of God, we become part of the thing. So you find in the previous part that David recovered all. There were, however, certain wicked men in his army; alas! that it should be so. He does not himself call them wicked men, but the Holy Spirit does: "wicked men and men of Belial" @1 Samuel 30:22. These men say that the two hundred men who were not able to go over the brook, must be satisfied with their wives and children; we shall not give them aught of the spoil. But the Holy Spirit speaks of these men as "wicked men and men of Belial" (@1 Samuel 30:22); they were devoid of the spirit of David, devoid of the spirit that characterises the kingdom of God. But David answered, "Ye shall not do so, my brethren ... as his share is that goes down to the battle, so shall his part be that abides by the baggage: they shall share alike" @1 Samuel 30:23,24. Such is the spirit of David! He addresses them peaceably and graciously. It is the spirit of surrender, the surrender of any sense of
{427}
natural rights -- one of the most important lessons to learn in the school of God. David becomes a legislator at that point, for this is not a matter of mere words, for "And it was so from that day forward; and he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel" (@1 Samuel 30:25); it must stand in the kingdom of David. I would commend that statute to every one here, particularly to young people -- the spirit of yieldingness, the spirit of non-insistence of your rights, the spirit of grace and consideration for others.
In the second book of Samuel it says, after all these things "David abode two days in Ziklag" (@2 Samuel 1:1). @2 Samuel 1 is to bring out how this great law that David had set up shone out resplendently in David himself; he himself was already what he had set up as a law. I commend this chapter to you; many of us have read it and perhaps misunderstood it. On the third day there comes to David a man out of the camp of Saul with news of the death of Saul and Jonathan. The bearer of it is a man of no spirituality whatever; he thought forsooth to bring good tidings to David, but David was too advanced in the law of the kingdom to which he was to give character, to admit of any such thing as that the death of one anointed of the Lord should be a matter of good news. We must never take pleasure in the calamity of those who have been anointed. God knows about them and deals with them, if they have turned out of the way, but as possessing the spirit of the kingdom we shall never rejoice over their calamity. So David wept for Saul and for Jonathan. We have not time to dwell upon all the happenings at Ziklag, but one would earnestly desire that all, the young ones particularly, should study it for themselves and become imbued with the Spirit of Christ; in other words, that you might learn the epistle to the Romans, which goes a long way on the line, not exactly of elevation, but of moral adjustment. The
{428}
effect of that is that you are morally right about every possible question that may come before you. You are never at a loss, for you know how to deal with every several matter that is brought to your attention; you are never less than one of the sons of the kingdom; you are like God who causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good (@Matthew 5:45), and you are not overcome by evil, but you overcome evil with good; @Romans 12:21. It is for every one of us to learn how to triumph over evil. I would commend to you these days at Ziklag, and what happened as the result of the exercises, in the complete vindication and exemplification of the statute that David legislated in Israel.
Now I come to the next passage. It is in chapter 2 that we begin to ascend. One has often remarked that we do not begin to ascend until we are adjusted. I am speaking now on moral lines. The sovereignty of God has reference to what Gad said @(1 Samuel 22:5), and that is special, it is the mind of God; but in @2 Samuel 2, after these things, after complete adjustment, *David* inquires, "Shall I go up into one of the cities of Judah?" Have you ever had a thought like that -- shall I go up? Do you ever pray like that? We pray for many things, but do you ever pray like that? We talk about the rapture, and rightly, for we are looking forward to it; we shall be caught up; but that is not in view here. Did you ever ask the Lord to help you into Colossians? You see that is the thing. You are to advance upward. Colossians is marked by prayer. If you look at it, you will find the word 'combat' in regard of prayer. In Ephesians we have the "knees" (@Ephesians 3:14) but in Colossians it is "combat" @Colossians 2:1. The apostle would have them know what great combat he had for them and for those at Laodicea and for as many as had not seen his face in the flesh (what a number he had in his mind) "that their hearts may be encouraged, being united together
{429}
in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the full knowledge of the mystery of God" @Colossians 2:2. It is marked by prayer, and so David here asks the Lord as to whether he should go up to one of the cities of Judah, and the Lord says, "Go up". How God delights in that desire!
Adjusted here, Ziklag for the moment left behind, you want to progress into one of the cities of Judah. It is not now merely Judah -- the forest of Hareth (@1 Samuel 22:5) -- it is one of the *cities* of Judah. Then David wishes to know which city. God will direct you, He will never fail you even as to detail. He says, as it were, 'I have a world and I want the believer to come into it'. There are things you never thought of or saw, things that never entered into the heart of man, nor is the heart of man capable of receiving them -- "that *hidden* wisdom, which God had predetermined before the ages for our glory" @1 Corinthians 2:7. There you have moral elevation; God says, I will bring you into my world. Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt (see @Numbers 13:22), that is to say, it is before the world. It is wonderful that God should direct your soul there, where, so to speak, you see the hill-tops of eternity. It is not final, but it is on the way to finality, it is the highroad to it. You will remember that the numbering began there in regard of those who came to David. In @1 Chronicles 12 we have the gathering of the people to David first at Ziklag; then they gathered to him to the hold in the wilderness and finally they gathered to him at Hebron. At the first two places we have no numbering. It is of no use to count unless we arrive at Hebron; until then we are on doubtful ground. There is the possibility of falling in the wilderness until we arrive at the purpose of God, until we arrive in our souls at the knowledge of God who raises the dead, to the knowledge that we are raised indeed with Christ on the principle of faith, raised by the power of God.
{430}
It is not until you reach that point that you are counted, that you are taken account of for heaven, that you are reliable and no longer "drawers back to perdition", but reckonable as of "faith to saving the soul" @Hebrews 10:39. Earlier -- that is to Ziklag and the stronghold -- certain ones came to David of this and that tribe who were distinguishable by their names, but the number of the persons is not given; it was a question of the names only -- individuals of prowess standing out like mountain peaks; but when we reach Hebron we have the numbering -- a vast number, thousands of Israel came to David to Hebron to make him king. They said, so to speak, 'We have done with Saul for ever'; they came "to transfer the kingdom of Saul to him" @1 Chronicles 12:23. There is the utter refusal henceforth of the man after the flesh; he is abandoned for ever: everything centres in Christ, the Christ of God, at Hebron. Christ is everything and in all. There are only two men who stand out at Hebron whose names are given -- Jehoiada, the prince of the Aaronites, and Zadok, a young man mighty of valour. In the one we have spiritual wealth and priesthood, and in the other we have youthfulness, energy of life, and these are the features that mark the Colossians. "If therefore ye have been raised with the Christ, seek the things which are above" @Colossians 3:1. The world is left behind. Your eye is fixed on Christ: and "when the Christ is manifested who is our life, then shall ye also be manifested with him in glory" @Colossians 3:4. In accord with the answer Jehovah gave David, he went up with his wives and his men and their families and *dwelt* in the cities of Hebron. That is to be noted.
In closing I go on to chapter 5. I should like to have had a little longer time, because it is a wonderful chapter. We have no prayer in it. David knew God's way; it is no longer a question of guidance. The full purpose of God is in his mind; as I was
{431}
saying, he sees the hill-tops of eternity, speaking figuratively, and he goes up to Jerusalem (verse 6). Jerusalem answers to Ephesians. You remember that when he slew Goliath he took his head to Jerusalem -- a fact a little difficult to explain historically, but perfectly simple spiritually and typically as regards Christ, for "Having ascended up on high, he has led captivity captive, and has given gifts to men" @Ephesians 4:8. He has gone far above all the heavens. Spiritual altitude is emphasised in Ephesians; we are blessed with every spiritual blessing *in the heavenlies in Christ*. He is supreme. He has gone far above *all heavens*, that He might fill all things. That is what Jerusalem is the type of. David goes there, but before going there Hebron had become the gathering centre, not only for Judah, but for all Israel. Colossians is entering the sphere of divine territory and all the saints must go that way; there is no other way from the standpoint of experience; you pass *that* way -- through death into the light of a divine world, to the place where Christ has gone. He says, I want you to go to where the blessings are. You may say, I would like the blessings here; but the Lord would say, You have to go there, they are all there. Many of us are merely millennialists, but every spiritual blessing with which *we* are blessed is *in the heavenlies*; we have every incentive to go there -- Christ is there, God is there, and our blessings are there. "But God, being rich in mercy, because of his great love wherewith he loved us, (we too being dead in offences,) has quickened us *with* the Christ, (ye are saved by grace,)". "With" there refers to the saints. We do not go up severally. We often say that such and such a one has gone to heaven. They have gone to be "with Christ" @Philippians 1:23. Going to heaven is collective in Scripture. We are raised up *together* and made to sit down *together* in the heavenlies in Christ.
David was seven years and six months in Hebron.
{432}
It was a time of learning for all who were there. They all recognise him and they make him king. Saul is abandoned, David is anointed; he then goes to Jerusalem. No one who clings to Saul can go there, but David goes to Jerusalem, and it says "the inhabitants of the land" (@2 Samuel 5:6) were there. There is nothing said about that at Hebron. The operations of the devil are specially in relation to Jerusalem. "Our struggle is not against blood and flesh, but against principalities, against authorities ... against spiritual power of wickedness in the heavenlies" @Ephesians 6:12. The Jebusites are the inhabitants of the land, they are characteristically of the *land*, they occupy the citadel; they represent spiritual wickedness in heavenly places. These have to be dislodged. We have to overcome, our conflict is with them, hence we have to put on the *whole* panoply of God, not part of it, if we are to make headway. It is true we shall come into possession at the rapture, but this passage is not the rapture, but, in type, it is believers entering in *now*. So it says, "David took the stronghold of Zion" (@2 Samuel 5:7), that is to say, the site of the sovereign mercy of God. It is a marvellous thought! "God, being rich in mercy, because of his great love wherewith he loved us" (@Ephesians 2:4); David says, I will take that, and he took it and it became "the city of David" (@2 Samuel 5:7) -- "the stronghold of Zion, *which* is the city of David" @2 Samuel 5:7. What is that for us? It is the heavenlies in Christ; Christ is supreme there. The reference is spiritual, it is that which is wholly Christ's, where every purpose of God is fulfilled. Presently He will operate outwardly; at the present time all is *inward*. It is a question of getting in and up; that is the line of progress at the present time. There is a definite line of progress in which we are to move, if we are to be according to God, and if we are to reach the sphere of His purpose in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus.
{433}
TABERNACLE CONDITIONS
@Exodus 25:8; @Mark 9:2 - 9; @John 14:23; @Ezekiel 11:14 - 16
My thought is to speak about the tabernacle, and particularly to show how the truth set out in it applies at the present time.
It is a very great conception, I may remark -- greater than the temple. It is the mediatorial idea, conveyed in a system. The mediatorial idea is in the temple also, but in a more limited way. The tabernacle represents the divine thoughts of God approaching man and of man approaching God, so that it conveys the idea of a dwelling -- a thought which holds under all circumstances, as I hope to show, even in circumstances such as those in which we are, and it runs into eternity. According to the word in Revelation, the tabernacle of God will be with men and He will dwell among them and be their God, showing that what took place in the wilderness will run through into the eternal state.
God had intimated His wish that there should be a sanctuary in which He might dwell among His people, and so I have ventured to connect the passage in Ezekiel with the subject because it brings out the place that brethren hold. In the next chapter to the one I read (chapter 12) we have the idea of captives and captives¬ baggage, pointing, as I apprehend, to the present time, as it does also to a later day in Israel. Chapter 11 is what is found amongst the brethren, not captives¬ baggage! Chapter 12 represents the general mass of profession in which there is not wanting the captives¬ baggage. The marks of captivity are upon Christendom in all its divisions and subdivisions; you will find there an abundance of the captives¬ baggage; it may be well-made
{434}
baggage, too, but it is of man, and it belongs to the captivity, that is to say, Christendom has come under the influence of this world, it has become captive and necessarily in its exile requires baggage suited to the land of its captivity, for the world has its own requirements, and the captive needs his baggage. Whereas the brethren stand apart. I hope to come back to this thought, but only refer to it now to show the connection.
I desire first of all to say a little about the tabernacle as it was originally set up. The great feature in Exodus is dwelling, and so the tabernacle is filled with the glory; it is the divine dwelling-place, anointed in every part of it, for God will have it in its completeness. Before it was anointed, every part of it was brought to Moses, item after item was brought to him, and he, as it were, passed it -- saw and beheld that they had done it as Jehovah commanded -- and then blessed it. It was then set up and anointed in every part of it with the holy oil, and then it was filled with the divine glory. It was the complete setting out of the tabernacle as set up in every detail according to the mind of God -- nothing wanting, no discrepancy in the least degree, and as anointed God comes into it and dwells in it. We have therefore presented to us the tabernacle from the divine standpoint in Exodus, suitable for God, the residence of His glory.
In Leviticus the idea is man's approach. God sets out first His own requirements (and He never lowers His standard), and these are fully met, and as fully met, He honours the system by dwelling there. In Leviticus He speaks from it to man, inviting men to approach. Leviticus is from that point of view, and hence the great place of the priesthood in that book. It is a question of the holiness of the place. God would be approached, He would have us draw near, He would have His people near to Him, for
{435}
"He loveth the peoples" @Deuteronomy 33:3! Love abhors distance, and so He would have His people near to Him, and according to His glory and His majesty.
When we come to Numbers, we find God speaking to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai in the tabernacle. Now it is the tabernacle as capacitated to be in the wilderness, to be with us in every circumstance. It is so constituted that it can be with us in every circumstance, and not only that God can be with us Himself, but with us in His ordered abode. He says, so to speak, I will be with you, but I will be with you tabernacle-wise. The first speaking we have in Numbers is in the wilderness of Sinai -- in the tabernacle but in that position. "Jehovah spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai in the tent of meeting" @Numbers 1:1. This really suggests a most touching thing; He is to journey with them morning, noon, and night, week after week, month after month, year after year, for the whole period of the wilderness. A most affecting reference, for "in all their affliction he was afflicted" @Isaiah 63:9. God Himself was with His people, but He was with them tabernacle-wise. The wilderness involves suffering, hence when the tabernacle was set up and anointed, the princes of the people approached with their offerings for the dedication of the altar -- the altar being typical of suffering. In Leviticus the altar is anointed seven times, in Numbers it is dedicated by the twelve princes of Israel -- *dedicated*, meaning that the saints, viewed in their spiritual wealth and understanding, recognise unitedly what is involved in the wilderness position -- that is suffering. It pointed to our Lord Jesus Christ becoming Man, and suffering. There could be no tabernacle without that; its bases were of silver; as we have often remarked, redemption must underlie it; the sufferings of Christ must be undergone, if God is to be with His people in the wilderness. You see, therefore, how Christ becomes
{436}
endeared to us as we apprehend the position in Numbers. The dedication by the princes shows what an apprehension they had, at least typically, of the sufferings of Christ. And perfect unity prevailed. I need not go over it, it is a long chapter, 89 verses, at the end of which it says that Moses went in to speak to God, but we read, "then he heard the voice speaking to him" (Numbers 7:89), as if to convey God's appreciation of the wealth of Israel's expression in regard of the sufferings of Christ. And so He spoke to Moses. Where did He speak from? He spoke from off the mercy-seat; He said virtually, What is expressed in your offerings enables Me to be with you, it enables Me to speak to you. This dispensation is marked by mercy, for it is "according to his own mercy he saved us" (@Titus 3:5); so that the mercy-seat is the basis of the position of this dispensation, and God speaks from off it. But further it adds, "the mercy-seat which was upon the ark of testimony" (@Numbers 7:89) -- the latter referring to the Person of Christ; God speaks in relation to that, and then from between the two cherubim.
Thus you see the position in Numbers implies that the saints, in the power of the Spirit, have come to recognise the altar; there is the united recognition of the value of the altar, which speaks of Christ's sufferings, and God recognises that and speaks. He ever speaks where these conditions exist in any measure, and the speaking covers the whole dispensation. There is the mercy-seat, the ark of testimony -- the Person of Christ -- and the cherubim of glory, which refers to the government of God, the majesty of God; divine speaking, at all times where these conditions in any measure exist, covers the dispensation. So we have the whole truth implied in the way God spoke to Moses on that memorable occasion. And then it says Moses spoke to Him; God makes it plain in His speaking that we may speak to Him. Christianity is marked by the word of God and prayer
{437}
-- God speaking to men and men speaking to God. Now these three books, I think, set out the divine thought in the tabernacle, and I want to connect it all with the position on the mount of Transfiguration in Mark, so that we may see how the type took form in a spiritual sense. The Lord said, "There are some of those standing here that shall not taste death until they shall have seen the kingdom of God come in power" @Mark 9:1. We are not told how many there were in the company addressed, but whether there were many or few, there would be, if they at all followed what the Lord had intimated, a challenging as to who would be so privileged. Am I to be amongst them? When it is a question of sovereignty who can tell whom God will choose? And so there were six days elapsed during which these exercises would necessarily continue, and during which the persons would be challenging themselves, if they at all valued what the Lord indicated.
At the end of these six days He selects Peter, and James, and John, and takes them up with Him to a high mountain apart, and He is transfigured before them. There is represented there material for the great spiritual tabernacle, "the true tabernacle which the Lord has pitched and not man" @Hebrews 8:2. It was not to be of this creation, we read, it was a different creation, the material is different; it comes, as it were, out of heaven. We need, dear brethren, to think a little more about new creation: "the true tabernacle which the Lord has pitched and not man" (@Hebrews 8:2), a "better and more perfect" (@Hebrews 9:11) one, as it is said, in connection with which He came. And as He Himself and these three came down from the mount, you can see, as it were, the tabernacle coming down -- "Jesus alone with themselves", for that is how it reads. Mark is the only one who gives it thus. Christ came down (according to Hebrews) in connection with the greater and more perfect tabernacle; it was to be wholly new and
{438}
heavenly. We need to understand that it is spiritual, that it is pitched by the Lord -- Lord meaning God, the Jehovah of the Old Testament brought into the New; God has pitched it.
When the Father revealed certain things to Peter, He was pitching it; He revealed to Peter that the lowly Man with whom he had to do was Christ the Son of the living God. It is in that connection that the tabernacle is pitched; it is spiritual. And so to Paul, He revealed His Son in him that he might preach Him as glad tidings amongst the nations. It is the divine doing, it is wholly spiritual, and the material is selected in a sovereign way. So that the six days having elapsed, they are taken up and He is transfigured before them and His "garments became shining, exceeding white as snow, such as fuller on earth could not whiten them" -- a suggestion of what is not of this creation. Moses and Elias appeared and they were talking with Jesus. They appeared to Peter, James, and John, and Peter introduces the idea of the tabernacle. The Jews had it, and he had what they had in mind, but although he was already in possession of the Father's revelation according to the gospel of Matthew, he talked about three tabernacles, one for Christ, one for Moses and one for Elias. But he did not know what he said, "he know not what he should say". He was not in accord with the revelation. And so a cloud appears -- pointing back to the wilderness -- and a voice out of it saying, "This is my beloved Son: hear him". It was as if to say to Peter: There is only one tabernacle, and you are to learn about that from the One beside you -- *My Son*. You cannot get any light about it elsewhere; *hear Him*! And so in the ministry of Christ there is the unfolding *in word* of the tabernacle -- He unfolded it in word. But the cloud appeared over them and the voice out of it to them as to Christ, and they looking around saw no one save Jesus only with themselves.
{439}
Thus we have, beloved, as the Lord comes down with those three from that glorious scene of light into this world, the tabernacle, as it were, coming down from heaven. What unfoldings from the words of that blessed One to these three men and to others! As the numbers would increase and increase the material was to be the same -- it was not of this creation. It is the better and more perfect one in connection with which Christ came, for He is indeed Himself the builder of it; it is wholly according to Himself, so that Peter, and James, and John were to be brought into accord with what they saw on that holy mount. As Peter said, "We have not made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, following cleverly imagined fables, but having been eyewitnesses of his majesty ... being with him on the holy mountain" @2 Peter 1:16 - 18. He had thus learned the significance of "Jesus alone with themselves". The tabernacle had been set up, he had part in it and he was of it. He would put off his own tabernacle, that is, his mortal body, he said, but he was part spiritually of a better and more perfect tabernacle in connection with which Christ came, and which remains.
I want now to show you what @John 14 implies, namely, that the privilege is available in the most *reduced* conditions outwardly in which the saints may find themselves. It corresponds, I believe, with the passage in Ezekiel. Earlier the Lord had said. "He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me; but he that loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will manifest myself to him" @John 14:21. That is one thing -- the manifestation of Christ. It means that I get some idea of the pattern, and I get that on the principle of obedience -- that is to say, my release from the captivity and the captives¬ baggage is in keeping His commandments. His commandments become
{440}
the way out, the way back. One would love to say that to all the Christians -- the true Christians in Christendom -- that release from captivity and the captives¬ baggage, is in humbly submitting to the commandments of the Lord. If you say to me, 'Where are they?' they are in the Scriptures. The first and second epistles to the Corinthians I would specially mention as embodying the commandments of the Lord for His people, and the second epistle of Timothy for the present time. In these you will find embodied His commandments, and having them thus and keeping them, you will find the way out of your captivity and release from the captives¬ baggage. And then the Lord will manifest Himself to you. Would you not like to get a view of Christ? He says, "I ... will manifest myself to him" @John 14:21. If you get a glimpse of Christ you will say, 'The land of my captivity and the captives¬ baggage do not agree with that'! A manifestation means that you see Christ and you therefore understand the pattern; and things must be according to the pattern.
Judas (not Iscariot) says, "Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not to the world?" (@John 14:22) and the Lord answered, "If any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him". It is not my commandments now; this supposes you keep His commandments and that He has manifested Himself to you; you have got the divine idea, you have seen Him, and now it is a question of His *word*, what He says; just as it was on the mount at the outset, Peter, James, and John -- the potential material for the tabernacle -- were to hear what He said. It is a question of what He says, and not what anyone else says. Turn a deaf ear to what all others say. How much has been said I need not comment upon; books that have been written from the time of the Fathers down to the present
{441}
time are myriad; you do not have to read them. But the words of Christ, we are to keep these. Hence, dear brethren, the recovery in our days has directed the people of God to the Bible. The more you look into it the more wonderful it is; the wisdom with which it is written, the way in which it has anticipated the needs of the saints of God in every circumstance is marvellous! You turn to the Bible, it contains the word; the Holy Spirit in you makes it living, makes it to your soul the veritable word of Christ, nothing less than that, just as if He were speaking directly to you; the power of the Spirit makes it the disclosure of His mind, of the mind of God. That leads you to look around. You say, 'I have obeyed His commandments, but now I see more than that, I see that the Lord has spoken many things, a wonderful range of things is in His word!' I see that His word provides for a dwelling-place for God. If I read in Ezekiel, I see that God can make Himself a "little sanctuary" to His people. Think of that, beloved friends! "Yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries whither they are come". God can be that to you. The word enables you to see that, and so the Lord says, "If any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him". Now look at that! *If any one love Me*. He had said before, "He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me" (@John 14:21), that is to say, your love is proved by the keeping of His commandments and that results in a manifestation. But now He puts it, "If any one love me, he will keep my word" (@John 14:21). It is an advanced position. As loving Him you not only read the Bible, but you regard the word of Christ and keep it, and in keeping it the tabernacle condition comes about. The word purifies you, it sets you right in every relation, it adjusts you, it enables you to see what is suitable to God, for the
{442}
word of Christ has the glory of God in view, and what is due to God in view, a dwelling-place for God here, so that it purifies you in every relation and adjusts you and you come in for tabernacle privilege; the Father and the Son come, not to visit you, but to make their *abode* with you. You may say, 'My circumstances are extremely small'. Never mind, the book of Numbers implies that God goes with His people wherever they go. "In all my going about with all the children of Israel" @2 Samuel 7:7. During all the time that I walked with them, He said to David, I never asked them to build me a house; He was content to go with them as dwelling in a tent. God patiently and graciously abides with us as those who keep the word of Christ as loving Him. So, dear brethren, in the day of smallest things (and we are in a day of small things) everyone who loves the Lord and who keeps His word comes in for tabernacle privilege -- the dwelling of the Father and the Son with him.
Now this leads to the thought of brethren, for in @Ezekiel 11:15, as well as in John, we have developed the idea of the brethren. In Ezekiel you have a man who cared, who had feelings about things. A certain calamity occurred, a certain man died suddenly, and Ezekiel said to Jehovah, "Wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?" @Ezekiel 11:13. He felt things. These are the men whom God takes account of, those who have spiritual feelings, who sigh and cry for the abominations that are done. Hence the word to Ezekiel is, "Thy brethren, thy brethren, the men of thy kindred". What about them? The inhabitants of Jerusalem say to them, The land is ours; you go away from Jehovah. Is there not that at the present time? Are there not those who assume proprietary rights to divine territory and exclude others? There are, and God feels it, and resents it; hence the captivity and the captives¬
{443}
baggage. He says, "*Thy brethren*". We may transfer that to the gospel of John, which speaks of the brethren of Christ, His kindred, wherever they are scattered. He says, "Yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary" -- a *little* one, in keeping with the circumstances, nevertheless He is there as really as He was in that glorious setting up of the tabernacle according to Exodus. "I will be to them as a little sanctuary". There is something peculiarly precious about it, 'I will be to you a little sanctuary'. We have to be content with small things, but never let us forget that the *quality* is equal to the beginning. What we have is equal to what they had at Pentecost -- no less than the Father and the Son making their abode with us.
{444}
SPIRITUAL MEN AS NEEDED TO MAINTAIN THE TRUTH
@Acts 1:10 - 14; @Acts 3:1 - 8; @Acts 4:36,37; @Acts 6:8 - 15; @Acts 8:5 - 8; @Acts 9:1 - 6
J.T. When Christianity was set up, the Holy Spirit calls attention to *certain persons*, and I thought we might consider them as illustrative of those whom God would use to maintain it here. In @Ezekiel 47 we read of a river issuing forth from the sanctuary of God, on the banks of which it is said there were trees. First it is said there were trees *on* the banks (@Ezekiel 47:7), and then that the trees *grew* out of the banks, bearing fruit every month (@Ezekiel 47:12). I have thought of that river as illustrative of the dispensation set up at Pentecost, and that these men of whom we have read correspond with the trees. Trees in Scripture are used as symbols of men, not as standing together as in a forest, but standing up separately in individual prominence. From chapter 3 of Acts onward the Holy Spirit calls attention to certain vessels; He brings them forward as needful for the maintenance of what is set up, with a view to our seeing that manhood according to God is essential to the maintenance of anything that God introduces, and that the babe condition as in Corinthians necessarily misrepresents the divine idea. The divine thought can only be maintained and continued by those who develop into manhood. I thought we might now look at the first chapter to see the material for the assembly, the circumstances in which it was set, and in which the Holy Spirit came to it.
Ques. Would you say that the divine thought has been presented pre-eminently in Christ first?
J.T. Yes; it shines out in Him, and especially at the end in @Luke 23, when the Lord is on the cross. They brought Him to the place of a skull, to the
{445}
termination of all that man is after the flesh -- nothing but a skull -- and there they crucified Him, and two others with Him, and He says, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do" @Luke 23:24. Manhood in Christ is set forth in superiority to the sufferings. There He was overcoming evil with good. This is seen supremely in Christ, so that He is recognised immediately, for one of the thieves says, "And we indeed justly, for we receive the just recompense of what we have done; but this man has done nothing amiss" @Luke 23:41. And then again, as the Lord utters a loud cry and delivers up His spirit to the Father, the centurion glorified God saying, "In very deed this man was just" @Luke 23:47. There was there in Christ the evidence of manhood according to God, particularly in the way of righteousness -- righteousness manifesting itself not only in doing right ordinarily, but in the assertion of God's rights, because He appealed to the rights of God in asking for forgiveness of His murderers on the ground that they did not know what they were doing. There you see manhood. The river issued by way of the altar -- the place of suffering, and it issued from the house. The growth on the banks is according to what marked the source; in other words the present dispensation is marked by men who are after Christ.
Ques. Do you mean that the divine thought being set forth in Christ we find men for the continuance of that?
J.T. Yes. These men we have read of in Acts represent men in the sense that the trees typify, standing out individually, each by himself, first as set there divinely, and then as the result of growth.
Rem. The apostles here are mentioned one by one, instead of in pairs as when they were appointed.
J.T. They are mentioned in the gospels, particularly in Matthew, in pairs, as two being better than one. The world is built up on the principle of two
{446}
which is the principle of organisation; the strength of the world lies in organisation, so God meets that with the same principle. Matthew gives an organisation of God, so that there you have many twos. For instance, "two of you" (@Matthew 18:19) (meaning two of the assembly) is called attention to, and so two apostles together involved more power than separately. Here in Acts the point is the names; it is to call attention to the dignity of the persons, what they were severally, what they represent, namely, the authority of Christ. Then we read they continued in prayer, which shows they were men according to God. Luke brings the Lord forward as praying, and the disciples ask Him to teach them to pray, and here they continue in it. Manhood is there in the company. What is to be observed in the chapter is that the Lord is received up, not from Bethany, nor even from mount Olivet, but is received up *after saying certain things*, rather than from a geographical position. Those who saw Him go up returned, it says, from mount Olivet, and in intelligence they go, without being told, to the upper room, that is, the assembly was in view. They go to the upper room, which is another feature of manhood. They are not looking for publicity; they disappear into obscurity as regards the public eye; if they are forced into it, it is in the testimony and not on their own account; so that they do not go to the temple here.
Ques. As to those spoken of in the first chapter of Acts being representative of trees, would you say we get the idea in @Psalm 1?
J.T. You do in a very striking way; that is one of the passages that confirms the idea of a tree representing a man. It is well to note the difference between this chapter (@Acts 1) and the end of Luke, where the Lord leads the disciples out as far as to Bethany, and He is taken up from there -- "carried
{447}
up into heaven" @Luke 24:51. The bearing of that is intended to convey the longsuffering of God towards Israel; the disciples were set in nearness to the city, on remnant ground. He leads them away from the city, but not too far, but to a point from which they could return, and there in Luke they returned not to the upper room but to the temple.
Ques. Why did Peter and John go to the temple in @Acts 3?
J.T. I think you will see why if you understand the bearing of chapters 1 and 2. Luke emphasises grace, whereas Matthew says they were sent out from Galilee, because Matthew asserts the government of God, and Jerusalem was guilty, but in Luke they could go to the temple in grace. And so in the end of Luke they were to be witnesses there. He leads them out as far as to Bethany, not further; in Matthew it was to Galilee. In leading them to Bethany -- that far only -- it was grace; there was a certain condemnation, but then it was grace, its distance was given elsewhere: fifteen stadia; @John 11:18. And then as His hands were uplifted He was carried up, showing heaven's approval. It was grace, and the disciples returned to Jerusalem with great joy. They were not *sent* back, but as blessed they *went* back. The Lord is not specially committed to their going back. It is a principle of grace, that those who are blessed become a blessing. They returned to Jerusalem and were in the temple praising and blessing God. But when we come to the Acts there is nothing said about Bethany; what is enlarged upon is what He said to the disciples after He suffered. That is what gives colour to the dispensation; the One who speaks has suffered. And it says they were gathered together to Him and asked Him questions, and He unfolded things, and it goes on to say, "having *said these things* he was taken up, they beholding him, and a cloud received him out of
{448}
their sight" @Acts 1:9. There is nothing said about the cloud in Luke. They are now left in a position requiring *faith*, and that governs the present dispensation.
Rem. In Luke it says they saw Him go up!
J.T. Yes, it was the remnant character. In the Acts they stood gazing up into heaven as He was going, as if they did not understand that it was a faith dispensation. Hence the two angels say, "Why do ye stand looking into heaven?" They were to be in faith henceforth, and that governs the whole dispensation. Now instead of thinking of publicity, for they had seen wonderful things, more than any others in Jerusalem, they go to the upper room. There were persons there who could be trusted with the rights of God in Christ. The names of the apostles are given; they are men who are known to be trustworthy, hence eleven apostles¬ names are given one by one.
Ques. Would it be right to say that what had been entrusted to Christ is now entrusted to them?
J.T. Yes, they all continued with one accord in prayer, with the women, it says. Prayer was to be continued in; it was in faith, and also in dependence. The subjective state is seen in the women. So I think we have the composition of the assembly -- the women, the mother of Jesus, and His brethren -- all who were dear to Christ.
Rem. Is it not beautiful to see how they could act intelligently in choosing a disciple?
J.T. Yes, that is especially in Peter. He represents, I suppose, manhood fully, so that he knows what to do, and cites the Psalms. He goes over the ground in a remarkable manner, calling attention to the kind of man who was needed to replace Judas, one who had assembled with them all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among them, beginning from the baptism of John until the day when He was taken up, that is to say, such an
{449}
one would have seen perfect manhood during all that time, and thus would have a knowledge of what was due to God.
Rem. Not a novice!
J.T. Just so. How much each one who had been with the Lord would have seen during that time! It brings out, I think, the value of experience.
Ques. Is that why the apostle says in Timothy, "God has been manifested in flesh ... received up in glory" @1 Timothy 3:16?
J.T. Yes; and it is remarkable that that comes in after Paul had given the qualifying features of those who should have office in the house of God. Attention is called to the whole course in that verse in Timothy. That is very suggestive for those who have part in the assembly. Now in coming to speak of the men which the trees illustrate the first thing is that we have two men. I think they represent what was to go down the whole history of the dispensation on the collective side. They went up *together*, it says. The Spirit might have said they went up, but He says, "together". Attention is called to the ability and effectiveness of two men formed after Christ; they were a wonderful spectacle morally; the ordinary eye did not see anything special, but heaven saw much. They could say, "Look on us", and the lame man did look on them. They disclaimed having anything of the world; Peter says, "Silver and gold I have not". Two such spiritual men going up together to the temple indicated what God had effected. Peter and John would thus represent the dispensation from a collective standpoint. They were administering, and the Lord added daily such as should be saved. There was something there that He could add to, and what was added was of the same character as those who went up together. It is the collective principle, what is *together* according to God. There were thousands at Jerusalem already
{450}
together, but it is not the number, but the very *best* that God has. The apostles were divinely set there, they could hardly be said to be growths, but I think Barnabas, and Stephen, and Paul were growths, but the twelve were there before. Chapter 3 gives us to see the moral greatness of God's best, seen together. See how comely it is!
Ques. Do Peter and John represent certain features of the dispensation?
J.T. They do. If you go through the gospels you will see they were men specially trained. First they are seen in their natural settings. Peter and Andrew his brother are together in the boat, and John and James his brother with their father Zebedee. The Lord takes them out of their natural settings and He makes a spiritual pair of them. He puts them into spiritual settings and they are cultured in that. On great occasions in the Lord's life they were there, and what we have here was in view in all that. God has superlative ideas and these two men represent His best then on earth and they are seen here in movement. The Lord, I think, would bring us back to this. Matthew speaks of "two of you" (@Matthew 18:19), meaning two of the assembly.
Rem. I suppose Peter represents the administrative side, and John the family thought?
J.T. You have not anything about Peter with his father, but you do have it stated that John was with his father; so that with regard to the government of the house of God, Peter maintains rule; he would enlarge on eldership, whereas John would enlarge on the *family*, and he would include all believers in the family. If you have moral power present, as in Peter, you need not be afraid of the young coming in. John will not have any of the children slighted. But he has to reckon with Peter. So in Luke, Peter and John are sent to prepare the passover. As the Lord's supper developed from this,
{451}
their service specially bears on the whole dispensation.
Rem. It seems to me that if these two principles prevailed in our meetings we should have very little difficulty.
J.T. Yes, quite so. You would have the ass and the colt. The Lord sits on the ass and the colt together, so that He can use old and young *together*. Then the two -- Peter and John -- merge in "their own company" @Acts 4:23. The idea is asserted, that while two of them are distinguished, yet it says, "with great power did the *apostles* give witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus" @Acts 4:33. While God distinguishes, He makes it clear that the others are not ignored. Then after all these exercises you get a prince in Barnabas. He has means, and he lays the money at the apostles¬ feet.
Ques. Do you suggest that if things were held rightly according to God, Barnabas would be the result?
J.T. I think chapter 4 makes room for the thought of a prince. A prince was brought in to augment what was there, but we do not see the full bearing of Barnabas until we come to Antioch. One great characteristic of a prince is he seeks to maintain the unity of the Spirit, that is to say, universal unity. Elders were appointed in *every* city. The qualifications for eldership were princely. Paul's journey to Jerusalem (@Acts 20, @Acts 21) brought out the evidence of the work of God in the assemblies visited.
Ques. What is the difference between a prince and a son of consolation?
J.T. A prince is to be taken account of as he comes in. Princes are not small men, they are occupied with great things. Things happen which affect the testimony in various places; a prince would take account of those things, and would recognise what was done in other places. It is a principle with God that princes should be "in all the earth" @Psalm 45:16.
{452}
They are not party men. Barnabas failed later, but the Spirit of God sets him before us as an unselfish man, rejoicing in the work of God wherever it was. He rejoiced in the work of God at Antioch, and he went to Tarsus to seek out Saul, showing that he was an unselfish man; so that with such you would have unity maintained. The twelve princes in Numbers are a type of this, they have the *same* apprehension of Christ. Barnabas was a suitable companion for Paul. There was a binding influence with him; he would co-ordinate the work of God by a good influence. He was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit. He had means of his own and he contributes to unity. Now the next man standing out prominently is Stephen, a witness, a martyr, one who was able to suffer -- another feature of manhood. He was one who was prepared to suffer for the testimony, and in suffering he was superior to evil, for he says, "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge" @Acts 7:60. He is overcoming evil with good. Stephen's position is one of the most interesting; he sets forth the idea of a witness -- one who could lay down his life for the truth. It is right to use wisdom in what we say, we do not want to raise opposition needlessly; we read of Stephen that his opposers were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit with which he spoke. In witnessing you must be accurate, not speaking beside the mark.
Then, following this we have in the scattering, through the persecution, a preacher coming into evidence -- an evangelist. There was not much encouragement, because a furious opposition was raging. Philip is a type of that manhood which does what his hand finds to do. A young man often qualifies by *starting* to serve; Philip went down to Samaria and preached Christ to them.
Ques. Where is the best place to start?
J.T. According to the opportunity, I think. Notwithstanding the rivalry between Jerusalem and
{453}
the Samaritans, Philip goes down to Samaria. It was evidence of his manhood, he was not governed by natural or national feelings. He was ready to preach Christ whenever and wherever the opportunity offered.
Ques. Is the open air as good a place as any to see if one has ability to preach?
J.T. Yes. "Wisdom crieth without; she raiseth her voice in the broadways; she calleth in the chief place of concourse" @Proverbs 1:20,21. Peter "lifted up his voice and spoke forth to them" @Acts 2:14. Philip simply went of himself; you may not be asked by the brethren; the difficulty, however, often is that you are not preaching. Philip was not asked to preach, as far as we can see; it was his own act.
Rem. Surely the brethren would be sympathetic with young brothers.
J.T. Yes, no doubt, but you want to be sure they can preach. When you ask a man to preach you are committed to him. It says, "Having laid their hands on them" @Acts 13:3. But Philip went of himself and there was an immense result -- the whole city was affected.
Ques. If you have one who can preach in the open air, but who takes no part in the meeting, would you be free to ask him to preach in the room?
J.T. No. A man should speak to God first; to have power with men you must first of all speak to God.
Ques. What about Stephen's face shining as the face of an angel?
J.T. The heavenly side was coming in. I suppose Paul was the counterpart of Stephen. In Paul the heaven is fully opened up and expanded.
Rem. You spoke just now about not seeking publicity. That has been used against speaking in the open air.
{454}
J.T. Not seeking publicity has reference to your relations in the assembly, but when it comes to the question of testimony you cannot help being public; it was said of the Lord that His "fame went out straightway into the whole region" (@Mark 1:28), but that was not His desire.
Rem. Philip was content to go into the desert.
J.T. Philip was successful in the work in Samaria then the angel comes in, which seems to show that God may come in to direct you providentially in your circumstances. It may be you are diverted from what you were doing, but it is important to have your eyes open for the governmental ways of God. Then the Holy Spirit says, "Approach and join this chariot" @Acts 8:29. It is not now the angel. We have to distinguish between what is providential and the actings of the Spirit. Now in chapter 9 the Lord is taking things in hand Himself. There had been a good deal of voluntary work, but the Lord always shows that He is in control, so He comes in in an authoritative way according to chapter 9. He will always come in and take things in hand for Himself.
Rem. The Lord knows whom to use.
J.T. Yes, and it is His own sovereign selection. If things are hanging loosely, something will happen, the Lord will come in and then there will be a new movement.
{455}
THE FAITHFULNESS OF GOD
@1 Corinthians 1:9; @Genesis 8:22; @Genesis 9:11 - 15; @Genesis 21:33,34; @Genesis 22:19; @Genesis 26:22 - 25; @Genesis 26:33
I wish to speak about the faithfulness of God. I have read from 1 Corinthians for the connection of it in the New Testament, hoping to illustrate it from the Old Testament.
Corinthians and Romans run together, dealing with believers in their initial stages of growth. Romans treats of the individual -- the side of the truth that appertains to us severally, leading up to our being set together as "one body in Christ" @Romans 12:5. The epistles to the Corinthians treat of Christians as so set, regarded as the assembly of God, and in both the epistle to the Romans and in those to the Corinthians the idea of the faithfulness of God is emphasised. In Colossians and Ephesians the thought is not so evident, for it is young believers who need it particularly, that is to say, believers in their early growth.
There is what may be called the *tender* stage to which the faithfulness of God applies as a steadying factor, but as we advance in the knowledge of God, and have learnt to reckon upon His faithfulness, then we think more of His love, we rest more in His love. We never lose sight of His faithfulness; if not for ourselves directly, certainly for our households, and for the saints in general. The faithfulness of God as reaching "unto the clouds" (@Psalm 36:5) ever remains with us, but we rest more in His love. As we know His love we do not ask for promises. It is in our initial stages that the promise and the oath become of especial importance; God intervenes then with two unchangeable things upon which the believer may rest with the utmost confidence, in order that we might have strong encouragement. The old ones never forget the value of
{456}
the promise and the oath, but having come to know God they require neither the one nor the other; in the language of another they can say, "I know whom I have believed" @2 Timothy 1:12. But the promise and the oath are, as I have said, of supreme importance to the believer in his initial stages.
And so we have it in this passage in Corinthians, "God is faithful". As called into the fellowship of God's Son we may reckon unfailingly on the faithfulness of God. He is concerned about His Son, about the fellowship of His Son. Then again we have the assurance in chapter 10 that God is faithful and will not allow us to be tempted above that we are able. One has proved in one's experience how God orders things for young believers, so that they should not come into temptation beyond that they are able to bear. In fact it applies to all, for each one of us has his measure; the most advanced is exposed, and has to reckon on the faithfulness of God to keep him out of the way of temptation. And further in the second epistle the apostle speaks of God's faithfulness in regard to what is preached -- that the word preached to us, the gospel of the Son of God, is not yea and nay, but yea is in Him -- in the Son of God, Jesus Christ. For in Him all the promises of God are yea and amen, so that if you have not found out that what the word of the gospel proposes is verified in Christ, there is some want in your soul, for if God ministers His word in the gospel to us, and we believe it, He *confirms* it.
I believe in the principle of confirmation, not in the ecclesiastical sense, of course, but in the divine sense, and no young believer should be without it; he should see to it that he is confirmed. And so what the apostle preached found its verification in Christ; He is the divine Amen of every divine proposal. So Paul says to the Corinthians, He who "has anointed us is God" (@2 Corinthians 1:21); he says also that God
{457}
has "sealed us and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts" @2 Corinthians 1:22. That is what I call confirmation. *God* does it. He anoints us, and seals us, and He gives us a portion for our own hearts in the Spirit. Thousands of believers are not confirmed, whereas confirmation is one of the most important features; we need to be *sure* of the things we have believed, and this is by the Spirit.
That I am anointed means that I am set up in dignity here, and in the light of that I renounce all natural dignity, whatever it may be; secondly, I am sealed, which means that I am marked off as the property of God. In the power of that I deny all other claims. The world puts forth its claims, nature puts forth its claims, but the divine claim is paramount. "God must be obeyed rather than men" @Acts 5:29. Sealing is the token of divine *ownership*: "Ye have been bought with a price" (@1 Corinthians 6:20), "ye are not your own" @1 Corinthians 6:19. And then finally I have something in my heart -- the earnest of the Spirit. I am not set up without the means of living accordingly, and those means lie in the Spirit, the earnest in the heart, and that is for myself. It is as if God says, I do not wish you to be in a dignified position without means of support. It is in these three things, beloved young people, that you are confirmed.
Now I wish to connect the great principle of the faithfulness of God with the scriptures read in Genesis. Those who have been confirmed will understand (for they indeed are the only ones who can rightly do so) the covenant made with Noah, with every living creature and with the earth. It was a very wide covenant. Believers in Christ who have the Holy Spirit alone understand it. Every man and woman in the world have benefited by it, I may say, as much as believers have. The prodigal in @Luke 15, as he went out from his father's house, used the
{458}
benefits accruing from this covenant; it is a covenant that alludes to the Gentile world.
How few of them thank God as seed-time and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter continue! As God sends His rain, giving fruitful seasons, filling men's hearts with food and gladness, how many thank God for these things? The sun that shines today is proof of the faithfulness of God, so too is the rain that comes down, the crops that come up from the earth, and the food that we eat; at every turn men are reminded of the faithfulness of God. There has been no change. His faithfulness is wonderful, and the whole race of mankind has benefited from God engaging Himself in this way in connection with creation, and continues to do so. There is no change.
So the apostle says, "He did not leave himself without witness, doing good ... filling your hearts with food and gladness" @Acts 14:17. The prodigal used the mercies, but he never thanked God, and so when repentance came into his soul he says, "I have sinned against *heaven*" (@Luke 15:18), for heaven had showered down these blessings upon him, and he was unthankful. He appropriated the things ministered, but without reference of heart to God. But there the covenant stands, and the bow in the clouds -- the token of it -- is given as the pledge of divine faithfulness to that covenant. And so as God resumes His direct relations with the earth in @Revelation 4 we find the bow is round about the throne -- the testimony to the race of mankind that God is faithful. Centuries do not change God; His word never fails, and so there is the bow around the throne. He has come in in faithfulness to remove that which prevented man enjoying the benefits of His covenant. Men do not know it, but the believer knows it -- God's covenant with Noah, with the cattle, and with the earth itself. We glorify God by giving thanks for the benefits every day.
{459}
I want to come now to what is spiritual; and so chapter 21 of Genesis presents us with the believer in the light represented by the weaning of Isaac, which does not go far in our spiritual progress -- we simply apprehend the weaning. The reference is not a question of the Person of Christ, but of our apprehension of Christ, and it belongs to the initial stage of the believer's progress. You connect Him with yourself, He is your Saviour, He died for you, but as yet you do not see Him in His own connection in relation to God. It has dawned on you that He *has* such a relation, and the light of it is coming into your soul. You apprehend Him as detached from Israel after the flesh. Isaac is weaned. Still you may retain your Ishmael, your own product, and therefore it is a very initial stage; it is the Galatian feature. You apprehend Christ but very little in His personal relation, for you would have your Ishmael with Him -- your own product. You are loth to part with the product of nature, with what you have produced yourself. You have been winking at it all these years, and you would fain add it to Christ. The voice comes, "Cast out this handmaid and her son" @Genesis 21:10. And Abraham opposes, he was loth to do it, but he did do it, thank God. You will make no spiritual head-way until you do it.
This is a question of the history of your soul, of moving into a region where Christ is all and everything. You are on the way to it, and as Ishmael is cast out you have advanced, and others take account of you as having advanced; so the Philistine king comes to Abraham immediately afterwards, and brings with him the captain of his army. He knew he had to do with a great man. Typically, a great person was in his house, that is Christ. Abraham had cast out the bondwoman and her son, he had advanced in his soul; the Philistine knows Abraham's greatness and he comes, and Abraham enters into a covenant
{460}
with him. It is not yet a covenant of God. It is a covenant the believer enters into, it is an engagement; it is no partnership with the world, it meant no partnership with Abimelech. Abraham enters into an engagement that he will do no harm to the Philistine - either to him or to his son. The believer need not be afraid of that engagement. We are not here to harm anyone; we avow at the outset of our spiritual history that we are not here to harm people; we are here to bless and to be a blessing.
And so Abraham accepts, and enters into a covenant with Abimelech, and then he reproves him. Reproof is no harm, as it says, "Do not have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather also reprove them" @Ephesians 5:11. And Abraham does it. And then he enriches Abimelech and brings forward seven ewe-lambs. Abimelech inquires, "What mean these?" @Genesis 21:29. They do not agree with his idea of greatness and power; he would think of an army, for he has a captain there, but they pointed to the power that marked Abraham. He says to the Philistine that they are to be a witness that I dug this well, that is to say, that Abraham's power lay in the Spirit. The Philistine would interfere with that, and so the young believer may assert his right; he is confirmed in it, and these seven ewe-lambs are a witness that the power of the Spirit is not harmful, is not hurtful, it is benign; it overcomes evil with good; and they were to be a witness to Abimelech for ever of the power of the Christian expressed in the scripture when it says, "For thy sake we are put to death all the day long; we have been reckoned as sheep for slaughter" (@Romans 8:36), and further, "We more than conquer through him that has loved us" @Romans 8:37. The Philistine can never say that -- he is more than a conqueror. The Christian can, and it is in the spirit of the ewe-lambs that he can do so.
I come now to verses 33 and 34, where we get the
{461}
position denoting the faithfulness of God. Beersheba is the place of the oath, and Abraham planted a grove there and called on the name of the everlasting God. It is as if he were to say, 'I have entered into an engagement and I need your help'. The eternal God! Calling on His name means that I shall need Him tomorrow; I proved Him yesterday, I am proving Him today, but I shall need Him tomorrow. It is a definite reckoning of faith; at Beersheba you have entered into an engagement, and you need the support of the everlasting God, and you will get it.
In the next chapter Abraham offers up Isaac. It says, "After these things" (@Genesis 22:1), that is, we have the sequel. Abraham has called upon the everlasting God. What is God going to do? He is going to give Abraham further blessing, further light. He has raised Christ, He has set Him down in heaven, and thus every promise is secure. And so Isaac is offered up and received back in a figure. How many of us understand what it is to receive Him back, to apprehend Christ risen, and that He is on our side?
We now touch on Colossians, we are touching ground that leads us outside this world, and so as Abraham is put to the test the voice from heaven is "Abraham, Abraham" (@Genesis 22:11), meaning he is known there, and in this connection he is tested, and he answers to the test, for he is willing to part with all that he has on this side, he is willing to trust God. He had called upon the everlasting God; he can trust Him now, and he can give up Isaac. And so God enters into a fresh covenant with him, so that Beersheba is no longer the well of *his* engagement, it is the well of *God's* engagement, and Abraham goes and dwells there. He does not call upon the name of Jehovah now, he needs no help for God's engagement. It was an engagement, a covenant from God's side entirely, there is no mediator in it; God enters this engagement, and Abraham dwells under the shelter of it.
{462}
But he did not dwell there alone. He had left Isaac and now he has "his young men". Isaac is received back from the dead, and nothing more is said of him in the chapter. Abraham returns to his young men and *they* go together to Beersheba. They go *together* to Beersheba -- a picture of the saints being together in the light of the faithfulness of God, of His covenant; and they *dwell* there. Now he has company. It is delightful to be dwelling under the shelter of the faithfulness of God in company with others. And they are *young* men. On the one hand we see Abraham, who was an old man, one with experience which they had not had; they had not been up the mountain, they were afar off, but they would come into the value of Abraham's wonderful experience there, as young brothers gain now from the old ones; on the other hand, you see the value of the young men as companions; how fresh they are. The assembly is composed of the old and the young.
It is to be noted that it is here that Abraham *hears* about Rebekah. We are free now for the assembly; we are free, under the wing of the faithfulness of God, to think of Rebekah, and so as Abraham dwelt there light came to him of the birth of Rebekah. It is not a question of Rebekah's personality, but the fact that there was such a person, and that she was related to Isaac. Dwelling together we come to realise that we are for Christ, not for ourselves, but for Him who died for us and rose again. So we come to the introduction of Rebekah, and hence the wonderful chapter 24. Each one of these scriptures would be enough for a sermon in itself, but I am sure you follow with delight as you think of a company old and young dwelling at Beersheba, and the light of the assembly coming in there. The assembly is for Christ, and hence chapter 24 brings in Rebekah and she is for Isaac.
I turn now to chapter 26, where it is a question of
{463}
being sustained in the land. It is full advancement here. Isaac is told to remain in the land, not to remove into Egypt. He is in the land, he claims those wells which Abraham had digged and which the Philistines had stopped, and he dug others. Here you will be opposed by Satan and the way of opposition is to cut off the means of support, the supply, so the wells were stopped. The enemy knows that if he can cut off the supplies you must give up the position, and so the wells are filled up with earth and other wells are contended for, but God makes room for Isaac; God does it. How could we get on collectively unless God came in? but He does come in. It is a question of holding the ground in the land, in other words, of maintaining the testimony. Thus the Lord makes room for us. We should never be in each other's way. I need not interfere with another's service, God gives plenty of room. The last well Isaac dug he named Rehoboth, which means Broadways. Then we read that he comes to Beersheba.
I wish to dwell on this point particularly, for it is a question of our being sustained in testimony in the land, and that there should be increase spiritually. It was in Isaac's mind that he should be fruitful in the land, for when he dug a well for which they strove not he said, "Jehovah has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land". All that we are bears on the testimony of God -- on the heavenly position of the saints. So Isaac went up to Beersheba and Jehovah appeared to him there the same night. It is as though God says, I know what is in your mind, I will support your spiritual resolves and you will go through; and then He says, I am the God of Abraham, "I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake". He says to you virtually, if you have spiritual resolves, I see your desires and will support you, but I want you to understand it is not to honour you, it is in relation to
{464}
Christ. And so Isaac accepts it, and at Beersheba he builded an altar and called on the name of Jehovah. He owns in that way, I need your help; he needed the help of Jehovah in this new untried position, and so do you, but first be sure that, having a right spiritual resolve, you have the divine approval, and He will help you.
And now Abimelech comes to him again with his captain and with his friend. We have advanced, we have come into the circle of the saints, we are in the light of the assembly, and the world would seek to impress us with its military power, with its political and also with its social power, and we are in danger of these as the Colossians were. How is it with us, beloved? Referring to Abimelech, his captain was a military man, he knew about the army, he could speak about the strength of it, but if I come to Abimelech's *friend*, what would he speak about? Social entertainments, social attractions; the world is full of these, and they are great snares to the people of God. But Isaac is not deceived. He says, "Ye hate me" @Genesis 26:27. John said, "Do not wonder ... if the world hate you" @1 John 3:13. Like Abraham, Isaac enters into a covenant not to hurt Abimelech, and as he sends away Abimelech and his captain and his friend, Isaac's servants come and say, "We have found water" @Genesis 26:32. As you refuse the world, God comes in and gives refreshment; so Isaac calls the name of that *city* Beersheba; it is now an ordered place, a place of administration, as you may say, a place for divine rule.
I think you will have some conception from what has been said of the faithfulness of God. You can rely upon it, so that you may be sustained in independence of the world, and be found in the land, and thus there will be maintained here a heavenly testimony outside everything which is of man in this world.
{465}
THE LOVE OF CHRIST
@Leviticus 8:29; @Ephesians 3:19; @Romans 8:35 - 38; @2 Corinthians 5:14 - 18
My intention is to speak about the love of Christ, and I hope to be able to show that it is presented in Scripture in divine order and at the same time in a variety of settings.
In turning to Leviticus I wish to show from the type, well known doubtless to most of us, the greatness and reliability of the love of Christ. It has to be apprehended in its greatness in order to see its applicability to specific circumstances, and I think the chapter in Leviticus affords us, in type, the setting of the love of Christ from the standpoint of its magnitude and reliability, for the breast of the consecration offering alludes to the love of Christ in that character. The offering itself refers to Christ as giving Himself for the saints; it is the consecration offering, and so I connect it with Ephesians because it is in that epistle that things are seen in their fulness and in their greatness, and hence the love of Christ is treated from that point of view in that epistle. He loved the assembly, we are told there, and gave Himself for it. And so in the corresponding passage in the gospels -- John 13 to 17 inclusive -- we have the love of Christ presented particularly, and one is encouraged to speak of it from this point of view, believing that there is sufficient appreciation of it in the brethren.
It was not that the Ephesians understood the full bearing of the love of Christ, but they were ready for it, they had had a taste of it in a peculiar way in the apostle in his ministry amongst them. The apostle was sufficiently in the possession and enjoyment of the love of Christ to convey it in some degree; and
{466}
so on leaving the Ephesians after his great service there, through which the assembly was gathered, he embraced them. I have no doubt that the embrace spoke of and conveyed more to them than they had hitherto experienced; *their* action is not referred to, it was a question of the energy of affection in the great vessel through whom the light had come, for an embrace is not simply a kiss. At the end of the chapter the Ephesian elders kissed Paul ardently. An embrace involves power, and so in dealing with Eutychus the apostle enfolded him in his arms. There was not only affection, but affection in power. The Ephesians, therefore, as I said, had a taste of it in a particular way. I do not say that they had not known love, for they had the Spirit; the Holy Spirit had come in at Ephesus through the laying on of Paul's hands, and He would shed abroad in the hearts of the Ephesians the love of God as it was in Christ, as He did elsewhere. But then there was this additional touch, so that in writing to them afterwards, they would be ready for an enlargement of the great subject of the love of Christ. Hence he said that he prayed for them, he bowed his knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. The prayer is one whole, it refers to power in the saints -- not light. "That ye may be fully able" (@Ephesians 3:18), he says, "to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height; and to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge" @Ephesians 3:18 - 19.
Now I understand that the saints are viewed in Ephesians as consecrated, and that the breast of the consecration offering being Moses¬ portion, is that which the Lord in an authoritative way brings before them. It had already been waved. It was Moses who waved it; it belonged to him. The setting of the type is this; Christ is viewed in His personal dignity here, not as dying. Aaron was clothed in the presence of the whole congregation with his garments of glory
{467}
and beauty, and then the tabernacle was anointed; that is to say, the ministry of Christ, the unfolding of the mind of God as it came out in Him, indicated that in which God would display Himself, that in which He would dwell; all that came out in the ministry of Christ in what He said. The divine thoughts in regard of the heavens and the earth were disclosed in that ministry, and then the anointing. The Lord is personally owned in this type as fit to serve in that holy system apart from dying; but the altar was anointed, as you will remember, seven times, meaning that the words -- the ministry of Christ -- burning as they were, as coming out straight from God in the Son, could only become effective through suffering. It could become systematised and made a living order of things only through the inclusion of men, and this necessarily involved the sufferings of Christ -- a theme, beloved, which the Holy Spirit would ever keep before us, as moulding us and giving us a tinge of colour that is after Christ.
Thus, the altar being anointed, the sons of Aaron are brought in and are clothed with their garments, that is to say, the disciples come forward, and here I touch on John 13. It is a chapter which involves the ram of consecration, and so the breast -- the love -- comes into evidence. The Lord knew that He was about to depart out of this world to the Father; and "having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end" @John 13:1. The breast is in evidence, it is in evidence in its durability. Love is in evidence in its durability. Over against that, it is said that the devil had put it into the heart of Judas to betray Him; over against the love that was there, the love that had been so expressed and was now to show itself in the wonderful actions and words at that supper table (covering these chapters I have mentioned), over against that was the heart of Judas. In Luke it is the *hand* of him who betrayed, it is a
{468}
question of what Judas *did*; but in John it is the *heart* of him who betrayed, for John goes to the bottom of things, and so we read, "the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas" @John 13:2.
I may say in passing that it is one thing to have Satan put something into your heart and another thing to carry it out, Satan himself having entered into you. The order is that he introduces the thought into the heart, then he follows up the thought and finds a place there, and then the action -- a most serious matter in regard of our hearts, for if we are believers and thus related to Christ, it is our hearts that Satan is after, to suggest something there.
The Lord knew that Satan had made the suggestion, He was perfectly aware of all that went on in Judas, for in John's gospel the Lord calls *him* a devil. The word for 'devil' usually in the New Testament is 'demon', but in regard of Judas he was himself a devil; such was the enormity of the crime, such was its far-reachingness and nature that he was called no less than a devil. John would expose him fully, and so the devil put it into his heart to betray Him, and then later Satan entered into him. I say this for the enemy is after the hearts of the saints. You may not have thought of that, but he seeks to get as near to Christ as he can, and to follow up a suggestion with his own presence in the doing of the thing. So when Judas received the sop from the Lord, Satan entered into him, and he went out, and it was night, and that night has continued. We have to do with the world into which Judas has gone -- it is a different world from the world that preceded it. The one who had been in the nearest companionship to Christ, *he* has gone out indwelt by the devil, by Satan, having carried with him, as it were, all the secrets and terms of affection that he was cognisant of inside. Such is the world with which we have to do!
Now it is in the presence of that darkness that
{469}
there is the consecration of the priests, and what comes to light, as I said, is the love of Christ -- the breast. And so John the writer, as it says, leaned on that breast, it was available to him. Now the secret of leaning on the breast is that one has been received into the bosom. There are two words; in verse 23 it is the bosom of Christ which signifies not that which is solid like the breast, but that which is receptive -- a receptive suggestion. The reading is not that John leaned on the bosom, but that "there was at table one of his disciples *in* the bosom of Jesus" @John 13:23. Judas was at table too, and so the others were, but of John it is said that he was *in the bosom*. The thought conveyed is that he had a place in the heart of Christ and that he had come into it; he understood something of the breast of the ram of consecration. It was the scene of consecration; the Lord, in the midst of the darkness and the corruption, would have a circle in His bosom, He would have a circle of persons whom He had received into His affections. He was Himself in the bosom of the Father and known to be there. They had contemplated Him as an only-begotten with a father, that is not only had they seen Him, but they had contemplated Him there; they took account of how He was there.
It is only thus, dear brethren, that we can rightly apprehend what contemplation means, what Jesus was as man here with the Father. The disciples were not simply passing spectators, they *contemplated*; the thing was brought within their range, and they took account of it with interest, and in taking account of it they *give* an account of it. It is one thing to apprehend what is of God -- a spiritual thing -- it is another thing to give an account of it. And so John says, "We have contemplated his glory" @John 1:14. And then he tells us what it was like. And so they laid hold of the idea that with Christ there
{470}
was receptiveness, that the love of Christ is a receptive love; it receives its objects and John knew it. He is specially mentioned as one *in* the bosom; not leaning on, as in verse 25, but *in* it, for the idea of the bosom, as I said, is not that you lean upon it, but that you are received into it. The idea of the breast is that you lean upon it, because it is solid. I am speaking of it now as used in the singular in the scripture, and as it is used in the chapter I read in Leviticus. The breast was Moses¬ portion and it was waved before the Lord. It is as if it were that feature of Christ that is to fill everything, and certainly that is to fill the mind and heart of God -- the love of Christ.
I want to show from Romans how it is apprehended in its magnitude and its receptiveness, and how it is reliable as we have to do with evil. The apostle says, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?" He is speaking of something he knows, that he is conscious of; he had proved the love of Christ for many years in his walk as a Christian, and in his service as an apostle, and so he triumphantly asks the question, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?" It will stand you in good stead against all opposition. "Tribulation or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? According as it is written, For thy sake we are put to death all the day long; we have been reckoned as sheep for slaughter. But in all these things we more than conquer through him that has loved us". Can we have a doubt as to the ultimate end of things? No one who has been received into the bosom of Christ has the slightest doubt about it. One can speak of it in a little measure; no one who has been received into the bosom of Christ has the slightest doubt or misgiving in regard of the future. Suffering? Surely! "For thy sake we are put to death all the day long". We do not wish to be saved from that. It is an
{471}
honour. "We have been reckoned as sheep for slaughter".
Such is the position of the Christian! There is no public defence to offer, no weapons of warfare according to man. Here are seven ewe-lambs, as Abraham said to Abimelech when he came to him, virtually saying to Abraham, I recognise your power, but I want you to understand that I have got power; I am the king of the Philistines and I have got an army and I have a captain. He came to Abraham having mustered up all that he could to convey to Abraham his power. That is what always marks the world; the world will capitalise everything to make a show; but notwithstanding Abimelech's general by him and his royalty, Abraham reproved him. Abraham had no general by him, nor did he carry a sword, but he had *moral* power. And now he says to Abimelech, Here are seven ewe-lambs of the flock. They did not represent military power according to man, they represented moral power, for such power is seen in sheep awaiting the slaughter -- for Christ's sake killed all the day long; that is moral power. It is like the altar that was anointed seven times, God, as it were, pouring in the power of the Spirit sevenfold, for the thing that is to stand out in conflict is power to *suffer*. The greatest moral power ever displayed was in Christ in Gethsemane, before the high priest, and before Pilate, and on the cross, and the Lord would bring us to that.
And so Abraham said to Abimelech, Here are seven ewe-lambs. And Abimelech inquires, "What mean these seven ewe-lambs?" @Genesis 21:29. They are for you, he said, "that they may be a witness to me, that I have dug this well" @Genesis 21:30. They are to be a witness to you that the power that I have is not military as you understand it, but the power of the Spirit of God; they are to be a witness to you that I dug
{472}
this well. He made it clear that he had a well, and it is in the power of that well that we can be killed all the day long, that we can be like sheep for the slaughter -- like those seven ewe-lambs -- for the sake of Christ. How is it? "I have strength for all things in him that gives me power" (@Philippians 4:13), Paul says, and so here, "For thy sake we are put to death all the day long". The divine thought is that as received into the bosom of Christ, you can lean upon His breast, and that gives power to endure; the reliability of the love of Christ stands by you under all circumstances even if you had to die. Look how it stood by Stephen! How was he dying? By the love of Christ, so that he was like Him. How much he leaned on the love of Christ! How nearly he comes to the Lord! Next to the Lord, I believe Stephen represents the greatest expression of moral power; as he received the stones of his murderers he was praying for them; "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge" @Acts 7:60. The intelligence of it is remarkable. The Lord had said, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do" @Luke 23:34. He did not limit the forgiveness. Stephen does with priestly intelligence he asks the Lord not to lay *this* sin against him to their charge; he did not ask for a trespass-offering, nor should any Christian ask for a trespass-offering. It is right surely to rebuke a brother, but that is @Matthew 18. You do not go to him and ask for a trespass-offering; you go to him to recover him, to gain him. If you cannot gain him yourself, you take another, and if you cannot gain him by taking another, you tell it to the assembly. It is no question of separation, it is a question of recovery, and that was the spirit of Stephen. Stephen did not need a trespass-offering; he had enough, he was full, he was full of Christ. I need not dwell upon it, you know the beautiful passage; it always appeals to the heart. And so Romans gives us the love of Christ standing by us in conflict with evil in this
{473}
world; it *never* fails us. "We more than conquer through him that has loved us".
In the last scripture that I read, 2 Corinthians 5, it is the love of Christ in its constraining power, constraining us to a right judgment of things. "The love of the Christ", says the apostle, "constrains us, having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died". There is no one at all in view now; it is not a question of your life towards the world, and conflict, it is the way into new creation. We know very little about new creation; I feel that for myself, and hence the importance of understanding the constraint, the constraining power of the love of Christ, for He would lead us into it. He would support us in conflict in every circumstance so that we might be like Himself in it, that we might be in accord with the altar and the sufferings involved, but the other side is that He would lead us into new creation. There *is* such a thing. It is not here that I am a new creature exactly, for the word is not 'a new creature', but "new creation". "If any one be in Christ, *there is* a new creation", and that refers to the work of God. Sometimes we speak of the new man and new creation and say it is seen in Christ, but strictly it is not seen in Christ; it is a *creation*, and a creation is not seen in Christ, He is the Creator. The work of God in this sense is in the saints and it is never regarded as abstract. There is always some concrete expression of the work of God, something that can be taken account of, otherwise there is no Christianity; hence the new man is a creation; what you put on is a creation, it is what is seen in the saints that you put on.
We make far too little of the work of God; the time is coming when it will be announced that 'It is what God has wrought' -- what He has done in Israel, and in Jacob, that is to say, in the saints. When it is a question of redemption it is 'He hath
{474}
done this', that is Christ, but the work *in* Israel and Jacob is what God has wrought. The time is coming when the sum total of the work of God will be seen and will be admired. At that "time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!" @Numbers 23:23. So there is a new creation; now, it affects the saints only, as far as I understand it, but it will extend out to the heavens and the earth by-and-by. At the present time *there is* a new creation. "If any one be in Christ, there is a new creation". There is that here of God -- the work of God, by which we pass out of what is seen, of what is natural, even natural relationships, into new creation, where "all things are of God", old things having passed away, all things having become new, and all things of God.
And so, beloved, the love of Christ constrains us with that in view. "All have died"; that is the judgment that flows from the constraining power of the love of Christ. If He died for all, then all had died. It is the reckoning of love, the reckoning of one who is under the constraining power of the love of Christ; so that all have died, all are out of the way, and those who live do not live unto themselves. They are not selfish; everything in regard of love is unselfish. And so you get in the gift of Christ, God gave His *own* Son, spared not His own Son. There was unselfishness! God is unselfish, Christ is unselfish; "himself bore our sins in his body on the tree" @1 Peter 2:24. Unselfishness marks love from the outset to the finish, and as it constrains us, what marks us is unselfishness; we do not live to ourselves but to Him who died for us and rose again.
Then the apostle makes bold and goes further; he says, We henceforth know no one according to flesh. He is looking at the work of God in the saints. As regards Christ, He is no longer in the flesh, He is risen, having died; as regards the saints, they are the subjects of the work of God, and if you look on them
{475}
from that standpoint you are not regarding them after the flesh. That is how we enter upon our privilege -- new creation. It is our ability in unselfishness, as living to Christ who died for us and rose again, to take account of the saints as the subjects of the work of God. If any one be in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things have passed away, all things are become new, and all things are of God.
Well, you will see, I think, the wonderful character of the love of Christ, how practical it is as known, how it stands by us in every circumstance here, and how it constrains us in the blessedness of new creation, where all things are of God.
{476}
THE REPROACH OF CHRIST
@Hebrews 11:24 - 26; @2 Kings 5:1 - 3; @2 Kings 7:3 - 9; @2 Chronicles 18:6 - 8
I have before me to speak about the reproach of Christ, and to show you how it marked those who were effective in the service and testimony of God.
In referring to it one is reminded of the Lord's words, "Reproach hath broken my heart" @Psalm 69:20. @Psalm 69 depicts His sufferings, particularly towards the end of His pathway of service here, and what comes out in it is repeated reference to reproach. He said to Jehovah, "The reproaches of them that reproach thee have fallen upon me" @Psalm 69:9. Thus we see how completely the idea of representation marked Christ; representation of God brought upon Him the reproaches that were directed against God. He was, as here, completely the representation of God. He is spoken of indeed as the "image of the invisible God" @Colossians 1:15. It is well to bear in mind the invisibility of God, that God is invisible. Many statements in Scripture may seem to be contradictory to this, as, for instance, in @Exodus 24, where it is said that Moses and the elders saw the God of Israel; and again in the Lord's own words, speaking of little ones, "their angels in the heavens continually behold the face of my Father who is in the heavens" (@Matthew 18:10), and many like expressions, so that many have assumed that God is seen in some personal way, in spite of the repeated statement of Scripture that no one has seen Him. John says, "No one has seen God at any time" (@John 1:18), and then even after the revelation of God in Christ, Paul says, "dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen nor is able to see" @1 Timothy 6:16. So that we must understand that God in His infinite Being -- His essential Being -- is far beyond our power of comprehension, in so far as the infinite is beyond the finite.
{477}
How the scriptures which speak of His being seen can be explained, is a matter for patient inquiry; but we have to dismiss all idea of God being apprehended in any personal way, save as in Christ. There is a sense in which He may be apprehended attributively, that is, in the physical creation, for it is said that "the invisible things of him are perceived, being apprehended by the mind through the things that are made, both his eternal power and divinity" (@Romans 1:20); but "the things that are made" are not personal, and so they do not present God in His essential Being. God is also seen in that world where everything is of Him -- the world of new creation, where all things are of God. We can understand how much there is to be seen that speaks of God there; but when we come to His essential Being it is in Christ only that He is seen, both now and in eternity. Nevertheless, although He is invisible, dwelling in light unapproachable, whom no man hath seen or can see, there was, as I said, that which was known of Him among men. There was all His beneficence and goodness, first in the garden and then in the rain and fruitful seasons, then in the law; but in spite of all these things, God was in reproach in this world, and so the Lord says, "The reproaches of them that reproach thee are fallen upon me" (@Psalm 69:9), and that not partially so, but altogether so, for He was the complete representation of God, He was the image of the invisible God. Man discerned it, Satan discerned it, and so the reproaches fell upon Him in all their weight. He says in that psalm, "Reproach hath broken my heart" @Psalm 69:20; He was conscious of it.
It was that which Moses esteemed, and I hope we shall all esteem it; "esteeming the reproach of the Christ", it says. I wish to work out this great and interesting subject from Moses because he is taken up by the Spirit of God, singled out, as one who esteemed it. I have particularly in view vessels of service,
{478}
working the thought out to the great vessel of the testimony -- the assembly. It began with reproach, and I make bold to say, it is ending with reproach. One would not assume anything different from that, for one believes that the end will be according to the beginning in every way, not in quantity, but in quality, and the quality is lustred by reproach, the reproach of Christ.
Now, as I say, I take it up in Moses, who is regarded as a great servant of God in the Old Testament; indeed, the first official servant, as we may say. As God begins anything we get certain features that mark it throughout, and this feature -- reproach -- as I hope to show, has marked the servants of the testimony from the outset, and it will mark them to the end. It is said of Moses, "when he had become great", that is to say, when he had arrived at a period of his life when he was capable spiritually of making a choice, "he ... refused to be called son of Pharaoh's daughter; choosing rather to suffer affliction along with the people of God ... esteeming the reproach of the Christ". Some of you may wonder how the reproach of Christ could be known by Moses. Sometimes we assume that Abraham, Jacob or Moses could address a company of Christians, but it is an entire mistake to think so. Their intelligence was only partial; it is the Holy Spirit who says that Moses esteemed the reproach of Christ. He never gave it that name. It is the Spirit of God who names the features of the Old Testament saints; hence in the long list in @Hebrews 11 we have the Holy Spirit naming faith, naming certain incidents in the Old Testament servants by the designation -- 'faith'. If you look back to the Old Testament you will find the word is not used in this way in connection with these men, but the Holy Spirit speaks of it in the persons mentioned; the thing was there.
Thus the Holy Spirit goes back and shows us what
{479}
marked these men, and so the reproach of Christ comes to light as the thing that Moses esteemed. It is not the mere incident when service began that the Holy Spirit means us to understand, it is the reproach of Christ. The reproach of Christ has marked service ever since and will still mark it. There will be no reproach of Christ in the millennium; while it is a reproach in the world to be a Christian today, in the millennium it will be a reproach *not* to be a believer and a follower of Christ. And so the great idea of service which took form in Moses was marked by the reproach of Christ, and what I would mention further before passing on is that that reproach was bound up with the people of God. Christ was not there, I need not say. He was still "in the form of God" (@Philippians 2:6), but certain features of Christ had already taken form in the people of God. There was divine care and culture; God had Christ before Him, so that in all the care expended on Israel God had intended to work out some features of Christ, and one feature of Christ at that time was that they were in reproach, they were *Hebrews*. The word is found in the early chapters of Exodus frequently. The people were regarded as Hebrews by the Egyptians, and this was accepted by them; shepherds were an abomination to the Egyptians.
Joseph made no effort to conceal from Pharaoh that his family were shepherds, not that he did not know the antipathy of the Egyptians to shepherds; they came into Egypt as shepherds; they came in under a favourable government and hence the reproach was not at first felt, not until there arose another king who knew not Joseph, then the Hebrew male children must not live. The Egyptian king knew instinctively the danger that threatened him by their multiplication. They were Hebrews; they were foreigners; they had no right in Egypt; they were under reproach. This thought was current in
{480}
court, and Moses would know the attitude of the court towards them; but when he came to years he elected to identify himself with them. He speaks of them as Pharaoh would speak of them, as Hebrews, but they were his brethren. And that is a word for every young person here. Those who are related to Christ in this world are under reproach; you must not patronise them; if you are to identify yourself with them it must be as your brethren. And so Moses identifies himself with the despised Hebrews, he went out unto his brethren. You call them Hebrews, he says; I admit it; they are foreigners, but they are my brethren, and the Holy Spirit says it was esteeming the reproach of Christ. God had Christ in view in causing them to come into Egypt, and they were under reproach -- but God had brought them there, and so Moses identifies himself with the despised people called Hebrews as his brethren. Well, this was the beginning of official service; not that he had as yet entered on it, but that which marked the man was seen beforehand.
Now as to 2 Kings 5. I intend to make this address as practical as possible, because after all it is a question of what is practicable, and if we are to be here as representative of Christ, we must accept the reproach. You say it is here, but it is of great value. Moses *esteemed* it greater riches than the treasures of Egypt -- the leading country of the day; he passes by the treasures of Egypt, for the reproach of Christ is more valuable to him. How delightful to God! The Holy Spirit refers back to that incident, "when he had become great", and He says it was esteeming the reproach of Christ.
I want to show now how we can be supported in the position. This might be seen and set forth in Moses, but in @2 Kings 5 the little maid is a concrete example of support, of how the believer may be supported in the position of reproach. What comes out
{481}
in this passage is that she was suffering governmentally; and it is well that we should accept that we are all suffering governmentally. The failure of the assembly involves governmental suffering for the believer. It may not have occurred to some of us, but we are suffering enormously. We are suffering the consequences of that which attaches to the public body; we cannot avoid it. This little maid was suffering under the government of God. The Syrian bands had gone out and she was made a captive. She was in the house of a great man in Syria, and what I want to point out is that she does not complain, there is no feeling of national resentment, and I believe the reason is that she is the normal product of what is set forth in chapter 4, that is, she was great inwardly. We shall never accept the government of God save as we are great inwardly. We can afford then to be small outwardly, and even in the most trying position to be above the circumstances so as to be like God -- a great moral triumph. Typically the little maid was an Ephesian. The greater one is, the easier it is to become small outwardly, and to be perfectly content in our smallness; we are thus more than satisfied.
In chapter 4 we have one who was in debt and who was righteously under governmental dealings; the debtor would take her sons; that was a matter of righteousness, but deliverance comes in by the Spirit; righteousness is met by the oil. What follows that, is the Shunammite as a "wealthy woman" @2 Kings 4:8. This woman is particularly mentioned by the Spirit, and what comes to light in her is that she recognised the prophet, not as a man who wrought miracles, but as a holy man of God, for it was that which attracted her attention. She was a wealthy woman in that she could pay her debts and live of the rest, also in that she could accommodate the prophet, recognising him as a holy man of God. Ability to discern a holy man
{482}
of God will keep you from persons who would lead you astray. You thus pass, as it were, from Romans to Colossians. What distinguished Peter in the great drift away from Christ (@John 6) was that he discerned Him to be "the holy one of God" @John 6:69. Then this woman gets a son, and the son dies; she is passing on from the greatness acquired by the Spirit into the knowledge of Christ personally as "risen from the dead" @Matthew 28:7. She receives the son back again from the dead, she apprehends Christ typically as risen. Then afterwards you get the man from Baal-shalisha who brings bread of the firstfruits, barley loaves, which points to heaven -- the place in which all our blessings are, for in Ephesians it is not only the blessings but where they are: "in the heavenlies, in Christ" @Ephesians 1:3.
Now I apprehend this little maid is the product of all that, and I speak of it feelingly because it should enter into all of us, particularly in those who serve. We are bound to accept the government of God, in spite of the fact that we may be separated from vessels "to dishonour" @2 Timothy 2:20. As understanding the truth of Romans, Colossians and Ephesians, that is, the whole Christian truth, we are prepared for all circumstances, and we are little in our own eyes. Typically she was full of Christ, and so she says -- for her heart is full -- "Oh, would that my lord were before the prophet that is in Samaria! then he would cure him of his leprosy". There is no question in her mind, her heart is so full of Christ typically that she speaks with the utmost definiteness. And so it is at the present time as we accept the full truth, we accept also the governmental circumstances, we are not national, and we are not resentful of oppression. She says, "He would cure him of his leprosy".
I pass on now to chapter 7. These lepers represent another feature; they represent the saints of God suffering governmentally surely, but more than that, they accept the discerned judgment of God. The
{483}
presence of leprosy was determined by the priests, and these four lepers were in the public acceptance of the judgment of God as thus arrived at as to themselves. And what is that in our case, beloved, but that we are leprous. The apostle Paul did not shrink from saying that he was the chief of sinners; he accepted the judgment of God on himself; he knew, moreover, that in him, that is in his flesh, no good dwelt. It is a question of discerned judgment, not only based on external evidence, but by close contact. It is by the Spirit of God that we learn what we really are; there is no pretension to hide the fact. There are people who accept the discerned judgment of God. Simon the leper had a public reputation, but he did not hide it. Well, the Lord was in his house, and it was morally right that He should be there, that He should be in the house of one who accepted the judgment of God as to himself. And so @Romans 7 should be gone into and we should understand as by the Spirit what we really are and own it.
In @Revelation 5:6 we read that the Lamb has seven eyes; I understand that to be the power of discernment. There is nothing bid from His eyes, nor from the eyes of the Spirit. It is said that the Lord walks among the seven golden candlesticks, so that we have the judgment of God as to the public body, and there are those on the earth who accept it, and that is a great testimony to God. We have discerned by the Spirit of God that we are sinful and that God sent His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and has through Him condemned sin in the flesh. And there are those who are known to accept this judgment of God. That brings us under reproach; we are ready to be ostracised. We stand over against the world, building itself up as if man were anything, as if he were a development. There are those in this world who own the judgment of God as to man. "What man is, is known", @Ecclesiastes 6:10.
{484}
Thus of necessity we do not fit into this world which would make something of man. Man is leprous, and there are those who accept this fact. Those in this position, however, have the light of God. They do not assume to be evangelists, they have no commission, that is not the point here, but the light of God is with them, they know God, they have been with Him. Like the poor lepers, they have found it out by going to the spot and finding the enemy was routed, and so it is we know it, and we know something of what accrues; we have appropriated those riches and so being moved by right sympathies we go and tell other people. We are in the light that these four ostracised men had for the king and the people. Let us not refrain from accepting the judgment of God upon men, for then we get the light and wealth that accrue from the death of Christ, and we desire and are willing to share these riches. There were four men, suggesting the universal value of these things. What a marvellous position the assembly holds! The very acceptance of the position makes you a custodian of the light.
I refer now to the passage in @2 Chronicles 18:6 - 8. Micaiah was a man who was known to have the place of a prophet. I have no doubt there is development in these passages. Ahab says in answer to Jehoshaphat, "There is yet one man, by whom we may inquire of Jehovah: but I hate him". On the other hand there were four hundred prophets, but they were prophets of Ahab. There are many more than four hundred today in that position, who are under the control of men in this world who patronise them, and upon whom indeed they are dependent. There were four hundred of them in that day. I need not go over the ground, how they were telling lies to Ahab and flattering him, and they were professedly prophets of the Lord. Alas! that this kind of thing should be occurrent! But Micaiah is a man who is known to
{485}
be a prophet, and men know that certain persons have the truth, and they come to them, but they hate them nevertheless. Why do they hate them? Because they tell the truth. Ahab says of Micaiah, "He prophesies no good concerning me". He was not a liar, he was known to be a prophet of God, even Ahab recognised he was a prophet, but he says he is different from any of the other prophets, for he always says what is evil not good as to me. So it is with those representative of God; they incur the enmity of man, they are under reproach, but they have the great honour of representing God. And so Micaiah suffers, but he is honoured.
Thus we have indicated in these instances the features of public witness at the present time -- the reproach of Christ marking us, so as to be effective and to be representative of God and of Christ in this world. We need not shrink from the idea of representation. It is a divine principle, and I believe God will have it at the end as He had it at the beginning, and those at the beginning accepted the reproach. The first mention of Christ in a public way by the apostles is that He was a Nazaraean. Peter says on the day of Pentecost, "Jesus the Nazaraean" (@Acts 2:22) and then later, "In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazaraean rise up and walk" @Acts 3:6. Matthew too says, "He shall be called a Nazaraene" @Matthew 2:23. The prophets had witnessed to it; it was the tenor of the prophets that Christ should be called a Nazaraean, should be in reproach among men, and His followers were known as a sect of the Nazaraeans; @Acts 24:5. They were under reproach, and they accepted it; they made no effort to hide it, and the power of God was with them, and so it will be as we accept the reproach of Christ.
{486}
THE UNITY OF THE SPIRIT
@Ephesians 4:1 - 3; @Numbers 7:10 - 17; @Acts 4:36,37; @Acts 11:19 - 30; @Acts 13:1 - 3; @Acts 15:1 - 4
I have been exercised in regard to this meeting to speak a little about the unity of the Spirit, and in thinking over it, it appears to me that in Scripture it is connected with the thought of princes. The unity of the Spirit is a universal thought; you may recall the word in @Psalm 45 in regard to the saints: "princes shalt thou make them in all the earth" (@Psalm 45:16); without a goodly distribution of princes universally, we can scarcely look for the unity of the Spirit, in fact we shall be little better than nonconformist communities, which means that we are non-catholic and in a great measure local independencies. Hence the importance, as I have said, of a goodly distribution of princes according to God abroad among the saints. The means of establishing princes is here on earth, and the psalm I referred to indicates that it is a divine thought that they should be in *all* the earth, which means a general or universal distribution. The Levites of old as a levitical family were to be distributed throughout the land for the same reason that there should be an equalisation and a generalisation of heavenly influence, so that the same traits, the same feelings, and the same sympathies should mark all the people of God.
The idea of princes is very old, for you will remember it is in Jacob that it is set out; as he was on his way back from Padan-aram God met him, and said that his name henceforth would be Israel, which means prince of God, and there can be no princely state or dignity apart from a transaction with God. The power of lifting up is with Him, it is He who makes princes, lifting up the beggar from the dunghill
{487}
and setting him amongst princes; so that we have the idea set out in Jacob, and once an idea is set out in Scripture it is never lost sight of, it is carried through. We find in Numbers that it shows itself in the way of unity -- the twelve princes in Israel were all governed by the same estimate, typically, of Christ.
I hope to work out these thoughts in the passages in the Acts, but at the outset I want to make it clear how the princely feature shows itself in the wilderness. I refer now to @Numbers 7. These twelve men, it says, came forward and offered on the day that the tabernacle was set up and anointed; they had the altar particularly in view; but first they came forward with their offering for the Levites, for the first evidence of princely means will appear in the way in which the Levites are provided for. But I am not concerned for the moment with the provision for the Levites, but with the unity that marked those who made the provision. There were the covered wagons, as you will remember, six of them, each one offered by two princes; two are always better than one, and certainly this is so in the expression of love. Two would convey the idea of unity in principle, so that however reduced the people of God may be, we have the means, if there are but two of the assembly, of exhibiting the idea. We could never hope to present the *complete* thought now of anything, but what we may do, we may present the thing in the principle of it, and we may do that even if there are only two of us according to @Matthew 18. The covered wagons (notice that they were *covered*) were to provide for the comfort of the Levites, they were in view of that; the Levites had to be considered, and we must not assume that *anything* will do for them. Certainly if we think of them in regard to God, anything that they presented to Him would not do; they were particular as to what they presented;
{488}
they were not to present the fag end, but their very best. And so we must ever remember that anything *will not do*; the comfort of the Levites has to be taken into account, and so the wagons were *covered*. I only just touch on that.
I want now to point out briefly how the princely feature shows itself in the dedication of the altar; it is one of the finest features in the book of Numbers, because the altar itself has to be taken account of, as distinct from what is presented on it. The fire was to be kept burning continually there. It had been anointed seven times; it stood out therefore in the more public appurtenances of the tabernacle as the most distinct. It was a public thing, and referred to the fulness of suffering in Christ, and the princes come to light in this chapter as taking account of *it*; that is, they understood that the position they occupied had involved suffering. The greatest 'prince' in our dispensation wished to fill up that which was behind of the tribulations of Christ in his flesh for His body's sake, which is the assembly. He was not passing things on, although he called upon others to suffer as a matter of privilege, but he led the way himself.
Now in @Numbers 7 what we find is that these men offered three vessels, all of them filled, signifying that they themselves typically were filled with the things that the types represent. Two vessels were of silver and the third was of gold; the weight of one silver vessel was one hundred and thirty shekels and that of the other seventy shekels, but they were both full, and then the vessel of gold was filled with incense. The first two vessels full of fine flour point to a great apprehension by the believer of the humanity of Christ; the apprehension of what is set forth in the fine flour mingled with oil would become material for unity, but the incense was for the delight of God. It was contained in the smaller vessel -- the golden
{489}
spoon; it is what is presented to God and it is in a convenient vessel, for what is to be presented to God must not be in great bulk; indeed, whilst scripture makes much of bulk for the priests and the people, the general idea is quality and not quantity. So that we have the golden spoon, a small vessel filled with that which is most precious, for if you speak to God, the point is not amount but quality. You are to pray with the spirit, but you are to pray with the understanding also; your spirit may be full of things, but your understanding qualifies and limits what you say, so that you present something definite that God can accept and which is a delight to Him; the incense was in a *golden* vessel. We do not worship simply as redeemed; as redeemed, we are to become worshippers -- vessels filled with Christ. We are not redeemed as men and women to live in the flesh; the vessels of silver are filled with fine flour and mingled with oil. Therefore, if we are redeemed, we are to be full of Christ viewed in the perfection of His humanity here, that is to say, Jesus Christ, as mentioned in the first part of Romans; it is *Jesus Christ*, meaning that kind of man -- the Man who did God's will, the kind of man that was brought here in Him. The first two vessels are full of that -- flour mingled with oil-the perfect holy humanity of Christ, energised by the Spirit. The gold refers to the divine nature.
Besides these vessels the princes offered sacrifices. The offerings all taken together denote youthful maturity; some are spoken of as a year old -- one yearling lamb -- others denote maturity -- one ram, but taken together they indicate that while these princes were in youthful energy they were not babes. The Corinthians were babes; they could not conform to order like this, it belongs to the epistle to the Ephesians, and denotes appreciation of man according to Christ -- humanity altogether above petty feelings,
{490}
resentment, and rivalries; it is maturity, but maturity in energy, as I may call it, youthful maturity. You will find, in Scripture, that those whom the Spirit of God employs are generally taken up as young men, the great need is always for young men, but young men developed and marked by maturity -- those who are full-grown.
Now having said so much about princes characteristically, I want to show how these thoughts worked out in the Acts, because the Acts may be regarded not as a code for us, but as a book of precedents. We see there how things worked out in persons, and I wish to connect the thought of unity in Acts, first, with the work of God, secondly with universal need, or need anywhere amongst the people of God, then with the service of God, and finally with the maintenance of doctrine, or right principles universally.
Barnabas is taken as a typical 'prince' of the New Testament. As I said, Scripture never loses sight of anything that is introduced, and as the great princely idea is introduced in Jacob, so it is followed up in the Old Testament and in the New. Barnabas comes on the scene in a princely way; in no sense did he appear as a liability on the company; he was an immense asset to the company, as a prince would be, and always is. Hence, the apostles were quick to discern it, and gave him his title, for every prince should have a title. They surnamed him Barnabas, which is, being interpreted, son of consolation. They were glad to see him; he appeared at an opportune time; he had lands, it says, and sold them. He did not give them away, he did not leave them, but exercised right judgment in the matter, for the more spiritual a man is, the more practical he is, and the less likely he is to be extreme or abnormal. So he did not leave his lands, and say they were of no value. They *were* of value, and he sold them, having in view that the price should be for the furtherance of the
{491}
interests of God. He thus qualified as a prince he brought the money and laid it at the apostles¬ feet. In doing so he recognised authority, he recognised the representatives of Christ, he looked upon the apostles as trustworthy; and I can understand him saying to himself, 'These are men that can be trusted; Christ has entrusted them with infinitely greater things than this bit of money that I have got for this land'.
Trustworthiness is one feature of the apostles they are marked off in that way, and Barnabas recognised that they were so, and he could therefore entrust them with the money. There can be no assembly, no representation of the assembly, unless there is confidence, unless I have a sense that they are men that I can trust; and I cannot trust anyone save the one Christ trusts, for He is a better judge than I am. And it is so that the Lord entrusts His things to certain ones, and these things are infinitely greater than anything I have, and Barnabas recognised that; he recognised delegated authority, so he laid the money at the feet of the apostles. It is an expression of humility, but of marked wisdom, and discernment as to what would be fitting at that time; and so he gets his title, for as I said, every prince has his title, and therefore we can regard Barnabas as a representative prince, and he was such. Scripture does not need to bring them all forward, here is one, and he has "his day".
You will remember in the chapter from which I read in Numbers that when the princes proposed to dedicate the altar, Jehovah says to Moses, referring to the presentation of their offerings, "each prince on his day". Each of you may depend upon it, that God will give you *your* day; much may enter into that day, and much depends upon how you may behave yourself in it. That each prince should have his day was the divine proposition, not that of Moses;
{492}
God would have all there is in each of us. Each prince's dedication offering is spread out; and although each one offered the same as the others, they are all mentioned severally. God delights to spread out what we have to offer, and to make the most of it; it is for His pleasure.
In the case of the covered wagons, Jehovah says, "Take it of them" (@Numbers 7:5), and He told Moses what to do with them; but when you come to the dedication of the altar, the position is, as I said, that each prince has a day. The offerer is in the presence of God, where everything is naked and exposed, the hidden motives behind your offerings are perfectly known. Barnabas led the way and had his day; Ananias and Sapphira -- *would-be* princes -- come next; they have their day, but how do they figure in it? A terrible picture they present! "Why has Satan filled thy heart that thou shouldest lie to the Holy Spirit?" @Acts 5:3. They had sold their lands, and pretended that they had brought the money, but they had kept back part, they had not brought it all. A terrible breakdown in would-be princes! Alas! the coasts are strewed with persons who would be princes of the congregation, but who keep back part of their wealth and lie to the Holy Spirit. Is God mocked? Not at all; they have had their day, but they were exposed; God had no delight in their offering, nor has He any pleasure in half-hearted people, nor any pleasure in those who lie; they will be put to the test; Ananias and Sapphira had to lie to try and cover themselves, but to no avail; they were exposed and came under the judgment of God. I need not go into the terrible results in @Acts 5; what I am occupied with is the prince that God brings forward early in the Acts -- Barnabas. We hear nothing of him again until the time arrives for him to shine; he *is* qualified as a prince, he has been given his title, but in chapter 11 the time has come for him to show his princely
{493}
qualities; he becomes a representative of Jerusalem at Antioch.
I want you to note that I am speaking of the unity of the Spirit; the work of God had taken effect outside of Jerusalem, for God is sovereign; He works where He will, and by whom He will, and it is for us to recognise the unity as to His operations. The danger was that Jerusalem would take offence, for they had no part in this movement. The apostles were in Jerusalem, the Holy Spirit had come down there, and yet here is a work of God apart from Jerusalem, in which they had no part. A few scattered Christians, going down to Antioch, had preached the gospel there and got converts. What is Jerusalem going to do? What should *we* do? A work of God may take place near by us and we have no part in it; God is working without us. What are we going to do about it? Jerusalem is equal to the test; they select Barnabas to go as far as Antioch -- it is a fine expression of the endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit. They had already given Barnabas his title, and now they send him forth as representing them. Does he go down to Antioch as an ecclesiastical representative, as Saul had done earlier to Damascus with letters from the high priest? Barnabas had no such letters, he goes down to Antioch and seeing the grace of God he rejoiced. Jerusalem, under God, had selected the right man, and they in this way maintained the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace. The work at Antioch was thus linked up livingly with Jerusalem and there was no rivalry; Ephraim, on the one hand, does not envy Judah, nor does Judah vex Ephraim; and so the work of God prospered, and thus there was a spiritual link between the two places; and then the Holy Spirit tells us what kind of man Barnabas was -- confirming his title, he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith -- that is, he was a prince of God.
{494}
The next great feature that comes out in Barnabas is his personal freedom from rivalry; he sought to share the work with another. Had he been occupied with his own glory, he would have kept it himself, but he goes to Tarsus to seek out Saul. He had already become acquainted with him as he had previously introduced him at Jerusalem, and so he knew him @Acts 9:27. You see how free from jealousy he was; he sought out Saul and brought him down to Antioch, and he and Saul work together in the assembly there. These two spiritual princes, as they indeed were, work together for the promotion of the interests of God at Antioch; they work there for a year, and so distinguished was the work, that the disciples were first called Christians there; they were given a universal name. It was a dignified name, meaning that they belonged to the anointed of God -- the Nazarene: "Jesus who was of Nazareth: how God anointed him" @Acts 10:38. The Nazarene carries reproach, but we never give that up, we never deny our relation to the Nazarene, but alongside the reproach there is the dignity connected with the name of Christian, and that feature of the saints came to light where these two great men served for a whole year; God gave them their day and they shone in it.
I come now to the close of the chapter; universal need existed and Jerusalem is in view as in the mind of God; certain *prophets* came down from Jerusalem, for it was no doubt the most spiritual assembly at the time. It had its Barnabas, its Peter, its James, and it also had its prophets -- men who had the mind of God, and these came down to Antioch. The mind of God is thus brought to the assembly there and one from among the prophets named Agabus, announced that there should be universal famine, and that announcement brought other princes to light -- disciples who were well off.
This passage treats of men who have a liberal spirit.
{495}
and who possessed material things. We must not be radical; a man may be great spiritually and possess material things and use them for the benefit of the saints. We must not despise material things. Why should a universal famine come? Why should it be foretold? That the needs should be met, of course, but also to bring to light what there was at Antioch -- God loving to bring out what was there. The assembly there had become enriched through the example of Barnabas and Saul. Others were there, men of means; we do not know how many. I could understand Barnabas saying, 'I was a rich man, and I laid all the money at the apostles¬ feet', but he could not ask them to do it. It was not for him to ask them to do it, but the men of princely spirit came forward, those who had means, and they gave the money, indeed they "determined" to give it, as we read; now it is a great thing to resolve in your heart to act in love and for the relief or blessing of others. What you are doing is material, but your motives are spiritual, and God accepts your offering. A man is accepted in this connection according to what he does, and so it says they determined to do it and they did it, and they sent their offering by the hand of these two great men -- Barnabas and Saul -- to the saints at Jerusalem. There again, we see the unity of the Spirit is promoted and maintained in connection with need amongst the people of God. I have no doubt that the late war afforded an occasion for the expression of love in the people of God in the distribution of means to meet the need of their brethren in other lands; it provided opportunity to maintain and promote the unity of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace.
Now the next great feature is in the selection of servants; I refer to chapter 13. Antioch had developed, it was ripe, as it were, for the Holy Spirit to operate sovereignly in connection with it. The
{496}
city itself had an important place in relation to the Grecian world. You see in the chapter the value of a company rightly composed; there were leading brothers and the Holy Spirit gives a list of them, and the list is given to us, for He now intends to use Antioch in connection with service in the gospel; He intends to make that assembly a sort of base for great operations -- an immense thought to lay hold of. The Lord had a company so under His hand that He could use them in the promotion of His work as a sort of base, and so it says, after giving the names, that they were ministering to the Lord and fasting. They were there -- a credit to that assembly -- and now the Holy Spirit says, "Separate me now"; the Spirit is operating, and again He would maintain the unity in what He was doing, for in sending out Barnabas and Saul He would have the assembly with Him. It is a poor thing if there is not unity as to the servants of the Lord, where one is set over against another, as at Corinth.
These men were going out as missionaries amongst the Gentiles, and they must have the fellowship of the saints, otherwise their rear would be unprotected. The lines of communication are to be maintained, hence the Spirit says, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul". The Holy Spirit asked *the saints* to do that, because He wanted to have them in the unity of the Spirit. The way of God is to keep us all moving on in what He is doing, and to be sympathetically in it. If the Holy Spirit has made a selection, they could not say that they had no hand in it, nor did the Holy Spirit intend them to say it; He intended them to do what they did, that is, they fasted, and what I understand by that is, that if I am going to be interested and have part in the work of God, I am not to have any *natural* feelings in regard of those who serve -- natural likings are to be denied. I am to have no favourite servants; and if I fast,
{497}
I shall have none. If a brother can entertain well, I may like him naturally, but that has to be denied; I have to come to what the Holy Spirit is doing.
Why did the Holy Spirit select these two men? He knew why; it was not because of any natural qualities, but they had proved themselves, they had their day, and you see them in Antioch for a whole year, proving themselves trustworthy men. He selected them for His own sovereign reason. I have no doubt the presence of the Spirit here has reference to divine *intimate* knowledge; God sees everything and knows everything, but the presence of the Spirit implies His own intimate knowledge of everything, and He is operating according to that, and yet He says, "Separate me now", He would not act in this way apart from the saints; the dispensation of God is in faith. God is operating housewise in connection with His people, and He would have His people with Him in all that He is doing; and so they fast, they deny what is natural, then they pray, and then they lay their hands on these two men, and they release them -- they let them go. They were no encumbrance to them, they valued them, and it was a sacrifice to let them go; they did not send them away, they released them, they let them go. Sending away is what the Holy Spirit does; He sends them forth. We love our brethren who serve, but we are ready to sacrifice them for God. Gift is never local, it is universal; the Lord has need of them. The Spirit says, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul", and "having laid their hands on them, they let them go". The saints at Antioch are thus committed to Barnabas and Saul in the service the Holy Spirit was entrusting to them.
Now a final word in regard of the unity of Spirit in reference to doctrine or general principles -- principles of a general bearing, for in connection with these the unity of the Spirit is maintained in a
{498}
remarkable way. One of the most fruitful causes of divisions, breaking up the unity of the Spirit, is persons saying perverse things, desiring a following, and wanting disciples. In this instance (@Acts 15) it was the corrupting power of Satan at Antioch, bringing in circumcision and the law of Moses, so that there was much discussion with the persons from Judaea who taught this, on the part of Paul and Barnabas, which was right; and commotion having taken place it was arranged that they should go up to Jerusalem. This is an antidote to undue localism. If a matter of discipline arises that is purely local and which requires priestly discernment, it belongs to the brethren locally, and should be left to them; the unity of the Spirit requires that it should be left to them. Certainly we can trust them, for the Lord has trusted them, and we can do so, but if it be a question of principles, or of doctrine, then it is no longer local, it is general, and no one should then be trammelled with localism. In this case you want all the light there is available in these matters. The advice of the most capable, of the most godly, and of the most gifted is needed; in a word, we want all the help available.
Gifts are in the assembly, but they are not local, they belong to the whole assembly, and the Lord has the right to use them wherever He pleases, and no one can interfere with His sovereign rights. And so here those who were spiritual, who were free from localism, say we shall go and make inquiries of our brethren elsewhere. There are brethren who have been long on the way, men who have experience with God; there were apostles and elders at Jerusalem; there are none now, I need not say, but there are men who have experience with God, who have ability, who have gift, who have knowledge, and they belong to us. Remember all are ours, "Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas ... all are yours" (@1 Corinthians 3:22); use them;
{499}
why should we not use them if they are ours? We need them; they are a divine provision.
Moreover, in using them we maintain the unity of the Spirit and we avoid the appearance of undue localism and independency. It is a question of what God has placed in the assembly, therefore why not use it? I am not dealing with the other thoughts, I am just dealing with this one point, the unity of the Spirit in connection with doctrine and general principles; we should take advantage of all that there is; and so Paul and Barnabas go up to Jerusalem, and they were set on their way by the assembly. Splendid augury for peace! They were set on their way by the assembly, and going up to Jerusalem they caused "great joy to all the brethren" on the way, establishing the hearts of the saints, and thus the unity of the Spirit was maintained in the uniting bond of peace. When they arrived at Jerusalem, the assembly received them; under such conditions there could not but be good results. With confidence the assembly received them, and the apostles and elders, and the result is most satisfactory; instead of division, which the enemy was aiming at in Jerusalem and Antioch, there was peace -- the establishing and maintenance of peace, and thus the unity of the Spirit was kept in the uniting bond of peace.
May the Lord bless His word.

THE DIGNITY OF THE CHRISTIAN SYSTEM
@Hebrews 2:1 - 4; @Hebrews 8:1,2; @Hebrews 10:11,12; @Hebrews 12:1,2
I wish to convey in what I may say the dignity and elevation of the holy system with which we are connected, and I have selected these four scriptures as presenting these features as they are set out in Christ as having gone into heaven as Man. We have first in His setting Himself down on the right hand of the greatness on *high* (@Hebrews 1:3) the idea, not only of greatness, but of elevation; then, secondly, we have in chapter 8 the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the *heavens*. In chapter 10 He has sat down on the right hand of *God*, and lastly in chapter 12 He is set down at the right hand of the *throne* of God. I wish to connect what I have to say with those four features of the Lord's position in heaven in order that we may see that the system evolved from Him necessarily takes on the dignity and elevation spoken of.
The gospel of Luke corresponds in measure with this epistle, particularly from the standpoint of which I am speaking, for whilst it presents Christ as Man and as coming into the world in extreme lowliness, yet we have the idea of the "Highest" (@Luke 1:32) from the outset. The angel says to Mary, "The power of the Highest overshadow thee" (@Luke 1:35), and also, "He shall be called the Son of the Highest" @Luke 1:32. Elevation is seen in view of the extreme humiliation. Then, too we have the heavenly host praising God at the birth of Christ and saying, "Glory to God in the highest" @Luke 2:14. So the great thought is introduced at once in connection with the incarnation, and when we come to chapter 19 at the descent of the mount of Olives, the multitude of the disciples say, "Peace in heaven and glory in the highest" (@Luke 19:38); and, in order to
{501}
complete the picture in this gospel, the Lord enjoins His disciples to remain in Jerusalem until they were clothed with power from on high.
Thus the gospel which presents the Lord as Man here, coming in as He did in the lowliest circumstances, emphasises the idea of elevation, in order that the announcement, as supported in this narrative, should be accompanied by a heavenly calling. I am persuaded that, apart from the apprehension and hope of the heavenly calling, our testimony must be on a very low level indeed. In chapter 10 we find the seventy returning much engaged with their ministry, a ministry accredited by divine power, so that even the demons were subject, but the Lord says, "Rejoice not, that the spirits are subjected to you, but rejoice that your names are written in the heavens" @Luke 10:20. So that, as I said, the record which supports the gospel as presented to Gentiles emphasises the idea of elevation and of the heavenly calling of the saints; and it is in the apprehension of the calling that our testimony takes on a heavenly and elevated character.
Now in Hebrews 1, as we have observed, the Lord "set Himself down on the right hand of the greatness on high" @Hebrews 1:3. The idea of elevation must proceed from Christ, indeed everything of God must proceed from Him, and hence chapter 1 brings out the truth of His Person. God had spoken earlier by prophets, but in the last days "in the person of the Son" @Hebrews 1:2. It is of all moment that we should have a right apprehension of the Person of Christ. He is what He is, whether at the right hand of the greatness on high, or in the manger at Bethlehem. It is most important to have the thought of the Person in our souls; for the speaking has come in through One who is no less than God, through One who is indeed "the effulgence of his glory and the expression of his substance" (@Hebrews 1:3) -- a word which we should scarcely have used, but the Holy Spirit applies it.
{502}
God is necessarily unknowable save through a mediator, and the Mediator is God. Not only has He, as Moses did, seen the form of Jehovah, but He was in it. As become flesh He could lay His hand on God and on man, and thus He can disclose what God is -- He can declare Him. What God is is effulgent in a man, what God is in His nature and attributes has shone out in a man -- the One by whom He made the worlds. But how little we understand of it! "By faith we apprehend that the worlds were framed by the word of God" (@Hebrews 11:3) -- *by faith*. Think of it! The Man of the manger, and of Gethsemane, and of the cross, by Him God made the worlds, and without Him was not one thing made that was made. It is not only a general idea, but every detail came through His hands. Then He upholds all things by the word of His power. How can we take it in save by faith? We cannot take it in by searching. Then it goes on, "Having made by himself the purification of sins" (@Hebrews 1:3); there it is no question of the sins of any one of us, but the great general fact that He has done it -- He has made purification -- and by Himself, and having done it He set Himself down on the right hand of the greatness on high.
Now I wish you to notice that it is *on high*. It is no question of *place* here, but of elevation, and of the inherent right of Him who made purgation of sins, to set Himself down there. Sitting down implies fixity, something that really is unknown in the world; indeed it is questionable whether it is known in the physical system. Sitting down is fixity. A point is reached which is final. It is not there, as elsewhere that He is invited to sit down, "Sit at my right hand" (@Hebrews 1:13) but He *sets Himself* down, thus taking up a position of elevation and finality. It is this general fact that governs the whole system; it is no question of what is conferred, but the position taken up by the One who did the work, and taken up in
{503}
His own right. So it adds, "Taking a place by so much better than the angels, as he inherits a name more excellent than they" @Hebrews 1:4. Then the Spirit of God opens the book of Psalms -- the storehouse of the experience of saints -- and cites passage after passage from the sayings of saints, to show that they understood it. Marvellous honour conferred on the people of God that the Spirit of God should cite what they say, to establish the dignity and greatness of the Person of Christ! And thus, as the Holy Spirit brings to our attention the greatness of the Person, and His inherent right to take up the position He does, we have a chorus from the saints to confirm it; their "amen", as it were.
When we come to chapter 8 the summary of the things spoken of is, "We have such an high priest". Put yourselves in this "we". It will deliver you from all earthly religious dignity, from the greatest as from the least; all will fade into oblivion in the light of the glorious Head of our system. Here it is we Christians -- "we have such a one high priest"; what we have, and this is true however poverty-stricken we may appear in this world, and outwardly, indeed, it is a day of extremely small things. But as our eyes are open, we take account of what we are connected with, "We have such a one high priest who has sat down on the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens". Now, we have a *place*. It is not now merely elevation, as in chapter 1, but a *place*, for this is "the book of the opened heavens": "Such a one high priest", not on earth, but in heaven, for there our Forerunner has entered. This should speak loudly to the feeblest believer, for this High Priest whom we have, has gone in as our representative. As there, He is the Head of the system, the High Priest of it. How rich we are, beloved! Where are the dignitaries of Christendom in the light of this? What the Christian can say is, 'We have such
{504}
a One as our Head; compare our High Priest with yours and see the difference'. You see thus the greatness of what we are connected with.
Then it goes on, "A minister of the holy places". From the passage in chapter 10 we have afforded to us the way in, and we have shown to us how the new covenant sets our hearts free, so that we should go in and that in "boldness" (@Hebrews 10:19) "by the blood of Jesus" @Hebrews 10:19. But when you get in, as you cross the threshold you find He is there, placing Himself by you and saying, as it were, 'I am yours'. *We have* Him, as we get in this chapter, and so we are entitled to claim Him. He is Minister of the sanctuary -- of the holy places -- and He enables us to be there and to worship according to God; and more, He is Minister of the true tabernacle which the Lord pitched and not man. As such, He stands in relation to the whole moral system, present and future. The Lord has pitched a tabernacle, a spiritual one, not of this creation, not made with hands. When the Father made a revelation to Peter it was being pitched; the thing was taking form; what will become universal takes form by the work of God, not by man's work. No cathedral, however embellished or great, can represent "the *true* tabernacle"; the material of it is in the saints, they being the workmanship of God. It stands in relation to Christ in heaven, who sent down the Holy Spirit, and thus the work of God goes on. He had wrought in Peter on the principle of revelation. This tabernacle is on the principle of revelation. It is a new unfolding altogether, so the Lord says, "Flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens" @Matthew 16:17. Simultaneously with the confession there was the material. And so with Paul, the other great minister, God revealed His Son in him.
Thus the true tabernacle is pitched, a great spiritual structure in relation to which Christ is Minister at
{505}
the present time. By-and-by it will be publicly seen that He has had to do with it in all its features, but it is our privilege to have to do with the sanctuary at the present time. Externally we are weak, but this epistle is to embolden us, to teach us that we have a right to go in by the blood of Jesus. As we enter, we find there that great and glorious Person who has gone in in His own inherent right. He comes and stands by us as Ezekiel says, "A man was standing by me" (@Ezekiel 43:6); this glorious Person stands by us in the sanctuary of God! I learn my true nobility as I enter there, for I see myself related to Him. We *have* Him; He is on our side. A Man stands by us, and makes us know our place, and liberty, and dignity, so that we worship God in spirit and in truth. God is a Spirit; we approach and worship Him as supported by the great Priest there.
In chapter 10 He is said to have sat down at the right hand of God. It is now a question of my relations with God. Having by one offering perfected the sanctified He has sat down at the right hand of God. He is by the Person with whom I have to do morally -- even God. Have I any question as to myself -- as to my fitness? None whatever, "for by one offering he has perfected in perpetuity the sanctified" @Hebrews 10:14. The One who perfected me is at the right hand *of God*. Need I have any fear? None whatever as to my state, as to my sins. He has rendered me *perfect* as to my conscience. It is well to keep in mind that we have to do with God. God is not mocked; the question of sin has to be dealt with and has been dealt with perfectly, and the One who has done it is at the right hand of God. It is not a question here of intercession, but of the *position* He has taken after having offered one sacrifice for sins.
I turn now to chapter 12, which refers to our *walk*, to running the race. How stable everything is! not only is there dignity and elevation, but there is the
{506}
power of the *throne* on our behalf; and our representative is there at the right hand of the throne of God. Everything is so secure; as we dwell on it, our hearts are set at rest, and we are encouraged to run the race. "Let ... us, run with endurance the race that lies before us, looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith". He is the author of faith and the finisher of it. There was faith in the Old Testament, though very little is said of it. When the thing is exemplified, when set out by Another, we can go back and see it.
Hebrews 11 gives it from Abel onwards, from the standpoint of the Author of it. If Christ is the Author of it, the faith of Abel must have originated with Him, not with Abel. Abel is not the author of it; Jesus is. He sets it out, so that we can imitate it, and follow it. He *finished* it. Abel did not finish it; every phase of faith was seen in Jesus. So we look *on* Him, not here *to* Him; it is not the thought of dependence but of a model. Then He "endured the cross", the word goes on to say, "and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God". So that in the race we have the benefit of the throne. Would you do without it? I would not. It is the thought of government, not "the throne of the greatness in the heavens", as in chapter 8, but simply the throne of *God*, that from whence God exercises His government over us, so that we should not give up. The race is accelerated as we are in the gain of the government of God, for things are dealt with by that means which we ourselves could not have dealt with. Thus in the passage discipline immediately comes in: "For who is the son that the father chastens not?" @Hebrews 12:7. It is with God we have to do, and the throne of God is favourable because Jesus is there. It is not against us, and hence the Father chastens; He deals with us as with sons that we might be partakers of *His* holiness through the chastening.
{507}
Wonderful things hang on these four different features of the present session of Christ in heaven. The tendency is to settle down to the level of religion in this world, instead of being occupied with the elevation and dignity of the system into which we are brought. The apostle prays that the saints may be strengthened by the Spirit in the inner man. This is needed to take in these great things, and that they should give character to us.
{508}
DELIVERANCE FROM THE CURRENT RELIGIOUS WORLD
@Matthew 13:1,36; @Matthew 16:1 - 4; @Matthew 24:1 - 4; @Acts 1:9; @Acts 1:12 - 14
I wish to speak from these scriptures about deliverance from the world, and of our being maintained as delivered from it. I have in mind particularly the religious world, for the religious world in Scripture is treated as representing the world generally. The rudiments of the world according to Colossians are what mark the current recognised religion of man. They are called rudiments of the world, for in truth, though they take on nominally the names of Christ and of God, they have their origin in the world and are essentially worldly; so that all the features of the world appear ultimately in Babylon. What in Colossians are called the "elements of the world" (@Colossians 2:8), are in Galatians called "beggarly principles" @Galatians 4:9. The Christians in the Galatian district were taking on these things in addition to what the gospel presented. They are called beggarly as meaning that they are utterly impoverished as set over against what is of God and the Spirit of God; however classical or ancient they may appear, they are in fact beggarly.
I want to show from Matthew how the Lord indicated in His own path the way of deliverance from the religious world. Matthew is particularly occupied with the world as an organised system in opposition to God, having its centre in Jerusalem. Other scriptures refer to the world as the men in it. You will find that Matthew presents Christ as dealing with *twos*, meaning that He aimed at breaking up the world as an organised system, so we have two demoniacs, and two blind men; over against that, the ass and the colt, and "two of you" (@Matthew 18:19), that is, two of the assembly; God meets organisation by organisation.
{509}
So the Lord, in breaking up organised opposition to God, exposes it, and *leaves* it, for we should not leave anything without giving reasons, and the reasons, if according to God, are the exposure of the things we leave. If we thus expose something and abandon it, our object would be that others should abandon it also. A lead thereby is given, which is another great principle with God. The Lord in Matthew is seen leading. In chapter 12 the religious system is seen as a house; in chapter 16 I hope to show that the system is seen in its leaders, and in chapter 24 in its grandeur and finery. The believer is thus furnished by the Lord with what enables him to judge and to turn away from the system in all its features.
The house aspect of the system is perhaps the most attractive to the young; you find family gatherings there, social events, garden parties -- what you may regard as a 'living' state of things. You say, We have life in our church, we have social functions, happy gatherings, sewing classes and dancing classes, for they have even added these in our day, for they have in mind to hold the young, and it is true the young are held, but alas! it is in bondage to the world. You find enjoyable seasons and everything regarded as 'life'. You are thus in the system regarded from the family side. In chapter 12 the Lord views the whole Jewish system as a house, but He leaves it for the same reason as that for which you should leave modern religious systems, if you are in any of them. I do not enlarge on His word here, it has its own power, lest you should think that I am unduly attacking what is around. But the Lord definitely leaves the house. He had spoken about sinning against the Holy Spirit, about an unpardonable sin, and about their own *sons* casting out demons -- a family touch, then He went out of the house and sat by the seaside.
Then His mother and His brethren come; worthy
{510}
people they, surely! they are *without*. They claim Him on *natural* lines, but He is not at the beck and call of those who claim Him thus; He denies the claim, and brings out those who had a family claim upon Him: those who did the will of His Father in the heavens. Do you find such persons in your social functions, in your sewing parties, in your dancing parties? The Lord "stretching out his hand to his disciples ... said, Behold my mother and my brethren!" @Matthew 12:49. You say, How hard on those standing outside! Yes, it was scathing language, for Satan was in the system to which they belonged. The Holy Spirit was spoken against in it, the unpardonable sin was in it, so that all natural claims were null and void. Those who do the will of God are the *only* ones who have a claim on Him, and He therefore gives them a lead; in @Matthew 13:1 He goes out of the house.
Young people, this word is for you, especially if you have not left that house; the Lord is indicating a lead that you should follow: "That same day Jesus went out from the house and sat down by the sea". If He sat down, He is not going back again; you may be assured of that. Stephen saw Him standing -- it was an attitude of grace, and He would have gone back, if they had repented; but Paul sees Him sitting, for He is not going back; you may expect Him to, but He will not go back, and your wisdom is to find *where He is*.
He sat by the sea to sow, for He will bring in another order of things; and then in verse 36 He goes into another house, for there is another house, and there are brethren and fathers and mothers; you will not be left orphaned, you will find these and you will be enriched. The disciples (verse 36) come to Him as He goes into the house and ask Him a question. It is a time for asking questions; one hears questions everywhere and one is glad of it, for the Lord delights to answer all our questions. He
{511}
sometimes answers the *questioner*, which perhaps is more important. Here He answers the question, and goes further and speaks about the assembly -- a divine organisation of divine material, a wonderful structure, the most wonderful of all, built by God Himself with stones which shall never be thrown down but which shall abide for ever, when every earthly system and its glory have crumbled to dust. Scripture presents it as the holy city coming down from God out of heaven, having the glory of God, and also as the tabernacle of God with men. It was in the house that the Lord spoke about the assembly, so that any one who had followed Him as leading out can follow Him *in* where He will unfold all these things. You will find every right feeling and affection there, but here it is particularly to fill your treasure, for you will become a householder, and as such you will become a most interesting person. You will have in your treasure things new and old, and you will have things of your own as you listen to Christ -- wonderful things that He has to impart to you in the house.
Now the part we have spoken of is mainly for the young, but in chapter 16 we have something for those who are older. It is concerned with the Pharisees and Sadducees. As you grow up to manhood and womanhood you begin to think, and you will find these thinkers in the world, and they think according to their schools. The Pharisees are those who are orthodox, but they spin their theories out of their own minds; they recognise the Fathers and even the scriptures, but they take no account of what God is doing. They can discern the face of the sky; they can prognosticate accurately, as the Lord says in another place, "and so it happens" (@Luke 12:54); they are correct in what they forecast. We are not to wonder at this, for the man of sin will say and do wonderful things; the second beast of Revelation will do great wonders. The Lord refers in chapter
{512}
16 to the "evening". I have no doubt He alludes to the evening of the dispensation. They say 'fair weather', and so it is, but they ignore that the morning will bring a storm, "for the sky is red and lowering". You may listen to them, and you may say, A wonderful address, a wonderful article, a wonderful book! yet the fact is it is written to establish the present religious order of things which is opposed to Christ.
Then there is another class of thinkers; they think nothing of the Bible, they will tell you that it was all exploded long ago; they are Sadducees, they believe nothing they do not see. You hear these conflicting things and it may be you are bewildered -- many are. There are many who have taken refuge in the most ancient forms of religion, attracted by their grandeur and finery in order to escape the confusion and bewilderment of what the mind of man has evolved. These two great lines honeycomb Christendom, and the Lord in His lead and in His own withering way would say, "A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it save the sign of Jonas". Note what follows, "And he left them and went away".
These men pay no attention to God and the work of God. If you read the books of the leaders of religion written during the last century, you will find no reference to the great current work of God. It is not that they do not know of it, but they entirely ignore what they know. To such the Lord says, "a sign shall not be given to it save the sign of Jonas". There is no need to pretend to have signs, for the Lord says there shall be none. There were signs at the beginning, but the present time is entirely in faith, not signs. Paul always taught his hearers to look at what was not seen. I am not denying that there will be signs, for there will be such -- real satanic workings which will head up in the man of sin with
{513}
all his deceitful power; but the Lord says here that no sign shall be given save the sign of Jonas.
In chapter 12 the Lord calls Jonas a prophet; He would in grace towards them give Jonah his status as a prophet in order that they might pay heed. There is more grace in chapter 12 than in chapter 16, but there is no grace for those who refuse the sign of Jonas. As viewed in chapter 12 a believer in the system might have respect for a prophet, but in chapter 16 the prophet is only ridiculed. Such teachers today have no regard for *this* prophet. Outside of the books of Moses no part of scripture has been so much attacked as the book of Jonah. They will argue about the 'whale', as they call it, but the Lord would answer all the questions, if we only ask Him. He would have spoken to them about the "great fish" (@Jonah 1:17) that was prepared, but no, they would not listen. The Lord will tell *you* about that, if you ask Him. If you ridicule, you will only blind yourself and your fellows. The Lord would have called Jonah a prophet, as in His answer in Luke 24. He spoke of all the prophets; He said, "O senseless and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! Ought not the Christ to have suffered?" @Luke 24:25,26. The sign of Jonas referred to His own death, but the modern teachers ridicule the sign of His death, for that is what the sign of Jonas referred to -- the death of Jesus.
In leaving such a state of things you not only leave, but you put a distance between you and it -- you burn all the bridges between you, and the further you get away the better. It says that the Lord left them and *went away*. The epistle to the Colossians is to encourage the saints to get away as far as possible from the religious world, and in getting away not to take any of the leaven with them; the leaven is referred to in the next incident in Matthew 16.
Now there are many who appear to escape these things, but are held by what is in chapter 24 -- the
{514}
grandeur and embellishment of ancient religion. The young are held up by family feelings and affections, those older are held through their minds, while others are held by the glamour and antiquity of current religion. There is nothing like it to them. It is wonderful in its finery and embellishments; it includes Rome. Look at the wonderful services, the windows, the incense, and added to this the idolatry by which the religious mind of men is captured. Many have taken refuge in all this from the bewilderment of the diverse opinions of men. It says of the Lord that He went forth and departed -- He left the place. We shall see what He meant by it, if we recall what we read; the disciples come to Him to point out to Him the buildings of the temple. Think of that! as if He did not know what buildings were there. There are those who assume to know better than the Lord, or better than Paul. The disciples even assumed that the Lord did not know. Does the Lord not know about your edifices; your St. Peters, your St. Johns, your saints, your windows and finery? The Lord knows all about them, for He walks about among the seven candlesticks; He has judged all that system and He has departed from it, never to return, and as a result, not a stone will be left upon a stone. (Compare @Revelation 18.) Where will you be then, and what avail will all this finery be when He comes at the completion of the age?
Having said this to the disciples, He went and sat upon the mount of Olives. The force of His sitting on the mount of Olives is that He now speaks of the Spirit, that He is now operating through the Spirit. Then the disciples come privately and they ask an excellent question, "What is the sign of thy coming and the completion of the age?" I hope we are all thinking of the coming of the Lord and of the end of the world. He is coming and this world is wearing itself out.
{515}
The Lord then proceeds to unfold His coming from the Jewish standpoint, but the first remark is of importance to all of us. "See that no one mislead you". You may have escaped all these phases of the world which we have spoken of, but the enemy pursues you. You need not think that because you have left the Pharisees and the Sadducees that you are secure, for the enemy will not leave you alone, and our safety lies in dependence on the Lord and prayer, and asking questions. The Lord has taken up a position privately to the end that we may learn, and we need to keep on asking Him questions, for it is intended that we should know, as it is said, "ye know all things" (@1 John 2:20) -- that is, through the unction. While there are no outward signs given, yet we have signs for our times -- they are signs in the Spirit, and for the understanding of these, the believer's eye is turned to Christ. Let no one be deceived about what is happening in the East or in Italy; it is not the time of signs except of signs in the Spirit, known only to those who have faith. It is a time of faith, not of sight, and of inquiring from Christ as on the mount of Olives. The Lord has given a lead, in order that we may know the way out of the world and the way into God's world.
In Acts 1 we have the final touch to all this; Scripture does not say that the Lord went up from the mount of Olives, but it says, the disciples returned from the mount of Olives. They returned into the city from the mount. They do not go into the temple, for things are not recorded from the same standpoint as in the end of Luke. We are now in view of the assembly, so they went to the upper room. You say, 'Now you are going to bring us down to very small things'; yes, you can be safe only in what is small outwardly -- a "little flock" as the Lord says, "Fear not, little flock" @Luke 12:32. The time of publicity and great
{516}
things is coming, for the holy city is coming down and will eclipse all here. Look at that city, look at its measurements, its stones; it will not be destroyed. It is coming down having the glory of God, and then, as the tabernacle of God, it will be with men.
The disciples go to the upper room. The Lord had not told them to do so according to the passage, but they are persons who know what to do as having been with Him on mount Olivet. It says that He was taken up, they beholding Him, and a cloud received him out of their sight -- a cloud received Him. He was not in view as He went up. The cloud indicates that what marks the present period is not sight but *faith*. We are tested when He is not in view; it is a test of our spiritual progress. Although they were acquainted with such wonderful things, they did not use the things to make themselves great -- they were not to be heroes. Hero -- worship is a present danger. The Lord told them to remain in Jerusalem until they were clothed with power from on high. They were to wait for the heavenly clothing before they were to appear in service. You will not be carried about in this world as in *this* garb.
The word used for 'upper' here is a stronger word than usual. Spiritually it means elevation in obscurity; it corresponds to our place as in Ephesians -- seated in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus, but as compared with the temple, a 'room' implies smallness. When you go to the upper room you find remarkable persons there; as you follow the lead given, you will find notables in the assembly. It says that certain ones were staying there -- Peter, and John, and James, and Andrew etc., with several women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, with His brethren. What notables they were! their living associations were there. The point is that it was an *upper* room; you are withdrawn there from the level of the street, and you find there the companions of Christ, those commissioned
{517}
by Him; you will find there, too, satisfaction for every spiritual affection and feeling. What a privileged and elevated although obscure spot it is!
Note that it says there were several women. The women are representative of affection in Scripture, so that they are seen here as those who love Christ -- Christ's companions who have learned to love spiritually. It is affection that counts with women, but it is a great thing when women learn to love spiritually. We are to learn to come to the meeting spiritually, it is the only way into the assembly. Then there was one distinguished woman there -- Mary the mother of Jesus, a woman who could say, "all generations shall call me blessed" @Luke 1:48. What an advantage to young women to find a mother in Israel in the locality!
Then there are the brethren of Jesus -- a most remarkable set of persons in this world, a model company, for that is what it is. The apostles are suggestive of the moral weight that represents the authority of Christ, then the spiritual affections are seen in the women and in one outstanding woman. Paul speaks to Timothy of one who had washed saints¬ feet and diligently followed every good work, who was marked too as having brought up children, for that is the test -- to *bring up* children. All this culminates in the spirit of family dignity as seen in the brethren of Jesus known in elevation in obscurity.
{518}
PAUL PERSONALLY AND OFFICIALLY
@Galatians 1:10 - 24; @Galatians 2:1 - 14
J.T. The object I have in mind in suggesting this scripture is not that we should dwell on the body of the epistle, that is, the teaching or doctrine of it, but that we might see as a principle the effect of the teaching on the teacher and on the taught -- as seen in Paul and in Titus. The apostle says more about himself in the epistle to the Galatians, as to his early history, than he does in any other of his epistles, and it is not indeed to occupy them with himself, but to call attention to the effect on himself of the truth that he intended to impress upon them. It occurred to me, in thinking of it, that the principle brought out, whilst simple as on the surface of the passage, is of all importance if ministry is to be effective; if it is to be catholic in its results, the minister must himself be governed by it and be an exponent of it. I suppose we are alive to the tendency there is with us of being influenced by what is of prestige on the earth, particularly what is of religious prestige (we are influenced at times more than we are aware of by what is of the earth), whereas what Paul says about himself in these chapters shows that what was on the earth, whatever its prestige, had no influence with him; that, in fact, knowing what his natural proclivities were as intensely Jewish, he made it a point that it should not have influence with him. So as a result we have what we may call catholic Christianity, for it was Paul's strenuous exercise as to himself first, and then in combating others, to secure this for the saints that they might stand in the liberty wherewith Christ had set them free.
E.J.McB. Our concern should be to get on the same line, to get before the Lord individually, as
{519}
Paul did, not depreciating another line of ministry, but having a distinct sense of what the Lord had given him for himself.
J.T. And being influenced by heaven, for that is the great point even in the creation, that heaven should influence earth. There can be no question about that, I think; however little we may know about heavenly bodies, we certainly cannot fail to know that they do influence the earth. As far as I understand the physical influences, what is on the earth has little influence on the earth; it is what is in heaven that influences the earth, whether it be the sun, or the moon, or the stars. There are unmistakable evidences, too, that heaven was intended by God to influence the earth by a spiritual testimony. Paul, I believe, began with that. In Genesis 1 God said, "Let there be light" (@Genesis 1:3), but it does not say where it came from; whereas, in relation to Paul, it is said that the light was from heaven.
E.J.McB. It says that he was not disobedient to the *heavenly* vision. Was your thought that, just as the sun affects the material creation, so the setting of Christ in heaven ought to affect every servant in every kind of service?
J.T. That is exactly what I had in mind, and as you said, all would come under the same influence.
P.L. "There is nothing hid from the heat thereof" @Psalm 19:6.
J.T. Exactly. "Their line is gone out through all the earth" @Psalm 19:4. "Their line" refers to the extent of the testimony of the heavens; so Paul's effort in this epistle is to prevent the light that influenced him being in any way marred or beclouded by other influences.
S.J.B.C. "Nothing hid from the heat thereof" (@Psalm 19:6); would that be the influence of the love of God?
J.T. Quite.
{520}
J.C.S. So it says, "I took not counsel with flesh and blood". I suppose that has its origin on the earth, has it not?
J.T. Yes. Flesh and blood are not known in heaven; they have no part there, and when the Lord introduces the assembly and speaks of the revelation to Peter, He says, "Flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in the heavens" @Matthew 16:17. It was a heavenly thing, and Galatians is to make room for that.
W.W. Paul was not influenced by what was of earth but by what came from the Lord.
J.T. When he went up to Jerusalem there were many important persons there, and their importance was enhanced by the environment, by the prestige of the city, but Paul says, It was nothing to me; it might have effect on other people, but whatever it was, it did not affect me. But what we see is that he tells us where he did not go at first and where he did go. He did not go up to Jerusalem, but he went to Arabia. Then later he says that he did go up to Jerusalem three years after, but it was for the express purpose of making acquaintance with Peter. He went up in private; he was not received in any special way at Jerusalem. He did not go up in any way as recognising what was there; he went up simply to make acquaintance with Peter; that is to say, it was a personal visit, which is always right. Then he says that, fourteen years after that, he went up again, but it was not personal then, it was by revelation, which means that it was God moving. A crisis was coming on and God moved, so that what occurs in this second visit has to do with the principles he is dealing with. He says, "I went up according to revelation", and "with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me". It was a matter of divine movement; it was a movement of God. It was not a personal matter, and it was with Barnabas, that is, Paul shows
{521}
in all this how he moved at the outset as exemplifying the principles he was enforcing. He knew how to move in a personal way, which is always admissible. If we carry it too far it will not do, but it is quite right to make a visit on personal lines to meet the brethren or a brother.
G.A.vS. Would you suggest that his going to Arabia was in a way the method of getting clear of what is on earth to come more directly under what was from heaven?
J.T. I think so. There was not much in Arabia to minister to the flesh. It was a selection, I suppose, and I think it intimates that he is not favouring any locality; he has no preference. Certainly, Arabia had nothing for him. It was the land of Ishmael. Why did he go there? He intimates it was certainly not by preference or national feeling.
P.L. Do you attach importance to the fact that the disciples in the beginning of Mark find the Lord in a desert place praying?
J.T. It is that sort of thing, I think; in a desert place where there is nothing for the flesh.
P.L. Then the Lord Himself gets His commission from heaven to serve in chapter 1, and He is carried up to heaven in the last chapter. Does that suggest how His ministry is in relation to what is in heaven?
J.T. It does. Then with John the baptist, it says that he should be filled with the Holy Spirit from his mother's womb, which is perhaps one of the most remarkable things said in Scripture. Then we read, "He was in the deserts" (@Luke 1:80), not simply in the desert, but as if he had the desert experience in a variety of ways, "until the day of his shewing to Israel" @Luke 1:80. It was the positive thing even there; he was filled with the Spirit and could afford to be in the deserts, and he learned there was nothing there for him -- for the flesh.
{522}
E.J.McB. Your thought is that the actual condition in which he was contributed nothing to the deposit that was in him.
J.T. Nothing at all, and it would mean the flesh would not be ministered to.
E.J.McB. Quite so.
G.A.vS. May we not suggest that having gone down to Arabia, he was, in that way, so equipped and established by what was in heaven, that he could go and get acquainted with Peter without in any way affecting the ministry that was before him?
J.T. I thought that Peter would feel in meeting Paul after three years in Arabia that there was something there that he had not met before, that is to say, it was a personal matter. We can understand it was a heart to heart intercourse between himself and Peter. He remained with Peter two weeks and a day, and we may be sure that they got near to each other. It was a personal visit, but a wise one; his object was that he might establish a personal link with Peter.
S.J.B.C. In the revelation to Peter it was, "Flesh and blood has not revealed it *to* thee, but my Father who is in the heavens" (@Matthew 16:17), but in the case of Paul, it was how it pleased God "to reveal his Son *in* me". What do you think is the distinction between the two?
J.T. They both had this thought of flesh and blood. The Lord said to Peter, "Flesh and blood has not revealed it to thee" @Matthew 16:17, but it does not say that Peter learned the import of that, whereas Paul had learned it. He did not consult with flesh and blood: he had learned the thing, and I have no doubt that his intercourse with Peter those fifteen days would remind Peter that the revelation that *he* had had was outside of flesh and blood. Their links would be on those lines, at any rate in Paul's mind, and they are the only links that abide and that lead into the
{523}
assembly viewed as the house of God. It is a spiritual formation, and flesh and blood has nothing to do with it. I think those fifteen days would have involved that, for you may depend -- not that we would conjecture -- that such men as Paul and Peter would go over the ground, and we can understand Peter telling Paul what he had learned at Caesarea-Philippi; @Matthew 16:13.
H.H. Why does Paul refer to his own birth? "Set me apart even from my mother's womb". What would be the point in that?
J.T. I think God goes a long way up the stream with regard to the vessel He uses, and Paul had a sense, I suppose, that God had him in His mind sovereignly before he was converted. I am sure He had; I believe God had every one of us in His mind before He takes us up definitely.
G.A.vS. Do you mean by that that he really recognised that from the very moment of his birth, God's hand and dealings had been with him with a view to revealing His Son in him, so that there was an apprehension in his heart of how perfectly the hand of the Lord had been upon him from the outset?
J.T. Exactly; and then you will observe it is not only that God watched over him from his birth, but that He separated him; he was separated. In the case of John the baptist it does not say that he was separated, but that he was filled with the Holy Spirit from his mother's womb, but Paul was separated in the mind of God for a *new* line of things.
E.J.McB. Is your mind in this particular subject that if Paul had not pursued this line, we should have lost the peculiar ministry the Lord had given to him?
J.T. Quite. He had separated him from his mother's womb. God had a purpose as to him and he knew it. But then it says, He "called me by his grace"; that was a further thing. And then He revealed "His Son in me", not *to* me. In Peter's
{524}
case it was, "Flesh and blood has not revealed it *to* thee" @Matthew 16:17. That was something outside presented to him, but here it is *in*. God was operating from within; thus Paul preached the Son of God.
J.C.S. Do you think that when Paul went up to Jerusalem, he went up with such a sense in his soul that the light was from heaven, that he did not expect anything to be added to him, but rather contrariwise?
J.T. I think the three years assume that. It gave him an independency; he went up, as we might say, with an income. If he had gone up merely with the light he had received, but without the experience of the three years, he would not have been equal to Jerusalem, but he went to Arabia for three years, then came back to Damascus, and then went up to Jerusalem.
D.L.H. Have you any thought with regard to the return to Damascus?
J.T. I thought he would recognise his relations with the brethren. His assembly setting was in Damascus, and he would carry back into it all the gain of his personal experience. What do you think about it?
D.L.H. I think that is good. Damascus was the opening of his assembly associations.
J.T. It is well to see that -- that all one's personal acquirements should be brought into the local company, and you get a fresh setting, a fresh start, in that way. Indeed, we see that in the Lord's own case. He went down to Nazareth, where He had been brought up, and there He began again, and there you get the most beautiful touch about His ministry.
Rem. You seem to bring Paul before us as a pattern man.
J.T. He is a pattern man in many respects. He is a pattern man here in his early movements as an exponent of the ministry with which he would impress
{525}
the saints. He carries right through the epistle, that he was himself amongst them what he ministered, and that, I believe, is one of the most important principles for us. The thing has to be set forth, and so in going up from Damascus after the three years, no doubt having readjusted himself there, he would be in Jerusalem in some degree what he was by the light and the revelation he had received.
G.A.vS. Then would you say that all these movements were a part of the revealing of "His Son in me"?
J.T. Yes; and I think he intended that there should be something gained by his visit to Jerusalem, but not amongst the saints in a general way, for the passage would show that he did not minister or teach, but that he was there in a personal way. You would have seen the Paul of Damascus there, the Paul that had seen Jesus, the Paul that had been in Arabia with the revelation in his soul; he was most interesting, we may be sure. Then we read that he goes back again, and goes into the regions of Syria and Cilicia, as it says. But while he was in Jerusalem he saw one man who must have touched his heart in a peculiar way, that is, James the Lord's brother. It was a personal matter. That was the only one of note, it says, whom he saw besides Peter. But it was worth while going up on those personal lines, for it is a question of persons in this chapter -- a question of the persons who were the exponents of the truth.
Now in the next chapter we see the difference between a brother moving on personal lines and moving by revelation.
N.L. Going back just for a moment, why does it say, "*His* Son"? "to reveal his Son in me". It is a peculiarly remarkable thought, is it not? It seems to be almost the centre of the thing.
J.T. I think it is the centre of the teaching of the
{526}
apostle, because the truth of sonship could not he brought out and developed save by one who knew the Son, and it is not *the* Son, but *His* Son; that is to say, affection is implied -- what Christ is to God the Father personally. Paul, I think, always gives us these touches. "God", it says, "was pleased to reveal his Son in me". You hardly get that in Peter's confession. The Lord says to Peter, "But ye, who do ye say that I am?" @Matthew 16:15. It is not a question of what you *believe* in Matthew 16, but of what you *say*. In John 9 it is, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?" @John 9:35. In reply to what the Lord said to Peter, "Who do ye say that I am?" @Matthew 16:15. Peter says, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God" @Matthew 16:16. It is not so much personal there, that is, it is not a question of God's affection for that Person, but of the Lord being the Christ, the One whom God could use to accomplish His purpose as anointed, and the One who would set forth life, the living God. There is no special thought there of affection; it is not emphasised, but with Paul it is. It is *His* Son. He revealed His Son in me, he says. I think that Paul thus had an apprehension of Christ according to what He was to God -- *His* Son; that is, God has that Son, and He revealed Him "in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations". It lays the basis for the doctrine of the epistle, bringing us into the place of sons.
S.J.B.C. Speaking of Paul going up to Jerusalem by revelation here, it would appear in @Acts 15 that he and Barnabas, were sent up by the assembly.
J.T. Yes; but the question is whether that is the same incident. I doubt it. We have to note the measure of time. Here it is a question of time. Galatians makes much of time; so it says, "I went up according to revelation". "After a lapse of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me". In chapter 2 it is
{527}
not what Paul was personally, but more officially, and with Titus; it was a question of the product of his labours. Barnabas was not that. Barnabas was a link with Jerusalem, one who could lay his hand on Jerusalem and on Paul. Barnabas could say I am a Jerusalem man, I have the greatest sympathy with Jerusalem. But he had the utmost regard for Paul and was in sympathy with the work of God everywhere.
G.A.vS. Then, would you suggest that his taking Titus was in connection with the great confidence he had in that character of the activities of God in connection with the testimony which were being called in question?
J.T. That is it. Now, in effect, he says, Here is the work; this is the product of my labours. He set Titus down in their midst and said, Do you approve of him?
P.L. And he connects Titus with what is universal. "Titus, my own child according to the faith common to us" @Titus 1:4.
J.T. He was the product of his ministry and of what he was personally. Now, he is acting officially; he is going up by revelation; it is not a question now of what he is in his personal relations, but the fruit of his labours. Can you make Titus any better by circumcision?
E.J.McB. With the apostle Paul the truth of sonship was not a doctrine. It was revealed in him as a joy in his soul, and Titus is the actual product of that operation; he was Paul's child in the faith.
J.T. That is it. What can you show? Carrying the thing forward, as we are entitled to, Paul might inquire, What have you got? Can you improve on what is seen in Titus by circumcision? It says he *took* Titus. It was not simply that he went up as a brother in an ordinary way; there was a purpose in it.
{528}
D.L.H. And he became the test in connection with the question of circumcision.
J.T. Exactly. He was not compelled to be circumcised; evidently there was an effort to do it. But circumcision could not add to him. They had to admit he was a Christian as much as they were.
J.C.S. This sample of Paul's ministry could not be improved upon at Jerusalem.
J.T. That I think is the great point. What have you got? Titus was the product of Paul's ministry, and although a Greek, he was not compelled to be circumcised.
J.J. You mean he was a full man, complete in Christ, with no dependence on Jerusalem, in that way.
J.T. None whatever, and yet, I believe, every thoughtful brother, every Christian in Jerusalem who came in contact with Titus, would say, 'What a lovely young man that is'. So the first mention of him is, "Titus my brother", @2 Corinthians 2:13. He was Paul's brother as well as his child, which is a great deal to say. Many of us have children that we cannot call brothers. It was no small thing for him to say, "My brother", not *the* brother, but *my* brother.
G.A.vS. Then you see the product of Paul's ministry acting on the line of sympathy, so that he can be associated with Paul.
P.L. Is he left officially by Paul on the same line? "For this cause I left thee in Crete" @Titus 1:5. You were speaking about Paul's movements being official, and Titus is left in Crete in connection with rule.
J.T. Yes, quite. He is then in an official place, but what he is personally comes first. What we are personally always comes first.
Ques. What was your thought in bringing in what was heavenly at the beginning?
J.T. It was to show that in our service and walk here we are to be on our guard against what would influence us on the earth. Is there anything on the
{529}
earth that would influence me? As we were remarking, the principle is that the heavens influence the earth, and I think Paul began with that; he refers to it twice in his experience. In his conversion heaven stands over against Jerusalem; @Acts 9.
J.C.S. So that Titus would show some of those heavenly influences at work.
J.T. Exactly. You see the heavenly product there.
J.J. There was no rupture whatever between Paul and Jerusalem. It was essential that Christianity should maintain its universal character.
J.T. That is where the wisdom of Paul's movements shine. He went up personally at first. If he had gone up officially after three years, he would not have made much headway. The Lord looked at the young man in the gospel and loved him. No doubt Paul was lovable in a spiritual way. The personal links which no doubt he established served him well later.
G.A.vS. You mean when he had to rebuke Peter.
J.T. Yes. Peter would remember what the personal relations were. It is most important to have good personal relations established amongst us; when conflict arises, it is these relations which stand us in good stead. We do not want to get rid of anyone we love. Paul must have had grave doubts about Peter at times, but I think he always regarded him on those personal lines. Hence the wisdom of his movements in chapter 1. He went up in a personal way to make acquaintance with Peter and stayed with him fifteen days.
P.L. Does "Our beloved brother Paul" (@2 Peter 3:15) show the good personal relations between them?
J.T. Exactly; that is what I was thinking. No doubt the roots of that remark went back to those fifteen days.
D.L.H. One would hardly think that Peter would
{530}
have done other than esteem Paul in regard to his faithfulness on this very occasion.
J.T. Quite. One feels one's great weakness in seeking to form good personal relations with the brethren. And it is not simply that he went up to 'shake hands with him'; he says, "I remained with him fifteen days".
M.W.B. That is quite a different thing from being influenced. It was a personal link, without coming under the influence of the link.
J.T. That is it. I am sure Paul would greatly value Peter and delight in what he would say. He could say a great deal from personal experience that Paul never had; for instance, when he was on the holy mount with the Lord, and when the Holy Spirit came down at Pentecost.
G.A.vS. I suppose, in that way, Paul would have received impressions of a personal character that he would value.
J.T. I think he would see that the work of God is valuable in whomsoever it might be; he would thus be the more attached to Peter.
G.A.vS. I was thinking that what you have said about the establishment of personal relations with one's brethren being of such importance must be taken up in the light of how that necessarily sets us free in connection with the maintenance of the testimony at a critical moment; because, if personal relations are established upon a divine basis, we shall find that when a critical situation arises amongst the people of God, confidence has been established in such a way that we can stand up for any testimony that is necessary, without in any way breaking those personal relations.
J.T. That is an important consideration, and you can see the wisdom in Paul going up in that way. Of course there is also the enjoyment of mutual spiritual affection.
{531}
S.J.B.C. I suppose Peter's and Paul's ministries touch. Paul's was a development of the sheet let down from heaven.
J.T. I think that from the time Paul was converted from heaven, the Lord worked with Peter to bring him into accord with this fresh movement. @Acts 9 and @Acts 10 show that Peter was brought into accord with what God was doing in Paul, so that when Paul went up to see Peter, you can understand his valuing him.
Now we find, according to this report, that there were at Jerusalem those who came in privily to spy out the liberties of the brethren. While Paul, and Barnabas, and Titus were there, their moral weight was felt; and those false brethren saw there was something there different from what they knew, and they wanted to know the truth of what had brought this liberty about -- "to spy out our liberty". Those men who came in surreptitiously wished to overthrow it. Wherever there is a movement of God, Satan moves too. So it says, "To whom we yielded in subjection not even for an hour, that the truth of the glad tidings might remain with you". Then he goes on to say there were persons of note in Jerusalem, and as soon as we get on the line that this man is of note or that man, we are on slippery ground. These are the persons we have to be on the watch against. They have acquired a reputation. Paul was not so sure about them. "But from those who were conspicuous as being somewhat -- whatsoever they were, it makes no difference to me: God does not accept man's person; for to me those who were conspicuous communicated nothing; but, on the contrary, seeing that the glad tidings of the uncircumcision were confided to me, even as to Peter that of the circumcision ... and recognising the grace given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were conspicuous as being pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship".
{532}
That was a great triumph; they were people of note, but, while he does not intend to pass them by, they made no difference to him; that is to say, whatever they were, it added nothing to him. He is establishing the Gentile side of the truth as he had it, and what was in Jerusalem added nothing.
H.F.N. Why does he say Cephas?
J.T. I think it is an honorary mention; he did not wish to slight Peter. Cephas is an Aramaic word signifying what the name Peter does in Greek, that is, a stone, but it is the word the Lord used in naming him, according to John's record. I think Paul had an inward feeling in regard of Cephas that he would express in mentioning this name.
G.A.vS. I suppose in saying Cephas he was, in that way, bringing in the thought of what he was in the spiritual characteristic, would he not?
J.T. I think so. There was a touch in it of Paul's appreciation of Peter. It was the name the Lord gave him, and the Holy Spirit gives the interpretation of it.
G.A.vS. In chapter 1 he speaks of him as Peter.
J.T. He does too in this chapter later. Peter was the name by which he was known generally amongst the saints, but Cephas was a foreign name brought in and used by the Lord, and Paul would have an affectionate touch in using it.
G.A.vS. He was glad to cite him as Cephas in support of the glad tidings.
J.T. Then it says they gave him their right hands.
D.L.H. We are told here they "were conspicuous as being pillars". The Authorised Version says, "who seemed to be pillars", but J.N.D. renders it, "were conspicuous as being pillars".
J.T. They *were* pillars.
D.L.H. One can understand why the name Cephas is used in such connection.
{533}
J.T. Quite. I think it is well to notice that they were really pillars and were conspicuous as such, and so they gave Paul their right hands; this was as much as to say that the visit was wholly successful. He recognised them, and their right hands of fellowship were of value. The *right* hand means power.
E.J.McB. They were prepared to support the apostle as against those who had come in to spy out their liberty. In giving the right hands, they were prepared to give support to the commission of Paul on this occasion.
J.T. Exactly. What impresses one is that those three men in Jerusalem effected something. Paul went up by revelation, with Barnabas and took Titus, so there was a threefold cord that could not be easily overcome. The power of it was evident.
G.A.vS. The truth was solidly supported.
J.T. Yes, and I think, therefore, that when crises arise amongst us, what tells is the product of the thing that is in question. If it is of God, it cannot be overcome.
E.J.McB. So if you speak of a personal visit, the point is to secure brotherly relations between yourself and the person you visit, but if you have an official position, the product is what is the proof of it -- whether it is of God or otherwise.
J.T. That is the thing.
P.L. Would you say that in Moses and Joshua we have it illustrated? In the crisis Moses comes down from the mountain and brings Joshua with him. Is Joshua the product, in that way, of the line of things he was standing for?
J.T. Quite. He was a young man, and he remained in the tabernacle. He was the spirit of the thing, you might say, but then it has to be admitted that, great young man as he was, he was of partisan tendency. He says, "My lord Moses, forbid them" @Numbers 11:28. He would not have anybody but Moses. That will
{534}
not do; we must never tie ourselves up to any one person in particular. Great as Joshua was as a young man in the spirit of the ministry and as abiding in the tabernacle, yet, when the spirit was put upon the seventy, and one came with the news that Eldad and Medad prophesied in the camp, Joshua said, 'That will never do, we cannot have anyone but Moses'. But Moses said, "Would that all Jehovah's people were prophets" @Numbers 11:29. We must give God a free hand, and young men are rather apt to limit Him on these lines.
J.C.S. The result of Paul's visit to Jerusalem was really to weld all the ministry into one whole.
J.T. It was a catholic movement, as we speak, to maintain the link with Jerusalem and yet to establish that God had a free hand amongst the Gentiles; we do not want to lose anyone.
E.J.McB. Might we have just a word on Peter's going to Antioch?
J.T. That is a sad contrast to what marked him when Paul was at Jerusalem. Peter would not have done at Jerusalem while Paul and Barnabas and Titus were there, what he did at Antioch. But when he came to Antioch, it says, "I withstood him to the face, because he was to be condemned"; and what comes out is that Peter came into the very thing that Paul was avoiding in not going to Jerusalem at first. He came under influence. It was not that Peter was wrong doctrinally, but he came under influence from Jerusalem.
G.A.vS. Correctness of doctrine does not preserve.
J.T. That is what comes out, because Peter, as far as the record shows, was right as to doctrine. It was a question of personal influence. When certain came from James, he withdrew.
D.L.H. Then it would seem that Peter had not really learned the lesson of Titus.
{535}
J.T. It would seem so, but circumstances had changed now. There was no need for this at Jerusalem. Peter and James and John were affected by what they saw in Paul, Barnabas and Titus. What Titus represented was no doubt to be seen at Antioch. But James had a greater influence over Peter than those at Antioch. It is the evil of personal influence that is emphasised here.
Ques. Was the truth of the glad tidings at stake?
J.T. It was.
J.C.S. It was the same in Corinth -- the influence of local leaders.
J.T. It is very sorrowful to think of dissimulation coming in, showing it was satanic work.
G.A.vS. I suppose there is nothing brings about the rupture of brotherly relations like succumbing to personal influence.
{536}
GOD'S MERCY
@Psalm 78:60 - 72; @1 Samuel 22:5; @1 Samuel 30:21 - 25
J.T. I was thinking of the mercy of God in connection with these passages in the Old Testament, and I hope we may see from them how it enters into the gospel, how it is seen in Romans, and how it works out in our acquiring the spirit of mercy, the spirit of the kingdom.
Ques. Did you say that mercy comes in in relation to the gospel?
J.T. Yes. I hope that the Lord may help us to see that in believing the gospel souls are brought on to the ground of mercy. 1 Samuel 22 shows that David having gone into the cave, certain had gone out to him and he had become their captain. But the prophet Gad seems at that juncture to represent the mind of God that they should get on to the ground of His sovereignty. According to Psalm 78 God had chosen David, and Judah, and his people were to go there. "Depart, and go into the land of Judah".
Romans emphasises that mercy is the platform for us. Much would be developed on that platform later, as the believer would discover, for Ephesians emphasises the mercy of God: "But God, being rich in mercy, because of his great love wherewith he loved us" (@Ephesians 2:4), but the first step, evidently, in order that we might be available to God for His purpose, is that we should get on to the ground of mercy.
David, after this, even although the anointed of God (he was both priest and king), found himself in circumstances among the Philistines which necessitated God acting on this principle, or all was lost. Ziklag coming in represents the great principle that where all was lost, all is recovered on the ground of mercy. Then there is the statute set up in regard of
{537}
those who were unable to go the whole way -- that they should share alike with those who did go to the battle. David made it a law for Israel.
P.W. "For I said, Loving-kindness shall be built up for ever; in the very heavens wilt thou establish thy faithfulness" @Psalm 89:2. That was the purpose of God and the psalm is written by one of the four wisest men of the earth, than whom Solomon was said to be wiser. It has struck me as very interesting that His purpose is to build up mercy for ever.
J.T. It shows that the mind of God is to have mercy; that comes out in @Romans 3.
Ques. Was it your thought that in chapter 30 the principle of mercy comes in for the people, in connection with David?
J.T. I think so. David dwelling in the land of the Philistines involved a complete lapse. He was out of the way when the work of the enemy was done, but God wrought on the principle of mercy to carry out His thoughts, so that chapter 30 is confirmatory of Psalm 78 -- that all was on that principle. David comes into it in chapter 30, and so again becomes a type of Christ; the sense of the awful disaster so affects him that he weeps; but all is recovered.
But the divine thought is, I think, disclosed in the message of the prophet Gad in chapter 22:5. A prophet is one through whom God intervenes from His own side. The believer in his early days can reckon upon that -- that God will come in from His own side and convey His mind. In this case the word was that they should get into the land of Judah, because that land, as in the mind of God, would suggest to David and his people that God was acting on the principle of sovereign mercy, and that they were to be imbued with that spirit.
Ques. How do you regard the work of God in relation to mercy?
{538}
J.T. It shuts out oneself as having any part in it; it is a lesson that has to be learned early in our history. A sense of it would be conducive to more regard for God, more dependence upon God, and more praise to God.
H.F.N. How would you distinguish between what comes out in connection with the cave of Adullam and the movement suggested by the prophet Gad? What would answer to that in our spiritual experience?
J.T. Christ is presented in the gospel as David, so David came before the people earlier in the slaying of Goliath. So far as the history goes, it is more *a personal Christ* as typified by David. The gospel of God is concerning His Son; the Person is presented; hence in 1 and 2 Samuel we have a more life-sized picture of David than we have in Chronicles. 1 Chronicles gives David in connection with the ark, and therefore on more limited lines, but 1 Samuel is a life-sized picture, as you may say, of Christ personally. The first mention therefore that we have of David's name in 1 Samuel is when he was anointed; his name is not given in the book until he is anointed; the meaning, I apprehend, is that the *person*, as anointed, is made prominent by God. As we know, the word David means 'beloved', that is to say, it is the Person of Christ as here on earth under the eye of the Father, under the eye of God, for His pleasure. "God, who set me apart even from my mother's womb ... was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations" (@Galatians 1:15,16) Paul says, so that the Person of Christ is to be rightly presented, and then believed on. David, after standing out before Israel in the slaying of Goliath is *loved by Jonathan* and his name is celebrated by the maidens of Israel, and then he is loved by all the people; that is, it is a question of the person. As David appears in the midst of his brethren he is ruddy, as it says, beautiful-eyed, and of beautiful countenance.
{539}
He was full of life, the energy of life was there and what goes with it -- personal beauty. Well now, the antagonism of Saul emphasises this; he became rejected of Saul, which would mean that the believer sees that Christ is rejected, so that David becomes the centre. But we may go all that way without seeing that underneath the coming in of Christ is the sovereign mercy of God. Hence Romans, whilst it begins by presenting the Son -- "concerning his Son" (@Romans 1:3) -- yet when you come to the body of the epistle, the doctrine of it, it is the ark -- the mercy-seat, the lid of the ark, which is referred to; it is Christ in that sense as the means by which God approaches man in mercy. This, I think, is what is meant by the prophet Gad indicating to them to depart and get into the land of Judah, that is, to get on to that line.
R.B. It is remarkable in that connection that he was directed to leave the stronghold. I thought the stronghold, in connection with what you said, might refer to what we might be naturally; but he was to leave that and go to Judah -- is that what you mean?
J.T. I think the position in the cave was right so far. The cave is mentioned first, suggesting that the believer accepts the reproach of Christ, and the stronghold is what he finds under the protection of Christ. But he is not to be content in all that, he is to get on to the line of divine sovereignty and purpose.
H.F.N. Could we connect the stronghold with @Romans 10 -- the confessing with the mouth Jesus as Lord, and then would the other thought be more following on in the light of the mercy of God as in chapter 11?
J.T. Just so. The mercy of God is emphasised in chapter 11. I suppose the stronghold lies in the confession of Christ as Lord, when one is saved. But the gathering to David at the cave did not involve
{540}
any numbering; the people were not numbered there. There were four hundred there, but in the reference in Chronicles where they come to David, the number is not given; nor is it given at Ziklag, it is only given when they reach Hebron, indicating, I think, that God only begins to count us as we reach Christ, not simply on the line of the sovereign mercy of God, but on the line of resurrection.
H.F.N. You were connecting that the other night with the epistle to the Colossians; would you mind saying a word on that?
J.T. Well, @1 Chronicles 12, you will remember, speaks of different centres of gathering; the first one is Ziklag, where certain persons are mentioned by name, but the *number* of the persons who came there is not given. Then in the stronghold (verse 8) certain names are given, but the number is omitted; but when you reach Hebron (verse 23) the number that came to David from each tribe is given. It is as if God begins to count when in our souls we reach Christ as risen, when we reach Him in relation to divine purpose in resurrection.
Rem. Did they not gather to David in the wilderness until it was a great host, like the host of God.
J.T. Yes. That is a general thought, indicating the gathering influence of David.
G.N. Those who are counted in Zion, are they counted on the principle of mercy? "And of Zion it shall be said, This one and that one was born in her ... . Jehovah will count, when he inscribeth the peoples" @Psalm 87:5,6.
J.T. Yes. I think that writing up goes a little further than counting, because God is definitely committed to you in the writing up, and it is on the ground of your birth, the place of your birth. What do you say to that?
G.N. I suppose @Hebrews 12 (mount Zion) is not resurrection ground exactly, but more the sovereign mercy of God.
{541}
J.T. That is right. It is what God sets out in Christ, but when David takes the fort of Zion, the stronghold becomes the city of David, that is to say, the sphere in which he has dominion.
Ques. Would @Romans 1 - 8 give us the thought of numbering, and chapter 12 more the thought of writing up?
J.T. I do not think we get either the numbering or the writing up in Romans. There is no numbering at Ziklag, nor was there in the stronghold. It is when we come to Colossians (of course we are now speaking in a spiritual sense) that we are numbered. It is not that God does not take account of every believer in another sense. The book of Numbers brings that out, for the males in Israel were numbered from twenty years old and upward for military service, and the Levites were numbered from a month old and upward, so that no believer is omitted in the mind of God. But then there is the question of reliability. God has His own way of looking at us; He may look at us in one sense as accounted for military service, or in another sense for levitical service, but if God is thinking of us from the standpoint of reliability and continuance, then there is another principle, and I think that He means that in reserving the numbering for Hebron. The numbering has in view believers not only as having come to Christ, and coming to Him as rejected here -- in the cave, so to speak, and not only as exercising the power of God as in the stronghold, but as in relation to a world that was before this one, and as having a taste for *it*, so that we can say, "We are not drawers back to perdition, but of faith to saving the soul" @Hebrews 10:39. These might have gone back if they wished, for they had opportunity, but now they seek a better country, "Wherefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God; for he has prepared for them a city" @Hebrews 11:16. He commends
{542}
them, and owns them, as those having their faces set on His world.
A.S.L. Would that be the reason why Christ is presented in Colossians as "the beginning, firstborn from among the dead" @Colossians 1:18?
J.T. That is very good; it helps.
A.S.L. That is what is meant by Hebron.
J.T. Yes. Hebron was built seven years before Zoan; Hebron is "before the world" @1 Corinthians 2:7.
W.W. Would Philadelphia answer at all to what you are speaking of -- apprehending the Lord in that light?
J.T. I think so. In Philadelphia the Lord is before them personally, "The holy, the true" @Revelation 3:7.
A.S.L. Would it be warrantable to say, if Christ risen from the dead is the beginning according to the thought of God, we only truly begin according to that thought when we reach Him as risen with Him?
J.T. Quite so, and confirming what you say, the word to Laodicea is on that line -- "These things says the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God" @Revelation 3:14. In the letter to the Colossians it was enjoined that it should be read also to the assembly at Laodicea; (@Colossians 4:16). So that this testimony at Hebron has been, as you might say, presented at the present time to Christendom, the nominal people of God. The Lord in speaking to Laodicea implies that if Philadelphia is counted, Laodicea is not counted at all. He does not say one single thing in the way of approval; there is nothing worth taking account of in Laodicea notwithstanding that this testimony has been current -- Christ, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God.
W.W. It appeals to the heart to think of how that sovereign mercy of God is exercised by the Lord in relation to Laodicea.
{543}
J.T. Yes. The testimony has gone forth, but those regarded as Laodicea have not profited by it. Therefore, there is no reckoning made of them. So that it becomes a very searching matter as to whether we are gathered to the Lord at Hebron.
A.S.L. That is the thought of God for all His people at the present time -- "raised with him through faith of the working of God who raised him from among the dead" @Colossians 2:12. It is what we are entitled to lay hold of in faith -- that is our proper place as risen with Him.
Hence you can understand the word to Philadelphia, "I also will keep thee out of the hour of trial, which is about to come upon the whole habitable world, to try them that dwell upon the earth" @Revelation 3:10. Earth-dwellers are those who do not go in for Hebron, they have not taste for that which is before the world, they want the present world, the present order of things.
Ques. So would mercy meet me in a place of need, but in view of another place? In Luke 10 the neighbour "shewed him mercy" (@Luke 10:37), the need is met, I suppose, but in view of another place.
J.T. Yes, in view of another place, so that he is put on the beast and brought to the inn; it is a question of movement, and the great terminus is seen in Ephesians 2: "God, being rich in mercy, because of his great love wherewith he loved us (we too being dead in offences) has quickened us with the Christ, (ye are saved by grace,) and has raised us up together, and has made us sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus" @Ephesians 2:4 - 6.
H.F.N. Would you mind saying a little more in regard to the scripture read in 1 Samuel 30 as bearing upon the thought of mercy, following in connection with what you were saying as to the word of the prophet Gad; how would the thought of mercy be connected with that chapter?
J.T. Well, I thought it was emphasised in the fact
{544}
that subsequently David's conduct implied the forfeiture of what had been secured through him. His position among the Philistines was a false one, and so he would recognise that the disaster at Ziklag was God's government; it was morally right that things should have gone that way. He is not, of course, a type of Christ in the Philistines¬ land, but he is as he feels the awful disaster at Ziklag; he wept until he had no more power to weep. Everything, you might say, was lost, but now he is used because he comes into the mind of God, and then becomes a type of Christ, and asks for the ephod. Some of us were speaking about the development of priesthood in him, which is another subject, but he gets the mind of God at Ziklag, and the mind of God is that everything is to be recovered through David personally, that is to say, Christ comes into view. David shines, too, in the grace in which he deals with the weak ones; and that is what Romans develops -- how to deal with the weak ones.
Ques. Do we get a numbering in @Romans 12 in the presenting of the body?
J.T. I think you are taken account of there whoever does present his body a living sacrifice has signalised himself. What you find in the gatherings at Ziklag and at the stronghold is individuals signalised by what they do, but at Hebron it is the entire number and no individuals signalised save two -- Jehoiada, prince of the Aaronites, and Zadok, a valiant young man.
Ques. In @Romans 12 the individual is signalised in the one body, is he not?
J.T. Yes, but he is not taken account of according to God; it is not the body of Christ in Romans; it is simply the idea of unity. The body of Christ is brought in in Corinthians, but only in the way of teaching, by way of light; it is the character of the thing there, it is *His* body, not *the* body, that is to
{545}
say, the reckoning is not yet full, nor complete. The reckoning is in Colossians, where it is *the* body; Christ is the Head of *the* body, there it is the full reckoning; it is fully taken account of according to God.
J.S. Do you connect the numbering with "all the saints" (@Colossians 1:4) in Colossians 1? You have the expression, "all the saints" (@Ephesians 1:15). Do you connect loving all the saints as in Colossians with the point reached?
J.T. I think all are in view; one point in Colossians is that saints are loved at a distance; very few of us understand that -- how to know and love saints at a distance. The apostle had never seen the Colossians, he had never been there. It is a question of loving and caring for saints at a distance, and that is what underlies the truth of the assembly. The truth of the assembly as formed locally is in knowing your neighbour and loving him, but the assembly to be known in its universal character implies that you know and love saints at a distance, and you love them *all*.
A.S.L. "And as many as have not seen my face in the flesh" @Colossians 2:1.
Ques. Is that the thought of love in the Spirit (@Colossians 1:8)?
J.T. That is the idea of it; it is loving like God. It is the one mention of the Spirit in Colossians and it is in connection with love. It is a question of loving those who are born of God, of loving the saints everywhere.
W.W. I suppose the sense of sovereign mercy quickens the affections in that connection.
J.T. It does.
H.F.N. If the Colossians love the saints at a distance, would Paul's embrace illustrate the Ephesians¬ love?
J.T. That is very interesting indeed. You allude
{546}
to Acts 20. We have one word in the beginning of the chapter -- "Paul ... embraced them" @Acts 20:1. The word there for embrace is the one generally used for salute, but the circumstances governing any case would lead us to understand whether it meant a mere formal salute or an affectionate one. The circumstances in this case plainly indicate that it was an affectionate salute, involving an embrace; and an embrace is more than a kiss, it involves power, it involves the use of the arms. That was Paul's part and he would represent divine love, I think, in that act whereas their act, at the end of the chapter, was a kiss; they kissed him ardently, but the word is different. I think Ephesians would bring in the kind of love that belongs to heaven. It is a question in Ephesians, not of distance, but of being quickened *together*. That does not mean 'together' in a local sense, but in a universal sense. We are raised up together, and made to sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus; that implies, I think, that it is a love that embraces.
H.F.N. I think that is very helpful. Would that flow out of "God being rich in mercy" @Ephesians 2:4?
J.T. That is how it stands: "because of his great love wherewith he loved us" @Ephesians 2:4. He would have us all together in a most exalted place, so that we know how to love *there*. When we go to heaven, we must know how to love as heaven loves.
Ques. Would Paul's embrace of Eutychus in the chapter be the embrace of Romans?
J.T. Yes. It is not the same word at all as in verse 1; it is enfolding him in his arms; it is not so much the expression of affection, but of warmth of interest and of care; the boy was dead; it is the personal touch in the way of revival.
A.S.L. The embrace you previously referred to (verse 1) you spoke of as indicating affection involving power.
{547}
J.T. Yes; the embrace, I think, involves power; it is God's way.
G.N. I suppose that the sense of mercy should ever be maintained. When Israel were come into the land, they were to take of the first of all the fruit, and to put it in a basket and to bring it to the priest and say before the Lord, "A perishing Aramaean was my father ... and Jehovah ... looked on our affliction" @Deuteronomy 26:5 - 7.
J.T. And the more you have a sense of mercy, the more you regard the objects of it; and you not only begin with mercy, but you will have a deepened sense of it when you are up to the Ephesian position.
I think this question of being counted is very searching, because God is adding to the brethren, and the meetings are becoming larger. We speak of rooms being too small, and we are delighted, of course; we rejoice to think of what God is doing; but then, how does God number? To Sardis the Lord says, "Thou hast a few names" (@Revelation 3:4), that is to say, they are marked off for some reason; not a few persons, but a few names, and He says, they "have not defiled their garments, and they shall walk with me in white, because they are worthy" (@Revelation 3:4); and their names are in "the book of life" @Revelation 3:5.
R.B. Would you say the numbering begins when the saints arrive at the apprehension of Christ risen?
J.T. That is the idea in Hebron. Take the assembly, you can understand that if the Lord will have companions, He will count only those who are really that. I am not saying that any one is not taken account of from the time he repents and confesses his sins, because heaven takes account of such, but then such an one merely is not a companion of Christ; he has to go much further than that. Hebron implies companionship; it has reference to those who are fit for companionship with Christ.
{548}
R.B. You make a distinction between the numbering and the writing up?
J.T. I think there is a distinction; being in the writing up, you are in the 'who is who' book of heaven. The writing up is that those written are ennobled by heaven; they are put down as especially noteworthy; it is more a question of persons that are distinguished when it says that God writes up His people.
R.B. When the seventy returned, the Lord said, "rejoice that your names are written in the heavens" @Luke 10:20.
J.T. Well, that is *where* the names are written; they are written in heaven; but when God writes up His people He refers to the place of birth. We must distinguish between the places where we are written -- whether in the book of life, or in heaven; when God writes up His people, it is where they are born -- "This one and that one was born in her" @Psalm 87:5. Christ Himself is there. He is accredited to Zion.
Rem. Paul speaks of some who laboured with him whose names are in the book of life (see @Philippians 4:3).
J.T. In @Romans 16 you have a long list of worthies, which I think would be like Ziklag and the stronghold, but in Colossians the distinguishing feature of the persons mentioned is that they are a praying people; they are like Jehoiada the prince of the Aaronites, and Zadok a valiant young man. The great principle of Colossians from that point of view is prayer, because Colossians is not final; you see the hill-tops of Zion, as it were, but you are not there yet, hence the great need for prayer. What marks off the distinguished ones at Hebron is that they are priests; like Paul himself, they combat in prayer; it is a tough uphill climb from that on until you reach Zion -- Jerusalem.
{549}
J.S. Does verse 69 give finality, "He built his sanctuary like the heights"?
J.T. That is finality; it is in Jerusalem.
Ques. Does mercy furnish us with the position, and grace with the behaviour suited to the position?
J.T. Yes. That is good. They run together; he that *showed* mercy is the one who distinguished himself as the neighbour. "I will have mercy and not sacrifice" @Matthew 12:7. I have thought, that going on to Judah you learn mercy, you get immersed in the principle of mercy, and the weak ones furnish the occasion for the law to be established, involving mercy, for really they were not entitled, you might say, from the ordinary standpoint to share with the others, but on the principle of mercy they were. It is a question of the state of their souls; their wills were not active at all; it was a simple question of weakness: "two hundred stayed behind, who were too exhausted to go over" @1 Samuel 30:10. It was a difficulty that could not be overcome, the will was not in it and in such cases we must have mercy and make allowance. They are simply not able to get over the difficulty and we must have patience with them, we must not deny them any privileges, because they are weak; they must share in all the privileges of the assembly, we must not shut them out at all.
A.S.L. It would be the sense of mercy maintained in our souls that would enable us to be gracious.
J.T. That is so. You have the sense of it; you say, I should never have got over that difficulty except for the mercy of God.
Ques. Would it be right to say that mercy is God's sovereign favour, or would that be grace?
J.T. Grace adapts itself to man's need; mercy conveys the sovereignty of God -- His intervention when all was lost on the ground of human responsibility.
{550}
Ques. Would you say why it is for His "great love" (@Ephesians 2:4) in Ephesians?
J.T. Everything is great in Ephesians. Ephesians gives you the fulness of whatever it touches; it is not only His love, but His great love; it is not only His mercy, but the richness of it. The full result of it is that we are set down together in the heavenlies. I do not sit down as a unit, but He has made us sit down together; it contemplates that I love the brethren and would not be without them in the place of blessing; you wish them there with you; it is part of the blessing to have them. That is the kind of love developed in Ephesians.
<blockquote>"Nor, what is next Thy heart <br>Can we forget; <br>Thy saints, O Lord, with Thee <br>In glory met" (`160:8) </blockquote>
But now this question of the law of the kingdom is one of the most important ones, because it involves the weak ones. We must be on our guard against shutting out any of the Lord's people from anything that would be in any way a help to them.
Ques. What about those who will not move in relation to the truth, who have a will and will not move in relation to Judah?
J.T. That is another matter. You have to move on without them, of course, if they do not come. Moses says, "Come with us, and we will do thee good" (@Numbers 10:29), but they did not come, and of course they are devoid of the good. But with these two hundred it was not that they were not disposed to be with David, it was simply a question of weakness -- they were faint -- and that is a great thing to see, and we must not deprive any such of any good there is whatever is going they must have a share in it.
W.W. You would hold every one as being a believer and having the Spirit in relation to it, would you not?
{551}
J.T. Quite; in fact, every Christian in the abstract you would regard as qualified to share in the good; but another question enters into it when they will not come; then what can you do but go on?
H.F.N. Would this have any reference to the weak brother in @Romans 14?
J.T. That is exactly what I thought of.
H.F.N. I think what you were saying the other night is very searching -- that whilst David addresses them peaceably, they are spoken of by the Spirit as "wicked men", "men of Belial". Would you suggest that we might come under that spirit in refusing to recognise the mercy of God?
J.T. I think it is very searching. David did not call them anything different, nor would you address your brethren in any other way than as brethren, but the Holy Spirit has His own judgment of what goes on, and although we may elude the judgment of the brethren, yet if they were sons of Belial, the Holy Spirit knew it, and gave them their name.
A.S.L. We may not be sons of Belial, but we may drop into that kind of spirit.
J.T. Just so.
Ques. Do you take it that what is recovered and shared here may be regarded as the truths and privileges that have been recovered in these last days?
J.T. Well, you might say that, but I do not think what was recovered at Ziklag goes much beyond Romans; what was recovered does not represent the purpose of God. But what you allude to -- the truths that have come to light -- we must share with our brethren whatever their circumstances.
G.N. "Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion more than all the habitations of Jacob" @Psalm 87:2. Is that the test where mercy is administered?
J.T. That is it. I have often thought in connection with that -- "Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion" (@Psalm 87:2) -- that if there is a spot where mercy is administered,
{552}
it is assembly-wise, I apprehend, and God loves that.
Ques. "The habitations of Jacob" @Psalm 87:2. Are they connected with responsibility?
J.T. I think that is right, but the "gates of Zion" (@Psalm 87:2) -- gates would indicate a *place of administration*.
Rem. The principle with regard to the weak was made a statute for ever.
J.T. Quite; it remained. "And it was so from that day forward; and he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day", meaning that at the time this book was edited the thing was in force. It is a question of how long the principles that are set up continue to be such, or do they become a dead letter and fall to the ground? When Scripture says a thing continues to this day, it means it has lasted to the time of writing.
R.B. Would you say it should be continued now?
J.T. I should say so. The question is whether all the great truths and principles which the Lord revived have continued amongst us. It is mentioned that the thing continued up till "this day".
H.F.N. One was struck by the reference in prayer at the beginning of the meeting to the thought of continuance; that enters into what you are speaking of.
J.T. Well, one has been impressed with the thought of continuance, that is, the continuance of the saints¬ interest in the things of God, and the maintenance of right principles.
P.W. In the New Translation 'mercy' is translated 'lovingkindness'. It is very sweet to connect the thought of love with mercy.
A.S.L. And it endures for ever.
G.N. What distinction would you make between expressing grace and showing mercy?
J.T. I think mercy comes out more when there is inability, helplessness, when the person can do nothing.
{553}
Grace shines more when his will is at work and you overcome him. Mercy is not said to reign, but grace is said to reign through righteousness. I think that @Luke 10 is an illustration of mercy -- the man was helpless. "According to his own mercy" (@Titus 3:5) God saves us, but it is "by grace, through faith" @Ephesians 2:8.
Rem. You "obtain mercy" (@Proverbs 28:13) and "find grace" @Hebrews 4:16.
J.T. Just so. The man was *helpless* and the Samaritan showed mercy. He was in a half dead condition, but his will was not working. But grace is that you overcome his will and the man is brought down.
Ques. In @Ephesians 2 is it mercy to the Jew and grace to the Gentile?
J.T. Well, it is mercy in both cases. But Romans is the reign of grace. From God's side everything is on the principle of mercy, because every one is brought in as dead, but grace is needed on account of our wills.
Ques. What is the difference between the goodness of God that leads to repentance and the mercy of God?
J.T. Oh! there is goodness for you even before you are converted. I have often thought of the witnesses that God gives. "He did not leave himself without witness, doing good, and giving to you from heaven rain and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness" (@Acts 14:17); that is what Paul alludes to. A man is hungry and he gets his hunger satisfied, and then he begins to think it is a good thing; it affects him. "If therefore thine enemy should hunger, feed him; if he should thirst, give him drink; for, so doing, thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head" @Romans 12:20. It is giving him things that he does not deserve; that is what God does; that is goodness. Goodness may be fuller than that, but it certainly is that by which God leads man to repentance.
Ques. Had the prodigal son a sense of the source
{554}
of goodness when he said, "I have sinned against heaven" @Luke 15:21?
J.T. He had not then tasted of divine goodness. He knew the thing was there -- there was bread enough and to spare.
Rem. He does not say, I have sinned against *God*; but against *heaven*.
J.T. "And before thee" @Luke 15:21. He had not appreciated the goodness of heaven.
Rem. In Nehemiah 9 where the Levites confessed before the Lord the failure of those who had returned from the captivity, they speak of their not having been mindful of God's wonders that He had done among them; but they are the subjects of mercy and it speaks of God as a God of mercy, "ready to forgive, gracious and merciful, slow to anger and of great loving-kindness" @Nehemiah 9:17.
J.T. Quite so. I think what has been remarked about sinning against heaven leads to a very interesting thought as to heaven in its bounty. The covenant made with Noah has continued with the Gentiles even although they have turned away from God, not wishing to retain Him in their knowledge, like the prodigal, but heaven has never ceased to benefit man; as Paul says, "God therefore, having overlooked the times of ignorance" (@Acts 17:30); He never changed; His goodness went on, seedtime and harvest have not ceased, and that goodness came out of heaven.
A.S.L. And it is going on still.
J.T. Yes; that is a good suggestion, because it shows what goodness there is.
A.S.L. It all comes from heaven.
J.T. Exactly; so that sinning against heaven would be that the Gentiles had disregarded the bounty of God and the goodness of God.
H.F.N. Would you say a word in regard to the link between the "tribe of Judah", "the mount Zion which he loved", and "His sanctuary like the heights",
{555}
and then how "he chose David his servant"? Are these four things -- Judah, Zion, His sanctuary and David -- bound up with divine sovereignty?
J.T. It is certainly a wide range of thought in connection with mercy; He has chosen Judah and the mount Zion which He loved. I think "which he loved" means that He has found a spot where His mercy is fully expressed, where He can show what He is to man; He loves that spot; and then He builds His sanctuary like the heights; I think all that is bound up in Ephesians.
{556}
MINISTRY AS IN THE ASSEMBLY AND IN THE GOSPEL
@Colossians 1:23 - 28; @Acts 1:15,16; @Acts 2:14; @Acts 8:4; @Acts 11:19 - 21
J.T. I desire to call attention to the well-known fact that there are two ministries, and that Acts 1 points to how ministry is carried on in the assembly, and Acts 2 as to how it is carried on in the testimony of the gospel. Then the other scriptures, to which indeed several might be added, point to the variety of ways in which the service of God is carried on in what may be called an unofficial way and yet blessed of God, that is, in those who were scattered through persecution. I thought that we might have before us this great subject and that we might see that these principles are applicable now.
D.L.H. Would you mind opening it up a little more?
J.T. In Acts 1 we have the general facts governing the assembly as the Holy Spirit came down to it.
At the end of Luke it is said that the Lord led the disciples out as far as to Bethany, and that He was parted from them and carried up into heaven. This appears to give a provisional position; He led them *so far*; it is a provisional position that they might be available for testimony in Jerusalem as being near to it, but in this chapter He does not lead them at all; there is nothing said about His leading. What is said relates to what He did during the forty days, ending with certain instructions. First it says, "Being assembled with them" (@Acts 1:4); secondly, they came together and made inquiry from Him and He answered their inquiries, but went further than their questions; and then it says, "When *he had spoken these things* he was taken up, they beholding him, and a cloud received him out of their sight" @Acts 1:9. Note it is in connection
{557}
with their coming together to ask (that is, it is not a remnant position, it looks toward the assembly -- persons who were desiring to know) that it says, having spoken these things, He was taken from them and a cloud received Him out of their sight. The passage conveys that whilst He was amongst them they were being furnished, and then He is received out of their sight. There is thus the beginning of the *faith* period; He is not any longer to be seen, He is out of their sight, so that what follows is what they do as in the faith period.
Then it will be observed that they returned from the mount of Olives. It does not say He went up from the mount of Olives, for here He went up in relation to their questions, after what He said to them, but it says they returned from the mount of Olives to Jerusalem, and being in the city they went to the upper room. These facts looked towards the assembly.
And then we have the composition of the company, and the number of the names, and in the midst of these Peter rises up. It says that he stood up in the midst of the brethren "in those days", meaning that it was before the Spirit came, and after the Lord had been taken up.
F.N. Are "those days" the faith period, or do you mean a longer period extending to the present?
J.T. I think His being received out of their sight covers the whole dispensation. *We* are in the faith period, and what we do in it indicates how much we have learnt.
D.L.H. Would that correspond at all with the position of things in Colossians? You get the thought there of the life being hid with Christ in God.
J.T. I am sure that is right.
D.L.H. I suppose Colossians corresponds with the forty days during which the Lord was present with the disciples.
{558}
J.T. I believe it does, but the ten days that follow have a peculiar place, emphasising the faith period. I suppose it would have been about ten days previously to Pentecost that He was received out of their sight and they were left alone, and it was in those days that Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren.
P.L. He refers to it later on in this chapter of the Acts, "until the day in which he was taken up from us" @Acts 1:22.
J.T. Just so. The taking part of the ministry and apostleship by Matthias would come in after that, his education had been during that period -- from the baptism of John till the day Christ was received up. I think the responsibility of those whom the Lord left here to be His witnesses begins peculiarly as He was taken up and received out of their sight. The test is what we do in "those days".
J.H. Is witness connected only with the service of the glad tidings -- the gospel?
J.T. Stephen is a witness. Witness is to *Him*. You will observe He says to them, "ye shall be *my* witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth" (@Acts 1:8); witness is to *Him*. Have you something more in your mind?
J.H. I wondered if witness was only connected with the former line of things or with both.
J.T. I think witness would stand more connected with the public testimony they would render, but that is not necessarily limited to the gospel, because they were witnesses to Him. In Luke 24 He speaks about witness; He says, "Ye are witnesses of these things" (@Luke 24:48), meaning repentance and remission of sins among all nations; that would be more the gospel. But when He says, "Ye shall be *my* witnesses" (@Acts 1:8), it would be a fuller thought.
D.L.H. Do I understand rightly that your
{559}
thought is that the ten days that are in question here represent a faith period in which we are now?
J.T. That is what I thought. He was received out of their *sight*; so that the present period is definitely called "God's dispensation which is in faith" @1 Timothy 1:4.
P.L. Is it a little like the priest disappearing within the old order? It was a question of faith on the part of the people.
J.T. Yes. Aaron and his sons, as consecrated, remain in the tabernacle for seven days -- that is a complete period, the church period, I suppose; then, in @Leviticus 9, Moses and Aaron go in and come out; the going in involves the time of faith, the coming out typifies the time when things will be on the principle of sight. Here (Acts 1) it is the antitype of the king and the priest going in; while He remains in heaven we have the time of the assembly, the time of faith; when He comes out (as Moses and Aaron came out) Israel's period will begin; it will be on the principle of sight.
P.L. Would the bell and the pomegranate answer to these two testimonies -- that of the gospel and of the assembly, the bell being connected with the gospel?
J.T. Yes, I think that is right -- the bell the *sound* of the testimony, and the pomegranate the *fruit*, seen in the unity of love among the saints.
P.L. So, as to the gospel, we read of Peter standing up with the eleven and lifting up his voice; would that be the bell?
J.T. Yes. In chapter 1 he stands up in the midst of the brethren and speaks; the assembly is the temple of God; men speak there as the "oracles of God" (@1 Peter 4:11). Peter addresses the *brethren* and he calls attention to Scripture and to the fact that the Holy Spirit had spoken it, and the importance of the fulfilment of it; a most remarkable beginning of
{560}
ministry in the assembly -- to be concerned about the Scriptures being *fulfilled*. Now that the Lord is received "out of their sight" (@Acts 1:9), they are concerned about the Scriptures, what is written in them, and their fulfilment. We have not only to be exercised that Scripture should support us in what we are doing, but we have to be concerned also about its fulfilment; it was not written for nothing, and it should never be a dead letter; we want, therefore, to see how it is fulfilled. So Peter says in this passage, "It was necessary that the scripture should have been fulfilled". The question rarely arises as to whether a scripture has been fulfilled. We get in the gospels the same principle -- that certain scriptures must be fulfilled, and then again, that certain scriptures support certain things that are occurring either partially or wholly; but we must be careful in that regard whether a scripture is wholly fulfilled or only partially so.
P.L. It is an encouragement to see that the greatest sorrow amongst them, the sin of Judas, should be an occasion for the fulfilment of Scripture; I was thinking of sorrow arising from time to time amongst us.
J.T. "Brethren, it was necessary that the scripture should have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before, by the mouth of David, concerning Judas". This is a very important thing. It is a great sorrow that any one should fall away, but then the scripture must be fulfilled. Then we get that the persons Peter addressed were distinguished persons: "The crowd of names" is immediately introduced as Peter stands up to speak. You have to take into account the persons to whom you are speaking; they are not ordinary persons. You have in mind, when you are addressing the Lord's people, that they are not ordinary people.
"The crowd of names" -- the thought which underlies that is the temple. These are the people in whom God has wrought, each having his own distinction,
{561}
for that is the idea in a name, I suppose. Each one of the hundred and twenty had his own distinction.
P.L. "God is greatly to be feared in the council of the saints" @Psalm 89:7. Is that the suggestion?
J.T. Yes, and "I have said, Ye are gods, and all of you are children of the Most High" @Psalm 82:6.
D.L.H. It is a very great thing to take account of God's people as such, and as brethren.
Ques. Would it be like the way in which the apostle speaks in Corinthians, "I speak as to intelligent persons" @1 Corinthians 10:15?
J.T. That is the idea, I think. It underlies the thought of the temple; what is said by the Spirit is *supported by those who are present*.
P.L. Would Peter have the Lord's message to Mary in mind -- "My brethren" @John 20:17?
J.T. I think he would. The assembly is in view in what is presented in this passage.
P.L. He is standing up "in the midst" of them; he is not in the midst of those he addresses in chapter 2 in relation to the gospel. Does "in the midst" suggest that he is one with them?
J.T. I think so. It would look as if chapter 2 was in the open-air, and it seems to me a good warrant for open-air preaching at all times; for the Spirit says, according to this version that Peter "lifted up his voice and spoke forth to them", and he addresses them, "Men of Judaea, and all ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, let this be known to you". It is no longer in the midst of any company; he is standing up as commissioned to preach, with eleven men who were also commissioned to preach; it is a different position altogether.
P.L. It is a wonderful help in ministry to stand up with the brethren in that atmosphere.
J.T. There the distinction is marked -- a hundred and twenty persons each with his own distinction. A very different matter from standing up with eleven
{562}
of your brethren, and lifting up your voice and addressing the audience as "Men of Judaea, and all ye inhabitants of Jerusalem".
Ques. Is this sequence in which things must be taken up to be effective for the Lord?
J.T. Yes; the assembly first. But a further thing to be noted is, that whilst in chapter 2 Peter stood up with the eleven, in chapter 11 you have persons, scattered by persecution, preaching -- that is the next thing. There is no question of commission or gift, these are not mentioned; it is persons who are persecuted for the Lord's sake preaching.
D.L.H. I suppose in a special way the twelve -- Peter with the eleven -- were witnesses as perhaps no others were. I was thinking of the word in John's gospel, "Ye too bear witness, because ye are with me from the beginning" @John 15:27. It appears they had a very special position in that way as witnesses which others would hardly have had.
J.T. Yes. Then they were not only witnesses, but, in this position, preachers. "He appointed", it says, "twelve that they might be with him, and that he might send them to preach" @Mark 3:14.
P.L. Could one liken the conversation and inquiry of the disciples during the forty days that they were with the Lord to the inner shrine of the tabernacle? and then are they more in the holy place where Peter stands up with the brethren, and in the next chapter, does he go to the outer court, as it were?
J . T. Yes, I think so. The question comes up as to the ground on which preaching is. The gospels, taken in conjunction with chapter 2 of the Acts, show that the gift is based on commission from Christ, but when it comes to the persons who are designated as commissioned not being available, as at the present time, how is the preaching to go on? I think chapters 8 and 9 help us. The preaching goes on by persons scattered through persecution.
{563}
There is nothing said about their being called to it or qualified for it, but they did it.
F.N. Is that in any way connected specially with the period of faith? You spoke of the period of faith beginning when the Lord was received out of their sight.
J.T. Yes, that has been dwelt on; He was received out of their sight and they returned from the mount of Olives, that is the starting point -- it was a sabbath day's journey from Jerusalem.
F.N. We are not to look on this position of faith as a position of weakness.
J.T. Not at all. The two things go together. They go back to the city from the mount of Olives, and then we have the distance; they go to the upper room, that is to say, it is a faith period in which the Spirit is recognised and in which obscurity is accepted -- it is elevation in obscurity. The temple would represent the sight period. The disciples had called attention to its greatness, but the Lord said that not a stone in it would be left on another.
F.N. Do you connect persecution with the period of faith?
J.T. Yes. But it is well to see the start -- beginning with the mount of Olives and the deliberate going to the upper room. They could have said a great deal in a public way, but they did not do so at first; they went to the upper room, and you have Peter's address in the midst of the brethren -- that is how things stand.
F.W.J. And does not verse 13 give us assembly material?
J.T. Yes. The *names* would point to the spiritual distinction that each person in the assembly has. It is a poor thing if I am in the assembly without any spiritual distinction. I doubt if anyone is of much value in it if he has not some spiritual distinction.
{564}
Ques. Would preaching the 'word' be the same thing as preaching the gospel? Timothy is exhorted to preach the word.
J.T. I think the word is general; we read of the glad tidings of the word; @Acts 8:4.
Rem. It says of Philip that he preached the Christ.
J.T. Yes, and that brings us to the point we wish to reach. Those scattered went and preached, it says, but we have one man specially distinguished, and the Holy Spirit lights on him and goes through with him, so that we may see how in what we may call promiscuous preaching, gift may be developed. The Spirit dwells on one man -- Philip -- and what he does. He went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ unto them; that is, Philip would convey to his hearers the fact that *he* is not doing the work, it is "the Christ" (@Acts 8:5), and He is the One who effects everything. He preached the Christ unto them; his hearers would understand that God was doing something, and that He had a Man by whom He was doing it, and to confirm that, you have miracles effected by Philip; it is a question of evidence that God is doing something. The preaching is of no value unless God is doing something, and that He has a Man by whom He can do things. That man is not Philip, it is Christ, and that is the impression you would have got from Philip, if you had heard him preach.
Ques. Would you connect the power of God definitely with gift?
J.T. Quite. How does Philip's gift come out? Not in the way he was taken up, like Peter and John, but in the way he qualified in his work. At the present time there is so much need for service of this kind, but how can we know brethren have gift until they begin to preach?
{565}
P.L. So later he is called "the evangelist" @Acts 21:8.
J.T. Yes, the only one who is, showing that a man qualifies for his position by his work in the service of God. So it says that an angel of the Lord spoke to him. If a brother starts out to preach, it will soon become evident whether or not he has gift. If he has not, he cannot expect the saints to lay their hands on him; but if he has, the saints will soon do so. An angel spoke to Philip, not the Holy Spirit; he is not yet as honoured as others are -- it is providential. He directs him to go to a district (today it may be through one's business, or something like that) and he finds himself in a position -- in a desert -- where there is nothing for the flesh. Being in that position, the Holy Spirit owns him -- "the Spirit said to" (@Acts 8:29) him. The Holy Spirit does not even come on the saints at Samaria in connection with *his* preaching, for God deals wisely with His servants, and does not give them too much honour. He was full of the Holy Spirit in serving the saints as a deacon, but this is not said of him as a preacher.
P.L. So you have the greatest power where it is a case of bringing blessing to one man.
J.T. Yes. The Holy Spirit comes in at Samaria through the apostles from Jerusalem.
D.L.H. Was there not a special reason for that? Samaria had been in some sense a rival of Jerusalem, and God would not allow that. Jerusalem was the centre from which He was working at that time.
J.T. Yes, that is important; but the other, I am sure, is right too. Philip was not governed by any national or local feeling; he went down to Samaria and preached the Christ. The Holy Spirit does not link Himself with the work in connection with Philip till the eunuch comes by, and there is nothing very much in that, for he is, as we say, a coloured man.
P.L. Is this a little like Elisha's history at the
{566}
beginning -- laid hold of, but not definitely identified by the Spirit, typically? Elijah's mantle and power came later. You were speaking of a young brother learning to serve and the Lord standing by him.
J.T. It is well to follow that up, for the need is so great and we can never tell who has ability till they preach. You say, 'I am not asked to preach', but Philip was not asked to. As far as we know no one had asked him to preach; we can scarcely assume that the Samaritans sent for him. It is a question of what *you* will do. The Holy Spirit does not connect Himself with Philip's preaching till the eunuch comes down; then the Spirit says, "Approach and join this chariot" @Acts 8:29.
A.S.L. If any one starts out in the Lord's service, there has to be a definite work of God in his own soul. Philip goes down in his own faith; he is not backed by any society. This wonderful work was going on in Samaria, and he is told to leave it all; he seems to be a model servant in this respect, as in others also, in that he rose and went -- he was at the disposal of his Master.
J.T. Yes, and it is under the providence of God -- by an angel -- but as soon as he is down there -- at Gaza, which is desert -- the Holy Spirit says, "Join this chariot" (@Acts 8:29), and he does his work so well that the eunuch went on his way rejoicing, and Philip is caught away by the Spirit of the Lord, that is, there is an increased recognition of the man by the Spirit. Then he goes down and preaches as far as Caesarea. The point is, he is not owned specially in an official way. What is seen thus in Philip is of great importance at the present time for young men, I believe, for the need is great and the field is wide, and there is no need that anyone should invite you to preach; it is a question of what *you* are going to do.
P.L. Is not the word to Timothy on this line, "Do the work of an evangelist" @2 Timothy 4:5?
{567}
J.T. Yes.
Ques. What had you in mind in referring to a coloured man?
J.T. The need that is in the world. I do not say we should go out to Africa at all, but only to call attention to the need, and that there should be no discrimination on our part as to those whom we serve; here is a case with Philip.
F.W.J. He would welcome the support of the assembly, would he not?
J.T. Yes, Philip would have the fellowship of the brethren; that is taken account of earlier, for "Jerusalem, having heard that Samaria had received the word of God, sent to them Peter and John" @Acts 8:14. If God has brought in a principle, there is no need for it to be repeated; it stands.
F.S. Do you suggest we should not look for the support of the brethren till there is evidence of God supporting us in the work we take up?
J.T. I should not expect the brethren to put their hands on me before that. Saul is converted and he goes into the synagogue and preaches the Son of God; there you have the same idea, but he is not formally called out to work until chapter 13.
Y.Y-L. Do you think it would be happy today for young men to go out where there is no meeting and, perhaps, hire a room, and seek, under the Lord's hand, to preach there, that material might be brought in?
J.T. That is exactly what I am thinking of. You thank God for the meeting-room, but after all, there are comparatively few of them.
Y.Y-L. I had in mind the exercise that is abroad today as to more meetings, as to whether God would not bring in souls so that you have a gathering that is indigenous to the soil of the place.
J.T. Yes. The meetings are increasing; thank God! but very largely through brethren's children;
{568}
but you have in this instance new ground broken up, and broken up by persons in an unofficial way; *they* go and preach the word and the Lord is with them.
A.S.L. "God's dispensation which is in faith" (@1 Timothy 1:4); we might say, every bit of it is in faith, and no one can get on with it otherwise than in faith. As to this question of service and qualifying for ministry, there must be the stepping out in faith in dependence on the Lord.
D.L.H. Thus you will not go out depending on the brethren.
A.S.L. No, but we need to keep the thing balanced; we want to beware of the principle of freelances.
J.T. Yes. As I was saying, if God brings in a principle, it enters into all that follows; so what you get in chapters 1 and 2 necessarily enters into chapter 8. Philip would have that in mind. No doubt he would not overlook that Peter stood "up with the eleven".
F.W.J. What do you say about Saul getting his commission in chapter 9?
J.T. In chapter 9 you will remember he went and preached in the synagogue that Jesus is the Son of God, and that on his own initiative. Then we have nothing more about his service till Cornelius is brought in, and we have chapter 8 linked up with chapter 11, for the Spirit again refers to the fact that those who were scattered preached. (See verse 19.) They went down as far as Antioch, and some of them preached to the Grecians. There is not a word said in any of those cases about their having been sent or their having gift, but God was with them and persons believed through them. Then Barnabas comes down from Jerusalem to co-ordinate the work, and seeing what God is doing, he goes to seek out Saul, discerning that the work needed a special man.
F.W.J. Does an interval come in with Paul in
{569}
connection with being twelve months at Antioch (@Acts 11:26)?
J.T. He and Barnabas teach the assembly there for a whole year; then there is the prayer and fasting and they are separated by the call of the Spirit to the work to which He had called them. There is the definite call, and the saints are called upon to lay their hands on them now; they are qualified.
A.S.L. Paul had qualified in his own individual exercise and faith, had he not?
J.T. Certainly. The principles of chapters 1 and 2 are never lost sight of, but those chapters (8 and 11) show what a wide field there is for brethren to take up the work in the service of the Lord on their own initiative, and faith, in dependence on the Lord, and in due course it will come to light whether they have gift or whether they have not. If they have gift, the saints will lay their hands on them, and I believe they will be supported, financially and otherwise.
Ques. What would answer at the present day to the persecution of these early days?
A.S.L. Persecution might take the form of a deep sense in those going out of the desolation and dearth there are all around, so that, like the four lepers (@2 Kings 7) they would be compelled to go out. We need not discourage anyone, but there is great need of balance. There must be reality of faith that trusts the Lord directly, and, at the same time, dependence on the brethren. Is not the best qualifying ground often the street-corner?
Rem. Yes. Then the one at the street-corner will be pretty well tested, and the Lord will support him.
J.T. Yes. The Holy Spirit made full allowance for opportunity being given to the saints to acquire a knowledge of Saul and Barnabas, before He asked them to lay their hands on them; for I think that the Spirit saying, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul" (@Acts 13:2) means that He had an intimate knowledge of those
{570}
two men Himself. He, being here, had an intimate knowledge of the persons. But then, the saints were not so well acquainted with them, so they are with the company at Antioch a whole year before they are called upon to lay their hands on them.
D.L.H. Then Antioch became a fresh centre for the activity of the Spirit in regard to the Gentiles.
J.T. Quite, and that brings up another thing, that God's work proceeds in an unofficial way; Antioch was primarily the product of unofficial preaching. Some of those scattered ventured to preach to the Grecians, and the venture was justified. If they had been sent, the responsibility would have been on the one who sent them, but they did it of their own accord, and the result showed that God blessed it. Then Jerusalem recognised the work and sent out Barnabas, and Barnabas seeks out Saul, so they were at Antioch together for a year. Then we are told what was there; "the assembly which was there" (@Acts 13:1), and the list is given of distinguished men who were there -- the same idea as in chapter 1 -- certain distinguished persons, rich and poor, and then the Holy Spirit says, "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them" @Acts 13:2.
A.S.L. He would say that through one of the prophets, I suppose.
J.T. Yes, I should say so. Then another feature is noted -- the fasting and the prayer of the brethren. If the Holy Spirit said, Separate them, we might have assumed there was nothing more to be done but to do what He said; but the point is, the saints are called upon to do something, and they show that they are going to do it in a spiritual way. They fast and pray. Fasting would mean that these two men are not regarded as my personal friends, I am not laying my hands on them because I like them personally, nor are they my relatives; no natural feeling whatever is allowed to enter into this matter, if I fast.
{571}
Some brethren have great ability to entertain the saints, and that might enter into our appreciation of them, but if I fast, I will not take any account of that at all. I am sure the Lord would help us on those lines -- to avoid personal friendships -- personal preferences.
F.W.J. Prayer and fasting make conditions.
J.T. Yes. Sometimes we hear of certain brothers being always invited to certain localities, and certain others not invited at all to those parts. Why is that? Is it the result of fasting, or is it the result of personal preferences?
P.L. The Lord Himself is the model. He prayed before He selected the disciples.
J.T. Yes, prayed a whole night. Prayer is dependence; fasting is disallowance of natural feeling.
A.S.L. "This kind can go out by nothing but by prayer and fasting" @Mark 9:29.
Ques. Is it that prayer and fasting would keep one in line with the Spirit's movements?
J.T. I think so. After the Holy Spirit calls upon them to separate these two men, they fasted and prayed before they did it. I think the Holy Spirit would be greatly pleased with that, for their action then would be in entire accord with His selection. In searching their hearts with regard to these two men, they would go back a whole year and see what had marked each of them as amongst them. Has Saul's course been such that we can without reserve lay our hands on him? I am sure the more they thought over Saul, the more they would feel he was a worthy man; and so with Barnabas, how unjealous he was amongst them. All that would enter into the fasting.
P.L. That is a great qualification; it is the spirit of heaven, there is no jealousy there.
{572}
J.T. Yes. It would no doubt stand out in the minds of the saints at Antioch what Barnabas was when he came down as representative of Jerusalem. He might have said, 'I have come down from Jerusalem; you must listen to me', but he went and got another man.
P.L. Would the fasting prevent it being done suddenly? "Lay hands quickly on no man" @1 Timothy 5:22. There is a definite spiritual judgment arrived at by analysis.
J.T. Yes; and then another would say, 'Barnabas had lands and he sold them and laid the money at the apostles¬ feet'. That sort of thing enters into our committing ourselves to brethren.
P.L. And continuance promotes confidence.
J.T. Yes; they were with the company in Antioch the four seasons -- winter, summer, spring and autumn -- the whole year.
{573}
EPHESIANS -- THE ASSEMBLY'S LIGHT
@Ephesians 1:3 - 6; @Ephesians 1:15 - 20; @Ephesians 3:14 - 19; @Genesis 24:62 - 65
With the Lord's help I would like to dwell a little on the epistle to the Ephesians as being that which may be regarded as our light. I believe the passage in Isaiah is referred to in this epistle: "Arise, shine, for thy light is come" @Isaiah 60:1. I have been thinking of it as perhaps not altogether beyond us, although conscious of one's meagreness of apprehension, as well as the meagreness of the apprehension of the saints generally in regard to this marvellous epistle, reminding us, as it does, of the divine thoughts before the world was.
The great body of the Scriptures has to do with what transpired subsequent to the foundation of the world, with what occurred indeed since the present formation depicted in Genesis 1 and 2. But whilst the Scriptures have been engaged from that time with current occurrences, we can read certain parts as bearing on God's primary thoughts, particularly the formation of Adam and the formation of Eve. We can understand by reading these scriptures that God had His primary thoughts in mind. Thus in all the scriptures dealing with current events -- the incoming of sin and all its train -- God always had His eternal thoughts before Him, and that these must take form in due course. His righteousness, and His power, and His love have come to light in dealing with current developments, but His primary thoughts have ever been present, so that we can look back and see how glimpses of them were furnished.
In the passage I read from Genesis 24 we have Isaac standing out, as we now understand, as the heavenly man, and he is presented in this section as having just come from Beer-lahai-roi. He had *just*
{574}
*come*. I refer to this because the well, being, so far as I know, the first one introduced in Scripture, stands in relation to the assembly as the divinely provided companion for the heavenly Man. What is so striking about this well is that it came to light in connection with Hagar -- one who in no sense was to have part with Isaac. It points, I apprehend, to the provision of God available for *all*, for if there is one thing more than another which God would emphasise it is His liberality, and in giving the Spirit it is made plain that He is available generally as well as specially. There is not a person in the whole of Christendom who may not avail himself of the Spirit -- not one. He is available for all. In the giving of the Spirit it is a question of divine bounty. The giving of the Spirit at Pentecost represents heaven's *full* measure. One has to admit that one has but little conception of heaven's full measure, and that is what @Acts 2 brings out -- it was the magnitude of the gift; the Holy Spirit came personally, and as here He is available to all; hence this well is first seen in connection with Hagar. She was of the household of Abraham although an Egyptian; and, although she brought sorrow into his house, and an offspring that was "a wild-ass of a man" (@Genesis 16:12), who could never answer to the mind of God, yet this well stands in relation to her, which is, to my mind, a remarkable tribute to the magnitude of God's gift -- heaven's full measure. No one who understands that could be narrow, sectarian, or partisan. As Christ was given for all -- He gave Himself a ransom for all -- so the Holy Spirit is available for all. "To you is the promise", Peter says, "and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God may call" @Acts 2:39.
Well, Isaac is seen as just come from this well; he is in figure the heavenly man. In chapter 21 he is weaned, and Hagar and Ishmael go out, that is to
{575}
say, Abraham saw Messiah's day; he saw it by faith. We have to apprehend Christ in that way as weaned, as detached from all that is natural, to make way for our own detachment from what is natural. Hagar and Ishmael go out, but although cast out, the well was available for them. There was no *digging* of a well connected with Hagar, nor with Ishmael; the well in connection with them is entirely from the divine side, to bring out the magnitude of the divine gift, how general it is, and how available it is to all.
In chapter 22 Isaac is raised from the dead in figure, and then he is out of view so far as Scripture goes, until chapter 24, but as a type of Christ he is in the faith of Abraham. Although Abraham comes down from the mountain, there is nothing said about Isaac coming down. (See verse 19.) Abraham comes down to his young men and they go together -- a most interesting company, governed by the faith of Abraham; they go together to Beer-sheba, denoting spiritual history, and they dwell there, that is to say, you have a company in the light of the resurrection of Christ, and, I may say, of His ascension, for He went up. You have a company dwelling together at Beer-sheba -- the well of the oath -- and they are dwelling under the wing of divine faithfulness; that is the position opened up to us in the letters to Corinth. "God is *faithful*, by whom ye have been called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord" @1 Corinthians 1:9. God is *faithful* "who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able to bear" @1 Corinthians 10:13. "God is faithful, that our word to you is not yea and nay ... but yea is in him. For whatever promises of God there are, in him is the yea, and in him the amen" @2 Corinthians 1:18 - 20.
The assembly is thus seen, in figure, under the wing of divine faithfulness. But Rebekah is not there; it is not the heavenly position. It is a position of great value in the history of the believer and of
{576}
the saints, but it is not the heavenly position, for the saints at Corinth were not equal to that. What they needed was to know something about the faithfulness of God -- that God was faithful, who had called them into the fellowship of His Son. But in that position the *light* of Rebekah comes to Abraham, for you will remember that it was there the word came to him that she was born. We are thus on the threshold of the heavenly position. Sarah dies, but there is no void, for Rebekah is already on the scene, in principle, before Sarah dies.
And then we get the heavenly man, not in the patriarch Abraham, decrepit and old, though full of faith, but in Isaac, and he has just come from the well. It is the position of this dispensation; it is the position that governs it; it is Christ as the heavenly Man with the means by Him of supporting the assembly, so that it should be heavenly; he had just come from the well. He dwelt in the *south country*, that is, a position of favour, for he is the beloved, and we are taken into favour in the Beloved. The south country is a marvellous position -- a country of wells. Beer-sheba was there, Beer-lahai-roi was there. And so Isaac lifts up his eyes as he meditates at eventide -- the end of a period; his mother's tent was there, for Christ was not without His feelings in regard of Israel -- the first loved. He is meditating in the field, and he lifts up his eyes and what he sees is not Rebekah -- we are not told he saw Rebekah -- he saw the camels. For the moment it is a question of support, of power for carrying and refreshment; all these are grouped in the type so that we might understand that if Christ is the heavenly Man, the assembly is to be heavenly, not in name or theory only, but in power.
I read Ephesians because, as I said, it is our light -- not a type, but the direct word furnished for the assembly, that which is peculiarly the light governing
{577}
our position as called to heaven. So the apostle begins, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ"; then he goes on to call attention to what is in the mind of God, that "he has chosen us in him before the world's foundation, that we should be holy and blameless before him in love", having marked us out to sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, that we should be to the praise of the glory of His grace. One would love to be able by the Spirit to let the light of all that shine into one's soul -- our light -- that it might shine out, and that there might be some glimmering in these last days of the heavenly thing, of the divine mind being reflected in those who are destined for its fulfilment, even us, as the apostle says, "vessels of mercy ... prepared for glory" @Romans 9:23. Think of that -- prepared for it!
Well now, the apostle says, "Having heard of the *faith* in the Lord Jesus which is in you", that is to say, they were in the dispensation of faith, for it is the dispensation of faith. We were noticing in @Acts 1 that it was after the Lord had communicated certain things to His disciples that He was taken up from them. We must not forget that He was taken up. He had been with them for forty days as risen; that time was not exactly the faith period; it was a spiritual period; it denotes what is spiritual. They were set up in spiritual education before the faith period began -- when He was taken up. We have to understand the faith period, as it says, "faith having come" @Galatians 3:25. Faith came in in Christ, as I apprehend; He set out the great principle of faith; He is the beginner, the author, and finisher of it; He has set out the thing and finished it; the disciples could see it.
One would love to be able to open up the life of Jesus. I only just refer to it, but the disciples saw
{578}
it: "We have contemplated his glory" (@John 1:14), they said. He is never seen praying *with* them; but they see Him praying, that is to say, they see a man speaking to God on the principle of faith. One of the disciples said, "Lord, teach us to pray" (@Luke 11:1); we would like to know how to pray; and He taught them how to. In a variety of ways they could perceive what a life His was -- a marvellous life of faith set out in its perfection in the author and finisher of it. Faith was seen there; it was seen in Christ; it was seen objectively, so that they might apprehend it. While He was with them it was more sight, but before the period of faith came in, that is, when He was received out of their sight, they were taught spiritually, hence, "He presented himself living", it says, "after he had suffered" @Acts 1:3. That was to command their hearts, and to touch their hearts. "he presented himself living, after he had suffered, with many proofs" @Acts 1:3. It was not faith, it was spiritual -- that a Man should come in through closed doors, should vanish out of their sight, and then appear again. It was a marvellous education, and later He "assembled with them" (@Acts 1:4), and finally they came together asking Him a question, "Lord, is it at this time that thou restorest the kingdom to Israel? And he said to them, It is not yours to know times or seasons, which the Father has placed in his own authority; but ye will receive power, the Holy Spirit having come upon you, and ye shall be my witnesses ... And having said these things he was taken up, they beholding him, and a cloud received him out of their sight" @Acts 1:6 - 9. The faith period had begun, and the subsequent movements of the apostles and of the saints indicate how much intelligence they had, how spiritual they were. You see how they could act for God on the principle of faith. We naturally tend to what is seen -- to big meetings and the like. Thank God for big meetings, for large
{579}
numbers! May God continue to add to His people! But the principle of the faith period is not largeness in that sense, the principle is the upper room; they went to the upper room, that is to say, it is elevation in obscurity -- the heavenly thing maintained in obscurity, that is the principle.
Now, it is a difficult thing to maintain that, especially when God brings in thousands as He did, for God is great in His thoughts. The first gospel address brought in three thousand, and the numbers increased daily, we read. How then is the principle of the "little flock" (@Luke 12:32) to be preserved? I venture to say, by the keeping of the passover. It was to be kept in Egypt, for how else could the people of God get out of Egypt save in smallness and by reduction? I shall never leave Egypt by maintaining my greatness; whatever the government of God may have made me in it, I can never get out of Egypt on that principle. The only way out is by the passover, and the feast of unleavened bread. So, too, in the wilderness, and also in the land -- at the entrance to it the passover was kept.
The passover speaks of Christ's suffering: "Our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed" @1 Corinthians 5:7. The lamb was roast with fire -- direct action -- and anything that remained over until the morning was burnt. The soul is reminded in the type -- roast with fire -- of what the Lord endured on account of sin. Am I going to maintain it? The maintenance of the feast of unleavened bread is the principle of reduction. I go out of Egypt into the wilderness in smallness by the maintenance of the feast, and so, too, in the land; I believe that the maintenance of the passover contributes largely to the sustenance of the people of God in their heavenly position, for it is in smallness and in contentment in smallness, that elevation in obscurity is maintained.
Well, the Ephesians had faith, faith that could be
{580}
spoken of, and the apostle had heard of it. Faith leads us out of this world; it means that I am not looking at what is seen, but at what is unseen. "We look not at the things that are seen", says the apostle, "but at the things that are not seen; for the things that are seen are for a time, but those that are not seen eternal" @2 Corinthians 4:18. That is what faith implies. And they had, too, love to *all* the saints. The Ephesians were not national in their feelings, they were general, they had love for the saints *wherever* they were. That is a feature of the epistle to the Colossians and the epistle to the Ephesians; they embraced in their affections every member of Christ. That goes with the heavenly position, for when we are raised up, we do not go up severally, we go up *together*. We must never forget that. In the translation of the saints -- at the rapture, as we call it -- every member of Christ, from Pentecost to the end, is embraced. It is a marvellous thought, and a thought that love values, for love would not omit one of its objects. The Ephesians had love towards all the saints; so in chapter 2 the apostle says, "And has raised us up *together*" (@Ephesians 2:6); that is a tribute to their love as I understand it. He says, as it were: If you love all the saints, you will have them all with you when you go up, and when you are in heaven you will have them all. He "has made us sit down *together* in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus" @Ephesians 2:6. You know what it is, no doubt, to sit down together here, under the wing of divine faithfulness, but there, there will be no need of divine faithfulness, although there will be the evidence of it. He has made us to sit down together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus; the point in Ephesians is the greatness of the position -- in the heavenlies in Christ.
In the light of their state -- faith and love -- the apostle prays for them. I wish briefly to point out that the two prayers involve sustenance for the position.
{581}
I have spoken of the well in Genesis, but if you look through Genesis you will be greatly helped by seeing the way the Holy Spirit brings in the idea of wells, and the digging of wells. These two prayers involve the presence of the Spirit. Without the Spirit there can be no sustenance for such a position as that to which we are called.
The first great desire of the apostle was that the saints should be intelligent. The prophet Hosea speaks about the people of God being destroyed for lack of knowledge (@Hosea 4:6), and the same prophet says, "And we shall know, -- we shall follow on to know Jehovah: his going forth is assured as the morning dawn" @Hosea 6:3. It is an apprehension of Christ as He is, risen and glorified, so that the great burden of the first prayer is that the saints should be spiritually intelligent, hence he says, "that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, would give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him, being enlightened in the eyes of your heart, so that ye should know what is the hope of his calling". It is a question of state. It is the Holy Spirit in relation to the upper affections and faculties; "being enlightened in the *eyes of your heart*". The affections are involved, but the higher affections, because it is a question of heaven, and what relates to God.
It is not a question here of living water, but of the *higher* affections, and intelligence -- all that relates to God: "what is the hope of his calling". Have you ever thought, beloved, of what the hope of God's calling is? The emphasis is on *His* -- what His calling is, for it is wholly according to His mind, according to Himself. Everything that is connected with God in that way is according to Himself in the greatness of it. Then the next thing is "the riches of the glory of *his* inheritance in the saints" -- what *He* has in the saints. How differently they are
{582}
viewed in the mind as we see them in connection with the divine inheritance, what God has in them; and then, "the surpassing greatness of his power towards us who believe, according to the working of the might of his strength, in which he wrought in the Christ in raising him from among the dead". These are the things that are to be known.
How much do we know of them? that is the question. We read the Bible and books written on it (of all importance in their place), but what about the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him and that which God gives in answer to prayer? It refers to the furnishing and sustenance of the saints in the great position in which they are set. The knowledge that belongs to us infinitely surpasses what this world with all its means of education can supply; it cannot touch these things. It is a question of the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of God in these three relations.
The second prayer has reference to the *inner* man; it has in view Christ's place in our hearts. It is the Father having in view the place Christ is to have. The two things go together, so that the apostle, it seems to me, was more burdened as he drew near to this side of the truth. He says, "I bow my knees", which shows how he corresponded to the Lord, who bowed His knees in Gethsemane. The supreme exercise of the apostle for the Ephesians, for the assembly, was that they might be strengthened in the inner man. It is a question now, not so much of intelligence as of ability, power to take in things, so that he says, "being rooted and founded in love, in order that ye may be fully able to apprehend *with all saints*" (for he ever brings that in in Ephesians -- all the saints) "what is the breadth and length and depth and height; and to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge". No finite or natural mind could take in all these four dimensions. It is a question of power
{583}
from God enabling us in a spiritual way to think as He does -- to think spiritually; it is a question of ability -- that ye may be fully able to apprehend with "*all the saints*", etc. One loves to think of the place that all the saints have on this line -- the heavenly line.
And then he says, "That the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts"; it is on that principle -- through faith. It is a question of the faith period. Things are on that principle, not on the principle of sight. You love the Lord and you apprehend Him as the Christ -- as the ark of old which was brought into Zion, the city of David, as it is called, for David brings the ark in, according to the account given in 2 Samuel. It is to be noted that Joab is not brought in in the operations; it would be out of keeping with the spirit of the book; it is David's work. Joab is introduced in 2 Chronicles, but not in 2 Samuel. In the latter it is a question of David's operations in laying hold of the hearts of the people, so that there might be a place for the ark -- that Christ might be in the hearts of the saints and that He might be there to dwell -- "that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts, being rooted and founded in love, in order that ye may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height; *and to know the love of the Christ*". That is Isaac in the field, in the south country, known in the heart of Rebekah -- his love known there; he is dwelling in the heart. She lights off the camel; the camel had done its service. She says, "Who is the man that is walking in the fields to meet us?" The servant said, "That is my master". It is not Abraham now. When he set out Abraham was his master; now it is Isaac; it is Christ supreme. Rebekah took a veil and covered herself -- she is for Isaac alone. Christ dwells in the heart; He is the hidden man of the heart.
In Ephesians He dwells through faith in the hearts
{584}
of all the saints; that is the great thought, and His love is known; it surpasses knowledge, but it is known in the hearts of the saints; it is known there. And then you are "filled even to all the fulness of God", that is to say, one is merged in the divine nature, in divine love. You have touched eternity really, for there is very little between that and eternity -- "filled to all the fulness of God". There is no other way to be there intelligently save as being filled to all the fulness of God. You are there intelligently, you can apprehend everything, and you are there as filled; every vessel is to be filled to all the fulness of God.
That is what I had to say; my desire was that we might understand the calling a little, the light that is peculiarly ours, and understand also the means of sustenance there is for the great position.
{585}
THE FAITHFULNESS OF GOD REFLECTED IN HIS SERVANTS
@Matthew 24:45,46; @Hebrews 3:5; @1 Timothy 4:14; @2 Timothy 1:6
I wish to speak about the faithfulness of God, and as in all else we have to apprehend the idea as it came out in Christ. God's faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds, we are told. It is its far-reachingness that is emphasised, and so it appears from the outset that He is a faithful Creator. We have about us every day the evidences of His faithfulness in the creation, particularly the creation as it existed after the deluge, for He had entered into an engagement with it through Noah and his sons, that while the earth remained there should be seed-time and harvest, day and night, summer and winter, cold and heat. Thus everything furnishes the evidence of His bounty, for under these conditions we have rain and fruitful seasons, through which men's hearts are filled with food and gladness. While seasons may vary, as they do, the general fact remains that God has been wonderfully true to His engagement in physical things. The Christian, the godly believer, recognises this daily, as he partakes of those divine bounties for the sustenance of his body, and glorifies God in it, for these things are given, and are sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
Thus from the very outset of our histories here, we are surrounded with the evidences of the faithfulness of God, and then as the gospel comes to us, it abounds with evidences of the same thing in a spiritual way; so that we have the idea emphasised in Romans and in the letters to the Corinthians, as well as elsewhere, but particularly in the epistles that take account of Christians in their early histories.
{586}
But whether it be in an individual way, or in a collective way, we are led to understand that we can rely upon God. One has been made to feel of late, if we regard ourselves in a collective sense, how dependent we are on the faithfulness of God. As the enemy attacks in one way or another, and there are no rules by which to hold things together according to the principles of man, we are made to prove how dependent on God we are. It is a veritable miracle that men and women scattered throughout the world, without visible means of holding themselves together, are preserved, for we are preserved.
Those of us who understand something of these epistles have learned to nestle in regard of what is collective under the wing of divine faithfulness. The apostle says to the Corinthians, "God is faithful, by whom ye have been called into the fellowship of his Son" (@1 Corinthians 1:9) and again, "God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able to bear, but will with the temptation make the issue also" (@1 Corinthians 10:13), so that in the temptation what is of God in us is brought into evidence. Thus we are able to bear it; for what is of God in us is never overwhelmed. What at times might appear to engulf us melts away so that we are filled with power.
Then the apostle goes on immediately to say, "I speak as to intelligent persons" (@1 Corinthians 10:15), and then he proceeds to speak of the Lord's supper. The Lord's supper is preserved on that principle -- under the wing of divine faithfulness. In the next epistle when Paul's veracity is questioned, he says, "Now God is faithful, that our word to you is not yea and nay. For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, he who has been preached by us among you (by me and Silvanus and Timotheus), did not become yea and nay, but yea is in him. For whatever promises of God there are, in him is the yea, and in him the amen, for glory to God by us" @2 Corinthians 1:18 - 20. You see he advances in the subject as
{587}
he proceeds, for he brings the verification of every promise into a concrete form in the Son of God who was preached. One would have loved to have heard Paul preach the Son of God! He would bring out in his preaching how every divine engagement was secured and reached in the Son of God, and that it was God's doing, for the Son was here at the Father's behest, and for His pleasure, and it was of all moment to God that His engagements should be fulfilled. And so the apostle, and the other two preachers at Corinth, made it clear that the Son of God was the divine answer, the confirmation of every divine engagement. God's faithfulness was preached to the intent that the godly at Corinth should learn to nestle under that wing.
It is illustrated in Abraham in a very striking and simple way. No doubt all of you will have noticed the prominence given to Beersheba, especially in the book of Genesis. It appears in connection with an engagement by Abraham. He entered into an engagement with Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, and the requirement was that he should do no harm to the king or to his sons, or to his sons¬ sons, and Abraham accepted it and entered into a covenant according to that requirement, and the place of the covenant was called Beersheba. Beersheba means the well of the oath. Abraham dug the well there. It arose from the thought of Abraham being true to his engagement. The Philistines had evidently taken a well of water away, and Abraham had reproved the king on account of this; then he said to the king, "That thou take the seven ewe-lambs of my hand" @Genesis 21:29. He gave him more, but he gave him particularly these seven ewe-lambs, and the king naturally inquired as to the meaning of this gift. Abraham answered, "That they may be a witness to me that I have dug this well" @Genesis 21:30. These seven ewe-lambs represented the spirit in which Abraham intended to live
{588}
in relation to Abimelech, that he would never do him any harm, and that is the spirit of Christ. The Christian might well enter into this engagement, but for that we need the well -- constant refreshment -- the support of the Spirit, and so Abraham plants a grove, and calls on the name of the Lord, the everlasting God, as if he would say to God, 'You have supported me until now, and I trust in You for the future'.
Now that was Beersheba, and following it, in the next chapter, Abraham is called upon to offer up Isaac, which he does, and in figure he received Christ from the dead. And now he has not only got the promise, but the oath, the confirmation, the two immutable things in which it is impossible for God to lie. He had strong consolation, and so he descends from the mount as having received Christ from the dead. He returned to his young men, for Isaac is not now in view; it is a question of Christ risen. He has gone up and every promise is thus sure; the promise and Christ risen go together. Below there is Abraham and his young men; and these go together. The latter is a hint of assembly formation -- the experienced old brother who has counted on God, and relied on His faithfulness, and who has the confirmation of the promise of God in the oath, thus having the consummation of everything in his soul, going along together with young men. It is, as I said, a hint at assembly formation, where the old and young are together, and so they dwell at Beersheba -- they dwell there. They are dwelling under the wing of known divine faithfulness, for God is faithful. It is known to Abraham, for he had proved the faithfulness of God. And so it is apparent that the understanding of 1 and 2 Corinthians from this standpoint enables us even now, in a day of brokenness and weakness, to dwell together under the wing of divine faithfulness, for God is faithful.
{589}
One generation passes away and another comes. A *coming* generation, involving the means of the continuance of the testimony, is an evidence of the faithfulness of God.
I might go on to show how this worked out in Isaac, the heavenly man, but the time forbids it; but I will show you how it works out in Jacob, the vicissitudes of whose life aptly depict those of the history of the assembly. What you find with Jacob is that he leaves the land; Isaac never did, for he represents the heavenly man. We have ever to keep that before us if we are to be balanced in our service. But Jacob has to leave the land and take a journey; and you find he *starts from Beersheba*. When he is sent out by Isaac to find his wife among his relatives in Syria, he begins at the most southern point, at Beersheba, as if he would say, 'I have to leave the sphere of promise and to make a journey, but I begin with the faithfulness of God'. I say this for young people here. I love to see young people start in life in the light of the faithfulness of God.
Jacob began there, he virtually said, 'I know God will bring me back, that nothing He has spoken concerning me will fail'. So he began at Beersheba, and later (@Genesis 46:1) he is seen going down into Egypt with the intelligence then not of a young believer but of an old one, an experienced one. As he was going to Joseph he halted at Beersheba. He is leaving the land again, he is taking an untrodden path, as faith often has to do, and he halts at Beersheba. It was due to God that he should recognise His faithfulness, and so he offered sacrifices there to the God of his father, Isaac -- not Abraham -- as if he said, 'I know now that not one thing that Thou hast promised will fail, for all is secured in the risen Christ'. It is remarkable spiritual intelligence, and God appears to him. That is something that faith may ever look for, for faith recognises God in His
{590}
faithfulness. Jehovah appears to him and says, "I am ... the God of thy father" (@Genesis 46:3), that is, Isaac, as we might say, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ" @2 Corinthians 1:3. It is what God is in Christ. "I am ... the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for ... I will go down with thee" @Genesis 46:3,4. What a blessed experience for the pilgrim, as he started out on such a path, but he started out in the light of known divine faithfulness, and so he offered sacrifices to the God of his father.
I have dwelt on all these things that we might see what the faithfulness of God involves, and when we come to the epistle to the Romans we find what Jacob expected would come to pass, that all Israel shall be saved. God is not slack concerning His promise; faith, therefore, proves the faithfulness of God. We see it in God, and it came out in Christ, the Son of God. As Son of God He is risen. He is declared to be the Son of God. That is how the gospel presents Him. He is declared to be the Son of God with power by resurrection, and that is where verification comes in; One who could overcome every opposition, even death itself, for apparently death had denied the promises. There can be no verification except on that principle. Death had been the denial publicly of the fulfilment of the promises; the patriarchs all died in faith not having received the promises, and hence the great value of the Son of God. The power is inherent in Him to overcome every obstacle, and so the promises come to pass in a risen Christ, in One who is great enough to overcome every opposition. The Son of God, declared to be Son of God by the overthrow of the greatest stronghold of the opposition, the power of Satan in death. The believer lives under that wing, under the wing of the faithfulness of God.
I read about Moses because he is presented to us as faithful in all God's house, and I wish to connect
{591}
Moses with the passages read in Timothy before I go to Matthew. I do that because of prophetic indications made at his birth. Prophecy brings in the mind of God before the thing comes to pass. I dwell on this for a moment, so that the young may understand the connection in which ministry is set. The delicate seed sown long before should mature, and develop, and correspond with the mind of God delivered by prophecy. I speak thus, so that we may not think lightly of divine service. Every servant is watched over not only from his birth, but long before; such is God's interest in the vessels that He uses in His ministry, and so, as Moses was born there was something for the parents to see, not much, no doubt, but long before God had foreseen Moses, so in the beginning of Exodus we have the record of the marriage of his parents. His sister was born before him, Aaron was born before him, but no reference is made to them. A son is born, and that son, according to the New Testament, was "exceedingly lovely" @Acts 7:20. "By faith Moses, being born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw the child beautiful" @Hebrews 11:23. There was a prophetic indication of what was in that child, what was there was potential. There may not have been much, but enough for the parents; and so it is, beloved, in regard of those who minister.
I particularly confine my remarks to those who minister. The apostle says to Timothy, "Be not negligent of the gift that is in thee, which has been given to thee through prophecy, with imposition of the hands of the elderhood". These are two things -- gift by prophecy, and the hands of the elderhood. Prophecy is the mind of God about Timothy; to whom it was indicated it is not said, but that it was indicated there is no doubt, and that the apostle Paul had an idea, a divinely given impression, of it when he took up Timothy as a young man, there can be no doubt.
{592}
In Acts 16:3 we read, "Him [Timothy] would Paul have go forth with him" @Acts 16:3. The apostle sorely needed such a companion. He had lost Barnabas, and the Lord gave him Timothy. He found Timothy and there was prophetic indication of gift. The brethren look for these things, for these prophetic indications of gift. Something will come to light to indicate what is there potentially. It may be clouded later, as it was with Moses, for there was no evidence of it in the house of Pharaoh.
The life of Moses was divided into three parts, but what was potentially in that babe was indicated at the beginning. There was no evidence of it while he was in Pharaoh's court, but when he became forty years of age and went out to see his brethren, he knew something about it himself then. And every brother should know it as a secret between himself and God. What he did on his own initiative was the outcome of his links and relations with God. His brethren did not understand, and they forced him away. We have to endure that, brethren, we have to learn how to serve unsympathetic people, and it is a wholesome exercise. The prophecy had gone before, but now Moses knew it himself; he was conscious of his interest in his brethren, and of his power to help, but the elderhood, so to speak, was not ready. The prophecy indicated what Moses was, but Moses personally was not yet equal to the prophecy concerning him. That requires the formation of the vessel and takes time, and that is where we lack. We all do. We expect the elderhood to lay their hands on us too soon, but the elderhood will not do that. The true elderhood lay their hands on persons who are formed, and you cannot deceive them, for with them it is a question of experience; they know something of Christ, the Vessel that suits God, so they are not too ready to lay their hands upon you; you have to qualify.
{593}
In Timothy's case he had gift and they laid their hands upon him.
Now I proceed to the next epistle, and here Paul says, "I put thee in mind to rekindle the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of *my* hands". This is an advance, as you might expect; remember, if we are not advancing we are retrograding. If you have passed the elderhood, you may expect Paul's hands, that is to say, you are qualified now for something special. The elderhood is a general idea, prophecy is a general idea, it is the mind of God about the vessel, but now there is something special. I do not know of anyone else spoken of in this way. Timothy had received gift through the laying on of Paul's hands. When there was a general drift away from Paul, there was a special man there to stand up firmly for his ministry. If we lose it, I may say, we lose all, for Paul's ministry is the heavenly thing. What the assembly is to Christ, as the heavenly Man must never be surrendered, and hence the apostle urges on Timothy to rekindle the gift of God which was in him.
And this leads me to Matthew; I need not remind you of the importance of special service, for it is the idea of special service in that gospel. "Who then is a faithful and prudent bondman?" He is singled out. It is not, Who are these? It is one person in view. It is not that that person accredits anything to himself -- far otherwise but the Lord inquires, 'Who is he?' "Who then is the faithful and prudent bondman?" In Mark's gospel the Lord says, "There are some of those standing here that shall not taste death until they shall have seen the kingdom of God come in power" @Mark 9:1. There were six days to prepare, and certainly if I value seeing the kingdom of God coming in power, I shall not be unprepared, I shall not fail in anything to fit me for it, and so here the challenge is, "Who then is the faithful and prudent bondman?"
{594}
It is for each one to answer. The Lord intends to create in us a desire to be that. It is not that there is not room for many; there is room for any number of faithful and wise bondmen, but the Lord puts it in the singular. Am *I* to be that?
You will notice that "faithful" is put first. It is said of Moses that he was faithful in all God's house, and that marked him to the end. The book of Deuteronomy is the greatest tribute to the spiritual continuance of Moses. It is in that book that the Holy Spirit eulogises him. There was no evidence of decline or weakness. He would not go over what he said forty years back in the same words. He was in such spiritual vigour and freshness that he presented things in a living way; he was able to present the same things in a new garb. He kept no stock of sermons. He spoke in Deuteronomy in the power of the Spirit -- in freshness; his speech distilled as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb. He was fresher than ever; his natural force was not abated, and his eye was not dim. They were "the words which Moses spoke" (@Deuteronomy 1:1) when he was over a hundred and nineteen years old, and in chapter after chapter he pours out his own thoughts for the people, so much so that at the end it says, "These are the words of the covenant that Jehovah commanded Moses ... besides the covenant that he made with them in Horeb" @Deuteronomy 29:1. There is more sap, more power in Deuteronomy than in any of the books, because there it is a matter of his own feelings and affections, as inspired by the Spirit of God. He is the man Moses. When he was about to die he was able to witness to the love of God to the people; he said, "Yea, he loveth the peoples" @Deuteronomy 33:3. There is nothing old or stale or mouldy about Deuteronomy. If the book witnesses to anything, it is to the faithfulness of Moses, preparing the people for God and for God's land, and so he is faithful in all God's house to the end, and the book finishes
{595}
with a tribute to him, for it says, "And there arose no prophet since in Israel like Moses" @Deuteronomy 34:10. It is the production of an old man in point of years, but of a young man spiritually, retaining his youth, and freshness, and feelings, and keeping before the people the mind of God.
Now who is that faithful and wise bondman whom the Lord can set over His household, to give them food, the portion of meat in due season, for that is where the faithfulness lies? There is room for many; am I to be one? Blessed is that servant whom his Lord when He cometh shall find so doing -- one whose hand is not slack, one who has not given up the ministry, but keeps going on. "Blessed is that bondman ... he will set him over all his substance". What an incentive to be faithful! "He that is faithful in the least is faithful also in much" @Luke 16:10. May God bless His word.
