A. W. ROACH, 8.8.8.8.8.8.
|1|
Eternal King of those who reign,
To Thee be honour, might, Amen.
Thou, God from all eternity,
Alone hast immortality.
Thy dwelling light, Thy form unknown,
Supreme art Thou, O God, alone!
|2|
In form of God wast Thou, O Lord,
By universal hosts adored;
Co-equal Thou in Deity,
The Father of eternity.
But now as Man Thou dost display
What men may know, Their eye survey.
|3|
Thou, Lord, to endless years "The Same,"
The Son, the excellent in Name,
Thou hast Thy place upon the throne,
High majesty, the Heir alone.
Thy government shall still increase;
Redeemer, Saviour, Price of Peace!
{2}
J. G. DECK (1807-1884) Adapted, 8.7.8.7.4.7.
|1|
Father, ¬twas Thy love that knew us
Earth's foundation long before;
That same love to Jesus drew us
By its sweet constraining power,
And hath made us
Sons before Thee evermore.
|2|
Now that changeless love enfolds us,
All its wealth on us bestows;
While its power unchanging holds us
In a holy calm repose.
God and Father,
Unto Thee our worship flows.
{3}
J G DECK, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Thou wast the image, Lord, in lowly guise,
Of the Invisible to mortal eyes;
Son of His bosom, come from heav'n above,
We see in Thee incarnate, "God is love."
|2|
Thy lips the Father's Name to us reveal;
What burning power in all Thy words we feel,
As with enraptured hearts we hear Thee tell
The heav'nly glories which Thou know'st so well!
{4}
MISS A. M. HARDING, 11.10.11.10. DACTYLIC
|1|
Thine is the love, Lord, that draws us together,
Guiding our steps from the wilderness ways;
Soon face to face we'll adore Thee for ever,
Now our glad hearts would be filled with Thy praise.
|2|
Faithful Thy grace o'er our pathway has waited,
Deep the delight we have found, Lord, in Thee;
Now with this treasure our spirits are freighted,
Bowed at Thy feet, and the fragrance set free.
|3|
For us, Lord Jesus, thyself Thou hast given;
Suff'rings unfathomed for us hast thou known;
Now, in accord with the homage of heaven,
Rises a song from the hearts of Thine own.
|4|
Jesus, Lord Jesus, we love and adore Thee;
Glorious Thy Name, all our praises above;
Peerless Thy beauty, we worship before Thee,
Hushed are our spirits, at rest in Thy love.
{5}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Lord, in Thee we taste the sweetness
Of the Tree of Life above;
Taste its own eternal meetness
For the heav'nly land we love.
|2|
In eternal counsels purposed,
Food of heav'nly life to be;
Fresh and ever new are yielded
Fruits of life on that blest Tree.
|3|
Varied fruits of richest flavour
Offers still the Tree divine;
One itself, the same for ever,
Every precious fruit is Thine;
|4|
Fruits that now our souls have tasted
By the Spirit from above,
While through desert lands we've hasted;
Fruits of perfect, endless love.
{6}
MISS M. BOWLY (1813-1856), C.M.
|1|
Jesus! How much Thy Name unfolds
To every opened ear!
The pardoned sinner's memory holds
None other half so dear.
|2|
That Name encircles every grace
That God as Man could show;
There only could He fully trace
A life divine below.
|3|
Jesus -- it speaks a life of love,
Of sorrows meekly borne;
It tells of sympathy above,
Whatever makes us mourn.
|4|
Jesus, the One who knew no sin,
Made sin to make us just;
Thou gav'st Thyself our love to win,
Our full confiding trust.
|5|
The mention of Thy Name shall bow
Our hearts to worship Thee;
The chiefest of ten thousand Thou,
Whose love has set us free.
{7}
H BONAR, C.M.
|1|
All that we were -- our sins, our guilt,
Our death -- was all our own;
All that we are we owe to Thee,
Thou God of grace, alone.
|2|
Thy mercy found us in our sins,
And gave us to believe;
Then, in believing, peace we found;
And in Thy Christ we live.
|3|
All that we are, as saints on earth,
All that we hope to be
When Jesus comes and glory dawns,
We owe it all to Thee.
{8}
MARY BOWLY, 6.6.6.5.6.6.6.5.
|1|
O Lord, we adore Thee,
For Thou art the slain One,
That livest for ever,
Enthroned in heav'n.
O Lord, we adore Thee,
For Thou has redeemed us;
Thy love's wondrous story
We read in Thy blood.
|2|
O God, we acknowledge 
Thy greatness, Thy glory;
For of Thee are all things
On earth and in heav'n.
How rich is Thy mercy,
How great Thy salvation!
We bless Thee, we praise Thee!
Amen, and Amen.
{9}
S P TREGELLES, 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
Father, we Thy children bless Thee
For Thy love on us bestowed;
Source of blessing, we confess Thee
Now our Father and our God.
Wondrous was Thy love in giving
Jesus for our sins to die;
Wondrous was His grace in leaving,
For our sakes, the heav'ns on high.
|2|
Now the sprinkled blood has freed us;
Hast'ning onward to our rest,
Through the desert Thou dost lead us,
With Thy constant favour blest;
By Thy truth and Spirit guiding --
Earnest He of bliss to come --
And with daily strength providing,
Thou dost lead Thy children home.
|3|
Though we oft are found in sorrow,
This is not our resting place;
Joy awaits us on the morrow,
When we see the Bridegroom's face.
And, that day anticipating,
In this hope our souls rejoice;
Soon will end our time of waiting,
Soon we'll hear His welcome voice.
{10}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), 6.5.11.6.5.11.
|1|
For ever with Thee, Lord,
And like Thee to be,
For ever with Thee, at Thy coming again;
We'll live in Thy grace, Lord,
We'll gaze on Thy face,
When finished our race, at Thy coming again.
|2|
The traits of that face, Lord,
Once marred through Thy grace,
Our joy'll be to trace at Thy coming again;
With Thee evermore, Lord,
Our hearts will adore,
Our sorrow be o'er at Thy coming again.
|3|
We'll sit on Thy throne, Lord,
Confessed as Thine own,
Of all to be known at Thy coming again.
But glory on high, Lord,
Is not like being nigh,
When all is gone by, at Thy coming again.
{11}
J. CONDER (1789-1855) Adapted, 8.6.8.6.8.8.
|1|
Thou art the blest incarnate Word,
The Father's only Son,
God manifest, God seen and heard,
The heav'n's beloved One;
The Lamb of God, exalted Lord,
Worthy art Thou to be adored!
|2|
In Thee most perfectly expressed
The Father's self doth shine:
Thou of full Deity possessed,
Eternally divine.
With Thee before the Father's face,
We celebrate His boundless grace.
|3|
Image of th¬ Infinite Unseen,
Whose Being none can know;
Brightness of light no eye hath seen,
God's love revealed below;
The light of love has shone in Thee,
And in that love our souls are free.
|4|
The higher myst'ries of Thy fame
The creature's grasp transcend;
The Father only (glorious claim!)
The Son can comprehend.
The sweetness of that name of love
The Father gives us now to prove.
|5|
Yet loving Thee, on whom His love
Ineffable doth rest,
Our hearts are led to Him above,
And we with Thee are blest.
The Father's Name Thou hast declared,
The Father's love with Thee is shared.
|6|
Of the vast universe of bliss
The centre Thou and Sun;
Th¬ eternal theme of praise is this,
That God's beloved Son
Fills all that scene, where God alone
In His own rest is fully known.
{12}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), S.M.
|1|
Sing without ceasing, sing
The Saviour's present grace,
How all things shine in light divine
For those who've seen His face.
|2|
He's gone within the veil,
For us that place has won;
In Him we stand, a heav'nly band,
Where He Himself is gone.
|3|
There all's unsullied light,
Our hearts let in its rays;
And heav'nly light makes all things bright,
Seen in that blissful gaze.
|4|
Such here on earth we are,
Though we in weakness roam;
Our place on high, God's self so nigh,
His presence is our home.
|5|
And stayed by joy divine,
As hireling fills his day,
Through scenes of strife and desert life
We tread in peace our way.
|6|
That way is upward still,
Where life and glory are;
Our rest's above, in perfect love
The glory we shall share.
|7|
For ever with the Lord,
For ever like Him then,
We'll see His face in that blest place,
Our Father's house in heav'n.
{13}
MRS G HELYAR (1849-1913), L.M.
|1|
O Lord and Saviour, we recline
On that eternal love of Thine;
Thou art our rest, and Thou alone
Remainest when all else is gone.
|2|
Yes! "Thou remainest": sea and land,
E'en heav'n shall pass, but Thou shalt stand;
Undimmed Thy radiancy appears,
Changeless through all the changing years.
|3|
Lord on the Throne Thy love's the same
As once upon Thy cross of shame;
In lowliness Thou cam'st to die,
Thou livest now for us on high.
|4|
We see Thee there, the Lamb once slain;
Thy loss was our eternal gain;
We see Thee crowned with glory now,
No shade on Thy victorious brow.
|5|
The shadow dwelt on Calv'ry's tree,
And now Thine unveiled face we see;
Praise be to God for that blest word,
That "Thou remainest," blessed Lord!
{14}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Hark! ten thousand voices crying
"Lamb of God!" with one accord;
Thousand thousand saints replying
Wake at once the echoing chord.
|2|
Praise the Lamb! -- the chorus waking,
All in heav'n together throng;
Loud and far, each tongue partaking,
Rolls around the endless song.
|3|
Grateful incense this, ascending
Ever to the Father's throne;
Every knee to Jesus bending,
All the mind in heav'n is one.
|4|
All the Father's counsels claiming
Equal honours to the Son;
All the Son's effulgence beaming
Makes the Father's glory known.
|5|
By the Spirit all pervading,
Hosts unnumbered round the Lamb,
Crowned with light and joy unfading,
Hail Him as the great "I AM".
|6|
Joyful now the wide creation
Rests in undisturbed repose,
Blest in Jesu's full salvation,
Sorrow now nor thraldom knows.
|7|
Hark! still louder swells the singing,
As the notes are heard again;
Through creation's vault is ringing
Joy's response, Amen! Amen!
{15}
E. WILLIAMS, 8.5.8.5.
|1|
Lord, we do not ask the question,
Where abidest Thou?
Well we know where Thou art dwelling,
Well we know it now.
|2|
Thou abidest in the bosom
Of the Father's love;
In that love for ever living --
Love, all thought above.
|3|
And we know that Thou wouldst have us
Ever dwell with Thee:
In that holy, heav'nly circle,
Home of liberty.
|4|
Lord, we thank Thee, this our portion
While we wait for Thee:
Now to live in love unbounded,
And eternally.
|5|
Hold our hearts, O Lord, we pray Thee,
By and in Thy love,
Till we dwell with Thee in glory
Evermore above.
{16}
J. NEWTON (1725-1807), 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
May the grace of Christ our Saviour,
And the Father's boundless love,
With the Holy Spirit's favour,
Rest upon us from above.
Thus may we abide in union
With each other and the Lord,
And possess, in sweet communion,
Joys which earth can ne'er afford.
{17}
J. N. DARBY, 7.6.7.6.
|1|
Jesus, Thou King of glory,
We soon shall dwell with Thee,
And sing Thy love's bright story,
When we Thy glory see.
|2|
E'en now our souls would enter
Thy presence, Lord, on high,
That all our love might centre
In Thee who cam'st to die.
|3|
At God's right hand in glory
Thou art, Thy work complete,
Till perfected the story
That gives us too our seat.
|4|
Then o'er the wide creation
Thy power will stretch its arm -
Secure from all temptation,
Free from all human harm.
{18}
MARIE DE FLEURY (D 1794), 11.11.11.11.
|1|
Lord Jesus, we worship and bow at Thy feet,
And give Thee the glory, the honour that's meet;
While through Thee, O Saviour, our praises ascend
And swell the loud chorus that never shall end.
{19}
MISS M NUNN (1778-1847), 8.4.8.4.8.8.8.4.
|1|
One there is above all others --
O how He loves!
His is love beyond a brother's --
O how He loves!
Earthly friends may fail or leave us,
One day soothe, the next day grieve us,
But this Friend will ne'er deceive us --
O how He loves!
|2|
Joy and peace it is to know Him --
O how He loves!
Think, O think how much we owe Him --
O how He loves!
With His precious blood He bought us,
In the wilderness He sought us,
To His loved ones safely brought us --
O how He loves!
|3|
We have found a friend in Jesus --
O how He loves!
¬Tis His great delight to bless us --
O how He loves!
How our hearts delight to hear Him
Bid us dwell in safety near Him --
Why should we distrust or fear Him?
O how He loves!
|4|
Through His Name we are forgiven --
O how He loves!
Backward shall our foes be driven --
O how He loves!
Best of blessings He'll provide us,
Nought but good shall e'er betide us,
Safe to glory He will guide us --
O how He loves!
{20}
W. COWPER (1731-1800), C.M.
|1|
God moves in a mysterious way
His wonders to perform;
He plants His footsteps in the sea,
And rides upon the storm.
|2|
Deep in unfathomable mines
Of never-failing skill,
He treasures up His bright designs,
And works His sovereign will.
|3|
Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take,
The clouds ye so much dread
Are big with mercy, and shall break
In blessings on your head.
|4|
Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
But trust Him for His grace:
Behind a frowning providence
He hides a smiling face.
|5|
His purposes will ripen fast,
Unfolding every hour;
The bud may have a bitter taste,
But sweet will be the flower.
|6|
Blind unbelief is sure to err,
And scan His work in vain;
God is His own interpreter,
And he will make it plain.
{21}
MISS H K BURLINGHAM, 6.5.11.6.5.11.
|1|
We're waiting for Thee, Lord,
Thy beauty to see;
We're waiting for Thee, for Thy coming again.
Thou'rt gone over there, Lord,
A place to prepare;
Thy home we shall share at Thy coming again.
|2|
¬Mid danger and fear, Lord,
We're oft weary here;
The day must be near of Thy coming again.
¬Tis all sunshine there, Lord,
No sighing nor care,
But glory so fair at Thy coming again.
|3|
Whilst Thou art away, Lord,
We stumble and stray,
O hasten the day of Thy coming again!
This is not our rest, Lord;
As pilgrims confessed
We wait to be blest at Thy coming again.
|4|
E'en now let our ways, Lord,
Be bright with Thy praise,
For brief are the days ere Thy coming again.
We're waiting for Thee, Lord,
Thy beauty to see;
No triumph can be like Thy coming again.
{22}
G. V. WIGRAM (1805-1879), 11.10.11.10. DACTYLIC
|1|
How bright, there above, is the mercy of God!
And void of all guilt, and clear of all sin,
Are my conscience and heart, through my Saviour's blood:
Not a cloud above -- not a spot within.
|2|
Christ died! then I'm clean: not a spot within.
God's mercy and love! not a cloud above.
¬Tis the Spirit, through faith, thus triumphs o'er sin:
Not a cloud above -- not a spot within.
{23}
J. HART (1712-1768), 8.8.8.8.
|1|
How good is the God we adore,
Our faithful unchangeable Friend,
Whose love is as great as His power,
And knows neither measure nor end.
|2|
¬Tis Jesus, the First and the Last,
Whose Spirit shall guide us safe home;
We'll praise Him for all that is past,
And trust Him for all that's to come.
{24}
S. W. GANDY (d. 1851), S.M.
|1|
His be the Victor's name,
Who fought the fight alone;
Triumphant saints no honour claim,
His conquest was their own.
|2|
Through weakness and defeat
He won the meed and crown;
Trod all our foes beneath His feet,
In being trodden down.
|3|
He Satan's power laid low;
Made sin, sin's reign o'erthrew;
Bowed to the grave, destroyed it so,
And death by dying slew.
|4|
Bless, bless the Conqueror slain,
Slain in His victory;
Who lived, who died, who lives again
In glorious majesty.
{25}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), C.M.
|1|
Father, Thy name our souls would bless,
As children taught by grace,
Lift up our hearts in righteousness
And joy before Thy face.
|2|
Sweet is the confidence Thou giv'st,
Though high above our praise;
Our hearts resort to where Thou liv'st
In heav'n's unclouded rays.
|3|
Absent as yet, we rest in hope,
Treading the desert path,
Waiting for Him who takes us up
Beyond the power of death.
|4|
O Holy Father, keep us here
In that blest Name of love,
Walking before Thee without fear,
Till all be joy above.
{26}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), C.M.
|1|
Father, thy love our portion is,
As sons, like Christ, with Thee;
O who can tell of love like this,
So sovereign, full and free?
|2|
His Father Thou, and ours through grace,
We taste the same delight;
Blest in the brightness of Thy face,
In heav'n's unclouded light.
|3|
Unchanging glory fills the place
Where Jesus dwells on high,
But brighter joy our spirits trace
With Him, for ever nigh!
|4|
There in the purpose of Thy love
Our place is now prepared,
As sons with Him who is above,
Who all our sorrows shared.
|5|
Eternal ages shall declare
The riches of Thy grace,
To those who with Thy Son shall share
A son's eternal place.
|6|
We joy in Thee, Thy holy love
Our endless portion is --
Like Thine own Son, with Him above,
In brightest heav'nly bliss.
{27}
MRS J. A. TRENCH, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
All the path the saints are treading,
Trodden by the Son of God;
All the sorrows they are feeling,
Felt by Him upon the road:
|2|
He is able thus to succour
Those who tread the desert sand,
Pressing on to resurrection,
Where He sits at God's right hand.
|3|
Whether joy, or whether trial,
All can only work for good,
For He holdeth all -- who loves us,
And hath bought us with His blood.
|4|
Taken up in resurrection,
Desert ways rehearsed above
Tell the power of God's salvation,
And His never-failing love.
{28}
J. BAKEWELL (1721-1819), 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
Hail! Thou once despised Jesus;
Praises loudly now we sing;
Thou didst suffer, Lord, to save us,
Nigh to God Thine own to bring.
Hail! once lowly Man of sorrows,
Bearer of our grief and shame;
Graced in Thee by God's own favour,
Life we have in Thy blest Name.
|2|
Jesus, hail! enthroned in glory,
There in majesty divine,
There in heav'n our hearts accord Thee
Every honour that is Thine;
There for us in patience waiting,
With Thy loved ones all to share:
We that joy anticipating
Till in glory we appear.
|3|
Soon we shall, as come to glory,
Thy transcendent grace relate,
Gladly sing th¬ amazing story
Of Thy dying love so great.
In that blessed contemplation
We for evermore shall dwell,
Praise with deepest adoration
Love that none below can tell.
{29}
A. G. SPANGENBERG, IRREGULAR
|1|
We adore Thee evermore, Hallelujah!
Saviour, for Thy boundless grace: Hallelujah!
For the cross, whereby to us, Hallelujah!
Sure is made eternal bliss: Hallelujah!
|2|
For Thy death which set us free, Hallelujah!
From sin's cruel slavery: Hallelujah!
For Thine all-atoning blood, Hallelujah!
Which hath bought us nigh to God : Hallelujah!
{30}
ADAPTED, 8.8.6.8.8.6.
|1|
O mystery of Love divine!
Where righteousness and peace combine,
And truth and mercy meet.
God manifest in flesh behold,
In Jesus see that love unfold,
The work of grace complete.
|2|
Love, only love, Thy heart inclined,
And brought Thee, Saviour of mankind,
Down from the throne above;
Love made Thee here a Man of grief,
Distressed Thee sore for our relief --
O mystery of love!
|3|
Love's glorious triumph now we see,
For Thou wilt have Thine own with Thee,
Where grief can never come;
Where every heart is filled with joy,
And praise shall every tongue employ,
In love's eternal home.
|4|
Love there will crown what love began,
Its wondrous ways of grace to man,
In its fair home above.
All, all, O Lord, will there proclaim
Through endless years Thy blessed Name,
Supreme, almighty Love!
{31}
MRS J. A. TRENCH, 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
Centre of the Father's counsels,
He for whom all things were made;
Object of the Father's pleasure,
Who the Father's name displayed;
All the Father's will accomplished,
Unto death the path He trod;
Now in highest glory seated,
Centre of the throne of God.
|2|
Called to share the Father's pleasure
In His well-beloved Son,
(Seated on His throne in heaven
For the work on earth well done,)
We adore Him, and are waiting
To behold Him face to face --
In His presence praise the glory,
Learn the riches of His grace.
{32}
S. P. TREGELLES (ADAPTED), 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Son of God! With joy we praise Thee,
On the Father's throne above;
All Thy wondrous work displays Thee,
Full of grace and full of love.
|2|
Lord, accept our adoration;
Thou for us in death hast lain;
Through Thy blood we have redemption,
Soon shall share Thy glorious reign.
|3|
Streams of bounty richly flowing,
Bearing blessings from above,
Life and holy joy bestowing,
Tell of God's unwearied love.
|4|
God, in Thee that love unfolding,
Shows how vast, how rich His grace;
Blest our lot, with joy beholding
All His glory in Thy face.
{33}
T KELLY (ADAPTED), 6.6.6.6.8.8.
|1|
Th¬ atoning work is done,
The Victim's blood is shed;
And Jesus now is gone
His people's cause to plead.
He lives in heav'n their great High Priest,
And bears their names upon His breast.
|2|
No temple made with hands
His place of service is;
In heav'n itself He stands,
A heav'nly priesthood His.
Now pass away the shadows dim,
The very image shines in Him.
|3|
And though awhile He be
Hid from the eyes of men,
His people look to see
Their great High Priest again.
In brightest glory He will come,
And take His waiting people home.
{34}
W. P. MACKAY, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
The Lord is ris'n; The Red Sea's judgment flood
Is passed, in Him who bought us with His blood.
The Lord is ris'n; we stand beyond the doom
Of all our sin, through Jesu's empty tomb.
|2|
The Lord is ris'n; with Him we also rose,
And in His grave see vanquished all our foes.
The Lord is ris'n; beyond the judgment land,
In Him, in resurrection life we stand.
|3|
The Lord is ris'n; the Lord is gone before,
We long to dwell with Him for evermore.
The Lord is ris'n; our triumph-shout shall be,
"Thou hast prevailed! Thy people, Lord, are free!"
{35}
E. RUBIE, C.M.
|1|
O God of love, how measureless
Thy thoughts to us are shown!
More precious they than tongue can tell,
Their fulness none have known.
|2|
We can but bless Thee for the light
In which Thou art revealed,
The favour of Thy countenance
To those Thy love has sealed.
|3|
Our hearts are more than filled with joy;
Our cup indeed runs o'er;
And, Father, in Thy presence now
We worship and adore.
|4|
We boast in Thee, Thou source of good,
Thy glory fills our sight;
Now reconciled through Jesu's death,
We praise with great delight.
{36}
J. MONTGOMERY (1771-1854), 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
Hail to the Lord's Anointed,
Great David's greater Son!
When to the time appointed
The rolling years shall run,
He comes to break oppression,
To set the captive free;
To take away transgression,
And rule in equity.
|2|
The heav'ns, which now conceal Him
In counsels deep and wise,
In glory shall reveal Him
To our rejoicing eyes;
He, who with hands uplifted
Went from the earth below,
Shall come again all gifted
His blessing to bestow.
|3|
He shall come down like showers
Upon the new-mown grass,
And joy and hope, like flowers,
Spring up where He doth pass;
Before Him on the mountains
Shall peace, the herald, go;
And righteousness, in fountains,
From hill to valley flow.
|4|
Kings shall fall down before Him
And gold and incense bring;
All nations shall adore Him,
His praise all people sing.
Outstretched His wide dominion
O'er river, sea and shore,
Far as the eagle's pinion
Or dove's light wing can soar.
{37}
MRS MACKAY (1802-1887), L.M.
|1|
Asleep through Jesus, blessed sleep,
From which none ever wake to weep;
A calm and undisturbed repose,
Where powerless is the last of foes.
|2|
Asleep through Jesus: O how sweet
To be for such a slumber meet!
With holy confidence to sing
That death has lost its venom sting.
|3|
Asleep through Jesus, peaceful rest,
Whence waking we're supremely blest;
No fear, no woe shall dim that hour
That manifests the Saviour's power.
|4|
Asleep through Jesus: yes! to be
From every earthly hindrance free,
While, in the consciousness of love,
The spirit lives with Christ above.
{38}
MISS H K BURLINGHAM, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
O Jesus, Friend unfailing,
How dear art Thou to me!
Are cares or fears assailing?
I find my strength in Thee.
Why should my feet grow weary
Of this my pilgrim way?
Rough though the path and dreary,
It ends in perfect day.
|2|
Nought, nought I count as pleasure,
Compared, O Lord, with Thee;
Thy sorrow, without measure,
Earned peace and joy for me.
I love to own, Lord Jesus,
Thy claims o'er me divine;
Bought with Thy blood most precious,
Whose can I be but Thine.
|3|
O worldly pomp and glory,
Your charms are spread in vain!
I've heard a sweeter story,
I've found a truer gain.
Where Christ a place prepareth,
There is my loved abode;
There shall I gaze on Jesus:
There shall I dwell with God.
|4|
For every tribulation,
For every sore distress,
In Christ I've full salvation,
Sure help and quiet rest.
No fear of foes prevailing!
I triumph, Lord, in Thee:
O Jesus, Friend unfailing,
How dear art Thou to me!
{39}
E L BEVIR (1847-1922), 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Our God and Father, may our souls repose
In the deep sense of Thine unfailing love!
Kept by Thy peace, in Him who died and rose,
Till we are gathered to Thy rest above.
{40}
MISS C. A. WELLESLEY, 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
O Thou great all-gracious Shepherd,
Shedding for us Thy life's blood,
Unto shame and death delivered,
All to bring us nigh to God!
Now our willing hearts adore Thee,
Now we taste Thy dying love,
While by faith we come before Thee,
Faith which lifts our souls above.
|2|
Past Thy sorrow, Lord, we hail Thee
Crowned with glory on the throne;
Meet it is Thy saints should bless Thee
For the place Thy death hath won;
Won for us, that in full measure
We should have our part with Thee,
Taste the river of Thy pleasure,
Share in all Thy victory.
{41}
UNKNOWN, L.M.D.
|1|
Father, our thanks to Thee we owe;
What rich unfathomable grace
On us in Christ dost Thou bestow!
Children of wrath (our nature's place),
Redeemed an now with Him made one,
Glories around unbounded shine;
The fulness of our God alone
The measure is of grace divine.
{42}
P. ELLIS, 8.5.8.5.8.5.8.5.
|1|
Lord, together Thee recalling,
Turn we now to praise;
Thankful hearts, Thy Name adoring,
Sweetest song can raise.
Thou hast loved us, Thou hast bought us,
Thou hast made us free;
Hearts and voices blended, singing,
Glory unto Thee.
|2|
Thine the cost and Thine the suff'ring,
Thine the cross and shame;
Ours the never-ending blessing
Through Thy precious Name.
Thine it is, Lord, now the travail
Of Thy soul to see;
Thus o'erflowing with Thy praises,
Sing we now to Thee.
{43}
J KENT (1766-1843), S.M.
|1|
What cheering words are these!
Their sweetness who can tell!
In time and to eternal days --
¬Tis with believers well!
|2|
In every state secure,
Watched by the Saviour's eye
¬Tis well with them should life endure,
And well if called to die;
|3|
Well in affliction's ways,
Or on the mount with God;
Well when they joy, and sing, and praise,
Or buffet with the flood.
|4|
¬Tis well when joys arise,
¬Tis well when sorrows flow,
Or darkness seems to veil the skies,
And strong temptations grow.
|5|
¬Tis well when on the mount
They feast and joy in love;
And ¬tis as well, in God's account,
When they the furnace prove.
|6|
But, above all, how well
When Jesus speaks the word,
And, at the trumpet's sounding swell,
They rise to meet their Lord!
{44}
I. WATTS, S.M.
|1|
Ye saints, repeat His praise
Whose mercies are so great;
Whose anger is so slow to rise,
So ready to abate.
|2|
High as the heav'ns are raised
Above the earth we tread,
So far the riches of God's grace
Our highest thoughts exceed.
|3|
His grace subdues our sin;
And His forgiving love,
Far as the east is from the west,
Did all our guilt remove.
|4|
Man's life is as the grass,
Or like the morning flower;
If one sharp blast sweep o'er the field,
It withers in an hour.
|5|
But Thy compassions, Lord,
To endless years endure;
And all Thy people ever find
Thy word of promise sure.
{45}
N. L. ZINZENDORF (1739), L.M.
|1|
Jesus, the Lord, our righteousness!
Our beauty Thou, our glorious dress!
Before the throne, in this arrayed,
With joy shall we lift up the head.
|2|
Bold shall we stand in that great day,
For who aught to our charge shall lay,
While by Thy blood absolved we are
From sin and guilt, from shame and fear?
|3|
Thus Abraham, the friend of God,
Thus all the saints redeemed with blood,
Saviour of sinners Thee proclaim,
And all their boast is in Thy Name.
|4|
This spotless robe the same appears
In new creation's endless years;
No age can change its glorious hue,
The robe of Christ is ever new.
|5|
Till we behold Thee on Thy throne
In Thee we boast, in Thee alone:
Our beauty Thou, our glorious dress,
Jesus, the Lord, our righteousness!
{46}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), 7.7.8.7.7.7.8.7.
|1|
Maker of earth and heaven,
Whose arm upholds creation,
To Thee, O God, we voice our praise
And bend in adoration.
We praise the power that made us,
We praise the love that blesses;
While every day that rolls away
Thy gracious care confesses.
|2|
Though trials and affliction
May cast their shadows o'er us,
Thy love doth throw a heav'nly glow
Of light on all before us;
That love has smiled from heaven
To cheer our path of sadness,
And lead the way thro¬ earth's dark day
To realms of joy and gladness.
|3|
The light of love and glory
Has shone through Christ our Saviour,
The Crucified, who lived and died
That we might live for ever.
And since Thy great compassion
Thus brings Thy children near Thee,
May we to praise devote our days,
And keep for ever near Thee.


{47}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), C.M. 
|1|
Blest Lord, Thou spakest! ¬twas Thy voice
That led our hearts to Thee;
That drew us to that better choice,
Where grace has set us free.
|2|
Thou wouldest that we should rejoice,
And walk by faith below;
Enough, that we have heard Thy voice,
And learned Thy love's deep woe --
|3|
Thy glory, Lord: this living waste
To us no rest can give;
Our path is on with earnest haste,
Lord, in Thy rest to live.
|4|
Our happiness, O Lord, with Thee
Is long laid up in store,
For that blest day when Thee we'll see,
And conflict will be o'er.
|5|
Yes, love divine in Thee we know;
The Father's glories soon
Shall burst upon our ravished view,
Thyself our joy and crown.
|6|
Soon shall we see Thee as Thou art,
O hope for ever blest!
Thou'lt call us, in our heav'nly part,
The Father's house, to rest.
|7|
O rest ineffable, divine,
the rest of God above,
Where we shall ever see Thee shine,
Our joy, eternal love!
{48}
P. DODDRIDGE, S.M.
|1|
Grace taught our wand'ring feet
To tread the heav'nly road;
And new supplies each hour we meet
While trav'lling home to God.
|2|
In grace God wrote each name
In his eternal book;
In grace He gave the spotless Lamb,
Who all our burdens took.
|3|
Grace saved us from the foe,
Grace taught us how to pray;
And God will ne'er His grace forgo,
Till we have won the day.
|4|
May grace, free grace, inspire
Our souls with strength divine;
May every thought to God aspire,
And grace in service shine.
|5|
Grace all the work shall crown
Through everlasting days;
It lays in heav'n the topmost stone:
To God be all the praise!
{49}
J G DECK, C.M.
|1|
High in the Father's house above
Our mansion is prepared;
There is the home, the rest we love,
With Christ for ever shared.
|2|
With Him we love, in spotless white,
In glory we shall shine;
His blissful presence our delight,
In love and joy divine.
|3|
All taint of sin shall be removed,
All evil done away,
And we shall dwell with God's Beloved
Through God's eternal day.
{50}
J N DARBY, 6.4.6.4.
|1|
O Lord, ¬tis sweet the thought
That Thou art mine;
But brighter still the joy
That I am Thine!
|2|
Thine own, O Lord, the fruit,
The cherished fruit
Of Thine all-perfect love!

No passing root
|3|

Of evil e'er will dim
Thy cloudless rays;
But a full heart pour forth
Thine endless praise!
|4|
O joy supreme and full,
Where sunless day
Sheds forth, with light divine,
Its cloudless ray!
{51}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), 7.6.7.6.
|1|
O Lord, Thy love's unbounded,
So sweet, so full, so free;
My soul is all transported
Whene'er I think on Thee!
|2|
Yet, Lord, alas! what weakness
Within myself I find;
No infant's changing pleasure
Is like my wand'ring mind.
|3|
And yet Thy love's unchanging,
And doth recall my heart
To joy in all its brightness,
The peace its beams impart.
|4|
Yet sure, if in Thy presence
My soul still constant were,
Mine eye would, more familiar,
Its brighter glories bear.
|5|
And thus Thy deep perfections
Much better should I know,
And with adoring fervour
In this Thy nature grow.
|6|
Still sweet ¬tis to discover,
If clouds have dimmed my sight,
When passed, eternal Lover,
Towards me, as e'er, Thou'rt bright.
|7|
O keep my soul, then, Jesus,
Abiding still with Thee,
And, if I wander, teach me
Soon back to Thee to flee;
|8|
That all Thy gracious favour
May to my soul be known;
And, versed in this Thy goodness,
My hopes Thyself shalt crown.
{52}
J. G. DECK (1807-1884), L.M.
|1|
Lord, we are Thine, bought by Thy blood,
Once the poor guilty slaves of sin;
But Thou redeemedst us to God,
And mad'st Thy Spirit dwell within.
|2|
Lord, we are Thine, Thy claims we own;
Ourselves to Thee we'd wholly give;
Reign Thou within our hearts alone,
And let us to Thy glory live!
|3|
Here let us each Thy mind display,
In all Thy gracious image shine;
And haste that long expected day
When Thou shalt own that we are Thine.
{53}
T H REYNOLDS (1830-1930), C.M.
|1|
Blest God and Father, in Thy sight
We bow and own Thy grace;
We worship in Thy glorious light,
Which shines in Jesu's face.
|2|
He fills Thy presence; fully known
His worth alone to Thee;
But in our hearts Thy light hath shone,
In love that sets us free.
|3|
The glories of His work we bring,
Thee glorified we see;
His deep perfections gladly sing,
And tell them forth to Thee.
|4|
With great delight His Name we praise,
Blest Father, in Thine ear,
And songs of joy and triumph raise,
As now to Thee brought near.
{54}
J. NEWTON (1725-1807), C.M.
|1|
How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
In a believer's ear!
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,
And drives away His fear.
|2|
It makes the wounded spirit whole,
It calms the troubled breast;
¬Tis manna to the hungry soul,
And to the weary rest.
|3|
Blest Name! the rock on which we build,
Our shield and hiding place;
Our never-failing treasury, filled
With boundless stores of grace.
|4|
Jesus! our Saviour, Shepherd, Friend,
Thou Prophet, Priest, and King,
Our Lord, our Life, our Way, our End,
Accept the praise we bring.
|5|
Weak is the effort of our heart,
And cold our warmest thought;
But when we see Thee as Thou art,
We'll praise Thee as we ought.
|6|
Till then we would Thy love proclaim
With every fleeting breath;
And triumph in Thy blessed Name
Which quells the power of death.
{55}
P. GERHARDT (1607-1676) from German, S.M.
|1|
Through waves, through clouds and storms,
God gently clears the way;
We wait His time; so shall the night
Soon end in blissful day.
|2|
He everywhere hath sway,
And all things serve His might;
His every act pure blessing is,
His path unsullied light.
|3|
When He makes bare His arm,
Who shall His work withstand?
When He His people's cause defends,
Who then shall stay His hand?
|4|
We leave it to Himself
To choose and to command;
With wonder filled, we soon shall see
How wise, how strong His hand!
|5|
We comprehend Him not,
Yet earth and heaven tell,
God sits as sovereign on the throne,
And ruleth all things well.
{56}
MISS M. BOWLY (1813-1856), 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
O Lord, how blest our journey,
Though here on earth we roam,
Who find in Abba's favour
Our spirits¬ present home:
For where Thou now art sitting
By faith we've found repose,
Free to look up to heaven,
Since our blest Head arose.
|2|
In spirit there already,
Soon we ourselves shall be
In soul and body perfect,
All glorified, with Thee.
Thy Father's love sustains us
Along the thorny way;
Thy Father's house, the dwelling
Made ready for that day.
|3|
The Comforter, now present,
Assures us of Thy love;
He is the blessed Earnest
Of glory there above;
The river of Thy pleasure
Is what sustains us now,
Till Thy new Name's imprinted
On every sinless brow.
|4|
Lord, we await Thy glory;
We have no home but there,
Where all Thine own together
Thy joy with Thee shall share.
No place can fully please us
Where Thou, O Lord, art not;
In Thee, and with Thee, ever
Is found, by grace, our lot.
{57}

E. L. BEVIR, C.M.
|1|
Where glory lights the courts on high,
With highest glory crowned,
Thee, Lord of power and majesty,
Celestial hosts surround.
|2|
O who shall sing that path of worth,
That led up to the throne?
The Corn of Wheat upon this earth
Could but abide alone;
|3|
But Thou art risen from the dead,
And we, as one with Thee,
Now sing Thy Name, our Lord, our Head,
A heav'nly company.
|4|
Blest Saviour, Thou art waiting yet
Till, perfect at Thy side,
Thy blest companion shall be set,
Thy fair and spotless bride.
{58}
UNKNOWN, C.M.
|1|
Lord, who can pay the mighty debt
Of love so rich as Thine?
Love, which surpasseth finding out,
Unspeakable, divine!
|2|
O rather give us, daily, more --
More every hour -- to see
That such a bounteous giver Thou,
We must Thy debtors be.
{59}
T H REYNOLDS (1830-1930), L.M.
|1|
O God, Thou dost engage our hearts
With Christ, Thy well-beloved Son;
Thy love a holy joy imparts,
A joy which He for us hath won.
|2|
With hearts thus filled we enter now
Thy presence, where, most blessed God,
Thy glory rests upon His brow,
Who brought us nigh to Thee by blood.
|3|
To Him Thy voice from out the cloud
Once spake Thy deep, Thy full delight;
And now, without a veil to shroud,
In Him shines forth Thy glory bright.
|4|
'This Jesus fills that holy place
Where glory dwells, and Thy deep love
In its own fulness (known through grace)
Rests where He lives, in heav'n above.
|5|
Yet midst Thine own the Spirit still
Bears witness of His glory there,
And from the sphere which He doth fill
Brings knowledge of His fulness here.
|6|
Our God we bless Thee, Father Thou
Of Him, Thy well-beloved Son;
As blest in Him before Thee bow,
And joy in all that love has done.
{60}
E. RUBIE, 6.6.6.5.6.6.6.5.
|1|
O Lord, we adore Thee,
Blest Son of the Father,
Whose love without measure
Surpasses all praise!
Thyself Thou hast given,
We know Thee now -- risen,
Ascended -- in heaven,
Where on Thee we gaze.
|2|
Our Father, we praise Thee,
Thou source of all blessing;
The Son has revealed Thee
In fulness of light.
We joy in Thy presence,
We worship before Thee,
In love and, all blameless,
In holiness bright.
{61}
E. L. BEVIR, 8.8.8.8.8.8.
|1|
O Lord of glory, who couldst leave
The height supreme in death to lie,
What tongue shall sing, what heart conceive
The love divine that made Thee die?
Bought with a price, for ever Thine,
We bless Thee for Thy stoop divine.
|2|
But ris'n, the Firstborn from the dead,
Triumphant hast Thou entered in;
The glorious Man, the living Head,
Thrice worthy Thou our hearts to win!
In Thy blest face all glories shine,
And there we gaze on love divine.
{62}
H. ALIEN, C.M.
|1|
Father, Thine own unbounded love
Has reached us through Thy Son;

We now are one with Him above;
Eternity's begun.
|2|
As thus before Thee without blame,
In Him who lives we live;
Our spirits rise to bless Thy Name,
And holy worship give.
|3|
The praises led by Thy Beloved
Delight Thy holy ear;
And we, with hearts divinely moved,
Rejoice that praise to share.
|4|
Father, Thy love our portion is;
Thou gav'st us to Thy Son,
For Thine own glory and for His,
Made like that blessed One.
|5|
In that bright scene of cloudless light,
Where sons at home shall be,
With Him we'll share that glory bright
And all His beauty see.
{63}
S P TREGELLES (1813-1875), 7.7.8.7.
|1|
Thy Name we bless, Lord Jesus,
That Name all names excelling;
How great Thy love, all praise above,
Should every tongue be telling!
|2|
We sing aloud Thy praises,
Our hearts and voices blending;
¬Tis Thou alone we worthy own;
Thy beauty's all transcending!
{64}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), S.M.
|1|
O bright and blessed scenes,
Where sin can never come;
Whose sight our longing spirit weans
From earth, where yet we roam.
|2|
And can we call our home
Our Father's house on high,
The rest of God our rest to come
Our place of liberty?
|3|
Yes! in that light unstained
Our stainless souls shall live;
Our hearts¬ deep longings more than gained
When God His rest shall give.
|4|
His presence there, my soul
Its rest, its joy untold
Shall find, when endless ages roll,
And time shall ne'er grow old.
|5|
Our God the centre is,
His presence fills that land,
And countless myriads, owned as His,
Round Him adoring stand.
|6|
Our God whom we have known,
Well known in Jesu's love,
Rests in the blessing of His own
Before Himself above.
|7|
Glory supreme is there,
Glory that shines through all;
More precious still that love to share
As those that love did call.
|8|
Like Jesus in that place
Of light and love supreme,
Once Man of sorrows, full of grace,
Heav'n's blest and endless theme.
|9|
Like Him! O grace supreme!
Like Him before Thy face;
Like Him to know that glory beam
Unhindered face to face! 
|10|
O love supreme and bright,
Good to the feeblest heart,
That gives us now as heav'nly light
What soon shall be our part!
{65}
B G HARDINGHAM (1894-1973), 10.4.10.4.10.10.
|1|
Father, to Thee a joyful song we raise
With all Thine own,
And in Thy presence sound a note of praise
To Thee alone;
Brought nigh, brought home to Thee -- O wondrous grace,
That gives us now, with Thine own Son our place.
|2|
How deep the holy joy that fills that scene
Where love is known!
Thy love, our God and Father, now is seen
In Him alone;
As, in the holy calm of Thine own rest,
He leads the praise of those Thy love has blest.
|3|
He leads the praise, how precious to Thine ear
The song He sings!
How precious, too, to Thee how near how dear --
Are those He brings
To share His place: ¬twas thus that Thou did'st plan;
Thou lovedst Him before the world began.
{66}
MISS C. THOMPSON (1822-1909), 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
O gracious God, Thy pleasure
Is in Thy Christ made known,
And tells the boundless measure
Of blessing for Thine own.
He has Thy presence entered,
As Man in heav'n is known;
In Him Thy glory's centred,
In Him Thy purpose shown.
|2|
And O what love is beaming
Refulgent in that face!
What blessed light is streaming
From that most glorious place!
Both love and light proclaiming
What Thou, the Father, art,
And wondrous grace revealing,
With Thine own Son, our part.
|3|
Thou source of every blessing!
Thou spring of all delight!
Thy Name with joy confessing
Let all the saints unite!
Each heart its praise outpouring
To Thee all praise above,
Each voice in strains adoring
Re-echoes -- "God is love."
{67}
A. CARRUTHERS, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
We bless Thee, God and Father,
We joy before Thy face;
Beyond dark death for ever,

We share Thy Son's blest place.
He lives a Man before Thee
In cloudless light above,
In Thine unbounded favour,
Thine everlasting love.
|2|
His Father and our Father,
His God and ours Thou art;
And He is Thy beloved,

The gladness of Thy heart.

We're His, in joy He brings us
To share His part and place,
To know Thy love and favour,
The shining of Thy face.
|3|
Thy love that now enfolds us
Can ne'er wax cold or dim;
In Him that love doth centre,
And we are loved in Him.
In Him Thy love and glory
Find their eternal rest;
The many sons -- His brethren --
In Him, how near, how blest!
{68}
I. WATTS, C.M.
|1|
My God, the spring of all my joys,
The life of my delights;
The glory of my brightest days,
The comfort of my nights.

|2|
The opened heav'ns upon me shine
With beams of sacred bliss;
Jesus proclaims that He is mine,
And whispers I am His.
|3|
My soul would leave this cumbrous clay
At that transporting word;
Await with joy that coming day
When I shall see my Lord.
{69}

G. W. FRASER (1840-1896), S.M.
|1|
O blessed living Lord,
Engage our hearts with Thee,
And strike within the answ'ring chord
To love so rich and free.
|2|
To know Thy loving heart,
And cleave to Thy blest side;
To gaze upon Thee where Thou art,
And in Thy love abide;
|3|
To walk with Thee below,
And learn Thy holy ways;
Each day more to Thy stature grow,
To Thine eternal praise --
|4|
Be this our whole desire --
Thyself our object here:
The goal to which our hearts aspire,
To meet Thee in the air.
{70}
MRS A R COUSIN, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.5.
|1|
The sands of time are sinking,
The dawn of heaven breaks;
The summer morn I've sighed for,
The fair sweet morn awakes.
Dark, dark hath been the midnight,
But dayspring is at hand,
And Christ in glory dwelleth
In the heav'nly land.
|2|
O Christ, He is the fountain,
The deep sweet well of love:
The streams on earth I've tasted,
More deep I'll drink above.
There to an ocean fullness
His mercy doth expand,

Where He in glory dwelleth
In the heav'nly land.
|3|
With mercy and with judgement
My web of time He wove,
And aye the dews of sorrow
Were lustred with His love.
I'll bless the hand that guided,
I'll bless the heart that planned,
Where Christ in glory dwelleth
In the heav'nly land.
|4|
O I am my Beloved's,
And my Beloved's mine!
He brings me ¬neath love's banner,
Into His "house of wine."
I stand upon His merit,
I know no other stand,
Not e'en where glory dwelleth
In the heav'nly land.
{71}
D. A. THRUPP, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Father, we commend our spirits
To Thy love, in Jesu's name;
Love which His atoning merits
Give us confidence to claim.
|2|
O how sweet, how real a pleasure
Flows from love so full and free!
'Tis a vast exhaustless treasure,
Saviour, We possess in Thee.
|3|
By the Holy Ghost anointed,
May we do the Father's will,
Walk the path by Him appointed,
All His pleasure to fulfil.
{72}
P. GERHARDT, 7.6.7.6.
|1|
Our God is our salvation,
Our refuge in distress;

What earthly tribulation
Can shake our steadfast peace?
|2|
The ground of our profession
Is Jesus and His blood;
He gives us the possession
Of everlasting good.
|3|
We know no condemnation,
No law that speaks despair;
And Satan's accusation,
With Christ, we need not fear.
|4|

For us there is provided 
A city fair and new;
To it we shall be guided;
Jerusalem's in view.
|5|
Our portion there is lying,
A destined heav'nly lot;
And though we're daily dying,
Our portion fadeth not.
|6|
The heart within us leapeth,
And cannot down be cast,
Since with our God it keepeth
Its never-ending feast.
|7|
The Sun whose shining lights us
Is Jesus Christ alone;
And what to song incites us
Is heav'n on earth begun!
{73}
J. G. DECK, 7.6.7.6.
|1|
The day of glory, bearing
Its brightness far and near,
The day of Christ's appearing,
We now no longer fear.
|2|
He once, a spotless Victim,
For us on Calv'ry bled;
Jehovah did afflict Him,
And bruised Him in our stead.
|3|
To Him by grace united,
We joy in Him alone;
And now by faith, delighted,
Behold Him on the throne.
|4|
And O His grace transcending
Its fulness will declare,
When, from on high descending,
He meets us in the air!
|5|
Then let Him come in glory,
Who comes His saints to raise,
To perfect all the story
Of wonder, love, and praise!
{74}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), S.M.
|1|
Rest of the saints above,
Jerusalem of God!
Who, in thy palaces of love,
Thy golden streets have trod
|2|
To us thy joy to tell?
Those courts secure from ill,
Where God Himself vouchsafes to dwell,
And every bosom fill.
|3|
Who shall to us that joy
Of saint-thronged courts declare;
Tell of that constant sweet employ
Our spirits long to share?
|4|
That rest, secure from ill,
No cloud of grief e'er stains;
Unfailing praise each heart doth fill,
And love eternal reigns.
|5|
There only to adore,
Our souls their strength shall find;
Their life, their joy for evermore,
By sight, nor sense, defined.
|6|
God and the Lamb shall there
The light and temple be,
And radiant hosts for ever share
The unveiled mystery!
|7|
And see! the Spirit's power
Has ope'd the heav'nly door,
Has brought us to that favoured hour
When toil shall all be o'er.
{75}
W. LAWRENCE, 10.4.10.4.10.10.

|1|
Jesus, our Lord, thy worthiness we sing,
Thy peerless fame.
Our sacrifice of praise to Thee we bring,
And bless Thy Name.
Thy glories fill our vision with delight,
And heart and voice to honour Thee unite.
|2|
Yet wider praise in Zion waits for Thee,
Her Lord and King;
Creation too, in rest and liberty,
Shall tribute bring;
Both heav'n and earth shall Thy dominion own,
And every tongue confess Thee Lord alone.
|3|
More blessed still -- Thine own peculiar joy
Thy saints shall be,
Who then shall find their constant blest employ
In praising Thee;
And with Thee, Lord, Thy glory shall behold,
While love delights its wonders to unfold.
{76}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Rise, my soul, thy God directs thee,
Stranger hands no more impede;
Pass thou on, His hand protects thee --
Strength that has the captive freed.
|2|
Is the wilderness before thee,
Desert lands where drought abides?
Heav'nly springs shall there restore thee,
Fresh from God's exhaustless tides.
|3|
Light divine surrounds thy going,
God Himself shall mark thy way;
Secret blessings, richly flowing,
Lead to everlasting day.
|4|
God, thine everlasting portion,
Feeds thee with the mighty's meat;
Price of Egypt's hard extortion,
Egypt's food no more to eat.
|5|
Art thou weaned from Egypt's pleasures?
God in secret thee shall keep,
There unfold His hidden treasures,
There His love's exhaustless deep.
|6|
In the desert God will teach thee
What the God that thou hast found --
Patient, gracious, powerful, holy;
All His grace shall there abound.
|7|
On to Canaan's rest still wending,
E'en thy wants and woes shall bring
Suited grace from high descending;
Thou shalt taste of mercy's spring.
|8|
Though thy way be long and dreary,
Eagle strength He'll still renew;
Garments fresh and foot unweary
Tell how God hath brought thee through.
|9|
When to Canaan's long-loved dwelling
Love divine thy foot shall bring,
There with shouts of triumph swelling,
Zion's songs in rest to sing;
|10|
There no stranger-God shall meet thee --
Stranger thou in courts above! --
He, who to His rest shall greet thee,
Greets thee with a well known love.
{77}
J. MONTGOMERY, S.M.
|1|
The Lord Himself shall come,
And shout a quick'ning word;
Thousands shall answer from the tomb,
"For ever with the Lord!"
|2|
Then with Him ever nigh,
"Like Him", O blessed word!
This then our shout of victory,
"For ever with the Lord!"
{78}
G. GILPIN, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
O God of grace, our Father,
All praise we give to Thee;
¬Tis in Thy sovereign favour
All blessedness we see;
There only is the fountain
Whence living waters flow,
Which like a glorious river
Still gladden as they go.
|2|
As Thine Thou didst foreknow us
From all eternity;
Thy chosen, loved ones, ever
Kept present to Thine eye;
And when was come the moment,
Thou, calling by Thy grace,
Didst gently, firmly draw us
Each from his hiding-place.
|3|
Thy word, Thyself reflecting,
Doth sanctify by truth,
Still leading on Thy children
With gentle, heav'nly growth.
Thus still the work proceedeth
(The work begun by grace)
In each, made meet, yet training,
To dwell before Thy face.
{79}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), S.M.
|1|
God and the Lamb -- ¬tis well
I know that source divine
Of joy and love no tongue can tell,
Yet know that all is mine.
|2|
The Lamb is there, my soul,
Where God Himself doth rest
In love divine diffused through all,
With Him supremely blest.
|3|
There on the hidden bread
Of Christ, once humbled here --
God's treasured store -- for ever fed,
His love my soul shall cheer.
|4|
Called by that secret name
Of undisclosed delight
(Blest answer to reproach and shame),
Graved on the stone of white.
|5|
There in effulgence bright,
Saviour and Guide, with Thee
I'll walk, and in Thy heav'nly light

Whiter my robe shall be.
|6|
There, in th¬ unsullied way
Which His own hand hath dressed,
My feet press on, where brightest day
Shines forth on all the Rest.
|7|
But who that glorious blaze
Of living light shall tell,
Where all His brightness God displays,
And the Lamb's glories dwell?
{80}
J. SWAIN (1761-1796), 6.6.6.6.8.8.
|1|
On earth the song begins,
In heav'n more sweet and loud:
To Him who cleansed our sins
By His atoning blood,
To Him, we sing in joyful strain,
Be honour, power and praise, Amen.
|2|
Alone He bore the cross,
Alone its grief sustained;
His was the shame and loss,
And He the vict'ry gained;
The mighty work was all His own,
Tho¬ we shall share His glorious throne.
{81}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), C.M.
|1|
O Lord, Thy glory we behold,
Though not with mortal eyes;
That glory on the Father's throne
No human sight descries.
|2|
¬Tis thence -- now Christ is gone on high,
Redemption's work complete --
The Spirit brings His glory nigh
To those who for Him wait.
|3|
And we our great Forerunner see
In His own glory there;
Yet not ashamed with such as we,
As Firstborn, all to share.
|4|
The Father's love, the source of all,
Sweeter than all it gives,
Shines on us now without recall,
And lasts while Jesus lives.
|5|
The new creation's stainless joy
Gleams through the present gloom;
That world of bliss without alloy,
The saints¬ eternal home.
{82}
MRS. J. A. TRENCH, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Jesus, Thou alone art worthy
Ceaseless praises to receive:
For Thy love, and grace, and goodness
Rise o'er all our thoughts conceive.
|2|
With adoring hearts we render
Honour to Thy precious Name;
Overflowing with Thy mercies,
Far and wide Thy worth proclaim.
|3|
Praise Him! Praise Him! Praise the Saviour,
Saints, aloud your voices raise.
Praise Him! Praise Him! Till in heaven
Perfected we'll sing His praise.
{83}
H. P. WELLS, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
O the wondrous joy of dwelling,
Father, in Thy house above!
Every feature Christ reflecting,
And our God's surpassing love.
|2|	
Thoughts divine conceived in purpose,
There fulfilled for His delight;
All that shone in Christ, once humbled,
There expands in glory's light.
|3|
Object blessed of God the Father,
Christ in all and all shall be;
Every thought of Him unfolding
Wakes fresh bursts of ecstasy.
|4|
Every circle gathered round Him
Yields of Christ some beauteous ray;
And for God's delight and pleasure
Shines throughout th¬ eternal day.
|5|
There the Father's love transcendent
Shall for ever find its rest;
While each heart, with joy o'erflowing,
In that love is ever blest.
{84}
T. WILLEY, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Lord Jesus, gladly do our lips express
Our hearts¬ deep sense of all Thy worthiness;
Thou risen One, the Holy and the True,
We give Thee now the praise so justly due.
|2|
Thou giv'st us, Lord, once more to taste down here
The joy Thy presence brings, its warmth and cheer;
With great delight we ¬neath Thy shadow rest;
Thy fruit is sweet to those Thy love has blest.
|3|
Thou wast alone, till like the precious grain
In death Thou layest but didst rise again;
And in Thy risen life a countless host
Are "All of one" with Thee, Thy joy and boast.
|4|
We bless Thee, Lord, Thou lov'st to take Thy place
Amongst Thine own, who taste Thy boundless grace;
¬Tis here we learn Thee as Thou'rt known above
In heav'nly glory -- home of perfect love.
{85}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), 8.8.11.8.
|1|
There is rest in the tender love
That has trodden our path below;

That has found us a place in the realms above,
But can now all our sorrows know.
|2|
There is rest in the midst of grief --
For His grief was the proof of love;
O ¬tis sweet in that love now to find relief,
When the sorrows of earth we prove.
|3|
There is rest in the blessed yoke,
And in proving no will but His,
While we learn from His path, and the words He spoke,
What that patience of Jesus is!
|4|
So where Jesus has gone before
Is the path which we have to tread;
And it leads to the rest where all sorrow's o'er --
To the place where His steps have led.
{86}
MISS M. BOWLY (1813-1856), 8.4.8.4.8.8.8.4.
|1|
Through the love of God our Saviour,
All will be well;
Free and changeless is His favour,
All, all is well.
Mighty is the power that healed us,
Precious is the grace that sealed us,
Strong the hand stretched forth to shield us:
All must be well.
|2|
Though we pass through tribulation,
All will be well;
Ours is such a full salvation,
All, all is well.
Happy still in God confiding;
Fruitful, if in Christ abiding;
Steadfast, through the Spirit's guiding:
All must be well.
|3|
We expect a bright tomorrow;
All will be well.
Faith can sing through days of sorrow,
All, all is well.
On our Father's love relying,
Jesus every need supplying,
Or in living, or in dying,
All must be well.
{87}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), L.M.
|1|
Father, Thy sovereign love has sought
Captives to sin, gone far from Thee;
The work that Thine own Son hath wrought
Has brought us back in peace and free.
|2|
And now, as sons before Thy face,
With joyful steps the path we tread,
Which leads us on to that blest place
Prepared for us by Christ our Head.
|3|
Thou gav'st us, in eternal love,
To Him to bring us home to Thee,
Suited to Thine own thoughts above,
As sons like Him, with Him to be
|4|
In Thine own house. There love divine
Fills the bright courts with cloudless joy;
But 'tis the love that made us Thine
Fills all that house without alloy.
|5|
O boundless grace! What fills with joy
Unmingled all that enter there,
God's nature, love without alloy,
Our hearts are giv'n e'en now to share.
|6|
God's righteousness with glory bright,
Which with its radiance fills that sphere --
E'en Christ of God the power and light --
Our title is that light to share.
|7|
O Mind divine, so must it be
That glory all belongs to God!
O Love divine, that did decree
We should be part, through Jesu's blood.
|8|
O keep us, Love divine, near Thee,
That we our nothingness may know,
And ever to Thy glory be
Walking in faith while here below.
{88}
J. STENNETT (1663-1713) Adapted, C.M.
|1|
O blessed Saviour, is Thy love
So great, so full, so free?
Fain would we have our souls, our hearts,
Our minds engaged with Thee.
|2|
We love Thee for the glorious worth
Which in Thyself we see;
We love Thee for that shameful cross,
Endured so patiently.
|3|
No greater love can man display
Than for His friends to die;
Thus faithful to Thine own wast Thou:
What love with Thine can vie?
|4|
Though in the very form of God,
With heav'nly glory crowned,
Thou didst a servant's form assume,
Beset with sorrow round.
|5|
Thou like Thy brethren wouldst become,
And here a suff'rer be;
Of flesh and blood Thou didst partake,
Through death to set us free.
|6|
As man, O Lord, it was not good
That Thou alone shouldst be;
Fruit of Thy death, Thou hast secured
Companions meet for Thee.
|7|
O Lord, we treasure in our souls
The memory of Thy love;
And ever shall Thy Name to us
A grateful odour prove.
{89}
G. V. WIGRAM (1805-1879), S.M.
|1|
O what a debt we owe
To Him who shed His blood,
And cleansed our souls, and gave us power
To stand before His God!
|2|
Saviour and Lord, we own
The riches of Thy grace;
For we can call Thy God, our God,
Can bow before His face.
|3|
Thy Father, too, above,
We worship as our own,
Who gave with Thee the Spirit's cry
To us, His sons foreknown.
{90}
SIR. E. DENNY, 7.7.8.7.7.7.8.7.
|1|
Break forth and sing His praises!
Dwell on His wondrous story;
The Saviour's name and love proclaim --
The Lord of life and glory.
There on the throne of heaven,
O'er all His foes victorious;
The Crucified, who for us died,
Now crowned for ever glorious.
|2|
Thy heart was pressed with sorrow,
The bonds of death to sever;
To make us free, that we might be
Thy crown of joy for ever.
Hail to Thee, Lord of glory,
Head of the wide creation!
Thy ways of grace we love to trace,
And praise Thy great salvation.
{91}
THEODULPH (DIED 821), IRREGULAR
|1|
Glory, honour, praise and power,
Be unto the Lamb for ever!
Jesus Christ is our Redeemer!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Hallelujah! Praise we the Lord!
{92}
G. V. WIGRAM (1805-1879), S.M.
|1|
What raised the wondrous thought,
Or who did it suggest,
That we, the church, to glory brought,
Should with the Son be blest?
|2|
O God, the thought was Thine,
Thine only could it be,
Fruit of the wisdom, love divine,
Peculiar unto Thee.
|3|
For, sure, no other mind,
For thoughts so bold, so free,
Greatness or strength could ever find;
Thine only could it be.
|4|
The motives, too, Thine own,
The plan, the counsel, Thine;
Made for Thy Son, bone of His bone,
In glory bright to shine.
|5|
O God, with great delight
Thy wondrous thought we see;
Upon His throne, in glory bright,

The bride of Christ shall be.
|6|
Sealed with the Holy Ghost,
We triumph in that love;
Thy wondrous thought has made our boast,
Glory with Christ above!
{93}
E. DENNY (1796-1889), C.M.
|1|
Light of the lonely pilgrim's heart,
Star of the coming day,
Arise, and with Thy morning beams
Chase all our griefs away!
|2|
Come, blessed Lord! bid every shore
And answering island sing
The praises of Thy royal name,
And own Thee as their King.
|3|
Bid the whole earth, responsive now
To the bright world above,
Break forth in rapturous strains of joy
In memory of Thy love.
|4|
O Lord, Thy fair creation groans,
The air, the earth, the sea,
In unison with all our hearts,
And calls aloud for Thee.
|5|
Thine was the cross, with all its fruits
Of grace and peace divine;
Be Thine the crown of glory now,
The palm of vict'ry Thine!
{94}
I WATTS, S.M.
|1|
Break forth and sing the song
Of "Glory to the Lamb!"
Wake every heart and every tongue,
To praise the Saviour's name.
|2|
Sing of His dying love;
Sing of His rising power;
Sing how He intercedes above
For those whose sin He bore.
|3|
Sing on your heav'nly road,
Ye sons of glory, sing;
To the exalted Lamb of God
Your cheerful praises bring.
|4|
Soon shall we hear Him say,
"Ye ransomed pilgrims, come"
Soon will He call us hence away,
And take us to His home.
|5|
Then shall each raptured tongue
His fullest praise proclaim;
And sweeter voices wake the song
Of "Glory to the Lamb!"
{95}
S. MEDLEY (1738-1799), L.M.
|1|
Awake, each saint, in joyful lays,
To sing the great Redeemer's praise;
He justly claims a song from thee:
His loving kindness, O how free!
|2|
He saw us ruined in the fall,
Yet loved us notwithstanding all;
He saved us from our lost estate:
His loving kindness, O how great!
|3|
Though numerous hosts of mighty foes,
Though earth and hell our way oppose,
He safely leads His saints along:
His loving kindness, O how strong!
|4|
When trouble, like a gloomy cloud,
Has gathered thick and thundered loud.
He by His church has always stood:
His loving kindness, O how good!
|5|
Soon He will call us hence away
To the bright realms of endless day;
There shall we with Himself above
His loving kindness ever prove.
{96}
J G DECK, C.M.
|1|
Lord Jesus, are we one with Thee!
O height and depth of love!
And crucified and dead with Thee,
Now one in heav'n above.
|2|
Ascended now, in glory bright,
Life-giving Head Thou art;
Nor life, nor death, nor depth, nor height,
Thy saints and Thee can part.
|3|
And soon shall come that glorious day,
When, seated on Thy throne,
Thou shalt to wond'ring worlds display
That we with Thee are one.
{97}
G. GILPIN, 7.7.8.7.7.7.8.7.
|1|
Head of the church, Thy body,
Firstborn of all creation!
Sweet to the saints it is to think
Of all Thine exaltation.
All power's to Thee committed,
All power on earth, in heaven;
To Thee a Name of widest fame
Above all glory's given.
|2|
With Thee believers raised
In Thee on high are seated;
All guilty once, but cleared by Thee:
Redemption-toil's completed.
And when Thou, Lord and Saviour,
Shalt come again in glory,
There by Thy side Thy spotless bride
Shall crown the wondrous story.
|3|
At length -- the state eternal,
No bound, no end possessing:
When heav'n and earth God, all in all,
Shall fill with largest blessing.
All root of evil banished,
No breath of sin to wither:
On earth -- on high -- nought else but joy,
And blissful peace for ever!
{98}
MISS C. THOMPSON (1822-1909), 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Gazing on thee, Lord, in glory,
While our hearts in worship bow,
There we read the wondrous story
Of the cross, its shame and woe.
|2|
Every mark of dark dishonour
Heaped upon the thorn-crowned brow,
All the depths of Thy heart's sorrow
Told in answ'ring glory now.
|3|
On that cross alone, forsaken,
Where no pitying eye was found;
Now to God's right hand exalted,
With Thy praise the heav'ns resound.
|4|
Did Thy God e'en then forsake Thee,
Hide His face from Thy deep need!
In Thy face, once marred and smitten,
All His glory now we read.
|5|
Gazing on it we adore Thee,
Blessed, precious, holy Lord!
Thou, the Lamb, alone art worthy!
This be earth's and heav'n's accord.
{99}
I WATTS, C.M.
|1|
Come, let us raise our joyful songs,
And thus approach the throne;
Had we ten thousand thousand tongues,
Our theme of joy's but one:
|2|
"Worthy the Lamb that's gone on high"
"To be exalted thus"
"Worthy the Lamb that died", we cry,
"For He was slain for us."
|3|
Jesus is worthy to receive
Honour and power divine;
And blessings more than we can give
Be, Lord, for ever Thine.
|4|
Soon shall the saints, exalted high,
A glorious anthem raise;
And all that dwell beneath the sky
Speak forth Thine endless praise.
|5|
Redeemed creation join in one
To bless the sacred Name
Of Him that sits upon the throne,
And to exalt the Lamb!
{100}
S. MEDLEY, L.M.
|1|
Now in a song of grateful praise
To our blest Lord the voice we'll raise;
With all His saints we'll join to tell
That Jesus "hath done all things well."

|2|
All worlds His glorious power confess,
His wisdom all His works express;
But, O His love! -- our tongues would tell
That Jesus "hath done all things well."
|3|
And since our souls have known His love,

What mercies has He made us prove;
Mercies which all our praise excel,
For Jesus "hath done all things well."
|4|
And when on that bright day we rise,
And join the anthems of the skies,
In heav'nly songs this note shall swell,
That Jesus "hath done all things well."
{101}

E DENNY, L.M.
|1|
O grace divine! the Saviour shed
His life-blood on th'accursed tree;
Bowed on the cross His blessed head,
And died to make His people free.
|2|
Through suff'ring there, beneath His feet
He trod the fierce destroyer down;
There power itself and weakness meet --
Emblem of each, yon thorny crown.
|3|
¬Twas mighty love's constraining power
That made Thee, blessed Saviour, die;
¬Twas love, in that tremendous hour,
That triumphed in Thy mighty cry.
|4|
¬Twas all for us -- our life we owe,
Our hope, our crown of joy, to Thee;
Thy suff'ring in that hour of woe --
Thy vict'ry, Lord -- hath made us free.
{102}
UNKNOWN, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Lord of life and King of glory,
Now to Thee our hearts we raise;
While we sing the joyful story
Of the triumphs of Thy grace.
|2|
Long in error's path benighted,
Deeply sunk in sin's abyss,
We Thy proffered mercy slighted,
Would not have eternal bliss.
|3|
Straying once on sin's dark mountain,
Thou didst bid us cease to roam,
Make us see the living fountain,
Call with power the wand'rers home.
|4|
Jesus, strength of our salvation,
None can pluck us from Thy hand;
In the hour of dark temptation
Kept by Thee we safely stand.
|5|
Though by enemies surrounded,
Onward still our way we wend;
All our foes shall be confounded,
Safely come our journey's end.
|6|
Grace begun shall end in glory;
Jesus, He the vict'ry won;
And His own triumphant story
Is the surety of our own.
{103}
T. KELLY (1769-1855) Adapted, 8.8.8.8.
|1|
We'll sing of the Shepherd that died,
That died for the sake of the flock;
His love to the utmost was tried,
But firmly endured as a rock.
|2|
What love from this Shepherd did flow,
When in care for the sheep He was led
To stand between them and the foe,

And lay down His life in their stead!
|3|
Our song then for ever shall be
Of the Shepherd who gave Himself thus;
No subject's so glorious as He,
No theme so affecting to us.
|4|
Of Him and His love will we sing,
His praises our tongues shall employ,
Till heavenly anthems we bring
In yonder bright regions of joy.
{104}
P. F. HILLER (1699-1769) from German, 8.7.8.7.8.7.7.
|1|
We wait for Thee, O Son of God,
And long for Thine appearing;
"A little while" -- Thou'lt come, O Lord,
Thy waiting people cheering.

Thus hast Thou said; we lift the head
In joyful expectation,
For Thou wilt bring salvation.
|2|
We wait for Thee, content to share
In patience, days of trial;
So meekly Thou the cross didst bear,
Our sin, reproach, denial.
How should not we receive with Thee
The cup of shame and sorrow,
Until the promised morrow?
|3|
We wait for Thee, for Thou, e'en here,
Hast won our hearts¬ affection;
In spirit still we find Thee near,
Our solace and protection.
In cloudless light and glory bright,
We soon with joy shall greet Thee,
And in the air shall meet Thee.
|4|
We wait for Thee -- Thou wilt arise,
Whilst hope her watch is keeping;
Forgotten then in glad surprise
Shall be our years of weeping.
Our hearts beat high, the dawn is nigh
That ends our pilgrim story
In Thine eternal glory.
{105}
T. KELLY (1769-1855), 8.7.8.7.4.7.
|1|
Glory, glory everlasting
Be to Him who bore the cross,
Who redeemed our souls by tasting
Death, the death deserved by us.
Spread His glory,
Who redeemed His people thus!
|2|
His is love, ¬tis love unbounded,
Without measure, without end;
Human thought is here confounded,
¬Tis too vast to comprehend.
Praise the Saviour!
Magnify the sinner's Friend!
|3|

While we tell the wondrous story
Of the Saviour's cross and shame,
Sing we, everlasting glory
Be to God and to the Lamb.
Hallelujah!
Give ye glory to His Name!
{106}
J G DECK, C.M.
|1|
O Lord, ¬tis joy to look above,
And see Thee on the throne,

To search the heights and depths of love
Which Thou to us hast shown;
|2|
To look beyond the long dark night,
And hail the coming day,
When Thou, to all Thy saints in light,
Thy glories wilt display.
|3|
And O ¬tis joy the path to trace,
By Thee so meekly trod,
Learning of Thee to walk in grace,
And fellowship with God;
|4|
Joy to confess Thy blessed Name,
The virtue of Thy blood,
And to the wearied heart proclaim
"Behold the Lamb of God!"
{107}
J G DECK, 8.8.6.8.8.6.
|1|
O Jesus, Lord, ¬tis joy to know
Thy path is o'er of shame and woe,
By Thee so meekly trod.
All finished is Thy work of toil,
Thou reapest now the fruit and spoil,
Exalted by our God.
|2|
Thy holy head, once bound with thorns,
The crown of glory now adorns;
Thy seat, the Father's throne.
O Lord, e'en now we sing Thy praise,
Ours the eternal song to raise,
Worthy the Lord alone!
|3|
We triumph in Thy triumphs, Lord,
Thy joys our deepest joys afford,
The fruit of love divine.
While sorrowing, suff'ring, toiling here,
How does the thought our spirits cheer,
The throne of glory's Thine!

H.D'A. CHAMPNEY, 8.5.8.5.8.5.8.5.
|1|
Blessed Lord, our hallelujahs
Now to Thee we raise;
Never could we fully utter
All Thy worth and praise.
Praise the Lamb! yes, Thou art worthy,
Who didst shed Thy blood

To redeem Thy saints and make us
Kings and priests to God.
|2|
Yes, we praise Thee, for Thou lov'st us;
And we bless Thee, Lord,
For the peace and joy and gladness
Which Thou dost afford.
Hallelujah! Thou, Lord Jesus,
Canst not cease to love;
Thine we are, and Thine for ever,
One with Thee above.
|3|
Praise the Lord! Yes, hallelujah!
Who would hush the song?
Join with saints from every nation,
Every tribe and tongue.
Praise the Lamb, for He is worthy,
Sweet eternal strain!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Praise the Lord! Amen.

J. G. DECK, 6.4.6.4.6.6.6.4.
|1|
Jesus! That name is love,
Jesus, our Lord!
Jesus, all names above,
Jesus, the Lord!
Thou, Lord, our all must be;
Nothing that's good have we,
Nothing apart from Thee,
Jesus, our Lord!
|2|
As Son of man it was,
Jesus, the Lord!
Thou gav'st Thy life for us,
Jesus, our Lord!
Great was indeed Thy love,
All other loves above;
Love Thou didst dearly prove,
Jesus, our Lord!
|3|
Righteous alone in Thee,
Jesus, the Lord!
Thou all our boast shalt be,
Jesus, our Lord!
Now unto God brought near,
His love dispels all fear;
Thy voice with joy we hear,
Jesus, our Lord!
|4|
Soon Thou wilt come again,
Jesus, the Lord!
Full joy our portion then,
Jesus, our Lord!
When Thine own face we see,
Then shall we like Thee be,
Then evermore with Thee,
Jesus, our Lord!
{110}
J. G. DECK, 8.8.8.8.8.8.
|1|
O God, Thou now hast glorified
Thy holy, well-beloved Son;
The Nazarene, the Crucified,
Now sits exalted on Thy throne.
To Him in faith we cry aloud,
Worthy art Thou, O Lamb of God!
|2|
Father, Thy holy name we bless!
Gracious and just Thy wise decree,
That every tongue shall soon confess
Jesus the Lord of all to be;
But O thy grace has taught us now
Before that Lord the knee to bow.
|3|
Him as our Lord we gladly own,
To Him alone we now would live,
Who bowed our hearts before Thy throne,
And gave us all that love could give.
Our willing voices cry aloud,
Worthy art Thou, O Lamb of God!
{111}
G. JYCKEL, 4.6.8.8.4.
|1|
Lord Jesus, come!
Nor let us longer roam
Afar from Thee and that bright place,
Where we shall see Thee face to face;
Lord Jesus, come!
|2|
Lord Jesus, come!
Thine absence here we mourn;
No joy we know apart from Thee,
No sorrow in Thy presence see;
Come, Jesus, come!
|3|
Lord Jesus, come!
And claim us as Thine own;
With longing hearts the path we tread,
Which Thee on high to glory led;
Come, Saviour, come!
|4|
Lord Jesus, come!
And take Thy people home;
That all Thy flock, so scattered here,
With Thee in glory may appear;
Lord Jesus, come!
{112}
H. BONAR, 7.6.7.6.
|1|
We love the name of Jesus,
The Christ of God, the Lord;
Like fragrance on the breezes
His Name is spread abroad.
|2|
We long to be with Jesus,
With all the ransomed throng,
To sing for aye His praises,
The one eternal song.
{113}
A. P. GIPPS, 11.10.11.10.
|1|
Lord Jesus, come, Thy saints for Thee are waiting,
To see Thy face and be with Thee at home;
E'en now our endless bliss anticipating,
With all our hearts we say, "Lord Jesus, come!"
|2|
Lord Jesus, come, our hearts for Thee are longing,
To share Thy joy in those bright courts above,
Where Thou wilt have Thy saints around Thee thronging,
In all the blessed fulness of Thy love.
|3|
Lord Jesus, come; with hearts and voices blending,
Soon shall we praise Thee in Thy Father's home;
Soon shall we sing the new song, never ending,
But now we sing to Thee, "Lord Jesus, come!"
{114}
J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), C.M.
|1|

Lord Jesus, source of every grace,
Glorious in light divine,
Soon shall we see Thee face to face,
And in that glory shine;
|2|
Be ever with Thee, hear Thy voice,
Unhindered then shall taste
The love which doth our hearts rejoice,
Though absent in this waste.
|3|
In peaceful wonder we adore
The thoughts of love divine,
Which in that world, for evermore,
Unite our lot with Thine.
{115}
T. KELLY (1769-1855), S.M.
|1|
Lead on, almighty Lord,
Lead on to victory;
Encouraged by Thy blessed word,
With joy we follow Thee.
|2|
We follow Thee, our Guide,
Who didst salvation bring;
We follow Thee, through grace supplied
From heav'n's eternal spring:
|3|
Till, of the prize possessed,
We hear of war no more,
And, O sweet thought! for ever rest
On yonder peaceful shore.
{116}
N. TATE & N. BRADY, L.M.
|1|
O render thanks to God above,
The fountain of eternal love;
How great the depth, how high it flows,
No saint can tell, no angel knows.
|2|
Its length and breadth no eye can trace,
No thought explore the bounds of grace;
The love Thy saints have known so well
Transcends the creature's power to tell.
{117}
E. DENNY (1796-1889), C.M.
|1|
O Lord, the bright and blessed hope,
That's cheered us through the past,
Of full eternal rest in Thee,
Will be fulfilled at last.
|2|
Undazzled by the glorious light
Which shines upon Thy face,
We'll see Thee then without a cloud --
Brought there through boundless grace.
|3|
Praise, endless praise, alone becomes
That bright and blessed place,
Where every eye beholds unveiled
The myst'ries of Thy grace.
|4|
Past conflict then: O Lord ¬tis ours
Through everlasting days
To sing our song of vict'ry there,
And only live to praise.
{118}
BERNARD OF CLAIRVAUX, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
Thy head once full of bruises,
So full of pain and scorn,
¬Mid other sore abuses
Mocked with a crown of thorn --
Thy head, once bowed and wounded
On the accursed tree,
Is now, O Lord, surrounded
With highest majesty.
|2|
Thy countenance transcendent --
O life-creating Sun
To worlds on Thee dependant!-
Was bruised and spit upon.
O Lord, what Thee tormented
Was our sins heavy load;
We had the debt augmented
Which Thou didst pay in blood.
|3|
We give Thee thanks unfeigned,
O Saviour, Friend in need!
For what Thy soul sustained
When Thou for us didst bleed.
Grant us to lean unshaken
Upon Thy faithfulness,
Until, to glory taken,
We see Thee face to face.
{119}
MISS N. VERGETTE, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Our God and father, we draw near to Thee
In all the worth of Thy beloved Son;
All Thou hast e'er desired from man we see
In Him, Thy Christ, Thine own anointed One.
|2|
No thought of His e'er moved apart from Thine;
Each holy footstep gave Thee fresh delight;
Perfect expression of Thy will divine
Thou hadst in Him -- come forth from glory bright.
|3|
Thou ever lovedst Him -- ere time began
He was beside Thee, object of Thy heart;
One with Thyself, in Thine eternal plan,
In Godhead glory one in all Thou art.
|4|
And now Thou lov'st Him, for Himself He gave --
Theme of our song when time shall cease to be;
Laid down His life that Thou, O God, shouldst have
Fruit of Thy love in sons who worship Thee.
{120}
J. G. DECK, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
O Lord, Thy love's unbounded,
So full, so vast, so free!
Our thoughts are all transported
Whene'er we think of Thee:
For us Thou cam'st from heaven,
For us to bleed and die,
That, purchased and forgiven,
We might ascend on high.
|2|
But O the hope of being
For ever with Thee, Lord,
The joyful hope of seeing
Thy face, for us so marred!
It fills our hearts with comfort,
It fills our lips with praise,
So that amidst our sorrow
A joyful song we raise.
|3|
O Lamb of God, we thank Thee,
We bless Thy holy Name
Thy love once made Thee willing

To bear our sin and shame.
And now Thy love is waiting
Thy saints like Thee to raise;
Firstborn of many brethren,
To Thee be all the praise!
|4|
O by Thy love constrain us,
And fix our hearts on Thee;
Let nothing henceforth pain us,
But that which paineth Thee;
Our joy, our blest endeavour,
Through suff'ring, conflict, shame,
To serve Thee, gracious Saviour,
And magnify Thy Name.
{121}
B G HARDINGHAM, C.M.
|1|
Lord Jesus, how our souls adore
That perfect love of Thine!
We'd sing its sweetness o'er and o'er,
Immeasurable, divine.
|2|
We think of Thee, God's blessed Son,
Whom heav'nly hosts obeyed,
Girding Thyself to serve Thine own,
And like a bondman made.
|3|
What deep affections moved Thee here,
As Thou didst seek Thy bride,
Joy of Thine heart, to Thee how dear!
Love could not be denied.
|4|
Thou gavest all that love could give,
The goodly pearl to gain;
Thou gav'st Thy life that we might live,
And Thou Thy bride obtain.
|5|
Fruit of that wondrous love of Thine,
We praise, we worship Thee;
Thy love unsearchable, divine,
Our endless song shall be.
{122}
J. JAY, 8.7.8.7.7.7.
|1|
God our Father, we Thy children
Seek Thy help this favoured hour;
Cover us with Thy protection;
Manifest Thy mighty power.
God and Father, bless us now,
As before Thy throne we bow.
|2|
Here we meet and wait before thee,
Drawn together through Thy grace;
Every interest precious to Thee
Finding in our hearts a place.
God our Father, bless us now,
As before Thy face we bow.
{123}
T. KELLY, C.M.
|1|

Awake each soul! Awake each tongue!
The subject is divine;
The Saviour's love demands our song;
Let all His people join.
|2|
This Saviour is the Mighty God,
The God of heav'n above;
Revealed in flesh, He shed His blood,
Blest proof of endless love.
|3|
Jesus, Thy love exceeds our thought;
But this al least we see:
The soul that knows Thy love is taught
To value nought but Thee.
{124}
MISS A. E. PRICE (1838-1919), C.M.

|1|
Jesus, our Lord, Thou Morning Star,
How well we know Thy Name!
Jesus, the Lord, the Crucified,
In glory still the same.
|2|
Jesus, the One who left the throne
To save a ruined race,
Thy love and lowliness still shine
Upon Thy glorious face.
|3|
Jesus, the One who trod the earth,
The lowly, subject One,
Obedience unto death was Thine,
God's well-beloved Son!
|4|
Jesus, what memories thrill our hearts
Of Thy blest footprints here,
While now to heav'n our eyes we turn
And gaze upon Thee there!
|5|
Jesus, our Saviour, quickly come,
That we may with Thee be;
Heav'n's morning breaks and glory dawns
When Thy blest face we see.
{125}
T. KELLY (1769-1855), C.M.
|1|
Behold the Lamb, with glory crowned!
To Him all power be giv'n;
No place too high for Him is found,
No place too high in heav'n.
|2|
He fills the throne -- the throne above;
Its rights to Him belong;
The object of His Father's love,
Theme of the ransomed's song.
|3|
Though high, yet He accepts the praise
His people offer here;
The faintest, feeblest note they raise
Will reach the Saviour's ear.
|4|
This song be ours, we join in one
To celebrate the Name
Of Him that sits upon the throne,
And to exalt the Lamb.
|5|
To Him whom men despise and slight,
To Him be glory giv'n:
The crown is His, and His by right
The highest place in heav'n.

How blest a Home! the Father's house:
There love divine doth rest;
What else could satisfy the hearts
Of those in Jesus blest?
His home made ours -- His Father's love
Our hearts¬ full portion giv'n,
The portion of the Firstborn Son,
The full delight of heav'n.
|2|
O what a home! The Son who knows --
He only -- all His love,
And brings us as His well-beloved
To that bright rest above,
Dwells in His bosom -- knoweth all
That in that bosom lies;
And came to earth to make it known,
That we might share His joys.
|3|
O what a home! there fullest love
Flows through its courts of light;
The Son's divine affections flow
Throughout its depth and height.
And full response the Father gives,
To fill with joy the heart;
No cloud is there to dim the scene
Or shadow to impart.
|4|
O what a home! But such His love
That He must bring us there,
To fill that home, to be with Him,
And all His glory share.
The Father's house, the Father's heart,
All that the Son is giv'n
Made ours, the objects of His love,
And He, our joy in heav'n.
{128}
MARY BOWLY, 6.6.8.4.6.6.8.4.
|1|
We are by Christ redeemed;
The cost -- His precious blood;
Be nothing by our souls esteemed
Like this great good.
Were the vast world our own,
With all its varied store,
And Thou, Lord Jesus, wert unknown,
We still were poor.
|2|
Our earthen vessels break;
The world itself grows old;
But soon the sleeping saints will wake,
And Thee behold.
Our bodies Thou wilt give
A fashion like Thine own;
Thou'lt bid the whole creation live,
And hush its groan.
|3|
Thus far by grace preserved,
Each moment speeds us on;
The crown and kingdom are reserved
Where Thou art gone.
When cloudless morning shines,
We shall Thy glory share;
In pleasant places are the lines;
The home how fair!
|4|
To Thee our weakness clings
Through tribulation sore,
And seeks the covert of Thy wings
Till all be o'er.
And when we've run the race,
And fought the faithful fight,
Then shall we see Thee face to face,
With saints in light.
{129}
T HAWEIS, 8.8.8.8.
|1|
Lord Jesus, to tell of Thy love
Our souls shall forever delight,
And sing of Thy glory above
In praises by day and by night.
|2|
Wherever we follow Thee, Lord,
Admiring, adoring, we see
That love which was stronger than death
Flow out without limit, and free.
|3|
Descending from glory on high,
With men Thy delight was to dwell,
Contented our Surety to die,
The love of Thy heart thus to tell.
|4|
Enduring the grief and the shame,
Thou barest our sins on the cross.
O who would not boast of this love,
And count the world's glory but loss?

R HAWKER (1753-1827), 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
"Abba Father," thus we greet Thee,
Magnify Thy holy Name;
Lifting holy hands we bless Thee,
Brought before Thee without blame,
We have learnt Thee here in sorrow,
Strangers in an alien land,
But we touch th'eternal morrow,
Abba, as in Christ we stand.
|2|
He has told us all the secrets
Hidden in that Name of grace;
Told us of the love that purposed
We should have with Christ our place.
Thus we bless Thee, "Abba Father,"
In the freedom He has won,
Taken into all the favour
Now made known in Christ, the Son.
|3|

Abba's purpose gave us being,
When in Christ, in that vast plan,
Abba chose the saints for glory
Long before the world began.
O what love the Father bore us!
O how precious in His sight,
When He gave His own to Jesus --
Jesus, His supreme delight!

|4|
"Abba Father," thus we know Thee
In that scene of brightest day;
¬Tis as sons foreknown we bless Thee;
None but sons can "Abba" say.
This high honour we inherit,
Fruit of counsel now declared,
By the Holy Spirit's witness
Consciously in sonship shared.
{131}
G W FRASER, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
Blest be the God and Father
Of Jesus Christ the Son,
Who chose us for all blessing
Ere time had yet begun;
That we, redeemed, His loved ones,
Might dwell with Him above,
And know the depth and fulness
Of His unbounded love.
|2|
Where all those deep affections,
Which fill the Father's heart,
Shall find their satisfaction,
Their joy to us impart;
Where we, Himself surrounding,
Shall "Abba, Father!" say,
Within those many mansions,
Prepared for that day.
|3|
E'en whilst we here are waiting
His rest on high to share,
We know our blest relation
As sons before Him there;
And by His Spirit's leading,
We "Abba, Father!" cry;
With ever-growing longing
We seek our place on high.

MISS F. T. WIGRAM (1831-1871), S.M.

The person of the Christ,
Enfolding every grace,
Once slain, but now alive again,
In heav'n demands our praise.
|2|
Gladly of Him we sing,
Since we with Him are dead;
Our life is hid with Christ in God,
In Christ the church's Head.

|3|
The heav'ns are opened now,
Sound it through earth abroad!
And we, by faith, in heav'n behold
Jesus the Christ our Lord.

Lord of glory, we adore Thee,
Christ of God, ascended high;
Heart and soul we bow before Thee,
Glorious now beyond the sky:
Thee we worship, Thee we praise,
Excellent in all Thy ways.
|2|
Mighty King, with glory crowned,
Rightful Heir and Lord of all;
Once rejected, scorned, disowned,

E'en by those Thou cam'st to call:
Thee we honour, Thee adore,
Glorious now and evermore.
|3|
Lord of life, to death once subject;
Blesser, yet a curse once made;
Of Thy Father's heart the object,
Yet in depths of anguish laid:
We in wonder Thee recall,
Bearing here our sorrows all.
|4|
Royal robes shall soon invest Thee,
Royal splendours crown Thy brow;
Christ of God, our souls confess Thee
King and Sovereign even now.
Thee we reverence, Thee obey,
Own Thee Lord and Christ alway.

I. FLEMING, 8.5.8.3.

Thee we praise, our God and Father,
Thou Thy love hast shown;
Ere the world was, Thou didst choose us
For Thine own.

Thou Thine only Son hast given,
Thou art glorified,
For, in love to bring us near Thee,
He has died.

|3|
By the Holy Ghost indwelling
We with Christ have part;
Father! we Thy sons now call Thee,
From our heart.
|4|
Love divine our present portion,
Heaven's choicest store;
Thee we worship, God and Father,
Thee adore!
|5|
Soon in Thine own house around Thee
Still our praise shall swell;
Sons before Thee ever joying
We shall dwell.
|6|
For His praise who glorified Thee
We like Him shall be;
Firstborn He of many brethren
Praising Thee.

T. WILLEY, 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
Father, spring and source of blessing,
Grateful praise to Thee we bring;
Objects of Thy sovereign favour,
Gladly of Thy love we sing;
Love that found its full expression
In Thy well-beloved Son,
Him who, dwelling in Thy bosom,
Could alone Thy love make known.
|2|	
Thine eternal, gracious purpose
Now to us in Christ is shown,
Purpose fraught with richest blessing
For the sons Thou hadst foreknown.
Brought to rest within the circle
Where love's treasures are displayed,
There we drink the living waters,
Taste the joys that never fade.
|3|
Brought to know Thy Well-beloved,
Drawn to Him in boundless grace --
Thine effulgence, love and glory
Shining in His blessed face --
We adore Thee, God and Father,
May Thy Name exalted be!
Praise and worship we would render
Now as in eternity.

J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), 10.10.10.10.

We praise Thee, Lord, blest source of deepest joy,
Responsive to Thy voice of holy love;
Thou living spring of bliss without alloy,
Bright inlet to the light of heav'n above!
|2|
We praise Thee, Lord, for in Thy blessed face
God's glory shines for us without a veil;
And now Thou leadest us in righteous grace
To that blest place where praises never fail.
|3|

We live of Thee, we've heard Thy quick'ning voice
Speaking of love beyond all human thought --
Thy Father's love, in which we now rejoice,
As those in spirit to Thy Father brought.
|4|
Thou hast made known the father, whom we've seen
In Thy blest Person -- infinite delight!
Yes, it suffices, though we here but glean
Some foretaste of His love, till all be light.
|5|
Father, Thou lovest! favour all divine,
A cloudless favour rests upon us here;
Thy face shines on us as it still doth shine
On Thy blest Son, whose image we shall bear.

All the way Thy love has trodden
We with gladness trace,
All Thy faithfulness and meekness,
All Thy grace.

To Thy Father's will obedient,
Thou to death hast been;
Righteousness and peace embracing
There are seen.
|4|
¬Tis as risen, Lord, we hail Thee --
Shadows passed away;
Love has triumphed, Thou hast made us
Thine for aye.

Joy we thus in thee, Lord Jesus,
Gladly praising Thee;

Thine the triumph, Thine the glory
Ever be!

Now the Father's name Thou tellest,
Joy is in Thine heart;
In His love in which Thou dwellest
We have part.

J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), 9.9.9.9.

This world is a wilderness wide;
We have nothing to seek nor to choose;
We've no thought in the waste to abide;
We have nought to regret nor to lose.
|2|
The Lord is Himself gone before;
He has marked out the path that we tread;
It's as sure as the love we adore;
We have nothing to fear nor to dread.
|3|
There is but that one in the waste,
Which His footsteps have marked as His own
And we follow in diligent haste
To the seats where He's put on His crown.
|4|
For the path where our Saviour is gone
Has led up to His Father and God,
To the place where He's now on the throne;
And His strength shall be ours on the road.
|5|
And with Him shall our rest be on high,
When in holiness bright we sit down,
In the joy of His love ever nigh,
In the peace that His presence shall crown.
|6|
¬Tis the treasure we've found in His love
That has made us now pilgrims below;
And ¬tis there, when we reach Him above,
As we're known, all His fulness we'll know.
|7|
And, Saviour! ¬tis Thee from on high
We await till the time Thou shalt come,
To take those Thou hast led by Thine eye
To Thyself in Thy heavenly home.
|7|
Till then ¬tis the path Thou hast trod
Our delight and our comfort shall be;
We're content with Thy staff and Thy rod,
Till with Thee all Thy glory we see.

O Lord, our hearts are waiting
That loud triumphant cry,
Which wakes the saints now sleeping,
And to Thee brings them nigh;
When we, with them ascending,
Shall meet Thee in the air,
To gaze upon Thy glory,
And all Thy likeness bear.
|2|
O hour for which in patience
Thou'rt waiting through the night,
Till all Thy saints are gathered,
And brought into the light!
Then, then the church completed,
God makes no more delay;
O Lord, with shouts of triumph
We pass into the day.
|3|
O hour of richest blessing!
When brought to Thee so nigh,
To be Thy joy for ever,
And dwell with Thee on high;
To rest in all that brightness,
And ever there abide;
To find Thy heart delighting
In us Thy heav'nly bride.
|4|
O blessed, coming Saviour,
Speak then the joyous word,
To which our hearts responding,
"For ever with the Lord."
And then with Thee, blest Saviour,
We evermore shall be,
In deepest, fullest blessing,
For ever one with Thee.

G W FRASER (1830-1896), 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
In deep eternal counsel,
Before the world was made,
Before its deep foundations
On nothingness were laid,
God purposed us for blessing,
And chose us in His Son,
To Him to be conformed,
When here our course was run.
|2|
In present, blest, acceptance
In Him who came to die,
In Him, who now is seated
At God's right hand on high:
In grace, which is unchanging,
We stand from day to day,
And prove the boundless mercies
Which strew our pilgrim way.
|3|
And when the day of glory
Shall burst upon this scene,
Dispelling all the darkness
Which deep'ning still had been;
O then He'll come in brightness,
Whom every eye shall see,
Arrayed in power and glory,
And we shall with Him be.
|4|
For He, who left His glory
To die upon the tree,
Will soon complete the story,
And we, His saints shall be
Conformed to His image;
As known, we then shall know,
And with abiding fervour
Our ceaseless praise shall flow.

We joy in our God, and sing of that love,
So sovereign and free, which did His heart move;
When lost our condition, all ruined, undone,
He saw with compassion, and spared not His Son.
|2|
His Son, His delight, His loved One, He gave,
The curse to endure -- by suff'ring to save;
Sure love so amazing, at Calvary told,
Since Him it hath given, no good will withhold.

We praise, then, our God: how rich is His grace!
Though far from Him once -- estranged from His face --
By blood we are purchased, are cleansed and made nigh,
And blest in Christ Jesus, our Saviour, on high.

Whom have we, Lord, but Thee,
Soul thirst to satisfy?
Exhaustless spring! The waters free!

All other streams are dry.
|2|
Our hearts by Thee are set
On brighter things above;
Strange that we ever should forget
Thine own most faithful love!
|3|
Our portion faileth not,
For Thou dost give as God;
Secure in thee our happy lot
Through the redeeming blood.
|4|
None like the ransomed host
That precious blood have known;
Redemption gives faith's holy boast
To draw so near the throne.
|5|
Higher and higher yet,
In Thee, through blood, made nigh;
We taste the love that knows no let,
And "Abba, Father!" cry.

R C CHAPMAN (1803-1902), 7.7.7.7.
|1|
King of glory, set on high,
Girt with strength and majesty,
We Thy holy Name confess,
Thee with adoration bless.
|2|
Jesus, mighty Son of god,
Wondrous gift on man bestowed:
Many crowns are on Thy head,

Glorious Firstborn from the dead!
|3|
Gladly, Lord, we bow the knee,
By the Father's just decree,
To His own anointed One,
To His well-beloved Son.

G A LUCAS, 7.6.7.6.
|1|
Thy suff'ring love, Lord Jesus,
Our hearts delight to trace;
The love that sought and claimed us,
In strong yet tender grace.
|2|
We think of Thy devotion,
Thy blest obedience rare;
Thy holy, deep emotion,
Thy grief that none could share.
|3|
Thus to our hearts Thou speakest;
Blest Lord, we hear Thy voice;
We know its charm, its sweetness,
And in Thy love rejoice.
|4|
We wait the consummation
Of love's own work divine,
And now in adoration
We joy that we are Thine.

|1|	
Lord Jesus, we remember
The travail of Thy soul,
When through Thy love's deep pity,
The waves did o'er Thee roll.
Baptised in death's dark waters,
For us Thy blood was shed;
For us Thou, Lord of glory,
Wast numbered with the dead.
|2|
O Lord, Thou now art risen,
Thy travail all is o'er;
For sin Thou once hast suffered,
Thou liv'st to die no more.
Sin, death and hell are vanquished
By Thee, the church's Head;
And lo! we share Thy triumphs
Thou first-born from the dead.
|3|
Unto Thy death baptised,
We own with Thee we died;
With Thee, our life, we're risen,
And shall be glorified.
From sin, the world, and Satan,
We're ransomed by Thy blood;
And here would walk as strangers,
Alive with Thee to God.

Thou art the blest incarnate Word,
The Father's only Son,
God manifest, God seen and heard,
The heav'n's beloved One;
Worthy, O Lamb of God, art Thou,
That every knee to Thee should bow!
|2|
In Thee most perfectly expressed
The Father's self doth shine:
Thou of full Deity possessed,
Eternally divine.
Worthy, O Lamb of God, art Thou,
That every knee to Thee should bow!
|3|
Image of th¬ Infinite Unseen,
Whose Being none can know;
Brightness of light no eye hath seen,
God's love revealed below;
Worthy, O Lamb of God, art Thou,
That every knee to Thee should bow!
|4|
The higher myst'ries of Thy fame
The creature's grasp transcend;
The Father only (glorious claim!)
The Son can comprehend.
Worthy, O Lamb of God, art Thou,
That every knee to Thee should bow!
|5|
Yet loving Thee, on whom His lov
Ineffable doth rest,
The worshippers, O Lord, above,
As one with Thee, are blest.
Worthy, O Lamb of God, art Thou,
That every knee to Thee should bow!
|6|
Of the vast universe of bliss
The centre Thou and Sun;
Th¬ eternal theme of praise is this,
To heav'n's beloved One:
Worthy, O Lamb of God, art Thou,
That every knee to Thee should bow!

J. G. DECK (1807-1884), C.M.
|1|
Lord Jesus, when we think of Thee,
Of all Thy love and grace,
Our spirits long and fain would see
Thy beauty, face to face.
|2|
And though the wilderness we tread,
A barren, thirsty ground,
With thorns and briars overspread,
Where foes and snares abound;
|3|
Yet in Thy love such depths we see,
Our souls well o'erflow with praise --
Content ourselves, while, Lord, to Thee
A joyful song we raise.
|4|
Our Lord, our Life, our rest, our Shield,
Our Rock, our Food, our Light;
Each thought of Thee doth constant yield
Unchanging, fresh delight.
|5|
Blest Saviour, keep our spirits stayed,
Hard following after Thee,
Till we, in robes of white arrayed,
Thy face in glory see.

L. G. MILNER, 6.4.6.4.6.6.6.4.
|1|

Thou, Lord, to death's domain
Didst go alone.
Death had on Thee no claim,
Thou sinless One!

He who had death's dread power
Met Thee in that dark hour:
Vanquished by Thee his power,
By Thee alone.
|2|
But Thou hast burst the grave,
Risen art Thou;
Death could not Thee enslave,
Death had to bow!
Victorious hast Thou come
Out of the darksome tomb,
Broken the bands of gloom:
Beyond death now.
|3|
What mighty triumphs, Lord,
Thou didst achieve!
What fruitfulness doth God
From Thee receive!
Out of Thy death has sprung
A wondrous living throng:
All, all to Thee belong,
And in Thee live.
|4|
Firstborn of all Thou art,
Lowly we bow;
Chief in Thy Father's heart --
Chief to us now.
Thou art indeed supreme,
Our great eternal theme,
Worthy of all esteem:
Worthy art Thou!

O for the robe of whiteness,
To walk with Christ in light;
O for the glorious brightness
Of day without a night!
|2|
We would a name of favour,
Graved on the stone of white;
We'd taste that manna's flavour,
Reserved for heav'n's delight.
|3|
¬Tis sweet the thought of rising
The risen Lord to meet;
Or changed, ourselves surprising,
Like Him for whom we wait.

What joy supreme in seeing
The Saviour face to face,
The peaceful joy of being
For ever in that place!

MISS A. TAYLOR (1782-1866), 6.6.6.6.8.8.
|1|
What was it, blessed God,
Led Thee to give Thy Son,
To yield Thy Well-beloved
For us by sin undone?
¬Twas love unbounded led Thee thus

To give Thy Well-beloved for us.
|2|
What led Thy Son, O God,
To leave Thy throne on high,
To shed His precious blood,
To suffer and to die?
¬Twas love, unbounded love to us,
Led Him to die and suffer thus.
|3|
What moved Thee to impart
Thy Spirit from above,
Therewith to fill our heart
With heav'nly peace and love?
¬Twas love, unbounded love to us,
Moved Thee to give Thy Spirit thus.
|4|
What love to Thee we owe,
Our God, for all Thy grace!
Our hearts may well o'erflow
In everlasting praise.
Gladly, O God, we praise Thee thus
For all Thy boundless love to us.

"Praise ye the Lord," again, again,
The Spirit strikes the chord;
Nor toucheth He our hearts in vain:
We praise, we praise the Lord.
|2|
Rejoice in Him, ye saints, again,
The Spirit speaks the word;
And faith takes up the happy strain:
Our joy is in the Lord.
|3|
For ever be the glory giv'n
O Lamb of God, to Thee!
Thyself, O Lord, on earth, in heav'n,
Our theme of joy shalt be.

Our adoration bring,
And bow before Thy face.
Thy Son hath brought Thy love to light;
In songs of joy we now unite.

Accepted in Thy Son,
We "Abba, Father!" cry;
Through Him Thy love is known,
In Him we are brought nigh.
With rev'rence and with love we bow
To Thee, O God, our Father Thou!

A M TOPLADY, 8.8.8.8.8.8.

Lord, Thou hast drawn us after Thee,
So let us run and never tire;
Thy presence shall our comfort be,
Thyself our hope, our sole desire,
Our present Saviour, while nor fear
Nor sin can come if Thou art near.
|2|
What in Thy love possess we not!
Our star by night, our sun by day,
Our spring of life when parched with drought,
Our wine to cheer, our bread to stay;
Our strength, our shield, our safe abode,
Our robe before the throne of God.
|3|
Unchangeable Thy gracious love
Our earthly path has ceaseless viewed;
Ere yet these beating hearts could move,
Thy tender mercies still pursued;
Ever with us may they abide,
And close us in on every side.

"A little while" -- the Lord shall come,
And we shall wander here no more;
He'll take us to His Father's home,
Where He for us is gone before,
To dwell with Him, to see His face,
And sing the glories of His grace.
|2|
"A little while" -- He'll come again;
Let us the precious hours redeem;
Our only grief to give Him pain,
Our joy to serve and follow Him.
Watching and ready may we be,
As those that wait their Lord to see.

|3|
"A little while" -- ¬twill soon be past;
Why should we shun the promised cross?
O let us in His footsteps haste,
Counting for Him all else but loss!
For how will recompense His smile
The suff'rings of this "little while!"
|4|
"A little while" -- come, Saviour, come!
For Thee Thy saints have tarried long;
O take Thy waiting pilgrims home,
To sing the new eternal song,
To see Thy glory, and to be
In everything conformed to Thee!

O bright and blessed hope!
When shall it be

That we His face, long loved,
Revealed shall see?
|2|
O when, without a cloud,
His features trace,
Whose faithful love so long
We've known in grace;
|3|
That love itself enjoy,
Which, ever true,
Did in our feeble path
Its work pursue?
|4|
O Jesus! not unknown,
Thy love shall fill
The heart in which Thou dwell'st,
And shalt dwell still.
|5|
Still, Lord, to see Thy face,
Thy voice to hear;
To know Thy present love,
For ever near;
|6|
To gaze upon Thyself
So faithful known,
Long proved in secret help
With Thee alone;
|7
To see that love, content,
On us flow forth,
For ever Thy delight,
Clothed with Thy worth!
|8|
Nor what is next Thy heart
Can we forget;
Thy saints, O Lord, with Thee
In glory met.
|9|
Perfect in comeliness
Before Thy face,
Th¬ eternal witness, all,
Of Thine own grace;
|10|
Together then their songs
Of endless praise,
With one harmonious voice,
In joy they'll raise!

Of God's love the object meet;
While, Lord Jesus Christ, ¬tis through Thee
All our blessing is complete.
|2|
As Thy brethren now we hail Thee,
Firstborn of a heav'nly race;
He who has with glory crowned Thee
Called us to this blessed place.
|3|
From the triumph and the glory
Of Thy rest in love divine,
Comes to us the wondrous story,
How God's purpose made us Thine;
|4|
How by dying Thou hast freed us
From the man of sin and shame,
That, unhindered, Thou mightst lead us
Now to know Thy Father's name.
|5|
And, responsive to Thy longing,
We would now abide in love;
Know Thy joy, as those belonging
To Thyself in heav'n above.
|6|
Thus in holy adoration
At Thy feet our hearts would bow,
Who hast brought, in new creation,
Sons of God before Him now.
|7|
And a song is sweetly thrilling
Every heart within the shrine:
Music which God's ear is filling,
Notes which could be only Thine.

For ever with the Lord!
Amen! so let it be:
Life from the dead is in that word,
¬Tis immortality.

Here in the body pent,
Absent from Him we roam,
Yet nightly pitch our moving tent
A day's march nearer home.
|3|
And though there intervene
Rough seas and stormy skies,
Yet, by no mortal vision seen,
His glory fills our eyes!
|4|
There shall all clouds depart,
The wilderness shall cease,
And sweetly shall each gladdened heart
Enjoy eternal peace.

Shall fill yon courts through endless days,
When time shall cease to be!
Round and around the notes shall swell,
As each redeemed one joins to tell
Thy love, so vast and free.

Each shall the Saviour's likeness bear,
A royal crown each brow shall wear,
And robes unsullied white.
The everlasting song shall be
To Thee, O Lamb of God, to thee,
¬Mid scenes of purest light.
|3|
Our joy unhindered then with Thee,
Our eyes undimmed Thy glory see,
Whilst worthy praise we give.
Through that eternal cloudless day,
Our burning hearts with rapture say
"He died that we might live".

We sing the praise of Him who died,
Of Him who died upon the cross,
The sinner's hope -- let men deride;
For this we count the world but loss.

Inscribed upon the cross we see,
In shining letters "God is love!"
The Lamb who died upon the tree
Has brought us mercy from above.
|3|
He took our sin and guilt away,
He holds the fainting spirit up;
He cheers with hope the gloomy day,
And sweetens every bitter cup.
|4|
He makes the coward spirit brave,
And nerves the feeble arm to fight;
He takes all terror from the grave,
And gilds the bed of death with light.
|5|
Thou art, O Lord, the cure of woe,
The measure and the pledge of love,
The sinner's refuge here below,
Our theme of praise in heav'n above.

And finds its solace in Thyself alone;
Unspoken fears, and questions hard to solve,
Before the rays of heav'nly light dissolve.

Thy well-proved love our confidence inspires
To count upon the grace that never tires;
And with thanksgiving wait on Thee in prayer,
Nor from a patient watch thereto forbear.

A prospect bright, unfailing;
Where God shall shine, in light divine,
In glory never fading.

A home above, of peace and love,
Close to Thy holy person;
Thy saints shall there see glory fair,
And shine as Thy reflection.

O how we long to join the song
To Thee in glory rendered;
And there to flow with love's full glow,
With hearts like Thine surrounded;

No more as here, ¬mid snares, to fear
A thought or wish unholy;
No more to pain the Lamb once slain,
But live to love Thee wholly;
|5|
No more to view Thy chosen few,
As here on earth, divided;
But drink in peace the living grace
That gave them hearts united.

That prospect bright, unfailing;
Where God shall shine, in light divine,

We worship now.
So perfect in Thy matchless grace,
So spotless, pure in all Thy ways!
To Thee we bow.

In Thee all human graces blend,
And to Thy Father e'er ascend
As incense rare;
Fragrant to Him Thou ever art,
Source of rejoicing to His heart,

Most sweet and fair.

Beyond all praise of tongue or pen,
Thou peerless One!
In grace, in patient tenderness,
In truth, in holy faithfulness,
Supreme alone!

Lord, we love to trace Thy footprints
Here amidst the desert sand,
Ponder o'er Thy path of suffering --
Wondrous heart and healing hand;
Learn Thy love at Bethlehem's manger,
Hear Thee still the raging wave,
See Thee at the well of Sychar,
On the cross, and in the grave.

Lord, we bow in adoration
As we watch that stream of love;
Find its mighty tide still flowing
From Thee now as crowned above.
¬Tis a love no heart can fathom,
Which to us Thou dost unfold,
Inexhaustible and boundless --
Wondrous theme that ne'er grows old.

And fix and root us in Thy grace,

O tell us often of Thy love,
Of all Thy grief and pain;
And let our hearts with joy confess
That thence comes all our gain.
|3|
For this, O may we freely count
What e'er we have but dross;
The dearest object of our love,
Compared with Thee, but loss.

Engrave this deeply on our hearts
With an eternal pen,
That we may, in a fuller way,
Return Thy love again.

How bright then that day when the Saviour appears!
How welcome to those who have shared in His cross!
A crown incorruptible then will be theirs,
A rich compensation for suff'ring and loss.

No loss in this world can compare with that day,
With glory that then will from heav'n be revealed.
The Saviour is coming, His people may say,
Our Lord whom we look for, our Sun and our Shield.

For where Thou art Thine own must be;
Love will not be alone;
Love's resting-place together shared

Through grace to be Thine own.

To follow and to serve Thee here
Do Thou our hearts incline;
To be for Thee where Thou hast been,
Until we reach Thee in that scene
Where Thou wilt own us Thine.

From earthliness be free;

Renewed in strength, the path we'd tread

Here nature's voice is silenced,
And natures claims give way;
The Spirit's realm commands us
On this most favoured day.

O Lord, with deep emotion
Thyself we magnify;
And own Thy love suffices
Our hearts to satisfy.

F. WHITFIELD (1827-1904), C.M.
|1|
There is a Name we love to hear,
We love to sing its worth;
It sounds like music in our ear,
The sweetest Name on earth.
|2|
It tells us of a Saviour's love,
Who died to set us free;
It tells us of His precious blood,
The sinner's perfect plea.
|3|
Jesus! the Name we love so well,
The Name we love to hear;
No saint on earth its worth can tell,
No heart conceive how dear.
|4|
This Name shall shed its fragrance still
Along life's thorny road,
Shall sweetly smooth the rugged hill
That leads us up to God.
|5|
And there the whole triumphant throng
Of blood-bought saints on high
Shall sing the new eternal song,
With Jesus ever nigh.

H BENNETT, S.M.

We have a home above,
From all defilement free;
A mansion which eternal love
Prepared our rest to be.
|2|
The Comforter is come,
The Spirit has been giv'n:
He leads us onward to the home
Reserved for us in heav'n.
|3|
Thy love, most gracious Lord,
Our joy and strength shall be,
Till Thou shalt speak the gladd'ning word
That bids us rise to Thee.
|4|
And then through endless days,
Where all Thy glories shine,
In happier, holier strains we'll praise
The grace that made us Thine.

MISS M. BOWLY (1813-1856), C.M.
|1|
Jesus, of Thee we ne'er would tire;
The new and living food
Can satisfy the heart's desire
Of those redeemed by blood.
|2|
If such the happy midnight song
Our prisoned spirits raise,
What are the joys that cause, ere long,
Eternal bursts of praise!
|3|
To look within and see no stain,
Abroad no curse to trace;
To shed no tears, to feel no pain,
But see Thee face to face;
|4|
To find each hope of glory gained,
Fulfilled each precious word;
And fully all to have attained
The image of our Lord.
|5|
For this we're pressing onward still,
And in this hope would be
More subject to the Father's will,
E'en now much more like Thee.

T. ROFE, 8.7.8.7. IAMBIC
|1|
Our God we bless Thee for Thy love
Made manifest in Jesus;
We praise Thy Name, that by His death
Thy love from bondage frees us.
|2|
The darkness and the distance gone,
No longer room for sadness;
Love's disposition now made known,
Thy saints are filled with gladness.
|3|
Thine attributes, O God, are seen
In Jesus crowned with glory,
And in our hearts Thy praises ring
As with Him now before Thee.
|4|
A people formed to show Thy praise,
From every tongue and nation,
And, in the nearness of Thy love,
In covenant relation.
|5|
Thy willing people, formed in love
From which no power shall sever,
With great delight, with holy hands,
We'd serve Thee thus for ever.

O Lord, Thy wondrous story
Our inmost soul doth move,
And, ending in the glory,
We trace Thy path of love.
|2|
No eye was found to pity,
No heart to bear Thy woe,
But shame, and scorn, and spitting:
None cared Thy Name to know.
|3|
O day of greatest sorrow,
Day of unfathomed grief!
When Thou didst taste the horror
Of wrath without relief.
|4|
Thus, with all grief acquainted,
Blest Man of sorrows here,
Thy love, by ill untainted,

To death Thy feet did bear.

In death, obedience yielding
To God Thy Father's will,
Love still its power was wielding
To meet all human ill.

Jesus, our Lord, on the throne of the Father Thou'rt crowned;
Thou once on Calvary suff'redst, of man the disowned;
Worthy art Thou!
Glory encircles Thy brow,
Once the despised, now enthroned!

We Thy beloved, assembled, remember Thy dying;
Unto Thy death, blessed Lord, our full hearts are replying;
Thou hast loved us --
Jesus, who gav'st Thyself thus!
We on Thy love are relying.

Here upon earth, till Thy coming, Thy death we are showing;
But unto Thee in the glory our hearts are outgoing;
To Thee above,
Centre of glory and love,
Gladly our worship is flowing.

O Lord, amid corruption,
Where hatred did abound,
Thy path of true perfection
Was light on all around.
|2|
In scorn, neglect reviling,
Thy patient grace stood fast,
Man's malice unavailing
To move Thy heart to haste.
|3|
O'er all, Thy perfect goodness
Rose blessedly divine;
Poor hearts opprest with sadness
Found ever rest in Thine.
|4|
The strong man in his armour
Thou mettest in Thy grace,
Didst spoil the mighty charmer
Of our unhappy race.
|5|
Disease, and death, and demon,
All fled before Thy word,
As darkness, the dominion
Of day's returning lord!
|6|
Love, that made Thee a mourner
In this sad world of woe,
Proved wretched man a scorner
Of grace that brought Thee low.

O Lord, Thy love's sweet savour
Shone forth in every deed,
And showed God's loving favour
To every soul in need.

¬Tis sweet to think of those at rest,
Who sleep in Christ the Lord,
Whose spirits now with Him are blest,
According to His word.
|2|
They once were pilgrims here with us;
Through Jesus now they sleep;
And we for them, while resting thus,
As hopeless cannot weep.
|3|
We cannot linger o'er the tomb,
The resurrection day
To faith shines bright beyond its gloom,
Christ's glory to display.
|4|
How bright the resurrection morn
On all the saints will break!
The Lord Himself will then return,
His ransomed hosts to take.

Our Lord Himself we then shall see,
Whose blood for us was shed;
With Him for ever we shall be,
Made like our glorious Head.

Worthy by all to be adored,
Exhaustless theme of heav'nly lays,

To Thee e'en now our song we raise,
Though sure the tribute mean must prove;
No mortal tongue can tell Thy ways,
So full of life, and light, and love.

Yet, Saviour, Thou shalt have full praise;
We soon shall meet Thee on the cloud;
We soon shall see Thee face to face,
In glory praising as we would.

O God what cords of love are Thine,
How gentle, yet how strong!
Thy truth and grace their strength combine
To draw our souls along.

The guilt of twice ten thousand sins
Christ's blood has washed away;
And when the fight of faith begins
Our strength is as our day.

Comfort through all this vale of tears
In blest profusion flows;
And glory of unnumbered years
Eternity bestows.

Drawn by such cords we'll onward move,
Till round the throne we meet,
And, captives in the chains of love,
Embrace our Saviour's feet.

Of all the Author Thou;
Upholder of the universe,
To Thee as God we bow.

The creature mind, howe'er sublime,
Thine Essence cannot know,
Yet we, to Thee, in majesty,
With reverence bend low.

But in Thy manhood's glorious state
Our thankful hearts rejoice;
For of Thy body, Lord, are we,
Of love divine the choice.

Great source of wisdom, power and food,
All riches from Thee flow;
Thou on Thy church, Thy fulness here,
All treasure dost bestow.

In nearness here to Thee on high
In heav'nly measures sing.

Our woe is Thine, Lord Jesus;
Our joy is in Thy love;
But woe and joy all lead us
To Thee in heav'n above.

To Thee we look, Lord Jesus,
To Thee whose love we know;
We wait the power that frees us
From bondage, sin and woe.

We look for Thine appearing,
Thy presence here to bless;
We greet the day that's nearing,
When all this woe shall cease.

But O for us, blest Saviour,
How brighter far the lot,
To be with Thee for ever,
Where evil enters not!
|6|
To see Thee who hast loved us,
Then face to face above,
Whose grace at first had moved us
To taste and know Thy love!
|7|
With Thee, O Lord, for ever
Our souls shall be content;
Nor act, nor thought shall ever
Full joy with Thee prevent.

Thy Father's perfect favour
Our dwelling place shall be;
And all His glory ever
Shine forth on us through Thee.

O come then soon, Lord Jesus,
In patience still we wait --
Await the power that frees us --
Our longed-for heav'nly seat.

Joy, that Thou couldst pity thus:

What heights and depths of love divine
Will there through endless ages shine!

When the last tear shall dim our eyes,
When He will wipe these tears away,
And fill our hearts with glad surprise;
To hear His voice and see His face,
And know the fulness of His grace.

God and Father, we Thy children
Would in meekness hear Thy word;
Undistracted, hearts responsive,

All Thy mind we would be learning,
As the desert path we trace;
Thine we are, and would be leaning
Ever on Thy boundless grace.

Still the Spirit is unfolding
Heights of glory Thou hast giv'n,
And our eyes by faith are seeing
Christ at Thy right hand in heav'n;
As on earth His path was trodden,
Ever subject to Thy will,
As the Man of all Thy counsels,
Who the universe will fill.

When our hearts this place accord Him,
When as Isaac, He has come,
We shall then in answer to Him,
Cast out Hagar and her son;
Then our hearts bow down before Him,
This world's glory waxeth dim;
Every hindrance then must vanish,
All be subject unto Him.

God our Father, Thee we worship,
Praise Thee evermore that Thou
Leadest us in triumph, telling
All Thy boundless love e'en now.
May we therefore still be learning,
In Thy word Thy counsels trace,
Till the day that Thou displayest
All the glory of Thy grace!

And there with joy Thou wilt Thy ransomed greet;

How will our ears drink in His well-known voice,
Whose faintest whisper makes our souls rejoice!

No jarring notes shall there discordant sound;
All pure without, all pure within the breast;
No thorns to wound, no toil to mar our rest.

Lift our poor hearts this weary world above:
If even here the taste of heav'nly springs
So cheers the spirit that the pilgrim sings:--

What the unmingled fulness of His love!
What hallelujahs will His presence raise!
What but one loud eternal burst of praise!

The love told out in suff'ring on the tree --
Love that has gathered now within its clasp
Those once far off, but now brought home to Thee.

In Thee! its fulness told -- so that the heart,
Touched by Thy kindness, finds in Thee its rest,
And lost in Thee, adoring, knows its part.

And love's full fountain in its depths revealed,
Call forth from every mouth Thine endless praise,
And willing lips their heart-felt homage yield.

When Israel, by divine command,
The pathless desert trod,
They found throughout the barren land
A sure resource in God.

A cloudy pillar marked the road,
Their food was bread from heav'n;
From the hard rock the water flowed --
Supplies divinely giv'n.

Like them, we have a rest in view,
Secure from hostile powers;
Like them, we pass a desert too:
But Israel's God is ours.

His word a light before us spreads,
By which our path we see;
His love, a banner o'er our heads,
From harm preserves us free.

To be our daily food;
Within us dwells the spring from heav'n,
The Spirit of our God.

Of grace for every day!

Throughout our desert way.

Where man Thy rights did spurn;

Is centred in the Son;
And countless tongues in heav'n unite
To tell what He hath done.
|3|
The Father made us meet
With saints in light to dwell;
And now we chant His praises sweet,
Whose love we know so well.
|4|
E'en now we taste the love,
And know the mighty power,
By which we'll rise to realms above
When waiting time is o'er.
|5|
There glory bright and fair
Shines with celestial beam;
For He who suffered once is there,
Its centre and its theme.
|6|
The Lamb enthroned shall there
Engage each raptured heart;
While myriad saints Christ's likeness bear,
And have with Him their part.
|7|
Praise Him again, again!
For us the cross He bore;
Now all is Yea, and all Amen,
In Him for evermore.

H F NUNNERLEY, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
O glorious Lord! what thoughts Thy mind did fill,
When from Thy God Thou cam'st to do His will!
How deep, indeed, the joy that filled Thy heart --
That myriad sons with Thee should find their part!
|2|
Thy brethren, Lord, Thine own and one with Thee,
Thy thoughts engaged when dying on the tree;
Thy church complete and in Thy beauty dressed --
The day of God, and love divine at rest.
|3|
O blessed Lord! those treasured thoughts unfold
In light divine, as we Thy face behold;
And on our view unbounded glories break,
That speak Thy fame, and songs eternal wake.
{227}
Dr ROSSIER (1835-1928), C.M.
|1|
Lord, e'en to death Thy love could go,
A death of shame and loss,
To vanquish for us every foe,
And break the strong man's force.
|2|
O what a load was Thine to bear
Alone in that dark hour!
Sin's weight in all its terror there,
God's wrath and Satan's power!
|3|
The storm that burst o'er Thy blest head
Is hushed for ever now,
And rest divine is ours instead,
Whilst glory crowns Thy brow.
|4|
Within the Father's house on high
We soon shall sing Thy praise;
But here, where Thou didst bleed and die,
We learn that song to raise.
{228}
I WATTS, 6.6.6.6.8.8.
|1|
Join all the glorious names
Of wisdom, love and power,
That mortals ever knew,
That angels ever bore;
All are too mean to speak His worth,
Too mean to set the Saviour forth.
|2|
Great Prophet of our God!
Our tongues must bless Thy Name,
By whom the joyful news
Of free salvation came;
The joyful news of sins forgiv'n,
Of hell subdued, of peace with heav'n.
|3|
Thou art our Counsellor,
Our Pattern and our Guide;
And Thou our Shepherd art --
Ah! keep us near Thy side;
Nor let our feet e'er turn astray,
To wander in a crooked way.
|4|
We love the Shepherd's voice;
His watchful eye shall keep
Our pilgrim souls among
The thousands of God's sheep;
He feeds His flock, He calls their names,
And gently leads the tender lambs.
{229}
H.D'A. CHAMPNEY, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
Thy Name must live, whatever names may die;
It must fill all the earth, as heav'n on high.
Jesus! Thy Name by all shall yet be known,
All kings and nations shall Thy greatness own.
|2|
Thou livest, Saviour, and all grace is there,
That with such beauty shone in Thee down here;
No trait is lost, each beauteous grace is found,
All brought through death to resurrection ground.

J. G. DECK (1807-1884), C.M.
|1|
O Lord, when we the path retrace
Which Thou on earth hast trod,
To man Thy wondrous love and grace,
Thy faithfulness to God:--
|2|
Thy love, by man so sorely tried,
Proved stronger than the grave;
Though man in hatred pierced Thy side,
Thy blood love's answer gave;
|3|
Faithful amidst unfaithfulness,
¬Mid darkness only light,
Thou didst Thy Father's name confess,
And in His will delight;
|4|
Unmoved by Satan's subtle wiles,
Or suff'ring, shame and loss,
Thy path, uncheered by earthly smiles,
Led only to the cross:--
|5|
We wonder at Thy lowly mind,
And fain would like Thee be,
And all our rest and pleasure find
In learning, Lord, of Thee.

C. C. ELLIOTT, 7.7.7.7.

Father, to Thy gracious throne
We draw nigh in all our need,
In the Name of Him alone
Who for us in heav'n doth plead.
|2|
May Thy holy Name be praised
Now on earth as ¬tis in heav'n;
May Thy glory high be raised,
Unto Thee all worship giv'n.
|3|
Here on earth beset by foes,
Well beloved by Christ her Head,
May Thy church in love's repose
Her appointed journey tread.
|4|
May the Christ dwell in our heart,
Known in love past human ken:
Joying in our heav'nly part,
Counsel deep and vast for men.
|5|
May we here our strength renew,
Mount with eagle's wings above,
Run the race with Him in view,
Faint not here, but walk in love.

J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), 7.6.7.6.

We see Thee, Lord of glory,
Descending from above,
And learn the wondrous story
Of God come down in love.
|2|
Thus cradled in a manger,
We see Thee, Jesus, there,
A houseless, homeless Stranger,
Our sorrows all to share.
|3|
O strange yet fit beginning
Of all that life of woe,
In which Thy grace was winning
Poor man his God to know.
|4|
O love, all thought surpassing!
That Thou shouldst with us be,
Nor yet in triumph passing,
But human infancy!
|5|
We gaze upon Thy weakness --
The manger and the cross;
We love Thee for Thy meekness
Through suff'ring, pain and loss.
|6|
We see the Godhead glory
Shine through that human veil,
And, willing, hear the story
Of love that's come to heal.

T H REYNOLDS, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Jesus, Lord, we've come together
In the bonds of Thine own love;
Thou hast drawn our footsteps hither,
Its deep meaning now to prove.
|2|
In such bonds the world around us --
Full of conflict, foes and strife --
Has no place, since love has bound us
In one fellowship of life.
|3|
Here together we recall Thee,
In these emblems hear Thy voice;
Never more can grief befall Thee;
Thou art risen, we rejoice.
|4|
But Thy love's remains, that entered
Into death to make us Thine;
In that death all love was centred --
O the depths of love divine!
|5|
Thou dost make us taste the blessing,
Soon to fill a world of bliss;
And we bless Thy Name, confessing
Thine own love our portion is.
|6|
Sweet it is to sit before Thee,
Sweet to hear Thy blessed voice,
Sweet to worship and adore Thee,
While our hearts in Thee rejoice.

Father, Thy sons before Thee
Discern with hallowed sight
Those holy, deep affections,
Expressing Thy delight
In Him, Thy Well-beloved,
Fulness of all Thou art,
Who, by His wondrous dying,
Revealed, O God, Thy heart.

J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), S.M.

We'll praise Thee, glorious Lord,
Who died to set us free;
No earthly songs can joy afford
Like heav'nly melody.
|2|
Love that no suff'ring stayed
We'll praise -- true love divine;
Love that for us atonement made,
Love that has made us Thine.
|3|
Love in Thy lonely life
Of sorrow here below;
Thy words of grace, with mercy rife,
Make grateful praises flow.
|4|
Love, that on death's dark vale
Its sweetest odours spread,
Where sin o'er all seemed to prevail,
Redemption's glory shed.
|5|
And now we see Thee ris'n,
Who once for us hast died,
Seated above the highest heav'n:
The Father's Glorified.
|6|
Jesus, we wait for Thee,
With Thee to have our part;
What can full joy and blessing be
But being where Thou art?
|7|
Soon wilt Thou take Thy throne,
Thy foes Thy footstool made,
And bring us with Thee as Thine own,
In glory love displayed.

O love divine! which had its source,
Our blessed God, in Thee alone;
When time had fully run its course,
Thy Son came forth to make it known.
|2|
Sent forth from Thee, Thy words to speak,

Anointed, to fulfil Thy will;
Thy Holy One, alone unique,
With great delight Thy heart did fill.

That fragrant life, in death's domain
Laid down, devoted to Thy will;
As Firstborn now He lives again,
With many sons Thy house to fill.

To have us holy, without blame
In Him, our blest and endless part.

Love's remembrance, Lord, Thou'rt seeking
From Thine own assembled thus;
For the bread we break is speaking
Of Thy body giv'n for us.
|2|
Holy vessel of God's pleasure
Was that body held by Thee;
Nothing but His will, Thy measure
From the manager to the tree.
|3|
Lord, we drink the cup of blessing,
The communion of Thy blood,
Thus as one our bond confessing
In the covenant of God.
|4|
¬Tis a testament deep founded,
Sealed for ever in Thy blood;
And its source is love unbounded
In the very heart of God.

J BEAUMONT, 6.6.8.4.6.6.8.4.

Our Shepherd is the Lord,
The living Lord who died;
With all His fulness can afford
We are supplied.
He richly feeds our souls
With blessings from above,
And leads us where the river rolls
Of endless love.
|2|
Our souls He doth restore,
And keeps us in His way;
He makes our cup of joy run o'er
From day to day.
Through love so full, so deep,
Anointed is our head;
Mercy and goodness us shall keep,
Where'er we tread.
|3|
When faith and hope shall cease,
And love abide alone,
Then shall we see Him face to face,
And know as known.
Still shall we lift our voice,
His praise our song shall be,
And we shall in His love rejoice
Who set us free.

Sing aloud to God, our strength!
He has brought us hitherto;
He will bring us home at length,
This the Lord our God will do.
Doubt not, for His word is stable;
Fear not, for His arm is able.
|2|
Sing aloud to God, our strength!
Sing with wonder of His love;
Who can tell its breadth and length,
Who below, or who above?
Who its depth and height can measure?
¬Tis a rich unbounded treasure.

Sing aloud to God, our strength!
He is with us where we go;
Fear we not the journey's length,
Fear we not the mighty foe;
All our foes shall be defeated,
All our journey safe completed.

Saviour, through the desert lead us,
Without Thee we cannot go;
Thou from cruel chains hast freed us,
And hast laid the tyrant low.
Let Thy presence
Cheer us all our journey through.

Through a desert waste and cheerless
Though our destined journey lie,
Rendered by Thy presence fearless,
We may every foe defy.
Nought shall move us
While we see Thee, Saviour, nigh.

With a price Thy love has bought us --
Saviour, what a love is Thine!
Hitherto Thy power has brought us:
Power and love in Thee combine.
Lord of glory,
Ever on Thy household shine!

J. RYLAND (1753-1825) Adapted, C.M.

O Lord, we would delight in Thee,
And on Thy care depend;
To Thee in every trouble flee,
Our safe unfailing Friend.

When human cisterns all are dried,
Thy fulness is the same;
May we with this be satisfied,
And glory in Thy Name.
|3|
No good in creatures can be found
All, all is found in Thee;
We must have all things and abound
Through Thy sufficiency.
|4|
Thou that hast made our hope secure
Wilt here all good provide;
While Thou art rich, can we be poor?
Thou who for us hast died!

O Lord, we cast each care on Thee,
And triumph and adore;
O that our great concern may be
To love and praise Thee more!

J. N. DARBY (1800-1882), C.M.

It is not with uncertain step
We tread our desert way;
A well-known voice has called us up
To everlasting day --
|2|
The voice of Him who here has trod
Alone the trackless way
(And marked the road which leads to God)
Where once we, lost, did stray.
|3|
He leaves us not alone to trace
Our path across the waste;
But leads us still, with living grace,
Homeward, whereto we haste.
|4|
See! open stands the heav'nly door,
Whence glory shines below,
To light the way He's gone before,
The coming bliss to show.
|5|
In patience then we tread the road --
Our faith and courage tried --
And trust the love which bears each load,
Our hearts from grief to hide.

To cast its darkest shadow
Across Thy holy mind,
We hear Thy voice, blest Saviour --
This do, remember Me!
With grateful hearts responding,
We do remember Thee.

We think of all the darkness
Which round Thy spirit pressed,
Of all those waves and billows
Which rolled across Thy breast;
O there Thy grace unbounded
And perfect love we see;
With thankful hearts, Lord Jesus,
We do remember Thee.
|3|
Till Thou shalt come in glory,
And call us hence away
To rest in all the brightness
Of that unclouded day,
We show Thy death, Lord Jesus,
And here would seek to be
More to Thy death conformed,
Whilst we remember Thee.

Father of glory! Thought beyond all thought!
In glory to His own blest likeness brought.

O Jesus, Lord, who loved us like to Thee?
Fruit of Thy work, with Thee, too, there to see
Thy glory, Lord, while endless ages roll,
Thy saints the prize and travail of Thy soul.

Yet it must be, Thy love had not its rest
Were Thy redeemed not with Thee fully blest;
That love that gives not as the world, but shares
All it possesses with its loved co-heirs.

Nor we alone, Thy loved ones all, complete,
In glory round Thee there with joy shall meet;
All like Thee, for Thy glory like Thee, Lord:
Object supreme of all, by all adored.

And in Thy perfect love rejoice,
Whose glory we shall share.

No more deferred our hope shall be,
No longer through a glass we'll see,
But clearly, face to face.
Then shall we dwell with Thee above,
Whom absent we have learned to love --
Blest trophies of Thy grace.

While waiting for Thee, Saviour, here,
O may Thy word our spirits cheer --
I quickly come again!
O may our hearts expect that day,
And to Thy word responsive say:
Come, Jesus, Lord, Amen!

The bread and cup, O Lord, recall
that sacrifice supreme, when all
The floods their voice did raise;
Their holy import we discern,
Thy suff'ring love afresh would learn,
Proved on that day of days.

All question of our moral stain
Thou didst resolve when Thou didst drain
That cup of bitt'rest woe:
So surely, that our hearts are free
To lose themselves adoringly
In love's eternal flow.

Borne in Thy heart through death's dark tide
(The travail Thine), with Thee we died,
In Thee we rise on high;
With hearts now filled with glory's light,
We tread our path through earth's dark night,
Where Thou our Lord didst die.

As holy Babe wast in a manger laid;
Yet did angelic hosts Thy title own,
And highest glory give to God alone.

Thy lowly pathway grace and truth displayed,
But wicked hands Thy brow with thorns arrayed;
Now glory-crowned, blest answer to Thy shame,
Thy saints with joy Thy worthiness acclaim.
|3|
To win Thy bride what depths of woe were Thine,
Scorned and betrayed, beset by powers malign!
Thy pierced hands, Thy riven side revealed
The strength of love that by Thy death was sealed.

Most blessed Lord, fain would we learn of Thee
To fill our part, yea, more like Thee to be;
With purpose fixed, Thy path our happy choice,
Thyself our all, until we hear Thy voice.

O God of grace, our Father,
We bless Thy holy Name;
We who enjoy Thy favour,
Made holy, without blame;
In love, which sought and found us,
And brought us nigh to Thee,
And won the rest of glory,
Our heav'nly home shall be.
|2|
Thy deep, eternal counsel
Chose us in Christ the Son,
Before the earth's foundation
Or time had yet begun;
That we might now the nearness
Of the Beloved know,
And, graced in all His fulness,
As sons our praises flow.
|3|
We worship Thee, our Father;
Soon all Thine own shall be
At home in heav'nly glory,
In love and joy with Thee.
We worship Thee, our Father,
And praise Thy perfect love;
Soon shall we chant Thy glory
In better strains above.

O God! we see Thee in the Lamb
To be our hope, our joy, our rest:
The glories that compose Thy Name
Standing engaged to make us blest.

Thou great and good! Thou just and wise!
Hail! as our Father now through grace;
For we are Thine by sacred ties,
Thy loved ones in the children's place.

Jesus, Lord, Thy grace has called us
From this barren world apart;
Thou with living bread dost feed us;
Thou our Lord and Teacher art.
|2|
Lord and Christ we gladly own Thee,
Every need by Thee supplied;
Good and faithful Shepherd, keep us,
By the flowing waters guide.

Subject to Thy Spirit's leading,
May our hearts respond to Thee;
In the holy shrine enquiring,
Grant us, Lord, Thy face to see.

Well known to us in present grace?
Well may our hearts rejoice!

With Thee in garments white,
Lord Jesus, we shall walk;
And, spotless in that heav'nly light,
Of all Thy suff'rings talk.
|3|
Close to Thy trusted side,
In fellowship divine;
No cloud, no distance, e'er shall hide
Glories that then shall shine.
|4|
Fruit of Thy boundless love,
That gave Thyself for us;
For ever we shall with Thee prove
That Thou still lovest thus.
|5|
And we love Thee, blest Lord,
E'en now, though feeble here;
Thy sorrow and Thy cross record
What makes us know Thee near.
|6|
We wait to see Thee, Lord;
Yet now within our hearts
Thou dwell'st in love that doth afford
The joy *that* love imparts.
|7|
*Yet* still we wait for Thee,
To see thee as Thou art;
Be with Thee, like Thee, Lord, and free
To love with all our heart.

Our God is light: and though we go
Across a trackless wild,
Jesus, Thy footsteps ever show
The path for every child.

At every step afresh we prove
How surely Thou dost guide,
In faithful and forbearing love
Which never turns aside.
|3|
Thou weariest not, most gracious Lord,
Though we may weary grow;
In season, the sustaining word
Thou giv'st our hearts to know.
|4|
Death's bitter waters met our thirst,
But Thou didst make them sweet;
Then on our gladdened vision burst
God's shady, cool retreat.

The manna and the springing well
Suffice for every need;
And Eshcol's grapes the story tell
Of where Thy path doth lead.

When I behold the wondrous cross
On which the Lord of glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.
|2|
Far be the thought that I should boast,
Save in the cross of Christ, my Lord;
All the vain things that charm me most,
I'd sacrifice them at His word.
|3|
There from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flowed mingled down;
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?
|4|
Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were an off'ring far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all!

And reign without a rival there!
From Thee, O Lord, we all receive;

How blest, how gracious in our eyes!
Care, anguish, sorrow, pass away,
And fear before Thy presence flies.
Lord Jesus, nothing would we see,
Nothing desire, apart from Thee.

Dwells in us now and doth reveal

Thyself our life to be.

Nor can the memory find
A sweeter sound than Thy blest Name,

To those who ask how kind Thou art,
How good to those who seek!

But what to those who find? Ah! this
Nor tongue nor pen can show;
The love of Jesus, what it is,
None but His loved ones know.

In Thee be all our glory now,
As through eternity.

Touched with a sympathy within,
He knows our feeble frame;
He knows what sorest trials mean,
For He has felt the same.

But spotless, undefiled and pure,
The great Redeemer stood,
While Satan's fiery darts He bore,
And did resist to blood.

He, in the days of sorrowing flesh,
Poured out His cries and tears,
And, though ascended feels afresh
What every member bears.

Then boldly let our faith address
The throne of grace and power;
We shall obtain delivering grace
In every needed hour.

In Satan's bondage held;

And make th¬ usurper yield.

The groaning earth to free:
And, as the glorious Son of man,
Himself its Lord to be.

And all creation shall rejoice
In Thy beloved Name.

At home in that which hated Thee,
But patient in Thy footsteps go,

We would -- and O confirm the power! --
With meekness meet the darkest hour,
By shame, contempt, however tried;
For Thou wast scorned and crucified.

We welcome still Thy faithful word --
The cross shall meet its sure reward;
For soon must pass the little while,
Then joy shall crown Thy servant's toil.
And we shall hear Thee, Saviour, say,
"Arise, my love, and come away";
We then shall grieve and weep no more,
But rest on heav'n's eternal shore.

And the word by God now uttered
To each weary soul is -- Come!
|2|
Come! -- the Father's house stands open,
With its love and light and song;
And returning to that Father,
All to you may now belong.
From sin's distant land of famine,
Toiling ¬neath the mid-day sun,
To a Father's house of plenty,
And a Father's welcome, Come!
|3|
Come! -- for night is gath'ring quickly
O'er this world's fast fleeting day;
If you linger till the darkness,
You will surely miss your way.
From the world and its delusion --
Now our voices rise as one,
While we give God's invitation;
Heav'n itself re-echoes -- Come!
{313}
H.D'A. CHAMPNEY, 10.10.10.10.
|1|
"Come unto Me -- and I will give you rest";
What blessed words to weary ones addressed!
They come from Him who knew the depth of woe,
And felt for sinners as none here below.
|2|
"Come unto Me," yes, come in all your sin!
Through Jesu's blood the vile may enter in,
May come to God who knows their guilt and need,
Assured the blood was shed for them indeed.
|3|
"Come unto Me," the blessed Son of God
Thus told on earth, in every step He trod,
The heart of Him who is in nature love,
And is inviting men that love to prove.
|4|
"Come unto Me," yes, God Himself says, Come!
He sees afar, and runs to welcome home
Unworthy sinners, who have nought to plead
But God's own love and their exceeding need.
|5|
"Come unto Me," O blessed open door!
For those who but for Christ had hoped no more;
O love of God! told out in full extent,
When Jesus to those depths of darkness went.
{314}
J. HART (1712-1768), 8.7.8.7.4.7.
|1|
Come, ye weary, heavy laden,
Open wide stands mercy's door;
Jesus ready waits to save you,
Full of pity, love and power:
He is able,
He is willing, doubt no more.
|2|
Let not conscience make you linger,
Nor of fitness fondly dream;
All the fitness He requireth
Is to feel your need of Him:
This He gives you,
¬Tis the Spirit's rising beam.
|3|
Come, ye weary, heavy laden,
Lost and ruined by the fall;
If you tarry till you're better,
You will never come at all:
Not the righteous,
Sinners Jesus came to call.
{315}
A CUTTING, 10.8.10.7.8.13.
|1|
Down from the glory came God's blessed Son,
Lost ones to save, lost ones to save;
Went into death and the victory won,
Triumphant rose from the grave --
Mighty to save! mighty to save!
Now in the glory He's able and willing to save.
|2|
Sin's bitter judgement He bore on the tree,
Dying to save, dying to save;
So that the sinner might justly go free,
His precious blood Jesus gave,
Sinners to save! sinners to save!
Now He is righteously able the guilty to save.
|3|
Sinner, God bids thee on Jesus believe,
Now while you may, now while you may;
Peace and salvation through Him you'll receive;
Do not, O do not delay!
Haste thee away! haste thee away!
Infinite love waits to welcome the sinner today.

Everlasting glory unto Jesus be!
Sing aloud the story of His victory!
How He left the splendour of His home on high,
Came in love so tender, on the cross to die.
|2|
Yes! He came from heaven, suffered in our stead;
Praise to Him be given, Firstborn from the dead!
Jesus, meek and lowly, came the lost to save;
He, the Victim holy, triumphed o'er the grave.

Christ is Lord of glory, sing we now today.
Tell abroad the story; own His rightful sway!
Sing aloud, and never cease to spread His fame;
Triumph, now and ever, in the Saviour's name.

I. FLEMING, 6.6.8.6.6.8.
|1|
God, from His throne on high,
Gave His own Son to die,
His only Son, in wondrous grace,
That sinners blest might be;
From Satan's power set free;
And dwell in love before His face.
|2|
From heav'n the Saviour came,
Jesus, His precious name,
The mighty One, of all things Lord;
Lost, sinful man to save,
To triumph o'er the grave,
And bring the wand'rer home to God.
|3|
He heals the sin-distrest;
The weary come for rest;
And old and young may learn His love.
To Him they gladly press,
He every one doth bless,
And one and all His goodness prove.
|4|
Then onward to the cross,
Through toil, and grief, and loss,
The Man of sorrows wends His way;
To sheathe the judgment sword,
The wrath He there endured,
And now is crowned in brightest day.
|5|
Come to Him, sinner, come!
Nor longer from Him roam;
Come as you are in all your sin;
Sad, guilty, helpless, lost,
Tried, troubled, tempest-tossed, --
By Christ, the door, now enter in.

MISS H. K. BURLINGHAM (1842-1901), 7.7.7.7.

God in mercy sent His Son
To a world by sin undone;
Jesus Christ was crucified,
¬Twas for sinners Jesus died.
|2|
O the glory of the grace,
Shining in the Saviour's face!
Telling sinners from above,
"God is light" and "God is love."
|3|
Sin and death no more shall reign,
Jesus died and lives again;
In the glory's highest height
See Him, God's supreme delight!
|4|
All who in His Name believe
Everlasting life receive;
Lord of all is Jesus now,
Every knee to Him must bow.
|5|
Christ the Lord will come again,
He who suffered once will reign;
Every tongue at last will bring
Tribute to the heav'nly King.

God is sending out the message
Of His wondrous love and grace,
Sends it from the highest glory,

Radiant in the Saviour's face.
O this precious light is telling
God's full favour now to man;
From the glory it is streaming --
Ne'er such news since time began!
|2|
God has full delight in Jesus,
Brightest glory He has won;
He has died, and through His dying
All God's pleasure will be done.
O what blessing in believing
In the One who came to die,
And the glorious light receiving
Of God's Son enthroned on high!
|3|
God has given all to Jesus,
All shall prosper in His hand;
Every knee shall bow to Jesus,
All obey God's own command.
Come, then, trust this peerless Saviour,
Prove the riches of His grace;
Live for ever in God's favour
As it shines in Jesus face!

Great God of wonders! all Thy ways
Are wondrous, matchless, and divine;
But the blest triumphs of Thy grace --
Most marvellous! -- unrivalled shine.
Who is a pardoning God like Thee?
Or who has grace so rich and free?
|2|
Sins of such horror to forgive,
Such guilty, daring ones to spare --
This is Thy grand prerogative,
And none can in that honour share.
Pardon, O God, is only Thine;
Mercy and grace are all divine.
|3|
In wonder lost, with trembling joy
We hail the pardon of our God;
Pardon for sins of deepest dye,
A pardon traced in Jesu's blood.
To pardon thus is Thine alone;
Mercy and grace are both Thine own.
|4|
Soon shall this strange, this wondrous grace,
This perfect miracle of love,
Fill the wide earth, while sweeter praise
Sounds its own note in heav'n above.
Who is a pardoning God like Thee?
Or who has grace so rich, so free?

Hark! hark! the voice of Christ, the sinner's Saviour,
In glory seated on His father's throne,
Telling of love and everlasting favour
For sinners far from God, by sin undone.
Message of Jesus, message of love,
Telling of welcome to that bright home above!
|2|
Blest words! they speak to us of God's salvation,
Worked out by Christ alone upon the cross,
Who by His blood redeems from every nation,
And saves His people from eternal loss.
Message of Jesus, message of love,
Telling of welcome to that bright home above!
|3|
Soon Jesu's voice of love may cease appealing,
And, to your loss, the door of mercy close;
Spurn not the voice of Him with heart so feeling,
Who proved His love by dying for His foes.
Message of Jesus, message of love,
Telling of welcome to that bright home above!

Hark! the voice of Jesus calling,
Come, ye laden, come to Me;
I have rest and peace to offer,
Rest, thou labouring one, for thee.
|2|
Yes, though high in heav'nly glory,
Still the Saviour calls to thee;
Faith can hear His gracious accents --
Come, ye laden, come to Me!
|3|
Life is found alone in Jesus,
Only there ¬tis offered thee;
Offered without price or money,
¬Tis the gift of God sent free.
|4|
Soon that voice will cease its calling;
Now it speaks, and speaks to thee;
Wilt thou heed the gracious message,
To the Lord for refuge flee?
{325}
C. DEAYTON, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
Hark to the message sounding
Out from the throne above,
Telling of grace abounding,
Telling of perfect love.
Hark to the wondrous story,
Redemption's price is paid;
Jesus is crowned with glory,
Both Lord and Christ is made.
|2|
None other name is given,
Jesus alone can save;
In love He came from heaven,
Himself a ransom gave.
In Him was grace abounding,
He paid in full the price;
O love immense, astounding,
O wondrous sacrifice!
|3|
The Spirit now bears witness
To Christ enthroned on high:
Redemption's work accomplished
By Him who came to die.
And now, in accents tender,
The Saviour speaks today;
Be wise, to Him surrender;
His gracious call obey!
{326}
H. P. WELLS, 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Hast thou heard God's wondrous message,
In His call of love to Thee?
Wouldst Thou turn from such entreaty,
Urged with gracious constancy?
|2|
Once, yea twice, He may have spoken,
As He waits Thy heart to win;

Waits to fill thy soul with gladness,
Free thee from thy load of sin.
|3|
Now He calls again -- O hearken!
He may never call thee more;
Wilt Thou, canst thou spurn the message,
And His patient grace ignore?

|4|
Turn thee now to Him, repenting;
Jesus as Thy Lord confess;
And, embracing Him as Saviour,
Joys untold thou shalt possess.

A. MIDLANE (1825-1909), 6.6.6.6.8.8.

Himself He could not save,
He on the cross must die,
Or mercy could not come
To ruined sinners nigh;
Yes, Jesu's precious blood must flow,
That sinners might forgiveness know.
|2|
Himself He could not save,
For justice must be done;
Our sins¬ full weight must fall
Upon the sinless One;
For nothing less could God accept
In payment of that fearful debt.
|3|
Himself He could not save,
For He the Surety stood
For all who now rely
Upon His precious blood;
He bore sin's penalty so dread,
When on the cross His blood was shed.
|4|
Himself He could not save,
Love's stream too deeply flowed;
In love Himself He gave,
To pay the debt we owed.
Obedience to His father's will
And love to Him did all fulfil.
|5|
And now exalted high,
A Prince and Saviour He,
That sinners might draw nigh
And drink of mercy free,
Of mercy now so richly shed,
For Jesus liveth who was dead.

R D EDWARDS, 11.11.11.11.

How sweet is the story of God's boundless love,
That brought His blest Son from the glory above!
Who died in our stead upon Calvary's tree,
Obtaining redemption that we might be free.
|2|
How wondrous the story! the claims of the throne
Were met by the blood which for guilt did atone;
The judgement of sin has been borne by the Son,
Who glorified God in the work He has done.
|3|
How brilliant the glory where Christ is enthroned!
How rightly His Name above others is owned!
Yes, Jesus the Saviour, the glory-crowned Lord,
Is worthy by all to be ever adored.
|4|
How great is the gift that the Father now gives
To him who obeys and on Jesus believes!
The Spirit, who filleth the heart with God's love,
Himself the blest Earnest of glory above.

L. H. FARRELL, 11.11.11.11.

How wondrous a Saviour is God's blessed Son!
How great and eternal the work He has done!
God's glory maintained by His death on the tree,
While mercy flows freely to you and to me.
|2|
How free is the pardon His blood has procured!
How blessed the welcome His Name has ensured
To all who confess Him their Saviour and Lord --
Now brought into favour, believing His word.
|3|
On Calvary see Him who died in our stead,
In glory behold Him exalted as Head;
God's wrath He endured on Calvary's tree,
By weakness and dying the Victor was He.
|4|
The Spirit has come from a glorified Lord,
Is given to those who obey God's own word;
Receiving this blessing, we live in God's love,
E'en now upon earth and for ever above.

I am not told to labour
To put away my sin;
So foolish, weak, and helpless,
I never could begin.

But blessed truth -- I know it --
Though ruined by the fall,
Christ for my soul hath suffered,
Yes, Christ has done it all!
|2|
And if I now would seek Him --
In love He sought for me,
When far from Him I wandered
In sin and misery;
He ope'd my ears, and gave me
To listen to His call;
He sought me, and He found me,
Yes, Christ has done it all!
|3|
And now I cannot please Him
In aught I say or do,
Unless He daily help me
His glory to pursue;
Still helpless and still feeble,
On His strong arm I fall,
My strength in pressing onward --
Yes, Christ must do it all!
|4|
And when in heav'nly glory
My ransomed soul shall be,
From sin and all pollution
For ever, ever free,
My soul shall then still praise Him,
And loud His grace extol --
Thou hast Thyself redeemed me;
Yes, Thou hast done it all!

I heard the voice of Jesus say,
Come unto me and rest;
Lay down, thou weary one, lay down
Thy head upon My breast.
I came to Jesus as I was,
Weary, and worn, and sad;
I found in Him a resting place,
And He has made me glad.
|2|
I heard the voice of Jesus say,
Behold, I freely give
The living water -- thirsty one,
Stoop down, and drink, and live.
I came to Jesus, and I drank
Of that life-giving stream;
My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,
And now I live in Him.
|3|
I heard the voice of Jesus say,
I am this dark world's Light;
Look unto Me: Thy morn shall rise
And all Thy day be bright.
I looked to Jesus, and I found
In Him my Star, my Sun;
And in that light of life I'll walk
Till travelling days are done.

I love to sing of Jesus,
The story all so true,
To me most sweet and precious,
The old but ever new.
He came from brightest glory,
From radiant courts on high;
How matchless is the story
Of Him who came to die!
|2|
¬Twas there my Saviour suffered,
And tasted death for me;
Yes, there the work He finished,
That sets me ever free --
My sins all laid upon Him,
The wrath and judgment borne,
The power of Satan broken,
In Jesu's death of scorn.
|3|
And now the Lord is risen,
His pain and travail o'er;
Seated in highest heaven
Alive, to die no more.
And by the Holy Spirit
He gives me, here below,
Rich blessings to inherit,
The love of God to know.
|4|
¬Tis life and wondrous favour
To live e'en now to God
Through Him, the glorious Saviour
Who shed His precious blood;
And soon He's coming for me,
To take me home above,
Where still I'll sing the story
Of Jesus and His love.

Would of Thy love, in all its breadth and length,
Its height and depth and everlasting strength,
Know more and more.

It passeth telling! that blest love of Thine,
Lord Jesus! Saviour! yet these lips of mine
Would fain proclaim to sinners far and near
A love which can remove all guilty fear,
And love beget.

It passeth praises! that great love of Thine,
Lord Jesus! Saviour! yet this heart of mine
Would sing a love so rich, so full, so free,
Which brought a rebel sinner, like to me,
Nigh unto God.

O fill me, Jesus Saviour, with Thy love;
Lead, lead me to the living fount above!
Thither may I in simple faith draw nigh,
And never to another fountain fly,
But unto Thee.

When on Thy lofty throne we sit with Thee,
Then of Thy love in all its breadth and length,

Those ties which nought can sever;
For I am His and He is mine
For ever and for ever.

I've found a Friend, O such a Friend!
He died, He bled to save me;
And not alone the gift of life,
But His own self He gave me.
Nought that I have mine own I call,

My heart, my strength, my life, my all
Are His, and His for ever.

I've found a Friend, O such a Friend,
So kind, and true, and tender!
So wise a Counsellor and Guide,
So mighty a Defender!

Shall life or death, shall earth or hell?
No! I am His for ever.

And is from guilt set free;
¬Tis music in his ears,
¬Tis life and victory;

And songs of praise his lips employ.

We sing Thy blessed Name,
We sing Thy dying love,
Thy rising power proclaim:
But soon, to give Thee worthy praise,
Both heav'n and earth their songs shall raise.

He is able, willing, waiting now to save;
Simply trust Him, that is all.

Though your wayward feet have wandered far,
And you're deeply sunk in sin,
Yet in patient grace now the Saviour waits
Your weary heart to win.

Though His gracious call you have oft refused,
And He's sought your trust in vain,
Yet with love unchanged by cold neglect
He is seeking you again.

O surrender now, yield to love divine,
Jesus lingers for you still;
While in grace He says, "Come unto me,"
Let your answer be, I will!

Each hour receiving grace on grace,
Until I see Thee face to face.

Because Thy work is done.

For Thou hast brought again to Him
More than by man He lost;
And in the very place of sin
We see His glory most.

In concert with the heav'ns above
We crown Thee with our praise.

A Sacrifice of nobler name
And richer blood than they.

When hanging on th¬ accused tree
For all our guilt was there.

And sing redeeming love.

Our ruined souls to save.

No more in dread of wrath,

To be in God's favour, believe on the Son!
Christ's death has secured salvation so free;
The cross He endured for you and for me.

From heaven descending His own to receive.
O sinner, confess Him, the throne-seated Lord;
And thou shalt be with Him where He is adored.
{347}
ELIZA REED, L.M.
|1|
O do not let the word depart,
And close Thine eyes against the light!
Poor sinner, harden not thine heart;
Thou wouldst be saved? Why not to-night?
|2|
To-morrow's sun may never rise
Upon thy long deluded sight;
This is the time, O then be wise:
Thou wouldst be saved? Why not to-night?
|3|
Our God in pity lingers still,
And wilt thou thus His love requite?
Renounce at once thy stubborn will
Thou wouldst be saved? Why not to-night?
|4|
This world has nothing new to give
It has no true, no pure delight
Look now to Jesus Christ, and live:
Thou wouldst be saved? Why not to-night?
{348}
G CUTTING AND A MACE (1843-1934), C.M.
|1|
O gracious Saviour, Thou hast giv'n
My trembling soul to know
That, trusting in Thy precious blood,
I'm washed as white as snow.
|2|
Since Thou hast borne sin's heavy load,
My guilty fear is o'er;
Made Thine, by virtue of Thy blood,
I'm sealed for evermore.
|3|
What wait I for, most blessed Lord,
Except Thy face to see?
The Spirit is the Earnest giv'n,
What must Thy presence be?
|4|
To hear Thy voice, to see Thy face,
And grieve Thy heart no more;
But drink the fulness of Thy grace,
Thy love for evermore.
{349}
A. J. H. BROWN, 10.10.10.6.
|1|
O Jesus, Lord, Thou stoodest in my stead;

God's holy wrath was poured upon Thy head;
For me Thou once wast numbered with the dead --
For me, O Lord, for me.
|2|
O Jesus, Lord, Thy blood has brought me nigh,
Has cleansed me from my sins of scarlet dye;
For me Thy blood was shed on Calvary --
For me, O Lord, for me.
|3|
O Jesus, Lord, unchanging is Thy love,
Thou liv'st for me at God's right hand above;
Thy tender care for me I daily prove --
For me, O Lord, for me.
|4|
For me, O Lord, Thou hast done all things well;
Though feebly here, Thy praise my voice shall swell --
When with Thee, Lord, I shall for ever dwell --
With Thee, O Lord, with Thee.
|5|
O Jesus, Lord, in Thee may I confide,
In Thee in every storm and trouble hide,
And trust in Thee whatever, Lord, betide --
In Thee, O Lord, in Thee.
{350}
MRS. A. R. C. COUSIN (1824-1906) Adapted, 8.6.8.6.8.6.
|1|
O Lord, what burdens Thou didst bear!
Our load was laid on Thee;
Thou stoodest for the sinner there
To bear all ill for me.
A Victim led, Thy blood was shed;
Now there's no load for me.
|2|
Death and the curse were in our cup,
O Lord, ¬twas full for Thee!
But Thou hast drained the last dark drop,
¬Tis empty now for me.
That bitter cup -- love drank it up;
Left but the love for me.
|3|
The tempest's awful voice was heard:
O Lord, it broke on Thee!
Thine open bosom was my ward,
It bore the storm for me.
Thy form was scarred, thy visage marred;
Now cloudless peace for me.
|4|
For me, Lord Jesus, Thou hast died,
And I have died with Thee;
Thou'rt ris'n: my bands are all untied;
And now Thou liv'st in me.
The Father's face in radiant grace
Shines now in light on me.
{351}
H.D'A. CHAMPNEY, 10.10.10.2.
|1|
O Lord, what love to sinners Thou hast shown,
To give Thy life for those by sin undone!
But is that blood which doth for sins atone,
For me?
|2|
Was it for guilty sinners such as I
That Thou, O Lord, didst suffer here and die?
And is that grace which Thou dost now supply
For me?
|3|
Is it for me, who early went astray,
Who turned from God to tread a self-willed way,
Is it for me that mercy flows today?
For me?
|4|
If it's the hopeless case Thou lov'st to meet,
If it's a sinner thou dost run to greet,
Then ¬tis for me to worship at Thy feet --
For me.
|5|
Yes, ¬twas for me, Lord Jesus, Thou didst come;
To me Thou givest pardon, peace, and home;
And, Saviour, in Thy loving heart there's room
For me.
{352}
MRS J. A. TRENCH, 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
O the brightness of the glory
Shining in the Saviour's face!
Telling all the blessed story
Of the ways of God in grace:
Lowly, hated, and rejected,
In the world He came to save;
By the glory of the Father
Raised triumphant from the grave.
|2|
Now we see Him crowned with glory,
Glory in His unveiled face,
And in peace and rest before him,
In that glory learn of grace:
For it shineth in the visage
Of the One who for us died,
Bore our sins and all their judgement --
Jesus Christ the crucified.
{353}

R. D. EDWARDS, 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.7.7.
|1|
O the love of God is boundless,
Perfect, causeless, full and free!
Doubts have vanished, fears are groundless,
Now I know that love to me.
Love, the source of all my blessing,
Love that set itself on me;
Love that gave the spotless Victim,
Love told out at Calvary.
¬Tis love displayed by Jesus,
When alone at Calvary.
|2|
O the cross of Christ is wondrous!
There I learn God's heart to me;
Midst the silent deep'ning darkness,
"God is light" I also see.

Holy claims of justice finding
Full expression in that scene,
Light and love alike are telling
What yon woe and suff'rings mean.
My guilt was borne by Jesus
When in darkness on the tree.
|3|
O the sight in heav'n is glorious!
Man in righteousness is there;
Once the Victim, now victorious,
Jesus lives in glory fair!

Him, who met the claims of glory
And the need of ruined man
On the cross -- O wondrous story! --
God has set at His right hand.
How rightly crowned is Jesus,
He who once atonement made!
{354}
A. P. CECIL (1841-1889), 8.7.8.7.
|1|
O the peace for ever flowing
From God's thoughts of His own Son,
O the peace of simply knowing,
On the cross that all was done.
|2|
Peace with God -- for Christ in heaven
Object is of faith to me:
Peace with God -- the Lord is risen,
Righteousness now counts me free.
|3|
Peace with God -- for Christ's in glory;
God is just and God is love;
O how blessed is the story,
That we're brought to God above!
|4|
Jesus, Saviour, we adore Thee,
Christ of God, anointed One!
We confess Thee Lord of glory,
Fruits of vict'ry Thou hast won.
{355}
A. MIDLANE (1825-1909), 10.10.10.10. DACTYLIC
|1|
O what a Saviour is Jesus the Lord!
Well may His Name by His saints be adored!
He has redeemed them from hell by His blood,
Saved them for ever, and brought them to God.
|2|
Now in the glory He waits to impart
Peace to the conscience, and joy to the heart;
Waits to be gracious, to pardon and heal
All who their sin and their wretchedness feel.
|3|
Thousands have fled to His spear-pierced side;
Welcome they all have been, none are denied;
Weary and laden, they all have been blest;
Joyfully now in the Saviour they rest.
{356}
W. COWPER (1731-1800) Adapted, C.M.
|1|
Of all the Gifts Thy love bestows,
Thou Giver of all good!
E'en heav'n itself no richer knows
Than the Redeemer's blood
|2|
Faith, too, that trusts the blood through grace,
From that same love we gain;
Else, sweetly as it suits our case,
The gift had been in vain.
|3|
We praise Thee, and would praise Thee more;
To Thee our all we owe;
The precious Saviour, and the power
That makes Him precious too.
{357}
MISS H. K. BURLINGHAM (1842-1901), 8.7.8.7.4.7.
|1|
On His Father's throne is seated
Christ the Lord, the Living One,
All His toil on earth completed,
All His work for sinners done;
In the glory
See Him, God's beloved Son.
|2|
Man the cross to him awarded,
Man the Saviour crucified;
This worlds judgment stands recorded,
God's own nature glorified.
By the glory
Christ was claimed, on earth who died.
|3|
Every knee shall bow before Him,
Every tongue confess His Name;
Ransomed myriads shall adore Him
Who endured the sinner's shame.
From the glory
God doth now His worth proclaim.
{358}
J. A. V. POSECK (1816-1896), 8.7.8.7.

|1|
On the Lamb our souls are resting,
What His love no tongue can say;
All our sins, so great, so many,
In His blood are washed away.
|2|
Sweetest rest and peace have filled us,
Sweeter praise than tongue can tell;
God is satisfied with Jesus,
We are satisfied as well.
|3|
Conscience now no more condemns us,
For His own most precious blood
Once for all has washed and cleansed us,
Cleansed us in the eyes of God.
|4|
Filled with this sweet peace for ever,
On we go, through strife and care,

Till we find that peace around us
In the Lamb's high glory there.
|5|
On the living Lord believing,
We have righteousness and peace.
By the Holy Spirit given:
Fadeless joys that never cease.
{359}
A. G. DOUGHTY, 8.7.8.7.4.7.
|1|
Once from glory's height descending,
To this earth the Saviour came;
Here in grace His pathway wending,
Here He magnified God's name.
Lowly Saviour!
We would still His grace proclaim.
|2|
On to Calv'ry's shame and suff'ring,
He to death the path did tread;
There for sin the perfect Off'ring,
On the cross His blood was shed.
Wondrous Saviour!
Dying in the sinner's stead.
|3|
Out from death, His work completed,
Burst the portals of the grave;
High at God's right hand now seated,
He can e'en the vilest save.

Glorious Saviour!
¬Twas in love His all He gave.
|4|
Still he waits in grace transcending,
He for thee has tarried long;
Bids thee share in joys unending,
Join e'en now in heav'n's blest song.
Worthy Saviour!
Theme of all the ransomed throng.
{360}
T. KELLY (1769-1855), L.M.
|1|
Ours is a pardon bought with blood,
Amazing truth! the blood of One
Who, without usurpation, could
Lay claim to heav'n's eternal throne!
|2|
No victim of inferior worth
Could bear the stroke that justice aimed;
For none but He, in heav'n or earth,
Could offer that which justice claimed.
|3|
But He, the Lord of glory, came;
Upon the cross He bowed His head;
He suffered pain, He suffered shame,
And lay a prisoner with the dead.
|4|
But lo! He's risen from the grave,
And bears the greatest, noblest Name:
The Lord -- almighty now to save
From sin, from death, from endless shame.
{361}
E. E. NICHOLS, 8.5.8.3.
|1|
Precious Name! the Name of Jesus,
Son of God most high,
Who in love to guilty sinners
Came to die.
|2|
Precious Name! the story telling
Of His humble birth;
Of His lonely pathway, trodden
Here on earth.
|3|
Precious Name of Him the Saviour,
Come the lost to save;
In His grace, for ruined sinners
All He gave.

|4|
Precious Name of Him who suffered
On the shameful tree,
Gave Himself, the willing Victim,
Spotless He.
|5|
Precious Name! enthroned in heaven,
Still that Name He bears;
On His brow the crown of glory
Now He wears.
|6|
Precious, peerless Name of Jesus,
None can tell its worth;
Sweetest Name there is in heaven,
Or on earth.
{362}
MISS F. R. HAVERGAL (1836-1879), 8.5.8.3.
|1|
Precious, precious blood of Jesus,
Shed on Calvary!
Shed for rebels, shed for sinners,
Shed for me.
|2|
Precious, precious blood of Jesus!
All the price is paid;
Perfect pardon now is offered,
Peace is made.
|3|
Precious, precious blood of Jesus,
Jesus, God's own Son!
Telling that the work is finished;
All is done.
|4|
Thought Thy sins are red like crimson,
Deep in scarlet glow,
Jesu's precious blood can make them
White as snow.
|5|
Precious blood, whose full atonement
Bringeth us to God!
Precious blood, our song and glory,
Praise and laud!
{363}
J DENHAM SMITH (1816-1889), 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Rise, my soul! behold ¬tis Jesus,
Jesus fills thy wond'ring eyes;
See Him now in glory seated,
Where thy sins can no more rise.
|2|
All thy sins were laid upon Him,
Jesus bore them on the tree;
God, who knew them, laid them on Him,
And, believing, thou art free.
|3|
God now brings thee to His dwelling,
Spreads for thee His feast divine,
Bids thee welcome, ever telling
What a portion there is thine.
|4|
Blessed, glorious word, "for ever,"
Yea, "for ever" is the word;
Nothing can the ransomed sever,
Nought divide them from the Lord.
{364}
A. M. TOPLADY (1740-1778), 7.7.7.7.7.7.
|1|
Rock of Ages! cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy riven side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Cleansing from its guilt and power.

|2|
Not the labour of my hands
Could fulfil the law's demands;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears for ever flow,
Nought for sins could e'er atone
But Thy blood, and Thine alone.
|3|
Nothing in my hand I bring,

Simply to Thyself I cling;
Naked, come to Thee for dress;
Helpless, look to Thee for grace;
Foul, I to the fountain fly;
Wash me, Saviour, or I die.
|4|
Found by Thee before I sought,
Unto Thee in mercy brought;
I have Thee for righteousness,
From Thy fulness grace on grace;
Thou hast washed me in Thy blood,
Made me live and live to God.
{365}
T H REYNOLDS, 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
Saved for glory! yes, for glory,
By the work of God's blest Son;
Saved for glory, wondrous story,
We believe what Christ has done.
Saved for glory, saved by Jesus,
All our meetness His alone;
Meetness which the Father pleases
Ours should be, in Christ the Son.
|2|
All of grace, yes, grace surpassing,
Such a portion to bestow;
But the love all knowledge passing,
Grace has called us now to know;
Love that bore the stripes and sorrow,
Love that suffered on the tree,
Love that shares the glorious morrow
With the loved ones, you and me.
|3|
Through that perfect Off'ring, never
Can our sins against us rise;
Perfected are we for ever
By that wondrous sacrifice.
Jesus, Saviour! we are graven
Ever on Thy heart of love;
We shall reach the wished-for haven
In Thy Father's house above.
{366}
R. SANDEMAN, L.M.
|1|
See mercy, mercy from on high,
Descend to rebels doomed to die;
¬Tis mercy free, which knows no bound;

How sweet, how pleasant is the sound!
|2|
Soon as the reign of sin began,
The light of mercy dawned on man,
When God announced the blessed news,
The woman's Seed thy head shall bruise.
|3|
Brightly it beamed on men forlorn,
When Christ, the holy Child was born;
And brighter still in splendour shone
When Jesus, dying, cried, ¬Tis done!
|4|
Complete in power when He arose
And burst the bands of all His foes;
He captive led captivity,
And took for us His seat on high.
{367}
T. KELLY (1769-1855), 8.7.8.7.8.7.8.7.
|1|
Stricken, smitten and afflicted,
See Him dying on the tree;
¬Tis the Christ by man rejected;
Yes, my soul, ¬tis He, ¬tis He!
Mark the Sacrifice appointed,
See who bears the awful load!
¬Tis the Word, ¬tis God's Anointed,
Son of man and Son of God.
|2|
Here we have a firm foundation,
Here the refuge of the lost;
Christ, the Rock of our salvation,
His the Name of which we boast.
Lamb of God! for sinners wounded,
Sacrifice to cancel guilt,
None shall ever be confounded
Who on Thee their hope have built.
{368}
MISS K M BURLINGHAM (1842-1901), 6.6.8.4.6.6.8.4.
|1|
The Father sent the Son
A ruined world to save;
Man meted to the sinless One
The cross -- the grave.
Blest Substitute from God,
Wrath's awful cup He drained;
Laid down His life, and e'en the tomb's
Reproach sustained.
|2|
Earth shuddered as He died,
God's well-beloved Son;
The darkness sought His woes to hide;
His work is done.
He lives to die no more,
Joy dwells upon His brow;
His agonies untold are o'er,
He triumphs now!
|3|
The new and living way
Stands open now to heav'n;
Thence where the blood is seen alway,
God's gift is giv'n.
The river of His grace,
Through righteousness supplied,
Is flowing o'er the barren place
Where Jesus died.
|4|
The Lord shall come again;
The Conqueror must reign.
No tongue but shall confess Him then,
The Lamb once slain.
Jesus is worthy now
All homage to receive;
Worthy that all to Him should bow,
The truth believe.
{369}
ANONYMOUS, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
The Lord who healed the leper
Is looking on thee now;
And, though Thy case discerning,
No frown is on His brow.
Not all Thy sins dark story
Has turned away His love;
¬Twas need like thine that brought Him
Down from His throne above.
|2|
The Lord who touched the leper
In His amazing grace,
Though ever pure and holy,
Once took the sinner's place!
His grace and perfect goodness
In all His actions shine;
His cross at length expressing
Both light and love divine.
|3|
The Lord who cleansed the leper
Can surely make thee clean;
His blood can cleanse the vilest,
Whate'er his guilt has been.
O doubt not, He is willing,
But take Him at His word,
Without the "If" exclaiming,
"Thou wilt, Thou canst, O Lord!"
{370}
A. MIDLANE (1825-1909), L.M.
|1|
The perfect righteousness of God
Is witnessed in the Saviour's blood;
¬Tis in the cross of Christ we trace
His righteousness, yet wondrous grace.
|2|
God could not pass the sinner by,

Justice demands that He should die;
But in the cross of Christ we see
How God can save, yet righteous be.
|3|
The judgment fell on Jesu's head,
¬Twas in His blood sin's debt was paid;
Stern justice can demand no more,
And mercy can dispense her store.
|4|
The sinner who believes is free,
Can say, the Saviour died for me;
Can point to the atoning blood
And say, This made my peace with God.
{371}
MRS MARY WALKER (1816-1878), 8.8.8.6.
|1|
The wanderer no more will roam,
The lost one to the fold is come,
The prodigal is welcomed home,
O Lamb of God, through Thee!
|2|
The Holy Spirit, too, has wrought
Within the soul to God now brought,
Love finding thus the joy it sought,
O Lamb of God, through Thee!
|3|
It is the Father's joy to bless;
His love has found for me a dress,
A robe of spotless righteousness,
O Lamb of God, in Thee!
|4|
Yea, in the fulness of His grace,
God put me in the children's place,
Where I may gaze upon His face,
O Lamb of God, in Thee!
|5|
Not half His love can I express,
Yet, Lord, with joy my lips confess,
This blessed portion I possess,
O Lamb of God, in Thee!
|6|
Thy precious Name it is I bear,
In Thee I am to God brought near,
And all the Father's love I share,
O Lamb of God, in Thee!
{372}
C. DEAYTON, 7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6.
|1|
There is a wondrous story,
That often has been told,
So full of grace and glory,
So new and yet so old.
And now again we tell it,
So rich, so full, so free;
And hosts unnumbered swell it
Throughout eternity.
|2|
He who was rich in glory
Came down to earth below
In love, O wondrous story!
To lowest depths did go.
Jesus, the spotless Victim,
Died there upon the tree,
That we might know God's favour,
From judgment ever free.
|3|
How dark that night of sorrow
Through which the Saviour passed!
And deep the stormy waters,
And fierce the tempest blast!
But O the mighty Saviour,
Victorious o'er the grave,
Has ris'n in glorious power,
And lives the lost to save.
|4|
The darkness all is ended,
That night for ever past;
To God's right hand ascended,
He'll come again at last,
To call His ransomed people
To yonder glory bright --
Made like to His own image,
To dwell with Him in light.
{373}
ANONYMOUS, L.M.
|1|
There is no other Name than Thine,
Jehovah-Jesus! Name divine;
On which to rest for sins forgiv'n,
For peace with God, for hope of heav'n.
|2|
Name above every name, Thy praise
Shall fill yon courts through endless days;
Jehovah-Jesus! Name divine,
Rock of salvation-Thou art mine!
{374}
T. KELLY (1769-1855), 8.8.6.8.8.6.
|1|
Though all the beasts on earth be slain
To wash away sin's crimson stain,
Though all their blood should flow,
The sacrifice would be in vain,
Iniquity would still remain:
Sin is not cancelled so.
|2|
A better sacrifice than these
It needs, the conscience to appease,
Or satisfy the Lord;
No blood hath virtue to atone
For man's offence, but His alone
Whose title is the Word:
|3|
His, who could say, Himself the Son,
'My Father and Myself are One',
Who made the world around:
His, who Jehovah's Fellow stood,
And claimed equality with God,
Whose glory knows no bound.
|4|
Jesus the Christ, on earth His Name,
He came -- in love to sinners came --
And bowed His head and died;
A full atonement now is made,
The ransom by Himself is paid,
And justice satisfied.
|5|
That sinners might draw near to Him,
God planned this great, this gracious scheme,
And found the ransom too.
Let all His saints their voices raise,
And sing the great Redeemer's praise

While endless ages flow.
{375}
W. YERBURY, 7.7.8.7.7.7.8.7.
|1|
Thy Name we love, Lord Jesus;
It tells God's love unbounded
To ruined man, ere time began,
Or heav'n and earth were founded.
Thine is a love eternal,
That found in us its pleasure,
That brought Thee low to bear our woe,
And make us Thine own treasure.
|2|
Thy Name we love, Lord Jesus;
It tells Thy birth so lowly,
Thy patience, grace, Thy gentleness,
Thy lonely path, so holy.
Thou wast the Man of sorrows,

Our grief, too, Thou didst bear it;
The bitter cup Thou drankest up,
The thorny crown, didst wear it.
|3|
Thy Name we love, Lord Jesus;
God's Lamb, Thou was ordained;
For us undone, Thou spotless One,
Our judgement hast sustained.
We see Thee crowned in glory,
Above the heav'ns now seated,
The vict'ry won, Thy work well done,
Our righteousness completed.
{376}
A. P. CECIL (1841-1889), 8.7.8.7.
|1|
Trembling soul, behold Thy Saviour,
Seated on the father's throne;
Object of God's highest favour,
See Him, God's beloved Son!
|2|
Once on earth in Bethlehem's manger,
As a holy Babe, He lay;
God come down, a heav'nly Stranger,
Love to sinners to display.
|3|
Sinner, see thy God beside thee,
In a servant's form come near,
Sitting, walking, talking with thee!

Sinai's mount no longer fear.
|4|
Onward still to Calv'ry moving,
Onward still He treads His way,
God the Father's will fulfilling,
Love to sinners to display.
|5|
Hearken to the wondrous story --
Jesus died and rose for thee;
God in heav'n now waits to save thee,
And, believing, thou art free.
{377}
H.D'A. CHAMPNEY, 8.6.8.4.
|1|
¬Twas not for our great love to Thee
That Thou didst send Thy Son;
That spring of love, O God, we see
In Thee alone.
|2|
What love, Lord Jesus, brought Thee down
Our hardened hearts to win,
To be despised and spit upon,
And bear our sin!
|3|
The sins of many Thou didst bear,
Of all who look to Thee,
When God, Thy God, forsook Thee there,
On Calv'ry's tree.
|4|
"'Tis finished!" loud triumphant cry
Ere Thou didst yield Thy breath!
The veil was rent, and God draws nigh
To us, through death.
|5|
That glorious resurrection morn
Bids doubts for ever cease;
For far and wide the news is borne
Of perfect peace.
|6|
Yes. peace! since every claim is met,

Lord Jesus, by Thy blood,
And Thou, our peace, art ris'n, and set
On high by God.
|7|
Thy grace, O Lord, alone revealed
That wondrous heart of Thine;
We thank Thee, and ourselves we yield
To love divine.
{378}
H. BONAR (1808-1889), S.M.
|1|
We hear the words of love,
We gaze upon the blood,
We see the mighty Sacrifice,
And we have peace with God.
|2|
¬Tis everlasting peace,
Sure as Jehovah's Name;
¬Tis stable as His steadfast throne,
For evermore the same.
|3|

Our love is oft-times low,
Our joy still ebbs and flows;
But peace with Him remains the same;
No change Jehovah knows.
|4|
We change -- He changes not,
Though changing years roll by;
His love, not ours, the resting-place,
We on His truth rely.
|5|
The cross still stands unchanged,
Though heav'n is now His home;
The mighty stone is rolled away,
For He has left the tomb.
|6|
We know He liveth now
At God's right hand above;
We know the throne on which He sits,
We know His truth and love.
{379}
A. MIDLANE (1825-1909) Adapted, 8.8.8.8.

We speak of the grace of our God,
So boundless, so rich, and so free;
But what will it profit Thy soul
Unless ¬tis relied on by thee?

We speak of salvation and love,
By the Father in Jesus made known;
But, if thou wouldst live unto God,
By faith thou must make it thine own.
|3|
We speak of the Saviour's great Name,
By which God can sinners receive;
Yet still art thou lost and undone
Unless in that Name thou'lt believe.
|4|
We speak of the blood of the lamb,
Which frees from pollution and sin;
But its virtues by thee must be proved,
Or thou wilt be ever unclean.
|5|
We speak of the glory to come,
Of the heavens so bright and so fair;
But, unless thou'lt in Jesus believe,
Thou wilt not, thou canst not be there.
{380}
G. V. WIGRAM (1805-1879), C.M.
|1|
Well may we sing, with triumph sing,
The great Redeemer's praise,
The glories of the living God,
Revealed in Jesu's face!
|2|
The love of God it was that sought
From sin to set us free;
That gave the Son, whose precious blood
Has wrought our liberty.
|3|
In Him we read the Father's love,
And find eternal peace;
We meet in Him a Saviour God,
And fear and terror cease.
|4|
Then gladly sing and sound abroad
The great Redeemer's praise,
The glories of the living God,
The riches of His grace!
{381}
H. WREFORD, 8.5.8.3.
|1|
Wilt Thou come, or wilt thou linger?
¬Tis the Saviour calls;
Death and darkness are around thee;
Sin enthralls.
|2|
Thou may'st come; the vilest sinner
May in Christ confide.
Thou art welcome, for to save thee
Jesus died.
|3|
See the blood, and hear Him speaking
Of redemption done;
And on glory's heights behold Him,
God's own Son.
|4|
Hear Him speak the word of pardon;
Trust in Him who died;
And thy heart shall lose its burden,
By His side.
{382}
H. P. WELLS, 8.5.8.3.
|1|
Wilt Thou yield to love's entreaty?
Canst Thou turn away
From the God who marks Thy goings
Every day?
|2|
Dost Thou feel that Thou hast wandered,
And ignored His love?
Listen to the wondrous message
From above.
|3|

From sin's burden He would free Thee,
Satisfy Thy heart;
And with love's embrace receive thee,
As thou art.
|4|
No reproach, no condemnation,
Does He hold for Thee;
Grace has met the claims of justice
Righteously.
|5|
When thy journey all is over,
Thou with Christ above
Shalt for ever be a trophy
Of His love.
