NOTES OF A READING @1 CHRONICLES 4
@1 Chronicles 4: 9, 10, 21 - 23
C.A.C. I was thinking that in chapter 2 the government of God is seen in a serious aspect in respect of those who are set in a position of privilege in Israel. In verse 3 we get Er, and in verse 7 Achar, who is spoken of as "the troubler of Israel". I think we see in these two instances the government of God acting in severity in regard to those in a place of privilege; so these cases become a serious warning to us.
Ques. Would you say one was on the moral side and the other on the religious?
C.A.C. They were both wicked men mentioned to bring home to us that what is wrong in the sight of God will never be passed over in those who are in a place of privilege.
Rem. "You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore will I visit upon you all your iniquities" (@Amos 3: 2).
C.A.C. God never overlooks evil with its resulting punishment in those positionally near Him. So if we name the name of the Lord we must withdraw from iniquity. If we do not, we shall partake of its judgment.
Ques. Is that seen with the Corinthians? They are disciplined. Is it not to save us from being condemned with the world?
C.A.C. Yes, surely, and God calls His people to come out of Babylon, not to have fellowship with her sins and partake of her plagues. God is sure to judge what is, wrong, and if christians do not separate from what is
{4}
wrong they are sure to partake of its judgment. Achar brings in another principle. He is called "the troubler of Israel". These instances have to do with the fellowship. Achar committed all Israel to iniquity. Though one man sinned, all were committed to it; such was the unity of Israel. That should make us very careful for we take all the brethren with us wherever we go. A young brother lying in his bunk on board ship the first night of his voyage thought to himself, I may not see a believer for two years, but how I behave myself on this ship will affect the universal fellowship of God's people throughout the world. That was not bad for a young lad, was it?
Rem. In @Joshua 7 the whole of Israel was involved.
Rem. The whole point as to Achar was that no one knew it but God.
C.A.C. And they could not meet their enemies; and if we do not leave what is wrong it is a serious matter. If they sinned they lost all their power, and our power lies largely in our separation from all that is wrong. The brethren all suffer, even if they do not know of it. These are great principles brought out for the returned remnant and therefore to be pondered carefully; they are full of instruction for us.
Then we get in chapter 2 the introduction of Christ.
Ques. You refer to "David the seventh"?
C.A.C. Yes, David is Christ, and the Spirit just introduces him, he is just mentioned.
Ques. Why is David the seventh in Chronicles and the eighth in Samuel? Is it there in contrast to Saul that he is the eighth -- the man after God's own heart -- while here it is spiritual?
C.A.C. Yes, here it is perfection, the seventh, not exactly after a new order; and the Spirit of God is delighted when He can bring in Christ and give Him a footing in our hearts. His greatness and glories are all
{5}
developed later in the book, but here He is just introduced.
When Paul is writing to the Romans he begins, "God's glad tidings ... concerning his Son (come of David's seed according to flesh, marked out Son of God in power ... )". Well, he can build the whole epistle, the whole gospel and counsel of God upon that; the moment we have Christ, we have everything!
Rem. "In him is the yea, and in him the amen"; (@2 Corinthians 1: 20) finality is in Christ.
C.A.C. God can do anything in a soul where Christ has a footing. Our progress and our knowledge of the mystery all hang on Christ being in our affections. And what we get in chapter 3 is that His genealogy is traced right down long after the captivity, i.e. the royal line is undisturbed by the captivity, and all the public failure of the assembly has not touched what is in Christ. He is Head in spite of failure on our side. It does not touch that line, does it?
Ques. Would the introduction of Hebron suggest the thought of purpose coming into view? It comes several times.
C.A.C. Hebron was built before Zoan; it seems connected with divine purpose which is before the world.
I thought chapter 4 gives us more how spiritual things are maintained in the saints. The introduction of Christ typically involves everything -- the whole counsel of God; but things have to be reached and maintained through the exercises of the saints; that is the subject of chapter 4.
Ques. Were you thinking of Jabez's mother?
C.A.C. And Jabez himself, so that on the side of the saints everything is reached through exercise and prayer.
Ques. Is that not the great feature of Judah -- "Hear, Jehovah, the voice of Judah" (@Deuteronomy 33: 7)?
{6}
C.A.C. Yes, we have been noticing in reading the books of recovery how much hangs on prayer. The whole movement of recovery is brought about by the intercession of Christ, also by the intercession of saints, and Jabez is one of the outstanding men of prayer in Scripture. He emphasises to us that things can only be received from God. We very often think that we can get things some other way, through ministry, reading the Bible or thinking about things; but we can only get things from God.
Rem. I am sure of that. Would you say that discipline runs along with it so that God can bring about what we request?
C.A.C. There was a painful exercise. Jabez was the product of painful travail on the part of his mother, and he took up the exercise of getting things for himself from God.
Rem. The Corinthians were reminded of it, for it is "God the giver of the increase".
C.A.C. Yes, we have delight in ministry, for ministry tells us what there is to be secured, but it never gives us anything. Is that going too far? That is why we are so interested, because it tells us what treasures there are. But if we want it, we must get it from God, we must pray; there is no other way. "Request", an emphatic word, you really want it. Sometimes I have heard a brother pray a long and wordy prayer, and at the end I have wondered whatever he wanted! I think the Lord would say, What is it you want? Jabez was a definite man and could state definitely to God what he wanted.
Rem. It was all for himself!
C.A.C. That is right! To desire to have made good in your own soul your position in Christ, that is the beginning, the first thing I want. I think we must start there.
Rem. Yes, so he prays to the "God of Israel", indicating
{7}
the whole scope of God in His word.
C.A.C. Yes, and his personal part in it. God likes the singular number in young souls.
Ques. Does Jabez's prayer contain the germ of Paul's two prayers in Ephesians -- the God of resurrection, and the great scope of God in Christ -- that is where there is enlargement, is it not?
C.A.C. It seems to me that Jabez represents a young soul on whom is dawning the blessing there is in Christ, and who wants it for himself. We must begin with what is individual. He wants to be blessed and rightly enlarged. Well, I think the blessing he desired is opened out in this book of Chronicles. It is all available, but if we want it we must go in for it in the Jabez way. Sometimes we have to wait a long time for the answers to our prayers, because we are not at all ready for them. I may ask for spiritual things for which I am not ready. God may answer now a prayer I made forty years ago.
Rem. A prayer to be blessed is precious to God; it honours Him.
Rem. He goes on, "And that thou wouldest keep me from evil". Would that be as a safeguard from inflation?
C.A.C. Yes, he wants God's hand with him for preservation. When we get enlargement and a bit of joy we get careless and the enemy takes advantage. After Paul had been in the third heaven he had the thorn. We need that mighty hand to preserve us from all the subtle snares of the enemy in connection with blessing.
Ques. What answers to the mother today? It looks as if Jabez was the product of a mother's exercise, watched over by prayer.
C.A.C. Would she represent the assembly in any way? It is one service of the assembly. The maternal exercise is the yearning for some product for God. We see it in Hannah, she wanted a man for Jehovah.
{8}
Rem. No meeting could die out if Jabez's mother was there.
C.A.C. Well, that is exercising.
Rem. Paul wrote, "My children, of whom I again travail in birth until Christ shall have been formed in you" (@Galatians 4: 19).
C.A.C. I think that is the mother-spirit.
Ques. Is that the cause of this definiteness? It is like Jacob's "I will not let thee go except thou bless me". And God changed his name, he was "Israel", the man who received the blessing. That meant enlargement.
C.A.C. And it is prayer! It is simply, I cannot, but God can -- that is prayer in a nutshell. If we do not pray on that line, we shall get nothing.
Ques. Are these exercises furthered in the valley of craftsmen?
C.A.C. I think the next exercise is that you want to be serviceable, to be able to do something to further the work of God; most of us are amateurs, not skilled workmen.
{9}
NOTES OF A READING @1 CHRONICLES 4
@1 Chronicles 4: 21 - 23, 38 - 43
C.A.C. We were considering last week that, the Spirit of God having introduced David, who is typical of Christ, we get in chapter 4 certain features marking the saints as indicating the line on which things are maintained on the side of the people of God. The first great principle is Jabez, the thought of prayer, and then the next special feature called attention to is the thought of craftsmen. "The father of the valley of craftsmen; for they were craftsmen". This introduces the thought of skilful labour, which, I suppose, is very essential. We should not be edified by prayer alone. I thought there was a moral order in the exercises suggested.
The first thing is that the Spirit of God would lead us to be enriched and enlarged in our own portion in Christ, and then the thought of being serviceable in connection with the work of the Lord. "Craftsmen" means skilful labour in connection with the work of the Lord.
It is an early exercise; you see it in Saul of Tarsus; "What shall I do, Lord?" (@Acts 22: 10). The work of the Lord is the most highly skilled work in the world.
Rem. So you get it in Judah, the royal tribe.
C.A.C. I have wondered if it is not an exercise we all need to take up -- to be skilful to serve the Lord.
Rem. The craftsmen are in the *valley*. Does that suggest the lowly character marking them?
C.A.C. That is very helpful. Paul puts it into words; "Serving the Lord with all lowliness, and tears, and temptations, which happened to me through the plots of
{10}
the Jews" (@Acts 20: 19). We need to take the service up. In the christian profession it has become official, a college education, but that is too poor. We must have an education and qualifications of far superior quality to that.
Ques. Would the qualification be affection for the Lord?
C.A.C. I suppose every brother or sister who prayed would be qualified for any service the Lord would have us take up. I see many christians who 'do their best'.
Ques. Would the gospel bring such to light? @Romans 16 gives Priscilla and Aquila "my fellow-workmen in Christ Jesus", and Andronicus and Junias "my fellow-captives", and Urbanus "our fellow-workman in Christ". Would they be workmen?
C.A.C. That is very good, and they were all skilled craftsmen, not amateurs. And it is everyone, we are all to fit in. It means great subjective exercise and there would be enquiry as to what the Lord would have us do in His work. And we want to be skilled like Aholiab and Bezaleel, who were highly skilled workers for the tabernacle.
Rem. Men and women were all employed in the work of the tabernacle.
C.A.C. It is an important exercise for us, and if we serve in the power of the anointing we do it in excellent quality; in the power of the anointing it cannot be improved upon. An old brother said that his encouragement was that no brother could preach like him. He had the sense that if any of us is qualified to render a divine service no one can fulfil it but ourselves. There is no thought of imperfection in the work of the Lord, whether gifts in the assembly in Corinthians or Ephesians. It all works from the top and is perfect in character. We want a very high standard before us of what the
{11}
work of the Lord denotes in skill and perfection.
Rem. "And to each one his work" (@Mark 13: 34).
C.A.C. And He would not give anything a man could not do. The Lord does not expect us to do another's work.
Rem. Sometimes it is work for the Lord and not the work of the Lord. "Abounding always in the work of the Lord" (@1 Corinthians 15: 58 ).
C.A.C. Yes.
Rem. A zeal for God, not of God; a similar thing in @Romans 10: 2.
C.A.C. Yes. We need the work of the Lord to be carried on in the way of instruction of the different parts, so that the whole body of saints becomes an intelligent company.
Rem. "Building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit" (@Jude 20).
C.A.C. And the work of the Lord is carried on mediately now; He puts it into the hand of the saints. It is no use to say, 'Well, I am not qualified', we must find out what our qualification is.
Rem. "To each one of us has been given grace according to the measure of the gift of the Christ" (@Ephesians 4: 7). There is responsibility, as you have reminded us before.
C.A.C. It is stimulating and encouraging to take account of that; we all want to be active labourers in the work of God.
Rem. There were some set over the service of song (chapter 6: 31) by David.
C.A.C. It all culminates in the service of praise.
Rem. It seems to begin with it in the prison at Philippi.
C.A.C. I thought we might consider briefly the byssus workers, for there are thoughts dropped in by the Spirit
{12}
of God -- intentionally put there by the Spirit of God.
Rem. It would be fine work.
Ques. Does it compare with "the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints"? (@Revelation 19: 8).
C.A.C. The saints are to be invested with features of Christ. I think that Epaphras was one of the byssus workers. He laboured fervently that they might "stand perfect and complete in all the will of God" (@Colossians 4: 12).
Rem. It is the working out in the saints here, not a question of ministry.
C.A.C. Yes, I thought so. In @Philippians 1: 9 it is, "And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in full knowledge and all intelligence, that ye may judge of and approve the things that are more excellent, in order that ye may be pure and without offence for Christ's day, being complete as regards the fruit of righteousness, which is by Jesus Christ, to God's glory and praise".
Christianity is not a negative thing, not merely that Christians do not do things, but they are invested with all that is positively good and right. I think that is the thought of the byssus throughout Scripture. They put on the new man which we have all done. All saints are regarded as having put off the old man and having put on the new man which is "renewed into full knowledge according to the image of him that has created him" (@Colossians 3: 10). If not, then we are not in the Christian position at all! Now we are to have exercise to put on these beautiful features which correspond to the features of Christ; for instance, it comes out in such words as these: "Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, long-suffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another" (@Colossians 3: 12, 13). "And to all these add love, which is the bond of perfectness" (verse 14). All this seems
{13}
to correspond to the byssus. If we have put on the new man we cannot possibly be comfortable to allow the contrary; that becomes instinctive. So the Christian's heart condemns him if he allows anything contrary to the new man.
Rem. You say we have all put on the new man. Will you explain when and where?
C.A.C. Well, Scripture does not precisely say when it is done. We want to understand, for it is what we want to get, all of us. Scripture always assumes it. We have it both in Ephesians and Colossians spoken of as a thing that is done.
Rem. And that *we* have done it -- a moment arrived at.
C.A.C. Well, I do not know when you did it!
Rem. There are young ones here and we want to be clear.
Rem. It is the normal progress of the Christian.
C.A.C. There is a moment in our exercises when we see the true character of the old man. The old man is not an individual but a collective thought; it requires all the children of Adam to make up the thought of the old man. There comes a time in our history when we see the true character of the old man with feelings of repulsion, and we come to the conclusion that the old man ought to be rejected by God, and if so, I come to that conclusion. Colossians is practical, not practice. J.B.S. has likened it to a man going to work. The first thing he does is he takes his coat off. That is not practice, but he *means* to work!
In the history of our souls we come to see the true character of the old man; all his features are taken from Satan. Have I any desire to go on with what takes character from Satan? But I see another thing, there is a new man. It takes all the saints to make up the new man, and all the features are of God and derived from Christ. Well,
{14}
any christian says: I am delighted with that, and then comes in the practice, and I must not let anything contrary come into evidence. If we have not come to it we should make haste and do so. Am I going on with what is of God or what is of the devil? "And your having put on the new man, which according to God is created in truthful righteousness and holiness" (@Ephesians 4:24). Well, that is what I am after. I fail and am inconsistent, but that is what I am after. Will that help the young ones?
Rem. It will help me anyway!
C.A.C. Think of the issue that is in view, that we come unto that full-grown man, and everything is measured by Christ. "At the full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ" (@Ephesians 4: 13). And we are going that way, and all the gifts are for that.
When we are baptised we put on Christ, baptism is the starting out. It is done in the power of the work of God in the soul, leading us to judge what is of the devil and be attracted by what is of God seen perfectly in Christ. If I look at Christ, if I see any characteristic of Christ, I am entitled to say: That is *my* life.
Rem. And it is not attainment but what is true of us.
C.A.C. These are the ABCs of christianity, what is normal; and all connected with the thought of byssus-workers. How much instruction lies in one verse!
We are apt to get the blemishes of persons before us, but if I could follow that brother or sister into their chamber what would they be praying for? I see a lot of failures but you want to follow the saints into their chambers. You might find the poorest sort of saint perhaps going through a struggle to get rid of hindrances. It is going on universally in the saints. Sometimes it is a long time before you see it, but it is going on all the time. If I look in my own heart, well, He is giving just the same
{15}
kind of exercise to every brother and sister. It is most important, this putting off and putting on, and all true exercise starts from there. Now I have come to the refusal of the flesh, and it means every day and all day long I refuse the features of the flesh. And what a happy day it is if I can put on some feature of Christ.
Rem. Then the potters are mentioned.
C.A.C. When you come on to this, what need there is for the formation of vessels. If all these beautiful things are true, I want to be a vessel for them. I may have knowledge of the Scriptures and gifts, but something more is wanted, i.e. spiritual formation. The potters are for this.
{16}
NOTES OF A READING @1 CHRONICLES 4 AND 5
@1 Chronicles 4: 23, 39 - 43; @1 Chronicles 5: 18 - 22
C.A.C. We have been noticing that this book was written after the return from captivity, and that it contains instruction for the remnant. This long list of names is not just a record, but is composed of names selected by the Spirit of God to be put on record, and so is connected in a way with the book of life, and the incidents mentioned are selected ones to convey to persons certain instructions.
Ques. What is the connection with the book of life?
C.A.C. It is a record surely connected with God's thoughts and ways of blessing; that is the character of this book. The whole of the book is occupied with the introduction of David; and it seems that the names are standing in some relation to Christ, and the incidents are selected incidents.
We have spoken of the byssus-workers in verse 21 of chapter 4, and we just touched on the potters last time; and then there are "those that abode among plantations and enclosures", of whom it says they dwelt there with the king for his work.
The byssus-workers refer to the saints being invested with the features of Christ, which would be practical righteousness; and the potters and those who dwelt with the king for his work would signify the thought of the formation of vessels suitable for the king and for his work.
Ques. What does the sentence, "And these are ancient things", mean? It seems rather a disjointed one coming in there.
{17}
C.A.C. It is interesting as coming in there. I think it reminds us of what John speaks of. He speaks of "That which was from the beginning", and of the commandment that was "from the beginning". You must not get away from the starting point! It signifies that that which is of God is of old standing, connected with His eternal purpose in Christ.
You can see that what is connected with the king and his work is abiding in its character. The king is surely Christ in His lordship, His authority and His work. It is very important that there should be suitable vessels; and they are looked at here from the side of responsibility, i.e. they are not gold and silver, but made by the potter. We need to be formed by our responsible exercises, formed as vessels suitable to the king for his work.
Ques. Do you connect these things with David, and not Solomon, in view of the day of Solomon?
C.A.C. Yes. I think that David is the great central object of this book, as typical of Christ. He has His place in David character, and it is possible for us to be with Him, to take up the exercise of being suitable vessels now. The epistles to Timothy and Titus have very largely in view the formation of suitable vessels, and tell the kind of persons the saints are to be, to be suitable to the Lord.
Rem. "If therefore one shall have purified himself from these ... . he shall be a vessel to honour, sanctified, serviceable to the Master, prepared for every good work" (@2 Timothy 2: 21).
C.A.C. It is astonishing how much there is of a practical nature in those epistles. They tell what kind of persons bishops, deacons and the saints have to be.
Rem. There are names mentioned in 2 Timothy.
C.A.C. And as we said in @Romans 16. There is the mentioning of these lists of men as suitable persons to be put alongside the epistle; they would not discredit it! Am
{18}
*I* a credit to the testimony, so that I could have my name put in the next book of chronicles?
Rem. So it says, "They dwelt with the king".
C.A.C. Yes, that is good. You do not generally hear of potters dwelling with the king! It is not the number of meetings I attend, but what I do every day that matters.
Rem. When it is seen in relation to the king, there is a dignity conferred upon it.
C.A.C. A dignity is conferred on the humblest service. If I think I am a vessel for the service of the king, I have to be careful.
Ques. What would those abiding among plantations suggest?
C.A.C. It rather suggests how the saints are put together in local settings. The Lord has seen to it that, if there is a proper exercise about being a suitable vessel, not malformed or useless, He would put us together in conditions favourable to right growth. "Enclosures" give the idea of separation from the world like the type of the walled city in the Old Testament, the type of the assembly having its own life but in separation from the world.
Ques. Is verse 23 connected with verse 22? They were men who had ruled over Moab.
C.A.C. That is very good, I think Moab is the pride of the flesh, and if that is overcome we are well on the way to being serviceable to the king.
Rem. Death had been met in Moab. There is no thought of doing anything in these conditions, unless death had been met.
C.A.C. Yes, quite.
Rem. There seems to be a moral order of a progressive nature here, beginning with the byssus-workers, till the saints are put together in company.
C.A.C. Things are worked out in skilful labour. There is no science in the world that requires so much
{19}
skill as christianity.
Rem. Paul's ministry progresses until things are linked up in priesthood.
C.A.C. And we are all committed to these features of the work; it all has to be worked out in skilful labour. We come in chapter 6 to priestly service. That is in view all through, it is all leading up to that.
Rem. The putting off and putting on would lead up to that.
C.A.C. Yes.
Ques. What is the thought at the end of the chapter?
C.A.C. I thought we got to the idea of what is aggressive, i.e. military expansion, the remnant in extended territory, which is an important exercise. God expects from His people that we should be on the look-out to extend our territory; so in the days of Hezekiah we get those Simeonites who extended their territory, and some in the next chapter in the days of Saul. So all through Scripture down to Hezekiah's times there was the possibility of extending the territory -- so there is still.
Ques. How do you apply territory in a spiritual sense?
C.A.C. I think the history of recent times shows how territory can be extended -- even during the last hundred years truth has been opened up to us in a wonderful way! There was conflict in chapter 4 with Ham and the Amalekites, and in chapter 5 with the Hagarites, i.e. the legal or religious side of things. Ham would be what man is naturally as governed by his natural desires, and the legal element has to be dispossessed, and in the dispossession we acquire something. If I gain a spiritual victory over my desires, it results in expansion of territory; I am the gainer.
Ques. Do you think we get any expansion without conflict?
{20}
C.A.C. We have to fight for every bit of ground that we possess. None of us possesses any spiritual territory unless we have fought for it.
Rem. There is not only territory but increase in those that occupy it.
C.A.C. Surely; the two go together.
Rem. It says that the sons of Simeon did not multiply like the sons of Judah, so that on the royal line there seems to be increase. The flocks coming in would suggest that there is pasture.
C.A.C. Yes, we should be always on the look-out for what would feed us, and for larger pastures.
Rem. Epaphras combated for the Colossians that they might stand perfect and complete in all the will of God. It is an extended thought.
C.A.C. It is possible for us to take possession of something that never has been possessed before and in the conflict with the Hagarites the spiritual features come out very distinctly. The Hagarites were delivered into their hands, for they cried to God in the battle, and He was intreated of them; because they put their trust in Him, and in verse 22 it says, "For there fell down many slain, for the war was of God". I suppose Paul writing to the Galatians was fighting the Hagarites, was he not?
Rem. If we do not take up the conflict, the enemy will take our possessions from us.
C.A.C. So there is a warning in the end of the chapter. They went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land, and the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Put king of Assyria and the spirit of Tilgath-Pilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away -- that is just the warning. Instead of overcoming, they were overcome and carried off into captivity, because they left Jehovah and went after the gods of the land.
Ques. What would the Amalekites represent?
{21}
C.A.C. We know how they came up as soon as the children of Israel had, typically, received the Spirit, to fight against them. They represent the flesh as worked upon by Satan in opposition to the Spirit. Satan stirs up the flesh to opposition. Then we have to cry to God. These people did, for these people trusted in God. When you get the religious element, you get God particularly with His people against it. Legal flesh is very deceptive and it needs the power of God to overcome it. God seems to take special note of what is against the Spirit. There are solemn warnings with reference to what is against the Spirit, that have not been given as to the Father and the Son. God is specially jealous with regard to any opposition against the Spirit. The Spirit is unseen, the world cannot see Him or know Him, yet it is the most wonderful thing that has ever happened, that, a divine Person Himself, He is come into certain limitations here that would not happen to a Person as in the Godhead. So God is jealous that anything opposing the Spirit should be treated unsparingly. We need to be more sensitive as to the things that grieve the Spirit, particularly doing things in a religious way, which is the great opposition to the Spirit now. Flesh putting on a religious character, that is the Hagarite.
Rem. A hundred thousand human souls were taken captive, so it was a large force, yet God comes in for a comparative few and they overcome and gain much spoil.
C.A.C. And God has given His people great deliverance in these days from what is legal. It is an immense thing to be free from the Hagarites -- a party that God hates. Paul tells the Galatians that in going back to Judaism they were going back to what was as bad as heathen idolatry. It has been said that the Spirit is more ignored in christendom than Christ is.
{22}
NOTES OF A READING @1 CHRONICLES 5 AND 6
@1 Chronicles 5:1, 2; @1 Chronicles 6: 31, 32, 48, 49
C.A.C. We have noticed that these names in the early chapters of Chronicles are selected names, not all of them being given. They are selected as standing in reference to the work of grace; and we find that out of the tribes three are selected for a special place in the ways of God, just as the Lord selected three of His own disciples for a special place of privilege and service. It is all done sovereignly. So we find that royalty is connected with Judah, the birthright with Joseph, and the service of God with Levi. It seems to me that the Spirit would have us link these thoughts together, as we see them linked in Christ.
Ques. Would you open out a little the thought in connection with Judah being peculiarly connected with the royal line?
C.A.C. It is distinctly said in verse 2 that "Judah prevailed among his brethren, and of him was the prince", that is, God was pleased to connect the thought of royalty with Judah. It seems to me this is the divine order in which we take things up; we must know the Lord first as the great Administrator of divine grace in the kingdom of God. It is our first lesson in grace, to see the royal place He has as Administrator of divine grace, everything coming to us through Him.
Ques. Does Peter suggest that side in speaking of the saints as "a holy priesthood" and "a kingly priesthood", in view of the service of God?
C.A.C. The first thing we must learn is how God serves us in Christ, how God ministers to us. Well, that is
{23}
connected with the Prince. It is like @Romans 5 really, a scripture we are all happily familiar with; "Having been justified on the principle of faith, we have peace towards God through our Lord Jesus Christ; by whom we have also access by faith into this favour in which we stand, and we boast in hope of the glory of God". And the whole chapter is the opening out of the royal grace which is administered in the kingdom of God through the Lord Jesus Christ. I think we must see that is how we begin.
Rem. In @Psalm 78: 67, 68 Judah comes foremost as the subject of divine choice; "He rejected the tent of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim, But chose the tribe of Judah". The element of divine choice enters into it?
C.A.C. Yes, and it has pleased God that royalty in this sense should be executed by the One who has come of the seed of David according to the flesh, and we have to learn to prize Him in that character first. I do not think that we get hold of the birthright first, or the service of God, but the kingly administration as vested in Christ -- all is administered through Him, the risen and ascended Man who is the true David.
Ques. Why is it prince and not king?
C.A.C. I suppose the title of Prince gives more prominence to what He is personally than to what He is officially. It is the thought of personal quality that attaches to Him. He is spoken of as the Prince of peace and the Prince of life. It is the One who in all His personal excellence administers the grace of God to us; the whole favour of God is administered to us in a rich and princely way.
Ques. Have we not sometimes been a little afraid of sovereignty, but seen rightly it gives stability?
C.A.C. The time comes in all our histories when we,
{24}
glad to be done with ourselves, become most thankful for divine sovereignty. My nature is such, so stubborn, that I should have resisted grace to the last drop of my blood. It is the same sovereignty that has wrought in each saint, so that we are brought into subjection to Him in the character of the Administrator of grace. God repeatedly passes by the firstborn, showing that nature is incapacitated.
Ques. It is not arbitrary, the passing by?
C.A.C. Well, there is a suitability in His sovereignty. There is never any reason for God to bless anyone, but if God passes by certain persons there is a reason in it that will be seen to justify Him.
If God is exercising His rights in the way of mercy and grace, they are still His rights. The gospel calls for obedience, it is not merely to be believed but obeyed. He says, "I have exalted one chosen out of the people" (@Psalm 89: 19). He passed His eye over all the people and selected Christ. He is the chosen One; God has made selection of Christ. So that now we are to sit down under His shadow, everything that is sweet and precious to us being administered through Christ in His princely character, and we are to sit under His shadow.
Rem. So that they came with one heart to make David king.
Rem. He is the eighth.
C.A.C. Yes. We could not furnish any reason why God takes us up. There is a moral reason for passing people by which will be justified, but there is no reason for blessing but God's sovereignty.
<blockquote>Why was I made to hear Thy voice? <br>And enter while there's room? <br>When thousands make the wretched choice <br>And rather starve than come. </blockquote>
{25}
I think there are steps; God carries on His work in an orderly way. First we learn royalty, and that there cannot be a reason why we came in except that we were called -- a mighty, unseen voice called us to receive Christ; and sitting down under His shadow we have all the favourableness of God shining down upon us in Christ.
Rem. "Justified freely" is "without a cause".
C.A.C. It is the same word as "They hated me without a cause". That is, on our side there is no cause whatever; it is simply a matter of God's favourableness. I suppose we pass on in our spiritual history to the apprehension of what the birthright involves. It is Joseph's. The birthright is bound up with the inheritance. The ability to take up the birthright was seen in Joseph, so he received a double portion, which is the birthright. As we go on we get an appreciation for the inheritance. I do not think that young believers care much about it; they do not think, of it, they do not want it. They are occupied, rightly, with the royalty of Christ and filled with wonder, love and praise at the immensity of the grace administered through Christ. When we get a little established in that (for we all could be more so), we go on to think of the subject of the birthright, which is connected with the inheritance.
Rem. "That they may receive remission of sins and inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith in me" (@Acts 26: 18).
C.A.C. A very good verse showing that the thought of the inheritance is linked up with the service of God.
Ques. What does the inheritance really mean?
C.A.C. We must begin with CHRIST. He is the true Judah, the true Joseph too. He is the Heir of all things in @Hebrews 1. He has taken "a place by so much better than the angels, as he inherits a name more excellent than they" (@Hebrews 1: 4). The heirship has to do with the
{26}
inheritance; to be an heir there must be an inheritance. It is rather what flows from sonship. "Thou art no longer bondman, but son; but if son, heir also through God" (@Galatians 4: 7). Heirship is in connection with sonship in Galatians, and with children in Romans, as we all remember.
Rem. It is "given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel".
C.A.C. We think of Christ as the Heir; we shall get no right thought of the inheritance otherwise. He is Heir of the inheritance, and between the creating and the inheriting He had to bring in redemption to relieve it of the encumbrance. He found it encumbered, sin and death had come in. He had to exercise the right of redemption.
Rem. "In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of offences, according to the riches of his grace" (@Ephesians 1: 7).
C.A.C. And not far from that, "The redemption of the acquired possession" (verse 14). All things are His acquired possession because He exercised the right of redemption; He cleared the encumbrance that was on the inheritance. These are very enlarging thoughts of Christ.
Rem. "So that, death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, the called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance" (@Hebrews 9: 15). Is that the clearance of the mortgage?
C.A.C. Yes, people wanted deliverance, and with a sense of sin could not appreciate the inheritance, nor take part in the service of God. It is applied to everything. He is exercising the right of redemption in reference to the whole universe; the whole universe is stained with sin and death and He has to remove it.
Rem. In the case of Israel the persons and the inheritance
{27}
have to be redeemed.
C.A.C. He created all things, a vast universe; it will not have a spot on it. Sin came in and affected the whole created universe, and He exercised the right of redemption through His death not only for persons but for things -- @Hebrews 2: 9. To think of Christ as Heir of all things, and then that He is going to have joint-heirs! The saints are called into this wonderful position as children of God, heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ. You should not see people going about with long faces as if they were poor! Do you think that anyone who is spiritually poor knows anything about this?
There is no other in view. You will not get any right thought of it unless you see there is only one. The longer we think of it the more astonished we shall be that He has joint-heirs and that they are to share with Him. God makes us heirs, "Heirs of God" -- not Christ.
You see at the present time the Heir has been killed. "This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may become ours" (@Luke 20:14). The dark plot has succeeded in the eyes of man. What are the nations quarrelling about? -- something that belongs to Christ; the inheritance belongs to Christ.
Rem. "To head up all things in the Christ, the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth" (@Ephesians 1: 10).
C.A.C. That is very good because it shows the extent of the inheritance. All things are to be headed up in Christ, and we have obtained an inheritance in Him; so the Holy Spirit would carry us into the whole vast expanse of what Christ is coming into, and people knowing a little about that would be qualified to serve God; it is the common portion of the saints in Christ. Nobody could say that it was not in the Scriptures. So this is the wonderful thought of heirship. It is so little dwelt upon in our meetings, and though we speak of sonship, we have
{28}
not much to say about what accrues to us as sons!
Rem. What about @Ephesians 1: 18 -- God's "inheritance in the saints"; is that a step further?
C.A.C. Yes, because it shows the extraordinary way God is pleased to take up His own inheritance. In a sense Christ's inheritance is God's, because it is all God's inheritance that Christ is Heir of, but He takes it up in His saints, and God enjoys it in seeing us enjoy it.
God's portion lies in our taking things up that He has given to us. It is as God sees His saints enjoying it that He enjoys it. How far have we entered into it, so that we can speak to God about it as persons who understand and appreciate it? God would say, 'I am delighted with it! You are valuing the very thing that is delightful to Me', that is how God gets His inheritance. There is a vast expanse that we enter into as inheritance in Christ, but God gets it in His people who can intelligently take up what God has given them in Christ.
Rem. "That ye may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height" (@Ephesians 3: 18). Is that it?
C.A.C. It is. It is the vast expanse, surpassing knowledge, of the inheritance, so that God may get the "glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages". That is the service of God.
{29}
NOTES OF A READING @1 CHRONICLES 6 AND 9
@1 Chronicles 6:31, 32, 48, 49; @1 Chronicles 9:24 - 34
C.A.C. My thought in suggesting these verses was that, as we were seeing last time, there are three tribes selected to bring out certain divine thoughts. The third one, which we left, is this one, Levi.
Ques. Would you say a word as to the great importance of the priestly family?
C.A.C. It has to do always with the service of God, and we find that David set Levites "over the service of song in the house of Jehovah after that the ark was in rest". I suppose that David here is a type of Christ as Head, providing for the service of song at a particular time, and I believe a time which answers particularly to the present time, for the ark was at rest and the house of Jehovah not yet built, and the service was carried on before the tabernacle of the tent of meeting. I think that gives it a particular application to the present time.
Ques. Why does the service of song come *before* the services in verses 48 and 49?
C.A.C. I suppose the most elevated form of service comes first, but verses 48 and 49 show that the service as inaugurated by Moses had ceased, but was carried on according to all that Moses had begun, so that David did not supersede, but added to the service.
Rem. The service of song was introduced by David.
C.A.C. That was a great addition, was it not? Moses instituted what is called the sacrificial system.
Rem. There had been songs, but no service of song.
C.A.C. It was a very great addition, because it evidenced
{30}
spiritual elements that did not connect with the sacrificial service. The great point of time is that the ark is at rest and the house of Jehovah not yet built. It is in tabernacle conditions that the service of song goes on; so really two services were going on, services of song, one at the tabernacle at Gibeon, and one before the ark in Jerusalem. The ark was not at Gibeon, yet the service of song goes on there, showing that though God had disowned the tabernacle of Shiloh, He still owned that at Gibeon. I think it is representative of the service carried on at the time of public failure. The tabernacle system God had forsaken, and had no intention of restoring, yet He was pleased, in the place of failure, for it to go on in a wonderful way.
Rem. The tabernacle service seems in shadow here, while the singers come into prominence.
C.A.C. David specially inaugurated the service of song. This is all interesting because it is written for remnant times. This is a very beautiful suggestion that in the presence of failure the service of song should go on under the headship of Christ.
Ques. How would the service of song go on at the present time?
C.A.C. It would be what is expressed vocally in the assembly, and would apply to hymns and utterances of praise.
Ques. Would the singing of the hymn on the mount of Olives, and Paul and Silas praising God, be illustrations of vocal conditions?
C.A.C. Yes, and therefore the headship of Christ would be evident on all those occasions, and if only two saints were left to walk together, Christ could be owned as Head, and under His headship they could still carry on the service of God. It is comforting, that.
Rem. The two in prison at Philippi could.
{31}
C.A.C. Yes, and so in the present time, which none could call exhilarating, it can be. To those two men Christ was Head. It cheers us, does it not?
The different elements alluded to in the first nine chapters of 1 Chronicles intimate most important matters to be attended to in remnant times; for it was written by Ezra expressly for remnant times.
Ques. Do you think that verses 33 - 36 give a kind of clue to what really animates the service of song? Heman (faithful) was of the descendants of Korah. He was the chief singer; then there were Asaph and Ethan.
C.A.C. You have the sons of Korah leading in the songs of God. "His mercy endureth for ever" is in one of their songs. They owed all to sovereign mercy, and are the ones to voice the singing. They came in on the ground of mercy. I do not feel that I can come in on any other ground! Whether it be conversion, or the light of separation, or a good meeting; it is all mercy! "His mercy endureth for ever" -- it touches every point.
The ark has reached its place of rest now, but the house built by Solomon looks forward to perfect conditions, when "there is neither adversary nor evil event" (@1 Kings 5:4). That is the key to those wonderful chapters of John from 13 to 17, when the ark was about to enter into its rest. "Jesus, knowing that his hour had come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end". The ark was about to enter into its rest, but the saints are to be left down here in the wilderness to carry on the service. At the present time tabernacle conditions continue, wilderness conditions. We can never gather without being reminded that we are in the place of assembly failure, just a handful instead of all the saints being here. It is a peculiar delight to God -- the perfect service that David ordered. If the service of
{32}
praise is ordered under the headship of Christ, it is perfect. I doubt whether we ever have a meeting where everything is under the headship of Christ. We need to be exercised as to it. Yet in spite of feebleness and ignorance God brings out the fulness of His mind. Think of having such a book as Chronicles written in a time of breakdown. It is very fine!
Rem. I suppose the sacrificial service goes on when we eat the Lord's supper? I suppose that is the great basis.
C.A.C. I thought the loaf and the cup were sacrificial and connected with the lordship of Christ (like Moses), not with His headship. It is the *Lord's* supper, and if we addressed God, He would not be pleased, it is not His supper. There is the thought of death as coming upon the Lord, that He suffered the whole weight of death, and He gave His body. It is not so much what He removed, but the wonderful way He removed it. That beautiful, holy life ended in death. How it takes away everything that we are. It would clear the ground and nothing would be left but Christ.
It is only in the life of Christ that we could come under His headship, that is, He is not the life for a company of sinners.
Ques. "I will not drink at all of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God come". Is that not the Lord severing His link with the earth, and then on the mount of Olives His link is with heaven? He can only be known thus. Does not the eating of the bread and drinking of the cup prepare us for that position?
Ques. Not only intelligently but affectionately too?
C.A.C. What a thought Mary must have had that *He* was going into death -- such a Person! This thought would cut us free from the world and every other man to be free for Him to use, as Head. It is the way we know
{33}
divine love; apart from what is sacrificial I do not know that there is any disclosure of it otherwise, but it is liberating from ourselves. A christian lives in the holy life of the Man who died for him in love. Then we should worship Him as Head: I do not think He would give us the good of headship before we worship Him as Head.
When together we should know His headship after the breaking of bread. We worship Him in wifely affection. These are great realities to be touched. I pray to enter into them more. Then having worshipped Him in wifely affection we should come under His headship for service. There would not be any discordant notes after that! The tendency is to pass too quickly from the Supper to the Father as if we could go collectively to the Father without the Head.
Rem. God would have a greater place if we went on these lines.
C.A.C. I think so. These were all intelligent men; you cannot imagine the tune breaking down there. These things do not happen there.
The unfailing and inexpressible character of His love is brought before us; He has given up His life sacrificially for us. We think of the love in which He did it -- what a spring for worship! It prepares us to accord Him supremacy as Head, and that would prepare us for Him to lead as Head. And we cannot do without the Lord. When we come to this side of things we want His support and indication how to move. We do not recognise how we need Him in the service of God.
Ques. I wondered if resurrection was the only sphere in which the Lord can move among His own. Are we not in danger of passing directly to ascension?
C.A.C. In @John 12 they made a supper for Him. It is on resurrection footing. A man sits at the table who had come out of death. He is a sample of those people, they
{34}
are all risen with Christ. If He comes to us it is after the order, according to the condition, in which He is. He says, 'It is for you', that is, it is to convey His love, an inexpressible love.
Rem. F.E.R. has said that the Lord takes no part in His remembrance.
C.A.C. In @Luke 24 it is quite different. It is the life in resurrection that He made known and His breaking of bread there shows it is by death. I wonder sometimes how we should feel if the Lord actually came in.
Rem. It says He stood in the midst of them.
C.A.C. And it says they were frightened. I think what has been said as to not passing over resurrection is very important. We must go by way of the resurrection position.
Rem. We shall never reach the service of song otherwise.
{35}
NOTES OF A READING @1 CHRONICLES 6 AND 9
@1 Chronicles 6: 15; @1 Chronicles 9: 1
C.A.C. My reason for reading these two scriptures is that they give the standpoint from which these two books are written, probably by Ezra, written at any rate after the return of the recovered remnant. They give us the truth as God would have it to be known by a recovered remnant, and so they contain what is most important for us if we are in that position. It is a great part of the Scriptures specially written for such persons.
Rem. It is very interesting. So the whole period concerned is similar to Kings, but from a different standpoint.
C.A.C. And from a standpoint that fits it into our own position in a remarkable way and is meant to help us at a particular juncture as intended for the recovered remnant in infinite mercy. So the whole book is pervaded by a spirit of grace. Failures are only mentioned in these books when they are needed to bring out the character of grace. They are steeped in grace, and so are specially adapted for the dispensation of grace.
The only thing that will stand is the economy of grace. That ought to be a fixture in our hearts and minds. It is the only thing that will stand for eternity. The most prominent Person in the first book is Christ, and we reach the end in the second book, which is that God should be served in a way suitable to His own desires and character. We have been reading Ezra and Nehemiah, ministry addressed to the returned remnant to encourage them, and now it is in spiritual order that
{36}
we should read these books written by Ezra. It is not a diversion from the line, but pursuing the line a little further.
Ques. Do you think it shows that God will encourage this matter of service right through to the end?
C.A.C. The first chapter is most essential to be familiar with. It shows the whole human family under God's view.
Rem. And then the bringing in of Christ, after all the misery and failure that came in.
C.A.C. The three branches of the human family are given. The three sons of Noah are brought into view without failure, they are in the view of God for blessing. God would have us familiar with this. The whole world is in view for blessing through the bringing in of Christ.
Rem. Shem means 'name' or 'renown'. Ham means 'blackened' or 'darkened'. Japheth means 'God will enlarge'.
C.A.C. We must remember that the whole human family is blessed of God through the bringing in of Christ. God told Adam to be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth. There was no more blessing for man till after the flood and God smelled a sweet savour from Noah's offering. His three sons were then under God's hand for blessing, and that is the position today. I think it is fine! (@Genesis 9: 1).
Rem. God blessed Jacob and Esau.
C.A.C. Yes. It is very beautiful that there is a blessing for Esau as well as Jacob. If God puts a name down in His chronicle, which corresponds to the book of life, you may be sure it is for blessing. He puts them down according to His thoughts. Christ died for every one of them, and He can act according to His own grace -- from Himself, all on the ground of Christ.
Rem. Isaac is before Ishmael, Christ is in view all
{37}
through.
C.A.C. Yes. Of these great fathers like Abraham it is said that in them all the families of the earth should be blessed. It was in view when God called him out. And in Israel shall all nations be blessed. It is particularly the character of the present time, all nations and all men.
Rem. Of Shem, Ham and Japheth, the sons of Japheth are named first. He is on the line of promise first.
C.A.C. Quite so, Japheth is the eldest, but Shem has particular blessing -- that Japheth, the gentile, may come and dwell in his tents. All that Shem had was to be shared by the nations. The Jews never took this in. God has all men in view for blessing; this is what I gather from @1 Chronicles 1. Of course, it required the coming in of Christ to make it effective.
Rem. "Thou hast ascended on high ... thou hast received gifts in Man" (@Psalm 68: 18).
C.A.C. All the gifts of the ascended Christ are not only for the children of God, but for the rebellious, "Even for the rebellious". God has such large thoughts, we have such shrivelled-up ones. We need to get out into the wide scope of God's thoughts. That is why we arrive at the knowledge of God in this chapter. I think Luke must have had peculiar pleasure in reading the Chronicles. This is a chapter where Ham, Shem and Japheth are all brought in, showing God's mind towards the whole human family.
Rem. We should think of the sons of Shem first.
C.A.C. Japheth has the first place really. God knew the greatest acting of His grace was to be amongst the gentiles. The assembly is characteristically a gentile company.
Ques. Is Japheth dwelling in the tents of Shem now (@Genesis 9: 27)?
{38}
C.A.C. Yes, we have not a thing that we have not received from Shem. We have Christ. "Of whom, as according to flesh, is the Christ", it says (@Romans 9: 5).
Ques. Why is Shem put first in Genesis?
C.A.C. Because it defines the one in which the blessing would come, that is God's sovereignty. He was going to enlarge Japheth and bring him to dwell in the tents of Shem.
Ques. Is Christ getting the greatest comfort from Japheth now brought into the tents?
C.A.C. Yes, Israel is dead, but He is getting His wife notwithstanding and she is for comfort to Him. Well, it seems to me that we get instruction of a very wide character here, for instance we read that Cush begot Nimrod (chapter 1: 10) and in verse 19, "To Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg, for in his days was the earth divided". In connection with them there is the thought of the development of government, and the ordering of the nations by God, all in view of blessing. We have to take account of that; we are living in Nimrod's day and Peleg's day, and we ought to understand that.
Rem. I am afraid I do not!
C.A.C. Well, it is worth giving a little attention to. After the flood God did not allow lawlessness to be unchecked; He put the sword in the hand of Noah, and so there has been a check on man ever since. Capital punishment was instituted by God.
Nimrod is the first man that had a kingdom, so that government as set up is a principle set up by God in the world. I think Nimrod is introduced here from that point of view, as exercising government under the eye of God. He began to be mighty on the earth. In the history in Genesis we are told he was mighty before Jehovah, that is, under Jehovah's eye in the exercise of government.
{39}
Rem. In @Genesis 10: 9, it says he was a mighty hunter.
C.A.C. Personally he was an unlikely person, not a character of which God would approve. He was a rebel, and a hunter finding his gratification at the expense of others, teaching that we should never expect government in the hands of his people. God allowed him to have the first kingdom. No ruler ever had power except as allowed of God, and in view of blessing. The government of the world from God's standpoint has in view the blessing of men. "It is God's minister to thee for good" (@Romans 13: 4).
Rem. There is a government going on in the assembly, so it speaks of "governments" (@1 Corinthians 12: 28).
C.A.C. Yes, there are governments in the assembly that would judge evil and can guide in times of difficulty, those with capacity for spiritual rule.
The ordering of God is in view of the blessing of men. So in Peleg's time, in his day the earth is divided. God divided the one human family into nations by altering their speech. It is God who made the nations. He has made them exist today in relation to the assembly.
Rem. "When the Most High assigned to the nations their inheritance, When he separated the sons of Adam, He set the bounds of the peoples According to the number of the children of Israel" (@Deuteronomy 32: 8).
Ques. Would you apply it in reference to the assembly in principle, as a principle that never changes?
C.A.C. All God's ways in government must be subservient to His grace. We cannot always see it. He will not let nations go a step further than what will carry out His thoughts. That is the position in which the assembly is set, amongst the nations, gathered out from among them. All the ordering of the nations is set in relation to the assembly; people do not think it, but we do. We know
{40}
that all going on in the nations is going to be broken up, as Daniel's image was broken to pieces by the stone cut out without hands. That is how we regard the nations; the next thing when the stone falls on them is that the whole structure crumbles into dust (@Daniel 2: 34, 35).
Rem. The saints should judge, and stand apart from, every principle of it now. We are going to judge the world.
C.A.C. The saints have a judgment about all the powers that be; the government of this country is highly favourable to the people of God, and the gospel can be freely preached. Of certain other governments we have a moral judgment; they are opposed to the saints and to all that is of God. We know what will happen to them.
Rem. He has "made of one blood every nation of men to dwell upon the whole face of the earth, having determined ordained times and the boundaries of their dwelling" (@Acts 17: 26).
C.A.C. "That they may seek God". God made a man a German that he might seek God, and He says, "Being therefore the offspring of God". It is very much in line with 1 Chronicles; God's object in dividing the nations was a pure action of grace to weaken them that they might be more dependent on Him, not arrogant and independent. And He uses them to weaken one another, sucking each other's life blood. God wants to weaken them to exercise His grace upon them. Supposing Russia were allowed to dominate and to destroy all the saints, well, God allows other powers to check it. God makes use of the power that is vested in man to restrain lawlessness, and provide either liberty or exercise for this country. If it became a persecuting power it would be discipline and profound exercise for us. Well, that is for blessing too. A christian is master of the situation; he is always on the top whatever happens. Nebuchadnezzar
{41}
had the most distinguished place in the government of the world that anyone ever had. He was the head of gold, yet he died converted. Think of meeting Nebuchadnezzar in heaven! It was the best thing that happened to Lot, those five nations taking him prisoner.
Rem. The devil said, "I will give thee all this power, and their glory; for it is given up to me".
C.A.C. The Lord did not dispute it. The devil has no right any more than Nimrod. It is a usurped authority that the devil has, with no right whatever, except what the sin of man has given him as right over man. I have often thought it strange that he dared to say such a thing. When the beast comes up out of the pit, it is satanic and will be judged under that form. The powers that be are ordained of God.
{42}
NOTES OF A READING @1 CHRONICLES 9
@1 Chronicles 9: 24 - 34
C.A.C. I think we come in this scripture to the responsible care and service of the house, not exactly the official service, but the diligent care that everything should be in order and ready for service.
In the Darby Translation we get the word "trust" several times; at the end of verse 22, "David and Samuel the seer had instituted them in their trust", and verse 26, "in their trust, ... for they stand round about the house of God during the night", and verse 31, "Mattithiah of the Levites ... was in trust over the things that were made in the pans". It signifies that there are certain things entrusted to us.
Rem. The note in the Darby Translation is interesting and says that they were appointed "on account of their faithfulness".
C.A.C. A trust is not of much value if it is not committed to faithful men!
Ques. Is that a gift?
C.A.C. No. I suppose anyone may be faithful without gift.
Rem. I wondered how far it was open to all, in relation to these holy things?
C.A.C. I think it is a holy trust that anyone loving the Lord would be delighted to take up. It is a test as to where our hearts are. Some long to take up some kind of trust for the Lord; it would be a poor kind of brother who does not. There are many things to be looked after, and a great deal of care and diligence is required so that
{43}
everything should be ready for the service of God. I think that should be in our minds. It does not do for us to wait for Lord's day morning for that.
Rem. It mentions "seven days from time to time" (verse 25). What does that mean?
C.A.C. It is very significant that the service ran in periods of seven days, is it not? I think our service runs in periods of seven days, and we have to be careful that the six days that precede the Lord's day should prepare everything for the service; so that the material is all on hand; you do not have to run and seek for it every time -- it is on hand.
Rem. I have often thought that all should be contributory, a yield, so that it should all find a place in the house of God, all contributing to that end.
C.A.C. Yes. The first thing is door-keeping.
Rem. I noticed that there are the thresholds of the tent, the entrance, and the entrance to the tent of meeting.
C.A.C. It suggests care as to what we bring in, does it not? Responsibility as to reception would be included in it. There is no thought in Scripture of people coming in on their own responsibility alone. We are exercised continually as to what we bring in; we have to guard the approaches to the house continually.
Ques. How would you apply that now?
C.A.C. It would no doubt refer to the kind of company we keep.
Rem. Whatever the service, is it not in view of the character of the service? The expressions: the camp of Jehovah, the house of the tent, the house of Jehovah, struck me.
C.A.C. Yes, that is right; we have to do with God and we have to be careful not to admit anything into our ways that is not suitable to God. Companying with the
{44}
world does not preserve the holy character of the service of God. The value and power of the public service depends very largely on what goes on in the households of the saints -- the conversation and the books read there. It may be a real drag upon the service of God.
Rem. The test of a thing is the house of God, not what I think of it.
C.A.C. Exactly. Is it suitable to stand in relation to the service of God? There should not be anything in our houses unsuitable to that. This all enters into keeping the doors of the house, does it not? We are all to be doorkeepers in that sense. It says that Phinehas was the leader over them formerly. Phinehas is not the sort of man I would like to come into my house if anything were unsuitable. He is a man who could use the sword; he would not tolerate any worldly admixture.
Rem. Nehemiah cast out all the household stuff of Tobijah.
C.A.C. We have to guard the treasures all the time. It speaks of some in verses 26 and 27. We are in charge of the most wonderful stores ever entrusted to anyone. These stores of spiritual wealth are all found in the house and they are to be guarded.
Rem. The thought of treasuries or stores is like a thread running through the Scriptures. Why is it?
C.A.C. I think it refers to the wealth that has been permanently accumulated in the house; the Scriptures for instance. We have the oracles of God. Think of what it was to have the gospels and epistles; every one as it was written was put into the treasury. At first they only had the men who wrote them. All the ministry of the Spirit that has gone on in the assembly is part of the wealth that is there and should contribute to the assembly, do you not think? You think of the wealth that has come into the house even in our time -- the amazing
{45}
spiritual wealth and fulness that has been brought out in the lifetime of some of us here. It is our responsibility. Everything from J.N.D. and F.E.R. -- I have got a responsibility in regard to it, I have to guard it. What kind of service would go on if we were consciously possessed of all in the ministry and all in the Scriptures? We should want to lengthen the morning meeting! Every word in the Scriptures is committed to our personal trust, and if we do not keep it, printed Bibles will not keep it.
Rem. To be kept, not to be reserved, but used.
C.A.C. It is all to be utilised in the service of God, because it is there. We do not produce it when there at the meeting, because it is all in hand; what is required is there to be drawn upon. It is to be guarded through the night, verse 27. "They stayed round about the house of God during the night". Is that not how we should regard all ministry?
Ques. What do you mean by guarding it?
C.A.C. Well, seeing that it is not taken away from us by any means, or allowed to deteriorate. We are entrusted with the holy charge of everything ministered by the Spirit.
Rem. "Keep, by the Holy Spirit which dwells in us, the good deposit entrusted" (@2 Timothy 1:14).
C.A.C. I think that is exactly the thing in New Testament language; we should think of it all in that way.
Ques. Did not F.E.R. say that we bring the Lord with us to the meeting, or words to that effect?
C.A.C. We shall not find Him there if we do not bring Him. It is what we bring. We want to take up the sense of responsibility. It is feeble with us; I know it is with me. We are slow to take things up as a responsible trust.
Then there are the instruments in verse 28, and so on.
Rem. "Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the
{46}
doors of the house of Jehovah" (@1 Samuel 3: 15).
C.A.C. Does it not show that even young saints can have a part in this trust -- even a boy! There may be one young brother or sister that can do wonderful things; it is not limited to grey-haired old brothers.
We want all the utensils of service all ready for use; that is the point of caring for them, so that everything should be ready for all to function rightly.
Rem. Elsewhere the charge is under the hand of Aaron. Why is that?
C.A.C. The great point in Chronicles is that it is under the hand of David. Christ's headship is more prominent than His priesthood in Chronicles. If I am subject He is able to indicate what I am to do. It is the suitability and the furnishing here; there is nothing about the actual service here. Everything here is clean and ready for use. "The fine flour, and the wine and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices", are all ready. The great thought is that in the house all is ready.
Ques. What is the signification of those things?
C.A.C. They were material for offerings and stood specially in relation to the oblation; it is not the thought quite of what is sacrificed here. We saw in chapter 6 that the sacrificial system went on according to Moses, and the service of song with David. It is connected with the appreciation that is in the assembly of the precious humanity of Christ, the introduction of what is of God in Jesus Christ come in flesh. All that is pleasing to God and precious to Him is found there. Well, there is richness then. We touch it very lightly in the morning meeting, but we do touch it in the holy humanity of Christ as anointed. It has helped me that we can learn what is spiritual in Christ. It is levitical care of all that has come out in Christ, because it is Christ personally here. The point here is it is treasured, not offered, it is *ready* to be
{47}
offered.
Ques. Would the scene in @John 12 illustrate it in some measure? The ointment was treasured and then expended.
C.A.C. Yes, but she had not to go and buy it. The people who had to go and buy for themselves were too late! Often in a meeting we should like to run and buy things, to freshen things up, but it is too late then. I do not mean that the Lord does not come in in His grace and make a poor meeting into a rich one. When it is there, it is only a question with the brothers as to which shall be the first to voice it. It is all there. It gives me a wonderful thought of the assembly, of the wonderful treasure that is there when we are together in assembly character. Everything in the Scriptures and the Spirit is here. We do not know much about it, but that is the thought of Scripture. The vessels were brought in by number. It is very fine. They were counted over to see that nothing was missing.
Ques. What is the thought of the frankincense?
C.A.C. I think as far as we can gather from Scripture that frankincense stands in relation to prayer. It would be the voicing in prayer of what would be infinitely delightful to God, especially prayer of assembly character -- such as the prayers of Jesus, how delightful they were to God! They astonished the disciples, so that they said, "Teach us to pray". They never heard anyone pray like that, and they wanted to pray. Then the ointment of the spices, the sons of the priests compounded it.
Ques. Is that a limited thought?
C.A.C. It is a part of the whole furnishing; it is the holy anointing oil. The anointing is a public matter. It is important that in the service of the assembly all that is done publicly should be in the grace of the anointing.
Rem. It requires skill and priestly sensibilities.
{48}
C.A.C. I feel we are often on the line of doing the best we can, but that is not good enough for God; only what is done in the power of the anointing is acceptable. All this enters into the preparation for service.
Then we have things that were made in the pans and loaves in rows -- so that the loaves speak of the saints as identified with Christ, having Christ as their life, and that is how we properly view the saints in the assembly, as persons who have Christ as their life.
Rem. The Kohathites had this service.
C.A.C. Of course, if we could not understand the loaves set in rows, we could not understand the Lord saying, "My brethren" (@John 20: 17). If He said, "Go to my brethren and say to them ...", He looked at them altogether apart from the flesh, and as one with Himself, and He sent the message to them as "My brethren".
Ques. They were sanctified and set apart; is that why the bread is in rows?
C.A.C. It is all a subject for meditation and prayer. We might well covet to be like those in verse 33, free for employment. They were perfectly free from every other claim. In the assembly we are free from all natural claims so as to be wholly occupied in the service. There are obligations pressing very heavily on some of the brethren now, but some are finding out that they can be free from them all because their heart is in the service, and in the service of the Lord we can be free from every claim. A man's wife is not his wife in the assembly, she is his sister. So we can be without distraction.
{49}
NOTES OF A READING @1 CHRONICLES 10 AND 11
@1 Chronicles 10: 1 - 14; @1 Chronicles 11: 1 - 3
C.A.C. On a previous occasion we saw how David was introduced as a prince and how he ordered the service of song in the house of Jehovah and also the position of trust to see that everything was provided in readiness for the service -- all those numerous spiritual suggestions that we were looking at last week. I think the mind of the Spirit is that we should look at this chapter before us in the light of all that has gone before.
Ques. Is your thought that in the light of what you are considering the man after the flesh has to go?
C.A.C. What is not in keeping with the order of things we have been considering must go, the unfaithful man must go in death. The more we consider what God has brought in in Christ and by Christ, the more plainly we should discern that the man after the flesh can have no part in it whatever. So Chronicles does not give the history of Saul, and is only concerned to show that he *died*.
Rem. "And all his house" (verse 6) is very striking.
C.A.C. It is, it is a clean sweep of all that generation typically.
Ques. Would you say that the Lord was behind it all -- the transference of the kingdom of Saul and his death?
C.A.C. It is very striking. It was not the Philistines that killed him; it says distinctly that Jehovah slew him (verse 14). It was directly attributed to Jehovah, He slew him. In @Acts 13 it says God "removed him".
{50}
So this is very important instruction for us, giving something we have to come to. We have to learn the death of the unfaithful man for ourselves.
Ques. Is that to be learnt in the light of all God has brought in?
C.A.C. Yes, and really the end of the unfaithful man we learn in the death of the faithful Man. It pleased God that the man after the flesh should have his opportunity and should be tested, so that it might be known by experience what the character of that man was. It took forty years of experience to learn the character of that man.
Rem. Elsewhere Samuel is told not to mourn for him.
C.A.C. Yes, God says, "I have rejected him". The man after the flesh is rejected by God -- he cannot be subject; none of us can afford to give him any footing whatever.
Ques. Does the teaching of the chapter correspond with @Romans 6?
C.A.C. I think that is a good suggestion. It would fit in with what the men of Jabesh-Gilead did, for they buried him. In spiritual import they identified themselves with what God had done. It was a matter of personal exercise: they buried him. That was what was in your mind, I think. It rather goes with the exercise of baptism. We were identified with Christ in baptism. God was pleased to put baptism at the very gateway of the public christian profession, and we were publicly baptised to Christ; but then He had died; no one was ever baptised to Christ till after He died. If we had not some thought of living with Him we should not care for baptism; so people used to put off baptism till they were about to die, when it was no use. It is no use for a man to be baptised who is going to heaven and certainly no use for a man going to hell. He is going to live here identified with a
{51}
Christ that has died. Whose death did He die? -- His own? Certainly not! The death that He died was my death, and we really come to see the end of Saul in the death of Christ, speaking typically.
Rem. "Concerning whom does the prophet say this? Of himself, or of some other?" (@Acts 8: 34).
Rem. A terrible way out, was it not? Saul fell upon his sword.
C.A.C. Yes, actually he was a hopeless man, and the flesh is always hopeless. It is a terrible thing to those who have not life -- death is a terrible thing to one who has no link with One out of death. What we find is that David is alive all the time that this is happening; the Spirit of God had introduced David and he was there before Saul died; and before God had put man in the flesh to death He had introduced Christ, so our death with Christ is in view to our living with Him.
Baptism goes with lordship, so that what follows is that they made David king; they all gave him the place of supremacy. They come to him and say, "We are thy bone and thy flesh". Baptism is in view of lordship. You can be baptised in about a minute, and it will take all your life to learn what it is -- a lifetime lesson. I suppose some hardly come to understand it until they come to die themselves.
"We are thy bone and thy flesh", they said. They had the thought of being thoroughly bound up with David, and we with Christ. "For if we are become identified with him in the likeness of his death, so also we shall be of his resurrection" (@Romans 6: 5).
God had prepared their hearts, and we never get anything from God apart from preparation. They had thought of David for many years, they really apprehended God's thought in advance of the time. He works and prepares hearts by giving them some appreciation of
{52}
Christ long before they see the end of man in the flesh. Otherwise we should collapse in despair, should we not, if we saw the end of the man in the flesh before Christ? We are baptised to Christ; Israel and Moses are a kind of illustration of what baptism is. It is a great thing to come to it, that we are of Christ's bone and of His flesh. It is as much as to say: We live in Thy life. It is good when we come to the point that we really see the end of the man in the flesh, and that we are bound up vitally with Christ, and He is our life.
Rem. He said to Saul, "Why dost thou persecute me?"; is that the thought?
C.A.C. That is the idea -- the life of Christ coming out in His saints made Saul of Tarsus persecute. The thought of living in the life of the One who died for us is very precious, we need to take it in more and more. "We are thy bone and thy flesh". Here it is not Christ that says it, but it is so in @Genesis 2 typically. The Man says, "This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh". Typically it is Christ acknowledging the assembly as of Himself. But here typically it is not Christ, but the saints who say it. And it is in the light of it, I suppose, that we come together to remember the Lord.
Rem. It is in view of the service of God?
C.A.C. It has to do with the service. The service of God is set up by Christ; therefore it is important that we should come under the control of Christ. If we are in subjection to the Lord, we come into the gain of the Spirit. If we are not subject, we might as well not have the Spirit at all; the Spirit can do nothing with insubject persons.
As we break bread, we set forth that we are one body. "We, being many, are one loaf, one body; for we all partake of that one loaf" (@1 Corinthians 10: 17). The saints looked at as the one loaf is very like these men saying, "We are
{53}
thy bone and thy flesh".
Ques. Laban recognised that in some way, I believe?
C.A.C. He referred to it as family kindred, but there is more than that with the saints, there is a corporeal identification with Him. You could not have it in a natural way, could you? So Scripture says "Your bodies are members of Christ" (@1 Corinthians 6: 15).
Ques. How far does @Philippians 3: 3 come in here?
C.A.C. Well, that is clearly the christian position defined in very few words. "Do not trust in flesh" means that Saul has gone out. These people rejoiced in Christ Jesus; they were instructed of God that He was Prince and Leader. Now Saul having gone out, the people are in perfect liberty to find all their delight in David. We often sing in the morning meeting, "We live of Thee". He gets His place and is in control, and the service is then all ordered according to God.
Ques. What was the thought of David making this covenant with the elders of Israel?
C.A.C. I think it went with the way the Lord made Himself known in resurrection. He linked Himself on with them. They must have had a very distinct sense that there was a living bond between Him and themselves.
Ques. Does Hebron give the thought of purpose?
C.A.C. It is not quite the same as Jerusalem, and I should think would be connected with the purpose of God and the resurrection position.
Ques. Does it refer to fellowship at all?
C.A.C. I think there is some thought of that in the words "gathered themselves". The antitype is in the saints coming together to give Him His place. This is in part individual, but not all. He wants to have His place collectively. He wants to see the saints attracted together powerfully for Him to get His place, for what God gets depends on Christ getting His place.
{54}
Rem. The thought of leadership is seen in "Thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel"; then to feed Israel and be a prince, and then he is king, he is supreme. His authority is recognised and followed.
C.A.C. We should hardly get the gain of Christ's headship if we do not give Him His place as Lord.
Rem. So the Supper makes much of the Lord, and brings Him into prominence.
C.A.C. In @1 Corinthians 11 I have noticed that "the Lord" is mentioned seven times in two or three verses. He comes in first as Lord, so each would be exercised to be in subjection to Him, and if He had us all under control, it would be very easy to change His attitude and take His place as Head. I do not see how the service of God could go on under any other principle. So they anointed him, the people did so, and I think the Lord looks for that. They had come to the truth of it themselves. It is very much like saying 'Lord' to Jesus in the power of the Spirit. When we do that we truly anoint Him, so when He is anointed He will take charge, and loves to, of all matters in the service of God.
Rem. Every movement would be under His lordship from the very beginning.
C.A.C. Yes, all that is under His control. There are many services but one Lord; so no service would clash with another. It is painful if it does and shows that there is a want of subjection to the Lord. We all own this. Raising a tune is one of the services carried out under the Lord. All that goes on belongs to the services that go on under the same Lord. So the portion before us is very important, the end of the unfaithful man who is very close to us, so that it keeps us constantly on the alert. That held in the soul enables us to take the ground spiritually that we are bone of His bone and flesh of His flesh, and we are glad to think of the place that He fills by
{55}
appointment; that of Prince and Head.
Rem. "I have anointed my king" (@Psalm 2: 6).
C.A.C. That is God anointing His king; on this occasion the people anoint Him. Are *we* anointing Him, giving Him by the Spirit all that is due to Him? Then he enters into covenant with them -- there is a definite covenant. There is no covenant subsisting now between Jehovah and Israel.
Ques. But there is between Jehovah and David?
C.A.C. Yes, viewing David as prophetically Christ the covenant stands firm, nothing can invalidate it. Speaking of it typically there is a definite bond with the Lord formed in resurrection; He was very particular to link on with them.
Rem. In @Acts 1 He "assembled with them".
C.A.C. And He ate and drank with them -- a wonderful thing! It is wonderful to think they could eat and drink with a risen Man, and He ate and drank with them. And the establishment of the kingdom was necessary to the service of God.
It all has a definite bearing on ourselves, having been written in remnant days in view of recovery.
{56}
NOTES OF A READING @1 CHRONICLES 11
@1 Chronicles 11: 4 - 14
C.A.C. It is very wonderful that the Spirit of God hastens in this book to bring David to his highest point of exaltation. You get nothing of his seven years at Hebron; that is passed over to bring David at once to Jerusalem -- to Zion, reminding us surely that we have to do with Christ in His highest place of exaltation. The Spirit of God begins with Him there, and we begin with Him there. In this present dispensation of grace we begin with Jesus exalted to the highest possible point.
Rem. In connection with passing over the period at Hebron, it was something like the Lord being here with a few of His own in humility and all that marked Him then; but really we start with Him as the ascended Man.
C.A.C. It is very good to see that, and that the Spirit of God has in mind that we should all move with Him. "All Israel" is mentioned in verses 1, 4 and 10 -- all Israel are brought in as moving with David, the Spirit of God having in mind that all the saints are to move with Christ.
Rem. We are all typically included as having part with Him in His personal place of exaltation.
C.A.C. It is a great help to have that distinctly before us, that grace has taken on a most wonderful and glorious character in Jesus being exalted. While the Lord was here grace was not positionally in the setting that it is in now. All the fulness of grace was there in Him personally, but it was not seen in Him positionally.
{57}
Rem. Now it is universal, available to all.
C.A.C. It is wonderful to think that God has brought about that there are those on earth who are of His flesh and of His bones, and so capable of identifying themselves with Him, prepared in their thoughts and affections to link themselves up with a glorified Man in heaven. There is nothing more wonderful on this earth.
In Ziklag we have what answers to Romans, and really Hebron answers to Colossians, and Jerusalem to Ephesians, as has often been noticed. So that grace takes on a character in the epistle to the Ephesians that does not appear anywhere else. Nowhere is it so magnified as in Ephesians; it is magnified positionally. Jesus being glorified we can sing now, 'O the glory of the grace'. It required that Jesus should be glorified before He could in the fullest way glorify the Father. He said, "Glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee" (@John 17: 1). There was something still required when the Lord was on earth. Now that He is glorified grace takes on a wonderful character -- an inconceivable character to the human mind.
Rem. "The riches of his grace" (@Ephesians 1: 7).
C.A.C. And in chapter 2:8, "Saved by grace". It takes in the whole thing, that we are seated in Him in the heavenlies. No one understands being saved by grace until he sees it includes that.
Rem. The Lord said, "I go to prepare you a place" (@John 14: 2).
C.A.C. Yes. The Lord never had anything less than the full thought of grace in His mind, and it is wonderful that as saints we can move with Him from death to resurrection and then to ascension, entitled to move with Him to the highest place, the most glorious place in the universe. You can understand how the Spirit of God was eager to get there.
{58}
Rem. They moved in affection as being of his bone and of his flesh.
C.A.C. They were in corporate identification with him. There should be with us a consciousness that we are of His bone and of His flesh, that is, of His order. That order of Man is seen in Christ risen from the dead and the Spirit would lead us into the realisation of that order of Man. If we are of His bone and of His flesh, we have finished with Saul, the man after the flesh; we are finished with the world if we are of the bone and of the flesh of the risen Man.
Rem. You must get on to the Jerusalem position to get that fulfilled.
C.A.C. It is interesting to see that in Chronicles the Spirit will not be delayed at Hebron; He hastens to Jerusalem, and the Spirit of God would always be intensely set on our reaching the full thought of the exaltation of Christ. What is magnified here is that he takes the stronghold of Zion, which is the city of David. That is a most important point in Scripture because it is the introduction of Zion, and we all know it has a most remarkable place in Scripture, in the Psalms and in the prophets, and here we get it first introduced. And we come into the thought of Zion too, we "have come to mount Zion" (@Hebrews 12: 22). We ought to know something about it if we have come to it. God dwells there. "Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined forth" (@Psalm 50: 2). "The mount Zion which he loved" (@Psalm 78: 68). So it represents what He loves, where He dwells and out of which He shines -- a system which answers perfectly to God.
You can quite see how God was cherishing in His heart the thought of an order of things which would satisfy Him and in which He could dwell and in which He could be known by His creature man, treasuring it
{59}
for four thousand years, wrapping it up in beautiful types. Every time the Spirit wrote down "Zion" in the Scriptures God was delighted and said, as it were, 'That is before Me and never will be set up until My Son comes down into death and goes to glory'. Nothing could be added to the Lord personally; He was as great as a Babe in the manger as in the glory. The gospels were written and should be read in the light of His being glorified. The references to Zion in the Psalms would repay careful consideration. In @Psalm 87 you get the thought of being born in Zion, a wonderful thing; the saints are really born there.
"Jerusalem above ... which is our mother" (@Galatians 4: 26) is a similar thought; but God writes down in a book the names of those born in Zion. We have been born into that wonderful system which all radiates from Christ in glory.
Rem. It would have a wonderful effect if we realised we started from there.
C.A.C. Christians are very slow (and we cannot say much for ourselves) to take in the fulness of what is established in Christ glorified. All christians value His death or they would not be Christians at all, but many do not go beyond the cross; but really what we have to do with is Christ glorified. I think the majority of believers believe that Jesus has gone back into the position of Deity; they do not entertain the thought of a glorious Man in heaven, a Man with a real body of flesh and bones, and a glorious system of grace centred in that Person. It would deliver saints from themselves and the world in every form.
This "castle of Zion" (A.V.) seems to have been the great stronghold of Zion. I think we should understand that there is a tremendous power of evil in the universe. Of course Satan is a great power of evil, and there are
{60}
principalities and authorities and wickedness in the heavenlies, and death itself is called an enemy -- all these are powers that are seeking to obstruct God's way. They said, "Thou shalt not come in hither". I think that Zion represents the headquarters of the enemy where all evil powers are entrenched and would not let the Lord have His way. Satan and all with him are determined to obstruct God being known. Nothing is so hateful to him and his angels. But the Lord Jesus has entered into combat with all these powers of evil, "having spoiled principalities and authorities, he made a show of them publicly" (@Colossians 2: 15). He, the true David, has vanquished every power that was hostile to God and to grace, at Calvary.
Rem.
<blockquote>'The mighty work was all His own, <br>Though we shall share His glorious throne'. (`308:2)</blockquote>
C.A.C. It does not identify any of them in the taking of Zion; we come on to the mighty men; Christ has had a good many, and has some still, but David took Zion on his own. The mighty men come in to promote the exaltation of David; now we are all called into that business. The Lord Jesus has met everything that was adverse to God and to us, for what is adverse to God is adverse to us; He has overthrown it all and made the city His city. The great thing is to see what Christ has effected. He has annulled Satan, Scripture says, and death is annulled. People may say, 'But O, not death, it is as busy as ever, you see it every day around you'. Ah no, in Christ you see Satan annulled and death too. The object of the Spirit of God is not reached unless we are brought into it.
Rem. And we are encouraged by the consideration of the Lord, and we come into the joy of it so.
C.A.C. That is just the point. We are painfully familiar with the scene of pain and death, but God would have us
{61}
familiar with Zion where nothing enters but what is pleasing to God. He would have us see Him shining out in His wondrous grace, and live in it. The city of David is a permanent idea.
Ques. What corresponds to the city of David today?
C.A.C. I suppose that you see first the system of grace which has been brought in by the Lord Jesus Christ, and then you see the saints all identified with it in that they dwell there. I think you must bring in the assembly to get the full thought of it.
Rem. And the thought of administration; it supposes all that He has secured at the hand of the Lord; it must of necessity include the assembly and His handling of it.
C.A.C. Yes, there is a whole system of things mentioned in @Hebrews 12 in which Zion takes the first place. It is in contrast to Sinai, the system of law, and we might say Satan has captured that system.
Rem. "Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined forth" (@Psalm 50: 2).
C.A.C. Yes, it is the city of the great King, beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth (@Psalm 48: 2). God would have Christ and what is expressed in Him the joy of every man.
Rem. "That he might display in the coming ages the surpassing riches of his grace in kindness towards us in Christ Jesus" (@Ephesians 2: 7).
C.A.C. That is Zion! We are going to be His display in the coming ages of the surpassing riches of His grace in the kindness of God. You cannot add anything to the surpassing riches of His grace and the kindness. When the assembly comes down, it has the glory of God, it is His greatness in grace, each constituent part a sinner saved by grace. F.E.R. used to say that grace is commensurate with glory, so you must have a glorious Saviour to set it forth.
{62}
"And he built the city round about". Well, that is going on in our hearts in this room tonight. The building is going on, bringing persons into the good of it so as to give God the glory of it. And God sets these things before us pictorially; He does not give us just statements; it is marvellous grace.
Can we not see how all this would prepare us for our part in the service of God? This is a book for remnant times at the close. We must all give our whole hearts and minds to the consideration of these things; it is an urgent matter and God's will for us.

NOTES OF A READING @1 CHRONICLES 13
@1 Chronicles 13: 1 - 14
C.A.C. The teaching changes in this chapter; David has previously been a type of Christ, while now the ark of God is the subject. The ark of God typifies Christ as seen in the gospel of John.
Ques. The remnant had not the ark; would that have a bearing on the subject?
C.A.C. The ark of God is God being in full declaration. It has its bearing on remnant conditions. There has been a long period in the history of christendom where the ark has been disregarded.
It is the "days of Saul", when what is pleasing to men is in the ascendancy. It is impossible under such conditions that there should be enquiry of the ark of God. There were suitable conditions in David for the ark to get its place, so it suits remnant times very well. This book was written for them.
Rem. John's writings come in the close of the period.
C.A.C. John's writings come in when Paul's dispensation had broken down. Then faith and love will look to God. There is no spot or stain on the ark, and that is cherished in the hearts of God's people. During the last hundred years there has been movement towards the ark and we have been learning something of the due order. God intends the general movement to affect the whole assembly ("all Israel"), David being a type of the work of God in saints that cherish the thought of Christ being honoured. Christ as the ark is God in full declaration,
{64}
but this entails the service of God being carried out perfectly, and they had to learn by their failure how to honour Christ.
Many lovers of Christ serve Him zealously but displease God in the way they carry out the service. They serve Him in relation to what He is to them and not according to God. That is the lesson of this chapter. Some believers take 'the sacrament' after a preaching. That displeases God very much.
It is a great thing to apprehend Christ as the ark of God -- the full establishment of God's will, without a flaw. It is not found in christendom. The ark being God in declaration means inaugurating a service which is compatible with its own perfection. It is God saying, 'I want you to know Him in relation to Me'! It was a great work of God for David to bring the ark up, and there was need for the utmost care and consideration in doing it. Jehovah sits "between the cherubim".
The One who smote Uzza was discriminating and exercising His attributes judicially that men might honour Christ and give God His place.
Rem. Ezra was an "instructed scribe".
C.A.C. He would have been very useful to David if he had been at hand, and could have told him how the ark should be carried.
Ques. Why should it be carried on the shoulders of the priests; would it indicate power and affection?
C.A.C. It would show that it depends on spirituality; there is none in a "new cart". The Philistines had little knowledge of God, and He accepted it from them, but Israel had the oracles of God. It is a matter of personal exercise and affection to secure a place for Christ that is suitable, and in a way that is suitable.
Ques. Is Corinthians analogous?
C.A.C. Corinthians illustrates this chapter. They
{65}
were touching the holy elements of the Supper with unsanctified hands, and many of them became weak and infirm and many died.
In that epistle Paul stresses the thought of the temple. "The temple of God is holy, and such are ye". It was not done in due order; the assembly is a place of order and anything disorderly is always displeasing to God. It is all a matter of leaving the due order. We need the utmost care to gather up from the Scriptures the will of God; it must correspond with the perfection seen in Christ, that must set the standard. "I am come down from heaven, not that I should do my will, but the will of him that has sent me" (@John 6: 38). "My food is that I should do the will of him that has sent me" (@John 4: 34). "I do always the things that are pleasing to him" (@John 8: 29). That is the ark of God, the same character being reproduced by the Spirit in the saints.
Ques. How could it happen today?
C.A.C. It makes the government of God a serious matter with those who irreverently take the Supper and come under judgment. It is the natural element brought in where all should be spiritual. If the natural element enters in today it is sure to stumble. It is a warning to us how the most spiritual brother may through unwatchfulness displease God.
The new cart was a Philistine precedent copied without spiritual discernment. We may do the same thing without weighing over whether what we do corresponds with the will of God. The spiritual conditions lacking with David and Israel were found with a poor Philistine and he gets nothing but blessing (verses 13, 14). At the moment he took precedence over David and all Israel. This chapter does not close without showing us the supremacy of grace.
It is God's order that glorifies Christ. God's order is
{66}
always better than man's. The thought of the ark borne on the shoulders as we get previously is the ark carried in testimony, but here it is the progress of the ark to its proper place, but delayed on the way because of failure in the due order.
Rem. "Arise, Jehovah, into thy rest, thou and the ark of thy strength. Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness, and let thy saints shout for joy" (@Psalm 132: 8, 9).
C.A.C. That is beautiful. It is the full revelation of God in His Son brought to repose in the hearts of the saints, so that they are spiritually able to serve God. He has been declared by the Son "who is in the bosom of the Father"; there is no flaw in that declaration and the saints come into that. It requires to be learnt and we are left here to learn it and the spiritual order it requires. We are not left here to earn a living!
Rem. "But the hour is coming and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth; for also the Father seeks such as his worshippers" (@John 4: 23).
C.A.C. "God is a spirit: and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and truth". That is the climax. This chapter of Chronicles was written for our particular instruction tonight. But there are provisional stages; we do not get here the final climax, the ark was in the house of Obed-Edom three months and then in the tent pitched by David for it, before it was placed in Solomon's temple. We arrive at the full thought of God by stages. David took the hint and elevated this man to the peerage -- a poor Philistine turned into a Levite (chapter 15: 18). It was all to magnify grace, when all in Israel was missing its way, David and all, so that David resented God's way with him; but we have to accept it. It is wonderful to think that God should be pleased to reveal to a few poor good-for-nothings the secret of His
{67}
good pleasure in Christ, giving them intelligence bit by bit. We ought to be more intelligent every year. We learn by our failures. Through failure God taught David and all Israel important lessons. What interests me is that all Israel moves with David; they have all got the spirit of David, as a people who had said, "We are thy bone and thy flesh", but failed in their purpose for want of attention to divine order. Our great desire should be to please God according to His own pleasure. We should be quick to pick up the spiritual hints given in Scripture.
{68}
NOTES OF A READING @1 CHRONICLES 16
@1 Chronicles 16: 1 - 43
Ques. Is there any special significance in the sacrifices of the seven bullocks and seven rams in chapter 15: 26? Thousands of bullocks were offered by David, and when the ark is brought to the temple they are without number.
C.A.C. I think it is to make known to us that as a place is secured for Christ, and the Levites service that would bring Him in is helped of God, there is a spontaneous sacrifice to God in the matter -- a spontaneous movement in the affections of the people, encouraging us to see that if we are helped to secure a place for the ark, God will have a portion; which is indeed developed in the chapter we are reading this evening. The result of the ark getting its place is this wonderful psalm of praise to God as linked to the service of God in the assembly today.
Rem. I wondered if the bullocks and rams would be the intelligent service in the assembly, the spiritual result.
C.A.C. David represents believers who honour Christ, but need to be instructed to give place to what is priestly and levitical, so it answers very much to the position of many saints today. They desire by grace to honour Christ and find a place for Him, but there is the need of the priestly and levitical elements to be brought in; we need spirituality; devotedness to Christ is not sufficient. There are thousands more devoted than we are in this room, but they entirely miss the mind of God because they do not cultivate spirituality, and so are devoted according to their own idea. It is solemnly true
{69}
at this juncture that there is a good deal of devotedness, but also the need to cultivate spirituality, and there is not due attention given to Scripture and therefore no place secured for Christ according to the pleasure of God.
Rem. If a thing is taken up after the due order, God would help, and the intelligent offering would show it was understood.
C.A.C. And the recognition that all is based on the death of Christ, a full apprehension of that in the soul, that everything of value for God is based on the death of Christ. It grows upon us, so that every Lord's day there would be enlargement in our apprehension of what has resulted from the death of Christ. The assembly begins afresh on each Lord's day.
Ques. Has this a definite point in our morning meeting in its spiritual value?
C.A.C. Yes, I think so. As I understand it, the city of David represents a spiritual position secured on the ground of overcoming. It is a position that none of us secures without fighting for it, but when secured it is a place for Christ. David thinks of that -- a tent for the ark.
It is a provisional idea.
Rem. We suggested last week as to whether these things had not an assembly setting.
C.A.C. Christ is magnified in the affections of the saints so as to have a definite place there. He is brought in as the ark of God -- that is John: as the ark of Jehovah -- that is Matthew: and as the ark of the covenant -- that is Luke. It is not as the ark of the testimony (Mark) here; this is an inside matter. It is not a question of testimony here, but what the saints find for their own hearts in Christ.
Ques. Musical instruments and music generally seem to play a part in this scene. What is your thought as to that?
{70}
C.A.C. It intimates the joyful element in the scene. David added song; that is, there is great richness about the service, it is not cold doctrine but musical.
Rem. The note in the Darby translation has "transport" (chapter 15: 22), so that it is the delight and joy of the hearts of the saints.
C.A.C. It suggests the service being taken up in a definite and responsive way.
Ques. A bullock is the largest offering; a ram would typify devotedness and consecration, and there is the character of the burnt-offering in the seven bullocks and seven rams in verse 26, would you say?
C.A.C. Yes, the character of the offering is not specified but I would suppose that it was the burnt-offering.
Rem. There seems to be a kind of order in the thoughts. The character of the offering is not given here; the stress is on the sacrifice. In chapter 16 they presented burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and it says, "When David had ended offering up the burnt-offering and peace-offerings".
Ques. Is there not a distinction between the presenting and the offering up? In Exodus the offering is brought and then offered up as suitable for sacrifice.
Ques. Is this sacrifice of seven bullocks and seven rams more like what we get at the Supper, the glories of the Person who went into death -- not so much the great work done, as that in the light of His Person?
C.A.C. That is, God is glorified; there can be nothing greater than that. So it is a matter of continual exercise that our hearts should be enriched in the apprehension of Christ. We should look for it in the morning meeting that the Spirit should enlarge the apprehension of Christ to us, especially in those who take an audible part. And then the saints will get their portion; every one gets his portion in verse 3.
{71}
Ques. What are the three things there? -- and what place does David take here in ministering in this way?
C.A.C. I think it is the result of exercises worked out in the hearts of saints to their completion, not exactly the divine side, but as reached in the affections of the saints, what we have to take up. There is food and refreshment; it shows how well furnished the saints will be if God has His place. We come together having this thought of Christ having His place, and God being served acceptably; then we find out we are well furnished.
Ques. The service of God would not set our thoughts on ourselves, but what will Christ have as the ark, and what is there for God?
C.A.C. God engages our hearts with what is absolutely perfect; all we can dwell on in Christ is absolutely perfect. The psalm that David delivered is full of Jehovah.
Ques. Does the thought of David blessing the people and then dealing to everyone bread and wine and a raisin-cake suggest the Lord dealing support to His people in view of God getting His service, and owning it?
Rem. The bride in Canticles says, "Sustain ye me with raisin-cakes", in the presence of Christ. Is it not to support us in view of divine service?
C.A.C. It is really in view of our taking up the psalm. The ark is brought into its place, and God is ministered to, and the people are fed, refreshed so as to be able to take up the service of God.
Rem. It is striking in that way that Melchisedec brought forth bread and wine, and here something is added. It was not sufficient really. The raisin-cakes might be what would sustain us in power.
C.A.C. We all need support to sustain us; we cannot take up divine things without divine support. We need it to get any good from reading ministry; we need to pray
{72}
beforehand as needing support to profit from what comes before us.
Rem. Paul's prayer was that they might "be strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man" (@Ephesians 3: 16).
Ques. The Spirit is sparing of mentioning failure in this book, so why do we get Michal mentioned here?
C.A.C. I thought she was brought in to show that we must not expect any sympathy from the religious man for anything that makes much of Christ and gives Him His place, or what is due to God. We must not expect it.
Rem. Michal was looking through the window.
C.A.C. She was interested, looking on in a critical way.
What we find here is that every divine element moved together; the elders, the captains, the priests and the Levites all moved together as spiritual elements do.
Rem. Nothing is so unifying as putting the ark in its place.
C.A.C. And the ark of the covenant, the One in whom God has thoroughly committed Himself to us, and when we get hold of that there will be no shortage of praise.
Michal is put as a warning, as that element may come in. I wonder whether we understand quite the difference between the service of David and the service at Gibeon?
Ques. Will you please tell us?
C.A.C. It is evident that David saw to it that both aspects of the service were maintained. There were two services going on, the one before the ark, and the one at Gibeon. Evidently the one before the ark was the more spiritual service but did not set aside the Gibeon one.
Ques. Was it wrong?
C.A.C. No, it was right. I think it represents the public side. It is not exactly the same, but it is the service
{73}
of God on the public side. The service before the ark is service taken up on spiritual and heavenly ground, the spiritual service of the assembly. There is another public aspect of service, only of a temporary character, and soon going to cease.
Rem. David leaves Gibeon and goes to Jerusalem.
C.A.C. Yes, he gets spiritual promotion. I thought that the breaking of bread was at Gibeon.
Rem. "Ye announce the death of the Lord, until he come" (@1 Corinthians 11: 26).
C.A.C. And what goes on in the meeting publicly is Gibeon. The tabernacle service was in the wilderness; it was made for it and so suggests certain things are temporary. The breaking of bread is only temporary; it is not to go on a minute longer than the Lord intends, not a minute longer than when He comes. The woman is to keep silence in the assembly; that is the sort of thing that is temporary.
As we enter into the spiritual side, the public side should be enhanced. All that goes on in the meeting is to be comely and orderly, and belongs to Gibeon; but the city of David, and the ark there, is the spiritual side which we take up in power.
Rem. Like singing a hymn and going to the mount of Olives.
C.A.C. Yes. We come together to break bread; that is the wilderness, a temporary provision. Having broken bread we enter on the spiritual portion.
It is important to distinguish between the public side and the spiritual side. The more enhanced things are on the spiritual side, the more the details would be put right. If anyone said what was not true, what a blemish that would be in the public service.
{74}
NOTES OF A READING @1 CHRONICLES 21
@1 Chronicles 21: 1 - 20
C.A.C. I think this part of David's history is typical of the exercises of a believer, particularly the believer who is marked by having considerable light and a very considerable degree of spirituality. If there is anyone here who regards himself as being particularly spiritual and as having much light, this scripture has a particular bearing on that brother or that sister.
The house was to be built by the coming in of one who had the place of son (one of a suitable spirit -- not a man of war), that is, the house is connected with sonship as is always the case in the New Testament. Are we characterised by the spirit suitable to the house? God had to expose in David at this time a spirit working which was unsuitable. The same thing may be working in any one of us tonight. Are we characterised by not having the spirit of the house? David had greatly lost ground here as regards his spirituality; he was unduly severe in carrying out what was right (chapter 20: 3). Wrong has to be dealt with but it should be dealt with in the spirit of the house. I must confess I am not up to that, I am apt to be harsh and use hard language, but that spirit will not do for the house.
Though Satan is put forward here, God had in mind that David was to be developed in the spirit suitable to the house, and that is what God is after in every one of us, and He will take the most severe means, if necessary, to bring this about. The numbering was done in a wrong spirit, in a spirit of self-importance, a thing Satan can
{75}
always work on, and God allows it to be brought to light in order that it may be judged. "Bring the number of them to me, that I may know it", David said. He was not thinking of Jehovah at all, he was only thinking of his own self-importance. God will not have that spirit, he absolutely refuses to have it in His house. But when David acted in shepherd character in numbering, that was acting in the spirit of the house. It is very important to pray for the Lord's servants on that line, but we need to begin at home.
David's sin comes to light through Gad the seer. David at once realises the serious nature of his sin and he takes the blame on himself; that is the spirit for the house, and God is not going to leave any one of us alone till that has come to pass. It results in a much greater appreciation of Christ -- everything hanging on Christ.
Ques. Is it to develop the spirit of sonship?
C.A.C. Yes, so that David himself has to die in order that the son may come into view who would carry out everything that was for the pleasure of God; and all that was made known to David.
We have all to come to the threshing-floor where we learn to divide between the flesh and the work of God, the wheat separated from the chaff, and get the light of God's mind. All that comes out in the last chapters of this book shows that the wheat had been separated from the chaff, and it is connected with sonship. God's standard for us is sonship. David was a far more valuable man after the threshing-floor than before, and this is always the result of the threshing-floor, to develop spiritual value in the saints. It is beautiful to see this readiness of David; he shows no resentment at all under discipline. It was Gad and not Nathan here. Nathan could bring the prophetic word to bear on David's conscience, but Gad was David's seer. Seers see what God is at at any given
{76}
moment, whether individually or collectively, and what is going on in a spiritual way. Without a vision the people perish. It is beautiful as bringing out the effect on David's spirit, something comes out in him which is much greater morally than the failure. We are to look out for something much greater than what went on before the failure. The Lord is concerned that even the sense of failure may not weaken the saints. "I have besought for thee that thy faith fail not", He said to Peter (@Luke 22: 32).
David did just what he was told to do. That is the beautiful spirit that is to be admired and emulated.
A choice was given him of the kind of discipline. There were three days with Jehovah. David saw great spiritual results to be gained from those three days and quickly. We may count upon God to make quick work in regard of discipline; we should desire quick work. I think we can shorten God's discipline, it rests with us. Discipline is always a great advantage to us in view of the house. It is all to prepare us for going up to the threshing-floor where is the altar. It is great light. God had been talking about it for hundreds of years, but God had never indicated where He would place it till that moment. There is nothing more remarkable than that it was the altar of burnt-offering. David moves right over to God's side, and we must move over to God's side. It is a magnificent finish, and God answers by fire. It shows how God recognised and had never left the thought of the true spiritual value that was in David.
{77}
NOTES OF A READING @1 CHRONICLES 21 AND 22
@1 Chronicles 21: 18 - 30; @1 Chronicles 22: 1 - 5
C.A.C. It would be helpful to consider David and Ornan together as presenting to us great instruction in relation to the present service of God.
Ques. What is represented, would you say, by Ornan?
C.A.C. Well, I think we see the sovereign work of God in Ornan in its completeness without any complications incurred by his own experiences, for he is an unknown man.
Rem. He was a Jebusite.
C.A.C. I think the whole principle on which the house of God stands is brought out by Ornan, that is, the sovereign mercy of God. David judged his self-importance as sin and we know well we have to come to that point, and as soon as he reaches that point he has a seer -- Gad is particularly called David's seer (verse 9).
I doubt whether we come to the truth of the house without this. It is reached by the sovereign mercy of God, and we might all come into the thoughts of Christ by sovereign mercy. It is a point that brings us to all the thoughts of God at one stroke, is it not? So Ornan says, "I give it all". But David has to go through experience that brings him to it experimentally. He learns that everything he prided himself in is sin. And then we get the seer -- capacity to see things as God sees them. Gad -- what a lot of spiritual endowment we have which we have never utilised! It is a great thing when we appropriate to ourselves the power of seeing as God sees. He
{78}
is called "David's seer". We recognise that anything that gave us self-importance is judged. It is a great turning-point in the soul's history when we begin to think of others. David, instead of numbering the people in a vainglorious way, now calls them sheep and is ready to suffer for them; that is the only spirit that is of any good in the house.
The seer comes in when the conscience has been touched. David came to it: "I have sinned greatly". The seer gave him light as to the mind of God so as to understand this wonderful new place and position in which the blessed God is to be served. Have we the seer for this? We get insight into the way in which God would be served, it is a new principle with which we want to be well acquainted.
Ques. David seems to add the altar, not the house?
C.A.C. David identified the altar with the house; if you have the altar you have the house in principle; one simple divine element involves all the rest. It is wonderful! So Jacob had the same, but he saw the house of God in it. Though there is nothing to see yet, we can have the whole truth about the house in our soul.
Ques. Does it not suggest the greatness and value of the death of Christ in all this?
C.A.C. Well, surely.
When we have judged ourselves we get ability to see how God is approached and to think of others and see value in them and so be prepared to suffer for them. David had a deep sense of the divine value of this way of approach to God as we see in the six hundred shekels. Do we value the wonderful way of approach to God that has been opened up to us? Ornan valued the exercises of David but we are not told how he arrived at this.
Ques. How do we reconcile sovereignty and it reaching us experimentally?
{79}
C.A.C. We have to take account of both. In sovereign mercy we have redemption; we have been transferred from Adam to Christ in new creation, all on the ground of God's sovereign mercy. We have to take account of saints in that way. I am poor, I have few shekels, but we take account of the saints as "in Christ Jesus". You find the two lines coalesce. The experimental line is always humiliating; you never had an experience with God in your life that was not humiliating, while sovereign mercy brings you into things at a stroke. Ornan saw all that David saw. Ornan hides himself when he sees the angel, he disappears. He gets ability to contribute to the divine way. It was a great contribution, "the oxen for the burnt-offering, and the threshing-sledges for wood, and the wheat for the oblation", and he says, "I give it all". David had come to the divine measure of the thing, six hundred shekels of gold, and the weight of it is given. It represents a saint breaking bread, one who has come to the sense of a divine way of approach to God. He values the new movement throwing the old dispensation entirely into the shade. It was the most important moment in the history of Israel; God was giving light as to a new approach to Him all on the footing of sovereign mercy. Ornan shows you the gentile distinguished; it is really the mystery.
Ques. Is not this a beautiful coupling brought together?
C.A.C. I think that is interesting. It is new. That is what gives such exuberance to the morning meeting, because we are brought into it purely in mercy. So the threshing-floor of Ornan represents the great principle of sovereign mercy.
Rem. Solomon mentions mount Moriah (@2 Chronicles 3: 1).
C.A.C. This principle is carried through into the full
{80}
thought of God, so that however much we come into the light and blessing of sonship we come into it having the light of sovereign mercy; it is carried through. So we not only get sovereign mercy in Romans, but we get it in Ephesians.
Rem. Moriah means 'visions of Jah'.
C.A.C. Yes. This chapter is an illustration typically of a soul learning the truth of Romans and Galatians, getting free from the old system and coming into the liberty of the new position. It is as if God would say, 'Well, there is nothing here of you, everything here is of Me'. We never touch real liberty until we reach that, that everything that we stand in is of God. There is a pure product. I think we come here to do a bit of beating out so as to get rid of the chaff and get the pure wheat. The Jew is not great enough to fill God's house, you must have the gentile to fill God's house.
Ques. How are we to understand the action of Ornan's four sons?
C.A.C. It is suggestive that they have come to the same point morally as David had; they went out of sight in the presence of the destroying angel. But they come into sight again; the oxen are given.
Rem. It says David was afraid (verse 30). It is good to fear.
C.A.C. We ought to be afraid of the old system of things -- afraid to enquire at Gibeon, knowing what it is to be in the acceptance of the burnt-offering in the threshing-floor. And there is no linking on with the old system; it is discarded and David will not go back to it. We do not want a system that recognises man in the flesh, and the whole system of the religious world does. David represents the believer entirely delivered from the old system, and he is afraid of it. Solomon answers more to Hebron; the old system is brought spiritually into the
{81}
light of the new in the sonship of Christ. We have to do at the present time with a system entirely new, all of God, and it all centres in Christ and in the burnt-offering; it has nothing to do with man after the flesh. We can hardly understand what a new thing it was for God to set up an altar of burnt-offering in the floor of Ornan.
Ques. Why is it "burnt-offerings and peace-offerings" (verse 26)?
C.A.C. I think it shows how completely David has come over to the divine side. He has finished with the old and he sees a new system all of God and all subsisting in the value of the burnt-offering. We realise our spiritual unity when we come together, a brother says what is making you supremely happy, what is welling up in your own heart. He had no right after the old system, but there is no restriction whatever in the house; there is no silent brother in the house.
Rem. That is a difficult question.
C.A.C. I do not think so, because everyone is so happy.
Rem. Every one says "Glory" (@Psalm 29: 9).
C.A.C. There is not time for many but in the principle of it every brother's heart is ready. The principle of the house is liberty. All this is on the way to sonship which we get in the next chapter.
{82}
NOTES OF A READING @1 CHRONICLES 22
@1 Chronicles 22: 1 - 19
C.A.C. This, it is clear, is a chapter in preparation for the new order.
Ques. Why do you speak of it as a new order?
C.A.C. Because it stands in contrast to the old order in connection with the tabernacle, everything having broken down in connection with the old order. God began afresh on the principle of the sovereignty of His mercy, and the house was to be built in connection with that principle.
Rem. So the house and the altar are put in the first verse.
C.A.C. Yes, the fact that David had been accepted and his offering answered by fire showed he was accepted according to the new order and that the house was to stand in that connection.
Ques. There are only four instances in Scripture where God answered by fire, I believe, showing, would you say, that the offering was according to His own thought and desire?
C.A.C. Yes, God found pleasure in it. So that from this moment the whole book is a preparatory instruction in view of the house being fully set up -- so it is most important for us.
Ques. "Elohim" is added here. What is the import of that?
C.A.C. I suppose it is God known as in relation to men. Elohim by itself would speak of His creatorial power; but Jehovah Elohim is what He is in relations
{83}
with men, a very precious thing to think of. He loves to be in relationship to men, to have men near Him, and to have them in His own house on His own terms.
All that follows in this book is preparatory, and we must go through this course of education if we are to be near to God in His house and serve Him. This book was written for those who had returned from the captivity, so that it specially applies to us, for God had saints of the present period specially in view. It was intended for instruction for us if we have known what it is to come back from captivity. It is all based upon His own sovereign mercy, and what power is going to overturn that? So we have the selection of Ornan the Jebusite, whose ancestors should have been killed in Joshua's time, and David gets all "the strangers" -- it is all sovereign mercy. It is prophetic that God is going to give the gentiles a great place in His house. If that does not give us joy, I do not know what will! It should be imbedded in our souls that we have to do with God in sovereign mercy alone. We never had any promises or covenants, yet are given a place in His house. And the material is suitable, for if God is working on the line of sovereign mercy He must have suitable material; there is no limit to this preparation. Well, that is the way that God prepares for His house. It is not the finished product here, it is the material. Most of us are in the very early stages, not finished material.
But the thing is there in its completeness in the mind of God, and it is a complete thing in the mind of faith. There may be nothing to see, but faith is entitled to see the full thought of God. The saints are taken up sovereignly in order that they may be eventually a finished product to make up the house worthily. As far as I see, the wrought stones are the saints viewed from the standpoint of the divine calling. The Lord said, "Thou art
{84}
Peter" (@Matthew 16:18). He was a stone in the calling of God.
Rem. And you see how developed he was in the epistles.
C.A.C. So that the saints can be viewed in that light -- "Ye also are built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit" (@Ephesians 2:22). That looks at the saints as wrought stones brought into their place. We need this view. The calling of God had nothing to do with any behaviour on our part; God called us because He chose us. God has prepared the works beforehand in the light of Christ; you could not add anything. I do not know that I am authorised to do anything that Christ did not do.
I think it is very beautiful to see the Lord as the antitype of David preparing the material in the days of His flesh and after His resurrection. The eleven were all divine material, and hundreds of other saints.
Rem. And the strangers "from every nation of those under heaven" (@Acts 2: 5).
C.A.C. And it extends out to the gentiles in chapter 11.
Rem. "And I have other sheep which are not of this fold; those also I must bring" (@John 10: 16).
C.A.C. God's thought from the outset was to bring in the gentiles. Whether it was iron or brass or cedar wood, it all represents the kind of material suitable for the house.
Ques. What do the workmen represent?
C.A.C. The workmen represent those whom God has fitted to carry on this work. The apostles were all skilled men for the work of the house. It is all opened out in the succeeding chapters and developed in great detail, the order of the Levites and so on.
Ques. Why is only the burnt-offering mentioned?
C.A.C. I suppose that all is looked at from the divine
{85}
side; it is not a question of the sin-offering or the trespass-offering.
Rem. There is remarkable detail given, even the nails of the gates are mentioned -- the minuteness of it! I suppose Barnabas was a nail, opening the doors for Paul to come in.
C.A.C. It suggests the idea of things being firmly held together, which is an important thing.
If we think of Christ in His David character providing all the material -- it is without limit, He provides everything. All these things represent what the saints are brought to know of God through Christ; there is no other material. Look at the impressions the apostles got from the Lord Jesus, which they never forgot, and which entered into their service in the assembly. So that to ponder the gospels would form us very much for the house. We should get impressions of God through the Lord Jesus suitable to form a constituent part of God's house.
Rem. It is the house more on the side of God being served here.
C.A.C. I think it is service Godward that is in view; and how acceptable to God if we can bring in impressions of Himself that we have received through the Lord Jesus. His mediatorial service has not ceased; He is still ready to give us these impressions now, and continually. Then we get the great fact that the house can only be built as the thought of sonship is entertained.
Rem. When Peter said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God" (@Matthew 16:16), the Lord recognised at once the material for the house.
C.A.C. That exactly fits in with what we are saying. The house could not be built without the Son, and the thought in Solomon is not introduced in a mature way; you do not get that until the second book of Chronicles. I refer, of course, to the apprehension that the saints have
{86}
of Him; it is fully matured in Him, but not with them in apprehension. It sets forth that we do not come at once to the mature thought of Christ as Son. In the gospels we get two things, the thought of David collecting the material and also the thought of sonship, both here and there as set forth in Christ.
Rem. This is where Paul's ministry comes in.
C.A.C. You have not the mature thought of Christ in sonship till Christ was in glory. It was left to Paul, and with him you get the thought in maturity; it is not a "young and tender" thought.
Rem. So we do not get it until the return from the captivity.
C.A.C. Satan would connect His sonship with His deity. Scripture always connects Christ's sonship with His humanity and so brings us into it. None of us has the slightest apprehension of sonship till we see it in Christ. The apostles on the mount were told "THIS IS MY BELOVED SON" (@Matthew 17: 5). They learnt sonship first in Christ, and we all have to learn it first in Him. And at the end of that chapter He speaks of "sons" -- "Then are *the sons* free" (verse 26). You go, the Lord says, to the sea for a fish and give them something "for me and thee" (verse 27), that is, He puts Himself along with Peter in sonship -- it is beautiful! I do not think that we apprehend sonship until we see it in Christ, and hear Him say, "*For me* and *thee*". With most of us the thought of sonship is very immature; it is undeveloped, so we are just typically where Solomon is in this chapter, though we do not need to remain there. We all have, I suppose, some thought of it. Martha had some thought of it, "I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who should come into the world"(@John 11: 27), but very little.
Ques. But we need not be discouraged?
C.A.C. The Scriptures always comfort us; they
{87}
expose us, but they never depress us. If I have only begun, well, what a great thing that is. I have not come to stand, or kneel alongside the man in @John 9; he has reached the mature thought, it seems to me. So it is reached in suitable material; it is what I know of God that constitutes me such. "The greatest and precious promises, that through these ye may become partakers of the divine nature" (@2 Peter 1: 4). As we take in the promises and live on them we become so.
Rem. "Conformed to the image of his Son" (@Romans 8: 29).
C.A.C. That is the mature thought, not the "young and tender" thought. One of the first thoughts that I had when converted was, 'Man's thoughts never rise above service and God's thoughts never go below sonship', and I put it into my first preaching.
Rem. "We have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father" (@John 1: 14). Is that the mature idea?
C.A.C. I thought so, because John is writing as having come to the maturity of it all. He writes his gospel, "That ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God" (@John 20: 31). The whole gospel is written to bring us to a mature thought of the Son of God. It is a turning-point in the soul when it comes to look at Christ in relation to God. With the young convert it is different; he is full and rightly so of what the Saviour has done for him. But Christ stands in relation to God in the most blessed relationship of affection. If the house is built upon that, what kind of a place it would be! God's house is made up of people who have all come under the influence of sonship as set forth in Christ, and that determines our relationship with God though He has a distinction attaching to Himself, a glory about Him that will never be shared; but the position and relationship we share. We see what
{88}
saints have lost for many centuries through not apprehending the sonship of the Lord in manhood.
It is very touching that David has prepared all this in His affliction. I think that it was a suggestion that all the provision for the house is the result of the sufferings of Christ. You cannot detach any part of it from the sufferings of Christ. In Hebrews you get, "For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make perfect the leader of their salvation through sufferings" (@Hebrews 2: 10). It is through His afflictions that everything is brought in. It is like @Psalm 22, where you get the afflictions of Christ in a most profound way, and yet you get the results, "In the midst of the congregation will I praise thee". It is the house.
Rem. "Thou that dwellest amid the praises of Israel": He said that on the cross.
C.A.C. It was in His heart that the praises of God should be in the hearts and on the lips of His people, it is really the house.
Ques. At the end of the chapter all the princes are commanded to help; who are they?
C.A.C. They are those who are able to come into this blessed work and further it. It suggests ability in the saints really to help on the work in the house of God.
Rem. And it says God is with them.
C.A.C. Yes, what we find in the end of this book, and it is a very great chapter, is that all the people are brought into it with Solomon in that way, to offer willingly; and it results in one of the greatest ascriptions of praise to God found in the Old Testament. So we are all brought into it.
{89}
NOTES OF A READING @1 CHRONICLES 23
@1 Chronicles 23: 1 - 5, 24 - 32
C.A.C. In the previous chapter the thought of material is prominent, the preparation of material; but in this chapter and in the chapters that follow it is the thought of the personnel. It is quite clear that material without persons would not result in very much.
I suppose the effect of knowing Christ as David would be that we should be prepared to come under Him as Solomon. So that David at the end of his days, so to speak, hands over not only prepared material, but prepared persons.
Ques. It is significant that this takes place before David died, so that there is a kind of dual rule. What is the reason for that?
C.A.C. I thought it showed that David and Solomon must both be taken account of, one might say, at the same time. You see, David has to do with the subjection of contrary elements. All dealings with the workings of the flesh, for instance, do not come under Solomon at all; David has to do with that (and the Lord has to deal with it in us). The subduing of what is adverse belongs to David, not Solomon. Solomon is introduced, not in a mature way, but as young and tender, signifying the early apprehension of the soul as to Christ in sonship; therefore that element in the souls of the saints is to be helped and energised and strengthened, because in the apprehension of Christ as Solomon, as the Son of the Father's love, we are really prepared persons for the service of the house.
{90}
Rem. We get the "sons" of so-and-so repeatedly in this chapter.
C.A.C. Yes. I think the thought of sonship is introduced in Solomon, and the house is to be under Christ as Son, that is, His activities in lordship do not enter into it: in that He is dealing with contrary elements in you and me, and until subdued we cannot possibly take part in the service of the house. There is to be a subdued order of peace in which we can enter into service in divine completion.
This chapter is the Levite chapter, and the next is the priestly chapter. Unless contrary elements are subdued, we cannot possibly be Levites or priests. All in the house is under Christ as Son, Hebrews tells us; so that the great help given to the church in recent years as to the sonship of Christ has a direct bearing on the service of the house and is to prepare us for the service. Not only is material required but persons, so the next three chapters are full of names of persons -- material is not enough. It is all *here* in a certain sense, but we want it, not in the Bible, but in the saints. Take the hymn book, for instance, containing beautiful hymns of praise and worship; what is it worth without persons to *sing the hymns*?
Rem. "Set your heart and your soul" (chapter 22: 19).
C.A.C. Yes, that is *persons*. The first levitical service is viewed in a comprehensive way because it really includes what is priestly. "Twenty-four thousand were to preside over the work of the house of Jehovah; and six thousand were officers and judges; and four thousand were doorkeepers; and four thousand praised Jehovah with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith" (verses 4, 5). It requires persons.
Ques. Prepared persons, would you say, under the hand of David?
C.A.C. Yes; I think typically all these persons in these
{91}
chapters are prepared under the hand of David and ordered by him, though they are going to be continued by Solomon. It is most important and ought to be done quickly. With us it is often very slow work; but in this chapter all are subdued, so they can be officers and judges and use the instruments -- so they are all prepared servants. Yet Solomon's temple is nothing compared with what we have to do with today. I cannot take up anything that God has not prepared me for -- none of us can.
Ques. In the first verse, was this the maturity of him as lord?
C.A.C. I think his work, his subduing work, is finished, and all is to be handed over to Solomon -- to be under the blessed influence of sonship as seen in Christ. Of course, in our own history the two things overlap. There is a suggestion of the two. The authority of Christ as Lord, rebuking and subduing what is of nature, goes on with us all, but that is not quite the teaching of the type. Then when David comes to the end of his days the work is finished and persons are handed over as qualified. The thought of sonship runs through these chapters and certainly dominates the position with Solomon.
I think there must be the spirit of sonship in us to appreciate sonship in Christ, but God sets it forth in its perfection in Christ and we learn it there.
Ques. Our experience normally is to be under the lordship of David and then under Solomon?
C.A.C. That is the teaching. It will not help us much to see how much we have entered into it, but you want to see the teaching. So here twenty-four thousand qualified persons are over the work of the house. You get multiples of twelve, an important number with the Lord; He appointed twelve.
Rem. In the one hundred and twenty at the beginning
{92}
of Acts you get a multiple. They are qualified persons for the house.
C.A.C. In the time of the apostles, the elders carried out the responsibility; we all have to do it now. Of course, elder brethren have a responsibility that does not attach to younger ones, that is always true. None of the people contemplated here are novices, they are capable persons. The number twelve shows that order is a great matter in connection with the service of God. I think it is the thought of order -- nothing is left indefinite, at a loose end. The one hundred and forty-four thousand in @Revelation 7 and @Revelation 11 all carry the same thought of things set in divine order.
Ques. Should each have a definite service in the house?
C.A.C. I think so, the thought in the service of the house of God is that we know how to blend with others. Liberty in Scripture is always subordinated to order. "Let all things be done comelily and with order". So no one can plead liberty as an excuse for disorder.
Rem. "The perfect law, that of liberty" (@James 1: 25), is that it?
C.A.C. Yes. I think that is a very good illustration. These appointments were very important. There are six thousand officers and judges; that is the disciplinary element in the service; without that everything would go to pieces. Then the doorkeepers, there are four thousand of these; for lack of them the church has come to disorder today, and it has led to ruin in the church. And lastly there are four thousand "Who praised Jehovah with instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith". The Lord has made the instruments; no instruments are of any melody in the house of God but what Christ has made. Christ has made instruments that are suitable to the praise of God. Now, can we handle those
{93}
instruments? That is the question.
Rem. In @Colossians 3, "Let the word of the Christ dwell in you richly". That is the necessary preliminary before psalms, hymns and spiritual songs.
C.A.C. Quite so. I think that is it. You see the instruments of praise now are those that Christ has made, so that we are to take up the praise of God as brought out by the Lord Jesus. He has brought out the whole way in which God is to be praised, there is no room for innovations.
Ques. Is there a difference in blessing and praising, verse 13 and verse 30?
C.A.C. Yes, the praising would be Godward, and the blessing would be manward.
Ques. Would you say more as to the instruments -- is it apprehension of Christ?
C.A.C. I think the instruments of praise were made by Christ coming into manhood, taking up a place relative to God as Man, so that how He knew God and how He praised becomes the standard of praise. Nothing less than that would really be acceptable to God.
Ques. Is the praise a good deal the outcome of suffering?
C.A.C. Quite so; and the Lord has established the praises of God by His own suffering. I think @Psalm 22 would establish that; He was suffering with the praises of God in His heart, that they might come into human hearts.
At the end of the chapter it is interesting to see that God wants the younger brethren in His service; it is the final thing that David thought about. It is very important that the younger brethren should come into the service. If they wait now till they are thirty, the probability is they will never come into it. The service is so vast and marvellous in its extent that there is scope for everyone. I do
{94}
not think the Lord is pleased with a meeting where only old brothers take part. David strikes ten years off the limitation. We like to see the young men at the care meeting; how otherwise can they learn the character of the house of God?
The last addition he makes to the service is to lower the age to twenty years. It is put there to encourage the younger brethren to come forward in the service -- that is why it is put there.
Rem. In @Exodus 24: 5 the young men are mentioned.
C.A.C. Yes, and it is a feature that is very pleasing to God. It is what we need to be exercised about. The service cannot go on in divine order without young men.
Rem. And it is continually -- to stand every morning and evening to thank and praise Jehovah. It is a continuous thought therefore.
C.A.C. And he goes on to speak of the variety of the service. The levitical service is to be suitable to the priesthood, verse 28, and then he goes on to speak of it all in detail; it is most important to consider it.
Rem. It is rather interesting that "they cast lots ... . the small as well as the great, the teacher with the scholar".
C.A.C. That is the idea; Scripture is full of it; they blend together. The Lord sat on the ass and He sat on the colt; He would control both. All this is encouraging. Of course, the younger ones learn from the older ones, so that the older ones should serve with intelligence so that the younger ones can safely follow them.
Ques. Is there a change of service here?
C.A.C. It does not mean that the carrying service is over, but it is not the question here; that is another matter. A man cannot serve if he does not know how to carry through the wilderness so that what sets forth
{95}
Christ is not damaged. But all that is done with here; it is another character here. It would be all wrong for a man to serve in the house who was not right in the wilderness.
Ques. Why is it the family of Levi here?
C.A.C. I think because here it is the general thought of service in the house. The levitical is more general than the priestly family but the latter is included in it.
Ques. Would you say a word about the working out of the principle of courses in the service of God today?
C.A.C. Yes. It seems to me that the great principle of order entered into it. Each course had its day. I think it would suggest mutuality and the acceptance of responsibility. The danger is that we are content often to let others do the service, but that is not levitical. All are priests, are they not? Well, why should they not serve? God would encourage liberty in these matters and show the vast range of material over which we can travel in the service of God, the shewbread, the meat-offering, the unleavened cakes and that which is baked or fried. So there is something that any brother could take up. No brother could say, 'There is nothing for me to touch in the service of God'.
Rem. They would make progress in that way.
C.A.C. Yes, I think so. The shewbread would be the saints as before God in the life of Christ and therefore exceedingly pleasurable to Him -- a thought to enter the service whenever we come together, and so of the oblation, the fine flour; all this is to enter into the service, that is, that new and sinless life come into manhood.
It is an exhaustless theme, and God is never tired of listening to it brought out in praise. It is Christ and the Spirit apprehended objectively; it is "saturated with oil". God has given us the privilege of contemplating the Spirit objectively in Christ -- that which is saturated.
Rem. I do not quite understand.
{96}
C.A.C. In the blessed life of Christ you see the Spirit objectively; it was permeated with the Spirit.
We bring it before God, and how He loves to see us enter into it. Perhaps we say we cannot grasp it. Are we content not to grasp it? If so we are content to take the place of not being qualified. It is a great thing to contemplate the Spirit without any admixture. It would be mixed in me, so if you looked at me, you might be disappointed, but if you look at Christ, you will not be disappointed, you see manhood perfectly saturated with the Spirit. It is an essential part of His service; God loves to have that brought before Him.
There are three thoughts; the anointing, the mingling and the saturating with oil, and all three are in Christ. There you see a life anointed and mingling with the power of the Holy Spirit, and lastly there is the thought of saturation. He was saturated with the Spirit, so all He did and spoke was by the Spirit. Even in the resurrection He gave commandment by the Spirit.
Rem. There is the exhortation to "be filled with the Spirit" (@Ephesians 5: 18).
C.A.C. We ought not to put that away from us as an impossibility, being filled with the Spirit; it is a spiritual possibility. How pleased God is to have these things brought before Him in the revived affections of a levitical company who can appreciate them, our whole soul permeated by virtue of the things we say.
{97}
NOTES OF A READING @1 CHRONICLES 24 AND 25
@1 Chronicles 24: 1 - 31; @1 Chronicles 25: 1 - 8
C.A.C. What we were seeing in chapter 23 was how the service of the Levites blended with that of the priests, intimating to us, I suppose, that the ministry of the word is always to have in view to help what is priestly. I believe the Lord would have all those who serve in the ministry of the word to have this in mind, that whatever they may take up in their ministry, the thought in their minds may be to further the service of God in a priestly way.
Ques. God's blessing is in view of what is for God?
C.A.C. Yes. We find servants in the New Testament, teachers and prophets, men at Antioch, and it is said of them that "they were ministering to the Lord", they were characterised by the priestly element.
Ques. Would Paul and Timothy set out the thing in a practical way? Paul sent Timothy to various assemblies. Would they illustrate "the small as well as the great"?
C.A.C. Yes, quite so. It is good to see that that is the end in view with all service carried on in the house of God. It is the end of all the service spoken of in the two epistles to Timothy, which are levitical in character. All has in view that the priestly service should be in order.
Ques. Is that why the sons of Aaron are to be divided with the sons of Levi in a detailed way?
C.A.C. God would impress on us that great matter at the present time, the carrying on of His service.
Rem. The sons of Levi were to unite with the sons of Aaron in that way.
C.A.C. There is a happy blend, all is co-ordinated
{98}
and ordered in these chapters. Every discord is eliminated and all are working harmoniously with the thought in view that the great service of God can go on.
Ques. Their place was sovereignly ordered?
C.A.C. We should all feel that we are committed to this matter. Room is made for the chief of the fathers, and for all the brethren, as well the small as the great. There is room for all to come into this matter, room for the youngest and smallest of us.
Rem. It is good to see that a place is allotted to the smallest -- *their place*.
Ques. How do we acquire priestly instincts and ability?
C.A.C. Do you not think that the Lord gives exercise to His servants, even to take up their service in a priestly way? Paul says, "God ... whom I serve in my spirit" (@Romans 1: 9). He was really in a priestly state, serving God. I suppose that in preaching Paul would have the same thought that he was ministering to God in the way that he preached. "We are a sweet odour of Christ to God, in the saved, and in those that perish" (@2 Corinthians 2: 15).
We are led on as we are able to see that the great thing is to minister to God. Paul says, "Carrying on as a sacrificial service the message of glad tidings of God, in order that the offering up of the nations might be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit" (@Romans 15:16). He is looking for the result for God; that seems the priestly touch.
Rem. I was thinking of Dorcas; she seemed to limit her work to what was levitical; then she died and after that the spiritual element comes in.
Rem. I thought we got a priestly touch in the sense of our relations to the true Aaron. It is an inheritance in a way, is that right?
Rem. I wondered if we were free to serve in this way
{99}
until moral questions are settled with us, and whether we can be on the level of priestly service until we are in the good of sonship?
C.A.C. This is the divine thought, that all that is levitical is to contribute to what is priestly. And all is set in order here, the ordering of things is in view of the house being built. We get the priestly family, of course, in chapter 24, the divisions and courses of the sons of Aaron. And we find amongst them those spoken of as "heads of fathers houses" and "princes of the sanctuary and the princes of God" in verse 5, i.e. the thought of those who are personally qualified to give a lead in the priestly service. I think all these elements are in the mind of God to come into view in each local assembly.
Rem. It is a helpful principle to see the mind of God first, and then to see how that is developed.
C.A.C. With Asaph we come back from the twenty-four courses of the priesthood to think of the service of song.
Ques. Could you help as to "casting lots"?
C.A.C. Yes, the twenty-four courses have their position in the service assigned by lot; there is no self-choosing. We have to work along with the priesthood in its universal aspect, to take up our assigned place in relation to the universal service of God in a priestly way.
Ques. Does the lot not involve divine choice?
C.A.C. It is the principle of the service that everything is ordered, it is an ordered system.
Ques. There were more sons with Eleazar than with Ithamar?
C.A.C. Yes, the principle of sovereignty gives a greater place to some than to others.
Rem. No one gift is to predominate.
C.A.C. And all are related and correlated in divine wisdom. You see, the thought of courses has been quite
{100}
lost sight of in the religious world; you get one person carrying on the service. But God has recovered it. So that each member of the holy priesthood is to function in his day, that is, there is room for it. The Lord has been teaching us that the reduction of the size of the meeting makes it easier for the priestly courses to function.
Rem. In the beginning of Luke we get a priest fulfilling his course.
C.A.C. Yes, it says "He fulfilled his priestly service before God". Are *we* in our divinely allotted place? It is a question for us to raise for ourselves.
Rem. There is perfect blending, "One with another". It puts both together as "Princes of the sanctuary" and "Princes of God".
C.A.C. Naturally there might be some kind of feeling of jealousy, but spiritually there was none; they work in harmony. It is good to see the order in the house, even if we see it only in a small way; each course taken on as the other has finished.
In the assembly each brother should go on with the course where the other has finished, and the next after him and so on. I think that is the divine idea. So there is the progress of the service, until the whole spiritual year is accomplished in that way.
Rem. That would avoid repetition.
C.A.C. I doubt very much if repetition is pleasing to God in the assembly; we should move on in the service.
Ques. What of the separation of the priests for prophecy?
C.A.C. The military side comes in here. All that is done in a militant way is intended to be developed into the service of song. The faith has to be earnestly contended for (@Jude 3). It is all that the service of song should be enhanced. The Reformation and whatever conflict for the truth there has been results in that.
{101}
Rem. You may get a victory as in Exodus or defeat as in the end of Samuel, but both lead to song.
C.A.C. The great revival of the truth as to Christ and the assembly resulted in a marked change in the service of song; hymns were written in the last hundred years such as were never written in the church before.
Rem. A good soldier would have the service of song before him.
C.A.C. No one contended for the truth like J.N.D., and no one contributed so much to the service of song; and all that grew out of the militant character that great servant had to take up in the conflict for the truth. We sang one of his songs tonight. I think that is the principle, and we should get on to that side of it, not considering that the conflict wastes time but thinking of what has come out of it. The conflict regarding the sonship of Christ has resulted in greater praise.
Then the thought of prophecy is very interesting, as in chapter 25: 1, 2 and 3, showing that the element of prophecy comes in in connection with the musical service.
I think the word "Direction" is very good. The Lord is Director of things. It is not headship, but more as Son over God's house. Everything is at the hand of the king through Asaph, and I think we need that. I think the Lord is seen very much as Director at the end of Luke; it is not exactly lordship or headship, but the Lord directing. I think the Lord has to direct us, so as to bring us into harmony with Himself, before He can come in as Head. It is a service on the mediatorial side which magnifies God and so directs us that we come into harmony with Him. Asaph was the director. Indeed, the very word is used in @2 Thessalonians 3: 5, "The Lord direct your hearts into the love of God". I think it is a principle that we must accept, that He can direct us into
{102}
harmony with Himself.
Ques. First under the hands of Asaph and then at the direction of the king?
C.A.C. It is the principle of direction, and, of course, the Lord may use a brother that would direct us; He would use a word perhaps in the assembly. We need directing into the love of God and His thoughts. As Mediator, He directs us into the things of which He is the Mediator.
Then the principle of prophecy enters into it. In the most exalted service of the assembly this should have a place. Here, in what is addressed to God, is an element designed for the formation of the assembly. So that one taking part with his spirit ministers to God, but he should do so with his understanding also, so that the saints are helped, so that there is a prophetic element in it that helps the saints.
Rem. That makes two meetings!
C.A.C. This is the most refined and elevated character of service that we have, and the element of prophecy comes in, so that not only God gets something, but the saints too, this prophetic element adding to our knowledge of God, on the formation side, so that we are increased in our knowledge of God. Take `12:1, what a prophetic power there is in it. Who could sing it without being enlarged in the thought of Christ where He is and there for His people, and the priestly service of God? So there is something additional brought in: so that we get a touch of God we did not have before. It is in that character.
"All these were sons of Heman the king's seer in the words of God, to exalt his power" (chapter 25: 5). It is not exactly God speaking to us, but words spoken that make much of God and the people of God; that is on the Ephesian line. Heman magnifies God. It is what we say
{103}
to God -- "the words of God". I think perhaps we have lost the sense of the things that are presented in this chapter; direction and this element of prophecy entering into the service of God.
Rem. Saul prophesied.
C.A.C. The effect of prophesying in divine power is to make other people prophesy. So a prophetic word in a meeting stimulates another good prophetic word.
The prominent thought when we come together in assembly has in view the service of divine Persons, but it has this thought of prophecy brought into it; so the morning meeting ought to edify us more than any other meeting.
Ques. How do instruction and skill enter into it (verse 7)?
C.A.C. I suppose it is the working out of the thing. "Twenty-four thousand" represents the assembly in its highest privilege of service, and all are represented as instructed and skilful.
Ques. Would it correspond with the prayer in @Ephesians 3; the divine power is reflected in the saints?
C.A.C. The thing is presented in its ideal perfection first, and then there is a verse to encourage us so that the smallest one could come in (verse 8). If the apostle Paul were present he would not say anything that would not be true for the youngest. You get the prophetic touch in @Ephesians 5: 19: "Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs". It is the prophetic side of the matter.
We may have a harp or lute, or a cymbal; there are different grades of service. The harp calls for the greatest skill. There are some hymns that the feeblest brother can enter into, and others need spiritual maturity. There is a united service in singing a hymn. It is a wonderful thing, a company of persons come up from the wilderness, and
{104}
so coming under the hand of the Lord, His direction and then His headship, that they can sing together to God! It moves heaven.
We get hopelessly formal; we need to enter in our affections into our singing. Fifty or sixty persons blending in their singing, magnifying God and His love -- why, it would be a little bit of heaven let down into the sordidness of this world!
{105}
NOTES OF A READING @1 CHRONICLES 26
@1 Chronicles 26: 13 - 28
C.A.C. These five chapters 23 - 27 are full of instruction, particularly as to service; so they are to be much pondered by those who wish to have part in the service of God. We get the priestly service, and the levitical service, and there is the general service.
What we come to tonight is the service of the doorkeepers. We were considering the singers last week, and it is noticeable that there were just as many singers as doorkeepers, four thousand of each, indicating that the service of song requires to be accompanied by the service of doorkeeping.
Ques. Is that to safeguard the service of song?
C.A.C. I thought so; this service must necessarily go alongside the service of song, and it is perpetual service, not something that acts once and is done with. Every time an Israelite came up to worship he came under the scrutiny of the doorkeepers. It would be linked up with the power to discriminate, especially as the doorkeepers evidently kept watch that there should be suitability to God in whoever approached Him; not whether it was a rich or a poor man, or whether he had qualifications recognised amongst men; that would not enter into their considerations at all, but was he suitable to enter into the service of God?
Ques. Can that be applied as a principle today, and how?
C.A.C. It not only may be applied, but it must be applied!
{106}
Rem. I wondered if it could be applied to each one of us individually? "Let a man prove himself, and thus eat" (@1 Corinthians 11: 28).
C.A.C. I think that is very good. It refers to the principle of holy watchfulness that applies to the service of God. So the persons are scrutinised all the time, and I do not think there could be any house of God without that. It is not only what sort of person comes into fellowship, but this comes in continually, it is the principle of holy vigilance in what concerns God.
Rem. "I will be hallowed in them that come near me" (@Leviticus 10: 3).
C.A.C. That is very helpful. I think the principle is seen in action in @Hebrews 12: 15: "Watching lest there be any one who lacks the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and many be defiled by it; lest there be any fornicator, or profane person".
It says you are to be on the watch that no evil thing come in. "They watch over your souls, as those that shall give account" (@Hebrews 13: 17).
It is a general principle now that there is a care meeting. The care meeting involves doorkeeping; it is to keep a careful watch that there is nothing contrary to God. If that is not it, I do not know what is!
Rem. It is not merely for accounts!
C.A.C. The great subject of care in the house of God is persons.
Rem. And not only the persons, but what they might bring in with them. Energy and often courage would be needed in the care.
C.A.C. Yes, it would take some courage in some of these men to speak plainly to someone who wanted to approach unsuitably, and say, 'You must go and wash your robes before you come in here'. But it would have to be said; it is part of the service. We did not come into fellowship
{107}
with the expectation that every part of it was going to be easy, did we? And this principle would be specially seen as exercised by the elders in the apostles time, and in our day in the care meeting. The principle of care is to be exercised by every one of us, that the assembly and every individual member of it is suitable to the service of God.
Rem. We need faithfulness in pointing out what is unsuitable.
C.A.C. I plead guilty to having little courage, but that does not excuse me. You see, when the Lord was here, many things had a footing in what He spoke of as His Father's house, but then He dealt with it; that is the principle.
Rem. Paul called the elders together in @Acts 20. He said, "Shepherd the assembly of God" (not feed) and "Watch". Is that the principle?
C.A.C. It is "The assembly of God, which he has purchased with the blood of his own". It is as much as to say He is entitled to it on the ground of purchase, and who is going to be bold enough to rob Him of it? We see that the service of song needs to be balanced by the service of doorkeeping.
Rem. It is easier to speak to God about people than to speak to them directly.
C.A.C. That is just where courage is needed in the service of God. It is perhaps a more important element in the service than we have been apt to think.
Rem. So that one coming up to the gates would expect to be scrutinised.
C.A.C. And that would lead to a wholesome fear, would it not? This would not only bear upon the service of song, but also upon the care of the treasures and of the dedicated things which followed.
Ques. Would you link the care meeting with every
{108}
gate? This function was exercised at the gates.
C.A.C. Yes, and every gate was furnished.
Rem. It would be a place of counsel and judgment, each gate, not to be exercised by one person only but it would be of general application to be effective.
C.A.C. Quite so. We are all in responsibility in regard to it, for we do not want the service of God to suffer.
Ques. Would the casting of lots show the necessity of divine choice?
C.A.C. Yes, and it is a principle that runs through the service; it is all a matter of divine assignment. It is a principle that we have to accept in connection with divine service.
Rem. The Lord has the disposing of the lot (@Proverbs 16: 33).
C.A.C. There is no mistake about the divine assignment of service. We have just to accept the position of service in which we are set.
Rem. The gates suggest that the service would be in our own locality.
C.A.C. So that this service is universal; there are four gates. The service of song and the service of doorkeeping is universal; and then we find that there is need for this care in view of the treasures in the house of God. It is a house furnished with treasures, which is a thought not much developed in Scripture until we come to this portion. They are to be conserved with great care.
Ques. To be kept there and not to go outside?
C.A.C. They are to be kept there and not to be diminished, these treasures, which are distinguished from the holy vessels. The treasures I should take to be what has taken form in the souls of the saints. The holy vessels of the sanctuary represent the divine side, things that are true in God and true in Christ; but the treasures represent something in addition to that. You see there is no
{109}
possibility of increasing what is on the divine side. You could not increase the ark, or the mercy-seat, or the table of shewbread, or the altar of incense. But when you come to the treasures, there is possibility of increase, and we all want to be in it.
Rem. "And I will fill their treasuries" (@Proverbs 8: 21).
C.A.C. Then they become capable of addition. Certain things are made good in the saints in relation to their affection and spiritual understanding, and this is just as great a reality as what is made good in Christ, and these are the treasures in the house. The possibility of expansion on that side is unlimited.
Rem. "Which thing is true in him and in you" (@1 John 2:8).
C.A.C. Yes. The New Testament Scriptures were written by men who had the substance of the things in their souls. It was all in John's soul before he put it down in his gospel and epistles. It is what is inwrought in the saints; and how important to conserve that.
The dedicated treasures are an advance. You get the treasures in verses 20 - 22, and then the dedicated treasures follow. So you find such a brother as Saul or Joab, that he turns out to have had something more than you expected! We come across a brother like that sometimes. A man may end his course badly; Joab and Saul ended badly, under the judgment of God, and yet they left something to be preserved. We have some hymns written by those who have gone out; they are among the dedicated things. They are the spoils of conflicts, acquired through taking part in the testimony.
Ques. Should everyone acquire something through conflict?
C.A.C. In every controversy and conflict that arises in relation to the truth there is a gaining side and a losing side. If on the divine side, there is great gain, if not, there
{110}
is loss; so that those who miss their way in times of controversy go back altogether and seem to lose what they had. But those who go on with God get spoil that can be brought into the house of God.
Ques. The names of these men might suggest something?
C.A.C. Samuel represents a spiritual man who finished his course with joy. Joab and Saul finished badly, but they left something that was of equal value with the dedicated things. This would have a special bearing on the conflict of the last days. The battle for the testimony during the last hundred years has yielded permanent treasure, and it is part of the service of God to see that none of it is lost. No one is competent to serve God intelligently today who does not understand the conflicts of the last hundred years.
We are to take account of the treasures and dedicated things. It is a great thing to take account of the work of God in His people. The treasures would be rather what the saints know of God as revealed in Christ, what has taken form in the saints. We can see it clearly in the beginning; what wonderful things took form in the souls of the apostles before the New Testament was written, what took form in the minds and souls of those favoured men.
Rem. The introduction of the dedicated things is by king David and the chief fathers and the captains in verse 26, king David being in the lead.
C.A.C. Showing that it is a military matter, and that comes down to every one of us. Suppose we have to contend for any part of the truth, to contend earnestly for the faith; it pays very well to contend for it, for you get much more established in the faith than you were before.
In recent times I suppose that no one engaged in so many conflicts as J.N.D., but then look at the spoil that
{111}
came out; every error met brought out the truth more clearly than before.
Rem. 'The Sufferings of Christ' was spoil that came out as a dedicated thing.
C.A.C. Yes, we ought to think of the wonderful working of God that has brought out this spoil through His servants, and we ought not to let it be stolen or damaged. It is to be held in every locality, and I think that is what comes out in chapter 27. We find that everything is under divine control and there are storehouses in every village, which would suggest local assemblies. What we find in chapter 27 is the detail of the management of king David, the divisions; it is typical of all the service which comes under the Lord. In @1 Corinthians 12 there are "Distinctions of services, and the same Lord". I believe that covers chapter 27, everything is looked after. I suppose if we took up the truth as set forth in I Corinthians, we should find everything is provided for and looked after. They were not in the good of it, but it was there, and Paul wrote that they might come into the good of it; and it is for us to come into the good of it now, and see that all the servants are under the same Lord.
Rem. It speaks of great wealth generally, oil and wine and herds. It seems to cover the whole inheritance.
C.A.C. Yes, it does.
{112}
NOTES OF A READING @1 CHRONICLES 27
@1 Chronicles 27: 25 - 34
C.A.C. I thought it would be instructive to distinguish between the service by courses, which has occurred mostly in these last five chapters, and the service in a departmental way which comes before us in the verses read. I think we need the instruction; it would be simple if we did not, but I think we can see how important it is in relation to the working out of the thoughts of God in the assembly.
Ques. Would you open up your thought as to departmental service? Does it apply to service today?
C.A.C. I think it is important to recognise that the Lord's matters and service are distributed, that each one has to take up his own department and not be diverted from it by occupation with what others may have to do; he must get on with his own part. But it is important before we come to that side of things that we should understand the bearing of serving by courses: it is obvious there was no variety in the service. It was taken up by different courses; twenty-four courses of priests and twenty-four of Levites and the twelve courses in relation to the king's matters, but in each case it was one service, there was no variety in the service, for in all service Godward there is uniformity, it is universally the same.
Ques. Just as the offerings were uniform in @Numbers 7?
C.A.C. Quite so, whatever one course of the priests had to do in its service, each other course had to do, the service was precisely the same. It passed into many hands;
{113}
the vessels of service were named and came in rotation, but the service was exactly the same; and everyone in the holy priesthood was competent to take part in it. It is very important that we should have that in our minds.
Ques. Is it an obligatory service?
C.A.C. Well, of course it is. The holy priesthood was called to take it up. At the same time it is an immense privilege. In the service of the assembly all know God in the same way. There is not the slightest variation in the way the saints know God. All the saints know Him as revealed in Christ. There is perfect unity in the fact that they all have the Spirit of sonship by which they cry, "Abba, Father". There is positive unity so that it is one service wherever it goes on; and it goes on in courses and does not depend on one or on a few, but is committed to the holy priesthood. Now, I wish the brothers would help; this is a great subject.
Rem. @Ephesians 4: 13 would bear on this.
C.A.C. This is simple foundation truth spoken of here. I am thinking of the character of the service of God and the unity of it.
Rem. It is the way in which all the saints are set in the light of the Father, not how far we have moved.
C.A.C. These types present the thing as it is in the mind of God, and to see what is in His mind helps us because it is true for all saints.
Rem. They followed the instructions.
C.A.C. Yes, actively. Everyone in the holy priesthood is ready for his turn in the service. There is no thought suggested in Scripture that there should be a holy priest not ready to take his turn. That is God's thought of the holy priesthood -- it is not a one-man matter or for a few -- it is a beautiful conception of the priesthood. And, of course, this applies in principle to sisters just as much as to brothers. They are to be silent in the assembly, but
{114}
they are not silent because not taking part or not ready. Every sister must be ready for the service. One of the greatest and best priests in the New Testament is a woman, and an old one too. She departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day -- that was the service.
Now we are all to be in trim for the service. I would repeat it, we should all, brothers and sisters alike, be ready for the service. In the assembly at one particular moment one brother expresses audibly what is in the hearts of all, in every sister's heart and every brother's heart.
Ques. While we should be available, there is some part of the service for each, would you say?
C.A.C. It is to be carried out in liberty; everyone is free. Each one is perfectly free to take part at any moment in the service, that is the divine conception.
Ques. It says earlier that they were with the king for his service; is that it?
C.A.C. Yes, they were available, and we should all be ready when our turn comes, every brother should be ready to voice what is in the hearts of all. It is in his heart; he would not be a brother if it is not. Why does he not express it? He has not to manufacture it or make pretty words, and it is inside every other heart.
Rem. "That ye may with one accord, with one mouth, glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ" (@Romans 15: 6).
C.A.C. That is exactly what I had in mind. Romans is an elementary epistle; the Spirit of sonship is in every heart, and it is not silent, that is, we cry "Abba, Father". It is not a silent thing, it is a cry, and on that ground with one another we can glorify God, so it is a unity of service taken up in courses. The thought of courses enters into the service of God in its highest character.
{115}
We have often remarked that this book is written for remnant times, showing how the greatest thoughts of God can be taken up and worked out in remnant times. There is competency for service in every member of the priestly service. The devil would like to make us believe that we are incompetent. If we have the Spirit of sonship we are competent, that is, normally speaking, when walking uprightly. The thought is that the sons are all free and all competent. I have it in my heart and every brother and sister has; who is going to voice it? I ought to be eager to be the one.
Ques. Would @1 Corinthians 12 give the order?
C.A.C. That comes in with the departmental service, for @1 Corinthians 12 is differing, and we must understand what it is to be all alike. In @1 Corinthians 1 you get "Those sanctified in Christ Jesus", that is unity, and the Lord's supper in chapter 11, which unifies the saints, but in chapter 12 you come to the different services of the Spirit allotted to each one, what belongs to him personally. This is hardly the direct service of God, but each individual takes up his own department and fills it out. I think practically we begin with the assembly, where we are all in the presence of God for service, but we are all alike; all appreciate the precious and adoring thoughts that come into my heart. Well, I will get up and express it; is that not how it works?
You do not say anything that is your own in the assembly; what you say is in each heart -- the outshining of God's love and His purposes and counsels. I do not know why we "come together" otherwise. I think that the priestly touch enters into every service, into preaching for instance. It is manward and Godward. Every word that Paul spoke went up as a sweet savour to God.
We are still restricted, partly because souls are not in liberty, not really free, but bound about with grave-clothes.
{116}
The bonds of the religious world are more hampering than we think, the thought of one man only taking part, instead of thinking, I have to carry it on. It does not follow that every brother takes part in every meeting, but the divine thought is that every one is available to take part, and all in liberty. When we have eaten the Supper and the Lord has His place, it is found that we are all alike, if you could look into every heart.
Ques. "To each one of us has been given grace" (@Ephesians 4: 7); is that the departmental thought?
C.A.C. Yes, because grace is given to work it out, and then he goes on to speak of gifts, they differ -- that is departmental. You begin the week with the assembly, and then the departmental service is taken up in the light of the circle where all are alike, where all are in the liberty of sonship. It is important in the way of God getting His part. None of us are mere listeners but all taking part. Priesthood is dependent on sonship, so that priests are intelligent and would know what part of the service is requisite next, and that is a check on brothers, for the sisters know what should come next and if I give out unsuitable hymns they are all sorry.
There is a further part of the teaching in the earlier verses of chapter 27. What you find is that there is the service of the king in every matter, and there are twenty-four to took after it. This is not exactly priestly or levitical service, but giving attention to work connected with the king. There were twenty-four thousand for this, and there would be equal faithfulness, for it would be a question of fellowship and maintaining what is due to the Lord. We are all committed to it. There are twelve courses in regard to this service. Twelve and twenty-four are universal numbers, so I think any particular course would represent any particular local assembly. Now we are all alike on that footing.
{117}
Rem. "God is faithful, by whom ye have been called" (@1 Corinthians 1: 9).
C.A.C. Yes, and therefore we have to be faithful to maintain what is connected with the fellowship. The courses go right round, and we are to be ready to take our turn in anything that touches what is due to the Lord.
Rem. Lydia was judged "to be faithful to the Lord".
C.A.C. Yes, she is a model for all. It applies to every saint. If any matter has to be dealt with for the honour of the Lord, we are all in it, every sister as well as every brother.
Ques. Who do the rulers over these divisions represent?
C.A.C. It is all a matter of order. Practically the princes give a lead in these matters, but then everyone must take his share in it.
Rem. "We beg you, brethren, to know those who labour among you, and take the lead among you in the Lord" (@1 Thessalonians 5: 12). They would be the rulers.
C.A.C. Yes, I thought so. These courses represent things in which we all have our share and should be prepared to take our turn. It may be painful or distressing, but I must be prepared for it if it is my turn. I think it all helps us to take up our individual service, and each one his own particular department.
The knowledge of these principles would preserve us from taking up any department of the work which would interfere with unity. All the different officers are members of one body (@Romans 12: 4), so they do not bring in any element of division, but co-operation.
Ques. What are the king's treasures?
C.A.C. We all know that the Lord has great treasures. There are all these departments which tend to enrich and magnify the Lord Jesus Christ.
{118}
Rem. Archippus was told, "Take heed to the ministry ... that thou fulfil it" (@Colossians 4: 17).
C.A.C. Yes, we need exercise as to whether I know what department the Lord has set me in. I ought to know. The Lord would be very pleased to let me know and then we should go on with it diligently (@Romans 12: 7, 8). Find out your part and go on with it. It would save us from independency if we began with a spiritual understanding of the courses; then we should not bring in any element of discord.
Ques. Why are Ahithophel and Joab mentioned among them?
C.A.C. I think to show the whole matter is viewed from the divine side. They both fell out of their department, as many have done. They had selfish motives working which took them out of the unity of the service. So there is a warning that we should know what our department is and go on diligently with it. It is very important that we should understand how to work according to the courses first, and then take up our departmental service in the light of that, and then it will always harmonise and never conflict with what other brethren are doing.
{119}
SERVICE BY COURSES AND BY OFFICES
(Notes of an Address)
@1 Chronicles 23 - 27
It will be found helpful to consider the difference between two kinds of service which are clearly distinguished in the appointments of king David. In @1 Chronicles 23: 6 it is written that David divided the Levites into courses, of which there were twenty-four courses of the sons of Aaron. These composed the priestly family. There were also twenty-four courses of Levites (@1 Chronicles 25: 8 - 31). Both the priests and the Levites served in relation to the house of Jehovah. Then there were also twelve courses of chief fathers and captains of thousands and their officers who served the king month by month throughout the months of the year (@1 Chronicles 27:1 - 15). And, in addition to those who served by courses, another class was composed of men who served in certain distinctive offices which were permanent, and did not pass from one to another (@1 Chronicles 27: 25 - 31).
We need to understand the teaching of all this if we are to serve God intelligently and in an orderly way, as He intends us to do. It would be generally admitted that believers have been saved that they might serve, and yet there is a great deal of uncertainty and much time wasted, because many have a very vague idea of how they ought to serve. Many dispose of the responsibility
{120}
by assuming that others are better qualified to serve than they are, but according to the truth no one is better qualified to do my part in the service than I am. People in the world speak of what is called the 'inferiority complex', which describes a morbid tendency to underrate one's own abilities. It is quite possible to suffer from this tendency in a spiritual sense. No doubt some overrate themselves, and go beyond their true measure in self-confidence and by the use of natural ability. But I believe it is a more common failure to hold back from doing what ought to be done on the ground that others can do it better. But consideration of the service as it is set before us in the Scriptures would help us all into greater liberty.
To begin with, it should be recognised that each believer having the Spirit is one of the holy priesthood, and is qualified to serve in a priestly way, and that this service Godward is the same universally. Each of the twenty-four courses of the priesthood had to carry on in its turn the same service; all were equally qualified for it. It is evident that, according to the truth, the same knowledge of God as revealed in Christ is in the heart of every saint. And the Spirit of sonship is in every heart. These precious divine realities qualify every believer for priestly service. I am not thinking, for the moment, of how souls may be darkened by bad teaching, or damaged by unfaithfulness. I am speaking of normal conditions according to the truth of the glad tidings, and assuming the maintenance of holy conditions. The teaching of the "priestly" courses is that the whole priesthood is qualified to function, and each member of it is to be ready to take his turn. It is the same service universally, though distributed in "courses" which bring the service into many different hands in many different localities. The divine thought is that the service does not depend on
{121}
one, or on a select few, but each one of the holy priesthood is qualified and at liberty to take his turn in it. It is to be desired that this should come more and more into evidence, so that it may be manifest that all the sons are free. It is a matter of freedom in the affections and in spiritual intelligence. Of course saints will not be free if they have not received the Spirit of sonship; and many are not free because they are bound with grave-clothes; they are trammelled by thoughts and habits which they have acquired by contact with the religious world.
Every brother and sister is one of the holy priesthood, and is competent in spirit to fill his or her part in the service. All are spiritually in liberty and there is one accord, one mouth, to glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. All can say, 'Abba, Father', in the Spirit of sonship. The sisters do not speak in the assembly, but they have part in the priestly service. Spiritual sacrifices are brought in their hearts, and all that is audibly expressed by the brothers derives substance and volume from what is present in the intelligent affections of the sisters. They function in the assembly as much as the brothers, though with them the service is more veiled. Every intelligent sister knows at any point in the service of the assembly the kind of hymn that should be given out, and how divine Persons should be addressed in praise. The priesthood of the Old Testament is typical of what characterises spiritual persons in the New and we should be altogether wrong if we limited this to the brothers. Among the choicest priests of the New Testament were such holy women as the virgin Mary and the aged Anna. We may be sure that they knew how to serve in a priestly way far better than the official priesthood generally, though Zacharias is the proof that there was at least one of that class who fulfilled the order of his course in a suitable way.
{122}
It is the service of spiritual men to voice in the assembly what is in the hearts of all, and spiritual men understand the service, and, according to the type we are considering, they are ready and, indeed, under obligation to fulfil their course when it comes to their turn. We may gather from the fact that all the priests and Levites had to serve in succession that it would be pleasing to God for all spiritual men to take their turn in the service of praise. No brother is disqualified, save by the allowance of something that is contrary to holiness. Each brother ought to know whether he is spiritual or not, and if he has to admit that he is unspiritual why should he remain so? Why should he go on in a state which unfits him for holy service?
The divine thought is that the whole twenty-four courses are to exercise priestly functions in turn. And if every brother is in the light of God revealed in Christ, and has liberty in the Spirit of sonship, why should he not be free to express what is in his heart, and what he knows is in the hearts of all in the assembly? It is the same holy service going on universally, and going on in uniformity, but enhanced by the variety of the "courses" which succeed each other. One can understand how the priest or Levite who loved Jehovah would long for his turn to come round. When it did he had about fifty weeks to wait before it came round again! We are much more highly privileged. We may have our time of priestly service in the assembly every first day of the week. If on one occasion a brother finds no opportunity by reason of others having much liberty and enlargement of heart in the service, he has only to wait one week and he may have opportunity to fulfil his "course". The service has the same blessed character each Lord's day, but it is enhanced, as we have said, by being carried on by different members of the holy priesthood. Such an order of
{123}
service is not only well-pleasing to God, but it is the exposure and condemnation of all that pretends to be 'divine service' in the religious world.
The Levites "under the direction of their fathers, Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman, for song in the house of Jehovah" (@1 Chronicles 25: 6) were also appointed to serve in twenty-four "charges". This character of service is not altogether Godward for it is largely marked by prophesying (see @1 Chronicles 25: 1, 2, 3), and this indicates that it is for the comfort and enlargement of saints with reference to the service of God. This feature is to be continuously present. It is not prophesying to exercise consciences, or to make men fall down as convicted (@1 Corinthians 14: 24, 25), but prophesying which brings the blessedness of God into the hearts of His saints in a very happy way. It is "with harps and lutes and cymbals", and it is said of some that they "prophesied with the harp, to give thanks and to praise Jehovah". This accords with the words, "Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and chanting with your heart to the Lord" (@Ephesians 5: 19, and see also @Colossians 3: 16). Whatever is addressed to divine Persons in the assembly has a prophetic bearing on the saints who may be present. It forms and stimulates their affections Godward. The apostle Paul often introduces in his epistles prayers and ascriptions of praise to God, but it is evident that he does so with a prophetic purpose. That is, he has in mind to affect the saints in *their* relations to God by the expression of his own. And this feature enters into all the service of God in His house. It ministers to God, but it also promotes happy and worshipful feelings in His saints. This is the prophetic side of it, which is never to be absent.
It may be noted, in this connection, that Paul says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
{124}
Christ" (@Ephesians 1: 3), and these words are the beginning of a long sentence which extends to verse 14. It is all such a worshipful utterance as might have fallen from Paul's lips in the assembly. He is prophesying "with the harp", sounding forth with spiritual skill sweet and varied notes, every one of which brings out the praise of the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, but all having the saints in view, that their souls may be filled with the music that was in his own heart Godward. It was thus not only praise but prophesying, and this is an important feature of assembly service.
But what is prominent in the scripture before us is that the service goes round the whole levitical family. There are twenty-four courses with twelve Levites in each course, representing in a typical way the whole praising company, each one having to take up his service as it fell to him by lot. "The small as well as the great, the teacher with the scholar" (@1 Chronicles 25: 8). So that none can excuse himself on the ground that he is "small" or that he is only as yet a "scholar". Most of us, perhaps, come under these heads, and yet grace permits us a part in the great service of song and in its prophetic aspect. The fact that in verse 7 they are all said to be "instructed in the songs of Jehovah, all of them skilful" would intimate that all saints, viewed as divinely taught, are competent for this holy service. All have in their hearts the knowledge of God as revealed in His Son, all have the Spirit of sonship. Why should they be unable to express what is in their hearts? Why should any human order or any self-imposed restraint hinder the "harps and lutes and cymbals" from sounding forth, not only for God's praise directly but also to stimulate others in a prophetic way? God would have each brother in the assembly to be ready for his turn in the service. The time and manner of it is a matter of spiritual "direction" -- a word which
{125}
occurs five times in the first six verses of chapter 25 -- which suggests that order is preserved in the service. There is no clashing or discord, and yet every one of the 288 Levites gets his turn and harmonises with all the others. There is nothing at all like this in the human arrangements of the religious world. It is a most admirably ordered service, of which every part is a living contribution from hearts that know God and are supremely happy in praising Him. And every note thus sounded is expressive of what is in the hearts of the whole praising company. Each one who voices the praise is conscious that all the holy brethren are one with him in what he says, and that he is also stimulating in them what is precious in his own heart. This latter is the prophetic side of the service. It is evident that the knowledge of this secures liberty for all. No one need be nervous in the presence of persons who all think exactly as he does, and feel as he feels.
The Lord is the supreme Director of all spiritual service; He is *the* Minister of the sanctuary. Unless we come under His direction we shall not be skilful in the service. But there was not only the direction of David, according to verses 2 and 7, but also the direction of the fathers Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman (verses 2, 3 and 6). This shows, I think, that we may learn by observing how spiritual men and elder brethren move in the house of God, and by paying attention to any instruction which they may give us.
It is important to note that the same service is carried on by each of the twenty-four courses. Though many, in turn, have their part in it the service is one. It is giving thanks and praising God as He is revealed in Christ. It is uttering "words of God, to exalt his power", which I take to be words which speak of God, and exalt His power as it is known in Christ, and as it operates towards His
{126}
saints, giving them a wholly new place and state before Him. It rises to such notes as only those with the Spirit of sonship could reach. But it is a universal service; it is the service proper to every saint of the assembly. It is viewed here as taken up in turn by each member of the praising company. Shall we not all be inwardly moved to take our turn in that holy service in the assembly?
We pass in @1 Chronicles 27 to another kind of service in which there were twelve divisions, each division serving for one month "throughout the months of the year". The same service in maintaining what was due to the king had to be carried out in successive divisions all the year round. Whichever division might be actually serving, the rights of the king were to be maintained with equal faithfulness. Every one in the whole company of those who serve the Lord is under responsibility to maintain what is due to Him. Twelve and twenty-four are universal numbers, but all the saints are not exactly in active service all the time. But each division has to be in readiness to serve as its turn comes round. I think this applies to the maintenance of principles which involve what is due to the Lord. The principles of the fellowship have to be maintained in faithfulness; righteousness and holiness in respect of the truth have to be equally maintained by all. The division in charge at any particular time would represent those who are called upon to act in any matter for the honour of the Lord's name.
Such matters have always to be dealt with locally, and whenever they arise saints should be found ready to serve in relation to them. If any matter connected with divine administration in the assembly arises in any locality it is the time for that particular division to serve. And the fact that there were twenty-four thousand in each division suggests that universal principles must always be acted on. Each division takes account of what is due
{127}
to the Lord universally and acts, when its turn comes round, to maintain fidelity to the universal standard. So that, in the principle of it, the twenty-four thousand are present in dealing with each matter as it arises. That is, the smallest company of saints who may be called upon to maintain the rights of the Lord acts in the consciousness that what is rightly done represents the universal judgment of all faithful saints. And we all share an equal responsibility as to this, for if we are truly committed to the fellowship we must admit responsibility to maintain what is in accord with it. This service, in its actual administration, goes round and it is for each division, and each member of each division, to be ready to serve in it when the lot falls to us. None of us can say, 'This is not my business'. We are all enrolled to take our part in it, and we cannot righteously evade the responsibility of taking it up when our turn comes.
Then, in addition to the service by courses, in which all take part in the same service, there is also another kind of service in which each individual has his own particular office. This is seen, typically, in @1 Chronicles 27:25 - 34. We may be quite sure that each one mentioned in this section had some "particular ability" (@Matthew 25: 15) for the post to which he was appointed. We need to understand how to serve in "courses" first -- how to take our part in the service of the assembly and in the maintenance of the fellowship collectively -- so that what we do in our own department may fit in spiritually with what every other servant is doing. This is not recognised where a human order prevails, and hence the individual services do not co-ordinate. There may be a measure of faithful service individually, but it is carried on in a detached way. But, for us, the departmental service is that of members of one body. And, according to the truth, we all say, 'Abba, Father', together as in @Romans 8
{128}
before we take up our different individual services as in @Romans 12. In like manner we have the truth of the fellowship, and the coming together in assembly and the eating of the Lord's supper, in @1 Corinthians 10 and 11 before the apostle speaks of the distinctions of gifts and services and operations in @1 Corinthians 12. And after speaking of the distinctive gifts he is careful to show that they co-ordinate and co-operate as members of one body.
In @1 Chronicles 27:25 - 34 no one of those mentioned had to do the same work as any of the others. The whole substance that was king David's was attended to on the principle of each one doing his own part. There were many departments and they did not intermix, nor was any service transferred from one to another. Each kept to his own line and attended to that department to which he was appointed. But all were controlled in unity under the one king David. And so it is now. The different gifts, exercised according as God has dealt to each the measure of faith and according to the grace given, are all to be in diligent activity. There is to be no jealousy or interference one with another. "For, as in one body we have many members, but all the members have not the same office; thus we, being many, are one body in Christ, and each one members one of the other" (@Romans 12: 4, 5). "But there are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are distinctions of services, and the same Lord; and there are distinctions of operations, but the same God who operates all things in all. But to each the manifestation of the Spirit is given for profit" (@1 Corinthians 12: 4 - 7). It is for each one to discover through exercise and prayer, and through moving in the desire to serve, what he is spiritually fitted to do. And it should always be kept in mind that God loves earnest and diligent persons. If you go on with what comes to your hand you
{129}
qualify for some definite service.
We may be sure that each of the men named in @1 Chronicles 27: 25 - 34 had shown some aptitude for the particular office he filled before he was appointed to it. And the Lord discerned some "particular ability" in each of His bondmen before He gave them the talents. Something is sure to come to the hand of every believer as a matter of service to the Lord, and as each one goes faithfully on with it he qualifies for some definite appointment. Speaking practically, this is how gift comes and is developed. No sleepy and indolent person was ever given an important office under the Lord's administration. The man to whom one talent was given was "slothful" as well as "wicked", but his one talent only exposed that he did not care to serve His Master at all, for he did not know Him. He represents a lifeless professor, and we may gather from that part of the parable that a condition in which there is no readiness to serve the Lord is most serious. The Lord's word is, "Cast out the useless bondman into the outer darkness; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth" (@Matthew 25: 30). This will be the end of those bondmen who are "useless". Service is not an optional matter; it is incumbent upon us to consider this very gravely. We are under obligation to be ready to take our turn in the service by "courses", and also to qualify for the particular "office" which is allotted to us in the body.

NOTES OF A READING @1 CHRONICLES 28
@1 Chronicles 28: 1 - 10
C.A.C. Solomon had been charged to build the house before, as we read in chapter 22, but now he is charged in the presence of the princes and the captains and all those who served the king, and the mighty men and all the men of valour; that is, all Israel is brought in, signifying that God intends us all to understand this great matter. All these great men would be brought to understand that there was something greater in the mind of God than all their exploits or dignity, or whatever it might be. So I suppose God might have used any of us in varied capacities in doing His work and in fighting His battles, but He would have us to understand that there is something greater in His mind.
Ques. Would you say that there might be many distinguished and devoted servants in christendom not, however, apprehending this greater thought?
C.A.C. I think it might be said soberly that there are comparatively few who enter into God's thought of what He would have on the earth. The house does not refer to what is in heaven, but to what is set up and is a place of rest for God upon the earth. David was not a suitable man to build it, because he was a man of war and had shed blood. It is very necessary that there should be conflicts and that we should contend earnestly for the faith and stand for what is of God, but if we do not advance further than that, there will be no place of rest secured for the blessed God. It is necessary that adverse powers
{131}
should be overcome, but that is not sufficient of itself to secure rest for God.
No doubt it was in David's heart, but God has given us instruction in showing us that he could not build it. It is introduced to draw a sharp line between overcoming His enemies and fighting His battles, and building His house. There are many in christendom like that with no thought of securing a place of rest for God, where God can be resting.
Rem. A very choice thought.
C.A.C. Yes, it is.
Rem. David says, "Hear me, my brethren and my people" (verse 2).
C.A.C. Yes, it means that we are all to come in and all understand what is God's chief interest at this present moment. I think it is a very definite voice for us. God's thought is that the earth is to be His footstool. It is a restful thought as the youngest could understand. I suppose it means you are seated and your feet restfully provided for. It is wonderful that God should use such a picture, as if to say, 'That is what I want on *earth*, not in heaven'. And that is secured by human hearts entertaining what has come in by Christ, as David says here in verse 2, "I had in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and for the footstool of our God, and I have prepared to build"; that is, the first suggestion is a house of rest for the ark of the covenant.
Ques. Is there any connection here with the Son over God's house (@Hebrews 3: 6)?
C.A.C. Yes, I think it is linked with this because what comes out is that securing the house of rest is connected with Solomon as typical of the Son of the Father's love; so I think that the ark of the covenant, if we take it up in application to ourselves, covers a great deal more than the new covenant.
{132}
Ques. Will you explain your thought further?
C.A.C. The covenant as known by Israel clearly covered all that was in the mind of God for them, and so for us it must include the thought of sonship -- the thought of the covenant as set forth in the assembly. It covers all that is in the heart of God manward, and therefore if we apply to ourselves the thought of the ark of the covenant, it means all God's thoughts in reference to man have been secured in Christ.
I think the building of the temple is the typical climax in the Old Testament; there is nothing beyond it, beyond God securing rest for Himself and bringing to pass everything in His heart. Of course, it was all typified here, there was nothing actually secured; so that Christ can rest, and He can rest in the place that He has in the hearts of His saints who take in all that He expresses of God's thoughts for man, and as we take it in collectively we make a place of rest for Him and the blessed God. It is called "the house of the mercy-seat" (verse 11) -- a beautiful thought, because it brings in the thought of the death of Christ in connection with it.
We need to let these things soak into our affections until they form us, and it is all brought about by Solomon, the son of His love, and Solomon speaks of Christ glorified. The Lord Himself speaks of the glory of Solomon (@Matthew 6: 29). And it is Christ glorified who builds the house; that is, He has passed through death and glorified the Father in all that He has taken up, and now He is glorified; and He is in the bosom of the Father; that is a more intimate thought than being glorified.
Rem. "Father, ... glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee" (@John 17: 1).
C.A.C. "And the glory which thou hast given me I have given them", the Lord says (verse 22). That is the glory of sonship, so that if we want to understand sonship, we
{133}
must see Christ glorified in heaven, reposing in the love of the Father. "Who is in the bosom of the Father", John says (@John 1: 18). So it is in the apprehension of the Son glorified that we see the character of the house, because it is the glorified One in the bosom of the Father who builds the house. F.E.R. used to say, 'Who can speak after the Son, and who can work after the Son?' It is finality.
The thought of the house is as precious now as when it first burst upon the hearts of His own. We must not overlook the thought of God having a footstool on earth. "Thus saith Jehovah: The heavens are my throne, and the earth is my footstool: what is the house that ye will build unto me? and what is the place of my rest?" (@Isaiah 66: 1). So the assembly is His footstool and therefore conditions are provided in God's house on earth that are restful for Him, and they are all provided by One in the enjoyment of the most intimate affection, by One in the bosom of the Father -- because He is there this minute! Everything adverse to Christ is going to be turned into a restful footstool for Him. His very enemies will have been turned into His footstool, so that everything adverse has been banished.
Rem. It would show that it is important to be following the teaching of sonship and the house and the service of God that is given in these days.
C.A.C. Yes, most important. We cannot be too thankful for the light that has been thrown upon the sonship of Christ in order that we should understand the character of the house. It took its character from Solomon. Scripture says, "No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, *he* hath declared him" (@John 1: 18); and that was written sixty or seventy years after the ascension of Christ. That is, the declaration of God comes out from that Man glorified.
{134}
The house of God as a rest for God will never be understood apart from understanding Solomon, of whom God said, "I will be his father, and he shall be my son" (@1 Chronicles 17: 13). "1 will be to him for father, and *he* shall be to me for son" (@Hebrews 1: 5). Isaac and Solomon are the two great types of sonship in the Old Testament. So that the house is a place where God can be in comfort, if one might so say, in complacency, and be restful, because every heart is filled with the thought of the only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, and seeing that glorified Person who came to bring to pass everything of God manward, including sonship. I think it is fine.
Ques. You are not suggesting that it could not be said of Him on earth that He was in the bosom of the Father?
C.A.C. Of course, that is essential to the declaration; but to get the full thought of sonship you must have Him glorified. It is not the full thought on earth. So the gift of the Spirit is given in connection with Him glorified; you must have Him glorified to introduce the economy of the dispensation. Now you have the thing in all its magnificence according to the mind of God. And it is the Spirit coming down and filling human hearts that builds the house. I think we need to ponder all this carefully. If we entered into it how different, and more in power, things would be. In verse 11 we see that the pattern is given by the Spirit, intimating to us that these things are known by the Spirit, and that goes along with the glorified Son of God; what answers to that is the Spirit down here giving the light of it all.
Moses had to 'go up' to see the pattern, but David did not. 'Going up' means that in spirit we have to leave all on man's line. But here is a man on the elevated plane of the Spirit, so he did not need to. If we are on the level of the Spirit we are where all these things are understood. It
{135}
is the Spirit here which brings us into it, not just knowing that Christ is glorified; that will not help us at all.
Rem.
<blockquote>'And see the Spirit's power <br>Has ope'd the heav'nly door'. (`74:5)</blockquote>
Ques. Do we realise it when together?
C.A.C. The house of God is a general thought, but I think it is specially realised when we are together, in liberty and in freedom from the cares of this life. In a certain sense we should be glad never to separate. An old verse says,
<blockquote>'When congregations ne'er break up <br>And sabbaths never end'. </blockquote>
Well, to be engrossed with God and with Christ and with the things of the Spirit, why! we could not wish for anything better. But we have to go back, we need the discipline outside. David had the complete thought of God's house by the Spirit, and God has brought within our range by the Spirit what He is going to have on the earth for His rest. He says, 'I am going to have a people who understand all My thoughts brought in by the Son of My love, and I can rest there'.
Ques. How do @1 Peter 2 and @Ephesians 2 fit in?
C.A.C. Peter looks at it in process of construction, so that he says, "To whom coming ... . yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house" (verses 4, 5). This is the complete thought here, which is a great help to us. In Ephesians Paul is looking at the whole gentile company as "built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit" (verse 22). Every thought is needed.
Ques. If we do not see the completed thought we are not likely to go on with it, would you say?
C.A.C. Yes, I am sure that is so. If we do not see it in Christ in sonship, we shall never see it at all. I may say that I am a poor feeble thing, but what has that to do with
{136}
it? What is my place with God? His Son glorified! It is a good thing to see the pattern. Not a single thing had been done here, for Solomon and his workmen would work to the pattern. We must never have it out of our thoughts for a minute that Christ glorified is the pattern. The Father has given to the Son that peculiar glory that He did not have in the days of His flesh, that He did not have before He went up there, and it is the heavenly glory of the Son of God that is the pattern: 'Thou art the Son!' (`181:1). Christ is risen and glorified, and there is something down here that perfectly corresponds with the Son of God glorified, and that is the assembly. Is that not a marvellous thing?!
Rem. David made great contributions to the house.
C.A.C. They were all brought into it that we should understand the character of the building and work according to the pattern.
Rem. The poverty of our thoughts makes it difficult for us to grasp such riches.
C.A.C. This chapter would help us as to the wealth, which it is impossible to calculate; we need to move more in the region of divine wealth.
There is, of course, the responsible side of all that is made known in light. In verse 8 there is the command to "keep and seek for all the commandments of Jehovah your God" -- that is, everything that is in the divine will. If we are careless we may miss all that we are getting tonight, careless people never get it. Verse 9 says, "For Jehovah searches all hearts, and discerns all the imaginations of the thoughts. If thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cut thee off for ever". That is just as true today as it was then.
Rem. And it is to be passed on (verse 8).
C.A.C. That is it, and if we get careless we may miss the house of God and the inheritance in a practical
{137}
sense. Most believers in the world today are missing it all, and we may miss it, but I trust we are not of that sort. Does not God discern in our hearts and minds the consideration of these things? And if it is not there more than ever, it is a pity. There is always the responsible side as long as we are here. Practically we may be concentrated on the ends of the earth instead of being concentrated on the things of the Spirit and the light of God, and we may miss it. However feeble we are in a spiritual sense does not matter. We are all feeble spiritually; we know very little of the glorified Son of God and of the Spirit here, but let us go in for them more and more.
Rem. It speaks of those with perfect heart who offered willingly (chapter 29: 9).
C.A.C. It applies to each of us tonight, that we should go in for these most wonderful things, more wonderful than anything heard of in the world. God is securing a remnant who cherish the house of God.
{138}
NOTES OF A READING @1 CHRONICLES 28
@1 Chronicles 28:11 - 21
C.A.C. I suppose we are all cognisant of the fact that there is more of the thought of the preparation and of the pattern in Chronicles than we get in the corresponding scriptures in Kings, indicating, I suppose, that in remnant times and days of recovery there is a great deal of exercise on this line if the house is to take spiritual form. David in this scripture is the representative of spiritual persons who are exercised with regard to the house of God.
Ques. Is this a subsequent exercise after what relates to kingdom matters?
C.A.C. Yes, certainly.
Ques. Is it your thought that in days of recovery it is very necessary to pay heed to the pattern of things? In John's epistles it is the things that are from the beginning that are to be heeded.
C.A.C. Yes, and the pattern is given by the Spirit, so that the whole thing is there in pattern before a single stone is laid down.
Ques. Would you say more about Moses going up for the pattern and not David?
C.A.C. The two exercises have to be brought together. Moses has to go up, David not. That is, Moses has to go up to the elevation of divine thoughts; he has to leave what is of the level of man to go up. David represents an advance upon that; he is a man on the level of the Spirit, he is of that elevation.
Ques. Is it your thought that while there is a line of
{139}
recovery or of building in progress, it is not exactly taking shape on that line, but it has been complete in the mind of God already?
C.A.C. In a day of peculiar weakness such as Chronicles portrays, it is specially important to get what is in the mind of God, so that we must work to the pattern.
Rem. We are not to shape things after our own ideas; it is a question of conforming to the thoughts of God.
C.A.C. David understood as a spiritual man, divinely taught, that the building of the house is contingent on sonship. Sonship is, of course, seen in Solomon not yet apprehended in a very mature way: "Solomon my son, the one whom God has chosen, is young and tender, and the work is great; for this palace is not to be for man, but for Jehovah Elohim" (chapter 29: 1). Solomon at this stage represents the thought of sonship only apprehended in a very immature way. Well, it is something to get that.
Ques. Does verse 9 mean, if you seek the Lord on this line?
C.A.C. Yes, it is the responsible side which is always present as long as we are here; it enters into everything, and it is, "If he be firm to do my commandments" (verse 7). It is always important not to disregard any commandment of the Lord; that secures the moral line. The great thoughts of God are developed here in David's mind, just as *we* should get an apprehension of the house, because it is to be built now.
Ques. Why is the porch mentioned first? (verse 11).
C.A.C. Because the porch is the important matter publicly, the outstanding feature which must have attracted attention at a great distance, being very prominent as far higher than all the rest of the building, and therefore what is to be represented of God to men in a public way.
{140}
Ques. Would the porch compare with the first epistle to the Corinthians?
C.A.C. I think it is the public side as represented really in the glad tidings, because the first thing to take account of in the house of God is that God should have a place of testimony in this world. It is God's approach to men in the glad tidings and all inside the house is there to give support to it, to give character and richness to what is represented to men. God has been pleased to put Himself into communication with men by means of His house. To take an illustration, there were one hundred and twenty persons in @Acts 1, and God put His Spirit upon them in order that there should be set forth by them in a public way the great things of God.
Rem. It is interesting that the height of the porch is one hundred and twenty cubits.
C.A.C. Yes, I thought so. Those one hundred and twenty were acquainted with the life of the Lord here and knew Him in resurrection and saw Him taken up; it all enters into the height of the porch, I think.
Here we are dealing with the pattern, there cannot be any divergence from the pattern. Ezra writes this to help and comfort us in a time of weakness, and there cannot be any deviation from the pattern. God's mind cannot be any different today from what it was at Pentecost. It would not be so, because recovery must be on that line. We have it in the Scripture; it is very significant because David says he has it in writing.
Rem. "Every scripture is divinely inspired" (@2 Timothy 3: 16).
C.A.C. So that the two things are very remarkably brought together; the Spirit and the writing. He is as really and definitely here as He was on the day of Pentecost; there is no diminution; and then we have it also in writing; in the Scriptures we have it permanently.
{141}
Ques. With reference to the relative size of the porch and the house, would you say that what relates to God must always be greater than anything the saints can be?
C.A.C. Because the gospel is purely of God, and the assembly is creature; so the gospel must be greater, for it relates to God Himself, to divine Persons; there is no creature element in it. It is the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, all that is known of the Deity in the activity of divine love. When you come to the assembly you come to a creature vessel.
Rem. You once said that what is produced cannot be so great as what produces it.
C.A.C. Thank you for recalling it to me. It is so. All inside the house, the houses and the treasuries and the chambers are all directly connected with the porch and are, I think, what Paul calls "the mystery of the glad tidings" (@Ephesians 6: 19). Thus it is not only the glad tidings, but something behind the glad tidings; that is, a wonderful vessel for the support of the glad tidings. The particular bearing of this passage is that all that is behind is for the enrichment of the gospel. It is not only the glad tidings but there is a secret behind it and the secret behind it is the mystery. If the saints are not up to the truth of the house, there is sure to be weakness in the testimony. It is "the porch, and of its houses, and of its treasuries ...".
Ques. Why is there no mention of the altar and the laver?
C.A.C. Well, there is instruction in that.
Rem. The altar was of a very great size so must have been a very prominent object.
C.A.C. But it was really external to the house.
Rem. It was in relation to an opposite movement.
C.A.C. Yes, the approach of men. The prominent thought in these verses is God's approach to men; He has set up a wonderful way of approach to men.
{142}
Rem. "God's house, which is ... the pillar and base of the truth" (@1 Timothy 3: 15).
C.A.C. Yes, and it is the thought that there is something here in support of the testimony. If saints are weak you could not expect the testimony to go out in power.
There are various things spoken of: houses, treasuries, chambers and the house of the mercy-seat, and all are connected with the thought of the porch.
Rem. In verse 13 you come to the thought of the service Godward. Verse 11 covers the whole pattern, and the rest that follows is in detail.
C.A.C. The saints dwell together in the love of God; what a support that is to the testimony. They are set there and are near to one another, because they are all enjoying the same thing.
Ques. Will you say something on "the house of the mercy-seat"?
C.A.C. You come to the holiest there. "The treasuries" are an accumulation of precious things, such as have been gathered during the last one hundred years. Then the "upper chambers" would suggest the elevated character of all that is known in the house of God, "things above". The "inner chambers" would go with @John 14 - 17 where the Lord is in secret with His own, opening up the thoughts of God. We enter the house in seeing that Christ is God's resource, to carry out all His thoughts and purposes. All that is for the support. The "mercy-seat" is where everything centres, and all that can be effectuated through this. He does not want us to deviate from the pattern. What are we really set for? Well, we must work to this pattern; there is no other way. Do we really want the house of God to be set forth rightly in this world? Public witness is a very great matter for God; the gospel is to be preached continually to men. I do not think the house of God is there at all if that is
{143}
not present.
Rem. "To announce among the nations the glad tidings of the unsearchable riches of the Christ, and to enlighten all with the knowledge of what is the administration of the mystery" (@Ephesians 3: 8, 9). Paul was a herald.
C.A.C. Yes, so that all that Paul brings out in his special ministry as "the mystery" is all supposed to work out as a most blessed witness of the true character of God in a world steeped in evil.
Ques. If we conformed to this pattern, would preachers come to light?
C.A.C. It is the grand feature of the house that is involved. If not there in some extent, there cannot be a proper representation of God publicly. Paul was the one to bring out the great thought of sonship as seen in the Son of God. It was his ministry, he presents the Son of God. That is how he began, in order that we should apprehend sonship as seen in Christ.
They made Solomon king a second time (chapter 29: 22); that is, they came typically to maturity in the thought of the sonship of Christ.
And there is plenty of room to move about as we see in verse 12: "The courts of the house of Jehovah, and of all the chambers round about". It is a spacious place.
Rem. We seem to be so occupied with the poverty and smallness of things.
C.A.C. This chapter would correct that in the thought of richness and divine wealth and spaciousness, before he comes to the actual service of the house. People get tired of reading the Bible sometimes, they feel it cramps them.
Ques. How is that?
C.A.C. I do not know.
It is much according to the pattern to begin with the Son of God. If all christendom has disregarded the pattern,
{144}
it is all the more necessary that we should pay great attention to it. There are the courses of the priests and Levites, and then the instruments of gold and silver; we have to learn how to regard ourselves as vessels for the service of God. Weight is of importance, we are often so shallow and empty. They are *utensils*, not ornaments; that is, things for use.
Rem. There is nothing less than silver or gold.
C.A.C. They are the two aspects in which the saints can be regarded. As vessels of silver they have a place with God on the ground of redemption -- all saints are on that ground surely. There are certain portions and places we occupy in virtue of redemption, that we had no part in, and they constitute silver utensils. In another aspect they are vessels of gold.
Ques. Would it be the difference between Paul's and John's way of speaking?
C.A.C. Yes, generally speaking, but they overlap. Gold would represent what the saints are according to the work of God in them. @John 17, for instance, is not a question of redemption, but what they are as divine workmanship, as born of God -- that is gold.
Rem. There are silver candlesticks as well as golden ones (verse 15).
C.A.C. It is to liberate us. You get a fulness and variety in the temple that is not in the tabernacle, and you get the thought of silver introduced largely as enabling the saints to serve as proving redemption; it is an element in liberty. When we eat the Supper we do so as vessels of silver, but when we move on we are vessels of gold. Redemption was accomplished entirely outside ourselves, and is going to be applied to us even as regards our bodies. Redemption implies that we are of great value to God, and He would do all in His power to liberate us to serve Him in His house, and it is in the
{145}
death of Christ that He effects that.
It is very interesting that you get this addition which seems to broaden the basis of service. Nothing can diminish the value of redemption and nothing can deteriorate our place with God as secured by the redemptive work of the Lord Jesus. It cannot be diminished and it cannot be increased. It is all very interesting as showing the pattern; now we have to work to it.
{146}
NOTES OF A READING @1 CHRONICLES 29
@1 Chronicles 29: 1 - 19
C.A.C. In the understanding of the types it is necessary to see that David is a type of Christ as the One who prepares everything for the house. Solomon is the builder but David provides and prepares all the material; he provides all the material and the personnel.
Ques. In what way is David a type of Christ here?
C.A.C. In the most important sense nothing can be added to what Christ has provided for the house. All the impressions of God which constitute the saints material for the house have been brought in by Christ.
Rem. "All that the Father gives me shall come to me" (@John 6: 37) is a prepared company, really in connection with the house.
Ques. Does Solomon represent sonship in the saints undeveloped here?
C.A.C. Yes, because if we look at the matter from the responsible side, that is, how the house actually comes into being, it must be worked out in the saints, but that is in connection with Christ in glory. David is a type of Christ here on earth in the declaration of God in all that can be known, and it is really the knowledge of God in the light of redemption; all that is brought into the souls of men constitutes them material to be brought into the house.
Rem. The gospel of Luke gives the gathering of the material and ends in filling the house with praise.
C.A.C. Luke brings in the silver side, as we saw last week; the gold and the silver go together. But when it
{147}
comes to working things out Christ as glorified must be known; He builds the house. The Spirit comes from Christ glorified; It could not be given before. So that the saints having the Spirit of the glorified Man are suitable for the building. We need to apprehend these thoughts to understand the greatness of the place that is being built now in relation to Christ glorified.
Ques. Everything is intrinsic and not of mixed material. Is everything to be prepared in view of its final completion and the glory coming into the house?
C.A.C. And all has been secured in the coming in of Christ in the David character in the accomplishment of redemption, so that those who receive Christ become material for the house.
Ques. Would the palace correspond with the thought of the house in Hebrews, being the greatest and involving all the administration? What do we understand by it?
C.A.C. I think it is in every way suitable to God. The palace is not for man, but for God. God would give us a deepened sense of the greatness of the palace. It is not for man and nothing has any place in the palace but what came in by Christ, so that it comes up to the requirements.
Rem. We have not reached the stage when it is in the full display of glory.
C.A.C. It is the thing proposed here, and God would suggest to us that He has something very great in His mind, that can only be worked out as the great thought of sonship is apprehended, as set forth in Christ glorified, not what He was here, but what He is now.
Rem. David said, "But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer willingly ..." (verse 14) -- a very humble view of things.
C.A.C. What you find in Scripture is that saints have to distinguish what they are as the result of what Christ
{148}
has done, and what they are personally. Paul can speak of a man in Christ going into paradise, into the third heaven (@2 Corinthians 12: 4), without a sense of disparity, and yet he could speak of himself as "less than the least of all saints" (@Ephesians 3: 8), also "I am the least of the apostles ..." (@1 Corinthians 15: 9). I feel sometimes that I am the poorest saint on the earth, I do really sometimes. And yet God had made them capable of providing such riches for the house. But then the exalted thought of what we are in Christ never prevents us from taking the lowest place personally. The higher we go up in that sense, the lower we come down here personally. He is bringing out that it is entirely of God, like the end of Romans: "For of him, and through him, and for him are all things ..." (chapter 11: 36). It goes along with "thou art exalted as Head above all" in verse 11 of our chapter.
Ques. Is he bringing out the key of the matter, the highest point reached?
C.A.C. I think it is the highest point reached in the Old Testament; we learn what has been brought in by Christ in the revelation of God in redemption; the spirit of sonship in the people willing to consecrate themselves to Jehovah, so that there is a wonderful offering on the part of the people and this leads on to the thought of the headship of God, that whatever Christ has brought in has its source in God; whatever has been brought in has its origin in God.
Ques. Does this go on to Corinthians, God all in all? (@1 Corinthians 15: 28).
C.A.C. I thought so, it goes on to God all in all; God is given the kingdom. We do not often reach the thought of God as Head above all in our meetings, though we reach the Father.
Ques. Is it realised under the headship of Christ? David here leads the people.
{149}
C.A.C. Yes, so David and Solomon are both types of the headship of Christ, and that leads on to the headship of God. Everything that God gives goes back to Him: you have here the highest point of worship in the Old Testament.
Rem. "When he gives up the kingdom to him who is God and Father" (@1 Corinthians 15: 24).
C.A.C. All kingdom rights revert eventually to God, what has been invested in Christ for the accomplishment of certain purposes all reverts to God. So it comes out here that David speaks of what he does in his affection for the house of God, so you see what he is in sonship. You see in @Psalm 89 that he calls God Father, and he is the firstborn (verses 26, 27), so that David is in sonship as well as Solomon. And this spirit of sacrifice seen in sonship in David moves all the people, and that is what God seeks should be in our affections. It will only be built in that way.
Rem. If we understood better what Christ is in relation to the assembly as Head, we should have it in our affections.
C.A.C. Yes. I think it was all written that we might come into it now.
Rem. It speaks of sons and daughters in the palace: "Our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; our daughters as corner-columns, sculptured after the fashion of a palace" (@Psalm 144: 12).
C.A.C. Yes, it is the beautiful thought of the family setting in relation to God. A house without a family in it would not be worth much to God.
Rem. The thought of this offering that is so pleasing to God can be a spiritual expansion with the saints.
C.A.C. Yes, while Christ provides everything, yet the principle is extended to the saints of coming into line and contributing, and what gives rise to a wonderful ascription
{150}
of praise to God is what came out in the saints, the wonderful liberality to the house that leads David to break out into this praise as tracing all back to God.
Rem. The giving seems greater here; that is, what is provided in affection.
C.A.C. Yes, what he provides in his affection is really through his sufferings. That he goes through all that affliction would make the Lord's name to be dearer, and His praises to resound in the assembly. In a sense nothing can surpass what He has secured through suffering and death (see chapter 22: 14). Then there is the thought in this chapter of his affection; as son he thinks of all that can gratify God in His house, all that can spring from the spirit of sonship. They are two thoughts of the house that are commensurate.
It is beautiful to think of the Lord moving in His affections. "That the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father has commanded me, thus I do" (@John 14: 31), which is a wonderful side of it. John is what Christ secures on the line of affection, while Matthew, Mark and Luke give more what He had to pass through to secure praise for the Father.
Ques. "I have given of my own property" (verse 3); how would that apply to Christ?
C.A.C. He undertakes to supply out of His own wealth all that is necessary to enrich the house.
Rem. It was "over and above" all that he had prepared (verse 3).
Rem. There is something very personal about it.
C.A.C. And He appropriates in John's gospel all the Father's things. "All things that the Father has are mine" (@John 16: 15). He has a commonwealth with the Father.
Ques. Why did the people give so much, that they exceeded?
C.A.C. They took character from David. They had
{151}
before them the one who had given immense quantities of wealth, an incalculable amount, and they come under his influence and move in the same spirit. Nothing is of value in the house but the Spirit of the glorified Man in the saints.
Rem. He gave more than they all, and at this phase they exceeded.
C.A.C. What he gave here did not cover all he gave; this is what J.B.S. would call 'excess'. "Over and above" is surplus. In the gospel of John the surplus comes out; there is excess, that which necessarily must be when we consider who the Person is who gives it all. The Son's love and the Father's love: there is a surpassing character and excellence in it all.
The saints are furnished out of the wealth of God, "That hidden wisdom which God had predetermined before the ages for our glory" (@1 Corinthians 2: 7); what wealth there is in it. The result of our acquiring the wealth is that we have something to bring back to God, and it is our pleasure too, particularly in the assembly. It is brought back to God. It works out in our getting an apprehension of God as Christ has declared Him. He says: "In the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises" (@Hebrews 2: 12); the heart of Christ is full of the thoughts of the blessed God manward. The saints having the Spirit of the glorified Man can bring that back.
Rem. "Keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people" (verse 18). It is Christ keeping the great thoughts of God in the hearts of His people.
Rem. Like the thought of the stones "to be set" (verse 2).
C.A.C. The saints have distinctiveness. The stones refer to what the saints are in their personal distinctiveness. So that John is not exactly like Paul, and Peter is different from either of them. The Lord has in mind to
{152}
have a great amount of variety and adornment in the house, so that the palace is worthy of the One for whom the palace is.
The apostles have a distinctive place in the assembly, they are peculiarly ornamental. It is wonderful to find one's place in the assembly where every person has some special thought of God; the measure may be large or small, but there is a thought of God in the heart of everyone and it came from Christ; he prepared it, and it is developed in each of us by the Spirit of sonship. Well, all that is part of the wealth and adornment of the house.
Ques. Would verse 8 raise an exercise with us: "They with whom stones were found"?
C.A.C. Yes, they gave them to the treasuries. I think there are specialities. If a brother or sister perhaps is given to write a hymn which finds its place in the service of God in the assembly, it is like a gem, it is brought in. And there are some who bring in thoughts of peculiar apprehension of God which is of wealth to the company. If you think of fifty persons together all having the Spirit of the glorified Man what would you look for and expect? Wonderful thoughts of God. Well, they are there, and it is the privilege of some to voice them. The thought is that they are there in the hearts of the saints before they are voiced.
{153}
NOTES OF A READING @1 CHRONICLES 29
@1 Chronicles 29: 20 - 30
C.A.C. What we see at the end of this book is the completion of the service of David, David being specially presented to us, as we know, as the one after God's heart and who should do His will. I was thinking of @Acts 13: 22: "And having removed him he raised up to them David for king, of whom also bearing witness he said, I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who shall do all my will". That is not a precise quotation from Old Testament Scripture, but it is a spiritual summing up of the great service of David, which is reached at the end of 1 Chronicles. It is in these closing chapters that David is seen as a man after God's heart who does all His will: that is, we see everything secured Godward. There is the pattern of the house, and the material for its construction, and the bringing of all the spiritual elements in Israel into line, and then this wonderful utterance of worship to God, perhaps the most remarkable in the Old Testament, ascribing all to God and attributing all to Him; that is, the whole will of God is seen as completed.
Ques. Does @John 17 at all fit in with this? "I have completed the work which thou gavest me that I should do it" (verse 4), and "All things that thou has given me are of thee" (verse 7).
C.A.C. I think that answers precisely to this chapter. The work is viewed as completed, so that all that was completed by David can be, so to speak, passed over to Solomon; the will of God is done in a patriarchal way by David.
{154}
Ques. What is the special importance of that?
C.A.C. David is referred to in that way as the patriarch David. He would bring in in a patriarchal way what would be passed on to his son.
Rem. I have not quite got the idea yet.
C.A.C. This is the setting of the type, David brings the will of God to completion, but he has to pass it over to his son, has he not? The palace was to be built by his son. The thought is that the palace is the beautiful edifice in which all that David has brought in should be enshrined and preserved. It was Solomon's work to do it; David's part was a patriarchal part.
Ques. Perhaps you would explain what the force of patriarchal is?
C.A.C. The thought is a chief father, one who can transmit things to his children. In the type all would be handed over to Solomon, so that to learn the blessedness of Christ as David is preparatory to our learning His blessedness as Solomon, but we must not confound the two.
Rem. So that David speaks of "Jehovah, God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers" (verse 18).
C.A.C. Yes, the thought is seen in them, and especially in the twelve patriarchs. It is the thought of something coming down from the father to the son. We have to transfer the thought to its present setting, and see how all that is completed is passed over to one who is in the relationship of son; and the palace and all enshrined in it is to be built by the son.
Rem. It would open up Hebrews, Christ as Son over God's house.
C.A.C. Yes, it opens up the whole truth of the present position.
Rem. What He gathers up in affection, now He transmits to the family circle.
{155}
C.A.C. Yes, all is transferred into the hand of Solomon.
Rem. And there is David's request that the people should have it for ever "in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart", in the dignity of it (verse 18).
C.A.C. Yes, and all that Christ has accomplished in doing the will of God covers all that He was in incarnation and death and resurrection; all is covered by this David character. We all agree to that, but that is not Solomon. Now we must understand that first, otherwise there will be no palace. There is to be a palace now in which every precious thought brought in and made a reality by Christ as David is to be enshrined as a dignified structure which the saints are. But we do not come into that in any practical sense until we can distinguish between David and Solomon.
Rem. The palace began to be built when Christ was in resurrection.
C.A.C. It is not connected with David having done the will of God at all, but with Solomon.
Rem. In @Matthew 16 the building comes after Peter's confession of the Son of God.
C.A.C. Building is by the Son; it is not a patriarchal thought. We must bear in mind as intelligent persons that for us David and Solomon are seen in one Person. It is not that we derogate glory from Christ by distinguishing His glories, but we enhance them. There is a thought of Christ as Solomon now; He says, "glorify thy Son" (@John 17: 1). What He has in mind is something different from the completed work (verse 4) ("I have completed the work ..." ), and that is the Solomon character, and in that character He builds the palace. God's will covers the divine pleasure. Now, He says, 'I want a palace in which to put it all'. It is passed on to the Son; it is the Son who is glorified.
{156}
Rem. Paul's ministry is on this line.
C.A.C. I think the apostle Paul is precisely the one who brought in Christ as Solomon. Paul's ministry is how the palace is built. His ministry of the glad tidings and the mystery is precisely how the palace was built. But there was something greater than his ministry -- what he saw. He saw Solomon, as it were, in his glory, which is a greater thing. And that is what He wants us to see now. The Son of God glorified -- that is Solomon; and everything is in His hand, in the hand of the glorified Christ, so that He can build a palace down here on the earth to enshrine and preserve these precious things until He comes again. The Solomon character includes the David character. What marvellous elevation it would give to our thoughts, and God would fill us with a sense of glory of Christ as the Son; He glorified Him in sonship.
Ques. Why is Solomon sitting on the throne of Jehovah as king (verse 23)?
C.A.C. He is exercising divine administration, but it is all in view of the palace being built.
Rem. @Psalm 45 tells of the king.
C.A.C. @Psalm 45 is David really, because it speaks of David dealing with his enemies. These great thoughts of God are intended to affect us in every position in which we are found. A clear view of Christ as Son would affect us at every point, and Paul's ministry would put us together as the palace. We do not know much about it.
Ques. Are we not too general in our thoughts as to the glories of Christ?
C.A.C. I think that we should remember that the Bible is a most analytical book; God has been pleased, and I believe I say it in all reverence, to take Christ to pieces that we might consider each particular detail by itself; the types do this for us, bringing them within our
{157}
compass.
Rem. "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand" (@John 3: 35).
C.A.C. That is clearly Solomon. What Christ does for God is David, and what God does for Christ is Solomon; it is quite easy to apprehend. Christ has met and overturned all power and dominion; He has cleared the ground and brought in all for God in His own excellence. "I have glorified *thee* on the earth, I have completed the work which thou gavest me that I should do it" (@John 17:4). Can anything be added to that? It stands in all its grandeur for eternity. 'I have done all this for Thee, now glorify Thy Son'. Now that is Solomon. In the language of the type it is the building of the palace, because what the Lord does with the saints glorifies the Father.
Ques. Is it a greater thing here than the displayed glory in 2 Chronicles?
C.A.C. It is a wonderful climax, this chapter. I think it is greater because here you get the comprehensiveness of the divine thought. In David and Solomon put together you get the complete thought. It is connected with Paul's ministry because you get David and Solomon together.
Ques. Why is David telling the congregation to "Bless ... Jehovah ..." (verse 20).
C.A.C. The spiritual thought is that they have all reached what David reached, under his headship. He extends it to his brethren; and, of course, the blessed Lord calls all the congregation to share with Him. The whole will of God is brought in and established and He can praise God in the light of it, but then He brings the brethren into it. God is seen as the source, He is Head over all. This chapter makes prominent the headship of God; all is traced back to the Father. The Lord extends
{158}
the results of all He has done to the brethren.
Ques. Is there a point to be reached beyond utterance?
C.A.C. I think that is so. It is a wonderful climax reached. There is no such thing as silent praise, but there may be silent worship. You might get in a meeting like this a worshipful spirit without any utterance; the sense of the greatness of God and of what Christ has accomplished for God, and of what God has done with Christ, might make every heart vibrate with worship without any word being uttered.
Ques. Is it illustrated in Corinthians?
C.A.C. The principle is there really; of course, what is seen here is the greatness of the glories of Solomon.
"Jehovah magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him royal majesty such as had not been on any king before him in Israel" (verse 25). That is, it is the transcendent glory of Christ. What is in view here is the great result for God and that this glorious Person is great enough to build the palace. God would fill us with the glory of Christ as Solomon.
Ques. Why was Solomon made king the second time?
(verse 22).
C.A.C. To show us that the people have come to it. God made him king the first time and now the people do it. There is a great advance in the situation.
Ques. How does this work?
C.A.C. I think that God brings about by spiritual instruction and illustration an exceedingly great estimate of Christ in the hearts of His saints, and He gives us to see that all was the result of His becoming man.
It is all gathered up in Christ now as the Son. Christians generally have very little idea of Christ as Solomon.
It works, going on with some of us fifty or sixty years, the Spirit of God and the servants of God always toiling
{159}
with us. What are they labouring for? What is it all intended to do if not to make Christ great in our affections? All that God has done for us and in us, and all ministry, is to enhance Christ to us; we see Him in His surpassing excellence and it is transcendent. As to anyone who has seen the transcendent glory of Christ, do you think he would care a straw for this world? He would not look at it! He would not care whether he was rich or poor or high or low, when once the greatness of Christ personally had come before him; for here He is anointed to be prince which is what He is personally, not officially. Was He not magnified when He shone as light "above the brightness of the sun" on Saul of Tarsus? Saul then had not eyes for anything else.
Rem. The keepers of the vineyard were to bring Solomon a thousand silver pieces (@Song of Songs 8: 11).
C.A.C. He had five times as much as they. You think five times more of Christ than of any of His servants.
Ques. "Behold king Solomon With the crown wherewith his mother crowned him In the day of his espousals" (@Song of Songs 3: 11). What would the crown there represent?
C.A.C. It is very beautiful as bringing in the thought of what the assembly does for Him. The assembly loves to enhance Him. It is a feminine company which makes the Song of Songs one of the most interesting books, because it develops the feminine affection. The assembly loves to crown Him in the day of His espousals. Israel will rejoice in it, but we see it before Israel; Israel will enter into the joy that He has in the day of His espousals. It is not developed in the thought of Solomon, though you do get the gentile bride brought in.
This is the real spring of everything: there could be no
{160}
palace apart from this. That a palace is not the thought of approach is important to see.
Rem. They were eating and drinking before Jehovah with great joy (verse 22).
C.A.C. You see the happy condition of things, and I trust we know something of it in assembly and privately, the happiness of seeing the cumulative glory of Christ as Son.
Rem. The priest comes in here.
C.A.C. I think it is a beautiful hint of provision being made for priestly service, not only the administrative side in the son as king, but a consideration for the pleasure of God; it goes on with sonship. "And all Israel obeyed him. And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves to Solomon the king" (verses 23, 24). Are we really brought into obedience to Christ as glorified? Paul said he was "not disobedient to the heavenly vision" (@Acts 26: 19). They all come into it, into obedience to Solomon. You cannot see Solomon without submission. "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" (@Acts 9: 6 A.V). Paul was reduced to absolute submission in the twinkling of an eye!
David completes his reign "full of days" (verse 28), and we see in the closing verses how the Spirit of God loves to dwell upon it.
Ques. What were "the times that passed over him" (verse 30)?
C.A.C. Those wonderful times that brought him to complete everything that was in the will of God.
Rem. It says that David reigned forty years over Israel (verse 27).
C.A.C. I think it reminds us that Christ does not get His full place with us all at once. There was a particular investiture of David at Hebron, but it was
{161}
some years before he got his full place. So with us, Christ gets a partial recognition of what is due to Him, but this book contemplates the complete thought, so that David gets his complete place and transfers it to Solomon.

AN OUTLINE OF THE SECOND BOOK OF THE CHRONICLES
{164}
{165}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 1
@2 Chronicles 1: 1 - 16
Ques. Would you say there is any difference in the character of these books, the first and second books of Chronicles?
C.A.C. There would appear to be a certain change in the character in which Solomon is presented, particularly in the first chapter. In the end of the previous book Solomon is clearly a type of Christ, particularly in sonship and as building the house in that character; but it would appear in this opening chapter that we have to look at Solomon in a rather different light. We have always to distinguish in Scripture between persons who are typical of Christ and lines of conduct which rather indicate the shortcomings of such persons who are in other things typical of Christ. What seems to appear in this chapter is the great favour shown to Solomon by God. He "was strengthened in his kingdom, and Jehovah his God was with him and magnified him exceedingly" (verse 1); that is, on God's side every provision was made for him to act most successfully, but he appears to fall short of it.
Ques. Are you alluding to his going to Gibeon?
C.A.C. Yes, he was not a true son in going to Gibeon; his father would not have gone there.
Ques. In what sense was he below his proper calling?
C.A.C. It seems to me that the mind of God as to Solomon was that he should build the house, and he makes no reference to it whatever. I think he was below the level of God's thoughts. God had indicated His mind
{166}
to David. The two great outstanding acts of David's life were placing the ark in Zion and building the altar of burnt-offering in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite. Solomon ignored them both.
Rem. We have thought he had a good beginning; this is not a good beginning.
C.A.C. He had a good beginning on the divine side. He had been furnished with all the means to fulfil his high vocation, but he took a lower line. It often happens with saints that they take a lower line than what is for divine pleasure, and they lose ground. Some of them lost ground in this chapter; Solomon did. Fancy a mighty monarch becoming a horse-dealer!
Rem. It speaks of the tent of meeting being at Gibeon.
C.A.C. That should have reminded him and us that the ark was not there, the very fact that God had forsaken the tent where He had dwelt among men as Asaph tells us. He was the leader of song before the ark and he tells us that God had forsaken the tabernacle of Shiloh; *He* had forsaken it. "And he forsook the tabernacle at Shiloh, the tent where he had dwelt among men" (@Psalm 78:60).
Ques. Is this analogous to the Acts where the disciples were slow to forsake judaism?
C.A.C. Yes, we see how the early church soon declined, and took up a position that answers very much to the high place at Gibeon, dropping down from sonship; and in a public way there has been very little thought of David or Zion or of the ark being brought to a place of rest. There was no place of rest for God at Gibeon. The lesson of this chapter is to teach us to understand the difference between going on with the things that God bears with, and with what is for His pleasure. The ark represents the strength and the rest and complacency of God in covenant relation with His
{167}
people. There was no complacency at Gibeon and no house of God there. The chief interest of God was absent from Solomon's thoughts. He was a pious man and his prayer was answered but he fell short. We should be concerned to go on with what God has for His complacency and rest and not simply with what He bears with. He bears with christendom and one thousand things that christians go on with and yet He is not pleased with the way they are going on.
Ques. Are you concerned about the state of Christendom or ourselves?
C.A.C. Our concern is with ourselves. We do not want to speak about christendom. We do not want to speak of persons outside this room, but in it. The ark was brought to the place of God's rest. "This is my rest for ever; here will I dwell, for I have desired it" (@Psalm 132: 14). Solomon in chapters 2 and 3 is brought back to the divine thought, and what God is doing with every one of us is to make us move from the things that He has borne with to what He has pleasure in.
Ques. What does "the brazen alter" signify (verse 6)?
C.A.C. The brazen altar represents a system that entirely failed to give rest and pleasure to God. It was not a time of rest and God forsook it -- a very solemn thing. God's thought was to dwell restfully and complacently in His people, and He secures that in Zion; and if He does not get it in Zion, He will never get the house built.
Ques. Is God speaking in that way today?
C.A.C. Yes, and I think that any faithful heart would say so, and if I am stupid and ignorant he will bear with me. He does so with men now, He bears with them, but they do not afford Him pleasure or give Him His rest. God's pleasure depends upon our moving in the light that He gives us. It does not matter how earnest and
{168}
active I may be, if I do not move in the light of God I cannot give Him pleasure. Solomon moved away from Zion.
Rem. The ark gives the key to the position.
C.A.C. Yes, that is what has come about by the coming in of Christ. "I have found ... a man after my own heart, who shall do all my will" (@Acts 13:22). And David takes the city of Zion and makes it a royal city under his absolute control. Zion represents the assembly as a place where all that is due to Christ is rendered to Him; and grace reigns there. "Grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life ..." (@Romans 5: 21). It brings about that I do everything for the pleasure of God. On the divine side everything has been furnished for us; none of us can say otherwise.
Rem. The trouble is that we have not paid sufficient attention to the light that God has given.
C.A.C. I think that is just it. Many have remained in sectarian bodies because they have ignored the light that God has given in the last one hundred years. They are worshipping at Gibeon and God forbears, and His loving-kindness endures. "His loving-kindness endureth for ever", was what was sung before the ark and at Gibeon. It is a principle that can never alter, however stupid I am, but that does not secure His rest. Some might say, 'Moses made the tabernacle; the Scripture says so; what are you doing, bringing the ark to Zion, David? Why not leave it there?' David would say, 'Oh, God has moved on; there is a great difference since Moses made the tabernacle, and I am moving on with Him'. So that no christian can excuse himself or let himself off. God has provided in the Spirit and in the grace of Christ and in His own grace a sufficiency so that we need not stop short of God's own pleasure.
Ques. Is there a temporary thought in the tabernacle
{169}
as awaiting completion in the house?
C.A.C. Yes, it was in God's mind that the house should be built and the ark put there, but it gets its place in Zion first. We must understand the reign of grace first. It is a great matter with God that we should understand that He has moved in His ways, not carrying on what He was doing in the Old Testament; and He would have us understand that He bears with a certain legal system of things but it does not give Him pleasure, and christendom has gone back to it. There is much devotion and piety, but God is not pleased.
Rem. The Galatians had fallen into this.
C.A.C. The Galatians had left Zion after having been there. It is dreadful to have known the reign of grace and yet go back to law. The Colossians were in danger of it, and we all are in danger of it.
Ques. Would the altar suggest a 'miserable sinner' line of things?
C.A.C. There is bound to be a measure of bondage if we stop short of God's present mind, "... a spirit of bondage again for fear" (@Romans 8: 15). David, a spiritual man divinely instructed, was afraid to go to Gibeon.
Solomon ought to have been afraid to go to Gibeon.
Rem. This should stir us up to see what use we have made of the light God has given us.
C.A.C. Yes. We should ever remember that it is in Zion that God dwells. There is no scripture that speaks of Him dwelling in Gibeon. He loves to dwell where His grace in Christ has subdued every contrary element -- that is Zion. According to God's thought we have all been born there; we are all sons and daughters of Zion in God's thought (@Psalm 87). If we go back to what has been discarded, we cease to be available for God's pleasure. He discarded the old system and brought in a new system. I think God loves the thought of dwelling. He did
{170}
not give up His thought of dwelling while the ark was in obscurity, but He had long patience, and in these last days He has had patience too until Christ should be recovered in the hearts of His people, so that He could have a place of rest. Now is He going to have it just at the end?
There are two great principles brought out; the placing of the ark in Zion which is the reign of grace, and the building of the altar in the threshing-floor, representing things set up in sovereign mercy; and those two things exclude by their positive power everything that is of the flesh. Now God says, "This is my rest for ever; here will I dwell, for I have desired it" (@Psalm 132: 14). It is lovely. It all bears in a special way on this present time. Anyone can see what a legal state of things there was right up to the beginning of the last century, an admixture of law and grace. You were invested with the imputed righteousness of Christ and that was the best part of christianity! I believe God revived a sense of His grace and of His sovereign mercy. Now saints who have moved according to it are ready for the house. The legal system leads directly into the world; it led Solomon into worldliness. The chief high place is an idolatrous place of worshipping. Everywhere in christendom there is something of God to be found. Any thoughtful Israelite then would have said to himself, 'Where the ark is is the chief point of interest'.
Rem. In the gospel there were little ships on the lake and the Lord was in one. That is like the tent where the ark is.
Rem. It challenges us because the thing is out; David had told Solomon God's thought regarding the house and it has come down to us.
Ques. Do you think he was influenced by the captains of thousands and of hundreds (verse 2), was there danger in
{171}
speaking to them all? Paul conferred with the brethren and was wrongly influenced (@Acts 21: 18 - 26).
C.A.C. Yes, you see this principle of going to Gibeon illustrated in Paul, so that he went right against his own ministry. Where can God dwell? His dwelling place is Zion and represents that body of persons who have come under the reign of grace, under the mighty influence of Christ in grace. It does not matter what we say, if we are not there we shall not afford God rest. Our exercises bring us to the point that nothing will do for us except the sovereign mercy of God. We may be ever so spiritual as David was, but he became self-important, and we need not fear that God will not deal with our self-importance. But when David has found his true place, that he is a debtor to grace, he finds the altar where there is no room for anything but God. Then it is that we can move on to the house.
This chapter is important in bringing out the sifting character of things not giving place to God. God is working with all of us; He is not against us but "for us" to bring us to His thoughts, and so with Solomon. His going to Gibeon resulted in the silver and gold in Jerusalem being as stones, so that really precious things lost their value. He ends as a thoroughly worldly man, and all as the result of going to Gibeon.
He received all that he asked for. How pleased God would have been if he had asked for wisdom and power to build the house. David had emphasised it to him. I think God felt that. God answers his prayers, and He does many prayers that do not please Him. He bears with His people. Ought not these things to have entered the depths of Solomon's soul? He does not refer to them.
Rem. And God does not remind him.
C.A.C. He does not. God comes down to our level. Does that satisfy any of us? I ask myself, does that satisfy
{172}
me, or do I want to move into a region that really gives God pleasure?
Rem. It is like Paul going to Jerusalem.
C.A.C. That illustrates the thing beautifully. When he got to Jerusalem he found it was the most dangerous place on earth, and they made him a legal man too. In spite of that when he was in difficulty the Lord stood by him. Oh! what a Master He is to serve. Many of us know His forbearance in the same way.
{173}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 2
@2 Chronicles 2: 1 - 18
C.A.C. I think we should look in these scriptures for the great principles of divine acting, which would help us in the understanding of matters connected with the house of God today. They are not recorded as history, but as giving us the mind of God according to the Spirit for present application; always bearing in mind, of course, that the house was not built until Christ was glorified, Solomon being a type of Christ as glorified.
Ques. Was this not a great step forward from what we had in the first chapter?
C.A.C. Yes, it seems that Solomon was not acting in the light that had been given to David his father when he went to Gibeon, so that what he does in chapter 1 falls short of what was really pleasing to God. Solomon was hardly up to it but I think he came to it in this chapter. He does not say anything in chapter 1 about building the house which was really the great matter before God. Gibeon was not the place where spiritual light was shining as to the present mind of God, the ark not being there; but now Solomon comes to the thought of God, and I think we can perceive that there is instruction in the kind of labourers that he employs.
Ques. He would be more a type of Christ glorified here?
C.A.C. Yes, and I think the fact of there being this large number of strangers that could be used in building is intended to show us the result that can be brought about under the influence of the power of Christ, so that
{174}
the most unlikely and refractory persons can become serviceable in building the house. We find from chapter 8: 7, 8 that these most unlikely persons, who had been under the expressed judgment of God in Joshua, are now brought under the control of Solomon and become tributary to the house, setting forth the kind of persons used today in connection with the building of God's house.
Ques. Is there something in the fact that the persons are mentioned twice, and the second time are described?
C.A.C. I thought it was intended to convey to us that God takes up those who are by nature children of wrath even as the rest, as Paul says -- that is the class of persons. So if such persons become tributary and serviceable to Solomon for building the house of God, it is a wonderful testimony to the power of Christ.
Ques. Is there a difference between "a house for the name of Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom" (verse 1)?
C.A.C. You mean as a distinction between the two houses? There is a house for Jehovah where service would be carried on Godward whereas the house of the kingdom would be where kingly authority would be exercised manward, so that both sides would be secured, namely, God's service for His pleasure, and the rights of His throne secured. We read of the throne, a wonderful throne, further on.
Ques. Are these the product of the assembly exercises of the saints? Do we see these things as maintained under the hand of Christ? Ephesians has both aspects.
C.A.C. Yes, I think that the effect of Christ glorified secures that all those who come under His hand become serviceable in relation to what is for the pleasure of God, and the maintenance of all that is for God in the kingdom. He can so transform what is worthless and obnoxious that it can be usable.
{175}
Rem. It is as persons in an ordered condition of things.
Rem. You get also the thought of the kingdom in Ephesians.
C.A.C. The two must always go together, the house of God for His service and pleasure, and the kingdom securing the rights of God manward.
Rem. We get the kingdom first in the practical application to ourselves.
C.A.C. Yes, that is the truth developed in the epistle to the Romans first. We must come first to "righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit" (chapter 14: 17) and that is necessary if the house is to come into being for the pleasure of God.
Ques. I wondered why David is concerned with the materials and Solomon turns this thoughts to operatives?
C.A.C. David is the type of Christ as one who completes the will of God, a man after God's heart, and in a sense he provides all the material; it is the fruit of the incarnation and death and resurrection of Christ; but the building is connected with Him as Solomon, as Christ glorified. As the glorified One He builds the assembly: "I will build", He says in @Matthew 16:18. I think the thought of skill comes out very prominently, the need for skill, which it is well for us to note. There is great need of spiritual skill, skilled workmanship; and the teaching we get here is not had by descending into details but by getting principles. You get here that there is no building of the house without the gentile. The sovereignty of God comes in as to the place chosen for the house, the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite (@1 Chronicles 21: 15). But the calling in of Huram shows a kind of necessity that the gentile should be brought in to get the true thought of the house of God.
{176}
Ques. Was this meant when David said that Solomon should add to it?
C.A.C. I think it is an intimation to us of the truth of the mystery.
Rem. David would suggest that the death of Christ laid the great foundation for Jew and gentile and as glorified He gathers them together to put into shape for the house.
C.A.C. It is most important for us to understand the truth of the mystery, the special ministry given to Paul. It is the great distinctive truth of the present moment and necessary for any right understanding of the house of God.
Ques. Would you explain what "the mystery" embraces?
C.A.C. I think it is a term that covers the present acting of God: first it is bringing Jew and gentile together as joint heirs, and a joint body and joint partakers of His promise in Christ Jesus by the glad tidings, and then it takes the form of God's work among the gentiles, as Paul says, "the mystery" summed up as Christ being in the gentiles, "which is Christ in you the hope of glory" (@Colossians 1: 27); in a great company of gentile saints, while individual Jews that are added come in on the same ground. The truth of the mystery is far greater than the ways of God with Israel, than all the promises in the Old Testament. It was a hidden thing, not said to be hidden in the Scriptures but hidden in God. But there are intimations in the Old Testament, and I think that this is one of them, the fact that a gentile king is brought in to furnish for the house along with Solomon.
Rem. We get the Canaanitish woman in the borders of Tyre and Sidon in the gospel (@Matthew 15: 22).
C.A.C. Yes, on the borders of the gentile world; and the house of God was not there in its true character at Pentecost when limited to Jews. The ministry of Paul
{177}
brings in the true character. It was given to him, no one else had it. He is our special apostle; we need to give great heed to him. So it is very interesting to see Solomon and Huram so beautifully united in their care for the house, and a beautiful hint of how things would come to be in its being built. And the reality of it is now. We have part in it, taken up as worthless persons, so that Christ may subdue our lawless will for us to have part in what is to be for the pleasure of God. It is a thing we should cherish intensely.
The Lord's service on earth prepared the material, in the days of His flesh, but He put it all together by sending down His Spirit after He was glorified, and consequent on that Paul was appointed a special minister of the mystery to show how the gentile was called in, which is our part in it. It is all right material, there is no thought of a mixed multitude in the mystery. Paul was not one of the twelve; he was called in love with a special ministry which the twelve did not have. They had the ministry of the kingdom; Paul had the ministry of the assembly. We need to consider very carefully and closely the ministry of Paul if we want to be in the thoughts of God at the present time.
The importance of all this is that if we do not know how God is moving we cannot serve Him intelligently. Solomon was very pious in going to Gibeon, but he was not intelligent in God's mind and did not give Him pleasure. The great thought in the house is that everything is according to the mind of God, so that He can come in and take possession and be delighted with it. It is a great conception and we come to understand what a vessel of divine pleasure the assembly is. Solomon in writing to Huram speaks of the service that would be rendered Godward. In verse 4 he speaks of the incense, the continual shewbread and the burnt-offerings.
Ques. Is it the full range of offerings?
{178}
C.A.C. I think in principle these things cover the whole service Godward for the divine pleasure. The great thing in people's minds today is to get a service that suits man. It is not what suits me, but what suits God; and nothing gives Him pleasure but what answers to His mind. Solomon expects Huram to enter into it all, intelligently to follow all that he said. I think Huram represents the gentile as brought in to complete and fill out the thought of the house. Spiritual skill is being developed amongst the gentiles now. The great bulk of the assembly is composed of gentile nations, and it is developed there to be worked out in localities, not to be worked out as we think, but as He thinks. Looking at the saints abstractly they have the Spirit, and are subjects of divine teaching and they have intelligence. "I speak as to intelligent persons: do *ye* judge what I say" (@1 Corinthians 10: 15) is what Paul says as to the responsibility of the fellowship. I think Solomon speaks to Huram as an intelligent person, and I think God looks to us that we should understand what He says to us as to this knowledge of the mystery.
Ques. Were the wheat, barley, wine and oil for support to those in his service (verse 10)?
C.A.C. I think that strength for labour depended on the food supply. We are feeble in connection with the service of God, because we do not feed sufficiently on the divinely given food.
Ques. Would you say what the "incense" is (verse 4)?
C.A.C. The incense is how the saints speak to God in prayer and praise. Now, do we speak to God as in the knowledge of His own pleasure? If not, I am not qualified to serve Him. God loves that His own precious thoughts should be brought back to Him as sweet incense by His saints. The best example of incense that I know is @John 17.
{179}
Rem. Is that the golden altar?
C.A.C. Yes, it is the Son speaking to the Father, as a divine Person, of course, but here in manhood, and speaking of the saints according to the thoughts of the Father and according to His own thought, and that is very pleasing to God. God would ever have us speak to Him as those who are in Christ. There is suitability to God's present thoughts. God thinks of us as in Christ, having a spirit of sonship and in liberty. I may tell Him of my needs, but my needs do not minister to His pleasure. Incense has fragrance and gives delight and so must have reference to the wonderful place we have before Him.
Then the shewbread no doubt represents all the saints as in the life of Christ before God for His pleasure. Have we learnt to regard ourselves as in the life of Christ and as such for the continual pleasure of God? The divine order would be secured as we held fast to that. The order of the bread speaks of the order of the saints as in the life of Christ. We are called to be that, to be in the life of Christ before God and to refuse the flesh. Paul says, "Rejoicing and seeing your order, and the firmness of your faith in Christ" (@Colossians 2: 5).
Ques. Is the Lord making a new arrangement in @John 17? "When I was with them I kept them in thy name ... And now I come to thee" (verses 12, 13).
C.A.C. Yes, the Lord was contemplating the new position that He was about to take up, and the saints left here to live in His life, so that He might be glorified in them; as He says, "And I am glorified in them" (verse 10).
Then the burnt-offering is the ground of everything, the ground of acceptance. We are always on that ground, and as we are able to take that up we are for the pleasure of God. We bring before Him not our failures and shortcomings but the excellencies of that One. Now is the time when these things are real. All types were shadows
{180}
and the house itself was only a symbol, and it came to nothing; but what it typifies does not come to nothing! God would have us all serve in relation to this wonderful system all set up in Christ. We have come to the substance now.
Rem. So that the sabbath, God's rest, is reached in spirit and the new moons give a fresh appreciation of Christ.
{181}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 3
@2 Chronicles 3: 1 - 17
C.A.C. Solomon is now seen moving in the light that was given to his father David. We noticed in the first chapter how he lost ground by not regarding the spiritual light which had been given; but now he moves in the divine light as we all need to do, and he recognises the principle that everything connected with the house must stand in the sovereignty of mercy.
Ques. You are referring to mount Moriah and the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite (verse 1)?
C.A.C. Yes, it was in the sovereignty of mercy that God indicated the place where the house should be built. It was when everything had broken down, and David himself completely. And in like manner the christian profession has broken down, but the sovereignty of divine mercy remains and that will not fail; and that is the fundamental principle of the house of God, that it stands in the sovereignty of mercy.
Ques. Is there moral significance in commencing "on the second of the second month", on the line of the second being established? (verse 2). All other is discarded.
C.A.C. That is very good. So you get the thought of Solomon's foundation. "This was Solomon's foundation for ... the house of God" (verse 3). We come to something that is going to stand. If the principle of sovereign mercy is accounted as the basis of everything, we have a foundation that cannot be shaken. "*This was Solomon's foundation*" it says, which apparently applies to all that
{182}
he did; the whole structure as set up by Solomon was marked by this foundational feature.
Rem. The foundation of the Lord's house is established in the mountains of holiness (@Psalm 87: 1).
C.A.C. Quite so. So that whatever may be done constructively in relation to the house of God today must conform to God's foundation.
Ques. Are you referring to the work in the saints?
C.A.C. I think the thoughts are blended. These thoughts are very prominent in the closing chapters of the first book; we see that Solomon is typical of the Son who builds, and I think he also may be regarded as representing the saints who come to the truth of what is the mind of God regarding His house.
Rem. The foundation of the house stands sure.
C.A.C. It even remains in difficult times. Paul says, "As a wise architect, I have laid the foundation" (@1 Corinthians 3: 10), and the saints are "built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the corner-stone" (@Ephesians 2: 20). It is at the beginning and is also found at the end. So that is the importance here, that the foundation is found in remnant times -- difficult times, such as we are living in now. It is a great thought for the soul to get hold of at the present time, the thought of the foundation. It is the whole of divine teaching. We come to what is in the mind of God; Solomon does in this chapter, and apparently all that he does is covered by, "This was Solomon's foundation"; that is, it is to be taken morally, it is to be taken symbolically, and covers all.
Ques. Will you say a word as to mount Moriah?
C.A.C. It is the principle of things being shown by Jehovah. They will be permanent, not subject to modification or change, for it remains. The place of sacrifice was shown by Jehovah.
{183}
Rem. It is based on sacrifice.
C.A.C. It must be so. What is to stand must have a sacrificial basis. It is sovereign mercy that reaches us in connection with sacrifice.
Rem. It was in the fourth year of his reign that Solomon began to build.
C.A.C. It suggests that Solomon, like most of us, lost time by not paying serious attention to the divine light given. Time lost can never be regained, it is lost.
Rem. It is the exercise of a good many of us. There is the side that Christ is the Builder, but it is also for us to arrive at the point.
C.A.C. Yes, and I think that is how the Spirit of God would have us take it up. The house is formed through our taking up the exercise. Christ is the Builder, but He does not do it apart from those who compose the house. Here we have the outline of God's making a house to express Himself to men, but looking does not do it; it has to be done through the Spirit. It is the work of the glorified Christ, but it is really done down here. It is a continuous and permanent exercise.
Rem. "In whom all the building fitted together increases to a holy temple in the Lord" (@Ephesians 2: 21). It is a continuous thought. And it is "for a habitation of God in the Spirit" (@Ephesians 2: 22).
C.A.C. Yes, and there is the thought of increase. There is the great thought that God desires to have a dwelling place here on earth where He can be expressed to men in the fulness of His grace. That is the primary thought of God.
Rem. So Christ is the expression of it.
C.A.C. It was expressed when the Son was here upon earth because His body was the temple, and there was the full declaration of God to men. It was begun in the Son incarnate, but that was extended in the saints. It is to
{184}
be expressed in man, to men.
Ques. Would the threshing-floor suggest the precious separated from the vile? Suffering is suggested -- David said, "In my affliction I have prepared ..." (@1 Chronicles 22: 14).
C.A.C. Yes, I thought so. David had to learn to judge the self-importance that desired Israel to be numbered, and he came under judgment on account of it, so nothing remained for him but sovereign mercy, and that is indicated by the threshing-floor. David had gone through the threshing-floor himself, that is, the process.
Ques. Did Paul go through it?
C.A.C. Yes, it was all on the principle of separating what is of the flesh from what is of the Spirit, so that there is a pure product and the wheat is preserved in its own character, separate from the chaff. It all enters into it.
Ques. What is "the first measure" (verse 3)9
C.A.C. That which is from the beginning. We have to learn the proportion in which things stand; they stand in certain definite proportion. It is the first instructions that we have to learn. There are certain things that correspond and stand in definite proportion to each other.
Ques. Will you explain the proportion in these divine principles?
C.A.C. I think we have seen before that the porch sets forth God's approach to men in the glad tidings, the most prominent public feature of the house.
Rem. That too began in Christ personally.
C.A.C. Yes, of course, but then it has been extended. It was greatly extended when the Spirit came down on the one hundred and twenty at Pentecost. Instead of one Man, there were one hundred and twenty of them, all to express what God is to men, and it has been extended ever since. What is set forth in the porch is measured by
{185}
what was in the holiest and by the altar.
Rem. The apostles recognised that the proportion had been destroyed by Judas and restored it before Pentecost.
C.A.C. Yes, they understood they were to be extended in the assembly. An extension from the temple is the house of the most holy place. It sets forth the most intense degree of divine holiness. There could not be anything more intensely holy than 'the holiest'. We find that the measurements of the most holy place are precisely the dimensions of the altar. If God had not been glorified in the altar about sin to the full dimensions of His glory and holiness, how could He present Himself in grace to men?
Ques. Is it in view of response in that measure?
C.A.C. Yes, ultimately. The greatest thought is God coming out, that must be the greatest thought. Whatever conception we may form of the holiness of God, it is essential to His house that we should have an intense conception of it. Where He dwells, He must dwell in holiness. Christendom has little understanding of holiness; it is the great lack, and therefore it has no thought of the house.
Now we are privileged to learn it in the most holy place. It is learnt there in the most holy place of all, where it is possible to know it. We learn not only righteousness but holiness in the death of Christ; it is a more profound thing than righteousness for it is connected with the very nature of God; righteousness is one of the attributes of God. The altar is called 'holiness of holinesses' in Exodus (see @Exodus 26: 33 footnote c), and the "holy of holies" is named the same as the altar (see @Exodus 29: 37), 'holiness of holinesses', speaking of the intense holiness of God. The Spirit of God would have us consider God's intense abhorrence of sin; if you get the
{186}
fullest setting forth of divine holiness in the holy of holies, you get the full setting forth of that holiness in the altar where holiness is glorified.
Now that is the God who dwells in His house. So that all that God is as known in the altar and the holiest corresponds with how He is known to men in the glad tidings. If we were true in what we sang:
<blockquote>'We boast in Thee, Thou source of good, <br>Thy glory fills our sight', (`35:3)</blockquote>
well, that is a glory of infinite holiness. I think more should be said of holiness in the gospel. It is not for me to suggest it, but I think holiness should be more preached in the gospel. Paul says, "According to the Spirit of holiness". He begins Romans with it (chapter 1: 4), which is the great gospel treatise. There are three things spoken of by the same form of words, 'holiness of holinesses': "the most holy place" (@Exodus 26:33), "the altar" (@Exodus 29: 37) and "the incense" (@Exodus 30:36) are all designated by that remarkable expression.
The great lack today is holiness. Someone said to me this week, 'What is needed is more love'. I said, 'What is needed today is more holiness'! And it enters into the presentation of the glad tidings. The great elevation of the porch, which was one hundred and twenty cubits while the rest of the building was thirty cubits, would indicate the great prominence God would give of Himself in all His holiness in the representation of Himself in grace. I do not think we have a true sense of grace if we do not see it connected with holiness. "Every one that has this hope in him purifies himself" (@1 John 3: 3) -- that is the thought of holiness.
Rem. The Lord addresses Philadelphia as "the holy", and in the same passage, lower down, "a pillar in the temple" is mentioned (@Revelation 3: 12).
{187}
C.A.C. Philadelphia exactly fits in here. None of us will be true Philadelphians if we do not take in this instruction in @2 Chronicles 3. Holiness is concentrated for us in the holy of holies. There is a whole mountain of holiness which is a thought of vastness concentrated there, and God's foundation is in the mountains of holiness (@Psalm 87: 1). God could not disregard His nature; how could He! All this teaching is very fundamental. The porch was overlaid with pure gold; indeed, every part of the house was overlaid, but the porch particularly is overlaid with pure gold (verse 4).
Ques. How do you connect the building with pure gold?
C.A.C. In that things can only be effectively presented by those in whom the work of the Spirit has been matured. The gold in this chapter would be best represented in one word, that is 'spirituality', meaning that one is formed in the divine nature. The great point in this chapter is what is overlaid; it is *the overlaying* that is stressed, not the substance overlaid, so you get no cedar in this chapter, no olive-wood and no stones for building. The only material mentioned is the cypress-wood. All this is to be considered carefully.
The "greater house" seems to indicate that the thing is extended. As we move outward there is great extension. The thought of extension runs through all the Lord's parables. You see in the holy place there were two things connected with the testimony: the table of shewbread and the candlestick. There is the thought of extension with both of them. The shewbread might be said to be the extension of Christ in the saints under the eye of God for His pleasure. And so with the candlestick. The Lord could say, "I am the light of the world" (@John 8: 12): that is only one branch, now there are seven candlesticks. There is great extension of the light in the church.
{188}
Ques. What is there distinctive about the cypress-wood?
C.A.C. The Spirit rather discounts the thought of excellency in the material covered in order to emphasise the surpassing excellence of the covering material; whereas the thought of cedar-wood is prominence in things.
Ques. What is the distinction between pure gold and fine gold? Some things are overlaid with one and some with the other.
C.A.C. Is it not to call attention to the surpassing excellence of what God can bring out in men? Cypress-wood is typical of *men* that God can make such wonderful use of: men -- that class of being. Man was an object of great consideration to God, "Let us make man in our image" (@Genesis 1: 26). We have this great dignity, and God can do more with you and me than He could with the angels in heaven, for He can make the saints express Himself. And the work of covering with gold is going on this very minute, since it goes on after the Spirit is received. The greatest part goes on after He is received, namely, the development of the divine nature in the saint, which I think is the covering of gold.
Ques. Is fine gold connected with the saints or with Christ?
C.A.C. I am not sure that we can connect this covering with Christ, for if you allow me to put it, He was solid gold! It is what God could do in men; not exactly what He can do with Christ; of course, all is perfect with Him.
Rem. "We also are men of like passions with you", the apostles said (@Acts 14: 15).
C.A.C. That is the point, "I myself am a man" (@Acts 10: 26): Saul saw a man named Ananias coming in (@Acts 9: 12). It is a great thing for us to understand what it is to be a man. We must not hurry over this wonderful
{189}
instruction; it is something to ponder. God can take up men and introduce a formative power by the Spirit, which is operating now, so there should be a little more gold on me this year than last. That, beloved brethren, is God's great intention: that He should be suitably expressed at the present time in His house in this world -- not in heaven -- to bring men out in an entirely new character as formed by the Spirit. God must have men.
{190}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 3
@2 Chronicles 3: 5 - 17
C.A.C. It has been brought before us on past occasions that the primary thought of the house is that God dwells there, His name is there, with a view to His being expressed in grace to men. There is also the thought of God being approached, which is a corresponding thought, but the first is the greater. The means of approach are set forth in chapter 4; but in chapter 3 it is the construction of the house. Thus at the present time God is giving great extension of what was presented to men in His beloved Son. That is, He is giving extension to it in the way of testimony, and one might say it is an extension of His pleasure.
Ques. Is that connected with the thought of "the greater house" (verse 5)?
C.A.C. Yes, as we move outward, things are extended, not as to their perfection and power and fulness, for that was all set forth in Christ Himself, but things are extended as to the scope of testimony and the sphere of divine pleasure. Things are vastly extended, for the house extends all over the world now.
Rem. And that would be consequent on the ascension of Christ and the gift of the Spirit.
C.A.C. I thought so; things are immensely extended on earth through Christ being glorified.
Ques. Would it be the aspect of the house in 1 Timothy, or in both 1 and 2 Timothy?
C.A.C. I think specially in 2 Timothy. I think you get the porch in 2 Timothy, and the behaviour in the house
{191}
in the first epistle. The porch is the prominent thing in the house. At the beginning of Acts the one hundred and twenty towered far above the temple and all its ritual. The Holy Spirit sent down from heaven gives the true elevation of the porch. There was a great extension in the one hundred and twenty, and more in the three thousand, and then in the five thousand, and then in the myriads, as it says in @Acts 21: 20.
Rem. In 1 Timothy it says, "Who desires that all men should be saved" (chapter 2: 4), and "Who gave himself a ransom for all" (verse 6).
Rem. "From the rising of the sun even unto its setting my name shall be great among the nations" (@Malachi 1: 11).
C.A.C. That is the result -- the response. But the response could never be equal to the coming out, because the coming out is God. The response is of the creature and that could never be so great.
Ques. "Boldness and access in confidence by the faith of him" (@Ephesians 3: 12). Is that the response?
C.A.C. This is the construction of the house which takes its character from Solomon's foundation all through.
Ques. We have often heard it said that 'the response is equal to the revelation'. How would it be not equal to it?
C.A.C. Well, that is true in Christ, that is the measure, the full standard. When we think of what God is in His nature and what His attributes are and then how He can come out in grace, that is transcendent. The city comes down from heaven, with the glory of God. Well, where did she get that? I only wish to distinguish between what is infinite with God and what is limited with the creature. God would have His people set together collectively as His house for the expression of Himself to men; it is the greatest of all.
{192}
Rem. "The glad tidings of the glory of the blessed God" (@1 Timothy 1: 11).
Rem. The approach of God is connected with the house, but must be greater than the house itself.
C.A.C. Yes, and afterwards the cloud came down and filled the house. The cloud was greater than the house. It was the Shekinah.
The saints are qualified by the work of the Spirit and as formed in the divine nature to give a just expression of God, and that is the thought of being covered with gold. Very little is made of the material in this book. In Kings, which gives the heavenly side, more is made of the cedar, the olive-wood and stones for building, but here more is made of the gold with which it is covered. It is a question of men being taken up, and taken up so that they may be covered with gold by the work of the Spirit.
Rem. That is men in general, not taking account of exercise, or large or small.
C.A.C. I think the material is emphasised in Kings because it regards saints as of heavenly origin. The prominent thought here is what they are overlaid with, the gold. The process is going on this minute for I assume that we have the Spirit. The work goes on as we refuse the flesh and give place to the gold. It should increase every year; every year there should be more gold on us.
Rem. It is the prominence given to God's side.
C.A.C. What is prominent is what is effective as the result of the gift of the Spirit, which is not the end as we are inclined to think, but the beginning. The gold is the best, the most excellent quality.
Rem. Much is made of God in the gospels which record the miracles of Christ as Man. It says, "All were astonished at the glorious greatness of God" (@Luke 9:43).
{193}
C.A.C. It is a wonderful statement. Oh, that we could make that impression on people!
Rem. That comes out in @Luke 9 at the foot of the mount of transfiguration after the deliverance effected from Satan.
C.A.C. The whole point is that God may have good pleasure in man; what was in Christ extended in men.
Rem. The Lord "manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him", it says in @John 2: 11.
C.A.C. Yes, it is the full declaration of God in the Son, and that is to be extended in the saints. It is the Spirit's work that covers them with gold.
Rem. The Lord asked, "Which is greater, the gold, or the temple which sanctifies the gold?" (@Matthew 23: 17).
C.A.C. It is a little different there perhaps; that is, the Jews and Pharisees were more occupied with what was outward, but then the great thing was that the temple was there; the spiritual reality of God's name being there was the great thing. We are all more apt to think of the outward than of the inward.
Rem. The great climax of everything is that God will "be all in all" (@1 Corinthians 15: 28).
C.A.C. Yes, I think that is the end of it.
Ques. Would the gold here represent the work of God in relation to the saints?
C.A.C. Yes, it is the thought of being constructed, it is the responsible side. It does not come upon us without exercise, but by refusing the flesh and going on with the Spirit. So the thought is that nothing appears but the work of the Spirit. The house was decorated too with palms and chains and cherubim, which I think falls into line with what we have been saying. Palms speak of victory, of overcoming. Gold is only acquired on the principle of overcoming. If what is of God is to come into practical power in our souls, we must refuse the
{194}
world and the flesh, so that overcoming is vital.
Chains are expressive of holding power. 'Captives in the chains of love', as we often sing. The bridegroom in the Song of Songs says his heart has been ravished "With one chain of thy neck" (chapter 4: 9). It is really by being brought under the captivating power of divine love that things are effected. Whole-heartedness is the product of being captivated.
Rem. I was thinking yesterday that it says, "Daniel purposed in his heart" (@Daniel 1: 8), and of Moses, "It came into his heart to look upon his brethren" (@Acts 7:23).
C.A.C. God exercises a captivating power in the house. The hymn puts it in the future rather, but we would like it in the present. Saints moving on this line will be in personal harmony with the government of God. There would be nothing to conflict with His government.
The seraphim are more connected with His divine nature; the cherubim more with the attributes of God and are suggestive of things marking the saints as the construction goes on. Let us not forget that it goes on now, and it moves on these lines so that there may be a proper expression of God here on earth in His house. And God is dealing with each one individually to set aside what interferes with that.
Rem. Both the cherubim turned inwards in the tabernacle (@Exodus 37: 9), here they "were toward the house".
C.A.C. It think that shows that God in His government is protecting holy things. It is a new and additional feature. Now you get the thought of these large cherubim which are looking outward. I think it indicates the sense that saints get in the holiest of the protecting government of God. If it were not for that we should not be here any
{195}
more. The outward outlook is towards all nations, and so the government of God exercises a protecting influence so that we have the precious things of God.
Rem. There are the "precious stones" (verse 6), a different kind of ornament from the palm-trees and chains.
C.A.C. They would represent saints as having distinctive impressions of Christ. The divine nature is marked by similarity in the saints, all gold. Their exercises give some distinctive feature of Christ that becomes their beauty. It was so with the apostles, and so they are found in the wall of the city (@Revelation 21:14, 19, 20). Mr Stoney used to say, 'We first admire, then accept, and finally, we adopt'. That is, the work will always begin with admiration; we admire what we see in Christ. Then we accept that is the only thing that will do for us, and the will of God; and finally, we adopt it. Do you not think that the adornment comes actually when we adopt it? We are apt to stop at admiring the features of Christ, without adopting them.
Rem. In the gospel I have been noticing how the Lord 'sends out' His disciples. "As the Father sent me forth, I also send you" (@John 20: 21) and other passages.
C.A.C. Quite so. Now the construction work depends on spiritual diligence. It does not go on by listening to ministry. We first learn objectively, and we admire. Then there is a point when we accept; nothing else will do. The thing that is true in Him is true in me. Then we adopt the thing, by the grace of God.
The cherubim being on the walls (verse 7) shows the saints are to harmonise with the government of God. Either we are against it, it grates on us and checks us and we chafe at it, or we are in harmony and find it always working in our favour.
Rem. "All things work together for good to those who love God" (@Romans 8: 28).
{196}
Rem. What a lot of chafing it would save us if we could see this.
Rem. The palm-trees and chains seem linked together.
C.A.C. Yes, I think so. It is a little remarkable that the "upper chambers" (verse 9) are brought in along with the "house of the most holy place" (verses 8, 10). They are covered with gold. The three storeys we get in Kings do not appear here.
Ques. What meaning do you attach to that?
C.A.C. I wondered if the "upper chambers" do not come out in the gospel of John, particularly in chapters 13 - 17.
Rem. They certainly seem upper-chamber chapters.
C.A.C. Would you say they go along with Ephesians? There you have got the elevation of the divine thought.
Rem. "Jesus said these things, and going away hid himself from them" (@John 12:36). Chapters 13 - 17 are said in secret.
C.A.C. He is going to the Father, but linking them with Himself; they are His own in the world, and they are to have part with Him. It is often said that the "many abodes" (@John 14: 2) refer to the chambers of the house, but the place is where He is.
Rem. The length was according to the breadth in the most holy place (verse 8). What is the thought there?
C.A.C. Yes, it is just the same measure as the altar. As we have often been told, the altar is equal to the holiest, speaking of God being glorified with regard to the question of sin.
Rem. "Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him" (@John 13: 31).
C.A.C. It is in every sense equal to the holiest. That is why the saints can have to do with the holiest, because of the death and sufferings of the Son of man.
{197}
Rem. I wondered why Solomon made another brazen altar (chapter 4: 1).
C.A.C. I think the principle is enlargement in the temple. Things are all multiplied and extended. It all bears on this thought that God is extending things in His house. On the basis of God being glorified as to the question of sin, we can have to do with the holiest. And yet there is a veil in Chronicles still, showing that the teaching applies to the present time. There is no veil in Kings.
Ques. Would you say more?
C.A.C. Kings gives the heavenly side of things. You would not expect it in Colossians or Ephesians. If reconciled in the body of His flesh through death, there is suitability to the holiest. Reconciliation fits the saints for the holiest. But then we are not altogether in that region yet. We are living still in flesh, and to enter the holiest we must go through the veil. There must be the personal going in through the death of Christ, and through the value of His blood. That is, "Within the veil" is a purely spiritual region; so that in order to reach it we leave our responsible life and we go through the death of Christ into a purely spiritual region. So it requires exercise to do it.
Rem. There is no mention of scarlet here in the veil as in the tabernacle, but crimson (verse 14).
C.A.C. It brings out the varied glories attached to the Person of Christ, but then He had to go into death that we might go through the veil into the holiest. We cannot go in as natural men and women, we must go "through the veil".
Ques. What is the thought of the nails?
C.A.C. It is an interesting subject of enquiry, why the nails should be found only in the most holy place. It shows the necessity for things to be held together in the
{198}
power of the divine nature. It is an extraordinary weight of gold that covers the most holy place, showing that what pertains to the most holy place requires an extraordinary measure of divine development, things in that region being held together by the nails, which is necessary in order to touch the things that are most holy.
{199}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 3 AND 4
@2 Chronicles 3: 15 - 17; @2 Chronicles 4: 1 - 8
C.A.C. From what we have been reading, I suppose we should gather that things were moving outward, that is, we have had the holy place and the most holy, but now we get what is "before" the temple.
This portion, I should gather, has reference to the saints as set up in the place of testimony.
Ques. Is there any connection between the two pillars before the house and what we get in Timothy, "The pillar and base of the truth"?
C.A.C. I wondered whether that might be a reference or allusion to Jacob's pillar.
Ques. Is it the saints in testimony; is that why there are two pillars?
C.A.C. Well, I should think so. Two is a number that is connected with testimony in Scripture. I wondered whether the thought was that God would set up His saints in such a way that there might be attraction to His house, that people might be attracted to what they see in the pillars. They were before the temple and the thought of ornamentation on them would indicate something attractive. I think we come to that thought in this section. After leaving what is inside the house we are enabled to take up, or rather God would set us up as, an attractive testimony to Himself in this world.
Ques. Would the chains suggest divinely wrought links, and the pomegranates the unity of the fellowship? The pomegranates were placed on the chains.
{200}
C.A.C. Yes, that is interesting and helpful, say a little more.
Rem. The chains suggest distinctly the thought of links and the pomegranates what is compacted in divine affections. The fruit is of that nature, full of numerous and closely packed seeds. It is fellowship in love that binds together. The chains are golden and forged for eternity.
C.A.C. Yes, so that there might be divine features.
Ques. Were there attractive features seen in the temple when the lame man was there, and the apostles said "Look on us" (@Acts 3: 4)?
C.A.C. Yes, I think they were seen in those two servants.
Ques. What had you in mind with regard to Jacob's pillar?
C.A.C. I thought that Timothy was going back to the basic thought of the house of God.
Ques. Is there the thought of dignity attaching to the height of these pillars?
C.A.C. I think so. I wondered whether we could expect saints to come to us apart from being attractive. It should be an exercise to us that those who fear God and value His things should be able to take account of us as different from all around us; so that there should be attraction towards the temple.
Rem. "Of the rest durst no man join them" (@Acts 5: 13). It attracts what is of God and repels what is not of God, would you say?
C.A.C. Yes, I think there is a repellent power about what is of God, repelling what is contrary to itself.
Ques. That should be found among us in our local gatherings, would you say?
C.A.C. Yes, it is the divine thought. The pillars represent a certain prominence, they were lofty pillars, and
{201}
it is God-given prominence. There are two great principles clearly connected with them. Jachin means, "He will establish", and Boaz, "In Him is strength". That is, these pillars would represent the saints as divinely established in Christ and finding all their strength in God. So that things are not only set up but maintained. They are twin pillars, one is not without the other.
Rem. There is no mention of the material the pillars are made of. Would it suggest more what the saints are as in Christ; is it in that connection?
C.A.C. Yes, I should think so, that is, as established by God.
The epistle to the Romans is for that purpose. Paul says, "That I may impart to you some spiritual gift to establish you" (@Romans 1: 11). It is a great epistle to pray over if we want to be established, and it closes, "Now to him that is able to establish you, according to my glad tidings and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery". The Lord is able to establish us, not only in the elements of things, but in the fulness of what is in His own mind. Then we want strength to be maintained in what is of God; and these two thoughts are clearly set forth in these two pillars.
Ques. Is there the thought of adornment in the pillars?
C.A.C. I think so; so that we find at the end of Romans the long list of salutations and the different features in connection with the saints, which brings out how they adorn the position. What God would establish us in is all that came out for His pleasure in Christ. God is never going to change His mind in what pleases Him. He has brought it out fully in Christ, and now it is to be extended. That thought is prominent in connection with the temple; things take a larger form, they are extended and multiplied.
{202}
Ques. Why are things higher here than in Kings?
C.A.C. They are certainly higher than when referred to at the beginning of Kings: see @1 Kings 7: 15, 16. Here the pillars are thirty-five cubits and the capitals another five cubits, which make forty cubits altogether. All this brought out in remnant times gives enlargement of thought to counteract the tendency to look upon it merely as a day of small things. God would counteract that by His word and get us to take an enlarged estimate of things.
We read in Ezra that the temple in that time was actually three times the size of Solomon's; so saying it was nothing was simply a delusion of their unbelief. God's things do not diminish, they increase. It is a fixed principle that does not alter.
Rem. James and Peter and John are referred to as being conspicuous as pillars and they gave to Paul and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship to go to the nations and they to the Jews, so that all help together in the assembly.
C.A.C. Yes. We have to learn to look at things according to God. The day in which we are living is probably the greatest day of all, just before the translation of the saints of the assembly. God's thoughts are being learnt by thousands of saints all over the world, in ministry giving the greatness of God's thoughts in Christ, and the possibilities there are in the Spirit. So that when Paul is shut up in prison and in chains more is expanded in God's wisdom than when he was free.
Rem. "I have strength for all things in him that gives me power", Paul said (@Philippians 4: 13).
C.A.C. I think that is just what it is. We have strength in God to enable us to maintain the things in which He has established us. We are weak things we must confess, but it is because we are not established in Romans. God
{203}
would establish us in Christ and in the Spirit. It brings all that out; but we need the "Boaz" as well as the "Jachin".
Rem. I notice Solomon made a new brazen altar for the temple. This is not the one he used at Gibeon.
C.A.C. And it was a very much larger one, which I think brings out the sacrificial principle. This great altar,, twenty cubits square, shows that the sacrificial principle is to be very great in relation to the house of God. God has brought out the principle in its greatness in Christ; but the altar here refers to the extension of it in the saints.
Ques. Is the brazen altar here for God, or for blessing to men?
C.A.C. It refers to what is offered to God. Christ has introduced the offering period, He has offered up Himself. But the principle of offering is to continue, that is, there is to be a bringing to God of what pleases Him, and at some personal cost.
Rem. It seems to suggest to me here what God finds His complacency in, even in the cherubim.
C.A.C. I think, of course, the offering on the altar is particularly the burnt-offering, and that is delightful to God as a sweet odour of Christ, but it has cost something to get it, which gives it a sacrificial aspect.
Rem. "By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise continually to God" (@Hebrews 13: 15).
C.A.C. Yes, it all costs us something. The knowledge of God in our hearts costs us something; we did not come by it easily. God bears with what does not please Him at Gibeon, but the altar is what ministers to the pleasure of God, and every sacrifice has been acquired through exercise.
Rem. The saints will never lose the sense of sacrifice throughout eternity.
C.A.C. It takes a great deal of its value from the force
{204}
of contrast now. We are to act Godward on the principle of sacrifice, that is, what a brother says in praise to God that has cost him nothing is of no value. What we have had through exercise and anguish of heart, and been broken to pieces over so that we can value Christ, we can bring as appreciating Christ, to God.
Then it is the same of giving; it works both ways. Paul says to the Philippians, "Having received ... the things sent from you, an odour of sweet savour, an acceptable sacrifice, agreeable to God". Well, that enters into the sacrifice on the altar too. It is a wonderful thing that this altar privilege is open to us. Christ has opened the way for us. It has been offered in the fullest possible way in Christ.
Rem. @Ephesians 5: 2 says, "Walk in love, even as the Christ loved us, and delivered himself up for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour".
C.A.C. Yes, it is brought in in a practical way in the walk of the saints. It all takes on an altar character; how we walk together is really a sacrificial thing. If it were understood, we should be more ready to give up our self-importance and all that hinders love. And the sea comes in to help us in that connection. It shows the extensive provision for purification; three thousand baths is an immense quantity of water. And the sea is for the *priests* to wash in; there is no sacrificial service apart from it. The priests wash in it, so it is really connected with altar service. It involves the patient and persistent service of Christ as set forth in the three hundred and twelve bullocks.
Ques. Where does it say three hundred and twelve?
C.A.C. It says so. There was "the similitude of oxen", ten in a cubit; and it was thirty cubits round, so that there were three hundred small and twelve large oxen, all suggesting the patient and persistent service of Christ. It
{205}
belongs to His service that the washing of water by the word should go on, so that we are in suitability for altar service. If it does not go on we are disqualified.
The three hundred oxen, ten in a cubit, set forth how the service of Christ operates in detail. Then the twelve bullocks, north, west, south and east, represent the universality of the service. It is very interesting to think of the patient service of Christ in feet-washing, so that we are fitted for the service of the assembly every time, so that we get freshly washed every time that we go up.
Ques. Would you say that it takes place in your own room?
C.A.C. Yes, or when you meet any brother or sister that may influence you so that a cloud or anything over you is removed. It ought to be done, of course, before we come together.
Ques. Do the lilies on the brim represent the standard of purity required?
C.A.C. Yes, they show a purity that will satisfy all the exigencies of the nature of God.
Ques. Why are all the measurements given here multiples of ten? There is only one twelve. The city is multiples of twelve. Is there a significance in that?
C.A.C. Yes, because it has in view the weakness that marks the saints in relation to responsible service.
Rem. There is provision for the priests for cleansing.
C.A.C. Well, that is His consideration. He is full of consideration for us, and He measures the need of our cleansing service far more than we do. It has to do with the saints as in conditions of weakness. How much we need the service of Christ in detail. There are many things we take no notice of that are grieving to the heart of Christ, and He takes notice of them that they should be cleansed. He would not have anything unsuitable about us for His service. The priests washed themselves,
{206}
suggesting exercise on their part. Sometimes a large adjustment is required to answer to the large oxen, like the clerical or sectarian principle; it is a big thing that positively hinders the service of God, requiring the large oxen. Then there are little details in our lives which need to be cleansed before we can possibly approach the altar.
Kings gives the heavenly side. Chronicles is more occupied with what is worked out here on earth and therefore applies more in its fulness to the millennial time; but it applies to us now and is to be worked out now.
There is great extension, ten lavers, ten candlesticks and ten tables here. Everything prepared for the burnt-offering is to be rinsed, a more particular application of the water than the washing of the priests. Each part of the offering has to be rinsed.
Ques. How does that work out?
C.A.C. In every offering of praise there should be a careful elimination of anything that is of the natural man. Each offering passes under the purifying of the ten lavers. It indicates the refined character of sacrifice: the principle of cleansing is to be applied to every offering. If you do good and communicate, it must be washed or there might be a feature of vainglory in it; for it is not fit for the altar if it is marred by vanity or self-consideration.
The thoughts set out in the tabernacle are here very much extended. The light is not centralised in one, but diffused through ten candlesticks. The Lord is looking for that now. The light is not for one or two, it is to be worked out in and to pervade the whole company of the saints. This number ten suggests that the thing is to be worked out in responsibility. So the principle of purification is applied to all the details of service.
Then the light is diffused. It used to be that there were
{207}
two or three enlightened persons in a meeting, but God wants the light diffused, so that saints as a whole are marked by ability to diffuse the light.
Rem. It says "there were many lights in the upper room" in @Acts 20.
C.A.C. Yes, I think the Lord is deeply interested that there should be a development of light amongst us.
We often hear temple light spoken of, but we shall not get temple light, save as we all get into it, and into the spirit of enquiry. If there were a hundred persons all in the spirit of enquiry there would be a great accession of light. We must all be in it. I think the Lord feels it when we are not interested enough to enquire. There are ten tables, not one: the thing is extended for the pleasure of God, and there is a much greater supply of bread. So that God has more pleasure in the saints; there is more purifying, more light and more spiritual food. We should not be satisfied with anything less than that.
Rem. Would it lead to an increase of gatherings by expansion?
C.A.C. We read later on there were so many offerings that the brazen altar was not great enough to hold them all. A brother said that in a certain meeting there was not time for the brothers to take part that wanted to, and there must be an extension of the assembly. That is what we want to see, so many wanting to serve that there is not time for all.
{208}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 4 AND 5
@2 Chronicles 4: 9 - 22; @2 Chronicles 5: 1
C.A.C. We come in this section to the end of the matters connected with the construction of the house or temple, and it is evident to all that the Spirit of God would lead us to think of the difference between the things made of brass and the things made of gold.
Ques. Would you help us as to the difference between these two?
C.A.C. The things made of brass were in the court and the things made of gold were in the holy place. As far as one can gather, the brass would speak of what has to be considered morally, and I think the gold would refer to what is purely spiritual.
When we speak of things morally, we speak of things that stand related to the question of good and evil. I think saints would be helped if they considered carefully how to distinguish between the moral and the spiritual.
Ques. Does the moral always precede the spiritual?
C.A.C. I think that is so. I think there is a great development of things viewed morally in the epistle to the Romans and in the epistles to the Corinthians, particularly in the first epistle. Things are viewed in these epistles in their moral setting. But when we come to the epistles to the Colossians and Ephesians I think things are viewed in a spiritual setting. Do you think that is right?
Rem. I was thinking of the remnant under Ezra in their journey from Babylon to Jerusalem; they were at the river of Ahava for adjustment.
{209}
C.A.C. Yes, I think that in coming out of captivity, out of all the confusion of the christian profession, we have first to take account of things morally, from the standpoint of what is right and what is wrong.
Rem. And that is why the doors of the court are brass and not gold.
C.A.C. The things in the court are made of brass: the altar, the sea, the lavers and the pillars. It seems to me that things made of brass are from the moral point of view bearing in mind the thought of the brazen serpent, where the question of sin in the flesh is removed. That is not exactly a spiritual question; but the question of separation from evil is really a moral question. If something is wrong I am called to judge it even if I am not a spiritual person; it has to be done in any case.
Rem. The brazen serpent is followed by the springing well.
C.A.C. The well brings in what is spiritual, and qualifies the saints really for what is over Jordan.
Ques. The moral underlies the spiritual always, would you say?
C.A.C. Yes, I thought so. We all realise that things must be morally suitable to God. None of us would expect to understand the spiritual if we are not morally right, if we have some link or habit of life that is a hindrance. We need to be cleansed from what is morally unsuitable to serve. So we find that the sea is the first thing mentioned, which was provision for purification. No such thing would be provided if it were not needed; so it is provided for the priests to wash in because we are still in a place where it is difficult for us to maintain holiness, and we realise that without holiness no one can see the Lord.
Rem. So that the sea immediately follows the brazen altar.
{210}
Ques. Why is it called a sea?
C.A.C. Well, we have been seeing that in the temple there is great extension, so the sea is to impress us with the immense provision there is for purifying and to encourage us to avail ourselves of it so as not to be debarred from service.
Ques. How is holiness connected with Romans? I thought it was righteousness there.
C.A.C. Holiness is distinctly brought before us in chapter 6, you "have your fruit unto holiness". Holiness involves what is moral, that is to say evil involves what is abhorrent to God so we need to use the sea. There is power with it as set on the right; and it is "over against the south", that is, the position is very attractive. We need it all the time we are down here, for service. We shall not need to wash in heaven, the sea there becomes a sea of glass; it is a crystal pavement on which persons stand that have no longer need of washing.
Rem. The Spirit is needed for all this.
C.A.C. The thought of the unction of the Spirit is on the spiritual side because of capacity. The whole range of spiritual things is open to the one who has the unction. There was an absence of spirituality with the Corinthians and Paul said, "Ye are yet carnal". He could not give them meat, he had to give them milk.
The lavers are there for "a pure offering", and the lavers were on wheels, so that you had not to go to them, but they came to you. It is very encouraging that the Lord has so cared for us as priests. We shall leave priesthood behind in heaven. The Lord carried the basin round; He moved round so as to free us to have part with Him (@John 13). The most intense desire of every true lover of Christ is to have part with Him. I know it sometimes stays buried, but it is there. And if we have part with Him it is in what is spiritual, it applies at the
{211}
present time; it will not be wanted in heaven. It seems to me that our priestly state involves the thought of contrariety.
Ques. You connect the water in John with this?
C.A.C. I was thinking of it in connection with the essential characteristic of what is priestly. It contemplates surrounding conditions that are more or less of a defiling character. The Lord's priesthood supposes infirmity on the part of the saints.
Rem. In Revelation l, "To him who loves us, and has washed us from our sins in his blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father".
C.A.C. That is now. I suppose priesthood will cease altogether, even in Christ, in eternity. I think priesthood merges in sonship.
Rem. So that things will be sustained in Christ in headship in eternity.
C.A.C. Quite so.
Rem. We want to get clear as to the washing first.
C.A.C. I think there is often present with saints a sense of unsuitability, having been in contact with unholy persons and an unholy scene, and we are not altogether immune from the effect of it, and if the sea were not available we should not be entirely free for service. This is provided so that we should be perfectly free to have part with Him, and to come with Him to God.
Ques. Why is the sea on the "right side eastward"?
C.A.C. I suppose like everything else in view in the temple and tabernacle it has the coming of the Lord in view; the sunrising and our being taken completely out of this defiling scene.
Ques. Is the thought of defilement connected with the laver?
C.A.C. You feel you need the precious service of Christ in the laver, because the sea is mounted on the
{212}
twelve oxen and there are the three hundred smaller oxen, all speaking of the patient and persistent service of Christ for us. The Spirit would give us a great sense of how delighted the Lord is to serve us so that we should be entirely untrammelled in the service of God, with not a thought to hinder.
Rem. The brazen altar comes first.
C.A.C. The sin question must be dealt with first; from the divine side it has been fully dealt with, of course.
Rem. He has judicially dealt with it and He would here have it morally dealt with.
C.A.C. Yes, that is true, but does not exactly come in here. We have all realised it was unspeakably precious to be made conscious that the death of Christ was between you and yourself, between you and everything connected with yourself. It was for the priests. It supposes that believers have reached the dignity of priesthood, that is, are altogether apart from the flesh in their minds.
Rem. So it is not just anyone that is washed. The vessels are characteristically brass, and their origin is significant: they were cast in the plain of Jordan.
C.A.C. There are great questions that have been settled on the divine side once for all, but they come up in detail in our everyday lives and give a sense of disqualification. Well, there is this sea. I think if we made more use of it we should be more free on Lord's day morning. There would be perfect liberty in consequence, and every heart would be free.
Rem. Say a word as to the court.
C.A.C. I think the court is the place where all these moral questions are raised. What is spiritual is found in the holy place; but this is an outer sphere where all this service goes on.
Ques. Would the laver and washing be connected
{213}
with @Hebrews 10, where the conditions are given in which we approach?
C.A.C. The allusion there is really to the consecration of the priests, when the washing of the priests is once for all; but this we can avail ourselves of at any time and at once. If we were to use it immediately we were defiled it would be a good thing to do. The washing is necessary for every part of the service really.
Ques. Would you altogether exclude this from saints when together for the Supper?
C.A.C. No, I would not like to shut out the possibility of His service at any moment, because it is preparatory service. Any lack of liberty shows something has affected us that is not of God. The Lord takes account of that and serves us. Sometimes it is a hymn that does it. A hymn sometimes is like a tidal wave of cleansing passing over our spirits. Or the Lord may use what is said to liberate us, and above all He would use the actual emblems giving a sense of His body for us and His blood poured out. It is the new covenant which is a liberating power for us; we should all go through the sea then.
Rem. It is after or during supper it takes place in @John 13.
C.A.C. Yes, I think it is instructive.
Ques. Would you tell us the meaning of the hundred golden bowls?
C.A.C. I think they are utensils of service in the holy place, representing the saints no doubt.
Rem. It is the thought of abundance again.
C.A.C. Yes. In connection with the court we get the two pillars again, which are enlarged upon. We get here the network and chains and four hundred pomegranates, suggesting, it would appear, the place in which the saints are set up by God in testimony here, as working out together the principles of christian fellowship. All this is
{214}
connected with the brass. Christian fellowship is not exactly a spiritual question, but a moral one, that is we are under obligation to be true to the fellowship; there is no option whatever about it. None of these four hundred pomegranates could break away. The pomegranates represent the saints as having a fruitful character, but I think the point here is that they are held by the network and the chains: they cannot get loose. Speaking from the moral side, it is not possible to break away from the bonds of fellowship. We are absolutely lawless if we do.
At the beginning, "They persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers" (@Acts 2: 42). I think that is like the network. Now that is the great object that God sets forth in testimony to the world, because the court is public. No one who is really in life would think of breaking away from the apostles teaching and fellowship and the breaking of bread and prayers. It is absolutely monstrous to think of breaking away, looking at the thing morally.
Rem. The doors of the court were overlaid with brass.
C.A.C. I think the doors would intimate to us there is a within and a without, and at Corinth Satan would break that down. We have a responsibility to judge not those without but those who are within; all that is a moral question.
Ques. "With all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours" (@1 Corinthians 1: 2). Does that bring in the network universally?
C.A.C. I think so. The saints are baptised into one body universally, and held together practically by the apostles teaching and fellowship and the breaking of bread and prayers. You dread anyone breaking away. If anyone breaks away it is apostasy in principle.
Rem. There is the exhortation "to keep the unity of
{215}
the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace" in @Ephesians 4:3.
C.A.C. Yes, that is really in the spiritual realm. Those who break away from the fellowship have no part in the service of God whatever; they could not have. The testimony of God has suffered terribly for many years because the principles of fellowship have been broken. The network has been broken and the pomegranates go where they like!
{216}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 4
@2 Chronicles 4: 19 - 22
C.A.C. Last week we were thinking of the vessels of brass mentioned in verses 11 - 18 of chapter 4, that they had to do with what might be spoken of as moral things, while the vessels of gold which we come to this evening represent what is spiritual.
Rem. The emphasis is on the fact that they are made of gold.
C.A.C. I think emphasis is laid on the fact that Solomon made them in contrast to Huram. The Spirit carefully distinguishes between what was made by Huram and what was made by Solomon.
Rem. It would seem from verse 18 that Solomon also made brass vessels.
C.A.C. What Huram did was for Solomon, that is, it was done under authority. So what Huram makes suggests to us the lordship of Christ. There are certain things connected with the service of God which are matters of commandment, which speaks of the authority of the Lord. In 1 Corinthians the whole epistle is summed up in this, that it is to be acknowledged by the spiritual that these things are the commandment of the Lord (@1 Corinthians 14: 37), and all moral questions belong to that sphere. So all the apostle says about the Lord's table and the Lord's supper and the ministry meetings comes under the head of commandments, and is connected with Christ as Lord. They are not exactly in the sphere of spiritual things, but of moral things that involve questions of good and evil.
{217}
Ques. What aspect of glory comes out in Solomon making the vessels of gold?
C.A.C. It seems to me more connected with the headship of Christ. It is important that we should be clear as to these things to carry on the service of God intelligently.
Rem. Certain services He reserves to Himself.
C.A.C. Yes, the whole realm of spiritual things is connected with Christ as Head.
Rem. The gifts are mentioned as well as the Head in Ephesians.
C.A.C. Yes, He does not give gifts as Head, but as the One who has ascended up far above all heavens. It is not exactly His headship there. There is a certain part of the service of the assembly on Lord's day morning, when we come together in assembly, that belongs to the sphere of commandment. That is, it is not an optional matter. No christian is at liberty to disregard the Supper. If any does so, he cannot yet know the lordship of Christ, for if he disregards the Supper, he disregards the Lord. But the Lord would have us move on to the things that are purely spiritual and connected with the recognition of Christ as Head; so it says Solomon made all the vessels of gold.
Ques. Is there any distinction between the "house of Jehovah" and the "house of God" in a moral sense, brass vessels perhaps being connected with the first and gold with the second?
C.A.C. Well, the brass has to do with the house of God too in the sense of verse 11. We can all see that if things are not right morally, there cannot be any access into things spiritually.
Ques. Would you link it with the gospel account of the Supper where after they had sung a hymn they went to the mount of Olives?
{218}
C.A.C. Yes, I think we move from the sphere of lordship to headship; there is a moment of transition.
Rem. As we sing, 'Higher and higher yet'.
C.A.C. Yes, that would be the thought. I think the way transition comes is described to us at the end of @2 Corinthians 3. What we find there is that the Lord is the Spirit of the new covenant and He quickens. In the end of verse 6 the Spirit quickens, and in verse 17, "Now the Lord is the Spirit, but where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. But *we* all, looking on the glory of the Lord, with unveiled face, are transformed according to the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Lord the Spirit". That is, we could not possibly be ready for headship till we are like Him -- unless we are like Him. How could He be Head to persons unlike Himself? He could not be. We must first come to think of God as He thinks of God. We become like Him and then we are ready for headship. It is wonderful that the Lord should give us His Spirit that we should have liberty to know God as He knows Him, and that is how transformation is effected. It says, "Looking on the glory of the Lord ... are transformed according to the same image from glory to glory". Then we are ready for headship.
Rem. There is the thought of expression.
C.A.C. Yes, I think in the glory of the Lord, that is the mediating of the new covenant, the perfect shining out in Him. But He would quicken and transform us so that we should think of God as He does. When we have got to that point in the meeting we are ready for headship. It is the Spirit of the Lord, not the Spirit of God here. It is wonderful. It is the Lord as revealed in love and grace.
Rem. Is the mount of transfiguration analogous?
C.A.C. After they received the Spirit they were transformed, but Peter, James and John were not transformed on the holy mount, because they were not like Him. But
{219}
when they received the Spirit they became like Him. That should be the effect. We often enjoy the morning meeting, and we miss all the point of it.
Rem. We need quickening.
C.A.C. The Lord can make us live in His own life, and then He can make us think of God as He does; is it not a wonderful thing? The Spirit of the Lord gives liberty so that we can be changed. Every natural thought is displaced and we think of God as He has been revealed in Christ, and we have the Spirit of the One who is the Mediator of the new covenant. He must be Head to a people who are like Him. The first thing is to look on the glory of the Lord, and we are quickened -- which is illustrated in @John 20 where the Lord breathes into His disciples -- made to live in His own life, and then we correspond to Him and are ready for headship. He could not be Head to any who were not living in His own life, and that prepares us for an order of things which is spiritual -- for the gold. If I do not walk rightly in the sphere of lordship, I cannot be in the sphere of headship.
Rem. The vessels of brass being cast in clay ground in the plain of Jordan is a striking allusion to the death of Christ, the moral question is all met in Himself.
C.A.C. Yes, every moral question has been raised and settled in the death of Christ, which is where we have to come for the solution of every moral matter. But in the spiritual realm we think of nothing relating to what has been in the mind of God on the moral line. To be risen with Christ, for instance, is not a moral question at all.
Rem. "Be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind" (@Romans 12: 2). Is that a moral question?
C.A.C. Yes, that is exactly what it is, because it is a
{220}
question of our practical walk down here.
Ques. Should we not be able to observe the Lord's movements when we are together?
C.A.C. That is very fine. The Lord is working to make us more intelligent as to the service of God, so that we may please Him. If we have known Him as the Spirit of the new covenant and are transformed and given the same outlook of God as He has, then we have to fix our attention on Him as Head.
Ques. Is it having part with Him?
C.A.C. That is just it. So we can move Godward with Him.
In 1 Corinthians the assembly is viewed in a moral setting. They were once idolatrous and were converted and set in the assembly. In Colossians it is the assembly viewed spiritually, so that Christ is the Head of the body, the assembly. So we should be exercised to take up service in the Colossian aspect. There is not one word there as to children or sons. That is because the subject of the epistle is the assembly as deriving from Christ as Head, and the thought of relationship does not come into it. It is a question of moving as having Christ as our life, and we are under His headship and therefore deriving from Him. It is a wholly spiritual conception, it is not what you can see. It is not the thought of testimony in Colossians; there it is the body of Christ for the pleasure of God -- a worshipping company. This is set forth in the tables of shewbread. There are three things in the holy place, the golden altar, the candlesticks and the tables of shewbread. They cover the sphere of spiritual things as known in the assembly.
Ques. Does it correspond more to the holy of holies?
C.A.C. The holy of holies is a further thought; you have not the ark here at all. The next chapter brings in a new subject, the introduction of the ark and putting it in
{221}
its place. But these constructional chapters are how the saints are formed for Christ. The gold is spirituality.
Ques. Why are we sometimes so cramped in our service?
C.A.C. I think we are straitened sometimes because we get into a certain stereotyped form of service, instead of having the thought of spiritually deriving from the Head at the moment, that there and then there is a suggestion from the Head. It is not what has been in our thoughts already. Then there is variety and what would come out would be really spiritual, giving more variety in the service.
Ques. What kind of variety do you mean?
C.A.C. What great variety of spiritual conceptions would there be if you think how Christ the Head thinks and feels and how His affections move Godward. It is the golden altar. It is a sphere of movement in which the Head moves Godward. He would have the assembly in accord with Him as He moves Godward.
Ques. How does He move Godward?
C.A.C. @John 17 shows how He moves Godward. The brass in separating from evil has in view the gold. And now I trust we understand the headship of Christ and how He moves Godward. There is a distinct moment of transition when we pass from lordship to headship and it is a matter of spiritual discernment.
Ques. Would the thought of the Comforter sent forth from with the Father to serve us bear on this line?
C.A.C. Yes, because the Comforter must always be on the line of the headship of Christ. One of the first acts of Christ as Head was to give Him. The recognition of Christ as Head is a movement of reverent affection, first as seeing Christ towards God, because the Head of Christ is God. And He can give fresh impressions of Himself and God. So that the golden altar, the candlesticks
{222}
and the tables of shewbread all come into evidence in the holy place. It takes form in the saints as they enter into this spiritually.
Rem. His God and ours.
C.A.C. Yes. It is wonderful to think of moving with Him. The golden altar covers all the service Godward, it seems to me. Spiritual prayers and praise are all the golden altar. The prayers of Paul in Ephesians are the golden altar, and it was a delight to God that Paul could bring out His own thoughts. He loves to have them developed amongst us and brought out in praise and worship.
Ques. Would you say that the altar and the lights and the tables are all in function simultaneously, not separately?
C.A.C. It is an assembly character of service. The three things really go together; the altar, the candlesticks and the tables all go together as spiritual elements marking the assembly, not as children of God, or sons of God, but viewed as the body, as the Colossian aspect of things.
Rem. "I in them, and thou in me" (@John 17: 21), would that not correspond with Colossians?
C.A.C. So in the tables the saints are seen as in the life of Christ. It is pure wheaten flour that the loaves are made of, with no admixture, for God's pleasure. It is really "The bread of the presence", and we have the pleasure of realising it when together in assembly; we cannot fully realise it anywhere else.
Ques. Would it be like Paul "rejoicing and seeing your order" in Colossians?
C.A.C. Yes. Order is very much connected with the shewbread, which is the saints viewed as in spiritual order before God for His pleasure, as in the life of Christ. The candlesticks give spiritual light, that is, they refer to what is ministered amongst us. The full thoughts
{223}
of God are ministered among us and all saints should look for it. All is in the Scriptures, and if the saints were to read the Scriptures spiritually they would be spoilt for all human ministry; and they could only find it where the Lord is. There is a special ministry of spiritual things and the great thing is to value it, because if we do we are on that line ourselves. The more spiritual I am, the more I shall long for spiritual ministry. All this goes to make up the service of the holy place, it is all spiritual.
Rem. Christ is "Minister of the holy places" (@Hebrews 8:2).
C.A.C. That is the priestly side of our service Godward, in which we need the support and direction of Christ in His priestly character as Minister of holy things. It runs parallel with the thought of His headship, but on rather different lines. Priesthood is official, but headship is not official, it is His personal glory. A time comes when you leave what is priestly behind and there is nothing but what is purely spiritual -- those thoughts and purposes and counsels of God that were there before ever any question of sin arose.
Ques. Would you say a word as to the doors (verse 22)?
C.A.C. It suggests the possibility of access, does it not?
Rem. There are three different doors of entry into the three parts of the temple.
C.A.C. It is clear that there is the court where the brazen altar and the sea and lavers and the pillars are found. That is the place of testimony, and answers to 1 Corinthians.
Then there is the holy place, where things are purely spiritual, answering to the saints as seen in Colossians. And then there is the inner shrine, where the ark is brought in and put in its place, the most holy place that represents what is nearest to God and what is spiritually
{224}
greatest. We shall come to that in the next chapter, please God.
{225}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 5
@2 Chronicles 5: 1 - 10
C.A.C. It is important for us to see that the house is a very enriched place. There is place in it for all that is precious. The dedicated things are obviously things that have been the product of the devoted affection of God's people. It is not the side of what is ministered to us from God, but of what is brought to God on the part of His people. And it is evident that Solomon may be viewed as representing those to whom a great deal of spiritual wealth has come down.
Ques. Do you refer to the things handed down to us by those who have gone before?
C.A.C. Yes. I think there are many precious things that have been found in the hearts of the saints, say during the last hundred years. I refer to that because that has been specially the time of recovery, and much that is very precious has been brought in and it finds its abiding place in the house of God. Nothing that is brought in having divine value should ever go out. Alas, it has been so; we find it did in the time of the apostles and others; it was allowed to be lost or stolen. But God has been working in the last century to replace many of those precious things, and they are recovered as the wealth of the house.
Ques. They are brought in as cherished in the hearts of the saints?
C.A.C. Yes, I think so. What has been received from God is so understood and valued that it has been brought into the house as the material of service Godward. Is that the thought?
{226}
Ques. Like the hymns of J.N.D. ?
C.A.C. Quite so. They express the most precious features of truth and blessing, but they express them as known in the heart of a saint, and they have become serviceable in the house, and according to our measure we can take them up and use these instruments of the saints.
Ques. Do you mean that the saints before us are represented in David, and Solomon follows on that?
C.A.C. Yes, I think Solomon is set before us as representing those who have the handling of the precious things that have come down to us, which are all to be in the service of the house.
Ques. Would there be a difference between Paul handing down to Timothy and the impressions of the Spirit now?
C.A.C. I think what Paul refers to is the truth handed down ministerially. The result of things being ministered to us is that we can minister to God. During the last hundred years the truth of the lordship and headship and sonship of Christ, and all the truth connected with the outshining of God, reconciliation and new creation; all that the saints are as the temple and as the body of Christ and His wife and brethren, and their place of sons and children -- all this has been ministered to us in some fulness.
Well, what kind of shape has it taken in our souls so that we can bring it as something to dedicate? Unless it takes form in our affections it cannot be dedicated. What we find is that much more has been ministered than we could take in, so there is not the amount to dedicate that there ought to be. Here things have been brought to completion, and all the dedicated things are there to be available for the divine service.
Rem. So that the service continues to be enriched as
{227}
saints grow in the truth.
C.A.C. Yes, quite so. There is no reason why some quite simple and unpretentious brother should not say something in the service that has never been said before; and once said it takes its place in the service of the house. Once a simple brother without gift said something that was talked about for years after. Should there not be with us some desire on that line? There are extraordinary possibilities at the present time. No saints that have ever lived had such opportunities as we, and all is granted so that the house should be enriched. So it is manifest that the house of God is a place of great spiritual wealth. Of course, the great thought in the scripture before us is the bringing up of the ark of the covenant of Jehovah into its place in the holiest of all. That is a very great matter.
Ques. Why does it bring in the thought of the dedicated things previously, and the ark after?
C.A.C. I suppose the bringing in of the ark is the crowning touch, the greatest thing of all.
Ques. It would be an assembly exercise or experience?
C.A.C. Yes, I thought so. I think it is well that we should consider the difference between the ark being in Zion and being in the holiest.
Ques. Will you open it up?
C.A.C. Oh, we are all in the matter. It is clear and it has been considered at some length, the bringing up of the ark to Zion, but that was not the end of the journey.
Ques. The ark had rest here?
C.A.C. Well, it had rest in Zion according to what we read in @Psalm 132. There we get the exercise of David, who was exercised to find out a place for Jehovah. He found the place in Zion. Verse 8, "Arise, Jehovah, into thy rest, thou and the ark of thy strength", and in verse
{228}
13, "For Jehovah hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his dwelling: This is my rest for ever; here will I dwell, for I have desired it".
Ques. So David brought it to Zion, and Solomon brought it to the holiest?
C.A.C. Yes. We should earnestly ponder these things so as to understand the difference.
Rem. We understand more about Zion than we do about the holiest of all.
C.A.C. Well, I think so. The ark on mount Zion sets forth the place that Christ secures in the assembly so far as the reign of grace is known there. It is a kingdom thought and ensures that Christ secures a very special and pre-eminent place -- that is Zion. Zion is contrasted with Sinai as a new principle, the principle of grace, and the grace of God is apprehended in power in the kingdom by the Spirit, so that a glorious place is secured for Christ in the hearts of the saints. That is mount Zion.
The thing was illustrated in the disciples in the days of the Lord's flesh, whether they entered into it much or little, they were really under the power of grace, and it secured a wonderful place for the Lord in their affections. It was feebly entered into, we may admit, but it was a reality and the Lord found rest in the appreciation of those who followed Him. It was extended after He had died and risen and been exalted and the Spirit had been given. The power was increased and the saints became the spiritual Zion, and the ark found rest there in how they cherished the thought of Him. So Zion is a good way on.
Rem. There were the godly few at the beginning of Luke.
C.A.C. I think you see souls there that have come under the reign of grace, in figure anyway, and they find their place in the assembly, and the climax is in @Acts 13
{229}
where in Antioch it says, "They ministered to the Lord". Well, that is the ark in Zion. But I should like the brothers to contribute what they have.
Then you see the glory as the Lord is apprehended in His personal distinction, because the ark does not set forth exactly anything He has done for me. It is His personal distinction and glory. He is the power and glory of God to set forth the will and glory of God. As John says, "(We have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father), full of grace and truth". It is not what He has done for us. He is the Head and Centre, just as the Lord is the Centre of the vast world of bliss that it is in God's mind to bring to pass.
We come to that in Zion and it is established in the assembly. It is a tent; all that character of service is provisional, and I trust we shall see how we can leave tent conditions which are only provisional and reach conditions that have the mark of permanency on them.
Ques. Is @Acts 13 provisional because the full truth of the assembly had not come out through Paul?
C.A.C. It is provisional because it is not the full thought of God. All that belonged to a provisional state of things. The service of Paul and Barnabas is not permanent but provisional. So that all that Christ will be in the world to come as the glorious Centre for God is a reality in the assembly, but it is provisional, it is only for a time.
Rem. There is something that surpasses all that.
C.A.C. The Spirit of God would help us to see that in this scripture. It is a wonderful thing to be brought into the kingdom, to realise the lordship of Christ in this world, and He becomes supreme. Is it possible today to find the ark in Zion? Well, I believe it is. It is where He is supreme in the hearts of His people and the Centre of the vast world of bliss; and He is worshipped so.
{230}
Rem. The Supper should be helpful in this direction.
C.A.C. I think the Supper rightly taken would secure us for that, for His supremacy in our affections as the ark in Zion, and of course He finds rest. What did He find in the disciples when they answered His question, "Who do ye say that I am?". Was that not rest for Him? And was there not something for Him when the woman of Samaria went away with Christ in her heart to speak of Him to others? He could say of it that it was meat to Him. It is rest in a provisional side of things.
When the ark is brought to rest in the holiest, He is seen to be the Centre of a system of glory that is permanent. 'Eternity's begun', as we sing; that is in the holiest, not in mount Zion. We sing it sometimes with little conception perhaps of its meaning at all. It is important to see what a vast amount of offerings were offered just at this point, intimating to us that we must entertain great thoughts of the death of Christ. It is the most wonderful moment in the sacrificial system there ever was, typifying the saints as taking on a most wonderfully enlarged thought of the death of Christ. Only in the power of that can we follow the ark into the holiest of all. I suppose during the last hundred years saints have been marvellously enlarged in the thought of the death of Christ. One of the greatest features has been the opening out of the death of Christ in its wondrous value and efficacy. In the epistle to the Hebrews we get what prepares us for the holiest and there are twenty-eight references to the death of Christ, showing how essential it is in entering the holiest.
Ques. Is there importance in the fact that the elders and priests brought up the ark?
C.A.C. It shows it is an intelligent action, calling for maturity and spirituality.
Ques. Is your thought that the ark in Zion is sufficient
{231}
to occupy us for one evening?
C.A.C. It would be good if Christ acquired the place with us set forth in the ark in mount Zion. But it is not permanent. When you come to the holiest it is permanent; there is no thought of further movement, the staves are drawn out. God is perfectly complacent, which is set forth in the cloud filling the house.
Ques. Is it too great for priesthood?
C.A.C. Yes, priesthood is provisional and not eternal. Priesthood could not function here; nothing remains but what stands connected with the will of God. It stands eternally protected. The staves refer to the time of service and testimony, not necessarily conflict. It is a backward look. Then you are altogether past the time of service and testimony. There is none in the holiest of all.
Ques. Do you get it in @Ephesians 3: "Glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages"?
C.A.C. It was just in my thought to see that the ark brought into the holiest of all has its answer in Ephesians in the prayer of Paul in chapter 3, that they might be so strengthened "that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts". That is exactly the thought. And then you get the eternal conditions, "Unto all generations of the age of ages". We sing,
<blockquote>And see! the Spirit's power <br>Has ope'd the heavenly door, <br>Has brought us to that favoured hour <br>When toil shall all be o'er. (`74:5)</blockquote>
But is it true? We touch it perhaps for a few seconds and it is a reality. That is the ark in the holiest. It belongs to the eternal, but is touched in the assembly now. We move from the ark in Zion, Christ in His supremacy, to the holiest where there is permanency. If the saints pray over
{232}
it, I think it is helpful to see that the court answers to Corinthians, and the holy place to Colossians, and the holiest of all answers to Ephesians.
Rem. It says in @Psalm 132, "This is my rest for ever".
C.A.C. "For ever" in the Old Testament is millennial, not really eternal. "Thou art a priest for ever". That means it is a priesthood that will not be superseded by another kind of priesthood. It is very important to see that "for ever" is used in a limited sense, having in view the "world ... to come, of which we speak" (@Hebrews 2: 5). It contemplates provisional conditions that have been brought in by sin, and contemplates how these conditions are perfectly met; but what meets them is necessarily provisional; it has not to do with the eternal purpose of God.
Rem. There has been much help on eternal life in this very matter.
C.A.C. Yes. Fifty years ago there was very great help. It was brought out very clearly that eternal life is connected with earth and comes in in contrast to death and sin.
Mount Zion stands in relation to what had to be overcome for it speaks of the victories of David who overcame all his enemies. So we know Christ as victorious; but that is provisional. What is eternal is connected with the eternal counsel of God before such a thing as sin and death, and it is going on eternally, and that character of things is known in the assembly.
Well, we must pray about it.
{233}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 5
@2 Chronicles 5: 7 - 14
C.A.C. This is evidently the climax of the instruction contained in these chapters. The bringing of the ark of the covenant into the most holy place would, I think, set forth how God would have the saints of the assembly to enter in a very full and blessed way into the thought of Christ as in relation to Him.
Ques. Is that an advance on the ark in the holiest in the tabernacle system in the wilderness?
C.A.C. We hardly get the thought of the saints bringing it in there; it is Moses who puts it in its place, and so it is looked at from the divine side. But in this type what is suggested is that the saints are able to bring Him into His place. It is not here that God brings Him into His place, but the saints bring Him into His place. There are priests who are able to bring Him into His place in "the oracle of the house", a word to be much noticed, because the oracle signifies that the mind of God is made known there. And that being connected with the most holy place would intimate to us that we get the fullest possible making known of what is the mind of God and that in reference to the place that Christ has before Him.
Ques. Is it "accepted in the Beloved"?
C.A.C. It is thinking of what He is to God.
Ques. Is it 'Tis Jesus fills that holy place Where glory dwells'?
C.A.C. Yes, but here we get the ability to bring Him there to the delight of God. That is the exercise of this
{234}
scripture. Can we bring Him there for the delight of God? All christians would say He is worthy of the best and highest place, but it is another thing to minister to the pleasure of God, to bring Him into the place He rightly holds in relation to God. It is the highest part of the service of the assembly.
Ques. Does "If ye loved me ye would rejoice that I go to the Father" (@John 14: 28) touch it? But that is His own movement, of course.
C.A.C. Yes, that is His own movement.
Ques. When you spoke of the difference between the ark in Zion and in the holiest, would that be the passing over?
C.A.C. Yes. One is the kingdom and the other the house. The kingdom must come first. The Lord reigns in Zion before He gets His place in the house.
Ques. The ark brought "into its place", is that significant?
C.A.C. Yes, say a little more.
Rem. If we can bring the ark into its place, would it give us capacity to apprehend what Christ is for God?
C.A.C. And I think that brings in the overshadowing by the cherubim. I think it would be of spiritual advantage if we understood the place of Christ as the ark of the covenant, as the One who makes known and secures all that is for man in the heart of God. All that is overshadowed by the cherubim.
Rem. And it is that secured in His people.
C.A.C. Yes, God's pleasure is secured by the saints moving in accord with Him. It is not exactly that it is secured in Christ, if you understand me, but it is really secured by the saints moving in accord with the greatness of Christ. Then He gets His pleasure in His people. "Jehovah taketh pleasure in his people" as we get in @Psalm 149: 4. This overshadowing thought was the primary
{235}
thought in connection with the incarnation. The angel said to Mary, "The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and power of the Highest overshadow thee, wherefore the holy thing also which shall be born shall be called Son of God" (@Luke 1: 35). That is, He is seen in relation to God. The principle of overshadowing runs right through and, I believe, into the eternal state.
Rem. God says, "Thou art my beloved Son", and we are accepted in the Beloved.
C.A.C. Our blessing is our side of it; it is not the terminus, though it is a good step on the way. This is not in @Ephesians 1 but in @Ephesians 3, "Glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages". That is the glory filling the house as we get in this chapter.
Ques. As when Moses and Aaron go into the tent, by themselves, presenting all the excellencies of Christ, is that the idea?
C.A.C. That is very important in connection with it, but it seems to me that what is suggested here is an advance on that; there is ability in the saints in their affections to bring Christ into His own proper place before God for His own delight.
We should not leave the thought of the cherubim without saying a little more about what is involved in it. I would suggest reading a verse in @Psalm 91 as giving a kind of clue to it. "He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty", in verse 1, and in verse 4, which speaks of Christ, "He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou find refuge". It is the place of Christ in relation to God. If we are able to bring Him affectionately into His own place, we must understand what it is. We have it there and in such verses as we get in @Psalm 22: 9, 10, "Thou didst make me trust, upon my
{236}
mother's breasts. I was cast upon thee from the womb". He is under the overshadowing from His very birth. It is what He is for God, not what He is for man. So all through there is what answers to the overshadowing of the cherubim. When need required it the cherubim made their appearance. On the holy mount Peter wished to make three tabernacles. The glory came down and overshadowed and would not admit this defective thought of Peter's. The revelation made to Peter was, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God". It is Christ in relation to God. It is nothing about what He is in relation to me, but what He is to God.
In Luke's gospel we find the Lord praying; He is alone praying (@Luke 9: 18). What about? I believe that the disciples might be able to discern what He was to God, so as He rises from prayer He says, "Who do the crowds say that I am?" and then, What do you say? and the answer is, "The Christ of God" -- what He is to God. Then you get the overshadowing of the ark.
Ques. Who is it referring to in @Psalm 91: 1, "He that dwelleth in the secret place"?
C.A.C. It is the general principle that the one who dwells in the secret place of the Most High abides under the shadow of the Almighty. Evidently Christ was the only One that ever did. The Spirit of God is diligent to bring it out. We are so spiritually selfish. Most of our lives are spent in thinking about what Christ is to ourselves. We shall never bring the ark into its place on that line.
Rem. You get the two sides in Romans in speaking of the resurrection. He "has been raised for our justification" (chapter 4: 25), and, "Christ has been raised up from among the dead by the glory of the Father" (chapter 6: 4) -- it brings in the glory of the Father there.
C.A.C. I am glad you mentioned that, it brings it out.
{237}
Even in death the cherubim overshadowed Him. There is the overshadowing in death, and it brings Him out in resurrection. "In that he lives, he lives to God" (chapter 6: 10). If only we thought more about this and prayed more, it would transform us. He would say to each of us here tonight, 'This is My beloved Son; I want you to be concerned about what He is to Me'.
Rem. "Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand" (@Psalm 80: 17).
C.A.C. Yes, a Man in a most wondrous relation all the time down here. The cherubim overshadowed Him all the while, in His birth, in death, in resurrection and in ascension. He was a unique Person. As sons we shall never be what He was as Son. As we think of Him in the eternal state, as we all know, He is going to be subject. "Then the Son also himself shall be placed in subjection to him who put all things in subjection to him" (@1 Corinthians 15: 28). I take that along with the overshadowing of the cherubim. He is eternally in subjection.
I have often thought that the first chapter of John's gospel begins by telling us He was God, but that also He was with God, intimating to us that He could be regarded even in the eternity past as having a place with God, indicating that He is going to have a place with God eternally. "Father, as to those whom thou hast given me, I desire that where I am they also may be with me, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me, for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world" (@John 17: 24).
Now God's thought is that we should be able to bring Him into the place that properly belongs to Him -- His own proper place with God; and if we do that we shall please God very much. That is the instruction of this chapter as I see it. We have degraded the Psalms by bringing them down to ourselves. @Psalm 91 is not true of
{238}
christians. You may fall ill and die tomorrow; how does it apply? We must put things in the proper setting in the proper time. The devil wanted Christ to apply this scripture at the wrong time. If a saint said, 'This is true of Christ', he has added immensely to the Psalm and gets very much more comfort from it than if he said, 'It is true of me'.
Rem. He speaks of "the glory which I had along with thee before the world was" (@John 17: 5).
C.A.C. He is speaking of His place with the Father before the world was, what was unique to Himself, but as the truth is developed in the Lord's prayer He speaks of another glory the Father has given Him which the saints can behold. "They also may be with me, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me, for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world". That is very like bringing the ark into its place. I think it is an immense thing to see His place with the Father. That would help us greatly to understand this chapter. To be with Me to behold My glory, that is, He brings His own to contemplate a glory which was in keeping with the Father's love to Him before the world began. What a great service in the assembly for the saints to bring Him in their affections into the place that He has in the Father's love. This is the highest point in the Old Testament and it will only be reached by saints of the assembly. No other family will go into the holiest to begin with: so it is now or never.
It is important to notice that the staves are covered as well as the ark.
Ques. What is suggested in that?
C.A.C. It suggests to me that not only was Christ personally overshadowed by the cherubim, but the saints as carrying Him in testimony are overshadowed by the cherubim. Think of what is in the mind of God, that what
{239}
Christ is in relation to Him should be carried for two thousand years in this world, for that is the divine thought, and that is overshadowed. Then in the holiest the staves are drawn out, the carrying service is over. It is the place of permanent rest for the ark. It is not forgotten that it has been carried. The staves are left there so that anybody in the holiest could see them, not put away in a box somewhere. That is, it is never to be forgotten that Christ has been carried in testimony for almost two thousand years. It is a sanctuary matter. The understanding of all this is a sanctuary matter, not a public one. We have to remember that this is the mind of God; it is the oracle. You may say, 'Where can we see it? I do not know a company that has been doing it', but that is the mind of God.
Ques. What is the idea of overshadowing?
C.A.C. I think it is protection as being delightful to God. The cherubim in the temple looked outward, as if to say, God's outlook on the universe is the standpoint of what Christ is to Him. We are brought to the very centre of God's moral universe when we see the ark in the holiest. This carrying in testimony was faithfully performed by the apostles. They actually did it. And they did not break down in their testimony. The Lord prayed that their faith might not fail. If we had the apostles with us next Lord's day, we should find they were men who could bring the ark into its proper place with God.
Ques. What is the purpose of the cherubim?
C.A.C. It is God looking out to the universe from the great standpoint of Christ. There are authorities and principalities and mighty beings we know nothing about, but they will have to come to it that Christ is their Head, and God is working at the present moment that this might become a reality before the church is translated. And that is why He had these two books of Chronicles
{240}
written, to show it is possible for it to be realised in remnant times. There is something that surpasses the Davidic order of service. The service by courses has to give place to something wider. We find in verse 11 all the priests had come out, and the Levites, the singers and the priests were all joining together "to make one voice to be heard" (verse 13).
Ques. Why is there the omission of the courses?
C.A.C. Oh, I think something larger is coming into view. The service by courses would imply the brothers taking part by turns in the morning meeting, but then there is something better than that. What is suggested in the verses here is that you come to a movement which is properly assembly service, that is the whole assembly moves as one in the service. I do not know that we know much about it, but it is the divine idea. We should always have it before us, Christ being brought into His place, and then the whole assembly moves. It is not saying 'Amen' to what one brother says. There is an assembly movement, all in a most blessed unity. And then the glory comes in.
Ques. It might be unexpressed?
C.A.C. It might be so, but there is such a thing as the heart of the saints being so unified, so absorbed in the joy of what Christ is to God, that they are charmed. It is a collective movement, and then the glory comes in. God loves collective movement.
Ques. Would that bring all together into one voice expressing what the Lord has brought us to?
C.A.C. I think that is right. That brings us to a point where priestly service ends; and we should like to reach that point sometimes.
Rem. "That ye may with one accord, with one mouth, glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ" (@Romans 15: 6).
{241}
C.A.C. That is the end, that is the thought. He is brought by His people before God, and then there is a unifying of all hearts into one voice, and the glory comes in and the priests go out. What is priestly has no more place.
Rem. The part referring to the priests is bracketed.
C.A.C. Part of verse 11 and the whole of verse 12 are bracketed to show how they were all brought into unity until they were all one. "It came to pass when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one voice to be heard in praising and thanking Jehovah; and when they lifted up their voice with trumpets, and cymbals, and instruments of music, and praised Jehovah: For he is good, for his loving-kindness endureth for ever; that then the house, the house of Jehovah, was filled with a cloud, and the priests could not stand to do their service because of the cloud; for the glory of Jehovah had filled the house of God". The glory comes in; all that is offered is ended.
Rem. There is no further room for service. God is all in all.
C.A.C. That is the idea. In John we have "I go to prepare you a place; and if I go and shall prepare you a place, I am coming again and shall receive you to myself, that *WHERE I AM* (mark that, the ark in its place), ye also may be" (@John 14: 3). You do not get the thought of priesthood there. There is a great difference between the temple and the Father's house.
So when you come to the holy city, John saw no temple in it. "The Lord God Almighty is its temple, and the Lamb" (@Revelation 21: 20). The temple drops and it is divine Persons, it is God and the Lamb; and the saints are filled with the glory of God, as has been said, God all in all. It is every vessel filled with God, and nothing can be added; you have reached finality. Is it possible for it to
{242}
be reached in the assembly now?
Rem. It would not be suggested if it could not be reached.
C.A.C. That is what *I* think.
<blockquote>'When all things filled by Thee are wholly blest, <br>And God's deep love eternally shall rest <br>In that which ever speaks to Him of Thee, <br>Thy greatness, Lord, the universe shall see'. (`293:5)</blockquote>
{243}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 6
@2 Chronicles 6: 1 - 15
Ques. Would you say a word as to the cloud at the end of the previous chapter, and later on there is the glory?
C.A.C. What is your thought?
Rem. That in general it is the symbol of the divine presence.
C.A.C. I think we connected it with the thought of "glory in the assembly in Jesus Christ unto all generations of the age of ages", a point being reached where there is nothing in evidence but divine glory. I think that should be before us as a spiritual ideal in regard to the assembly.
Ques. Does the glory bring about the cloud?
C.A.C. Yes, I suppose it was the cloud of glory; not the darkening cloud, but a cloud permeated with the radiance of divine glory.
Ques. In verse 14, why does it speak of "the glory of Jehovah" and "the house of God"?
C.A.C. I suppose the name "Jehovah" would suggest the personal way in which God is known by His saints. In reading the scripture we have the present time in view, and we regard "Jehovah" in that light. Jehovah was the special name by which God was known to His people. The thought of His name is prominent in the verses we have read this evening and there is that which answers to it in the present period, so that according to God's name so is His praise. We are concerned as to what the Spirit will give us as light as to the house at the present day.
{244}
That was only the shadow; now we have the substance.
Rem. "The priests could not stand to do their service".
C.A.C. When the divine presence is there the service takes on a more intimate character. You would hardly think of the son with the best robe upon him and the ring and the shoes, brought into the father's house, serving as a priest.
Rem. It says they "could not stand to do their service". You could consider it would be a moment of worship; they were bowed in the presence of this cloud.
C.A.C. Yes. When the Father seeks worshippers who can worship Him in spirit and truth, there is the thought of great nearness, which surpasses anything official. In the intimate presence of the glory all that is official is left behind and souls are filled with the blessedness of God. It is possible to reach that point. We sing sometimes,
<blockquote>'And filled with Thee, the constant mind <br>Eternally is blest'. (`178:3)</blockquote>
Souls filled with God are not in official service. The cloud indicates that conditions are brought about that are absolutely to His satisfaction; so that priestly service is not needed. His saints are restful too in His having carried out the purposes of His love to His entire satisfaction. I suppose restfulness will mark the Father's house rather than service. It is more the thought of "place" -- the blessing of the *place*. "That where I am ye also may be", as much as to say: 'That is all you will want'. And that is all the Father wants; His pleasure is to have them there. "That where I am", the Son says, "ye also may be". And the Father's glory rests there, we might say. And this is to show that the highest possible point can be reached by the saints when they are ready for it. It requires preparedness, but it shows that it is possible. Moses said, "Let me, I pray thee, see thy glory". He
{245}
wanted to look at it. You do not think of service when you are beholding divine glory; you are thinking purely of the blessedness of the Father and the Son. I feel I know little of it, but this I do know: it is a reality and to be known, and to be regarded as the climax of assembly privilege.
Rem. God said to Moses, "Thou shalt see me from behind: but my face shall not be seen" (@Exodus 33: 23 ).
C.A.C. The great teaching of that is that God only can be known when He has passed by. Then it becomes the privilege of faith and love to see the wonderful way He has passed by in incarnation, in death and resurrection, and in ascension.
Moses saw the whole system of divine glory bound up in the types of the tabernacle, so it was no new thing for him when he appeared in the glory on the mount; he was somewhat familiar with it. The glory is "the excellent glory", Peter tells us, and Paul is in fellowship with Peter when he says it is "surpassing glory"; that is, we have to do with a glory that exceeds everything. It is the undimmed light of the blessed God, not an obscured light. It is a cloud radiated with divine glory; it is the divine glory.
Rem. @Hebrews 1 speaks of "the effulgence of his glory".
C.A.C. @Hebrews 1 tells us He is that, and the exact expression of God's substance. It is a remarkable word meaning that the substance of God has come into full expression without any diminution; that is, there is no dimming of the light as seen in the Son. There may be that expressed in the Son which is beyond creature apprehension, but all that God is essentially and substantially is expressed by the Son.
I hope we shall not get away from the thought that this is a present object of realisation and this is the crown.
{246}
We cannot go back over the last two month's readings, but you have to put it all together to get a condition of things into which the cloud of glory can come. It is a beautiful picture of the assembly viewed as the product of divine workmanship, so that the glory can come in and fill the scene. It is a brief experience. It was a brief experience then, and I am sure it is a brief experience now, partly depending on whether we are interested. How many of us pray that we may see the glory of God when together on the first day of the week? Do we desire it?
Rem. Caleb and Joshua had the land always before them.
C.A.C. Israel were hundreds of years in the land before they built the house. It is the climax of all that is typically presented in the Old Testament, the crowning point, and it was brought out in remnant times having in mind these very days in which we are living, that we might aspire to know the reality of this in spiritual experience.
Ques. Is it a touch of what will be, God all in all?
C.A.C. Yes, for a brief moment.
The thought in chapter 6 is much more general and has to do with the public position. We have been speaking of the most spiritual elements in the christian position and privilege; but then the house can be viewed in its public position. That is what we get in chapter 6. Here he marks the contrast in verses 1 and 2. I think verse 1 is very much like the verse, "No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him", in John's gospel. There is the contrast. And in the epistle he applies it to the saints: "No one has seen God at any time: if we love one another, God abides in us, and his love is perfected in us" (@1 John 4: 12). That is, God has a present dwelling
{247}
in His saints. God has a "settled place" on earth which corresponds with His settled place in heaven.
Solomon says, 'I have built Thee a settled place here on earth'. That is clearly the thought of the house of God in its public aspect. God has a settled dwelling on earth.
Ques. Is what we have been having more the Corinthian idea of the house and this more the Ephesian side, which answers today to the public position?
C.A.C. God dwelling in His people so as to be expressed there, is that not a public matter? As in Timothy where suitable behaviour is called for, and in Ephesians where Jew and gentile are "built together for a habitation of God in the Spirit". God is bringing His people back to the thought that He has a settled place on earth. One divine Person took up His residence there, so that the divine Persons have free course. So God is to be expressed continually amongst His people. Our meetings ought to be an evidence of this, so that, as Scripture says, a man coming in reports "that God is indeed amongst you" (@1 Corinthians 14: 25). The presence of God on earth is a thing that is to be publicly known. The Lord said to His disciples, He (the Holy Spirit) "shall be with you for ever". "He abides with you, and shall be in you". That is, there is a settled dwelling place of God on earth, and He has no thought of giving it up.
Ques. Has prayer a great place in it?
C.A.C. Yes, it is brought out here. An imperfect state of things is in view, not at all like what we have been looking at. It is the public position, and our public testimony is of no value unless it gives the impression and has the mark of God dwelling here.
{248}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 6
@2 Chronicles 6: 4 - 21
C.A.C. The Spirit of God in causing these scriptures to be written evidently had in mind something very much greater than was possible in Solomon's day. He speaks more than once of things being fulfilled. In verse 4, "Who ... hath with his hands fulfilled it", and verse 15, "And hast fulfilled it with thy hand as at this day"; that is the matter connected with the house being built, and the system inaugurated was fulfilled typically though not actually. There was no actual fulfilment of anything that was in the mind of God; it all looked forward to the present time. We are by God's wondrous grace in the time when things are fulfilled, and the house, the place chosen for God's name, is built and God's name is set there. It is all a subsisting reality now; it was only a shadow then. God would have all His people to be aware of this. I think the king turning his face in verse 3 and blessing the whole congregation of Israel was typical of the present attitude of Christ. Blessing the Lord God of Israel was the response Godward, but there must be first the blessing manward.
Ques. Would it be like the Lord blessing with His hands outstretched and in that attitude of blessing taken up into heaven?
C.A.C. Yes. That is, the attitude of Christ to the whole congregation is one of blessing, and the thought of the heart of Christ in taking it up that all the saints should come into the thought of the house of God, the place, and the blessed name that is there, which were
{249}
shadows in Solomon's day, but are substance today.
Rem. In @Acts 7: 47 Stephen says, "Solomon built him a house. But the Most High dwells not in places made with hands". Then it goes on to say that he "saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God".
C.A.C. That very much confirms what was in my mind. The building of the house in a real sense depended on the incarnation of Christ and His death and His ascension, His glorification and the Holy Spirit sent down. There could not be in any real sense a dwelling place for God until then. The tabernacle and temple were shadows. It is not an empty house now, it is a house of habitation, that is, God is there. The common thought is that God is in heaven. The Lord Jesus Christ would have all His saints to understand that God is dwelling on the earth. He has a house here. Solomon understands that the house God is occupying is not great enough. He felt rightly the inadequacy of it. But things are not inadequate now, but a divine reality. It would change the whole outlook of christians if they apprehended this fact. It is as clear as noonday in Scripture.
Rem. "Whose house are we".
C.A.C. The chief interest of God at this time is His house where He dwells and where He has put His name. And the chosen place is important, because Jerusalem was the chosen place. In Deuteronomy, as we all know, God had spoken of the place where He would set His name, and where the passover was to be kept. But you do not get it till now, for in this chapter the thing is reached. We want to reach a system of things where God dwells. It should be the holy desire of every saint upon earth to be where His name is.
Rem. It would be connected with resurrection and in true Solomon character.
{250}
C.A.C. That is so. All this is connected with David, who is typical of Christ as the One who accomplished God's will. And now Solomon has taken the place of David, representing Christ as the Son of the Father's love, glorified in heaven. Not a single stone could be laid until Christ was glorified at God's right hand. The Spirit could not come, and there could be no house.
Rem. To Timothy Paul speaks of how one ought to conduct oneself in the house of God and then he outlines the mystery of piety as great.
C.A.C. Yes, showing the house in actuality is here now. It was only typically before as Stephen takes pains to say, "The Most High dwells not in places made with hands". And all christians ought to be anxious to find the place where God has set His name; there cannot be any worship without it.
Ques. What was Solomon's temple?
C.A.C. It was the figure in the time then present of what has now become a reality. God had waited long, He waited until His time came for choosing the house, a place where He could set His name. If christians are brought into this, they are clear of what is of man and become absorbed with what is of God. You cannot touch the house of God without having done with what is of man. It is what answers to Jerusalem which was the one centre to which all Israel could come. It represents God's universal thoughts of blessing in Christ. It is a subsisting thing, but we have come to it. God has brought a character of blessing for all saints -- blessing in Christ. God puts His name there.
Rem. "Ye have come ... to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem" (@Hebrews 12: 22). It is a heavenly thought while it is reached down here.
C.A.C. Quite so. We must worship God according to the way in which He is revealed and according to His
{251}
name. It covers all that God would have to be known as a matter of testimony, all He is in grace and love, and all He has purposed to be known in Christ -- that is God's name, His renown.
Ques. Would you say more about Jerusalem and His name, as a universal thought?
C.A.C. Typically it represents what is common to all the people of God. There are certain great things that are common to all saints. That is, what we are as blessed in Christ is common to all saints and is the very essence of christianity. His name stands connected with these universal thoughts of blessing in Christ. So we are all unified. We must take all the saints in. If we only take in some, we cannot take in the house of God at all.
Rem. There is no speciality.
C.A.C. And everything we can boast of is shared with all the saints. What I cannot share with them is not worth a thought.
Rem. "Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of Jah, a testimony to Israel, to give thanks unto the name of Jehovah" (@Psalm 122: 4).
C.A.C. Yes indeed. Everything in the city speaks of God's renown. This delivers us from all sectarianism, all divisions and various parties. You drop all that at once when you come to God's thought, you cannot divide about that. As the blessing in Christ is entered into by the saints, there is a dwelling for God. What is of God fills every heart, and you cannot possibly have any discord; you cannot possibly have any sects then.
Ques. Why is it Jerusalem that is chosen?
C.A.C. It is God's rest and it is expressive of God. His name excludes every other name.
Ques. What is meant by, "Who hath with his hands fulfilled"?
C.A.C. The thing is fulfilled by His power. That is so
{252}
now, the thing is actually brought into being. God is now attracting souls by an order of things that is entirely of Himself. Saints should be thankful to get away from what is of man and be absorbed with what is of God. Do we wish for anything else?
Rem. The saints are said to be narrow.
C.A.C. They are the broadest and largest people in the world. There is no human system great enough for those who love God; they must get into the house of God and the largeness of His blessing in Christ, and that is infinite. The house is composed of those who have the Spirit of sonship; Christ is the Son of the Father's love and everything has come in through Him. That is the One in whom we are blest.
Ques. Why is it, "Jehovah the God of Israel"?
C.A.C. It takes the saints to bring out what God is. If He had no saints there would be nothing to set forth His name. This wonderful system exists. If I do not know it, I must see what God says as to saints being blest in Christ and get away from what they are as in the flesh. Paul says, "I speak humanly on account of the weakness of your flesh" (@Romans 6: 19). There is that side, but it has no place in the house of God. We must look at the saints as God does, and see what He says. Now the Spirit of God would lead us into all that. Everything in His house is rightly representative of God, and anything else has no right to be there.
Rem. It presents practical difficulties.
C.A.C. We do not see them looking like what Scripture says. There is a remedy for that. If I see what saints are in Christ, I do my level best to bring all saints to see it too. Our labour is to bring them to see it. Paul says, I labour to make every man perfect in Christ. Then they will all become unified; you will not hear any more about sects and divisions then. If I have anything that does not
{253}
belong to all saints, the sooner I drop it the better; it is not worth holding on to.
The system is inaugurated in the early part of the chapter, but we must keep steadily before us that it is only in shadow. But now it is in reality in blessing in Christ, and it is for everyone to find it. It is there. God is before the soul, and the common blessing of God in Christ fills the soul. We have to think as God thinks, and speak as God speaks. It is a reality. It is God's name that everyone is absorbed with. It is the largest place of fellowship and communion that can be found. Then what comes out is that this system of things can only be maintained by prayer. The maintenance of it and the practical value of it is only secured by prayer. The whole prayer of Solomon shows he contemplated the continuance of this on the principle of dependence.
Rem. The brazen platform would suggest dependence universally, and the number five weakness and divine grace.
C.A.C. It makes one think of the Lord's utterance in @John 17. In speaking to the Father, He speaks of having manifested the Father's name "to the men whom thou gavest me out of the world". It has all been manifested in Jesus. And then He speaks of making it known -- "I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known". His name is, as it were, set amongst His disciples. That is the chosen place where it is set. And in the previous chapters how many references there are to prayer, and to the Father's readiness to answer anything asked in Christ's name. There is no shortage of power there; everything can be secured through that name. Christ as the ark of the covenant is the very centre of the whole system in His nearness to the heart of God. All that God purposed for Israel was secured in the ark. Christ is there personally and representatively; and He secures all
{254}
the purposes of God for us. "In my Father's house there are many abodes" is a distinct reference to the temple. "I go to prepare you a place; and if I go and shall prepare you a place, I am coming again, and shall receive you to myself, that where I am ye also may be". That is, His blessed place of nearness to God and the Father is for all saints. That is our place -- He is the very centre of the whole system of blessing where God dwells. It is delightful to God and He dwells there.
Ques. Would you say "I go to prepare you a place" was present, not future?
C.A.C. It will result in His coming and receiving us to Himself. Solomon's prayer is an indication to us that this great system of the house is maintained on the principle of dependence through prayer. And it is just the lack of that which has caused the departure and the giving up of the ministry of Paul and John; saints must have failed to pray. They dropped right down and the idea arose that the house of God was a building of stone. People with bibles in their hands should never think the house of God is a stone building. It is a structure composed of living spiritual material where God dwells.
{255}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 6
@2 Chronicles 6: 22 - 33
C.A.C. It would be well to keep in mind what was before us last week, that this chapter refers to the public position. The building of the house in chapters 3, 4 and 5 refers to what is inward and spiritual. It seems to me that it can only be really understood in so far as the public position is established.
Ques. Have you in mind the saints viewed as walking responsibly before God?
C.A.C. Yes, I think the city God has chosen and the placing of His name there refers to the public position.
Rem. Hence His public glory is connected with it.
C.A.C. So this chapter could hardly be understood in any sectarian position; no sectarian position would be great enough to set His name there; it must be set where His great universal thoughts as to His people are recognised.
Rem. Everything hangs on the inward side and all that is public flows from that.
C.A.C. The assembly is referred to in @Matthew 16; that evidently goes with chapters 3, 4 and 5; but there is a further reference to the assembly in @Matthew 18 (there are only two references by the Lord Himself) where it stands in connection with the sin of one brother against another, which is chapter 6 clearly and is the public side. It makes for stability if we understand these things. The great resource becomes known, as regards the public position, which is prayer. There is no reference exactly to the Spirit because that is more connected with the
{256}
inward and spiritual side. We recognise there is this because the assembly even viewed in the public position corresponds with heaven. We have to think of the public position as taken up being very small.
Rem. The public position can be established by only two.
C.A.C. It could not be by only one. In Matthew the Lord brings the matter down to two as He thinks of this very time in which we are living when it might be brought down to two. And there is authority, the Lord connects His authority with two -- ponder that! And if so, it is the most august company on the earth. "If two of you", that is, two who are intelligently of the assembly, not just any two people.
Rem. The base is in Ephesians.
Rem. So that two can take up the catholic position when two thousand not in the light of the house could not take it up.
C.A.C. Exactly, so that twenty thousand are not equal in quality to "two of you". God's name brings in responsibility, as everything must come to that standard. "And hast not denied my name" (@Revelation 3: 8). Now two can do that. There is no appeal from the decision of the assembly; no true decision of the assembly can ever be altered. It is the mind of heaven. The offender is brought to the mind of the assembly; everyone must come to it; no one is right otherwise, because it is the mind of heaven. The fact of forgiveness having a very prominent part in the chapter shows it contemplates failure in the public position; there are five references to forgiveness in different connections, showing that failure is contemplated.
Rem. There is provision for failure in any position to be sustained. "We have a patron with the Father" (@1 John 2: 1).
{257}
C.A.C. Yes, that is very important. It is as true today as when Solomon said, "There is not a righteous man upon earth, that doeth good and sinneth not" (@Ecclesiastes 7: 20). It would make me much less censorious when I thought of it; and it is in the public position because all sinned in that position. Nothing is more hateful to God than a hard censorious spirit; it is contrary to the mind of heaven. God makes provision for the settlement of all differences among His people. If @Matthew 18 were simply carried out there would be no long-standing differences between brethren. There is never any toleration of sin; God is longsuffering and does not always exert judgment in a public way, but it must be judged.
Rem. It must be judged so as not to hinder the service of God proceeding.
C.A.C. It is a question of all the resources of the house being available; we are not left to struggle along and make a mess of things.
The second matter is, "If thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee". A positive thing often arises and if so there is always a reason, for it is not by chance. I think it was illustrated at Corinth for it says they came together for the worse.
Rem. The Lord met it when He came down from the mount.
C.A.C. It is a dreadful thing when it happens. At Corinth they lost the Lord's supper, they did not have it. And so they lost all assembly privileges, because they are all based upon the Lord's supper -- they lost them all. But then there is a remedy. There was one at Corinth and they were recovered. There is no state of things among the people of God for which there is no remedy; that is the lesson of this chapter. It is the state of God's people that leads to all this distress. It led to exposure to
{258}
the power of the enemy and they are put to the worse. It gives one an immense thought of grace. However the people of God may sin and fall into the enemy's power, if there is confession of it and prayer there is a remedy.
Rem. There are examples of it in Ezra and Nehemiah.
C.A.C. Yes, they are delightful prayers.
Ques. What does verse 34 mean, "If thy people go out to battle against their enemies"?
C.A.C. Verse 34 is a very definite matter; it is going forth to meet the enemies of God to challenge them and do battle. If we think of Mr Darby, what battles he fought and won; it was a question of acquiring further inheritance, and so it is in our day. It is the enemy that is put to the worse then.
In the next section it is a question of the heavens being shut up and no rain. "If they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, because thou hast afflicted them; then hear thou in the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy servants ... and give rain upon thy land" (verses 26, 27). It means a lack of spiritual ministry. With no rain things get dried up. It is one of the ways by which God chastises and disciplines His people; He deprives them of spiritual ministry. There is a general complaint amongst pious people that there is a lack of ministry. They ought to take it to heart. If it is so in a local gathering it is a very serious matter. The Lord does not withhold any spiritual ministry from saints walking uprightly; He will see they get plenty.
Ques. Is it a question of the Holy Spirit?
C.A.C. Yes, it is and we should continually look up for spiritual ministry and for things to be preserved in freshness. Many saints at the present time are dried up. Then everything suffers, and people get into such a state that they criticise ministry. You cannot get anything from
{259}
present ministry unless you are getting showers now. What are the assemblies worth unless there is the present refreshing ministry of the Spirit? There should be the going over the whole scope of things, as the Israelites with the feasts; they went over the whole course of spiritual instruction every year. We should do that repeatedly, go over the whole course repeatedly in the meetings.
Rem. It is necessary for the younger brethren.
C.A.C. The trees yielded twelve kinds of fruit (@Ezekiel 47: 12). I am sure that is important.
Verses 28 and 29 are very comprehensive. "Whatever plague or whatever sickness there be: what prayer, what supplication soever be made by any man" (it bears out what was said in @Matthew 18) "or by all thy people Israel, when they shall know every man his own plague, and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands toward this house". Have I found the divine resource to meet my own plague? We all have that; it is no use to pretend we have not.
Rem. It is by that we learn what God can be to us.
C.A.C. Those who have been helped in plagues have an experimental sense of the grace and resource of God. I ought to know my own plague and how God has helped me. There is resource then. I think that is the great lesson of this chapter. I am not left to deal with it without resource if I have trouble in myself or in the brethren.
Ques. Is there a difference between our plague and our grief? The first would be some particular propensity of the flesh in each of us.
Rem. A man's own plague becomes his own grief, would you say?
C.A.C. Very good if it does. A grief you might have through others.
Rem. Job was under discipline as having his own grief, but God turns his captivity. A grief would consist
{260}
in a lack of knowledge of God in some way.
C.A.C. The Lord Himself was acquainted with grief. You might have griefs that are legitimate, but you want resource, otherwise you go down. It is possible for saints to get under the pressure which they may have to bear from others.
Rem. The apostle wept over the walk of some.
C.A.C. Yes, he was weeping for three years day and night, he says (@Acts 20: 31). It was a sorrowful service.
Ques. Why the reference to the way God knows the heart?
C.A.C. It is a great comfort that God knows everything. I only know partially the evil of my own heart but God knows it perfectly. I can say, 'Thou knowest much more than I do and I can bring it to Thee'. The result is, "That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, all the days that they live upon the land which thou gavest unto our fathers". It results in a life of happiness and blessing in the land.
Rem. In Hebrews it says He was heard because of His piety -- a remarkable filling out of this chapter.
C.A.C. Yes. It shows the immense provision of grace, even for what is evil, in the principle of repentance. Repentance should always be increasing with us.
Finally there is the gospel; you come to the way that outsiders are affected (verse 32). They hear of God's name as it is found among His people. It is a great thing to give an impression of God; what is my life worth if I do not give an impression of God? It is a normal thing when a soul is in exercise that it turns to the most godly person it knows. So a company with God dwelling among them should be most attractive to any person exercised in the town. It is much to be desired. I have known towns and villages where any in distress were sent to the brethren. It is a question of God's name being there. There is no
{261}
getting over it; if it is there, it is there; it is no matter of pretension. So Solomon is very wide-hearted; he goes out to the stranger and he may come "out of a far country".
Rem. Saul of Tarsus prayed before he came in.
{262}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 6
@2 Chronicles 6: 32 - 42
C.A.C. It is evident that this point in the prayer in verse 32 becomes something much greater than what has preceded; we come to the true glory of the house. In the previous sections of the prayer, the subject is the failure of God's people. There is the possibility of sinning against one's neighbour, and of Israel being put to the worse before their enemies; and then in the section from verse 26, of no rain, and of pestilence, and locusts, and various things that are the result of the failure of the people.
In verses 32 and 33, it is a question now simply of the greatness of God's name; that is clearly the glory of the house. There is no limitation at all here; it is God's great name. It says all peoples of the earth are to "know that this house which I have built is called by thy name". It is the present moment. The greatest thing about the house is that His name is set there. His name is called upon His house, and the stranger even in a far country hears that name, and comes to where that name is set. It is very beautiful. You are outside the range of any failure of God's people.
It is the mind of God given to us as light, for instruction, that we may come into the greatness of God's thoughts. The gospel is only truly presented to man as connected with God's house. It is precious light given to us in this room as to His house. In the mind of God there were no loose ends; there was only one place where God's great name was set, only one place for anyone to
{263}
go. All things have become complicated today through the wickedness of men. There is only one name, and one place, and one house. So every convert is to find his way to the place from where the light came to him. We want to get free from the darkening thoughts of men, and get back to the great thoughts of God.
His great name is purely a name of grace. His great name today is "the Father" -- a name of infinite grace and of power too. It speaks of His mighty power and stretched-out arm, that is, God moving in power for the salvation of men, His name is bound up with it, revealing all that He is in grace. It is what He is for all men; if one man was shut out it would take something off God's great name. What He has done for His people He is ready to do for all men. It is very fine. The gospel is the telling out of God's great name; to put it in one word, that is the gospel. I venture to say sometimes that His house on earth is an extension of heaven. The place where God chooses to set His name is still here in the principle of it. In the midst of a day of ruin and departure our hearts should greatly cherish a place that gives some expression of God's name. God's name is now inseparable from the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Jerusalem was a universal centre. In all your priestly relations with God you had to come to Jerusalem; and really there is only one place where God can be worshipped "in spirit and truth". It represents all saints, but they do not come to it. It is for us to come to it, and not to be narrowed and contracted in our thoughts of God's great name. A new convert turns instinctively to where he can find most of God. All the confusion has not altered the divine thought. This would bring every convert at once to God's house. Every convert ought to be there. In @Acts 2 the house was in principle there, and the gospel went out with the result that there were soon five
{264}
thousand there. There is pure light and atmosphere found there, and that is what I covet for myself.
Rem. The people rejoiced at "the glorious greatness of God" when the child was healed (@Luke 9: 43).
C.A.C. They "were astonished at the glorious greatness of God". That is the thing. The Spirit is here to establish these things; and if there are only two, they can be. If things had not come in to take away from the lustre of God's name there would have been one company. That they "may know" -- that is God's object now. If saints walk in some measure in the light of these things God's name will be known.
Rem. @Psalm 86: 9 - 12 shows this.
C.A.C. So there is a spot on earth even today where God's name is cherished and continually praised. We ought to be able to ask people if they know God's name, and go on to say where it is known. Zion is God's present attitude to men secured by the Person and victory of the Lord Jesus; but it is provisional, it is a tent. I hope this is understood.
Rem. The Psalm referred to, followed by the next two Psalms, confirms what you say. @Psalm 133 gives us the house of the Lord.
C.A.C. It is an ascending matter. If we do not understand the principle of ascension we shall not get very far. It says they brought up the ark out of Zion. It is grace, that is, the principle of law is no benefit to men or God, and He has discarded that principle. And in David He has brought in the new principle of grace and God can rest in it in Zion; but that is not the full thought of it. The thought is that God would have spiritual conditions brought about that correspond with His own thoughts of grace, so that He can be restful in conditions brought about in His house for His pleasure. You cannot get further than to be able to bring Christ into His true place as
{265}
Man before God; so that the glory fills the house. There is nothing further. The glory of God fills the house immediately. It is just as much all of grace with regard to the house.
Rem. The spirit of joy should mark us in the morning meeting, you would say?
C.A.C. Quite so. Zion's priests stand "clothed with salvation", the Psalm says, but it is God's priests here, you get to the full divine thought as in @Ephesians 2. It is to be noted how the writer dwells much on mercy and grace, but Paul brings you to the house at the end of the chapter; it is because He has placed us with the priests of Zion, and it is a full salvation, for He has clothed us and put us in the heavenlies in Christ. So there is not a question unsettled in the mind of the saint who has come to this. The thought of Zion is pure grace, unmerited favour, so is our place in eternity. On the other hand there is what is due to Christ; what He has suffered in order that there should be a place for Jehovah. It is due to Him that there should be a house.
Rem. We should be concerned about this matter.
C.A.C. I think it is grieving to divine Persons when we are not interested. If God makes a great supper and people despise it, it is a serious matter. He has given us Scripture to form our thoughts and exercises. The Father cannot forget what is due to Christ; He will never hide away His face from His anointed. His faithfulness ensures that what is due to Christ will be brought about. "He shall see of the fruit of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied" (@Isaiah 53: 11). If we reached that side, it would help us in our appreciation of grace. The house is a place secured by Christ at the cost of great affliction. This is a point, I think, that should be reached in the morning meeting.
Rem. "Let thy saints" -- the quality is, they are that,
{266}
"*thy* priests" and "*thy* saints".
C.A.C. It is very fine. How He loves to take possession of those who enter into His thoughts. How He loves to have us with Him. That is the character of the house; it is covered with pure gold -- gold of Parvaim. It is so accredited to them in perfection. So it is a very great favour if we are brought into a sphere of things altogether restful to Him. The whole church has moved entirely away from these things. There has been no ministry of them until recently, when, feeble as we are, we have been looking to enter into these things in a day of recovery. A servant of the Lord once remarked to a man, 'You have never known what it is to be an object of delight to God'. You reach a point when you get beyond what is offered, you move into the absolute repose of worship; because the priests cannot enter there.
This is the climax and it magnifies grace, and it magnifies Christ, and we are entitled to lose sight of ourselves in the presence of the transcendent grace of our God and of what Christ is. What He has suffered! It makes it due to Him that He should have brethren. "Remember for David all his affliction" and "I will not give sleep to mine eyes ... Until I find out a place for Jehovah" (@Psalm 132:4). Remember what is due for Him, on His account. We find in Scripture the darker the day, the greater and more distinctive the work of God becomes. So we have the passover improved in quality until as the days darkened they kept the feast of tabernacles, the best of all, which they had not done since the days of Joshua the son of Nun.
We find what was in God's mind was brought out in Moses song, when he spoke of "The place that thou, Jehovah, hast made thy dwelling, The Sanctuary, Lord, that thy hands have prepared" (@Exodus 15: 17). It looks right on hundreds of years to the temple. Supposing this
{267}
is secured in a few saints, here and there, what a pleasure it is to God! He takes pleasure in the quality of the thing, not in numerical greatness. We want to be concerned as to the quality.
Rem. Caleb and Joshua would illustrate that.
C.A.C. They were the remnant, and they secured the thing for God. He had more pleasure in the faithfulness of those two than He had grief in the six hundred thousand of others.
Well, there is a fine opportunity for us; surely none of us would want to miss it.

NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 6
@2 Chronicles 6: 40 - 42
C.A.C. We were seeing in the previous part of the chapter how available the Lord is for every need that can possibly arise amongst His people; and what is chiefly contemplated is sin and departure from their side, but He is able in all the power and grace of His name even to meet it. But it seems clear at the end of the prayer Solomon comes to something much greater than all that; he speaks of there being a resting-place for God. We can understand while God is answering prayer He is not exactly restful.
Ques. Why is that?
C.A.C. Well, it is simple. If there are requests, it requires some movement on His part to answer them. The crowning thought in Solomon's prayer seems to be conditions in which God can be entirely restful. And priestly conditions are brought about on the side of His people, so that prayer has ceased. The blessed God, and His saints too, are in rest.
Rem. "Ye that put Jehovah in remembrance, keep not silence, and give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth" (@Isaiah 62: 6, 7).
C.A.C. That very strikingly illustrates what has been said. When the people of God are scattered in an unrestful condition they are called to give Him no rest. "Give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth". And in prayer God delights that we should give Him no rest. Let us lay hold on Him importunately and "give him no rest"; it has pleased God
{269}
to put it that way, till we get what we ask for. But here it is the contrast to that. "And now, arise, Jehovah Elohim, into thy resting-place, thou and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, Jehovah Elohim, be clothed with salvation".
I would suggest the connection is that God contemplates failure in His people through all this prayer, but He contemplates that this prayer will be heard and there shall be recovery on the ground of which God secures a place of rest for Himself. So it comes very specially into our conditions. The climax of the thought of the house is that it is a place where He can be in absolute rest, the conditions being brought about in His people so that it can be so. Our exercise should be that the special conditions should be present that really afford restfulness to God. It is possible on the line of exercise and prayer; however far the line of departure has been, there is the possibility of recovery to His original thoughts and there is a rest for God.
Rem. In the quotation from @Psalm 132:8, David is taken up in Solomon's prayer.
C.A.C. I was thinking that we might get a great deal of spiritual help in the consideration of that. It is quoted by Solomon here, and it is Zion. See verses 13 - 18 of @Psalm 132. Zion is the place of God's rest in the Psalm, but it is something more than that in @2 Chronicles 6; and I think if we do not understand this we shall perhaps suffer some lack.
Ques. In speaking of recovery, would it be to first love?
C.A.C. I think that is so.
Ques. Do we get this in @Ephesians 1 and 2? I am thinking of "the ark of thy strength".
C.A.C. Yes, it is the full thought of salvation, and the priests are in the good of it. I think Zion is the place of
{270}
God's rest provisionally; it contemplates human need. It says distinctly in @Psalm 132: 15, "I will abundantly bless her provision; I will satisfy her needy ones with bread". And God can rest in the provision that He has made, but it is not a complete final rest; you must have the house for that. So Solomon in a remarkable way brings the thought of Zion into the house. He brings it all in, that is, he refers to David. It is David as the anointed: and it is Christ as David who has secured Zion, He has secured grace in the very place where sin and death reigned; He has secured full remission and eternal life for men. And God can rest in that, but it is to meet human need. I think @Romans 5: 20, 21 largely answers to this, to secure the reign of grace, so where sin abounded grace has overabounded to "reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord".
Rem. "Father, glorify thy name" (@John 12: 28).
C.A.C. You see how great the Father's name is to the Son. It has been given to Him for revelation, and He prays that His own should be kept in that name. He would have us bound up in the blessedness of that name. And there is only one name, so that all saints are bound up together. Here it is His great name in relation to all men; He is ready to exercise His almighty power on behalf of any human being anywhere.
Verses 34 and 35 suppose that God will send His people out against their enemies. This is the converse of verse 24. It all stands related to the house. If the church position is not understood I do not think there will be any moral power to fight the Lord's battles. In the last hundred years the conflicts have been in connection with the revived truth of the assembly. There have been great conflicts.
Ques. "And maintain their right", it says. Would that be the truth?
{271}
C.A.C. That is the thing. It is a question of maintaining what is right, thus glorifying God. Whether applying to a local or to a general conflict it is so.
Rem. Ephesians is "to stand".
C.A.C. I think it supposes the saints are in possession of the land, but they are now to hold it. We ought all to be deeply interested in the conflicts of the last hundred years because the testimony is bound up in them. In 1848 there was a conflict, a tremendous battle to establish the truth of the righteousness of God, a very great battle that J.N.D. had to fight for the church of God. We are in the good of it without perhaps understanding the great cost at which it was procured. The city represents the universal thought for all saints in which all saints have a common portion. We hold that with tenacity; it is really the truth of the assembly, that all saints are blessed in Christ in one common portion. That puts us clean outside all narrow or limited thoughts of men; it puts us in the wide range of God's thoughts. We see saints in that view; we see them all in the loaf. All christendom was against J.N.D. as he stood for it in 1848, the broad principle of the house of God as against the narrow principle of independency, a miserably narrow principle. He contended in the light of the broad principle of the church of God. Well, that is universal. There are other things, the truth of eternal life, and of the Lord's blessed sonship; these things have caused much conflict, in view of the city and the land.
Rem. @Deuteronomy 20 would help as to that.
C.A.C. We do not always spare the trees in fighting for the truth. We must be careful not to cut something down that is good; we go slashing about and cut something good down. Do not damage anything that is of God. That is a good scripture you have referred to in Deuteronomy, so that we are not to damage anything
{272}
that is good for men. I am sure Paul never cut a good tree down. He struck down strongholds and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God, bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of the Christ (@2 Corinthians 10: 5).
There is a special application for us in verses 36 - 39, it refers to a time when the people have sinned and been carried away into captivity. There is a beautiful quality about restoration. I do not want to say anything unseemly or out of order, but it seems to me that Scripture would give the thought that there is a peculiar pleasure given to divine Persons from what is restored, even in excess of what They had at the beginning. I think the land and city, and the house, acquire peculiar value to those who have been long away from them. They get a greater, richer sense of these things than those who have never been away.
Ques. Are you meaning in an individual or in a general sense?
C.A.C. It would apply in both ways, but I was thinking of the general departure specially; because the systems of men are spiritual captivity; christians in them are bound hand and foot.
Rem. Philadelphia is greater than Ephesus in that sense?
C.A.C. I doubt whether in the early days of the church there was the light there is now, or that the saints ever stood assembly-wise in the good of Paul's prison epistles. So wonderful things are coming to light now. One year now is worth more than one hundred in Luther's time. There are some saints who have taken this to heart, and they have repented and prayed, and God has granted restoration to the city and the land; and I want to have a part in it too.
Ques. Would you say what the land is?
{273}
C.A.C. The land is all that God has given to us in Christ -- a vast expanse, "The breadth and length and depth and height". The city speaks of the universal portion of the saints in Christ; and the house is where God dwells and where His name is. And we can come into all these things now, and God is glorified if we do. Now we want to come back to Paul's teaching and John's teaching. Those who have departed from Paul's and John's teaching have sinned: they may as well own it.
Rem. "Surely there is not a righteous man upon earth, that doeth good and sinneth not", it says (@Ecclesiastes 7:20).
C.A.C. Do you not feel the truth of that? We have to keep on that line; we should be very self-righteous if we did not take that line. You see how careful Paul is to distinguish between the "man in Christ" and himself naturally. He knows another man who needs to be severely dealt with by a thorn for the flesh. We all need to distinguish between the "man in Christ" and the man easily puffed up.
{274}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 7
@2 Chronicles 7: 1 - 11
Ques. What connection is there between the glory filling the house of Jehovah here, and the glory filling the house of God at the end of chapter 5?
C.A.C. It would seem to be instructive to notice the difference. In chapter 5 the glory fills the house in connection with the ark being brought into its place, and the singers and trumpeters being as one in connection with this great spiritual movement. If one might so say, it is a greater movement than what we get here, because it is connected with what is inward, with the ark getting its place in the holiest of all; it is the inward thought. But we are still in the outward position in chapter 7, with things connected with the earth. Is that not the difference?
Ques. How does that apply to christianity?
C.A.C. I think it does. The court is certainly outward. It is more in relation to things here and all the vessels in the court are made of brass as we have often noticed. That is, the brazen altar, the lavers and the pillars all have to do with what is moral, with the place where the question of good and evil has to be raised and settled.
Ques. Would it correspond with the Lord's day morning and the prayer meeting?
C.A.C. That is what I thought. It is an outward position here. We no longer have the wonderful place connected with the most holy place, but an outward place where moral questions have been settled by the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus; and the glory comes in in connection with that thought. It is lower ground; it has to do with a
{275}
place which is characterised by brass. Brass is certainly inferior to gold. It has to do with the whole scene in which we have to find our way in connection with Solomon's prayer, and we should be entangled in some evil if we did not go in dependence. If we do get entangled we are dependent on the blessed God to disentangle us. So we are all on the line of calling on the Lord out of a pure heart. It is the only way we can go on in a scene like this.
Rem. How wonderful the realisation of the end of chapter 5 must be, when the ark is brought to its place.
C.A.C. God expects the saints, in the type in chapter 5, to be able to bring Christ to His proper place in the presence of God. Chapter 5 is inward, the seventh is outward. Hence the importance of sacrifices. They do not belong to the inward position; but to the court.
Ques. Why does it say that the priests could not stand there?
C.A.C. I think it suggests there is an order of things that surpasses what is priestly. The priests were not equal to the glory any more than the Israelites were when Moses face shone. The glory has a different effect now; it brings about correspondence instead of disparity. There is something greater than service after all. There is nothing said about the service of the prodigal in the father's house. Worship is greater because sons can serve on the line of appreciating all that God is as known to them in love. There is a higher thought. "Father, as to those whom thou hast given me, I desire that where I am they also may be with me, that they may behold my glory" (@John 17: 24). That is greater surely than any thought of service.
Ques. Will that not impel worship?
C.A.C. Surely. The wonderful thing about eternity
{276}
and the eternal state is "God all in all". You do not think of service there, it is God filling all in all. This is a little pattern of it; the service is displaced, and there is nothing there but the glory. And the blessing of the saints is that they will be in the presence of the glory of God and be filled with it; this is greater than any service.
Here it is the question of the altar and the sacrifice. It is on the ground of accepted sacrifice that the glory fills the house. It is the great public evidence, the fire coming down to consume the sacrifice, and wherever you get that, it necessitates that an offering of infinite acceptability has been presented and accepted, so that there is nothing left but the glory, and this is the footing we are on tonight.
Rem. Our acceptance comes in here.
C.A.C. Let us leave our acceptance out of it; the sacrifice has been accepted; that is the point here. The sacrifices are all presented on the altar, and when Solomon's prayer is finished the fire comes down in acceptance; and on that ground glory fills the house. There is no reason now why the glory should not fill the house. What delights God is that He has accepted the sacrifice. Many have doubts and fears all their lives as to whether God has accepted them. That is not the point. The point is, has God accepted the sacrifice? The glory comes in purely on God's side here.
Rem. Solomon prayed on a brazen footstool put in front of the sacrifice, so that fire coming down on the sacrifice would imply his prayer was heard.
Ques. Is Solomon in his prayer a type of Christ?
C.A.C. I think Solomon in his prayer more represents the suitable exercises on the part of the people of God. In connection with prayer, it seems to me that David is more a type of Christ than Solomon. The end of the prayer would rather suggest that.
{277}
I suppose this enters into all our assembly service. I think what is set forth in the acceptance of the sacrifice has its place in the Lord's supper. The emblems distinctly speak of the great sacrifice He has made, for He has given His body and His blood has been poured out, and we are in the full consciousness that it has been accepted as done for the saints of the assembly. There has been an offering made of infinite sweet savour. There is, of course, very much in the Supper suggesting the Lord's personal love to the assembly, but then it was love expressed sacrificially.
Ques. Was the sin-offering ever a communal matter except on the day of atonement?
C.A.C. It was when the whole congregation sinned; but the great thought was the day of atonement, when the blood was carried in and sprinkled upon and before the mercy-seat, showing it had been accepted in the fullest possible way, so that the glory could come in. The Lord as the Mediator of the new covenant and as the Spirit of the new covenant can bring all the glory in. The house looked at from the divine side is filled with glory. It is the moral side -- the glory of His will and of His love and what He is in grace. What He is morally fills the house.
Ques. Should it have place in the Supper?
C.A.C. I thought so. The appreciation of all that is what qualifies us to offer sacrifices, is it not? Our sacrifices now are the appreciation of what Christ has done for God and for us, and that brings a sweet savour with it. What a great volume of sacrifice there is here! We find later in the chapter that the number of sacrifices is not quite so extensive as in chapter 5, but so great that the brazen altar is not large enough to receive them. That shows what God expects, that there should be so many sacrifices that it has to be seriously considered as to
{278}
whether another piece of the court should be hallowed. That is a great exercise today, for when there are more than fifty in a gathering there ought to be so many sacrifices that the altar overflows.
Rem. Twice over in this chapter we get "For he is good, for his loving-kindness endureth for ever". He is the source of all.
C.A.C. It is the highest note in the Old Testament, and you really cannot get beyond it, everything flows out of His blessed nature, and nothing is ever going to change Him. You can see how important it is that the sacrificial side should be very large with us all the time, that is, a deep sense of what Christ has done for the glory of God and to secure every blessing for us; and we bring our appreciation of it to God. God loves to have Christ praised. Every word of praise addressed to the Lord is of profound delight to God. Every bit of praise offered to the Lord has a sacrificial character. God is listening to all that we say to the Lord, to all the praise that goes out in connection with the loaf and the cup. He loves that there should be a very large measure of it. It is all connected with what came here in His Son, and with the offering of Himself.
The thought of the instruments of music for the service of song is clearly distinguished by the Spirit of God from the sacrificial service. The one follows on the other. David makes the instruments and praises by means of them; and the Levites carry on with the instruments of music; it is part of the abiding service. It is the thought of continuing the service inaugurated by David. The trumpets show that the service can be stimulated and helped on by ministry. Things are not put in Scripture without a meaning. We have been reminded lately of ministry in the assembly which would stimulate the service of song. It invigorates the service which is connected with David.
{279}
He is the great singer in the Old Testament. He wrote psalms, and skill is required for instrumental music. So the scope of praise in the assembly is very great. It covers everything contained in God being known; all that is brought in by Christ and known by Christ, and as this is brought into the assembly it is of infinite delight to God.
Ques. What is suggested in the different attitudes of the people? They fall down first; then it says they stood. The priests and the people stood.
C.A.C. Yes, I suppose it suggests they are standing in service, all linking themselves on with what was offered. So everyone would feel, 'That dear brother is saying just what I was waiting to say'. It applies to both sides, only the service of song is more extensive. It really embraces all that is known of Christ and of the blessed God, all He has purposed, promised and done. All is the expression of His nature, so He is going to show "the surpassing riches of his grace in kindness towards us in Christ Jesus" (@Ephesians 2: 7) in the ages to come. All is the fruit of His loving-kindness. It is a kind of standing note, the highest note that can be reached. David brings it in in the Psalms. Why is there such a thing as a sacrifice? It is the outcome of His loving-kindness. Why has He called His elect, called us in sonship? It is all the outcome of His loving-kindness. It cannot come to an end if all the saints are completely filled with it. So there is a blessed satisfaction for God in seeing that He Himself fills all things. That is, that God should see that He fills my heart, which is much more to Him than anything I can say, so God is all in all. There is nothing then but Himself; so that is the most profound rest of God. He fills all things according to the blessedness of the revelation He has made. Everything will be responsive to Him, because He fills everything. The God who is all in all is the God who has been revealed in Jesus in redemption in the value of what is
{280}
sacrificial. It is the God that is known in Jesus. I think really that is the thought of the glory filling the house.
Ques. Does the fat suggest what is wholly for God?
C.A.C. Yes, the sense that there is in the Lord Jesus, the Son of God, that which surpasses everything that the creature could possibly enter into, that comes out in the fat.
Ques. The fat was burnt in every offering?
C.A.C. Yes. It is a wonderful thing to realise that God is good. A young man with hard questions got them all answered in going to J.N.D., till the latter thought it might not be very profitable. So when he came with a knotty point the next time, he answered, 'I don't know. I only know one thing, God is good'. I do not know that we bring that in as often as we should.
Rem. "Let the redeemed of Jehovah say so" (@Psalm 107: 2).
C.A.C. That is good instruction for us.
{281}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 7
@2 Chronicles 7: 8 - 22
C.A.C. Now it appears in the verses read that the dedication of the house stands in direct relation with the keeping of the feast of tabernacles. It is instructive for us to see that what is due to God and belongs to His house has been secured, and the full blessedness of the saints also.
Ques. What is the significance of there being two feasts, the dedication of the altar and the feast of tabernacles? They kept the dedication seven days.
C.A.C. No, the dedication of the altar is hardly a feast. I think it shows that as the communion of the saints is divinely secured, the enjoyment of the inheritance will surely follow. It is the question of the fellowship of the assembly in this chapter. The twenty-two thousand oxen and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep were all peace-offerings. They represent how the people of God are brought into communion with the altar. So that while this immense number of sacrifices is presented to God, yet the result was that the people all participated in them. It is a participation in the common joy of the people of God and suggests the fellowship. I think really the truth of the fellowship has been set aside and broken by association with the world. So that at Corinth one would suppose there would be very few peace-offerings. It is universally deplored by all true christians that there is so little true fellowship.
In this we think of something that God could participate in; the offerer had his portion too. There is a common
{282}
portion in Christ on the sacrificial line, the great results of Christ going down into death enjoyed in common which is all connected with the altar. The sacrificial side is greatly stressed in this chapter. There are the sacrifices and the fire that consumes them, and then God says, "I have chosen for myself this place for a house of sacrifice". So the sacrificial side is very prominent. All our relations with God have a sacrificial basis and the seven days of the dedication of the altar would in principle cover the whole assembly period so that the keeping of the feast is contingent on the sacrifice (@1 Corinthians 5: 7, 8). The enjoyment of the inheritance depends on the dedication of the altar. God would fill this whole assembly period with a deep appreciation of the sacrificial side, that is, with a deep sense of what it has cost divine Persons as foreshadowed in this type. A hundred years ago the first move towards this was the liberty of the Lord's supper, before there was any sense of the assembly. It led to a great development of things and the truth of fellowship.
The altar is the climax in relation to the house. We must see that the cost to God and to Christ is immense, the sacrificial thought permeating all the thoughts of God. The brother who hands me the bread is one who appreciates it, and I appreciate it, and I hand it on to one who appreciates it. That is the fellowship. We must connect it with the altar. It is the body and blood of Christ and that is the fellowship. There are no differences in your mind, it is a company of persons thinking all exactly alike about the sacrificial value of Christ. It is the body of Christ and His blood poured out. I am only glad if you have a greater conception of it than I, because it helps me. A brother stands up to share everything that he has of Christ, and all the brethren are delighted. We want to get rid of religious ideas and get to the real essence of the
{283}
Supper and see what the fellowship really is. Millennial conditions are clearly not in view here; it is for the present time, a time when all these things are available, but may not be valued, and if so will be lost. Many have lost it permanently, and never will know it. How sad to think of. All this shows that if we are true to the fellowship there is positively no limit to our enjoyment (see @Deuteronomy 16: 13 - 15).
Rem. The people can reach God's end in Christ on the sacrificial basis.
C.A.C. The fact is that the thought of the sacrifices is limited to what Christ accomplished here upon the earth; it is not resurrection nor ascension. It so clears the ground that we can enter into our inheritance in a glorified Christ. I am afraid it is largely looked at from our side, and not from the altar side, that is God's side. But if people value Christ sacrificially there is something for God to work upon, so that they may burst their bands and come into the large liberty of the people of God.
Ques. The fellowship of the blood of the Christ, does that take you into resurrection?
C.A.C. No sacrifice was ever raised, that is the simple fact, except Isaac in figure. The whole point was what was accepted in death, and we must begin there. It is our privilege to enter into communion with God and one another by what was effected by the coming into manhood of God's blessed Son, and what He effected by going into death.
The feast of tabernacles is connected for us with Jesus glorified. It was on the last, the great day of the feast that Jesus stood and cried, "If any one thirst, let him come to me and drink" and "This he said concerning the Spirit ... for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified" (@John 7: 37, 39). That is, our feast of tabernacles is connected with Jesus glorified,
{284}
and He brings in the thought of the Spirit as linked with Him, for the great ingathering is all harvested in a glorified Christ. The inheritance is for man. The indwelling Spirit sets you up here to serve. The Lord would not take His place until the last day of the feast, which is connected with eternity. He comes publicly to the front on the last day, that is the eighth day and is connected with @2 Chronicles 7: 9. For us Pentecost and the feast of tabernacles coalesce, you might say. So we anticipate the millennium, and something better. There is no limit of time to Pentecost, so the feast is still accomplishing. We are now in the feast of Pentecost this minute. And the Spirit is the Earnest of the inheritance. "In whom we have also obtained an inheritance" (@Ephesians 1: 11), that is in a glorified Christ. And our joy depends upon our taking possession.
Rem. Colossians secures us for Ephesians.
C.A.C. That puts in a nutshell what I was thinking. Our enjoyment of the feast of tabernacles depends upon our spiritual diligence; *are* we gathering things up? It is a feast of ingathering. Very much depends on how we are walking together locally. Are we laying ourselves out that the very greatest advantage may come to all the brethren? Are we all co-operating so that they may enjoy the inheritance a little more this week than they did last week?
Rem. And so we leave our associations.
C.A.C. I think I see the typical force of it plainly, that is, the eighth day you give up all thought of dwelling in booths. There is no dwelling in booths in 2 Chronicles, and none in @Deuteronomy 16. You have to go back to @Leviticus 23 to get booths. It was to get the people to see, when in the land, that they once dwelt in booths, that is, there is to be remembrance of God's will and ways when we are in the inheritance. The eighth day is a
{285}
thought of absolute rest and fulness of joy without any thought of the wilderness. The moment we touch what is eternal all thought of the wilderness drops out of the mind. We find it so practically when in the assembly. All thought of the wilderness and God's ways drops out of our minds, and we touch an eternal order of things. We sing, 'Eternity's begun'. A blessed thing if it has. It connects us with God's eternal thoughts in Christ, and we get completely outside the wilderness and all connected with it. Booths are connected with God's wilderness ways and very temporary circumstances. The boughs of trees lasted six days at the most and then they were done with. If we could look at things that way, we should not be so concerned about little things, should we?
Rem. It was the fruit of beautiful trees that was selected (@Leviticus 23: 40).
C.A.C. They are beautiful things. You can contemplate God's care and protection as a very beautiful thing. As an illustration we could admire the shelter of God's providential care last week, that we were not touched: it is very beautiful. When we come together on Lord's day morning we touch eternal things, and should forget all that happened in the wilderness, even God's providential care.
Ques. How do we understand their returning to their tents?
C.A.C. You go from the assembly to enjoy all you have enjoyed in your household. That is the real blessing of the christian's condition. We return to our tents, very happy to keep up the enjoyment there of the joy we have had together. So it is extended all the week in our households. We are looking forward to the time when we shall not have to part. We pray and praise in our households. David and Solomon are linked together. It shows that in all that God is doing, He is thinking of Christ. It is a
{286}
question of what God is doing for Christ; He is doing wonderful things for Christ at the present time. What a wonderful thing to talk about in our households, what God is doing for Christ.
Rem. "And to Israel his people".
C.A.C. That is very good, but comes in second. Why is there such a thing as the body, the assembly? Why has it come about? Surely because it was meant for the glory of Christ. God is doing it for Christ. Why the church as the wife? Well, for the happiness of Christ, that He should have a wife. It is for Christ. God gives the sheep to His shepherd Son for His gain, and so with everything. If the King makes a marriage feast, it is for His Son. God is doing wonderful things for Christ. So the saints are beloved of God. In view of these things we should be provoked to more love and more diligence, so that the saints should enjoy the inheritance more. In Romans the saints mutually contribute. There is the same thought in Colossians, ministry flows through the joints and bands; it is a co-operating affair. I wish we were more on that line. So the body in Ephesians is self-edifying.
Ques. Would that be fellowship?
C.A.C. That is how we come to enjoy the fellowship. It is a little further than the fellowship. In @1 Corinthians 12 you get the mutual co-operation of the members to secure the enjoyment of the fellowship within.

NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 7
@2 Chronicles 7: 11 - 22
Ques. Is Solomon a type of Christ in recovering all that is connected with God's house and effecting it prosperously?
C.A.C. Certainly Christ did that, but I wondered if the side of faithfulness was not more before the mind of the Spirit, not so much Christ building the house according to Hebrews, but the responsible building as committed to man's faithfulness. I think God's answer to Solomon's prayer would indicate faithfulness on the part of those responsible for building the house. And if that is so, there would be prosperity and blessing. God is ready to accept anything that is positive faithfulness as done to Himself. It is how things are worked out in the exercises of the saints, and God prospers what is being brought about for His pleasure. It is a kind of fixed principle and God would be denying Himself if He did not prosper it. It is quite clear that Jehovah accepted what was done, and He was pleased with it; He committed Himself to it because He was pleased. The continuance of His favour and blessing would now depend on continued faithfulness on the part of His people.
Ques. To what would the king's house refer?
C.A.C. It would refer to his personal administration, do you not think? The two houses are very closely identified. In a certain way it corresponds with the house of Jehovah, for as long as Solomon maintained faithfulness in his own house, everything prospered. Later we find failure came into Solomon's house.
{288}
Rem. It is good to see it is carried through to completion.
C.A.C. The thought of God's house is not very widely before the hearts of His saints, but God has been pleased to bring it before us, and the character of things that go on there. The thing is to work it out in prosperity. We love to see prosperity in God's house. There is room for greater prosperity with us. But God cannot fail us or disappoint us if we love the habitation of His house and the place where His glory dwells. People who delight in God's habitation and know that God's glory dwells there are sure to be prospered.
Rem. There is a difficulty in the maintenance of things. Everything committed to man in responsibility started all right, at a high level.
C.A.C. Yes, we have to see the completed thought. We do not want to stop short of what is in God's mind. Those who desire to reach God's mind would not like any feature to be missing or defective, would they? We have had much ministry during the last forty years relating to the house and to the service of God. We cannot yet really say the service corresponds to the ministry; we are conscious of that. There is a good deal that stops short of God's complete thought.
Rem. In Hebrews the word is "Hold fast" and "Continue".
C.A.C. Yes. One feels what an important matter it is that there should be something God can recognise as pleasing to Himself. God chooses the place because He is pleased with it, and as a house of sacrifice, and to put His name there. What a wonderful thing it is to be going on with things that commend themselves to God, so that He can be pleased with them, His eyes and His heart perpetually there, because it answers to Himself.
Rem. A spot where things accord with heaven.
{289}
C.A.C. Yes, so in the house you could not expect to find any defective thoughts; they would be corrected. The Spirit is always adjusting and correcting; and as we pay attention things become more pleasurable to God. How wonderful to be going on with a line of things so pleasurable to God that He says, 'My eyes and My heart will not be off it for a moment'. In a day of recovery God moves by stages. He does not do everything at once.
Ques. What do you mean by that?
C.A.C. We have come out of a christendom where everything is distorted, and it all has to be corrected. The Lord's supper, for instance, is placed at the end of the service, and there is no service for God at all. Yet there is a possibility of great failure. God may withhold showers of blessing and bring chastisement, as at Corinth, because it is His assembly, and people treated it as if it was not His assembly. But then, He says, if you repent, I will listen. Sometimes it is distinctly felt that there is a lack of the refreshment of the Spirit. If so, there is something wrong.
Rem. God says, "If I shut up the heavens that there be no rain".
C.A.C. And that is what christians ought to feel, there is a terrible lack of rain, the showers are not coming down so that there should be fruit for God and the tithes brought in. God wants the state of heart that desires pleasure for Himself. If it comes into our hearts to promote what is of God, He is sure to prosper it; He would deny Himself if He did not.
Ques. Would "locusts" refer to the destruction of food? There seems to be a sort of progression here in the thoughts.
C.A.C. Yes, according to Revelation they come out of the bottomless pit; and there are many about today eating up all that is precious, including infidel thoughts
{290}
and higher criticism. We should not get away from the fact that these things are the judgment of God. If a godly clergyman dies in a place, and a modernist comes instead, it is the judgment of God on that town. From the divine side things are intended to bring about repentance. This is encouraging, for however sad and sorrowful things may be, it shows God is always ready to hear and heal. It is true for all christians, and particularly in connection with the house of God, which can only be known where the presence of the Spirit is recognised. Every person in the world who has a sense of the presence of the Spirit has some sense of the house of God. All christians should be exercised. Godly people are; they know something is amiss, but are not prepared to take the divine way of recovery.
Ques. What about pestilence?
C.A.C. I think such things do break out. It was a pestilence in Galatia, it spread over a whole province. Sometimes thoughts that are destructive are introduced amongst the brethren and God has to be sought about things, and then He comes in and gives deliverance. Even things professing to help in connection with the thought of the Spirit, such as speaking with tongues, may work against the mind of the Spirit. We have to ask ourselves, 'Do they further the present mind of the Spirit'?
God's name is called upon His house. We come back to this; the revelation of God is the great test of everything. His name is the revelation He has made of Himself, and it will be found that what is of Himself will always enlarge the revelation of Himself, or what is not of Himself will take away from it; so it is a very simple test. It is open to everyone, to all saints, to move on in what is purely of God, and in the current of the Spirit, and to find our joy in it.
Rem. God is very patient in the matter.
{291}
C.A.C. Yes, and it is good to remember it is "the well-accepted time" which does not mean the preaching for sinners, but the portion for the saints. You cannot possibly pray to God without an answer. Is it not good to be firmly rooted in that? If I have what is for God's pleasure in view, it is an absolute impossibility for God to disregard me. You are quite sure you are speaking in a way He approves of, and in His own way He will answer; for He delights in it. All this would preserve us from the terrible declension at the end of the chapter. He has to warn them what the result would be of unfaithfulness.
Ques. Would Daniel be a good example of all this, his windows open towards Jerusalem?
C.A.C. Yes, though it was a heap of ruins. People would say, 'What is the good of praying towards Jerusalem? What a silly man you are'. No doubt the Chaldeans thought so. But what was in Daniel's heart was the blessed unchanging truth that God had set His name there. That is what the outward profession of Christendom is today, a ruin, but it was open to Daniel to come back to the spiritual reality of things. The professing body of christians is on the verge of apostasy. God may use, I hope He will use, the terrible trouble coming on the so-called christian nations, that it may check the incoming tide of apostasy. It would be a great mercy from God.
Rem. God allows things.
C.A.C. The Scriptures do not speak of God allowing things. We say it, but I do not think it is the language of Scripture. We should take a great scourge directly from God, and I do not think we get any good out of it until we do.
Rem. "This thing is from me" (@2 Chronicles 11: 4).
C.A.C. The great thing is to own God in things. And faith in that day will accept things from God. The Psalms
{292}
show that even in the terrible time in Revelation, the remnant will accept things from God. A great deal in christendom today is a solemn visitation from God, such as modernism. The truth has not been valued, and God says, 'You shall have a lie'.
Rem. God orders things.
C.A.C. He does; there is a positive action of God in regard of things that are dreadful in themselves, but while the present dispensation lasts, all God's ways have behind them thoughts of grace, so long as it is the well-accepted time and day of salvation. So He preserves man's life. See how many would have lost their lives last week if the bombs had been a couple of hundred yards nearer. The reason why they did not is because it is a day of grace, and so that men shall have a prolonged opportunity to accept the gospel. We need to have it before us in reference to our failures and sins. However naughty I have been, it is the well-accepted time. I have only to pray to Him and He will hear and heal at once. What a God he is!
Rem. "Shall there be evil in a city, and Jehovah not have done it?" (@Amos 3: 6).
Rem. "Creating evil" (@Isaiah 45:7). What do you understand by that?
C.A.C. What is evil in the estimation of men. Job says, "We have also received good from God, and should we not receive evil?". The loss of his property, his children and herds was evil in that sense. There are things that are evil, such as loss and bereavement. But then God is in that sense the source of both good and evil. Hence Job's rebuke. Job's wife did not understand it. She said, 'It is high time you cursed God and died'. "Shall there be evil in a city, and Jehovah not have done it?" There might be pestilence and famine in a city. Men would have many reasons for it; but then faith has only
{293}
one reason and to recognise God in it is a great thing. What has God to say in it? If it goes across all I should like, have I such a knowledge of God that I can accept it? All His ways are in blessing; it is a well-accepted time. Even His ways in government are subservient to His grace. We need it to steady our souls. J.N.D., speaking of possible invasion of this country, said it would be a terrible scourge of God on a people who had not known war, but personally he would continue to live on the principle of confidence in God. How many thousands of lives have been preserved in the world the last two years. Houses have been completely destroyed and the people inside them never got a scratch. Now who did that?
Ans. God!
C.A.C. This is a very solemn chapter, but the encouragement that is in it is the great feature, and if something is found with us which is of God and is not of man, we may depend upon it His eyes and His heart are upon it perpetually, and He will support it. And He is not going to lose sight of it.
Rem. 'Our times are in thy hand'.
{294}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 8
@2 Chronicles 8: 1 -11
C.A.C. We can see how all this corresponds very definitely to the present time. It was a time of building.
Ques. Would it be the general thought of administration?
C.A.C. Yes. The first thing in the chapter is clearly that Solomon is a great builder and the present time is a time of divine building.
Rem. @Matthew 16 would be going on now.
C.A.C. And God is spoken of as the One who has built all things, and in Hebrews Christ is also spoken of as having more honour than the house, because He built it. We have been occupied with the house a good deal, but it is well to remember that the One who builds has more honour than the house. I think the object of the Spirit of God is to interest us in what is going on.
Rem. "Unless Jehovah build the house, in vain do its builders labour in it" (@Psalm 127: 1).
C.A.C. We have all to be made to realise that whatever we may seek to do comes to nothing except God be in it. But God is in this matter of building. The apostle says, "Ye are ... God's building" (@1 Corinthians 3: 9). It is what is going on; and it is our privilege as divinely taught to know it, so that we may contribute to what is in hand. Is that not the thought? Most religious building today is done without Christ for He is cast aside as worthless, but in true building He is the pre-eminent One. All building supposes a plan; it supposes carefully selected material. These cities are brought in to show that wherever Solomon's dominion extended this building was going
{295}
on. It might refer to local assemblies. Verse 16 comes in as if to say we must include all this building in the completion of the house. The absolute statement of completion is deferred till the end of the chapter.
A very important feature is that building should go on in all localities where Solomon's dominion is owned. It is one mark of his rule. Satan is busy on all hands in pulling down. It has continued since the work of the house began. But the administration of Christ always operates on the line of building. It is what we should seek to promote in each other. Every occasion of contact we have is an opportunity for building; there is nothing in it otherwise more than in a worldly gathering.
Rem. "The assemblies then throughout the whole of Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified and walking in the fear of the Lord" (@Acts 9: 31).
C.A.C. The assemblies were to be edified. It is a lovely illustration of the thing. We should look out for opportunities to pass on some divine thought. If something of God is built into a soul, it is to abide and form part of the city "of which God is the artificer and constructor" (@Hebrews 11: 10). What a privilege to have the opportunity of building something that will have a part in that city, for that will be permanent!
Rem. Jude speaks of "building yourselves up on your most holy faith", referring to the end of the time.
C.A.C. That is good, and exactly in line with what we are saying. Souls need to be continually built up even in what they know. We think sometimes perhaps that it is useless to speak to a brother of something as he knows it all. Never think such a foolish thought; it is simply folly.
Rem. "Let him that is taught in the word communicate to him that teaches in all good things" (@Galatians 6: 6).
C.A.C. What a person has known for many years, we might bring home to him for the first time as a spiritual
{296}
reality. He may have heard it a thousand times, and the next time it comes to him in reality. He says, 'I never saw it before'. We should never think therefore it is no good speaking of such and such a thing to someone because he knows it better than I do. Building is not limited to believers; there is material to be secured. All leads up to the full service of Solomon; all is to contribute to that, as we see at the end of the chapter.
Ques. The first building is to put the people of God together, would you say?
C.A.C. What is of God is so put in the souls of saints that they will not be comfortable until they find what corresponds, where they fit in. Many believers find they do not fit in, and deplore it. They should find conditions where they can be built in with their fellow saints so as to contribute to the service of God. It is not a lot of talking; sometimes we hinder by saying too much. It is better to say one sentence in the power of the anointing. Building involves the careful selection of material. Nothing is more delightful than to come across a heart that is ready to receive spiritual impressions. God is going on with it, so it raises the question whether I am going on with it. God is, Christ is, and the Spirit is; but are we? Are we ready and available?
Rem. The conditions are peaceful here. "The assemblies then ... had peace, being edified", it says in @Acts 9: 31.
C.A.C. I think that is it exactly. So the thing is to use the opportunity. What is built into my soul, whether much or little, is of great value, because God can use it in His building operations; and the thing is to make it as available as we can. Things are to be passed on. Timothy had to entrust to faithful men what he had heard of the apostle. Every bit of spiritual substance is to be passed on. It is to be kept moving.
{297}
Ques. They had to build with trowel and sword in Nehemiah's day. Is that true now?
C.A.C. Yes, because it is a difficult time; you cannot leave the sword at home.
Ques. The house is an established fact, but is the working out going on today?
C.A.C. Yes, it is what we generally get in these types in the temple; we see the complete thought. We have to work to it, keep it in mind. Paul says his ministry of the word of God, of the mystery, is a completed thing; but the working out of it is a different thing. The bars, gates and walls show how necessary divine principles are for the security of things; they go along with the building. The building is the establishment in saints. Paul said he longed to communicate to the Roman saints some spiritual gift to "establish you".
This extensive view is very necessary, and should be kept in mind if the thing is to be worked out profitably and practically. Divine principles are all for the safeguarding and development of what is of God in the souls of His people. The cities are very suggestive. The assembles should take on all these features, so there would be an accumulation of food and resource available in time of need, a supply in time of famine that can be fallen back upon.
Ques. Would it be like the Lord speaking to the disciples of the things "concerning me in the law of Moses and prophets and psalms"? (@Luke 24: 44).
C.A.C. It is like that, and His opening their understanding was like giving them the key of the storehouse. They are not practically available in the Scriptures, but in the saints. The angels see it in the saints. Things are to take form in the saints.
Rem. There seems to be little effect made on people.
C.A.C. We have not any experience today that the
{298}
Lord had not, and His servants. The apostles were not much thought of when they were alive, that is my thought; they were occupied in the building down here, making the storehouses. It is worked out as we are in contact with one another. It cannot be worked out with persons the other side of the world exactly.
Then it seems to me that we get the two great principles on which service goes on brought out in the use Solomon made of the Canaanites and the children of Israel -- very different principles, but both operative (verses 7 - 10). Under Solomon's dominion the most refractory and unlikely material can be used. For instance, an insolent and overbearing man, Saul of Tarsus, was subdued, and the Lord brought him under tribute, and put a levy upon him; He conscripted him. He magnifies His own grace and power in subduing him and making him tributary. Paul says necessity is laid upon him to preach; he is obliged to do it, the levy is upon him. The Lord reserves His sovereign right to take up anybody and make him serve, whether he likes it or not. The Lord shows His skill, it is the great skill of the exalted Christ and part of His glory that He can make rebellious persons contributory; and it says, "until this day". That is, the principle continues, it is always true. If we have been very refractory ourselves, we know how to deal with those who are. I have always been sorry for people who have been very pliable in the Lord's hands; they miss a great deal. I was never one of that sort, I assure you.
The Israelites serve in liberty, and take up service that involves initiative and leadership. I think these two principles blend in the Lord's servants. He would not have us forget how refractory we have been and the obligation rests on us; that is one side. The other side is, as Paul did in this wonderful dispensation of grace, to know God in liberty and love, so that we serve without
{299}
constraint. We serve in simplicity and dignity, as qualified to undertake the service. The Lord always served in the liberty of sonship. Sometimes we do a thing because our conscience will not let us neglect it. We all know something about that. It enters into the divine ways, the levy. They are brought under tribute, and must do certain things.
Rem. It says in @Matthew 11, "For my yoke is easy".
C.A.C. We are a long time before we come to @Matthew 11. We have to deal with both principles.
Rem. It should be easy to serve Christ.
C.A.C. Yes, but it is never easy to the flesh to serve Christ! The natural will is always against Christ.
Rem. Mark turned from his service.
C.A.C. Mark finishes his gospel by showing the utter hopelessness of anything of ourselves. Not one has faith and the Lord has to take the matter in hand Himself. In the last chapter there is nothing the Lord can do anything with, there is nothing but unbelief; He has to undertake the whole matter in hand.
Rem. "I will make you become fishers of men" (@Mark 1: 17).
C.A.C. And He has to make us do things often. It is happier to work on the principle of the children of Israel, who moved in the liberty of divine calling without any constraint. But the two things work together, do you not think?
Ques. Would the lordship and headship of Christ illustrate it?
C.A.C. And we are to remember it always. Do you think Paul would ever forget it in dealing with a refractory brother? He would say, 'This man is a great trial, but I know I was worse than he'.
{300}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 8
@2 Chronicles 8: 11 - 18
Ques. Have you any thought as to the two hundred and fifty superintendents? It speaks of those "which have the rule over you" in @Hebrews 13: 7 (A.V.).
C.A.C. Yes, I was thinking of that scripture; I think that is right.
Ques. How would you regard the daughter of Pharaoh?
C.A.C. It would appear that it was hardly a spiritual act to bring an Egyptian princess into the city of David. I think we should gather that Solomon entered into alliance with Pharaoh in the marriage of his daughter at a time when he did not sufficiently value the ark. It is just at the time, we are told, that the children of Israel were worshipping on the high places and that Gibeon was the chief high place, rather intimating that Gibeon where Solomon worshipped at that time was tinged with an idolatrous influence. I think it suggests to us that Solomon had been increasing in his appreciation of the holiness of the ark and of the places where the ark came, so that now he thinks quite differently about the suitability of Pharaoh's daughter being in the city of David. He thinks about it in reference to the holiness of the ark which should have been his first consideration, as it was with his father, but he does not seem to have come to it very quickly.
Ques. Does that mean that we need to review things and change our mind?
C.A.C. Yes, I think so. Solomon may represent those
{301}
who have come here positionally to the ark, without any sense of the holiness of the ark. I think that is possible. Everything connected with the house, and its service, and surroundings and associations, was intended to be governed by the holiness of the ark. If we thought just of what was suitable to Christ, it would help us in our associations, would it not?
Rem. It is well to get corrected if we have not been right.
C.A.C. Yes. I think there was gain in this adjustment. There is always gain in spiritual adjustment. The whole service of God should be taken up in an orderly way when this matter has been adjusted.
Rem. At the same time it shows it was a mistake on the part of Solomon, for she could not share in his highest services. This book was written for the remnant after Ezra's time and Nehemiah speaks of Solomon's failure in this way.
C.A.C. Quite so. It is good to see that as we exercise ourselves in relation to the house of God and His service we become more sensitive. We develop sensibilities; so that what pains at one time has to be dealt with in severity at another. You can hardly think that Pharaoh's daughter would enter much into the life of Solomon or the things connected with him. There is almost an intended contrast between her and the queen of Sheba who comes with a remarkable appreciation of Solomon and all that stands in relation to him.
Rem. It is not safe ground till Christ has the first place.
C.A.C. The ark getting its place is a very important matter. It was brought to its place, which means that Christ secures the place that is due to Him in all our hearts. It would appear that this was true with Solomon. The sense of the holiness of the ark was greatly intensified,
{302}
so that he realised that there was something unsuitable about Pharaoh's daughter coming even into the place where it had been. We need this intensified in our souls for He is "the holy one of God". It is the only thing that will give us true sensibilities and the great instruction of these historical books is that we may get a right thought of Christ as the ark of the covenant.
Rem. The apostle Paul said, "I pursue, looking towards the goal, for the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus" (@Philippians 3: 14).
C.A.C. It meant a clear cut for Paul. "On account of whom I have suffered the loss of all, and count them to be filth" (verse 8). It cost him something; there had been a severance of the things that had held him. He suffered the loss of all for Christ; they found their proper place. It is beautiful to see, after this adjustment of things, that Solomon takes up the complete service of God. The word "completion" is used in verse 16. The service of the house is brought to completion.
Ques. What is the great importance to ourselves of that?
C.A.C. There is an order of service in the assembly which is pleasing to God, and it should be our great concern that every part of it should be brought to completion. So that the offering service and the service of song go on. What we find in this section is that every detail of it is carried out according to the commandment of David, the offerings and set feasts of Jehovah and everything desired; there was not a missing link. It took a year for the whole course to be gone through by them. We are better off; we have the privilege of carrying the service through every week.
Rem. This is the highest level.
C.A.C. I think we should have that before us. The set feasts would apply to when we are together, do you not
{303}
think?
Rem. "As the duty of every day required" is stressed more than once.
C.A.C. Yes, it is very interesting, and carries us back to @Numbers 28, 29 where Jehovah calls upon His people to bring His bread and His offering. It is not to be wanting on any occasion whatever -- "day by day". "My bread for my offerings", as though He fed upon it and looked to His people to supply Him with bread, that is, some presentation of Christ. There is a fulness of things now that goes beyond what could be presented typically. All the offerings present to God something of Christ, Christ viewed as the acceptance of His people. We need to carry with us daily the sense of our acceptance in Christ. Nothing we can do will give Him pleasure if we leave that out.
Ques. "All the day shall he be blessed" (@Psalm 72: 15). It seems to cover all the commandment of Jehovah here; so should the saints have in mind the whole sphere of service, beginning with the thought of redemption to the highest point?
C.A.C. That is what I thought. The feast of unleavened bread is the first of them and that is the state of soul in which we eat the Supper, that is, the judging of all connected with the flesh, a very important element in the service of God that everything of that sort should be judged. There seems a distinct progress in the feast of unleavened bread. After that there are seven weeks of exercise before we come to the feast of weeks. It seems to bring us more to what is spiritual, would you say? It is fifty days thinking about Christ as risen and our association with Him as risen. Fifty days spent like that would do us good, and we move on from the exercise brought in by the Supper. It is brought in as a corrective matter. We move on to the spiritual side of the service, which has
{304}
to do with our association with Him as risen; it is Pentecost really. The feast of weeks supposes a spiritual order of things, a new kind of fruit for God; it is "first fruits", and the Spirit of God is connected with it, giving it all a spiritual character.
Ques. The spiritual side was hardly reached by the Corinthians, would you say? It says, "Let us celebrate the feast" (@1 Corinthians 5: 8).
C.A.C. There were conditions there that required the feast of unleavened bread to put them right. It is only as we have eaten this that we can eat the Supper. But then in our service we travel over all the ground each time we eat the Supper.
Ques. What of the feast of tabernacles?
C.A.C. Is that not the climax of the year? It is the "ingathering". It is the fruition of all the thoughts of God, and is for us set forth in Christ glorified. These set feasts are connected with Moses; the service of song comes in in connection with David. If we do not reach the crown and climax, we do not really serve God according to His pleasure. There is an order in the service which we need to be exercised about. We ought to know at any particular point in the meeting what we are occupied with, what we are doing, so that there is no disparity in the service. We ought to listen and know what we have come to in the service. I think that is rather the bearing of Solomon. He has now become spiritual and has sensibilities so that he can take the whole round of the service and there is not a stitch dropped, you might say.
Rem. In verses 12 - 16 Solomon is on a very high spiritual level.
C.A.C. Yes, I think so.
Rem. So that, the set feasts and the service of song having their place with us, the priests can function.
C.A.C. Yes, the priests and Levites fall into their
{305}
appointed place; there is an order about it. It all becomes an evidence of the headship of Christ.
Rem. David is only called "the man of God" in this connection, as he is in Nehemiah.
C.A.C. Yes, he had the understanding of the service in a special way. "They did not depart from the commandment of the king ... concerning any matter", it says. The service in that day was only a shadow; it was not anything to compare with the service today.
Ques. In what way do you mean?
C.A.C. It was only typical; in itself it did not afford God any pleasure, only by speaking of Christ. But we have to do now with the reality of things, the actual preciousness of Christ.
Ques. How would you apply the thought of "treasures" in verse 15?
C.A.C. I think they refer to things that have accumulated from the past, things come down to us. They all stand related to the service of God and have come down to us through past ministry and past conflicts, and the assembly is the storehouse where a vast amount has accumulated for the pleasure of God. It is wealth Godward; it is the whole truth of the assembly as far as it has come to us. It is there in the house as treasure and God is served in relation to it. And there is a suggestion of wealth coming in from the gentile world at the end of the chapter. God has been pleased to place great spiritual wealth amongst the gentiles. This scripture speaks specifically of the wealth of the nations.
Rem. In @Colossians 2: 2 we have, "In which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge".
C.A.C. It all contributes to the wealth that is available in connection with the service of Solomon. Every spiritual thought that God has planted in gentile hearts is all additional to the work. More has come in from the
{306}
gentile than God ever got from the Jew. A great store of gold is found in Edom, as in store in the gentile world. God had it always in His mind that there should be great spiritual wealth found among the gentiles. And I suppose that is why the queen of Sheba comes in at this point, showing the great spiritual wealth with the gentile, for she comes up with great wealth. She was needed as completing the divine thought, that there was not only found one in Solomon that could build the house and carry on the service and bring all to completion, but there is a woman found who can appreciate it all; she can estimate it all in reference to Jehovah. The setting out of God's mind would not be much for His pleasure if there were no hearts to appreciate it.
Rem. It is normal for appreciation to increase all the time.
C.A.C. It is delightful to think of every word that contributes to the service of God.
{307}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 9
@2 Chronicles 9: 1 - 12
C.A.C. It is very comforting to be assured that whatever riches of glory are made known in Christ and wrought by His work in human hearts will bring about what corresponds with it and can appreciate it. I suppose Solomon is the type of Christ that is unique; there is no other type like Solomon; indeed, that is true of every type. There are not duplicates, and every type has its own unique presentation of Him; and spiritual intelligence and appreciation largely depend on our diligence in tracing out the beauty and glory of Christ in the types. But then the queen of Sheba is unique too.
Ques. In what way?
C.A.C. Well, as representing a capacity to appreciate all that was found in Solomon. She is brought in in that way, is she not? I think it shows that if there is a peculiar glory set before us in Christ it needs a peculiar character of divine working in souls that it may be fully appreciated.
Ques. Does the fact that she was a gentile suggest this working among the gentiles? The effect on the magi was a wonderful work.
C.A.C. Yes, and they had to do with Christ, we might say, in a small presentation.
Ques. Is this connected with the quotation from Isaiah in @Revelation 21: 26, "And they shall bring the glory and the honour of the nations to it"?
C.A.C. Yes, it is; but it is even greater because there is a spiritual quality about this in a typical way.
{308}
Ques. How does the Lord comment on this in the gospel? He spoke of Nineveh and then of the queen of Sheba. What was in His mind?
C.A.C. I suppose He had in mind the two great divine realities, that is, He was going into death, set forth in type in Jonah; and He was about to enter into His glory too. It was all there; His qualification to be glorified was all there, though they did not perceive it. What has come to us in the glad tidings is the fame of Christ glorified. The question is whether it has affected us in the same way as the queen of Sheba was affected by the fame of Solomon.
Ques. Is the subjective side brought in here, in it being a woman?
C.A.C. So that there was something that was excellent, suitable to Solomon and appreciative of his affairs. How good to know God is working that there should be something in relation to Christ glorified, true appreciation of Him glorified. The queen of Sheba is looked at as representing the work of God. She does not come as a poor sinner, as saying,
<blockquote>'Nothing in my hand I bring, <br>Simply to Thyself I cling', (`396:3)</blockquote>
but she comes loaded with the choicest possible things, such as had never been seen before.
It is a question here of thoughts and enigmas which were in her heart, that no one could solve but Solomon; that is, she is a thoughtful person: I do not think that God takes much account of thoughtless people.
Rem. Christ is the answer to every question.
C.A.C. Yes, that is so. He is the wisdom of God. It is like a picture on the wall, until we come to Him. It is what is presented by the powerful testimony of the Spirit -- Christ glorified.
{309}
Rem. The question with us is whether we really take this journey and bring our questions.
C.A.C. It would have been very interesting if we had been told some of her questions. I have no doubt her enigmas would all be in relation to the true God and would flow out of the acquisition through the fall of the knowledge of good and evil. While they got it from the fall, it was a most wonderful acquisition -- Adam and Eve by the fall were far superior to what they were in innocence. Do you think that?
Rem. I do not know that we can all take it in!
C.A.C. There was a greater moral capacity. As fallen, this wonderful capacity came in for them. It is a capacity that would make us all very thoughtful, if we are true and sober, for there are a thousand enigmas connected with it.
Rem. We need to get our questions solved first.
C.A.C. It liberates us to contemplate an order of things that cannot be improved, and indeed we know what it is to be brought into connection with a scene that is in perfection and with a blessed Person in control, where everything is operating in love. There is no improvement on that. Think of the glorified Christ -- I have sometimes thought of it with wonder -- the One who is far above all principality and power and dominion and every name that is named, image of the invisible God, Heir of all things -- to think that He is at liberty to pay attention to what is in my heart, any question and problem that I have! Now the glorified Christ is waiting to be at our service in the same way; is it not marvellous? Every question relating to good and evil is of profound interest to a glorified Christ. It is for the want of these exercises that men are perishing without Christ. Whatever I have found in Christ is a permanent thing. You cannot suppose the queen of Sheba did not carry her
{310}
impression of Solomon and all his affairs back with her.
Ques. It is something like Colossians, is it not?
C.A.C. I was thinking of Colossians, because the great thought of Christ as Head is wisdom to direct and to be the source of supply; but the great thought is wisdom.
Rem. She had no reserves at all. She spoke with him of all that was in her heart.
C.A.C. She found out he could explain it all to her. In Colossians they were in danger of bringing in human solutions to their enigmas, philosophy and vain deceit, men spinning cobwebs out of their own brains. Well, that is not good. I suppose what the queen of Sheba brought to Solomon expressed her appreciation of his glories. We might think that we have nothing to bring; but we have. We can add something that no one else can bring to Christ. I can add something that no other creature in creation can -- my own appreciation of His greatness and glory. That is not adding to Him, but is our own appreciation of His greatness and glory. It shows very clearly that she had an extraordinary sense of his glories. Think of a company of saints sitting down together, and in every heart a God-given sense of what Christ is and what He is on God's behalf; what wealth that is! With the women in the gospels, like the woman in @Luke 7, and Mary in @John 12, there was a profound sense of divine love as expressed in Him.
Ques. Have you any suggestion as to what the spices and gold and precious stones would mean as presented from her side?
C.A.C. I think it typifies the sense in the soul of the worth of Christ. We were expressing it just now, 'Thy worthiness we sing'. How precious that is. How precious to Him that in a world where men do not look to Him for anything, we should look to Him for everything with a
{311}
sense that it is all there. Yes, it is in manhood, that all this comes out. It is a blessed Man, who is the wisdom of God, the power of God, the expression of the glory of God, and the image of God. So if we understand, we see there must be an answer to every moral exercise, to every question that springs up in each individual heart.
Rem. We need to have the Person brought before us.
C.A.C. We lack in this; we are content with a general statement which the gospel brings. We accept it, we do not question it; but it is quite another thing to draw near to the One we have known in the glad tidings. It is a different thing to find out that He can tell me all about my exercises as to God and as to good and evil, and wishes to be the answer to me, so that I have my own individual experience with Him. And this would set us free. If we get personal exercise met, it sets us free to contemplate an order of things where all is perfect. I am afraid many believers have very little conception that there is at the present time an order of things that is so perfect that it could not be improved upon. They think that will be in heaven.
Ques. What do you mean by that?
C.A.C. All that we get here -- the house that he had built, the food of his table, the deportment of his servants and the order of their service, and finally the ascent by which he went up to the house of Jehovah. It was all in such perfection that it did not leave anything to be desired. Do you not think that it is our privilege to enter upon such an order of things, such as was in His mind when the Lord said, "I will build my assembly, and hades gates shall not prevail against it" (@Matthew 16: 18), because that is down here? It would hardly be said, "Hades gates shall not prevail against it" in heaven. Because it is His house, "My assembly". That is not the same thing as the house of God. The persons are the
{312}
same, but in a different setting.
It is a thing to ponder in our hearts before God, if there is a structure where there is not a single element that is not the handiwork of God. Is that not what is needed to keep us really bright? Otherwise we get under the dulling, deadening influence of the depressing conditions of the general ruin of the christian profession. I feel the need of it myself. We can resort to something only apprehended in the light of a glorified Christ; because it is a glorified Christ that builds the assembly. If I have it, I want to look round for other hearts in it too; then we can walk together in the light and blessedness of it. It is not so easy as you might think to get away from the area of imperfection. You get outside the area where you have to be constantly considering good and evil. In our responsible life and history we never can get away; it faces us at every step and turn. But there is a sphere connected with Christ glorified which is excellent and cannot be improved upon. It is all His handiwork.
Ques. "There was no more spirit in her". What does that refer to?
C.A.C. I suppose it is there is no movement of desire. She has reached, as J.B.S. used to put it, the region of satisfied desire. Is it not in that sense? If we reach the ordering of the house, if we contemplate that, we have an entirely different standard by which to estimate everything. We need to be exercised about it, that it is not merely a picture on the wall to us as we have been saying. We want it to work out; for instance, "the food of his table"; we may be sure in Christ's house where He has His way there will never be any shortage of food.
Rem. I suppose all this, the food of his table, and the deportment of his servants, even these things reflect the glory of Christ.
C.A.C. Yes, there is unquestionable wisdom about it
{313}
all. The word "deportment" is generally translated "dwelling"; it is the place they occupied, that is, the wonderful favour that was conferred upon them in having a position in relation to his service. She says, "Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, who stand continually before thee and hear thy wisdom". She was struck by the blessedness of the place they had in relation to such a one; and the order of service of his attendants, and their apparel, I suppose, would apply to all the ordered service in the assembly viewed as Christ's assembly. Everything is in perfect order; you would not find an evangelist trying to be a teacher, or anything like that, would you?
Rem. "If any one of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God", it says (@James 1: 5).
C.A.C. Yes, practically we need a great deal of exercise to get away from our thoughts and man's wisdom. In christendom, there is an order of man's wisdom. We want to get away to the liberty of an order of service where everything is of Christ. As to the "apparel", I suppose personal suitability is required. All is taken account of in the walk and ways of those that serve, that no discredit comes upon the service. It speaks of "in everything commending ourselves as God's ministers" (@2 Corinthians 6: 4).
Ques. What are the "cupbearers"?
C.A.C. It is remarkable that the cupbearers are mentioned before his ascent to the house of Jehovah. It suggests that we minister first to the joy of Christ. His cupbearers would literally hand him wine; and I think the Lord has been exercising us for some years about the importance of ministering to the joy of Christ, before He moves to the ascent to the house of Jehovah. The Lord looks for His portion. Sometimes we are in too much of a hurry to get on to the service of God. It would be greatly enhanced if the cupbearers came into evidence.
{314}
Oh, what a privilege we have on Lord's day morning when we have eaten the Supper together, which brings Himself before our hearts, because He says, "This do in remembrance of ME". What are we to do next? Well, minister to Him -- minister to His pleasure; and then we can join Him, as it were, in this wonderful ascent. He goes up (it is from his own house) to the house of Jehovah; and I think in a sense that is how the thing works in the assembly. One would covet to have a deep sense of the preciousness of it all. She is filled with it, and finds it exceeds all that she heard, and pronounces everyone happy in this wonderful circle; and finally she blesses "Jehovah thy God".
Rem. And she knew the delight that God had in him.
C.A.C. Yes, indeed.
Rem. It says, "King to Jehovah", not to the people.
C.A.C. Yes, she understood that he was filling the office entirely for the pleasure of God. That is when we come together, so that whatever is the product of divine working in Christ is all for the pleasure of God, so that God may be "all in all" ultimately. Oh, it is wonderful!
{315}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 9
@2 Chronicles 9: 9 - 21
C.A.C. We cannot but notice that the thought of superlative excellence is very largely brought out by the Spirit of God in this portion of Scripture, that is, in referring to the fact that in verse 9, "Neither was there any such spice as that which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon", and in the end of verse 11, "And there were none such seen before in the land of Judah", and at the end of verse 19, "There was not the like made in any kingdom". That in itself would serve to remind us of the character of the present time.
Ques. What particular bearing would it have on the present time if it is a millennial period?
C.A.C. I think if we could forget it was a millennial period for an hour it would not be a bad thing!
Ques. You mean it is all substantiated in Christ as glorified?
C.A.C. And in the saints. You could not say that the millennium is the time of superlative excellence in the ways of God.
Rem. Like the queen of Sheba, we shall have to say that is a hard question; we cannot understand it.
C.A.C. As regards the ways of God with the earth, of course the millennium will be the crown, it will be the sabbath. But a wonderful period has come in which excels that in a spiritual way. The present time is the period when God is bringing souls to appreciate Christ glorified, and to have links with Him that are more precious and more wonderful than any links people on
{316}
earth will have with Him in the millennium. But really the assembly period is the most wonderful period in the ways of God as bringing out things in a most excellent character such as never were before, or ever will be again. There never were before and never will be again such offerings to Christ or praise to God as are going on at this present time.
Ques. Would @2 Corinthians 3 bear on it, the glory that surpasses, and the Spirit of the new covenant?
C.A.C. Yes, that is what I was thinking, and the supremacy of Christ is known today by the saints of the assembly, of course speaking of it from the divine side, as any of us may stop short in our knowledge of things. According to the divine mind there is an excellence attaching to this dispensation not known before or after, whether in relation to the saints, or if we think of it in relation to Christ. I suppose the spices, choice spices, surpassed everything else, and the sandal-wood, of which none such had been seen before, typifies what is secured in the saints; but the "great throne" speaks symbolically of what is secured in Christ.
Ques. Do the three things suggest what is formative in the queen of Sheba, as she receives impressions of Christ?
C.A.C. Yes, I think the secret comes out here of how these precious things are produced.
Rem. One feature of importance at the present moment is that this divine work goes on in the saints, and the results for God are seen correspondingly.
C.A.C. And I think all christians would like in a general way to yield what is fragrant -- the spices -- but we do not always go the right way to secure it. The spices of superlative excellence carry us back to the holy anointing oil, as we read in @Exodus 30: 22 - 25. It was put on the tabernacle and the ark and the vessels and, in
{317}
verse 30, on Aaron and his sons. The fragrance of it was put on everything that belonged to God.
Ques. Would you say exclusively Christ and the church?
C.A.C. Yes, it was not to be imitated, or put on the flesh, showing it spoke of certain spiritual features that could not be found in the flesh. How wonderful to think that at the present time God is working that features of superlative excellence should come out in the saints under the influence of Christ.
Rem. The spikenard of Mary of Bethany was the result of sitting at His feet, being under His influence.
C.A.C. I think it is to bring out that the effect of acquaintance with Christ is that all this spiritual fruit will come out in us. The thing to pray for is not this grace or that grace, but the thing to pray for is acquaintance with Christ. Many saints are desirous of developing features that are spiritual and pleasing to Christ, but work from their own side in the matter; but the thing is to become acquainted with Christ, and these things come out, one might say, naturally.
Ques. Then does discipline come in so that the spices may flow forth?
C.A.C. Yes; it comes in to help. It is the people who are going right who get discipline, not those who are going wrong. I remember once saying to J.B.S. of a brother who went sadly wrong: 'Will he not get some terrible discipline?' 'No', he said, 'not till he goes right -- then he will'. That is, discipline comes in to help us, to help us in what we really desire.
Rem. The branches are pruned to bear more fruit.
Ques. What is the difference between 'acquaintance' and 'communion'?
C.A.C. Communion is a word not found in Scripture in the common use of it. People speak of 'being in
{318}
communion' and of 'holy communion', meaning when they are happy; and when they are not, they are 'out of communion'. Scripture does not use the word in that sense at all; there is no single example of it. Now God affects us by bringing Christ within the range of our knowledge, as He brought Solomon within the range of the queen of Sheba's knowledge. And I think I would not be wrong to say her spices were the result of her knowledge of Solomon. She heard by report of him and brought the gold and precious stones and spices. It is not whether we are 'in' or 'out of' communion. It pulls us up as to how much we know of Christ. What is Christ to me? How do I know Him? In what way have I come to apprehend Christ? Some will say, 'Very little'; so there will be very little spice or sandal-wood. It is all developed in the soul -- what God communicates of Christ to the saints. The Spirit of God uses a unique word as to it, showing the impossibility of translating it. But what was it that produced it? It was Christ who produced it. I feel more and more we need to pray for acquaintance with Him. Paul prays, "To know him" (@Philippians 3: 10), after he had known Him twenty-five years and more. If I know Christ something very excellent will be developed in me. There is the fruit of the Spirit in Galatians and there are the beautiful features mentioned in Colossians; and things are coming out now in the church period that surpass anything that will come out in the millennium, and that is the Spirit of the glorified Christ. All Scripture is transformed if you read it in the light of a glorified Christ.
I suppose the spices represent these precious features that are developed in the saints down here and will not have any place in heaven. There will be no place in heaven for forgiving and forbearing one another in love, nor if you have a complaint against anyone at the present
{319}
time. Forgiving is a delightful thing down here; I would not like the thought of it in heaven. These things are brought out under the influence of Christ. Let us pray that we may be more under His influence and that He may be more to us. These incomparable spices come out here. And we know how we are tested, not when things go as we like, but when things are contrary. Do the contrary things bring out Christ in you? I feel I cannot say much on that line.
Rem. These things are mentioned after a person is settled.
C.A.C. Yes, every moral question is settled.
Rem. She gave the king these things.
C.A.C. Then I think the sandal-wood is a further thought, because it is evidently material that provides for upward movement. Solomon used it (there was none such seen in Judah) for the stairs (verse 11). In each case it has to do with upward movement. The highest possible feature of going up marks the present time. The language of Scripture is very simple after all. A child can understand that stairs mean going up to a higher level. Spices have to do with what comes out, if you may say so, on the ground floor. That is, if under the influence of Christ these incomparable graces are coming out in us during the week, should we not be wonderfully free to go up the stairs on Lord's day morning and use the instruments? Sandal-wood is material that lends itself to the service; it represents what the saints are as made to live by the One who is in heaven.
Rem. It is striking that in Colossians after the features mentioned there, it goes on, "Singing with grace in your hearts to God".
C.A.C. Yes, it is the going up, is it not? The spices are really preparatory to going up. If I have been bad-tempered or self-willed during the week, I must not think
{320}
of going up on Lord's day. It would only be artificial if I attempted it. If we are not right on the level where these graces display themselves in circumstances of contrariety, we cannot go up. We sometimes forget the process of self-review that would enable us to judge them, so that we should be delivered from them. It is wonderful to think that we have been made to live by a glorified Man in heaven, who is the last Adam. Whether I have taken it in or not, that is the truth. And this constitutes us the "heavenly ones". That is like the sandal-wood, it comes from a far-off clime; and as the saints understand, they have been quickened by a glorified Man. If He quickened me, what has He quickened me for?
In the principle of it in @John 20, He is ascended, and He breathed into them, showing they were to live of His life, and that is how we become heavenly ones, as quickened and made to live by the heavenly One. If so, I can go up, and I can sing, and use the instruments. It is an ascending movement. Who can go up unless he understands he is quickened for heaven? It was a wonderful thought when it first dawned upon me. Saints here in the millennium will never have that, God will never get it from them; but God is getting it from His saints today. It is a matter of life, because it is "quickened", or "made to live". The point is that to enjoy it, we have to shake off the things that weigh us down to earth. We have to be shaken up. The patriarchs sought a heavenly city, but they did not know that heaven was their native land.
Ques. It is remarkable the harp coming in. Does it show how sensitive it would make us if we understood?
C.A.C. And the harp is the only instrument in heaven, is it not?
Rem. I suppose acquaintance with Christ makes us sensitive.
C.A.C. We cannot get anything in any other way. The
{321}
thing is to awake from among the dead and let Christ shine on you. The secret of everything is to be in the shining of Christ. These are things to pray about, rather than to discuss.
To continue our chapter, the house of the forest of Lebanon is an important matter to take account of. It is obvious there are three houses; the house of Jehovah, the house of Solomon and the house of the forest of Lebanon. They are described to us separately, and the assembly answers to all three of them. We may think of the assembly in its relation to God, that is the house of Jehovah; in its relation to Christ -- "My assembly", He says -- that is Solomon's house; and then the house of the forest of Lebanon is characterised by the presence of all these shields, showing it represents the defensive position.
Ques. Why are the shields of gold, not brass?
C.A.C. I suppose to give us to understand that the defensive position can only be held in a power that is of God; we know gold represents what is purely of God, as is seen everywhere in the house. So these shields are placed in the house of the forest of Lebanon, and characterise it. Paul is set. He says "I am set for the defence of the glad tidings" (@Philippians 1: 16), and "In the defence and confirmation of the glad tidings ye are all participators in my grace" (@Philippians 1: 7); he says to the Philippians, as it were, 'I am in the house of the forest of Lebanon, and so are you'.
To stand in defence of what is of God is really a greater thought than getting people converted. The apostle lays that down as the great principle of his life, "I am set for the defence of the glad tidings". The glad tidings represent the whole cause of God in this world, and speak of most wonderful things being made known by God; and the saints here are to stand in defence of
{322}
them. As long as Paul lived there was one spot at any rate on earth where what was precious to God was defended. He was an old man in prison, he could not move about, and he says, "I am set for the defence of the glad tidings"; and his Philippian children were all set for it too; they would not be moved by any influence from the gospel as brought by Paul to them. There are times when it is most important to stand on the defensive, using the target all the time.
Speaking generally, there is a very widespread idea of getting people converted; but they may be converted in such a way that they have very little knowledge of what the thoughts of God are. Men should know what the thoughts of God are, to witness of what God is, that is the great thing, and I think the house of the forest of Lebanon represents this side of things. It is the testimony set up here as to what is in the mind of God, to be held against all opposition, against all that is adverse.
Ques. Would it be the care meeting?
C.A.C. Yes. It should be worked out in every kind of service. There may be few at the preaching but it is a wonderful thing that God and all His thoughts for man should be asserted and maintained in the face of all the darkening thoughts in this world: it is something for God. The children of Israel gave up their aggressive action, and very soon their defensive position, and succumbed to idols. And so it has been in christendom; things have dropped to a very low level because the defensive position has been given up. A very great part of J.N.D.s service was the defence of the glad tidings against modernism, ritualism and worldliness. It was given to him to restore to the church Paul's gospel, and having preached it, he stood in defence of it all his days; and he has given to us the privilege of occupying the house of the forest of Lebanon.

NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 9
@2 Chronicles 9:17 - 31
Rem. You gave us help last week as to the materials used, the gold and sandal-wood, perhaps you would say a word about the ivory?
C.A.C. I do not know that I could give the precise meaning of ivory as a symbol, save that it represents material that has passed through death.
Ques. You refer to the animal being killed in order to procure it?
C.A.C. Yes, a wonderful suggestion surely in connection with the throne.
Ques. How do you connect the thought of death with the throne?
C.A.C. It suggests it was in the thought of God that supremacy should be taken up by One who has passed through death. It is almost the last thing Solomon is said to have made, and it was no doubt the crown of the typical teaching; it was clearly symbolical.
Ques. Is there any connection with @Psalm 45? There is a throne in connection with ivory there, and a quotation from that psalm in Hebrews, where the throne is brought in in connection with the death of Christ?
C.A.C. In the psalm it would seem to be in relation to the saints, for it says, "Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made thee glad", that is, the saints as ministering to the joy of Christ are really material that has come out of death, which brings in the thought that the King has companions, and as He has passed through death in order to have companions, the companions
{324}
have also passed through death in the appropriation of His death, and also in the experimental realisation that death is upon themselves. Is it not so?
Ques. Is it more in connection with the stability of His thoughts?
C.A.C. Yes, it goes back to the original thought of God in creating man. God's original thought comes out in @Genesis 1: 26: "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over the whole earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth on the earth". The thought of God in creating man was that he should have dominion. But as we know, instead of the first man maintaining the place, he came under the dominion of sin and death himself; and from that moment it became necessary, if God's great thought was to be carried out, that Another should come in, so there should be a Son of man who could take up for God everything the first man had failed to maintain.
Rem. We get that in @Psalm 8. So Adam would be a figure of Him that was to come.
C.A.C. Yes, and it is well to remember @Psalm 8 is quoted in @Hebrews 2 and the Spirit of God adds something to the psalm for He adds the thought of the Son of man being made inferior to angels on account of the suffering of death, showing that in the ways of God death must come in as the ground on which the Son of man takes up universal supremacy. I think that is symbolically made known to us by the Spirit of God from the fact that the throne is made of ivory.
Rem. It says "A great throne".
C.A.C. Yes, it must necessarily be that when we think of the greatness of the Person who is to occupy it. He is not only Son of man, able to take up all God's thoughts as
{325}
to man and bring them to fruition, but in order to do so He must needs be a divine Person. So it is evident in the reference to the Son of man that none could take that place but a divine Person, as suggested by the ivory covered by pure gold. The Lord seemed to cherish the title of Son of man specially. In the gospels He refers many times to this title; but He makes it clear that He was a divine Person for He speaks of the Son of man ascending up where He was before. He is a divine Person because He was a divine Person before He came. The witness was that they should see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power (@Matthew 26: 64), so He appropriates to Himself what belongs to Jehovah. These thoughts are essential to any divine conception of the throne. It is occupied by the Son of man who is clearly a divine Person and it is due to Him in every way that He should have the place of supremacy in the universe of God; and He is the One we look upon as now crowned with glory and honour. It is characteristic of the dispensation that we should look upon Him in all His suitability and fitness to occupy the universal throne. I think Stephen is the pattern; his confession was that he saw "the Son of man standing at the right hand of God". You see these thoughts are stupendous and yet we cannot think rightly of the throne in a divine sense without taking them in. I have often considered christians as a whole do not think enough of the Son of man. We are very much more familiar with the thought of Him as the Son of God. I am including ourselves, and myself in particular. Do you not think so?
Rem. I am afraid I must confess to that.
C.A.C. It is important we should not allow one or even more aspects of the truth to obscure other aspects of the truth. Satan has from the beginning, I suppose, used certain parts of the truth to obscure other parts.
{326}
Ques. Why do we get the title Son of man frequently in Ezekiel?
C.A.C. Well, because Ezekiel was chosen to be a minister of the glory.
Rem. There seems to be a marked correspondence between Ezekiel and the gospel of John.
Rem. The Lord speaks more of Himself in John as Son of man than as Son of God.
C.A.C. So that in John, where we see Him most in His glory as Son of God, we see Him in His positional glory as Son of man. We see the importance of dwelling on every character in which the Lord is to be known; and in connection with the throne it is particularly as Son of man. It is important for us to apprehend Christ in that character; it is the particular character in which He exercises judicial functions in regard to the assemblies. It is as the Son of man that He walks in the midst of the assemblies; that is, in standing in relation to the assembly we have to do personally and directly with the Son of man. So it is not a past title, but a present title; and it is a future title, for it says, "The Son of man shall sit down upon his throne of glory" (@Matthew 19: 28). But we have to do with Him now as Son of man -- this minute. He is walking in the midst of the candlesticks exercising discrimination in the assemblies. He exercises the function of the throne in relation to the assemblies. It is essential to the whole position. And the throne in connection with Solomon is spoken of as the throne of judgment. We are told in Kings that he built a porch of judgment. It is not with the thought of punishment, but of divine appraisement, of appraising things at their true value. So that He appraises all He can in the assembly. This presents the function of Christ in relation to the assembly. At the same time He says what does not please Him, and we have to do with the Son of man in that character.
{327}
Rem. In @Hebrews 1: 18 it says, "A sceptre of uprightness is the sceptre of thy kingdom". The whole kingdom is to be administered and held according to God.
C.A.C. And it is going to be so actually. What a comfort that is as we look around at the confusion in the world; because the moral confusion is greater than the material confusion, terrible as that is, and we should feel it. The moral state of man away from God and under Satan's rule and under death is a dreadful thing. We need to feel not only the political confusion, but the moral confusion. Now who can adjust this moral state? The Son of man, who will sit on His throne of glory. The first thing He will do will be to adjust every moral question; and He is doing that now in the assembly, it is a present action now by the Son of man.
Ques. Will you explain what the steps are?
C.A.C. I think there is nothing more beautiful than to think of the steps up to the throne. There are six steps, indicating that the One who occupies the throne has reached it by a certain progress, by certain stages He has had to pass through to get there; and it endears and magnifies Him to our hearts, so that we worship Him.
Ques. What about the seventh step?
C.A.C. It requires the seventh step to complete it. The throne is the seventh step.
Rem. God reaches His end in it.
C.A.C. The end God has in view upon the earth is the Son of man upon His throne, and He will reach the throne because the throne here is not occupied. The steps fall into a certain setting in my mind. To speak very simply, God has introduced Christ into the world by prophetic testimony, that is, I think, the first step. It covers the Old Testament. The others follow quite simply, though they are stupendous in their character. The next is incarnation; it is an immense step. The Old
{328}
Testament prophecies bring out His character, His sufferings and death, and His glory, but what a wonderful step up this is, and all in view of the throne, of His being in the place of supremacy. The incarnation is the beginning of the working of it all out in manhood, "taking his place in the likeness of men, and having been found in figure as a man" (@Philippians 2: 7, 8). He could not have been Son of man otherwise, for His humiliation here was on the way to the throne; we must never forget that. His lowly pathway of obedience led to the throne. Then there was His death, His accomplishment of redemption, that was most essential; He could never have been Son of man without that. Then His resurrection and His ascension. These are all steps to His throne. I do not think that is fanciful; they are divinely laid-out steps to the throne. And there is one step left to come, and that is His coming again, the sixth step. It seems clear to me that all that is presented in the Scriptures indicates the steps by which the Lord Jesus is going to reach the place of supremacy in the universe of God.
Rem. It says He will take the throne of His father David.
C.A.C. But the title Son of man is unlimited, it extends to the whole human family. I think the Spirit of God would have us ponder these things. It has pleased God to give them to us symbolically so that we may take them in better; because it fixes it upon us as interesting our minds as well as captivating our hearts.
Ques. Will you say more about the throne being unoccupied?
C.A.C. It was left to us to put the only Person upon it who could fill it.
Ques. Why is the footstool of gold fastened to the throne?
C.A.C. I think the throne and footstool go indissolubly
{329}
together, which is important to notice. We have various scriptures which speak of the Lord's enemies being made His footstool. He is sitting at the right hand of God until His enemies are made His footstool; is that not what marks the present period? That is, anything which refuses His rights will have to submit; and that is a principle applying to you and me, so everything that rebels in our flesh now will be made His footstool. We must learn to make every action of the flesh subjugated to His footstool. Until this is brought about, as the psalm says, there can be no thought of worshipping at His footstool. It is a mockery to talk of worshipping Him unless I am subjugated to Him.
Ques. The throne is the centre of the whole realm. Which is greater, this or the ark?
C.A.C. Oh, well, the ark is greater, I think, if we can venture to compare divine things, because the ark is fully on the divine side. The great thought in the ark is that there God speaks, "There will I ... speak with thee" (@Exodus 25: 22). That God should speak to us and reveal Himself to us is greater than the throne. But we must not weaken the character of the kingdom; it is the superlative character of the kingdom; there was not anything made so great in any kingdom. In all the precious types there are no duplicates. Every type stands in its own majestic solitude; it has its own voice; we must not mix them up. The ark is the inside position, and the throne is the outside. The thought of supremacy is connected with the throne and I think we need to cherish the thought; we are so apt to lose sight of it. And yet we see all this carried through with unassailable divine power. We see by the lions a power that cannot be defeated or turned aside from its object.
God would have us deeply impressed with the thought of the majesty of Christ. Peter says,
{330}
"We ... having been eyewitnesses of his majesty". We like to think of His power, His grace and His love to poor sinners, but we need to ponder His majesty; it is connected with the throne. I think Matthew's gospel gives us the thought of the throne; He is born King in Matthew. How much the Spirit of God can compress into a few sentences. These are matters for enquiry, and He expects us to be sufficiently alert to enquire into them, so that we can move on in the intelligence of these great and wondrous things.
Ques. Arms were on each side of the seat; would it suggest the idea of rest? The Lord has arrived at that place and nothing more is required.
C.A.C. Yes, that is good. Both the arms and the footstool would suggest a restful position.
{331}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 13
@2 Chronicles 13: 1 - 22
C.A.C. I suppose this is one of the most encouraging chapters in the book.
Rem. It comes in as a great joy after the departure of the previous chapters; yet God was preserving something for Himself.
C.A.C. Every reader of this book has noticed that the principle of recovery runs right through it, seen first in Solomon himself and ending with Cyrus rebuilding the temple. It is the whole history of recovery. It is most encouraging for us today that God gets something for Himself, even on the line of recovery. Even Solomon failed and the great movement of recovery was necessary with him. That is why there was a delay of some years after he comes to the throne. Not much is seen in Rehoboam, but he does humble himself and obtains mercy from Jehovah; he is not destroyed altogether. It is remarkable that in the end of verse 12 of the previous chapter it says, "Also in Judah there were good things". It is in the same chapter where they had all departed from the law of Jehovah; so if good things were there it was on the principle of recovery.
I suppose Abijah is perhaps the most striking instance of recovery that Scripture affords. If we read in Kings, he is seen to be a man of concentrated evil; but here he is a man of faith, fully recovered to divine order and principles and the service of God, so that all is set up in its original perfection as ordered by David. Even the severe discipline in Rehoboam's time had not the slightest effect
{332}
on the son, so there must have been a remarkable movement of recovery for him to take up the place he does in this chapter.
All God has done from @Genesis 3 until now has been on the line of recovery. When all is over, then God comes in on His side. Abijah goes back to the original order. He says, "Ought ye not to know that Jehovah the God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever" (verse 5). You ought to know that. He goes back to Christ. If we want to get the good of it ourselves, we have to go back to Christ. God has vested all rights in Christ, and whatever does not acknowledge that is rebellion wherever it is found.
Rem. "Whatever promises of God there are, in him is the yea, and in him the amen, for glory to God by us" (@2 Corinthians 1: 20).
C.A.C. Yes. Abijah says, 'You ought to know this man is a rebel'. The whole principle of recovery is to come back to the original. Faith will always revert to the lordship and headship of Christ, to anything that God has set up. Anything not in line with that is rebellion; faith looks at it like that, and where there is rebellion you cannot possibly have the service of God. Division is the government of God on the sad state of departure. If the lordship and headship of Christ had been held and the presence of the Spirit recognised, there would not be anything like the state of things today.
Rem. The reference to "a covenant of salt" is striking. Salt is preservative.
C.A.C. Nothing can invalidate it. Even when evil has come in or whatever government of God, nothing invalidates that, all the rights are vested in Christ. Faith reverts to that and the whole principle of recovery is there. And you get man-made priests, in verse 9; what is not of God, there is no value in it, for it robs Christ and is all connected
{333}
with idolatry. Wherever you get the thought of priesthood in a human way it is always connected with idolatry.
Rem. Abijah is greatly outnumbered but God supports him against tremendous odds.
C.A.C. When God has recovered the truth in any measure, the whole religious world has always been against it, with its false priesthood. You cannot stand against overwhelming odds without God. The whole service of God was set up, it was in going order, which reminds us that it is necessary that, if we are to meet the powers of darkness and apostasy, we must see to it that the service of God is carried on in its completeness. It is much greater than all the power of Jeroboam and his golden calves and vast number of chosen men. Abijah could speak about the priests and Levites and all the precious service going on; "The Levites are at their work", he could say. So that I think the Lord has been exercising us for a long time that the service should go on in all its features; that we should return to the lordship and headship of Christ, and that the service of God should go on in a spiritual way and in power. And then the enemy cannot do anything, he is powerless. There is plenty of machinery to keep things going in the religious world.
Rem. The first thing mentioned is the burnt-offering.
C.A.C. Yes, and that is dependent on the priests of Jehovah. The true priesthood comes to light and the reason of the ministry of the last hundred years is to bring them to light. The priesthood is found with those who are kindred with Christ; nothing of the flesh can come into the true priesthood.
Ques. Would the thought of the loaves set in order upon the pure table mean that all the people of God are in mind?
{334}
C.A.C. All these things are not the portion of a few saints, but properly the part of all saints. If only a few are interested enough to take up priesthood, it should make us all the more keen to take it up.
Rem. "The kingdom of Jehovah", it says; it is remarkable.
C.A.C. Yes, and in a sense all this going on was only the normal way of things in a spiritual way. Even a small number of saints may take up these things in function and action, so that there is something going on superior to all there is in christendom.
Ques. Would you say more as to the burnt-offering, what it is?
C.A.C. It is the conscious sense of acceptability in Christ preserved continually in the souls of the saints, so we begin every day with a conscious sense of that which nothing can invalidate, and it is just as good at the end of the day as at the beginning. That is the meaning of household prayer; it is the sending up of the savour of Christ to God. Also the sweet incense, I suppose, would suggest the continual intercourse of saints with God in prayer, as being in the mind of God as to His will in Christ. We are in happy intercourse with God about it. If in the true vein of recovery we ought to be conscious that we are simply going on with what is of God, and it is a simple reality, day in and day out. Yes, it needs purpose of heart, I am sure that is right. Then the loaves are in order on the table.
Ques. Would that mean things are in moral order?
C.A.C. Yes. Everything in our spiritual history with God depends upon our sense of acceptability being preserved daily in the soul, and then we pray on that basis, our intercourse is based on it. Then the loaves are on the pure table. We view all the people of God in the life of Christ apart from flesh altogether. It became food for the
{335}
priests, but then it was the 'bread of the presence'. Well, that is the saints in the life of Christ before God. Is it so? If it is so, then Christ is multiplied in the saints. Every saint is an extension of Christ.
Rem. "According as ye are unleavened" (@1 Corinthians 5: 7).
C.A.C. Quite so. We take account of saints as in Christ, not according to flesh. Some are naturally nice, and some are naturally nasty, but we are to look at them in Christ. They are sealed by the Spirit and stand in the light of redemption, and are in the life of Christ. Perhaps they do not know it, but do we know it? The thing is to bring all the saints to where we are ourselves.
Then there is the candlestick, that is spiritual ministry. We ought to be able to say we know something of the verity of all these things, not merely that they are in the Scriptures, but to be able to say it in sober reality, in the very presence of God, calling God to witness that we do not lie. It is wonderful that this can be in the presence of the darkness of christendom. We know (we ought to be able to say we know) that there is a present ministry of Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit, that we know these precious things connected with Christ in the presence of God. We ought to be able to say it on oath if necessary. In spite of the confusion in christendom, over against that there is the light of the candlestick, the Spirit's ministry of Christ as a glorified Man in the presence of God and all He has brought to pass in Him. If I am not in it, I am a pitiable object.
John's gospel was written for the last days -- when he was about a hundred years old -- when christendom was in as great confusion as now. It is there we read about the Comforter and His testimony to Christ, and His guiding the saints into all the truth. It is wonderful to think of a man able to speak so confidently and in such sober conviction, when he had been living amidst gross evil and
{336}
departure for years.
Verse 12 seems to be a military verse. If God's service is maintained within, there is power without. It says, "We have God with us at our head", in the sense of leadership in conflict. What are eight hundred thousand men if God is with us?
Ques. Is there not mercy in the alarm being given?
C.A.C. Yes. The effect of the priests being there and the trumpets sounding is that the people go into battle with a shout of triumph; they have not a thought of defeat in their minds, and it was all a question of relying on God. "Because they relied upon Jehovah the God of their fathers". They did not set up to be anything in themselves.
Rem. In verse 12 there is an appeal to the other tribes, "Children of Israel".
C.A.C. There was the opportunity for all Israel to recognise the same things.
Rem. Abijah took cities from Jeroboam.
C.A.C. That is what we are after, we want to take as many cities as possible out of the hand of Jeroboam. There are thousands of true saints under the rule of Jeroboam; we should like to see them delivered and brought into the true place of saints. If we are able to say what Abijah said as to the recovery of divine order, and the carrying on of divine service, we would like as many as possible to have a share in it. They are just as much entitled to it by divine calling and we want them to enjoy it all. Abijah is a very interesting man in the light of recovery. I think it would be interesting if we could read the treatise of the prophet Iddo giving the whole history of such a man. It is a hint put in here to remind us that the full book of chronicles is being written in heaven, and we shall have to wait till we get there to read it. This is to remind us that there is a very great deal more than
{337}
we have in the Bible. It would be very interesting if we had the treatise of Iddo.
Rem. We do not have a complete record of the Lord's sayings; @John 21: 25 tells us that.
C.A.C. No. We have not one-thousandth part of them! They are all in the church; the apostles had all the words of the Lord and all His acts, so certain members of the assembly are acquainted with them all, and will share with all the other members of the family by-and-by. We shall all share in it. The Spirit of God says, Now there is a lot more.
{338}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 14
@2 Chronicles 14: 1 - 15
Ques. Does this chapter show a continuance in measure of the period of prosperity under Abijah?
C.A.C. Yes, it is so evidently.
Rem. There is a good deal said of rest, but not the service of God that marked the previous section.
C.A.C. Yes, it is not quite on the same high level as the economy in the previous chapter. Asa was marked by a great degree of faithfulness; we find him dealing with all those things which were not consistent with the service of God.
Ques. Would you speak of what he did as spirituality, or piety?
C.A.C. He was walking faithfully. I think that is what marked him.
Rem. His heart was perfect before the Lord. He did what was "good and right".
C.A.C. Yes, his heart "was perfect all his days".
Ques. Is there not a link between what he does in seeking Jehovah and his commanding Judah to seek the Lord God of their fathers, and to do the law and commandment? @Psalm 119 says, "Blessed are the perfect in the way, who walk in the law of Jehovah".
C.A.C. Yes, and particularly in relation to the service of God. It is religious things he deals with which directly challenge the order of the house set up, which required that everything inconsistent with it should be judged.
Rem. There is nothing mentioned as to the priestly service here.
{339}
C.A.C. No, it is not quite that side of things; it is faithfulness in a time of departure.
Rem. In the next chapter it says they had been without a teaching priest for a long time. I wondered how that applied today.
C.A.C. Yes; as the truth of the house of God and His service has come out, it has led to faithful action on the part of those whose hearts were rightly affected. Repeatedly we find these idolatrous elements dealt with for they were always there. Such things as are contrary to the character of God's house are to be dealt with. The enemy came up in this chapter because there was faithfulness. The Ethiopian comes up with his darkening forces. Then God takes the matter up. It is not at all a bad thing having that sort of attack; I wish we had more of that.
Rem. This section seems to follow the inside portion of the previous chapter. What follows is that the outside position is right.
C.A.C. Yes. Though it is a time of quietness, Asa also builds fortified cities. We might apply it today; when God gives us a time of peace and quietness, we ought to keep in mind that it is to strengthen us in view of future conflict. "The assemblies then ... had peace, being edified", it says (@Acts 9: 31); but when they have no particular conflict on hand, it is a special call to edification.
Ques. Is God not giving encouragement in assemblies locally, in that way, building them up?
C.A.C. Yes, that is the teaching of it.
Ques. Asa took away the altars and strange gods; is that not the character of it? @Hebrews 13: 10 refers to the altar -- it is *one* altar.
C.A.C. Every increase of light calls for a deepened exercise that we should not be inconsistent. We sang
{340}
hymns fifty years ago that were inconsistent with the true character of the service; all such things should be eliminated. As light comes, the range of things not consistent with it is extended.
Rem. I remember a brother saying that with every fresh ray of light from God we are to readjust our position.
C.A.C. Yes; when we are wholly on these lines the attack of the enemy becomes very confirming and strengthening. I suppose God allows things to be attacked so that we may be confirmed in the light of them. I doubt whether any of us are confirmed in the truth until we are opposed for it. A brother who was challenged spent all night considering the point in question and he was very much more established when the sun rose than if he had gone to bed. Every attack is establishing and clarifies the truth. It consolidates and confirms the saints and they have a much firmer hold than they had before. It is remarkable how lightly we hold these things, not very firmly in our minds even. It is an opposition of darkness, the Ethiopian, the natural darkness of the human mind against the light and faithfulness to the Lord. Sometimes it rises up in our own flesh; but then it is all confirmatory in the end.
Ques. Is that why you have the contested position in the end of Ephesians? There you have to hold the position.
C.A.C. So that here Asa is given absolute victory, because it is a clear-cut issue. It is man against God but Asa's reliance is fully on God. There is not an enemy left, only the spoil; and the result of that is seen in the next chapter.
Rem. Asa cried to Jehovah and said, "It maketh no difference to thee to help, whether there be much or no power" (verse 11).
{341}
C.A.C. It makes no difference whether there are many or few; what power there is with us is a most immaterial thing.
Rem. Whether there are weak conditions in a place makes no difference.
C.A.C. Yes, and God can make it clear to the feeblest saint what is the difference between light and darkness. In every conflict the question is between light and darkness; and when the opposition is seen to be darkness, it is utterly destroyed morally. When it is discerned, it is destroyed morally. There was not a man left. There was light with Asa and those with him; they were strengthening and building up what was of God. If the issue is between God and man, there is no question as to how it will turn out. You find saints sometimes attacked by very learned and religious men (poor ignorant saints), and relying on God they can completely baffle these learned men. Consciousness of weakness leads us to more complete reliance upon God, being identified with His truth, and using every opposition to become strengthened in the truth.
Rem. In verse 8 there were those who bore targets and spears and some that drew the bow. Some came into very close contact.
C.A.C. Oh, this opposition is always going on, and always having the same effect, for it exposes what is darkness and confirms the saints in the truth, and leads to there being spoil for God.
Ques. What is the thought of spoil, is it for God?
C.A.C. It says in chapter 15: 11 that they sacrificed of the spoil seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep. There are apprehensions of Christ which enrich the service of God. We all know, I hope, what it is to be attacked because of the truth, if we do not know what it is to be attacked by the natural darkness of the
{342}
human heart. But when there is reliance on God those attacking can be overthrown and fresh apprehensions of Christ gained, so that there is something for the pleasure of God. Then the prophetic word comes in at the beginning of the next chapter to confirm Asa. When any opposition is met in reliance on God, the prophetic word would always confirm the exercises of the faithful heart. There are certain fixed principles which come in. He says, "Jehovah is with you while ye are with him; and if ye seek him he will be found of you, but if ye forsake him he will forsake you". These are great fixed principles like 2 Timothy. I used to pray a good deal that the Lord would be with me in this and that and the other: I do not attach so much importance to that now.
Ques. What is more important?
C.A.C. That I should be with *Him*! He says, "Jehovah is with you while ye are with Him" (chapter 15: 2).
Rem. It says too, "If ye seek him he will be found of *you*".
C.A.C. They had been quite away from Him for a long time, as we see in verses 3 and 4.
Ques. Why should that be introduced in verse 3? Is it to bring them on to the true ground of repentance?
C.A.C. It is that we might see that it is a time of recovery. It is always a time of recovery. It is to remind us that He has moved in hearts to bring about recovery to Himself.
Ques. Is that the usual service of a priest, in teaching?
C.A.C. Yes, a "teaching priest" is a very choice gift; it is included in the priestly service. A "teaching priest" would teach with the thought of what was due to God; that would govern his ministry.
We see in verse 7 that this prophetic word comes in to encourage Asa. They had moved in such a way that the prophetic word does not find any fault with them; it is all
{343}
on the line of encouragement. We shall find, if we move in any small measure on the line of faithfulness and seek what is of God, the prophetic word always takes on an encouraging character. When we get away it will take on a rebuking character, so that later on Asa had to be told that he had done foolishly.
Ques. Would the encouragement to Philadelphia and the rebuke to Laodicea show that?
C.A.C. Yes, I think that shows it distinctly. He has no word of rebuke to Philadelphia, but strong rebuke to Laodicea.
The effect of a prophetic word like this leads to the making of a covenant with Jehovah. In verse 12, "They entered into a covenant to seek Jehovah the God of their fathers, with all their heart, and with all their soul". God looks that there should be definite committal to His service and seeking Him; He looks for it with every one of us.
Ques. Can we make a covenant in this way now; does the principle of it refer to us?
C.A.C. I think the principle of it stands, that is a definite committal with purpose of heart to the Lord.
Rem. That would be very pleasing to Him.
C.A.C. Yes, He looks for a definite kind of movement.
Ques. Does Paul's reference to the house of Stephanas illustrate it? "They ... devoted themselves to the saints for service" (@1 Corinthians 16: 15).
Ques. Is it the principle of a vow?
C.A.C. Yes, they are not indefinite. We are not just drifting along in a half-hearted way, but definitely committed to the Lord for His service.
Ques. Is that not done every Lord's day morning?
C.A.C. Yes, in a way, if it is. With all those who are pleasurable to the Lord there has been at some time a
{344}
definite committal. I do not think that anyone is pleasurable to God without it. It is a definite act of self-devotion which God loves.
Ques. Why were those not entering into it to be put to death?
C.A.C. It shows the essential character of it that nothing else would do.
Ques. Grace would not go to that extent, would it?
Rem. "If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be Anathema Maranatha" (@1 Corinthians 16: 22).
C.A.C. Yes, that is like it; you cannot assent quietly to any compromise, can you?
Rem. It virtually means it is the only thing to live for.
C.A.C. Yes, any christian would admit that the claims of God and the Lord Jesus in love are of such a character that whole-hearted devotion would be the only answer to it. It is an abstract truth to him, even if he did not carry it out practically.
Rem. It says they rejoiced at the oath, and that they swore to Jehovah with shouting and with trumpets. It says "with a loud voice" (verse 14), so they were not half hearted about it.
C.A.C. Yes, as we sang on Monday evening,
<blockquote>'Rise, my soul, thy God directs thee, <br>Stranger hands no more impede'. (`76:1)</blockquote>
What a blessed thing to have shaken off every influence that would hinder your being dedicated to such a God and such a Lord. In the sacrifices you see there are apprehensions of Christ that become available for the service of God. This was a very bright moment.
Rem. Asa "renewed the altar of Jehovah, that was before the porch of Jehovah" (verse 8). Is that the brazen altar?
C.A.C. Yes, I suppose so, showing it needed renewing.
{345}
It all stresses the point that it is a day of recovery.
Rem. How much there is to be done. The more light there is the more there is to be done.
C.A.C. It is beautiful to see that Asa maintained such devotedness and faithfulness for a long period of years -- thirty-five years. It is only the more sorrowful to think he went entirely astray at the end. It is put into Scripture as a warning to those who grow old in the faith and have had perhaps a pretty good record; they may finish badly. It is most important to maintain whatever we have been in the past, the measure of faith and devotedness. It is most important to retain our reliance on God. If moved from it, we may end very badly. Asa went astray, I suppose, by self coming in. When Baasha came up and built Ramah, it was that none might go out or come in to Asa. He felt it a restriction and limitation, and it annoyed him. When we get an idea that self is being touched, it undermines everything. Paul could say in prison "My God", Asa did not. Paul is maintained in his full reliance upon God, but Asa allowed consideration for himself to take him away from reliance upon God, so that after thirty-five years of devotion he ended very sadly. He had lost the practical value of his beautiful secret of reliance upon God.
Rem. From @Jeremiah 41: 9, Asa seemed to fear the man Baasha.
C.A.C. Something touched self, and he did not look upon it at all as touching God. It touched him, and to the quick. He does not think of Jehovah, but of some human expediency, and lost something that had been his joy for thirty-five years. The devil turns him in on himself and he lost reliance on God.
Ques. Was it for his blessing?
C.A.C. I think there was a secret behind it all. I once asked Mr Stoney how he could account for a certain
{346}
valued brother going astray and he replied, 'I cannot account for it, but if I knew all about him I could'. With Asa there was a cherishing of self and self-importance, and when exposed it touched a weak point.

NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 18
@2 Chronicles 18: 1 - 34
Ques. Is there not a drop down in this chapter in relation to this alliance with Ahab?
C.A.C. Jehoshaphat evidently did not purge himself from vessels to dishonour.
Ques. Would this chapter have just as much important teaching for us in remnant days as the previous chapter, I mean as a warning?
C.A.C. I think it is just as important. It shows, I think, that we may go a long way in a right direction without really being in a state of heart that is pleasing to God. I have no doubt there are many like Jehoshaphat marked by personal piety and a measure of zeal in carrying on the work of the Lord, who do not preserve purity in their associations.
Ques. Do you think this movement of Jehoshaphat with Ahab is traceable to a link formed in the past?
C.A.C. Well, evidently, because it was years before he allowed his son to marry Ahab's daughter, showing he had not been careful to maintain divine principles. It has always been a divine principle that a vessel to honour must purge himself from vessels to dishonour and be in separation. He allied himself first on social grounds by marriage and then he allied himself with Ahab's project of going up to Ramoth-Gilead, and did not keep himself in holy separation; by force of circumstances he was carried much beyond what he intended to do, and in which he was far from comfortable. It is the position of thousands of saints today.
{348}
Rem. In 2 Timothy we get "entanglement"; he was entangled.
C.A.C. Yes, he formed a link, and having formed it, he had not power or moral courage to shake himself free from it, and that is often the case. People form links with those far below them spiritually and drift into a position where they are very unhappy but cannot get out of it. It is known very well that Ahab was the most wicked king that ever reigned in Israel; he was worse than all that preceded him, and he had come definitely under God's judgment at this time for the murder of Naboth; and yet Jehoshaphat is quite ready to be on friendly terms with him and yet unhappy all the time. How many there are who recognise the evils of modernism and ritualism going on in christendom, and yet they go on with it, though they detest and abhor it in their inmost heart.
Rem. Jehoshaphat could never have appreciated the rift God had brought in.
C.A.C. Like many of us, his good nature, as it is called, overlooked all these things; no doubt he saw the position. We are all in danger of this; our desire to please people may lead us to sacrifice what is due to the Lord, and the more we go on on that line the more difficult it is to get out of it. He could not get out of it -- only by witnessing the death of his friend.
Rem. Yet God would keep His hand over him as we see in verse 31.
C.A.C. It is a comfort that all the saints prove God's help in spite of their wrong-doing, when they turn to Him. "Jehoshaphat cried out, and Jehovah helped him". God's wrath was over Jehoshaphat and yet He helped him.
Rem. His army was useless.
C.A.C. That is the way God had stripped him; he lost his men, and there was nothing but God for him. And
{349}
many saints have to be so stripped and brought down, so that there is nothing for them but to cry to God. He is not comfortable at the first because he feels there should be some reference to God; it is his piety struggling against his good nature; we often see it going on. The associations of many are not adjusted by the light of what they know; and they detest what they are all the while linked with.
Rem. "Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity" (@2 Timothy 2: 19).
C.A.C. That just touches the spot. Good nature is the most deadly enemy that the people of God have to contend with.
Rem. I am sure that is true.
C.A.C. I believe there are thousands of saints that would be in the testimony of the Lord, but for their good nature. I am positive of it. There is no spirituality in good human nature.
Rem. We take people by the hand and seek to persuade them.
C.A.C. If you take people by the hand, that would be to take them in the way you are going; that would be all right. Jehoshaphat had no confidence in these four hundred men. He has no confidence in any prophets Ahab would have about him; he wanted another. One prophet is enough; you do not want four hundred.
Rem. Elijah is not mentioned.
C.A.C. Elijah was for Israel. God was still working in Israel as He is in the christian profession today. Ahab was a worshipper of Baal, and married another. God has not altogether given up the christian profession, in spite of all its wickedness.
Rem. "I am as thou, and my people as thy people", Jehoshaphat said.
C.A.C. And that is how it works if we do not separate
{350}
from vessels to dishonour. We must at all costs separate from what is dishonouring to the Lord.
Rem. In chapter 21:12 Elijah the prophet is mentioned.
C.A.C. Elijah had gone to heaven and he had left a letter to be delivered on a certain date; he had been in heaven some time. God makes provision for every exigency. We have to learn today to distinguish between the prophets, four hundred against one, or one against four hundred. His good nature seems to be a constitutional defect with Jehoshaphat; but I believe he did in the end shake free. Kings tells us he overcame his constitutional defect; he was invited to join a certain enterprise and he would not. Some have more naturally kindly feelings than others and find it more difficult to shake themselves free.
Ques. It is noticeable that nearly all these kings failed at the end. How are we to be preserved?
C.A.C. All these examples are given to warn us. If there is any weakness in me that I have had the opportunity of mending for forty or fifty years and have not judged, it will come out in my old age, more pronounced. God orders it shall. It is a great warning to us, especially to those of us who are no longer young. There is a remarkable inside view afforded to us in this chapter into God's secret arrangements.
Ques. What is it?
C.A.C. The prophet was able to let out the secret of what was going on behind the scenes and it was such a remarkable disclosure that it should have made Jehoshaphat say at once, 'Not another step on this road will I go'. It is remarkable that the Spirit of God should suggest to us the deliberation going on in the presence of God of what was to be brought about, that is, the execution of the judgment on Ahab. It is a question here of how the
{351}
judgment passed was to be carried out. It was carried out by a spirit that proposed to be a lying spirit in the mouth of his prophets. The remarkable thing is that he is told about it.
Ques. Would it be like the strong delusion that God sends in the last days that they should believe a lie?
C.A.C. It corresponds with that; there is a lying spirit in the mouth of his prophets, so that an apostate is destroyed. It is most remarkable that God's prophet told them; it was not kept secret, but they were told what was going on. But in spite of it, Jehoshaphat and Ahab went on, they pursued their project.
Rem. Jehoshaphat is mistaken for Ahab in verse 31.
C.A.C. Jehoshaphat had evidently lost his military power by his unholy alliance with Ahab. I think that in the days that are past there have been men who have earnestly sought to establish the truth as far as they knew it. The early reformers and dissenters were pious and faithful men, but they lost all they had gained by their admission of worldly associations. In the last century there was a good deal of building of fortresses and military defences, but there was failure through not adopting unflinching separation from evil, so that one thing after another came in and the power was gone.
Ques. Why did Micah say as the other prophets did?
C.A.C. I think the tone of his voice indicated what he meant in a sort of sarcastic way, but Ahab discerned he did not really mean it.
Ques. Do you think that the judgment of this character of good nature would bring in spirituality?
C.A.C. There may be a great deal commendable about saints that still keep up their connection with vessels to dishonour.
Ques. Would this be like Lot? What is the difference?
C.A.C. It seems to me it was more a love of the
{352}
world. When we feel uncomfortable among things, there is no security except by breaking the link; it is the only thing to save us. Ahab was not very comfortable either; he disguised himself, he did his best to avert the impending calamity. We do not find Jehoshaphat was killed. Jehovah delivered him from this unholy link with Ahab, by Ahab's death, but He pronounced the solemn sentence upon him -- the prophet met him in the next chapter and challenged him -- "Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate Jehovah? Therefore is wrath upon thee from Jehovah".
Rem. Micah had to suffer; he was the second prophet to be put in prison (verse 26).
C.A.C. What we find at the very end is that God calls His people to come out of Babylon (@Revelation 18: 4). "And I heard another voice out of the heaven saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye have not fellowship in her sins, and that ye do not receive of her plagues: for her sins have been heaped on one another up to the heaven, and God has remembered her unrighteousnesses", showing that there are God's people mixed up with the great idolatrous system of Babylon, and they are called to come out of her.
Rem. It is remarkable that this is the last call God makes.
C.A.C. So God is calling His people today out of all these unholy associations.
Rem. "All indeed who desire to live piously in Christ Jesus will be persecuted" (@2 Timothy 3: 12).
C.A.C. Quite so. Jehoshaphat escaped the reproach that Micah had. Micah came into reproach under the presence of Ahab; Jehoshaphat came under reproach under the presence of God, which is very much worse. I have no doubt all this is given for instruction to the saints of the assembly; it brings out just those features that are
{353}
to be avoided on the one hand, and those that are to be cultivated on the other. All that is written is instruction for the assembly.
{354}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 23
@2 Chronicles 23: 12 - 21
Ques. When God's anointed appears it brings out opposition, would you say?
C.A.C. Yes, and the enemy is also exposed. That is one side of the matter, but the saints coming together to eat the Lord's supper and to extol and exalt Him is really God's exposure of the whole corrupt state of things that marks the christian profession. It may seem a very small thing for a few insignificant persons to come together as commemorating the Lord's supper, and to praise Him, but it is God's rebuke to the whole corrupt system of christendom. We have been learning in this chapter that God has His own way of securing a place for His beloved Son, of securing what is due to Him. We say sometimes, 'All the rights to Him belong', and God has His own way of securing His praise, and that is subject to hostility.
Ques. Your reference to the Lord's supper would be the public position?
C.A.C. Yes.
Rem. So that it needs courage as well as affection.
C.A.C. Yes, every man has his weapon on, which reminds us that the scene around is hostile, and there is that in ourselves we have to use it against. It is an exercise to ourselves that we should not come to the Supper in a formal way, that we should not fall into current christianity. The Lord expects us to come on a very different footing from that. It is a public announcement which shows the public character of it. We find it is the
{355}
noise of the people running and praising the king that should be heard, saints breaking forth in praise to the Lord because they cannot help it; for that is the character of the service when we have eaten the Supper. It leaves us with a blank, and there is nothing but Christ to fill it. How could anyone of us do anything else but break forth in praise? It would be nice if we had the reputation here that we come together to eat the Lord's supper, and that we praise the Lord in a way that He is not praised anywhere else, that is, praise going up from loyal hearts that honour Christ in a way He is honoured nowhere else. That calls forth the cry of "Conspiracy". It is really a most treasonable thing in the sight of the religious world that people actually praise Him without religious accessories and from full hearts. In verse 18 they sing intelligently; you find that intelligent praises are addressed to the Lord and to the Father; first to the Lord.
Rem. The word really means 'a symphony'.
C.A.C. That really marks the praises of the assembly, so that something is wrong if every heart does not vibrate in symphony. Thank God, generally it does. When God is praised and exalted and what He has done is told out in praise, surely every heart must respond. The world cares nothing for Christ being praised, and is exposed in its hollowness and emptiness. So Athaliah cries, "Conspiracy". It has opened the way for the devil to bring in all this formalism and officialism, but it displaces Christ.
Ques. Last week we were speaking about the crowning; also Jehoiada and his sons anointed Joash, and then later on he is enthroned. How is that answered to by the saints?
C.A.C. Well, those are beautiful features of the way the saints love to honour Christ as the women anointed
{356}
Him in the gospels. They perceive that He is God's Anointed, and so He must be my Anointed too.
Ques. What would be the thought that they gave him the testimony (verse 11)?
C.A.C. That is a very interesting question. It seems to suggest that it is according him this wonderful place, that all God's testimony is in his hand; not only that it is so, but the saints accord him that place.
Rem. F.E.R. said that God always gives testimony to what He is going to bring in in a coming day.
C.A.C. I think that is true, and the saints recognise it is all committed to Christ; the full testimony of what is in God's mind and heart is committed to Christ. "The Father ... has given all things to be in his hand" (@John 3: 35). And the saints say, 'We are in accord with that' -- how we love to accord it to Him! It is not simply that God gives it to Him, but the saints give it to Him. It is the same with the crowning and so on, it is our delight. It all begins in secret as we saw in the end of chapter 22 by divine teaching in secret. The secret appreciation of Christ is developed and then there is the public assembling together and the Supper, because of His worthiness.
Ques. Does it bring out the trustworthiness of the saints, because we gather, not quite in the sense of failure, but in the sense more of loyalty?
C.A.C. Do you think that in Jehoiada being prominent in all this, it is by the priestly leading and support of the Lord that we come into all this in a practical way? Each Lord's day should be a coronation day for Christ. The saints are going to own Him afresh. We cannot eat His supper or praise Him without His support. If we have not His support it is almost a certainty that things would become gradually formal.
Ques. In the Song of Songs the spirit of the assembly
{357}
would be like this?
C.A.C. From that point of view everything opposed to the honour of Christ is exposed. Athaliah is exposed, she is judged, she is killed. Everything contrary to Christ is condemned in our estimation.
Rem. Verse 13 would suggest order in the saints; all the movements are in order.
C.A.C. I think that is very suggestive in this chapter, for you see the order right through, from the moment that he is secretly cherished to everything being in order as regards the position.
Ques. Is there any suggestion that "such as taught to sing praise" (verse 13) could give a lead in praises?
C.A.C. Yes, there is the blowing with trumpets and the singers with instruments of music and such as taught to sing praises. See how the Lord has been helping in the last hundred years. I believe I have the first hymn book that was compiled among brethren. If we compared it we should have to confess that the Lord has been teaching the saints, that is, by ministry (the trumpets) and the Spirit has been moving in the affections of the saints to praise Him in the way He is wishing to be praised in hymns expressive of the truth. The next time the hymn book is revised it will be greatly improved. It shows that the singing must depend on the ministry; we cannot go beyond. We ought to be exercised that the praise is up to the ministry; we must praise in accord with that.
Athaliah is killed; all she represents should be absolutely slain amongst those honouring the Lord. "Her children will I kill with death; and all the assemblies shall know that I am he that searches the reins and the hearts" (@Revelation 2: 23) is said of Jezebel. This is one of Jezebel's children. The Lord is not going to have anything of that sort in His assembly. It is just in this connection we see the wonderful favour of God to us, because Jezebel and
{358}
Athaliah have turned the Lord's supper into an idolatrous institution in christendom.
Ques. In regard to your reference to the singing and the hymn book, I was wondering whether there should not be an exercise as to whether means should not be made available in the way of new and suitable hymns?
C.A.C. I think it is spiritually natural to us to consider how the Lord should be praised, and how God should be praised. Now what part can I contribute vitally to the praises of the assembly? If I cannot contribute anything, I might just as well be a block of wood; I might just as well be the seat I am sitting on; that is, it is dead for God. The effect of God being praised out of glad hearts is that there is a movement Godward, so that a covenant is made on behalf of Jehoiada and all the people and the king, that they should be the people of Jehovah. They begin to rejoice in being in relation with God. It is a further point that they should be the people of Jehovah, and that is how the service moves on to that which is in relation to God, like the hymn we sang at the beginning of our meeting there is the taking up of covenant relations with God. It is a very suitable hymn for our meeting.
Rem. In @Hebrews 9: 19 - 22, I thought the reference to the sprinkling of blood there was definitely for the people; a people is secured for the service of God by the covenant. Then the vessels of service and the tabernacle are sprinkled.
C.A.C. Yes, I think so. It is very interesting to see how these things follow one upon the other. If Christ gets His place in our praises and joy, it leads on to that in which God is praised.
Ques. Why is it "the people and the king" in verse 16?
C.A.C. The king is really Jehovah's king, so that in
{359}
rising up to the thought of their being the people of Jehovah, there is reached a further thought in the service. I think that is just the point, not only is Christ the pre-eminent One in our praises -- that comes first -- but we move on to the fuller thought that we are in association with Him in the presence of God.
It is evidently true that if we happen to be the people of God no element of idolatry must be left unjudged. The house of Baal represents the whole idolatrous system that is round about us today. So christendom proclaims that anyone baptised is a child of God and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven. It is the blackest lie that was ever found on the earth, it is simply idolatry. The christian ordinance is turned into idolatry; see how people worship a piece of bread. It all belongs to the house of Baal and it is all to be broken down in our hearts and minds through giving God His place. Everything that comes between the soul and God is judged and set aside, and then the service can go on.
Ques. Does that spring out of known relationship with God -- our link with God?
C.A.C. Yes, quite so. It is the only way to get rid of idolatry, to have the heart filled with God. We sing,
<blockquote>'And, filled with Thee, the constant mind <br>Eternally is blest'. (`178:3)</blockquote>
If the mind is filled with God, there is no room for anything but God. The offices of the house of Jehovah are appointed under the hand of the priest, and the order as written in the law of Moses represents that beautiful order set up under the hand of the Lord. So you see religious service generally goes on whatever the state of the worshippers may be. We are in one sense therefore at a disadvantage, if you can say so, because the service depends on the spiritual state and history of every
{360}
person in the assembly; we cannot make it go on apart from the spiritual history of the saints.
Rem. So that the introduction of a litany, an ordered service, had to be because of a corrupt state.
C.A.C. If there was nothing in the service but what was living, there would not be much in a great deal which is just of man; but all that counts is living. Then as the service is set in order, there is the necessity in the doorkeepers that nothing unclean should enter in. Moses represents the principle of commandment; certain things like the Lord's supper are not optional. In David we get the spiritual side of things which comes from Christ as Head, which is suggestive to us of spirituality. We all know what will take place up until the time in the meeting when the basket goes round, but we do not know afterwards, and all the refined part of the service is connected with the Lord's headship, and nothing is more precious than getting an impulse received from the Head. If we hold the Head we shall bring into the service the evidence to God that we are holding Him as Head, and getting impulse and instruction and direction from Him as Head. That is really the climax of the service, so if you got a perfect meeting how delightful it would be to know that what was going up to Him was the direct impulse flowing from Christ as Head.
Rem. Verse 18 says, "to offer up Jehovah's burnt-offerings".
C.A.C. Yes, the burnt-offering was the climax of the offerings and represented the highest point of the sacrificial service, and that has its place in the service, what Christ is to God and in glorifying God in sacrifice. But David inaugurated the service of praise. First we learn Christ in connection with Moses, then in connection with David.
Ques. One depends on the other?
{361}
C.A.C. Yes. In connection with Moses great intelligence as to the death of Christ has its place. He has unfolded to us in marvellous detail the preciousness and value and sweet savour of the death of Christ. There is no book like Leviticus in the whole of Scripture for such detail of the death of Christ. That must be the unaltered basis of all the service; but then we do not stop there. The more we realise the character of the service of the assembly, the more jealous we should be of doorkeeping; the more jealous we should be that nothing unclean should come in. The porters are in charge of the house; it is a constant service and we must watch in ourselves that nothing unsuitable comes in. I am entirely out of my orbit if I do anything unsuitable during the week that disqualifies me. Then there is care for others; one great part is that anything unsuitable to God shall be dealt with, whatever it is.
Rem. We are told that doorkeepers were the same number as the singers.
C.A.C. Yes, and we ought to realise we are in a place of care. It was said by J.B.S. that anyone who came into fellowship should feel under more strict scrutiny than in a monastery or nunnery; that is right in principle.
{362}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 24
@2 Chronicles 24: 1 - 27
C.A.C. Chapter 23 is full of spiritual suggestions and seems to stand by itself in that connection. Jehoiada is the great leader in chapter 23, and represents that priestly condition which is the result of the Spirit of God having His place. In Jehoiada you get the thought of the spiritual lead given, and the result of it is that Christ gets His place and everything that is proper to the service of God flows out of that. It is a most comprehensive chapter and worthy of much consideration. In this chapter we must still keep Jehoiada very much in view; he is, as we might say, the leading figure. The great lesson of the chapter is the importance of being kept under the influence and control of the Spirit of God, the blessed results of being so kept, and the dreadful results of departing from that control. So that we should pay great attention to the spiritual leading that always comes to us through spiritual persons. There is no such thing as the leading of the Spirit except through persons.
Ques. Are you referring to Corinthians?
C.A.C. In @1 Corinthians 12 we read that "to each the manifestation of the Spirit is given for profit" (verse 7). The Spirit Himself is invisible, but then He is to come into manifestation, and that can only be through the saints, the members of the body. Without them there would be no manifestation of the Spirit, and I think Jehoiada represents this element which can only be found in the assembly. That is the real value of the saints coming together as under the influence of the Spirit and we find
{363}
it amongst the brethren. We flee from the world and ourselves with our complex exercises, and the result is that as we flee from that we shall do what is right and shall prosper.
Ques. What does it mean when it says, "The Spirit speaks expressly" (@1 Timothy 4: 1)?
C.A.C. It is the utterance of the Spirit through some vessel.
Ques. What have you in mind in your thought of leading only coming through vessels? He comes upon vessels and moves vessels, does He not?
C.A.C. I am seeking to get the instruction from this chapter for myself. I think Jehoiada represents an influence under which Joash was kept right for a long time; then he was removed, and that was disastrous.
Rem. It speaks in Romans of those who are led by the Spirit of God (@Romans 8: 14).
C.A.C. I am using the word 'led' more in the sense of influence. When Joash left the influence of Jehoiada, he collapsed entirely and came down so low that it leaves a serious question in the mind as to whether he was a saint at all. The broad teaching of the chapter is that Jehoiada represents the principle of control. It pleased God that Joash should be tested when left to himself. We may be at all the meetings and read the ministry yet not be in the power of things ourselves. But we would not belittle what is done under spiritual influence, even if not in the power of it ourselves. It is not altogether valueless for there is benefit though persons may not be in the full power of it themselves.
Rem. It would preserve saints to keep as near spiritual persons as they can.
C.A.C. Yes. In christendom there is very little scope given to this, but God has wrought these last hundred years to cause His people to desire the manifestation of
{364}
the Spirit, and they benefit greatly and God benefits. Joash benefited though he was not in it himself, and Jehoiada's house benefited. We have all benefited by spiritual ministry in some way, and come under it. Demas was a companion of Paul and a partaker of the Holy Spirit through Paul, but we have the same feeling about him as we have about Joash, we do not know whether we shall see him in heaven or not.
Rem. There was an isolated sister who was in the gain of things.
C.A.C. She did not undervalue the manifestations of the Spirit which there were locally or elsewhere. Paul gives a few examples of the manifestations of the Spirit in @1 Corinthians 12; he does not by any means cover the whole range. I think we sometimes undervalue the importance of being where the manifestations of the Spirit are. There is the possibility of our partaking of the Holy Spirit as acting in others.
Ques. Why is there failure after the death of Jehoiada?
C.A.C. Certainly the Spirit will not fail us. Jehoiada died, and so perhaps could be said to have failed Joash.
Ques. What is the living link between the persons and the manifestations in the body?
C.A.C. I think it is found in this chapter; it is what lies in every one being a contributor. It is illustrated by the fact that when it came into the mind of Joash to repair the house, the principle of general contribution was at once established and nothing will keep the body in healthy action but general contribution, as it is in the human body. The house has been devastated and the vessels given over to the house of Baal, and we are in that condition of things today. Now the thing is to renew and repair what has fallen into decay. Well, all hands must come to the front. We are living in that time now; it is
{365}
almost like beginning over again, and everyone is to be a contributor. The chest is brought there for that purpose, it is for everyone. Joash refers to the original principle in the tribute of Moses in verses 6 and 9. I suppose he is referring to the heave-offering for the construction of the tabernacle and he goes back to the original thought that all the offerings came out of the hearts of the people. You see that God is concerned that every brother and sister should come into the matter. I should suppose he refers to the heave-offering as called for after the great sin of the people, not @Exodus 25 but chapter 35 when the people had made the golden calf, and had been spared on the ground of the intercession of Moses. So God had put a special sense of mercy into their hearts, and now they were to contribute in the sense of that. It was to come from a people who owed everything to mercy. And here nothing but mercy would do in this condition; the house had been laid low and the vessels taken, and everyone is to have a hand in the reconstruction. If a sister says 'amen' in her heart in a prayer meeting that goes into the chest. It is not a question of money, though that may enter into it, but of contributing something that might be for the renewing and restoring of the house. The servants who minister to us would be much helped if we prayed for them. Paul wrote "ye also labouring together by supplication for us that the gift towards us, through means of many persons, may be the subject of the thanksgiving of many for us" (@2 Corinthians 1: 11). The gift bestowed upon him was, he says, the result of their prayers. Thousands of people benefit by it, and as prayer goes up in thanksgiving to God the house is benefited.
Rem. "Joash did what was right in the sight of Jehovah all the days of Jehoiada the priest".
C.A.C. Yes, and God sees to it that as in the body we
{366}
are furnished with the elements of spiritual influence and control, and we should be prepared to be more with them, and as long as we are we shall do what is right. As soon as Jehoiada passed off the scene Joash falls under the influence of an entirely opposite character, and we see that often; people further the influence at one time and then become antagonistic.
The house and its service should be much before us. There is a great deal of collecting money for various purposes, but where do you hear of people collecting money that the house of God should be furthered? That is, contributing to what is spiritual in which we can all have part. If it is only saying 'amen' to a prayer that is a contribution.
Ques. How are we to understand the manifestation of the Spirit?
C.A.C. It is the Spirit objectively rather than subjectively, if that is understood.
Rem. Yes, so I support the manifestation of the Spirit, and if I contribute I get the benefit.
C.A.C. That is the idea. And we read here that the house is brought to completion. "So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them" (verse 13). And the house is furnished with suitable vessels, so that all is according to the mind of God, and that at a very dark period and just as dark a time as it is now. God would have us contribute so that this should take place and the house be completed.
Ques. How does verse 17 apply to us?
C.A.C. It shows that some of those prominent in the assembly have been used by Satan to influence the saints. It is most important that when the saints are together we should look for the manifestation of the Spirit in all the contributions.
Ques. Would there be something in the nature of
{367}
burnt-offering in such contributions?
C.A.C. Yes, and a character of offering that you would not find anywhere else. One who left us for a position in the religious world has remarked since, 'There is no worship anywhere else'. What a solemn thing to say; it is signing his own condemnation. I think everyone who has the Spirit is capable of judging what is of the Spirit and what is of the natural man; it is characteristic of the believer who has the unction, and he knows. We see the sad result of Jehoiada's death is that not only does idolatry come in, but the prophetic word has no power. So Jehoiada's son is killed in the very courts of the house, and that at the command of Joash!
Rem. He is the last prophet mentioned by the Lord in @Matthew 23: 35.
C.A.C. Showing where we may get to if we do not keep under the control of the Spirit. I have to see to it that I recognise all that is of the Spirit in all the brethren. If we get away from that state, there is no telling where we might get to, perhaps to a point where we refuse with hatred a prophetic word direct from God. So Joash has a very sad end. It is a warning of the need to keep under spiritual control: I feel it is a warning to me.
Rem. And it is what is universal.
C.A.C. That is most important, no one individual and not half the assembly is sufficient; it takes every member of the anointed vessel. We have all the ministry in all parts of the world dropped to us for a few coppers.
Rem. One member might hinder the whole body if not functioning.
C.A.C. Yes, nothing will keep me from coming under the wrong influence but keeping under the influence of the Spirit. In these last days God has revived the desire to be under the influence of the Spirit. Meetings for prophetic ministry have come in to help, and a word is
{368}
often given on such an occasion to meet a necessary state locally.
{369}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 25
@2 Chronicles 25: 1 - 28
Ques. Does the presence of prophets and men of God after the death of Jehoiada suggest there will always be an element that will stand for the testimony in spite of apostasy?
C.A.C. Yes, the exceeding grace of God comes out in that; even when spiritual conditions are not present. God reserves the right to speak through prophets, though in a state of departure the prophets are not listened to.
Rem. This is another example of the danger of having things right outwardly but weak inwardly. Amaziah had a very good start apparently.
C.A.C. You are referring to what it says in verse 2: "He did what was right in the sight of Jehovah, yet not with a perfect heart". I suppose the Lord so orders things that if the heart is not right the state is exposed. It reminds one of Ephesus; they did much that was right, but they had left their first love. "But I have against thee, that thou hast left thy first love" (@Revelation 2: 4).
Rem. Outward conditions being in order is not enough.
C.A.C. I think we saw that last week. Joash should have been anxious to take on the features seen in Jehoiada, and to possess them himself. We are preserved by going on with spiritual persons, but then we should be concerned to take on the features we have observed in them.
Rem. The outward should be the reflection of the inward.
{370}
C.A.C. Amaziah's first failure seems to have been in bringing these "hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel". It was really a leaning on the arm of the flesh, and nothing and nobody can be of any help to us if the Lord is not with them, they are only weakness.
Ques. What is in the suggestion, "Jehovah is not with Israel" (verse 7)? Do they represent an apostate condition?
C.A.C. Yes, they had gone away from Jehovah and gone into idolatry; so there was a lack of spiritual sensitiveness with Amaziah to think that they could be any help to him.
Rem. There is a commercial basis with it.
Ques. Does that not come in when we are weak; we see it in christendom?
Ques. There is one here standing for God and he is called "the man of God" (verse 9); is that why?
C.A.C. I think it has been said that the title is only used when the general conditions are bad.
Rem. Like Timothy.
Rem. It seems as if affection will hold the saints.
C.A.C. And if that is not so, there will be a leaning on the flesh in some form. Happily, the king was ready to accept correction in this first instance. This passage discredits any partnership in, or co-operation with, those who are not in line with the testimony. Amaziah is on the downward grade, because he would not listen to the prophet in verse 16. It would seem even his action in connection with Edom was not a spiritual action; he took an extreme course in taking ten thousand alive and casting them down from the cliff so that they were all broken in pieces, for if the Lord is not with us we may be extreme in our actions. We are never told that Amaziah sought God so he never had God with him in anything that he did, and he came under the power of those he had apparently overcome. Instead of overcoming the
{371}
Edomites, the Edomites really overcame him for he adopted their idols.
Rem. Knowledge of the Scriptures does not give us the things.
C.A.C. No. Circumstances come along to expose where we really are. I think that is God's way with all of us. If our hearts are not perfect with the Lord, circumstances come along to expose us; God allows it to be so.
Rem. Amaziah was governed, as England too has been governed, by principles that are very largely of God, and I think God has recognised that.
C.A.C. I think so.
Rem. God gives Amaziah a chance of escape.
Rem. When there is a chance to have things livingly we should take advantage of it.
Rem. We will have grace and own it before God and get help.
C.A.C. He gets more and more presumptuous and self-willed as time goes on, so that he is a serious warning to us.
Rem. I suppose circumstances are a range of things always occurring in the individual path or in the path of the assembly. They are really tests as to whether we are going through them with God to an issue, or going to allow them to be an obstruction.
C.A.C. So in this case the end was disastrous to the testimony, the wall of Jerusalem was broken down and the vessels carried off. He became more and more self-willed, and if we are not with God that will be the inevitable result. If God is not with us we shall find we have no power to escape from the flesh, it becomes dominant.
Rem. But God was behind it all (verse 20).
Rem. The hardness of his flesh came out in the question of what Amaziah did with these captives. If in a bad
{372}
state of soul what marks us is hardness and harshness.
C.A.C. If I discover an element of hardness or harshness in my heart I always feel it is a warning that God is not with me.
Rem. Paul says to Timothy, "Be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus" (@2 Timothy 2: 1).
C.A.C. The apostle says to him, "The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you" (@2 Timothy 4: 22). It is the last word. That is a matter that is never to be missing, I feel, and would preserve us from hardness and harshness and the self-confidence that marked Amaziah. If it were so we should be preserved from extremes and from getting lifted up and entertaining thoughts that are beyond the measure of what God has allotted to us; we should be sober and sensitive to the word.
Rem. Because Amaziah had no feeling, he fell under the things that had no feeling. God takes him up on that ground and judges him for it.
C.A.C. Every part of the chapter has the character of warning, and not a constructive character. In these kings principles are allowed to be developed to instruct us. We have to consider them carefully, they are the word of God to us.
{373}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 28
@2 Chronicles 28: 1 - 27
C.A.C. Ahaz was a very favoured man, but does not seem to have profited by the favour shown him. He lived in a time of much precious ministry. I was thinking of Isaiah, Hosea and Micah; they were all serving just at this time, and all speaking of the ministry of divine grace and restoring power, something like the present time. Ahaz lived in one of the most favoured times there had ever been, and the prophet Isaiah had been sent expressly to him assuring him of divine favour and protection. It was a time when God was beginning to unfold in a remarkable way the blessing of His people, and particularly of a remnant, but Ahaz was not interested.
Ques. Would you say God was holding his son, Hezekiah, in reserve?
C.A.C. What the father missed the son gave. I think it is important God had presented to Ahaz the thought that "The remnant shall return" (@Isaiah 10: 21); and Ahaz had the opportunity of being part of the remnant that should return, but he was not interested and he missed it. But his son was very observant of God's ways with his father and his indifference to it all, and he profited and became really the remnant. This man Ahaz was the very man to whom God gave the light of 'Emmanuel', the virgin's son, most extraordinary light, and yet it was all lost upon him. It is a question whether our eyes are open to the light in our day or to whether we are indifferent. We need to have our spirits imbued with this attitude of the Lord who was moving in grace in spite of everything,
{374}
so that the prophetic ministry goes on even to Laodicea. God has not given up the christian profession, but goes on with it, appealing to it in grace. The mercy to the captives brought about by God in such a remarkable way ought to have touched and reached him that these two hundred thousand should be brought back, clothed, fed and anointed. It was just the attitude of God towards His people at the moment.
Ques. Should we look for this recovery around us?
C.A.C. It would be nice if we could give a little expression to that. You see in the mind of God the remnant is really bound up with Christ. @Isaiah 7 should be carefully read in this connection. Ahaz was indifferent when he had the privilege of asking a sign. "I will not ask, and will not tempt Jehovah", he says. And God says, 'If you will not ask, I will give you one Myself'. "Behold, the virgin shall conceive and shall bring forth a son, and call his name Immanuel" (@Isaiah 7: 14) -- God's great sign of restoration even for Israel. The proper effect of considering this chapter would be seen in Hezekiah for he grows up under the discipline that all this was to him. How dreadful for him to grow up with all this wickedness going on, how dreadful for the remnant, it must have broken their hearts. Jehovah sent His servant to Ahaz saying, 'Do not be afraid of these men; they will not hurt you'. It did not break his heart for he preferred to go his own way without God, so God had to leave him in the hands of these two kings for discipline.
Rem. It is remarkable it says "Jehovah his God" (verse 5).
C.A.C. The Lord has not given up christendom yet, and we ought to be in the spirit of this towards all christendom. He is going to spue Laodicea out of His mouth, but He has not done it yet. What there is in the Lord is available for Laodicea; no one could say they
{375}
were excluded. Ahaz was not excluded, he was included in the message for Israel. We need to be kept from this indifference. There should be enquiry as to whether there are any prophets. Had they enquired they would have been told. Yes! there is Isaiah, and Hosea, and Micah, and they are all speaking now; we had better pay attention to what they are saying. "Lift up a prayer for the remnant that is left", Hezekiah said (@Isaiah 37: 4); showing that there were some. It is very like today: it was not a complete desert, there was a rose in it. Every christian on the face of the earth ought to be interested in J. N. Darby's ministry. If they were seeking they would not be long in hearing there is a wonderful ministry of Christ and the assembly on the earth. When things are put in writing and print they become public property.
Rem. Some may not know of it.
C.A.C. I do not think that the Lord would leave any really interested heart out of the secret.
Rem. The truth draws to itself, it has been said, like a magnet.
C.A.C. The people refused the waters of Shiloah that flow softly, no doubt referring to the ministry of Isaiah. In the beautiful waters flowing softly God was speaking of Christ and all that He would bring in for His children -- His testimony. I think the Lord allows some kind of distress to come on His people universally which is intended to wake up their interest in Isaiah. It was God taking pains to show that His thought was recovery and restoration; so that we find a prophet even in Samaria, showing that Jehovah had not given up the ten tribes. There were Elijah and Elisha, showing that if God's people had given Him up, He had not given them up. In fact the prophetic word took more effect in Samaria than in Jerusalem. It seems to bring out the extraordinary favour on God's part to a people who certainly did not
{376}
deserve any favour at all.
Ques. Do you think in the favour of God He would preserve the thought of this prophet, maintaining thereby a living link with the people?
C.A.C. I think it always has been so through church history, though we do not know much about it. There has always been a maintenance of witness to God's thoughts. The question of food is raised by the prophet, of eating butter and honey, until the child should know how to refuse the evil and choose the good (@Isaiah 7: 16); that is, the richest food is available and it gives discerning power, so that we discern between what is evil and what is good. This was brought before Ahaz, he ought to have weighed it well. Am I feeding on the best food available? Honey suggests what is of a rich and nourishing character. Isaiah speaks of a man nourishing a young cow and two sheep, which would be very profitable, showing if we nourish what is of God, it will nourish us (@Isaiah 7: 21). Do we appreciate this food? He does not say he would know to refuse evil by knowing all about evil, but having the good he would refuse the evil.
Ques. Verse 9 would be God's restraining hand over His people?
C.A.C. Even if God brings severe chastisement over His people, He will not allow it to go to an excessive point. The blessed God feels for His people, even when suffering what they deserve, and He takes trouble to set up a testimony of grace. As in Job's case there is often a danger of things going beyond, and God's heart is touched for His people. So here He brings in His prophet. God is severely chastising the nations at the present time, and He is closely watching it, not to let it go beyond bounds, because His thought is not destruction but restoration; all has in view the return of a remnant. He is going to have a remnant, a "holy seed", even if the
{377}
stump is cut down (@Isaiah 6: 13), and I think it comes out typically in Isaiah and his household (@Isaiah 7: 3); I think it represents the remnant.
Rem. There was a book called 'The calling and grace of the remnant' by J.B.S. (Volume 2 pages 493 ff ).
C.A.C. Oh! it ought to be read by everybody once a year!
It is interesting that God was using this sorrowful discipline for the teaching of Hezekiah, so that he comes out as a product. All that is sorrowful coming before us is all part of our education, the failure of christians being the most sorrowful perhaps of all, but then it is all formative. These things are to be great before our hearts, and to be brought before others so that the power of attraction should work. These men entered into the spirit of the dispensation. It was not God's thought that His people should be bondmen and bondwomen; His thought was liberty, and that they should be sent back in a royal way, in a generous way: clothed, fed, anointed and the feeble of them carried on asses. It is a wonderful spectacle and brings out what was in God's mind for all the people, the prophetic word. It is interesting that they are sent first to the city of palm trees. It was certainly a great triumph of divine grace, these poor captives sent back in such a royal style to their brethren. It was a powerful testimony to Ahaz and to all Israel of what was in the mind of God, and so today there is a testimony that goes forth to all. It did Ahaz no good and he died, as we might say, in disgrace, the sad end of a man who was so indifferent to the extraordinary grace shown him by God. It is much like Laodicea which is neither cold nor hot but marked by indifference.
{378}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 29
@2 Chronicles 29: 9 - 30
Ques. Would you help us as to the covenant in verse 10?
C.A.C. Is it not that we come to the point of seeing that certain things are not only right and desirable, but that we must be definitely committed to them, which has a voice for us surely today?
Rem. It was in his heart and the right place.
C.A.C. Many believers are prepared to assent to truth that may be brought before them, without being prepared for definite committal to it in a practical way. I was thinking of the word "hallow" and "hallowed" (verses 5, 17), which seems to be a prominent word in this chapter; that is, an impression of holiness was upon the heart of Hezekiah, and it came on the hearts of others too. It is the most essential word for us to consider, for it seems to me that as the presence of the Spirit was lost sight of practically the thought of holiness essentially went.
Ques. Would you not say that in the exercise of approach to God and taking up His service the first thing to be recognised is holiness, and any touching these things must be marked by that themselves? "Filthiness" is a strong word but it is so in connection with the house of God.
C.A.C. And that is exterminated by the holiness that becomes the house. I think that Hezekiah had probably got an impression from the prophet Isaiah. A great impression made on the prophet's soul was holiness; the impression in @Isaiah 6 is "Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah of
{379}
hosts". It would almost seem as if he had passed on the thought to Hezekiah who would have the thought of the house being hallowed.
Rem. With the Levites (verse 11) the great objective would be ministering to Him.
Rem. There should be no toleration of looseness with us.
C.A.C. The main exercise among the people of God during the last century was holiness, revived by a great sense of the presence of the Spirit of God, because He is the Holy Spirit; and, of course, the presence here of the Spirit of God carries with it some thought of the house of God.
Ques. Would the house date from Pentecost, when the Spirit came down?
C.A.C. Yes, but then all true thought of the house of God was lost with the losing of the thought of the Spirit as a present divine Person. It lay at the root of all the departure. Well-intentioned men fell back on the outward order of bishops, deacons and other features, and the thought of God dwelling here Spirit-wise was lost. But then God has given it back; it is recovered, and along with it the thought that God has a dwelling here, and holiness is here; and we are all, I trust, definitely committed to it. So this chapter covers the exercises of the last century.
Ques. I wonder whether we are all clear as to what holiness is?
C.A.C. It has often been said that righteousness maintains the judgment of evil, but holiness maintains the inward abhorrence of it, and is not that right in principle?
Rem. The thought of holiness really hangs on the presence of the Holy Spirit.
C.A.C. And that involves the house, but the house
{380}
viewed as what has to be preserved through the exercises of the saints, so there is the hallowing of the house and the removal of filthiness and uncleanness, and in speaking of the house, what is not of God is unclean and filthiness. God dwelling here raises at once the question of what is suitable to God, otherwise we might choose to have things that are most according to our liking. If God is dwelling here and the saints are the house, the thought of holiness is intensified, and a thousand things people consider not harmful are filthy as measured by the Spirit of God. It is most essential that this thought of holiness should be preserved if this service is to go on in a way that is delightful to God. If anything intrudes into the service which is not of God, it is unclean. A vast number of things have come in in that way, and they have to be carried out and that has been going on the last hundred years, because God revived the thought of the Spirit, and it makes the body and the house a great reality for any soul realising it by faith. You could not possibly go on with a sect after that. It is an attempt to set up religiously the man who is entirely rejected by God.
Rem. It condemns what our fathers went on with (verse 6).
C.A.C. And it is recognised now that what is proper to the house has been destroyed; the doors shut, the lamps out and no offerings of sweet savour. There is no gospel, no spiritual ministry, and the result is there is no spiritual answer to God according to the dispensation. It is a dreadful state of things, but it is a fact in the religious world. God has revived the fact of the presence of the Spirit, and I believe any soul who has some sense of the Holy Spirit has some sense of the body and the house.
Ques. Why do you stress the body?
C.A.C. Simply because it is involved in the presence of the Spirit. "In the power of one Spirit we have all been
{381}
baptised into one body" (@1 Corinthians 12: 13). In giving any thought to the Spirit no one could think He dwells in him alone, for He dwells in all the saints -- that is the body, the worshipping company.
Rem. It is striking that it says twice in verse 24, "for all Israel".
C.A.C. Is that not very attractive? When he comes to the sin-offering and burnt-offering, he says, "all Israel". So we need to cultivate that sense of things. And does that not remind us that holiness is a matter of affection?
Rem. So the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given to us.
C.A.C. So the working out of holiness is by love. That it is by faith is a terrible delusion, it is by love. So whatever is inconsistent with holiness is inconsistent with love; it is two parts of the divine nature. So we speak of 'holy love'. If uncleanness is dispensed with there is nothing left but love. Is that not a wonderful conception? Fancy a company permeated by love. God is there, holiness is there. So that the house is not merely a shell; in christendom it is a shell, but it is full of something! We are too doctrinal. Why are we in separation from a thousand things? Many will tell you, 'We have seen in Scripture they are wrong'. Well, that will not cleanse the house. We know a doctrine that it is a service of sons, but we can only take up service in the power of the Spirit. The thing is taken up by the Spirit of God's Son in our hearts, and it is taken up in reality -- it is in our hearts -- God is there.
The hallowing is a progressive thing. It takes sixteen days here (verse 17). It could not be said to be complete in any of us, nor assembly-wise. It is a process that has been going on for over a hundred years.
Ques. These are remnant conditions, so you would not get the complete thought?
{382}
C.A.C. If you retired altogether into the region of the Spirit, would not you find it there?
Rem. That is an individual.
C.A.C. Well, would not twenty such individuals make a company?
Rem. That would not be the whole.
C.A.C. It is the assembly in principle, is it not? We want to be really set for the working out of this in an experimental way. In this chapter something is being carried on that is right, and can any of us be content without the service of God being such as He desires? There is not a meeting on the face of the earth where there is not need for a great deal more hallowing. Are we really committed to the working out of what is pleasing to God?
Ques. What does verse 11 mean?
C.A.C. It suggests that everything is worked out on the line of divine sovereignty as in John's gospel. And that encourages you; God has chosen you; do not be negligent in the service (verse 11). Why has God separated us from much in christendom? I think I could say I am more conscious of my shortcomings than I ever was, but I do not want to give up the thoughts of God, of His house and His service, for all my weakness. Doors are primarily for going out, but we have often been told that the way we go out is the way for God to come in. Ministry and the gifts of the Spirit are given sovereignly (@Ephesians 4).
Ques. What about the gospel?
C.A.C. We find the gospel was not known practically before the recognition of the Spirit. J.N.D. said he never heard it until he preached it. 'Paul's gospel, do you preach it?' was a little book once distributed. And you must have Paul's gospel to see the wonderful character of God's coming out to man; it must be according to His
{383}
own heart. Then there is the building up leading to the service of praise. It is all new to christendom.
Ques. Is what you get in verse 15 a suggestion of the movement of the last century?
C.A.C. Yes it is; and the Lord has helped us and is helping us all the time to see what is suitable to God, and that everything not suitable is unclean.
Rem. There are many names brought in here.
C.A.C. Does it not remind us that the Spirit of God uses vessels? He does not act apart from certain human beings. It is good to recognise the vessels God is using at any given time.
Rem. There should be the ability to recognise the sovereign choice of God.
C.A.C. We ought to know the names of brethren the Lord is using. There are one hundred and sixty names of men given in the New Testament. So there is a divine principle in making known the name of a brother that is going to preach.
Rem. In @Acts 1: 15 it says, "the crowd of names".
C.A.C. There is an idea that mentioning names is making too much of man. If God has made something of Paul, am I not to make anything of Paul? The thing is to recognise what is of God, not what is of man. You value a brother or sister for what is of God there, and especially if you come to something distinctive in levitical service. And every one of the Levites should be set for the cleansing of the house, and all serving on the line of developing love in the saints, so that God can have a house where He can be comfortable and be praised. It is good for any Levite to start out with the knowledge that his name is written in heaven. He will not be inflated then, because it is what is for God that is in his mind. My place with God as a son is infinitely greater than anything I can be as a servant. What Paul was as a son was
{384}
greater than what he was as an apostle.
Rem. It throws us back on the sovereignty of God.
C.A.C. That was what I was thinking. So a real basis is laid for the service to be carried on in the most acceptable manner.
Ques. Why is it "the brook Kidron" (verse 16)?
C.A.C. It is very suggestive that in John's gospel the Lord goes over it on the way to the garden (chapter 18: 1); that will give you a clue. Certainly all the rubbish will be washed away if you get it down there for it is where everything unsuitable to God is washed into oblivion.
Rem. "He went out", it says, it was done deliberately, to meet those moral questions, where He had to say, "Thou art holy" (@Psalm 22: 3).
C.A.C. When this has been brought about, the saints can take up intelligently what is of Christ. Both the sin-offering and the burnt-offering are taken up collectively as the service of the house.
{385}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 29
@2 Chronicles 29: 20 - 36
C.A.C. It is encouraging to see what enlargement there is following the cleansing of the house.
Ques. Is there any significance in the fact that Hezekiah gathered the princes and went up to the house of Jehovah? It links up the thought of priestly direction with what is outside. Then the priests come into view.
C.A.C. The Spirit of God would always exercise the saints as to the cleansing of the house.
Ques. How would you apply it in a practical setting for today?
C.A.C. I think we must admit that the Spirit of God would always be jealous about suitable conditions in the house of God. If things are tolerated that are really filthiness and uncleanness in the sight of God, the way is stopped, is it not? We find that when saints have moved to secure suitable conditions in the house, there has been great enlargement; it is a fixed principle always. That is how spiritual enlargement comes, and it secures enlargement in our outlook on the position in the widest sense; so that though there is a comparatively limited range of movement what is contemplated is proper for "all Israel". There were comparatively few taking it up; the vast majority were captive in Assyria. There is a great place given at once to the sin-offering, which shows how sensitive they were.
Ques. You mean as to the condition of things publicly and the basis on which things can be recovered?
C.A.C. That is what I thought.
{386}
Rem. The cleansing of the temple by the Lord comes very early in John's gospel (chapter 2: 15).
C.A.C. Were you thinking it was a kind of moral requirement consequent on the unfolding of the gospel? That is very interesting and helpful. If there is a thought of things in the service of God being suitable to Him, there is a basis on which the Lord and the Spirit of God can move for great enlargement, and there is a sense of grace. It seems to me that bringing in the sin-offering at this juncture indicated a great sense of grace in the soul of Hezekiah and others.
Ques. Is there a reason for the number seven in verse 21?
C.A.C. I think it is a complete presentation of the sin-offering in every aspect of its value. It is a comprehensive view of the sin-offering, as bearing on the breakdown of the public profession, for that is what it is typically. It is a realisation that all that was professedly for God required the sin-offering -- the kingdom, the sanctuary and Judah -- showing how sensitive they were of what was due to God. As we look around and within, we see the great necessity for the sin-offering. God would have us understand that in His patience and grace He is bearing with christendom on the ground of the death of Christ in spite of so much that is contrary to His pleasure.
Rem. All the congregation identified themselves with the sin-offering by putting their hands on it.
C.A.C. We do not gain much from any exercise unless we do. It is in putting our hands on it that we get the gain.
Ques. Have you any thought as to why the number of the animals was seven?
C.A.C. Oh, I think it shows the complete way in which they took up the exercise. We should understand in a very full way, if we were spiritually exercised and
{387}
addicted ourselves to the cleansing of the house, how available the sin-offering is to the whole christian profession.
Rem. We should come to an understanding of how it affects God.
C.A.C. Yes, and to see that in grace God has provided that the whole character of things displeasing to Him should be thoroughly judged in the sin-offering; He provided for that. The whole system of self-will and lawlessness has been judged for God in the death of Christ and He would have destroyed it long ago but for that. What is here typified is the entering on the part of the remnant into their true position. It is that we might take up in our spirits that God must have it judged, and has done so in the sin-offering of Christ. As we do that we are equal to move in grace in the midst of the whole profession. Hezekiah moves in grace in the whole system of disorder; he thinks of the tribes in captivity in grace, of "all Israel", and sends out an invitation to all Israel in the next chapter to take the passover.
It is a most beautiful suggestion of grace; there is a sin-offering. We often speak of the disorder and rebellion side; well, let us just turn over and think of the sin-offering. So that it is possible for God to deal with every one of His own in grace. Personally it is very important that we should be in the good of the sin-offering ourselves. The judgment of will in the death of Christ is not a theory but to be an established thing in our soul. Even when not thinking of the sacrificial side we find the value of it all gathered up in a Person who is the centre of eternity. On the ground of the sin-offering God bore with men for four thousand years before Christ came; otherwise a man who pretended to be a priest would drop dead in a minute. We must bear in mind that the sin-offering is a means to an end. In one sense it is a negative
{388}
thing, it deals with what is obnoxious to God, and enables Him to go on with a profession that is the most hateful thing that ever came under His eye. The word "atonement" (verse 24) means 'a covering'. It applies to both offerings; it is something that covers sin under the eye of God.
Rem. The burnt-offering is brought in by the sin-offering.
C.A.C. The words that characterise the sin-offering in Leviticus and are referred to again and again are, "And it shall be forgiven him"; but in chapter I they are, "And it shall be accepted for him" (verse 4), which gives a positive thought. If not clear as to the sin-offering we shall not understand much about the burnt-offering. The burnt-offering brings in the thought of what is pleasurable to God; it is an offering of a sweet odour of delight to God.
Ques. Is it like "having made peace by the blood of his cross" (@Colossians 1: 20)?
C.A.C. Yes, reconciliation brings in what is suitable to God, "To present you holy and unblamable and irreproachable before it" (@Colossians 1: 22). Reconciliation brings that about. It is very necessary for us to get hold of the great thoughts of God; He would have all His people before Him clear of every stain, "holy ... irreproachable"; but He would have all of them consciously linked up with His own delight.
Rem. So it is "taken us into favour in the Beloved" (@Ephesians 1: 6).
C.A.C. It is wonderful to see how the Spirit of God in the New Testament causes the offering, so to speak, to merge in the Person, that is, we are not only accepted in the value of what Christ has done, but in the blessedness of what He is Himself as the Beloved, which practically makes a great difference. You could not possibly have types to represent the truth, they can only present parts
{389}
of it; but when we come to the truth as recorded in the New Testament it is greater than any type. It takes all the types put together to represent Christ, and then they do not equal Christ. No offering in the Old Testament was ever raised from the dead (except in type, of course). The wonderful thing is that all the sweet odour brought out in Christ as in the place of sin is all carried over in Himself into resurrection and ascension and eternity, and it is in the glorified Man at God's right hand we are accepted; and we have to bring all that into the burnt-offering to get our conception of it.
Rem. 'Eternity's begun', as we sing.
C.A.C. Yes. He chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world. It was in that One whom He loved that He chose us, when there was no other thought, nothing but delight. He chose us in Christ that we might be for His delight for eternity. So at His birth the angelic host spoke of God's delight in men. We have little idea of the exceeding delight of God in us.
Rem. We want to learn more what the Beloved is to Him.
Rem. The best robe, the ring and the sandals were his in @Luke 15.
C.A.C. That is it; he was made conscious that he was not a penitent, forgiven sinner but an object of the father's heart. If we do not touch that in some measure (and the youngest can do that, for the gospel brings this to us, it is teaching for babes in Christ), we shall not understand the song of the Lord.
Rem. I think we all want to know more of this.
C.A.C. So we are moved over into the region of divine complacency and delight. It involves that the saints are viewed as the brethren of Christ. David is the great leader of song in Scripture, and is typical of Christ. As we know He sings in the midst of the assembly.
{390}
Ques. What would "the moment the burnt-offering began, the song of Jehovah began" suggest (verse 27)?
C.A.C. It seems the moment we touch that in the assembly, the song of Jehovah begins.
Ques. Would it be when it was true of the Lord?
C.A.C. And when the saints were brought into it by ministry, particularly by the ministry of the gospel of John. It is the celebration of God as known in the effectuation of His own delight. So anybody who gets any idea of it is supremely happy, the song begins. That is why we are supremely happy in the assembly. And it is for "all Israel"; there is nothing restricted in what is of God. It is taken up representatively for we do not touch anything in the assembly that is not the divinely given portion of all the saints. Why are they not there?
Ques. The conditions later in the chapter are not up to this practically; there were not enough priests. Is that the responsible side?
C.A.C. Yes, I think we get the complete thought first, then a challenge as to how far we are ready to take it up practically. This is one of those remarkable Old Testament scriptures which could hardly have been understood until these last days.
Rem. Certain things are done in Christendom that prevent an entrance into this.
C.A.C. That is right, and until the cleansing has been taken up, no one will come into it. There must be some purpose of heart to please God; in Christendom things are done to please man. Directly any think on this line, saints get great enlargement in their thoughts as to Christ and as to the saints as linked up with Christ. As we are on the line of being hallowed and hallowing all those things that have to do with the house of God, we see how God has provided for the complete judgment of everything displeasing to Him in the sin-offering; and in the
{391}
burnt-offering what is completely for His pleasure in Christ, and in the saints as accepted in Him, and then the song begins; we can praise Jehovah for what He is, for His wonderful thoughts that have come to light.
Ques. In verse 23, would you say how we lay our hands on, how we do it?
C.A.C. It seems to me, if one may speak practically, the Lord brings us on the first day of the week to identification with His death collectively. Of course, we have to take up the exercise individually in baptism; a moment comes in our history when we are ready to take it up, do you not think? A moment comes when we obey "from the heart the form of teaching into which ye were instructed" (@Romans 6: 17), and I have no doubt it means baptism. That is very much like putting our hands on it.
Rem. Actually in the Supper you do put your hand to it.
C.A.C. And in the actual service of the assembly that comes first. We all do that ostensibly, the Lord only knows how far it is true of each individual. We break bread on that footing. I like to think many of the brethren are much deeper in it, and more real than I am, but we are all on that footing. I think what we get here is more a collective exercise; we come together on that basis, that what we were in the flesh has been judged in the death of Christ, and we are thankful for it. Otherwise we should be serving God in the flesh, whereas the only way He can be served is in the Spirit.
{392}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 30
@2 Chronicles 30: 1 - 27
Ques. Would you say a word as to the song of Jehovah when the burnt-offering began? The worshippers are secured, and the offerings seem outstanding at the end of the previous chapter.
C.A.C. It seems clear that the house being cleansed, and the sin-offering and the burnt-offering having been presented for all Israel, there was nothing to hinder the celebration of God's praise, so that the service of the house was set in order in every part of it.
Rem. And in type the worshippers are secured, the people all secured as worshippers as well as the service and offerings secured. "The Father seeks such as his worshippers" (@John 4: 23).
Ques. I wondered why the song of Jehovah was connected with the burnt-offering and the latter part of the chapter is principally connected with the burnt-offering. Is the burnt-offering connected with a willing people, the expression of a people who really understand what is for God's own pleasure?
C.A.C. Yes, that is what I thought. If the sin-offering speaks of the removal of what is displeasing to God, the burnt-offering brings in the additional thought of what is pleasing to God, so that in connection with the burnt-offering we get what is spoken of as the excess. The thing is established officially, or perhaps a better word is, ministerially. That is, the sin-offering and burnt-offering are presented by the direction of the king, and the song of Jehovah begins and continues as long as the burnt-offering
{393}
is continued; and then it would seem the people took their cue from that, the door was opened for a willing people to bring their offerings. They had apprehended what it set forth, and they came forward to participate in that character of offering.
Rem. It says the priests were too few.
C.A.C. I think what marks these chapters is that while there is so much that is precious and delightful to God, yet there is a falling short of the full mind of God in how He would be served. So this chapter is peculiarly suited to a day like this when there is such a universal falling short of what is pleasurable to God. It is a very searching exercise for "the Levites were more upright in heart to hallow themselves than the priests" (chapter 29: 34). I think perhaps there is more faithfulness in levitical service than in priestly service now. I think it marks the time. How many are really earnest and faithful in priestly service Godward?
Rem. The Father seeking worshippers seems to underlie the whole service of Christ.
C.A.C. Yes, I am sure that is so. We do not see any great amount of fitness to minister to the service of God and it is brought forth as a reproof, the priests are behind. It marks these two chapters that there is a falling short of what is for God's heart. The Levites being upright are promoted; I think God always promotes an upright man.
Rem. As to the burnt-offering, it says, "Christ loved us, and delivered himself up for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour" (@Ephesians 5: 2).
C.A.C. Yes, that is the fulness of it. Ephesians is the fulness of everything, it is the will of God in its completeness. You cannot add anything to Ephesians.
Rem. So it is there, glory to God in the assembly.. With the saints together it is in view of taking up service:
{394}
in the full height.
C.A.C. Typically we see the house of God and its service in its completeness in chapter 29, so there is a very suitable centre for the service of God's people. Although there is a deficiency on the part of the priests, there is a gathering centre for all Israel.
Rem. There is deficiency abroad.
C.A.C. Still, they had risen over the brink. When you get what is in God's heart, you cannot shut it up; it goes out to all saints. It is only secured in one spot, if you could think of such a thing as the holiness of God's house and His service secured in one spot only; it is available for all saints. If something that is suitable to God is secured, it necessarily becomes a rallying-point for all saints, and all ought to say, 'We want to be there, where God's mind is answered to'. It raises the question as to whether we have hallowed ourselves and are ready to take up this service.
Rem. The strangers had part in the rejoicing (verse 25).
C.A.C. God took pains always to show there was room in His heart for the stranger.
Rem. All recovery is the sovereign work of God.
C.A.C. Yes, and that is the greatest comfort, for if God is moving there is stability and continuance with it; it is not going to break down.
Ques. What difference is there between "the consecrated things" (chapter 29: 33) and the burnt-offerings?
C.A.C. I suppose it is just the difference between worship and fellowship. The burnt-offering would be the worship side of things; they are spoken of as whole burnt-offerings, they all go up to God. The consecrated offerings would extend to the peace-offerings, in which the people participated, which answered to fellowship, which we enjoy at the present time. Of course, God has His portion in the peace-offering, it is not left out,
{395}
because if the saints are enjoying Christ, God has His portion. The drink-offering is to bring in divine joy. It is poured out in the holy place, speaking of what ministers to the joy of God, in which God's people have their part.
Rem. The range of offerings raises a question as to how far we have reached in our souls in this system of service, whether we have reached worship. It says, "The service of the house of Jehovah was set in order" (verse 35).
Ques. Do we need to value rightly each feature of this service, whether Godward or on the line of fellowship which enters into the loaf and the cup?
C.A.C. Yes.
Ques. Why is there reference to the thing being done suddenly?
C.A.C. I suppose it would be evidence that it was the work of God, not a thing that had been hurriedly planned and contrived and carried through; and when God works things are done quickly. It was carried through quickly.
Rem. They came out of Egypt in haste.
C.A.C. You see there was a ministry of the assembly and of Christ's death, and it laid hold of saints everywhere.
Ques. Is it a question of condition?
C.A.C. I think the question is raised as to whether we value the passover. I was thinking of it in connection with the divine thought that God would have a people entirely delivered from the world.
Rem. If the conditions are present God will respond suddenly.
C.A.C. Yes, what is so humbling is there is so much slowness of movement on our part. We find while they were doing what was right in chapter 29, they were tardy in doing it, so that they had not things in order in time to do it. It was the sixteenth day of the month before the
{396}
cleansing of the house (chapter 29: 17), it was too late. They should have started earlier. The fourteenth day of the month was the appointed day for the passover so they were all behind. They did not keep it until the second month.
Ques. What is it for us if we miss it, or are too late?
C.A.C. We see there is an unreadiness, not a sufficient number of priests, and the people not gathered at Jerusalem, all was too late. Instead of the appointed time, they had to take advantage of God's provision in abnormal times, a provision of grace.
Rem. Everything seems to be abnormal all the way through, and yet God carries things through.
C.A.C. Yes, and He bears with things in patient grace, with things that do not come up to the standard before Him. If He would not have anything but the very best, He would not have much now.
Ques. What do the bearers of the letters represent?
C.A.C. There was the desire on the part of the king that all Israel should take up their relations with God. We should carry the invitation to others who are in bondage.
Ques. It would apply to ourselves?
C.A.C. Yes, I think so. The setting is that the house is cleansed and the service set in order so there is a suitable centre for the people to gather together to keep the passover. That is the connection in which it starts.
Rem. With reference to @Numbers 9 it is a serious matter when what was intended as an opportunity for the Jew had to be taken up by all. It was never supposed that all Israel would wait.
C.A.C. No, it shows the sad state of Israel and Judah that what was due to God had not been kept for a long time, many years had elapsed without the passover being held.
{397}
Ques. Why does it bring in "from Beer-sheba even to Dan"? It is a very wide sphere.
C.A.C. Yes, it is the whole of Israel. Though ten tribes had been carried up to Assyria the message is sent from Dan to Beer-sheba, and the opportunity afforded for all to hold the passover to Jehovah.
Ques. Is there anything to correspond with the collective thought of the passover? We have often connected it with the individual.
C.A.C. In Scripture it is clearly an assembly matter, is it not?
Rem. "Let us celebrate the feast" (@1 Corinthians 5: 8).
C.A.C. Yes, and in @Exodus 12. 1 think the Lord expects us to be able to perceive that He has brought the passover thought into His supper. I think the apostles quite understood when the Lord instituted the Supper that He was transferring the memorial thought from the passover to the Supper.
Ques. Are all to keep the passover though not necessarily together?
C.A.C. Yes surely, we keep the feast all the week. The passover reminded Israel that God had His own brought out of Egypt that they might be hallowed sons for His service. The passover had that in memorial on every occasion that it was held. Now the Lord's death has that in mind. It is to be continually referred to, as to how the Lord brought His people out of Egypt, not merely as delivered from judgment, but that they might serve Him as hallowed sons. I think it is the greatest feast because it is the basis of all the feasts. It is God's basis for His people to come out of the world for His pleasure. We do not want to fail of the passover. The death of Christ is the way He has gone out of the world, and He has left it to be the way for us out of the world.
Rem. So Leviticus follows Exodus. Exodus is
{398}
"brought out", and Leviticus is "serving Him as brought out".
Ques. While the Supper is distinct from the passover, is it right to have certain thoughts as to the passover at the beginning of the Supper?
C.A.C. We want to get the divine thought of it. The Lord had great desire to eat the passover with His disciples before He suffered. What was there in His heart that made it so precious to Him? Surely not just the saving by the blood. God had a way of bringing His elect people out of the world in the virtue and value of the death of Christ, and we do not want to lose that in connection with the breaking of the bread and the drinking of the cup; we want to have a very definite thought as to how God has secured us for His pleasure and it is to be a memorial to all generations. It is those that have come out of the world by the death of Christ, to be risen with Christ, and who appreciate His manifestation of Himself, that alone can serve Him in the assembly. God brought His people out of Egypt, "my firstborn" (@Exodus 4: 22), He said, to serve Him, stamping on the affections of the saints for all time that they were brought out of the world to minister to His pleasure. Now the Lord brings the memorial into a new setting. The memorial is of a Person who went out of the world by death and made a way for us out of it.
{399}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 30
@2 Chronicles 30: 10 - 27
C.A.C. I think that the previous chapter provided conditions according to which the people could be called together to hold the passover which was the great memorial feast at that time, the original footing on which their relations with God were established; and, of course, in that connection it is well to remember that the assembly is the first company to take up the passover. As we have understood, I think, all was typical in that day. There was in reality no lamb without blemish and without spot until Christ came. The assembly is able to say, "For also our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed" (@1 Corinthians 5: 7), and so the assembly is the first company to take up the passover. Israel will take it up in a coming day, but not quite in the same way as the saints of the assembly.
Rem. You have remarked that there is an additional feature each time the passover is taken up as a feast in the Old Testament.
C.A.C. Yes, I think that is so.
Ques. What would be the distinctive feature here?
C.A.C. I suppose the recognition that it was to be taken up in a priestly way in relation to the house of Jehovah.
Rem. Verse 8, "Come to his sanctuary", puts it on a high plane.
C.A.C. Yes, and suggests it could only be rightly held to Jehovah in the place where He dwells, and therefore it must be accompanied by holy and priestly conditions.
{400}
But we find in the chapter conditions come short of the divine requirements, which would indicate that the passover rather corresponds in this chapter with the way it is spoken of in Corinthians. The passover and the Lord's supper are spoken of together in the institution, and were taken up in Corinth in a manner far short of the divine mind. For instance, "Our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed" -- why did he say that? Why did he leave out the thought of eating?
Ques. Was he stressing the sacrificial side?
C.A.C. Yes, I do not think he could say anything about eating at Corinth; those who do so are inwardly in accord with the sacrifice, with the death and judgment-bearing of Christ. He could not say they were so at Corinth.
Ques. Is the feast of unleavened bread brought in because of recovery?
C.A.C. And the apostle is anxious the feast should be kept at Corinth, that there should be a purging out of old leaven, and a new lump that was unleavened. If that is not the case, there is no true basis for coming together to eat the Lord's supper.
Rem. It says, "And thus eat" (@1 Corinthians 11: 28 ).
C.A.C. There is no setting out of the Lord's supper in its spiritual import in Corinthians. The eating and drinking there is the outward thing, and he reverts at once to the grave responsibility everyone came under in eating the Supper, and they would come under judgment just as in this chapter Jehovah was angry and smote them with disease. Paul says it was not to eat the Lord's supper, he does not hesitate to say it.
If the assembly were practically a new lump, an unleavened lump, there would be nothing to hinder the spiritual apprehension and appropriation of what is connected with the Lord's supper, but if leaven is working
{401}
there can be no spiritual apprehension of the loaf and the cup in the Supper.
Ques. Is there a good state indicated in Judah in the hand of God being upon them, to give them one heart and so on?
C.A.C. Yes, there was a unity produced by the word of God, and it brought about that certain of Asher and Manasseh and Zebulun humbled themselves.
Ques. Would it mean they were learning to judge the carnal mind?
C.A.C. Yes, "If we judged ourselves, so were we not judged", Paul says (@1 Corinthians 11: 31).
Ques. If you connect the cross with the wrong man, is that unpardonable in God's sight?
C.A.C. Say what is in your mind.
Rem. It is not in its right setting here, I mean, they were late, and some were not cleansed.
C.A.C. Yes, it corresponds to Corinthian conditions, does it not? People who are really in accord with the death of Christ are entirely separate from the world, and give no allowance to the flesh, which is always marked by self-importance and inflation. Well, eating the passover and keeping the feast would free us inwardly from what is of the world and of the flesh, so that there might be a new lump, an unleavened lump, and then the Lord can really be before us. The great point in the passover was that Jehovah was to be before the people: it was held before Jehovah, and it was spoken of as the offering of Jehovah, and sacrifice of Jehovah, and feast of Jehovah. Its very character depended on Jehovah being, as it were, present to the hearts of His people, and His great deliverance the footing on which He had placed them with Himself. We need to keep up that kind of exercise continually.
Ques. Would the sprinkling of the blood show that
{402}
conditions were secured from God's side? The uncleanness arises at once as far as the people's side is concerned.
C.A.C. The death of Christ is the ground on which God can take His firstborn sons out of the world for His pleasure and service, but then there are exercises on our side that come in; all the rites and ordinances connected with the passover are essential for us.
Ques. What are they for us?
C.A.C. The necessity of our being inwardly in accord with the death of Christ, and of taking care to exclude the leaven, those are the rites and ordinances. It is an exercise that saints of the assembly have to take up, so that there is the connecting with the death of Christ the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. We have to be genuine in our inward exercises in relation to the death of Christ, taking things up in a genuine way.
Rem. The prayer for forgiveness by Hezekiah (verse 18).
C.A.C. I think he recognises that things had not been taken up "according to the purification of the sanctuary" (verse 19), and he prayed for Jehovah's hand to heal, for they were stricken with disease, just as many at Corinth were weak and sickly. But I suppose Jehovah was good also to them at Corinth, for through repentance He brought things back to the right conditions of the sanctuary. The second epistle to the Corinthians is the sanctuary.
Ques. What is faced in verse 14?
C.A.C. Certain things that challenged the rights of Jehovah had to be dealt with in a summary manner; and so it is today, souls will not move into right relations with divine Persons if they do not deal definitely with these things. There is a provision for abnormal times, and I think almost everything we take up today is adapted to abnormal times, is it not?
{403}
Ques. Would the recognition of that help to keep us humble and free from pretension, for we are all part of it?
C.A.C. Yes, quite so, and it is all essential to our coming intelligently to the Lord's supper and understanding it.
Rem. "All Israel" are not in this.
C.A.C. They would not come.
Rem. Provision is made so that the service can go on, though things were abnormal.
Rem. Some were not at Jerusalem.
C.A.C. I think what is universal has to be recognised. There is no true gathering together of saints now except in recognition of what is universal; so meetings on independent ground are out of it altogether, they are not at Jerusalem. The Holy Spirit has formed the body and acts and moves in the body, and that is a universal thought.
Ques. Would Hezekiah in prayer (verse 18) be a type of Christ as our great High Priest?
C.A.C. Yes, we need the Lord's grace to enable us rightly to eat His supper.
Rem. The two sides are given in Hebrews: our High Priest, the companion side, and a great Priest over the house of God, the service side.
C.A.C. And we need the Lord's help and support to bring us to see that His supper is connected with Paul's ministry; it was given to Paul in connection with his ministry, so that we take it up in that connection as linked with the truth of the assembly.
Ques. The outcome seems to be that they can eat the peace-offering. Is that leading up to liberty in the service of God?
C.A.C. Yes, and in our case the Lord's supper is what helps us greatly into liberty, His body given for us and
{404}
His blood poured out for us; it is all to be appropriated.
Rem. Only those at Jerusalem had the great joy.
C.A.C. Yes, really what the Lord has in view for us is that we should be supremely happy. I suppose the cup enters into that, not only that we are to have Himself before us and be filled up in our relations to Him, but that we should be supremely happy with God. The loaf has to do with our relations with Christ, and the cup with our relations with God; but then it is the Lord who in love secures both for us.
Rem. So it is "Me" in both cases.
C.A.C. Yes, so that we think of the Lord. It is wonderful that He should come into flesh and blood that He might use that condition to express His love to the assembly, and He has given His body for the assembly.
Ques. For "seven days" -- what is that?
C.A.C. Oh! the whole period.
Rem. There are two seven-day periods.
C.A.C. Yes, that was excess.
Rem. There were two seven-day periods in Solomon's time.
C.A.C. Yes.
Rem. They are so happy in it; they went on again, do you suggest?
C.A.C. Yes, there is always liberty for things to be extended. All the truth that has been made known to us concerning the passover and the Lord's supper has been wonderfully extended and expanded during the last one hundred and more years.
Ques. The whole congregation was secured in reference to the second seven days; would it be looking on to the complete thought that God will ultimately bring all His people into it?
C.A.C. It was the whole company in principle. So that we understand the loaf sets forth the complete
{405}
thought. The loaf that we break, all that Christ brought into manhood is for the assembly's appropriation, so that as appropriating Christ she becomes His counterpart, a new thing in the earth, a company that has appropriated in its affections all that came here in the body of Christ and is available to the saints in His death; and the precious features that came out in that body are to come out in the saints as a satisfaction for the love of Christ.
Rem. The Lord says, "I will no more drink at all of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God" (@Mark 14: 25 ). It would be the expression of the delight of God.
C.A.C. I think He is looking on to the fulfilment of things in the kingdom of God on the earthly side. Meanwhile He lays out this precious truth of His body and blood given for the assembly, which does not belong to the earthly side at all.
Ques. Would the heave-offering have reference to what is for God?
C.A.C. And the Lord has that in view in the cup. In giving us the cup He has in view that we should be in perfect liberty and joy with God, drinking in in the power of the Spirit what God is as made known in His blessed love, in His nature. The Lord gives us to drink into it, so as to be filled with the blessedness of God, so it provides a condition of great happiness in the assembly in relation to God, which, of course, surpasses anything we get in type. The first thing is we have to begin with the loaf, so all that came here in the body of Christ has been dedicated in love to the assembly, and is to be appropriated by the assembly, and we call the Lord to mind in that connection. He has left that condition of flesh and blood, so the One we call to mind is glorified. He has been into death for us, but is now glorified; and the Lord was in spirit beyond death when He instituted the
{406}
Supper, because He said, "This is my body which is given for you" (@Luke 22: 19). It was not actually given then but He speaks of it as accomplished. Verse 22 is a very beautiful verse; there are persons that have understanding in the good knowledge of Jehovah. It sets forth what the saints are brought into as drinking the cup of blessing, as having the good knowledge of God. The Supper is on that line, it is what He conferred on the assembly. The goodness of God comes out in a special way when all is so full of shortcomings. He says, "my people shall be satisfied with my goodness" (@Jeremiah 31:14). What a beautiful expression that is!
Rem. We see the result in verse 27.
C.A.C. It is encouraging that the Lord is the Originator of the whole thing.
Ques. Is consolation connected with the Supper?
C.A.C. I think the Lord in taking up the custom of breaking bread and a cup of consolation was giving it a new character. It is connected originally with mourning (@Jeremiah 16: 7). There is none connected with the Supper, it is a eucharist, a thanksgiving; a season of unmixed joy, you might say, takes the place of the bitter herbs. His death was behind Him. In spirit He was past death when He instituted the Supper, clearly so. We come together in the sense that the Lord is glorified. It is the 'calling of Me to mind' -- that is in glory. He once gave His life for the assembly, that is past, but it is now connected with His present position in His glorified condition, the 'Me' is in heaven; He is not on the cross. We would be freer in the service of praise if we entered more into this; we are slow in apprehending His body being given for the assembly; that is to be apprehended, for there is that on the earth that has gathered up for itself what has come here in the richness and blessedness of it, so that she has become His counterpart for the satisfaction of His love.
{407}
Ques. Why does it say, "In the night in which he was delivered up" (@1 Corinthians 11: 23 )?
C.A.C. To emphasise the solemn conditions that were here; "The night in which he was delivered up" brings out the unfaithfulness and terrible wickedness of man. It was just at that moment when murder filled all the scene that He brings out what His love conferred on the assembly (for the disciples were that in principle), that is, He conferred *Himself* on the assembly.
{408}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 31
@2 Chronicles 31: 1 - 21
Rem. The last verse of the preceding chapter is a striking climax to all that had gone before.
C.A.C. Yes, it would appear to set forth in a striking way the taking up of the true position which belonged to them as before God, answering in our day to the taking up, after many years of departure, of the true place and privilege of the assembly.
Rem. It is striking that it says, "Their prayer came up to his holy habitation"; the Lord's name is not mentioned, as though there was no occasion for it.
C.A.C. It was all so definite in relation to Him that His name did not need to be mentioned, as in "Tell me where thou hast laid *him*" (@John 20: 15).
Rem. @Numbers 6 says, "Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel" (verse 23).
C.A.C. He is always delighted when He gets an outlet for His heart.
Rem. This is spiritual intuition rather than order, as understanding the mind of God.
Rem. It "came up to his holy habitation, to the heavens" (chapter 30: 27).
C.A.C. Yes indeed, so that the service should not only be a happy one for us but minister to the pleasure of God. They held the passover to Jehovah in the previous chapter, and all the service of the assembly would be robbed of its value if it were not done to the Lord and to God. Unless divine Persons are before us and They
{409}
get satisfaction, the object of the service is not reached; and tasting the blessedness of that God would bring us to judge all that is round about us in christendom. That is the standpoint, He would have it judged by those in the enjoyment of divine blessedness. It is a great matter for divine Persons that what is displeasing to Them should be judged; it may be negative, but it is an important matter.
Rem. "God has judged your judgment upon her", it says of Babylon (@Revelation 18: 20).
C.A.C. I was thinking of that. God is pleased to bring it about that the saints judge as He does; and it is from the standpoint of assembly privilege and blessedness that these things are judged.
Ques. What would the "columns" (verse 1) represent?
C.A.C. They would represent all the things in christendom that hinder God being known and apprehended; an idol takes the place of God. But these things are only truly judged by those who taste the privileges of the assembly. Having tasted what is true and of God, there is with them an intuitive horror of everything contrary to it; the saints feeling with God's feelings about it, and that is no small thing with God. So, as in Corinth, we hate all these things in ourselves and are morally apart from them. So conditions came about for the service to be taken up in the appropriate order.
Rem. There must be the judgment of what is contrary to God first.
C.A.C. Yes, there is liberty, and every brother and sister here is set at liberty in the service of God. If I do not take part it is entirely my own fault. We are set free from all that diverts from the service, each to serve in his place and according to his appointed service.
Ques. It says every man returned to his possession. I wondered if there is a movement marking them by the
{410}
judgment of certain things and then an individual movement to their own possession; do we not need to be exercised in what is under our individual control before we can enter on the service of God?
C.A.C. Yes, so that the enjoyment of the inheritance must come first before the service of the priests and Levites can be taken up. The inheritance contributes to the house of God by what was ministered in that way as we see in the chapter.
Rem. Our households must be in order.
C.A.C. I think that is most important. So that we cannot get the service carried on by individual brothers independent of the general state. We have to learn that the spiritual prosperity of the saints generally is essential to priestly and levitical service. There is liberty for each to serve and give thanks and praise in the gates of the courts of Jehovah. It is a wonderful moment of privilege; we hardly realise the restrictions there are in christendom. All should be carried on in liberty, in order of course, but it is a scene of beautiful liberty. So every brother and sister is free; we all come together in assembly to contribute and not to listen only, though we all do listen; and what is expressed depends on what I bring.
Ques. What if a man brings nothing?
C.A.C. I am faced with a very serious matter, because God says, "None shall appear in my presence empty" (@Exodus 23: 15). God has no pleasure at all in empty people.
Ques. Is there the element of conscription to it?
C.A.C. Yes, I think so, and it is beautiful that in the more formal part the substance was supplied by the king, that is, the king charges himself with the supply; and have we not to take account of Christ as the One who supplies everything for the service? So if I am empty, I
{411}
had better get to Him about it. Nothing goes up in sweet savour to God that is not of His substance for we are all enriched by His substance, so a saint can hardly be empty when He has Christ. Why do people come, why do they want to break bread, if they do not appreciate Christ? One such would say, 'It is because I think highly of Christ, and that is my company, and I want to be with them'. And the Supper enriches us. If we come empty we are greeted at the very outset by the words, "This is my body which is for you". Now if we take that in, we are not empty.
Rem. The very object of the Supper is that we appropriate all that has come to us in the incarnation of the Son, and are set at liberty with God in the power of Christ's blood. It is all supplied by the King. Oh! the assembly is a wonderful company. Mr Stoney used to say, 'It is the most august company on earth', and so it is.
Ques. We do not get filled until we have partaken, would you say?
C.A.C. I think that the Lord in His love provides a filling when we do come, but surely we have the privilege of anticipating it.
Ques. Would all the substance have burnt-offering character?
C.A.C. Does it not suggest that all that is of sweet savour to God is of Christ? We come together as thinking nothing of ourselves, but all engaged with the blessed thought that Christ is the Son of the Father's love and that He is so delightful to God, and we realise we are in Him before the Father's face. What could be more blessed than that? There is great liberty in coming together and we enjoy our portion in Christ very much more when together. As individuals it is mixed up with personal exercises, and in the assembly we drop all that and we merge in the company which is blessed in Christ
{412}
according to the purpose of divine love. As we look around, the saints represent the whole company to us and we view them according to their calling. Well, that is liberty. When we get on to that plane, our hearts are free to praise and give thanks (verse 2).
Rem. The Supper was to secure the service of praise.
C.A.C. It was intended to unify the saints in their appreciation of the Lord. You have no other Person before you; otherwise you are not paying attention to what is going on. "This is my body which is given for you" and "My blood, which is poured out for you" (@Luke 22: 19, 20). That excluded every other person. The great subject of this chapter is really that we are all to contribute to what is priestly and levitical. The privilege is extended to all the people; they bring the firstfruits and all the tithes.
Rem. It is "all Israel".
C.A.C. When the Lord said "for you", He had the whole assembly in view. We get limited if we think of what is local. It is very striking, the abundance; they brought "heaps", it says.
Rem. It must have been theirs.
C.A.C. But they realised now it was their privilege to bring of the very best for the strengthening of what was priestly and levitical. Every spiritual acquisition is intended to strengthen and enrich what is priestly and levitical, first in myself, and then in the brethren, so that those elements may be enlarged and strengthened in the assembly. There is a kind of moral order in it. All that caused departure must be judged, but in the light of what is positive. You can hardly think of anyone enjoying the assembly and going back to formal religion; you could hardly conceive of it. There is a great deal of spiritual wealth that is latent, but it was liberated on this occasion and brought. So there is a great store of dedicated and
{413}
consecrated things for the support of all that is priestly and levitical. If a meeting goes heavily sometimes you wonder if the tithes and firstfruits have been brought in.
Ques. What is to be done with what is left?
C.A.C. It is to be drawn upon at need. Think of what has been accumulated in the assembly during the last hundred years.
Ques. How can we bring to light what is latent?
G.A.C. I suppose the light of the service of God rises in our hearts so that we long to contribute. The feeblest believer is attracted by the thought that God can be served for His pleasure. The widow did not have much, but she had two mites and she put them in the treasury. She had the thought of the service of God, had she not?
Rem. Everything has come to us through that blessed Person.
C.A.C. And that understood in a number of hearts unified in the appreciation of it acquires great value before God.
Ques. Is that what constitutes the foundations of the heaps?
C.A.C. Yes, quite so. There were four months of acquiring these heaps; so Hezekiah was moved to bless Jehovah and His people when he saw them.
Ques. What do all these things suggest in verses 5 and 6?
C.A.C. Everything was the result of the blessing of God in the inheritance and is now brought to enhance His service.
Ques. Why is honey brought into it?
C.A.C. It is a part of the wealth of the land. It says, "A land flowing with milk and honey" (@Exodus 3: 8).
Rem. It would be the product of what is mutual.
C.A.C. It speaks of great mutuality in contribution. Every bee brings its load to the hive, which is really a
{414}
beautiful figure of the assembly; each bringing what it finds to the general store. These things set forth all that is connected with our portion in Christ. The land is typical of all we partake of in common in Christ; all is part of the inheritance.
Rem. If a bee does not bring any honey, it is drastically dealt with by the others.
C.A.C. There is no room in the hive for an unproductive bee.
Ques. Why is there no honey in the offerings?
C.A.C. Because, I suppose, it represents there the sweetness of nature, it is not acceptable, it cannot be offered as sweet savour. There is much natural affection and kindness shown in the family and amongst the brethren that is comforting, but is not of spiritual value; it is of no sacrificial value. Here it is of value. Paul prays that we may be knit together in love so that we have the full assurance of understanding, as if to say, 'We will not understand anything unless first knit together'.
Rem. In Ephesians, our inheritance is spoken of before God's inheritance. "In whom we have also obtained an inheritance" (chapter 1: 11).
C.A.C. Yes, there is nothing for God unless we cultivate our inheritance. There is the possibility of ministering to what is levitical in a fleshly way whereas we have the privilege of ministering to those who serve in a priestly way. It is clearly the will of God that we should think of those that serve; and we care for them, not in a partial or limited way; we regard them as representative of the levitical service; we do not think of criticising. We are highly favoured of God to further it; it is a privilege not an exaction. We regard them all in the light of verse 18: "For in their trust they hallowed themselves to be holy". That is how we regard the servants. It would be an unworthy thought of any servant of the Lord to think
{415}
that he had not hallowed himself to be holy. We are assured that what we give will be used unselfishly and sacrificially in exactly the same sense in which the saints give it. It is part of the privilege of the assembly and we want to dismiss from our minds all unworthy thoughts which Satan would suggest to us. If so we render our gift valueless. The widow did not wait to think of those in charge of the treasury, her affections were stirred (she had very little -- just two mites); she had nothing before her but the worthiness of Jehovah. We are very limited in what we do in this way, but that is the principle. The Lord takes account of all that is given affectionately for His name, because of His worthiness. If a brother has not the character we have been speaking of, we should not think of ministering to him.
{416}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 32
@2 Chronicles 32: 1 - 23
Rem. The faithfulness that marked Hezekiah was very precious in the last two verses of chapter 31.
C.A.C. It would seem that the faithfulness that appears in Hezekiah was the reason why the attack came from Sennacherib, the enemy observing it as something reserved for God and that he would stop.
Rem. It is in principle, "All indeed who desire to live piously in Christ Jesus will be persecuted" (@2 Timothy 3: 12).
C.A.C. Yes. The enemy has only two methods of attack against God and His people: one is corruption and the other is violence. The first is more ready. In this chapter it is violence; he would seek to strike terror into the people of God, so that they should give way. I think that has been largely the object of the enemy in recent years. He is always against Christ and the assembly. If God has set up a testimony of what is in His own mind, we may be sure Satan would work everything so as to oppose it, and he will use the present war to intimidate the people of God and give them to surrender the ground that has been won. But we see the enemy was defeated in this chapter, and we can see it even in our time. In spite of destructive power, the privileges of the saints are loved and valued, and the service of God goes on. In another country they have not had the experience of outward destruction that we have had, but the powers that be are not in their favour as they are here. They are most favourable to us. There is no direct attack against the
{417}
saints, but they come under a kind of intimidating influence, and it is good to see that in the power and grace of God the ground has been held.
Ques. What would you say "the fountains of waters ... outside the city" were? The service of God is to go out from the city to bring others into it.
Rem. The reason for the stopping of the fountains was that no help should be afforded to the enemy.
Rem. There is a diverting of the water without stopping its flow in verse 30.
C.A.C. Evidently the desire was that the enemy should not find something that he could take advantage of, and there was great care and labour that it should be not possible for him to benefit by the waters.
Ques. What does the water signify?
C.A.C. Well, I should like help. The enemy could not be advantaged by what is spiritual.
Rem. In these matters you usually see the government of God acting. These fountains here refer more to what is inward and spiritual among the people of God and the enemy could corrupt them. Care for the spiritual side of things is preservation.
Rem. The thought of the fountain is striking in John's gospel. It "shall become in him a fountain ..:" (@John 4: 14); and there is the side, too, of "out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water" (@John 7: 38). There are the two sides. The outside here seems to be restricted.
C.A.C. I think that faith will never seek to stop the flow of what is spiritual. I thought that what was striking at the end of the church's history was the availability of the water for everybody.
Rem. It is restricted.
C.A.C. In the gospel period?
Rem. There are those who attack it.
C.A.C. If there is a stopping of the flow of what is
{418}
spiritual, it is never on the side of faith, but on the side of unbelief.
Ques. This is not of faith, you say. The enemy might want to stop our meetings?
C.A.C. I do not think that in the dispensation of the Spirit you could conceive of the stopping of what is spiritual, but it is a very deep exercise lest the enemy could use anything against it. The water here is something that the enemy might take advantage of. Paul was very careful of his conduct with the Corinthians that the enemy might not take the advantage. He placed great restraint on himself. That is what seems to be here in principle. The fountains of water are hardly to be taken in a spiritual sense. One cannot think of the flow of the Spirit being hindered by the attack of the enemy, but we should expect a special flow of the Spirit then.
Ques. What do the fountains of waters mean?
C.A.C. It seems to me there are certain natural resources we have to be careful about, especially in a time of difficulty when the enemy is bringing pressure to bear upon us. We have to be careful what we make use of, just as Paul at Corinth took great care not to use the wisdom of words or natural eloquence; it did not enter into his service.
Rem. He says that the things that happened to him "turned out rather to the furtherance of the glad tidings" (@Philippians 1: 12).
C.A.C. Exactly. We have to be full of jealous care lest there may be anything in our service or conduct that the enemy can work upon.
Rem. The enemy could have poisoned those waters with infidelity, because what he says is terrible.
C.A.C. I think that seems to be the suggestion, that anything that might serve the enemy is to be stopped. It cost Paul a good deal to put a check upon all his natural
{419}
powers.
Rem. He says he was with them in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.
C.A.C. He was really stopping the flow of anything that would help the enemy. When the enemy attacks we have to see to it that we are really moving in the power of God and not of what is natural. These water supplies are outside the city and so do not represent what is spiritual but what the enemy might use. This provision is made, but does not quite stand in relation to Sennacherib.
Ques. What would the wall being built up to the towers signify?
C.A.C. I suppose it is the thought of the building up of all that is requisite for the testimony, what is of God. The fortified cities have some reference to the assemblies, and Jerusalem is the great universal truth connected with Christ and the assembly. All that has to be strengthened against the enemy. I think the Assyrian refers to what is violent in character in contrast to Babylon, which is more the corrupting element. God may use the violence of man for the chastening of His people. It is severe chastening to be exposed to violence every day and every night, which is what some of our brethren are going through. It is the severe dealings of God, under which we have to humble ourselves. The citadel is really the assembly, viewed as a great divine citadel that stands against all the power of hades. I think we are all praying that there may be a strengthening and building up of what is of God. On the one hand we need to be careful not to allow the flow of anything the enemy can use, and on the other to be concerned with the building up of all that can stand against the enemy, and in His own time God will come in to release His people from pressure.
Rem. Hezekiah made darts and shields in
{420}
abundance, but it was not the darts and shields that brought victory.
C.A.C. They really got the victory through prayer, and it looks as if it came through two men. If only two brothers or two sisters were left to pray for the testimony, it would be carried through. The virgin daughter of Zion is found in those two men. The general state was anything but what it should have been, but an element appears in Hezekiah and Isaiah that was the virgin daughter of Zion, and she laughed at the adversary. The thing is there that God can support. If there is dependence in prayer, it will be supported. He never yet failed to support what He can support. If I am in a condition to be supported, I am sure He will support me. What a beautiful sense Hezekiah had of their superiority. With them an arm of flesh, but God with us; more with us than with them. It is just the truth of Romans, "If God be for us, who against us?" (@Romans 8: 31).
Rem. Sennacherib was a conqueror of hosts: Jehovah is the Lord of hosts.
Ques. What is the reference Sennacherib makes that "Ye shall worship before one altar" (verse 12)?
C.A.C. He did not observe the power of that. Sennacherib had learned in some way that many altars had been destroyed, but he did not know how to distinguish between Jehovah and the idols. All this boastful arrogance of Sennacherib is just the natural expression of the human heart when a man gets power into his hands; and Satan would like the people of God to become a prey of human power.
Rem. It is very encouraging for us. I was enjoying what was said about the daughter of Zion. How much more it is true when numbers cry to God.
C.A.C. I wonder whether we really believe there is more power in this little company of believers here than
{421}
in all the armies and navies of the world. Do we really believe that?
Rem. Some of us get a sense of it at times.
C.A.C. It is good if we do. And God is coming in by preserving not only His saints but His creatures in answer to the prayers of His people. Prayer is not an unfruitful business that the saints are engaged in; it is the most successful business there ever was.
Rem. In @Acts 4: 31 the place was shaken where they were: "When they had prayed, the place in which they were assembled shook".
C.A.C. We ought to look for such manifestation, some evidence now that God is for His saints, and He is with His saints. It is most encouraging; God dealt in one night with the most powerful army of that time, I suppose. It shows how quickly God can dispose of the enemy of the testimony. I believe if the saints were in the good of the present exercises the war would cease more quickly than it would otherwise. I think it is a fine chapter for us just at this juncture. In the end the enemy shall surely be put to shame. "The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly" (@Romans 16: 20) -- think of that! The language of the virgin daughter of Zion is the boasting of faith that God Himself put into the mouths of the saints. The prophet was told to utter these words which are a sublime contrast to the boastful bragging of Sennacherib. There was a spiritual triumph on the part of the daughter of Zion. We may shake and feel our own weakness, but God would have us to know something of this triumph over what is hostile.
Ques. What is meant by the virgin daughter of Zion?
C.A.C. It suggests they are those who have not fallen under the corrupting influence of the world, and it denotes a virgin state that has kept itself in purity from the corrupting influence of the enemy. Well, none of us is
{422}
debarred from that. It is a jubilant sound.
Rem. Hezekiah said, "The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth. Jehovah was purposed to save me. -- And we will play upon my stringed instruments all the days of our life, in the house of Jehovah" (@Isaiah 38: 19, 20).
C.A.C. When Hezekiah came to prove his own personal exercises, he was not quite in this triumph. We all know, I suppose, what it is to face personal exercises that let us down very low. But he came out of those exercises in triumph too. Exercises which are inward are deeper: those that expose the corruption of my flesh are infinitely deeper than anything outward, but we learn God in them. We learn our own nothingness; we are not to be trusted, but God is trustworthy. So all our theology is boiled down to two propositions, that is, God is good and Christ is precious. The people rested themselves on the words of Hezekiah. It is beautiful. We have even better to rest on, the word of God and of the Son of God Himself. It is a safe thing to rest on those words.
{423}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 33
@2 Chronicles 33: 1 - 20
Rem. There is a very pronounced lapse now after the recovery of Hezekiah.
C.A.C. Yes, it seems to show that those who have had special opportunity may turn out very disappointing; but that is not the great lesson of the chapter, is it?
Ques. What is it, perhaps you will tell us?
C.A.C. I think it was intended to show us that the accepted time continues.
Rem. That is very wonderful, for the failure is very terrible that is outlined in this chapter.
C.A.C. Yes, it is very much the present state of the christian profession that is brought before us, but notwithstanding all it is still the well-accepted time. It is a great comfort to bear in our minds that God is not yet sending strong delusions to mankind. He is going to do it and will do it after the assembly is translated. It is impossible for Him to do it today because it is an accepted time, that is, God can vindicate His own name whatever men may do to dishonour that name; and the christian profession has done everything possible against that name. But He will vindicate that name, and whenever any heart will humble itself, He will hearken. At the present time Satan is deceiving men and they are deceiving themselves, but on God's part it is a well-accepted time, a day of salvation, and that is said, not to sinners, but to saints. It is brought out to the Corinthians (@2 Corinthians 6: 2), so Paul beseeches them not to receive the grace of God in vain, on this ground, that is, if they turn to God
{424}
He will hear them. Those words are addressed primarily to Christ Himself, as we all know, and He was the first one to prove it was a well-accepted time, He was always heard when He called upon God.
Rem. Manasseh had a long reign, and God gave him opportunity to repent.
Rem. God is "longsuffering towards you", Peter says (@2 Peter 3: 9).
C.A.C. Yes, addressing saints. If there is anything wrong there is opportunity to repent of it.
Rem. It brings out the greatness of God and His thought to bless, His wonderful forbearance. How great He is in the face of such actions as this, on the part of one who had been brought up in a circle where the ways of God were experienced and known. And it is not a personal thing only, it led all God's people astray and robbed God. Yet God patiently waits in His grace. The captivity was really in view of blessing.
C.A.C. It is an immense thing to get the knowledge of God, is it not? It is by far the greatest blessing that could be thought of to know the Blesser Himself and His name, and He speaks of His name as set for ever in Jerusalem. Manasseh had done all against that name and everything unworthy of that name. Hezekiah had said, "the father to the children shall make known thy truth" (@Isaiah 38: 19); but the depraved condition of the heart of man is such that he always deliberately prefers to have what is not of God. That is, Manasseh was not converted as we should say.
Rem. "The goodness of God leads thee to repentance" (@Romans 2: 4).
C.A.C. Manasseh proved it in a very special way. "Not knowing", it says; man naturally does not know it, he has to be put through a very humbling process to know it.
{425}
Rem. It says God left Hezekiah "to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart" (chapter 32: 31). Manasseh had to learn that lesson.
C.A.C. Ever since the making known of God's name by His Son, the devil has been working to obscure it. There was a wonderful knowledge of God possible to Israel, for Jehovah had made Himself known as a Saviour God, One who had loved them and redeemed them, and brought them to Himself. There was a wonderful disclosure for that time.
Rem. In @Luke 4 the Lord Himself said, "Today this scripture is fulfilled in your ears" (verse 21). It is the day of grace, a divine Person coming near to men and saying, "Today ... is fulfilled in your ears".
Rem. And the Lord closed the book at that point; it was salvation that He brought in. He leaves out "the day of vengeance of our God" (@Isaiah 61: 2).
Rem. That would be another day; we want to take up all there is in this day.
C.A.C. Well, what is the characteristic of this day? The Father's name is made known, His motives are known, and all that was nearest to His heart, all His purposes for those He loves. Satan has come in with darkening influences to obscure that name. Elements of the world have been brought in to obscure, that do not belong to the revelation of God's name at all. On the side of the dispensation all this terrible war is an acting of grace, but on the side of divine government God deals with divine chastisement upon the nations, but even then on the side of the dispensation it is in grace, in order that men may turn to God and learn God's name as it has been made known by His Son.
Rem. And God does not move from that position.
C.A.C. As long as the dispensation lasts, and the Spirit is here, God does not move from that position. He
{426}
is called "the Spirit of truth" (@John 16: 13).
Rem. "Grace and truth subsists through Jesus Christ" (@John 1: 17).
C.A.C. Grace and truth are one thing, and that is why the verb is in the singular. "Grace and truth subsists through Jesus Christ", that is, the truth at the present time is that God is revealed in grace. The Lord introduced that character of things, man able to speak in freedom and liberty to God. That availability began in Christ; no Old Testament prophet or priest had the privilege of speaking to God as Christ did. It is very important for us to see the greatness of these things. The greatest thing of all is God's name revealed by the Son and maintained in the Spirit -- what He is, and His motives and heart. God is seeking the recovery of man, and particularly the recovery of all in the christian profession. To Laodicea, He says, 'I have placed Myself at the door and am knocking'. He is seeking the recovery of an assembly that will not have Him, and yet He stands outside and knocks. It is really an assembly reproof. It is God known in His name, for His name is how He would have men to know Him. God is not the God of a section of men; God is one. I believe God intends us to be encouraged at the possibility of the recovery of anybody; nothing is impossible.
Rem. Even a spiritualist.
C.A.C. Yes. Manasseh was a spiritualist. No man is outside the pale. A brother well known to us had the opportunity of addressing thousands of wounded men, and asked each the question, 'When you were struck down on the battlefield, did you think of God and your soul and eternity'? There was not one out of many thousands who did not say he did. God has not given man up, even if man has given Him up.
We want to keep the spirit of the dispensation.
{427}
Christendom generally has gone back to law. It began in @Acts 16 and the great mass of christians regard themselves under law: 'Incline our hearts to keep this law'. It is hateful to God, it is wickedness. The truth is, we have died to the law. This going back to the law obscures the grace of God, and after all God's great concern is that His name should be known. At the end of Matthew they are to make disciples of all the nations; "Baptising them to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit" (chapter 28: 19). It is marvellous, the greatest thing conceivable, that man should be brought into connection with God in that way, in the fulness of it: the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. God has come out in the fulness of grace in His Son. A divine Person in manhood is the greatest thing, and He laid down His life at the cross that man might be redeemed. And then the Spirit comes into our hearts that we might have the Spirit of sonship. We all need to come to the point that we need God for ourselves. Manasseh really needed God, and then for the first time he began to seek Him. He humbled himself greatly, it says.
Many things come upon us as the result of our own fault, and that is governmental, but then, divine government subserves the designs of His grace. This brings out the availability of God at the end of the dispensation. It was just at the end and they were about to be carried off into captivity, showing God was available for the most departed man. This book has restoration in view, having been written by Ezra. So that the greatest thing God has done for us is that He has brought us back to His name.
Rem. So He has put His name on them for ever.
C.A.C. His name was in Jerusalem only in a typical way; His name is placed now in the assembly.
Rem. "According to thy name, ... so is thy praise" (@Psalm 48: 10). It is an exercise that our praise should be in
{428}
line with that name.
C.A.C. It is very touching that the One who makes known God's name is the One who has taken up the wonderful service of praising His name.
Rem. The praise is equal to the revelation.
C.A.C. It is suitable to God.
Ques. Why did Manasseh build a wall "on the west" (verse 14)?
C.A.C. It is the side that is more likely to be the declining side of things, the east is the rising side, so the west side needs the most strengthening. We are just at the end of the dispensation when things are hastening to their 'sunset'; so there are fortified cities and power to strengthen what is weak.
Rem. "Be watchful, and strengthen the things that remain" (@Revelation 3: 2).
C.A.C. We want to lay ourselves out to strengthen all that is connected with the revealed name. We want to enjoy it and maintain it. Assembly recovery is going on at the present time; it may have gone on a little faster with some than others. And all building is building up in the knowledge of God intelligently and all edification is that, it is the great service in the assembly.
Ques. Why does it mention "both courts of the house of Jehovah" (verse 5)?
C.A.C. I think it shows how Satan would use what is apparently great and elevated -- it is "all the host of heaven" (verse 5) -- what is to the mind of man extremely glorious, to obscure the revelation of God. There are systems of teaching in the world today, but do they impart any true knowledge of God as men desire to know Him? Rationalism and ritualism are two great elements Satan uses. Ritualism appeals to the religious side of man and the other to man's mentality, but neither
{429}
of them brings any knowledge of God's name to us.
Rem. These principles meant the ship went to pieces (@Acts 27: 41).
C.A.C. That is what will happen, the ship will go to pieces. I do not suppose Manasseh had ever read the book of Deuteronomy, or he would have known all these things were positively forbidden by God. And all the things that have darkened God's name are disobedience, all that is contrary to God's name.
Ques. "He reinstated the altar of Jehovah", it says in verse 16. What does that signify?
C.A.C. I think the true character of approach was recovered and the place of approach, and that has been what God has reinstated in these last days, after many centuries when the thought of approach was not known.
Rem. He "sacrificed on it peace-offerings and thank-offerings".
C.A.C. It suggests the restoration of fellowship on a divine basis.

NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 35
@2 Chronicles 35: 16 - 27
Rem. We were remarking of this recovery last week, that not only is attention called to what was written in the law of Moses, but to what was written by David concerning the service of song.
C.A.C. And I suppose it was peculiarly pleasurable to God as the product of His recovering grace and mercy.
Rem. It says, "There was no passover like to that holden in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet". It was a remarkable recovery.
C.A.C. Yes, it is encouraging for us in a day like the present.
Rem. We see the importance of what is written in verse 4, and again in verse 12: "According to the writing of David ... and according to the writing of Solomon his son", and "as it is written in the book of Moses". It emphasises what is written.
C.A.C. This is very important, because what was written gave the mind of God in its completeness, just as we have the ministry of the Lord Himself and of His chosen servants, in which the true character of the present position of the service of God is developed. We could not judge of it by tracing out the history of the church for it never carried it out. The historical church never stood in the truth of the gospel or of the mystery, but God saw to it that it was written. The tendency in the religious world is to go back as far as they can to what the church was at the beginning so that people get taken
{431}
up with antiquity, and they can follow the public history of the church a long way back, but the furthest point is still marked by corruption and departure. So the safe thing is to go back to what is written in the Scriptures.
Rem. The Lord says several times, "It is written".
C.A.C. The great matters of the truth remain in the Scriptures.
Rem. We have the authority of those who wrote, it remains in Scripture today.
C.A.C. So that we can remain on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, and we have a great deal more than Pentecost. So Moses inaugurated the old system but David filled it out. The system of truth and blessing and the knowledge of God was inaugurated at Pentecost, but then Paul's ministry and John's ministry came in after to fill it out, which is something like David's ministry, coming in after.
Rem. The ministry of the twelve apostles gives the foundation, and then Paul fills in the spiritual side.
C.A.C. Yes.
Rem. And the recovery of the truth during the last century has largely hinged on the spiritual appreciation of the Scriptures, the reading of the word.
Rem. In the case of cavillers, it is not the word of man versus man, but the authority of God.
C.A.C. The more simply we hold to that ground the more effective we shall be in testimony, do you not think? And see how the truth of the service of God has been developed during the last hundred and more years, for there was little thought of it for a number of centuries. The thought of the assembly as the place of divine service was revived and much detail came out as to divine service.
Rem. One thinks of the labours of J. N. Darby so that what is written is in a more exact form.
{432}
C.A.C. And I suppose really the precious truth of the death of Christ and all that is involved in it has come out as never before. As to the passover, it is as the death of Christ has been appreciated that the whole truth has come to light, do you not think?
Rem. There is the infinite variety of the types, and those in the appreciation of it can take up the death of the Lord.
C.A.C. Really the passover was the basis of sonship. The thought in God's mind was sonship, and the passover was really the righteous and holy ground on which God could have His son: "Let my son go, that he may serve me" (@Exodus 4: 23). That is, God has the thought of sonship generally, but on the ground of the death of Christ. The old order has been closed up, and the new order brought in, so that saints have been learning that a new order has come in, what it is to be in Christ, and in Christ I have a new status, and that involves sonship and new creation.
Rem. So that we come on the ground of the passover: Mark and Matthew say, "As they were eating" (@Mark 14: 22; @Matthew 26: 20).
C.A.C. The Lord could link all that was in His mind with what they were doing. The passover is the greatest offering, because it is the basis on which all the other offerings were brought. The thought of eating comes in so that persons are formed inwardly by the appropriation of Christ.
Ques. Is there any thought why it goes back to Samuel? Hezekiah's goes back to Solomon, does it not?
C.A.C. It seems to be that every revival is better than the one before it. In Nehemiah it goes back to Joshua.
Rem. In @Nehemiah 8: 17, it is the feast of tabernacles that is brought to mind, the climax of the feasts. Here it is the passover. The priests, the responsible elements, are
{433}
there to maintain the service in its fulness.
C.A.C. As the days grow darker the spiritual light grows brighter.
Rem. The present recovery of the truth brought in the greatness of the Person, the greatness and deity of the Lord, as never before.
C.A.C. Like in this chapter, "the holy ark" is brought back to its place (verse 3). It was somehow taken out of its place, we are not told how. Really, everything has turned on that and we might say the value of the passover depends on the Person.
Ques. Is it significant that this is the last place the ark is spoken of historically in the Old Testament? It is the aspect of it on the last occasion that I know of.
C.A.C. That is very striking. I wondered if God would have us cherish it in that light, having learnt to appreciate its value to God.
Ques. Does it secure for the Lord the place that is truly His on the basis of the passover exercise; that is, His place in glory? It is His place there in Solomon's day. And there is to be the sense that there is no place for any but Christ among the saints, and that is His place in the glory scene.
C.A.C. And everything is measured by who He is.
Ques. Does verse 17 bring us to "let us celebrate the feast" (@1 Corinthians 5: 8)? If all the assembly is endowed with is to be maintained, it must be all on this basis.
Ques. What would you say the passover is for us?
C.A.C. I think you would say it is the application in self-judgment of what we have learnt in Christ and His death, so that the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth characterises the saints. We are to be true to Christ and to His death. What right have we to speak of Christ and of His death unless there is a genuine desire on our part to be in keeping with it? It is true we are only alive
{434}
to God as in Christ Jesus. If this is how we live Godward there must be what corresponds with it in the walk and ways and spirits of the saints. The unleavened bread comes in there, the kind of humanity where there is no puffing up or self-exaltation. Some of us have learnt through a course of many years how even God's truth can puff us up.
Ques. Unless the old man is judged, how could Christ be offered?
C.A.C. The thought of what is priestly and levitical is large in this chapter. It is the service of God taken up spiritually in hearts that truly and only desire that Christ should be magnified before God and before man. In verse 18 the royal and priestly and serving features that the passover secures are seen, that which God delights in. I suppose the idea of Judah is a vessel of praise, and of Israel it is a priestly people, who can be trusted in responsibility.
Ques. What do we learn by the end of Josiah's life? "After all this", it says, and emphasises the glories of what we have been speaking about.
C.A.C. Yes, the end of some of these good kings is very exercising. After experiencing this great favour from God and acting in so much faith himself, there came a time when he could not discern what came out of the mouth of God. We are apt to be lifted up even by divine favour. Paul tells us that having been caught up to paradise would have become an occasion to be exalted above measure if the Lord had not sent him a protection by the thorn for the flesh (@2 Corinthians 12: 7). We are tested sometimes whether we can discern what comes out of the mouth of God. It may come out of the mouth of an ungodly man like Necho.
Rem. It was a defection from the higher line of God and His interests.
{435}
C.A.C. Yes, he mixed himself up in a conflict that did not belong to him.
Rem. It is a word to us today, not to get mixed up in the world's affairs.
C.A.C. No, we have not been entrusted with that responsibility; we have quite enough to attend to in minding our own business. It is important not to get engrossed with what is going on around us, though our heart aches as we see the distress and miseries of humanity, enough to break anybody's heart. We cannot be too tender-hearted over the sorrows of men, but we must not be drawn into the current of what is going on. If we are outside of it we can help in the matter. You would not like to discuss the war with a man of the world, would you? You would be likely to come down to his level. I have felt the need of wisdom lately more than ever for there are such opportunities, people are so ready to speak. Have we the word of wisdom, for we may easily stumble people?
What Necho said was from the mind of God. If Josiah had been in a spiritual condition he would have discerned it, but he fell in the conflict in which he had no business to be involved. It does not mean that his course was bad. It was a subject of great lamentation. It is interesting that the book of Lamentations was written because of the great sorrow Jeremiah had over the fall of Josiah. It gives a sweet touch to the book of Lamentations, does it not? It is really the breathings of the Spirit of Christ over the failure of a beloved servant of God at the close of his days. These things make me tremble, because I am getting on towards that point myself.
Rem. The interests of God would preserve us.
C.A.C. Yes, if we are absorbed in the interests and service of the house we shall be preserved, and I do not
{436}
know that anything else will preserve us. It shows that if we have much light which we cherish, we must go on with it; we must not let anything divert us, or we and the service will suffer.
Rem. In the Lord and in the Spirit there is adequate to help us to fulfil our responsibility, if we are near to Him.
Ques. I have wondered why the feast of tabernacles does not follow here?
C.A.C. The feast of tabernacles would show how God has harvested all His great thoughts in Christ glorified, and it is in that connection the Spirit is given. J.B.S. said, 'If we were occupied with Christ in glory, we should walk like Him down here'.
Ques. In @James 1: 5 and @James 3: 15, 17, these features which were seen in the Lord are open to each one of us, are they not?
Rem. The last mention of the ark in the New Testament is as seen in heaven (@Revelation 11) and would suggest Christ in glory.
C.A.C. Very good.
{437}
NOTES OF A READING @2 CHRONICLES 36
@2 Chronicles 36: 1 - 23
C.A.C. I suppose the state of things here is the result of the people not receiving the gain of the great revival of Josiah's day. The book of the law had been received and produced much exercise in the king and others, resulting in a great adjustment of things and a revival of the service of God. But it soon came to light that those who had outwardly participated in the results of that revival were not inwardly held by it.
Ques. Is there any parallel on this line to the assembly?
C.A.C. It raises the question whether we have really profited by the great revival that has taken place during these last days. The Scriptures being extant to us is a very great matter in the sight of God. We do not think much of the fact that we all have bibles, but it is an immense thing, a thing of which our brethren knew nothing for many centuries. And then not only was the book of the law restored, but there was a living ministry through the prophets. A good many of them had finished their course but Jeremiah was still ministering the prophetic word from the mouth of Jehovah.
Rem. There was a disregard of all these things, and if what is of God is disregarded we are sure to fall in some way or other under what is of man.
C.A.C. King Jehoiakim was a very solemn contrast to his father. His father trembled at the word of God, but he himself was prepared to disregard the book of the Lord and the prophetic word, and burn it with fire. I think,
{438}
too, we find in the prophets the real state of the people exposed. Even when there was outward revival and the restoration of the house and its service, the state of the people was dreadful; it is exposed in the prophets.
Rem. So that what is important is not a fair outward order, but that there should be a work deep down in the people, a state commensurate with what was outward.
C.A.C. That is what I was thinking. In Jeremiah and Baruch we see a remnant holding what was of God, preserved in heart and spirit from what was in the surrounding country, and it is a very enviable spirit, is it not? We should all beware of being carried by what is only external. We are only really carried along by God in our spirits. Does agonising in prayer mark us? It is a time of departure and that calls for agonising in prayer, not merely praying.
Rem. We are affected by all that is around us. There must be what is individual and real and vital with us, to stand.
C.A.C. While our associations are of very great importance, our personal spiritual condition is more important still. But we have the privilege of personal nearness to the Lord just in regard of the very conditions in which we are found. We should all be encouraged by that.
Rem. In Daniel features come to light in keeping with what you are saying.
C.A.C. Evidently Daniel had paid attention to the prophetic word of Jeremiah. Oh! these men are a great example for us in these days.
Ques. What have we to learn from the two captivities, one in Egypt and then a second in Babylon?
C.A.C. I think God brings His discipline and governmental ways upon us in stages, having in mind that repentance might be brought about. It is like the stages
{439}
of judgment in Revelation, the series of trumpets and bowls, all in a view of repentance, and they become intensified. And they will increase in severity, having repentance in view, that we may judge all He judges and come into line with all He brings in in Christ (in Cyrus typically). God falls back on His own sovereignty, which is what He is doing largely today, and He is making a selection of certain persons (not better than others) in view of His own testimony, but for His own name's sake. He has passed by great ones in the christian profession and taken up nobodies like ourselves.
Rem. It shows how God carries things through, He selects persons for this, and if they fail in it, He brings in His judgment, all in view of carrying things through.
C.A.C. Yes.
Rem. It is written for our encouragement that however dark the day there is something going through.
C.A.C. Yes, that is what we have been thinking in reading this book, written by Ezra afterwards; so that recovery is made prominent in the book and we want to be in it.
Ques. At the end of Jehoiakim's history, it speaks of what was found in him. Is that how God takes account of him?
C.A.C. In fact very little was found in him for God, but it was taken account of.
Rem. The last two verses of the chapter show the way God has His reserves as against a great dark background. It is stimulating.
Ques. One of the points in Jeremiah is that there should be subjection to Jehovah. Is it not a very important matter?
C.A.C. I am sure it is.
Rem. They were to pray for the city where they were captives.
{440}
C.A.C. God can do anything with a subject vessel.
Rem. Jeremiah was taken to Egypt.
C.A.C. He had to learn subjection. Sometimes it is right to submit to what comes upon us, even if we do not like it.
Ques. We have to accept captivity conditions sometimes. Is salvation found in accepting? Are submission and subjection two things we have to learn?
C.A.C. Yes, I think they are important things.
Rem. The word of God, and the mouth of Jeremiah in this, makes it evident that God makes His voice heard.
C.A.C. So we are tested whether we can discern God speaking. It was obvious in Jeremiah, but not so with Necho.
Rem. If we are arrested on a course, it is well to ask ourselves why.
C.A.C. God may use an unconverted man to check me. Am I spiritual enough to discern it is God's voice? What is serious in this chapter is that the vessels are carried away; even the holy things fall under the power of the world.
Ques. What would answer to the vessels and the holy things?
C.A.C. Well, I suppose from this point of view things in themselves very precious, and in themselves intended to contribute to the glory of God, may be made part of a human system for the glory of man.
Ques. Has that been done to many of our brethren?
C.A.C. And the system is accredited, as it were, by their presence.
Rem. In @Isaiah 22:24 all the vessels hang on Christ for divine pleasure.
C.A.C. The government of God is to be submitted to under all circumstances, though it may appear sometimes that the vessels of God are given over to idolatrous
{441}
purposes.
Ques. To what would the breaking down of the wall of Jerusalem refer?
C.A.C. That is what the enemy would always like to do. It was the work of Nehemiah to set it up again. It represents the important principles of fellowship, which are the great protection of the house of God. Satan is always ready to break them down, so as to mix up what is of God with what is of man.
Ques. What is keeping sabbath? "All the days of its desolation it kept sabbath, to fulfil seventy years" (verse 21).
C.A.C. I suppose the people had not observed the sabbatical year from about the time of Solomon, so that seventy sabbatical years had been missed and they had to wait to make up the sabbatical years, showing that while things may be right outwardly, what is of God may be neglected. If you reckon it back it will come to about Solomon's reign.
Rem. @Joel 2: 25 speaks of "the years that the locust hath eaten".
C.A.C. I hardly think the locusts would have had anything if the sabbatical year had been kept. It is most touching to see the tenderness and fidelity of divine love. God makes a long day of it, as it were. Christendom is not given up yet, but is a subject of God's solicitude and divine care. He stands at the door and knocks. His great solicitude and care is that man might have to do with divine Persons.
Rem. As well as what was taken from the house, there was the loss of the treasures also of the king and his princes.
C.A.C. If we do not give to the Lord what is due to Him, we shall lose what is ours.
Rem. The last part of verse 15 gives the longsuffering of God in view of blessing for His people, and of what is
{442}
for His glory: two things God always has before Him.
C.A.C. Yes.
