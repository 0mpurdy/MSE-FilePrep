NOTES OF READINGS ON THE GOSPEL OF JOHN
CHAPTER 1
F.E.R. I am rather inclined to think "The Word" was a recognised appellative as applied to Christ. When the apostle speaks thus of that Person, it was in a way known and recognised by Christians. This gospel was written late.
I suppose the reference to "eye-witnesses" in @Luke 1: 2 would refer more to miracles, and that sort of thing. It is "eye-witnesses *of*". The Word was His personal name. I think it helps in the understanding of this gospel to see that John, speaking of "The Word", speaks of a thought that was current among Christians -- known among them.
If you talk about the testimony of God -- Christ Himself is the testimony; not simply certain facts, but Christ Himself is the testimony from John's point of view. Death and resurrection are certain facts, and they form a testimony in a certain way, but in John, Christ Himself is the testimony. These things are all parts of the testimony.
Ques. Would you regard the title as an adaptation of a thought that was in man's mind?
F.E.R. Well, that is, after all, a matter of small moment to us. If it comes to that, all words are taken up in man's literature, and no doubt the thought may have been familiar to men. The thing is, Christ Himself is the testimony -- *He is "The Word*".
Ques. Is it right to say, "The eternal Word"?
F.E.R. Scripture does not so speak. The expression is used here in connection with His presentation in manhood. It is He who is "The Word" who was "in the beginning".
{2}
Ques. What is the meaning of "in the beginning" here?
F.E.R. It carries you back to the farthest point of time. No human mind can take in a period previous to "the beginning" in John. "All things received being" by that Person, and "without him not one thing received being which has received being". The full thought in the title "The Word" belongs to Him as become flesh. "The Word became flesh, and dwelt among us", and afterwards we have, "We have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father". He came out as the testimony of God -- all the thought and heart of God find their expression in Him. Resurrection may witness God's *power*, but it would not, in that way, be the expression of His *love*. His giving His only-begotten Son is the witness of His love. No one who was not all He is said to be in these verses could be the expression of God.
Ques. What is the difference between "the beginning" here and in the epistle?
F.E.R. "From the beginning" in the epistle is "from the outset". You remember it says, "The devil sinneth from the beginning" -- that is, from the outset of sin. It is the beginning of the thing spoken of to which the writer refers. In the epistle John is speaking of Christianity, and so he speaks of what was from the outset of that. Christ was the beginning of Christianity from John's point of view -- all that preceded that was completely ignored. It is peculiar to John.
Ques. I suppose that Christianity does not properly begin until resurrection and ascension?
F.E.R. It is one feature of John's gospel that he speaks of what Christ brings in -- he carries you back, even in the epistle, to what, in a certain sense, was from the very beginning of Christ. It connects itself
{3}
with the peculiar line of John's testimony -- it presents Christ coming in after a completely new order.
Rem. The "corn of wheat" which fell into the ground and died, that it might not abide alone.
F.E.R. Yes; it is all after that kind.
Rem. John speaks of Christ because failure had come in.
F.E.R. Yes. The church may fail, but Christ can never fail. It is a great point that there is no failure about Christ, and all this was written when everything was broken down. It is supposed to be the last book written in the New Testament. John is altogether different from every other gospel. What I mean is this -- he brings to light what is in the Godhead. No other gospel does that.
Ques. I suppose you would say there is abundant proof in the others of His being God's Son come down here?
F.E.R. Oh, yes. But there is no other gospel which takes quite the ground of His being the Son here to reveal the Father -- that is not the line which they pursue. Matthew, for instance, presents Him as men knew Him here on earth, but John gives you what lies behind -- the relationships of divine persons -- if I might say so, the inner life of the Godhead. You do not get that developed in any other gospel. Then, in the latter part of this gospel, you get the coming of the Holy Spirit; it is the truth as to the Godhead which is brought out in John, which is totally different, in that way, from any other gospel.
Ques. What do you understand by the "Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father"?
F.E.R. The Father is the source of all -- the source of divine counsels, but then the Son comes to carry those counsels into effect. The Son and the Spirit both come forth from the Father in that way. The Holy Spirit came on that line, in connection with the counsels of the Father. Then, too, you find that the
{4}
Son is the centre of those counsels; the Spirit is the bond, if I may so speak, between the Father and the Son. The Father and the Son are one in the unity of the Spirit.
Ques. The Spirit is a distinct Person in the Godhead?
F.E.R. Yes, of course. It is in the same way that the Spirit is the bond that binds all Christians together. The Father and the Son are One, but they must be One in the unity of the Spirit -- you cannot leave the Spirit out -- it is the Spirit of the Father, but then He is spoken of too as the Spirit of Christ.
Ques. Do you take "The Word" to be that which expresses God?
F.E.R. Yes. It is that in which God is expressed -- you get all the heart of God coming out. A prophet could not make known to you the heart of God; he might make known a great deal about God, but there could be no testimony like the testimony of a divine Person. The Lord said, "We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen". A prophet very often did not know at all what he was speaking about. Christ was altogether what He said He was. In Him there was One down here in this world who could tell you what was in the heart of God. It is most wonderful.
If you want to get all about the divine nature, and love, you have to go to John for it. He presents to you the One in whom it was all manifested. No one but Himself was equal to the manifestation of it. I do not see how you could have love presented except in a *Person*. You could not get at the reality of it except in a *Person*. Think of a Man being here -- there was a Man here -- the exact expression of God, and who knew all that was in the heart of God. What a moment for earth!
Then you get, "In him was life, and the life was the light of men" (verse 4). All things came into
{5}
existence by Him, and in Him was *life*. I think "life", as here, involves the power to quicken, it is a divine Person who could make others alive. You could not speak of life being in a *creature*, because he is simply made alive by an act of power. You are quickened, but it can only be said of a divine Person that life was "*in him*". "The life was the light of men". "He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life". When man saw this "life", he really saw what the life of God was, that is, love; love is properly the life of God. I have no doubt that Christ was as strange to man as man was strange to Him. If you could conceive such a thing, I really think that the Lord must have been surprised at the motives which actuated man -- the way he sets to work to gratify himself, and to make himself happy here. It must all have been so strange in His sight to see man pursuing happiness, as he thought, and yet to know that it was not that, but just the opposite. We too ought to learn to look at things morally, and not as they appear. It must have been a strange path for the Lord through this world; things must have looked strange to Him here, and I have no doubt He appeared equally strange to them. The Christian ought to be as strange to the world as Christ was. You get the principle in the verse, "The spiritual man discerns all things, yet he himself is discerned of no man".
Rem. Selfishness cannot understand love, and love cannot understand selfishness.
F.E.R. Still, the life was the light of men; it came into the world as the light of men, although, I quite own, it needed a work of God for them to receive the light, but the life was the light.
Ques. How does this verse fit in with what we have in @John 5: 26, "As the Father has life in himself, so he has given to the Son also to have life in himself"?
F.E.R. You get what is proper to divine Persons
{6}
spoken of here, but in @John 5 it is developing what was between the Father and Himself as a Man down here -- that which He takes up as "given" to Him, all that was His as Man. When you look at that Person abstractly, He has life in Himself; but in the other case, viewed as in His ministry here on earth, He received it from the Father.
Ques. The "last Adam, a life-giving Spirit"?
F.E.R. Well, He became that -- He was made that. Until resurrection He could not give life to men. It was in resurrection that He is spoken of as the "last Adam". He cannot be a "life-giving Spirit" until resurrection, until the judgment of God had been met. As a matter of fact, in @John 5 He is speaking of Himself all through as the "last Adam", but the "last Adam" is the Son of God.
I think the idea in verse 4 is that there was no other light for man -- He was the only light for man. "The life was the light of men". There is no record of any quickening here. "The darkness comprehended it not"; it was impenetrable darkness, even as regards divine light. Man was not capable of taking in the light, it just proved his perfect incapability. It is like those wonderful rays we hear of now, that can penetrate solid bodies. They can penetrate to the bone, but they cannot make alive. They can discover the bit of dead bone, if it is there, but they cannot make it alive. They leave the dead bone just what it was before.
Rem. It brings the two things very markedly together -- life and light.
F.E.R. It is as plain to me as daylight, because, as far as man is concerned, he cannot live if God does not reveal Himself. The fact of man's living depends on God revealing Himself. Life must depend upon light.
I do not suppose Adam wanted much in the way of "light". He, as far as I can understand his experience,
{7}
knew God in everything -- every created thing was to him an evidence of the goodness and beneficence of God, and before he fell, I suppose he was filled with gratitude and thankfulness. He could have known nothing about the righteousness of God, or the holiness, or love, of God, although everything witnessed to the goodness of God. It was in that that Adam lived. Now we, in God's ways, know a very great deal about God; we know His righteousness and His holiness and His love. All these things have come out to us now as "light", and in that light we live. "The Son of God has come ... that we should know him that is true".
Rem. And in that way He undoes the work of the devil.
F.E.R. Yes. You want light to enlighten you, but how are you going to live, or where? God begins a work in you, but that is not life in the true sense of it. There must be a work of God *in* you, but living is quite a different idea in Scripture. We commonly speak of a man having "life", but life really is living in certain relationships -- that is really begun when the heart has appreciated the light of God. There is, of course, a starting-point, and that is when God is known. When there is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, we arrive at the starting-point of life. What makes me say that is this -- "The letter kills, but the Spirit quickens", @2 Corinthians 3: 6. Then a little later in the chapter you have, "Now the Lord is the Spirit". When your soul apprehends the Lord in resurrection, you have got hold of the quickening Spirit.
Rem. That is, across the Red Sea.
F.E.R. Yes, exactly, that is just it. Now, until that point is reached, there is no deliverance from the judgment of death; but when you come across the Red Sea, and apprehend the Lord *risen*, you apprehend *life* -- "the Spirit makes alive". You know the life of God -- you get an insight into life.
{8}
Ques. Is that the beginning of light as well as life?
F.E.R. Not exactly. The first light that comes in is as to the blood; a person gets a sense of divine righteousness, and of being under judgment; but if you are going to live to God, *you must get outside the flesh*. You are landed outside the flesh when you apprehend the Lord Jesus Christ as outside the flesh. Your *faith* has taken you outside the range of flesh. The cleverest man cannot enter into the idea of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is impossible -- naturally man cannot go beyond the flesh.
As a matter of fact, people do not know what faith is. They give you an illustration of it, a story something like this: "You have heard there is such a place as, say, Canton. You have received it upon trustworthy authority, and you believe it. Well, that is faith". And people want you to believe that that is faith. There is not a bit of faith in it! Why, I could go and verify that statement to-morrow if I had ways and means. Now, the thing is, *faith* is what you cannot verify, but you take it upon the testimony of God. Before God comes out in a public way, I accept His testimony, and that is the link between my soul and God. "The just shall live by faith". "Faith is ... the evidence of things not seen". The heart is interested in that scene -- it is with the *heart* you believe. How do you know that God raised Christ from the dead? You say you are sure of it, you know it upon God's testimony -- it is God's testimony that enables you to know Him risen from the dead. I do not think that, even with the disciples, it was simply upon the testimony of their eyesight that they believed in the resurrection. I believe they accepted the testimony of God's word -- the testimony of the scripture. Man has to learn to accept God's testimony. How could you be happy through eternity if you could not trust God's word? That is a very much greater thing that just believing the historical facts.
{9}
I feel sure that the resurrection is the true test of faith. The human mind can take in *death* in a certain way -- it is familiar with that -- but it cannot take in resurrection. God had before Him in the cross a true demonstration of man's state and place, and that is why the apostle pressed so much the testimony of the cross; but you cannot believe in the cross unless you believe in the resurrection. The resurrection is the great proof that the One who died on that cross was the Son of God.
You see, if there is to be universal blessing, God must come in and establish a link between man's soul and Himself. To introduce blessings into this world, to heal ills, and all that sort of thing, would not be sufficient. He must have a link established between Himself and the heart of man. What is to accomplish this? Why, nothing but His word -- making Himself known, and getting a place in the heart of man.
Ques. Would not that produce repentance?
F.E.R. In one sense it would -- "The goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance". The principle was the same with Israel: "The word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart". The word is the link between them and God. It was the same with Abraham -- "he believed God". If God sends light into the world, man's heart is tested by it -- the gospel comes in, a great testing process, in order to bring to light the elect of God. It is like the woman in the parable that lighted the candle in order to find the lost piece of silver. It is the light of God testing every man. Some reject and some receive, but the great purpose of the gospel is to bring to light the elect of God.
Returning to the chapter, it is noticeable that you do not get any sort of detail here, either in regard to the Lord or to John the Baptist. John is simply introduced as "a man sent from God". We have nothing of the connection between him and what
{10}
preceded. Luke presents this -- in Luke we get his parentage and all the details of his birth, but in the gospel of John everything is viewed quite abstractly. He says, "There was a man sent from God.... He came for witness", a testimony. So, too, in speaking of the Lord, he introduces Him abruptly, simply as "The Word".
Ques. I suppose that in Matthew, where you get John preaching the kingdom, it was what a Jew would naturally expect?
F.E.R. Quite so. But here he comes to bear witness to something which was entirely fresh. He comes to "witness concerning the light, that all might believe through him". That was the bearing of his testimony.
Ques. It is not, of course, that men coming into the world were enlightened?
F.E.R. Oh, no; *it*, that is, the true Light, "coming into the world, lightens every man". There was the complete exposure of man, the light made manifest every man, it found man out. Not only did it reveal God to them, but He was revealed really according to the truth of man's condition. The Light came in revealing God, but, at the same time, exposing man. Men did not know their need of forgiveness any more than they do now. What they really needed was something deeper, even *new birth*. What people prefer is to be told what they ought to do, provided, of course, it is not too irksome; but the Light coming in exposed man's *state*. It was so in @John 8, but those who were exposed took care to get out of the Light -- they all went out.
It is a revelation of God to man, suited to his state. If God were revealed in judgment, it would not be *light*; there would have been no light for the woman in @John 8 if God had come out in the way of *legislation*. It is what God is in relation to man, in suitability to
{11}
man. Nothing is more important than to see the way in which men were exposed in the presence of Christ. If the Lord comes in in the way of forgiveness, then it proves that man needs forgiveness. If He comes in to raise man from the dead, then it proves this much -- that man is under death. If He heals man of leprosy, well, man is morally leprous. The Light coming into the world really proved what the state of man was, and it proved him to be in darkness. "The light appears in darkness, and the darkness apprehended it not".
The Lord never did anything but what was really necessary for the relief of man. I do not think there was any superfluity in that way; the secret of all that He did was to make God known, but it was all in relation to the necessity of man. For instance, He would not call fire down from heaven, neither would He command the stones to become bread. Such things were not called forth by the condition of man. There may be, no doubt, an occasional exception, such as the cursing of the fig tree, but that is quite understandable. There was a necessity for the fig tree to be removed out of the way.
There is nothing more wonderful than the way of the Lord down here in the world. There is one verse which expresses it exactly -- "He went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him". It is all summed up in that verse.
Ques. Does "light" carry the thought of blessing as well as exposure?
F.E.R. "Light" is the revelation of God, and that, of course, *is* blessing. If the light comes out, God reveals Himself according to man's need. It is not a legislator that man wants, but One who can make Himself known, as God has done, according to the truth of man's condition; and the fact is that man, on his side, has to accept the exposure. The very
{12}
fact of its being *light* must needs expose you. God does not accommodate Himself to man's condition -- He exposes it, and if man accepts that, he gets blessed; but if, on the other hand, he refuses the light, it proves that he does not accept the exposure.
Ques. You would say that light was a necessity for man's blessing?
F.E.R. How else is man to know God? I cannot conceive how a man is to be made acquainted with God if He does not make Himself known, and that is light. If there had never been light, we should be just like the poor degraded people of Central Africa or India -- shut up in darkness. It is pretty certain that the moral atmosphere of Greece or Rome was not much better than that of Africa or India.
Ques. What was the necessity for a witness to the light?
F.E.R. When God comes in with a testimony to man, He takes care to bring it within the cognisance of man. He orders it so that it may be within man's cognisance, and in that way He does accommodate Himself to man. John came and pointed to the Christ, so that He should be, in that way, brought effectively within the knowledge of man. It increased man's responsibility, but it is the divine way. God takes good care that if He addressed a testimony to man, it should be within man's full cognisance. That is the force of the expression in verse 31, "That he might be manifested to Israel, therefore have I come baptising with water". People have not, I am sure, apprehended the force of it.
It would be a very interesting study, especially in this gospel of John, to trace in what way people were exposed by the light. There were very many cases in which people were brought into the light, and exposed by it. Take Nicodemus, for instance, he was brought into, and exposed by, the light, and virtually it put him into the same position as the woman at Sychar's
{13}
well. Man would not have thought of their equality, but, as a matter of fact, directly they get into the presence of the Lord, they are both found to be in the same boat. Nicodemus could no more understand the kingdom of God than the woman. The woman, really, was quicker to take in the light than Nicodemus was -- "Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?" You might take up everybody you find in John's gospel -- Nathanael, Nicodemus, the woman at the well, the blind man, and the rest -- they are a curious company, but you could put them into the same boat.
Ques. They come out in different colours, I suppose?
F.E.R. No, I do not think so -- they are all of one colour. They are totally unable to apprehend the kingdom of God. Nathanael -- perhaps the best of them all -- said, in answer to Philip's testimony, "Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?" This was right, so far as it went, for "good" can only come out of heaven, but the thought in Nathanael's mind was merely contrasting Nazareth -- outside the pale, as he thought, of religious privilege -- with Jerusalem, which, according to his reckoning, was the centre of everything for God here upon the earth. It only proved what man's state really was.
In regard to the gospel of John generally, it does not deal with the question of man's responsibility, but almost exclusively with man's *state* and the way it is met. No doubt that is why the question of new birth is brought in. It is John alone who gives us the truth as to the new birth, just because he takes up the question of *state*. You see, the Lord does not say to a poor Gentile, "Ye must be born again", neither does He say it to an ignorant Jew, but it is to a teacher of Israel. If a *teacher* of Israel needed to be born again, then most assuredly it is a necessity for a poor Gentile. If a man of the very best type needs it, then
{14}
certainly it must be a necessity for one of the very worst. The light "coming into the world, sheds its light upon every man". Coming into the world, every man is exposed by it.
It is a great thing to apprehend how thoroughly God does His work. All has come out, the whole state of man has been completely exposed. See how man exposes himself in this gospel with regard to Christ! We get the effect of the light coming in, it just proves man's utter incapability to receive it, and his insensibility to what is good. Man was completely out of touch with God. What an awful thing! God created the world, and then He came into the world, and man does not know Him! "He came to his own, and his own received him not". It is exactly the same, in principle, in the world as it is today. It is a very terrible testimony to come out in a couple of verses, "His own" refers, of course, to the Jews, and "the world" to everybody.
"As many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God" (verse 12), refers to what was the effect of the light being here; it is a summary, an epitome. These verses give you, in a short and concise way, the effect of its being here. "As many as received him" received him as the Light of the world, I think. Now we receive the testimony of God, but not quite in the same sense. We believe in the Son of God on the testimony of the Holy Spirit, but in the gospel it is more that they believed on Him as the Light of the world. We believe in Christ *at the right hand of God*, and not as the Light of the world *here*. We believe that the Son of God *has* come. The rejection of Christ by the world has changed the whole position of everything. If there is to be anything of blessing for man now, it must be outside of this world -- it cannot be in connection with the world which has rejected Christ. The testimony of God addresses itself to every one in the world, but really
{15}
with a view to taking them out of the world. You get a figure of it in baptism.
There are a vast number of things which God owned, in a certain way, but which now He can no longer recognise. God owned the flesh, for instance, to a large extent until Christ was rejected, and worldly motives, and that sort of thing, but He cannot sanction anything of that sort now. Even in what you get in these words, "But as many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God", He gave them a place outside this world; they belonged to God, and not to the world. It was not a natural place for them at all, but He gave them the title to take it.
Ques. Is not that what the blind man got in chapter 9?
F.E.R. Yes. As has been often said, in chapter 8 they refuse His word, and in chapter 9 they would not have His work. They try to stone Him in chapter 8, and in chapter 9 they cast out the blind man, and it is then that God meets him.
Ques. "Power" has the sense of "authority", has it not?
F.E.R. Yes -- title, or authority. I think it refers to chapter 20, "Go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God". It was the declaration of the Father's name, as the title of relationship; it was then that He gave them title to become the children of God when redemption was accomplished. While He was with them, they had no authority to take the place of children -- He gave it to them in the declaration of the Father's name. A child of God does not belong to the first man, and until the first man was ended he could not be put into that place. If otherwise, it would have involved putting something on to the first man, which was an impossibility.
The point is to see that everything depends upon Christ's taking up the place of "last Adam" in
{16}
subsisting righteousness. He is the living Head, and under Him all will come out according to God. When He took that place before God in subsisting righteousness, it was then that God was completely glorified. He had the Man before Him. But then another thing comes out, the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. It was true there was only one Man before God, but then that One was a life-giving Spirit. He could quicken, and so you may have any number of men there. That is the meaning of what the Lord did in @John 20. He was "last Adam", and He breathed on them and said, "Receive ye Holy Spirit". The first man dragged his posterity down with him under death, and he had no power to quicken; but Christ is a life-giving Spirit.
Ques. He is that as a divine Person?
F.E.R. Yes; and that is a point of the very last moment; He could not quicken unless He was a divine Person.
Ques. What do you mean by "subsisting righteousness"?
F.E.R. It is that there is nothing left to be effected -- not like the high priest who had to go in year by year with the blood of others. This is not the case with Christ, who accomplished eternal redemption. The question of sin can never be raised again, because in Him there is subsisting righteousness, the value of which can in no wise be diminished. He is the Head in subsisting righteousness; the old thing is gone, and the righteousness of God is met, and He is the Witness to it. But then He takes up the position of last Adam, a life-giving Spirit, the Head of every man, and He takes up that place in subsisting righteousness, it is eternally established. "He was delivered for our offences", but then He was also "raised again for our justification". The question of sin is settled, because the question of righteousness is settled. Christ is our righteousness. It is not simply that we are
{17}
purged. We are that, but more than that, we are before God in Christ our righteousness. "He has obtained eternal redemption for us". The great point, to my mind, is that, in that position, He is a life-giving Spirit. It is only a question now as to whom He will give it, and all is done in perfect accordance with the Father. It is to whom the Father wills, but the One who did the work is the One who also has the right to quicken. It is, "as the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself", and "as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them, even so the Son quickeneth whom he will".
All this shows how perfect the recovery has been. The first man dragged his posterity through the mire, but when Christ quickens, it is after His own order. It is not in the order that failed, but it is a new Man. I believe that nothing has been more prejudicial than the talk about "nature". It is a new man -- a man after a new order, with a whole system of affections suited to him.
What is Christ's mother to Him now? A saint, of course, but all that she was to Him has gone. Mary Magdalene is just as much to Him as His mother. That shows at once the difference between what ends and what subsists. Many seem incapable of taking in the thought of the new order, but, for all that, there is no trace of the old line left. He confided His mother to John -- that line is closed. At the same time, when He comes in resurrection, you do not find His affection for His disciples one whit abated. His affection for Mary Magdalene was just the same. All the natural is gone, but all that is divine remains, and will last for ever. You hear nothing about His natural kindred after His resurrection.
Ques. These things are not yet in actuality?
F.E.R. We are formed in them in the divine nature. It seems to me like a dissolving view -- another
{18}
view is coming on the sheet while the old is passing off. The day will come when the old will be completely gone, and there will be nothing seen but the new.
Rem. At present there is a mixed condition of things.
F.E.R. The new is obscured by the old, but no doubt Scripture is right, which indicates that as long as you are in the scene of God's institutions, you are not to make light of them. As a man down here I have my part in them. In the Christian circle, as in Christ, there is neither male nor female; neither is there Jew nor Greek, and I come out of my natural relationships for the time. There is a new system and framework of affections, the start and power of which lie in the divine nature. We are "born of God", not by the will of man, or of the flesh, but of God. It is the divine nature. "Born of God" carries the thought of being partakers of His nature; "born again" is by the Spirit, it is of that character. "Born of God" is what is properly descriptive of the Christian. You could hardly consider a cry of helplessness as properly Christian.
The fact of a man having "blue blood" in his veins does not avail much in divine things, for you are not born of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, but of God. It might give a certain amount of refinement and that sort of thing, although it is often the case that the highest born are the most worldly and offensive.
Ques. Why does it say, "To them gave he the right to be children of God" if they did not reach it until @John 20?
F.E.R. Well, it is only the statement of the fact, it is not historic. Those who received Him were "born ... of God".
What we see here in connection with John the Baptist is that he takes no place, he disclaims being
{19}
the Christ, or Elias, or "that prophet", but speaks of himself merely as a "voice". He was no more than a voice. "I baptise with water", but the Christ was preferred before him, for He was before him. You can scarcely take a less place than that of being but a "voice".
Ques. What would you say was the idea in their minds in asking him whether he was the prophet, or Elias?
F.E.R. They thought he was making himself a rallying-point. Baptism was the end of an old order, and they thought he was making himself the rallying-point for the new departure. If he was neither the Christ, nor Elias, nor that prophet, he was scarcely entitled to take up such a position.
Ques. Baptism would mean the ending of the old state?
F.E.R. Yes; and then you must have some kind of rallying-point.
Ques. What is the distinctive character of John's testimony, would you say?
F.E.R. Well, his testimony here is negative. He himself is nothing -- merely a voice. He was making straight the paths of the Lord. When they asked him who he was, he "confessed and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ". It just confirms what was said before, "There was a man sent from God" who was not the light, but was sent to bear witness concerning the light.
Ques. Did he baptise them to the One who was coming?
F.E.R. Yes. His baptism was in view of the coming Messiah. John baptised to One who was coming, and the disciples to One who was actually present, but both had the same moral force.
Ques. Repentance?
F.E.R. Yes. The principle which comes out in baptism is dissociation, cleansing. You are cleansed
{20}
from associations in which you have been before. "Save yourselves from this untoward generation". Then they were baptised to answer to that. It appears to me that it is what God claims down here. There is no virtue in it -- nothing communicated in it -- but it has its value as *cleansing*. "The like figure whereunto, baptism, doth also now save us". Then, too, "Arise ... and wash away thy sins". I think the force of "Save yourselves" is -- cleanse yourselves from them.
Rem. Cut your connection.
F.E.R. Just so. Now suppose a Jew or a Jewess in the present day were to be baptised, that would mean a very great deal to them. In all probability it would expose them to bitter persecution. They would be despised by all their relatives. What is involved in baptism is dissociation -- and it includes even dissociation from oneself. John refuses all place, and even *name*. He was a "voice" and nothing more. The Lord speaks of him as the greatest of the prophets, but he himself takes the simple place in which Scripture puts him, that is, "to bear witness of the light". If he had not taken that place, he would have nullified his mission, he would himself have become a gathering-point. He testifies to the Lord in new characters and aspects -- "Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him", he testifies to that, and then he says, "This is the Son of God". He first of all introduces Him as the Lamb of God, and adds, "This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me". It is not that John is speaking from any knowledge that he might have had of Christ naturally, but as any true Jew might have had knowledge of Him. All through the passage He is spoken of as entirely outside the natural thoughts of men -- of the Jew. He comes to "take away the sin of the world" -- not of the Jew simply, but of the world. Then, too, He baptises with the Holy Spirit, and He
{21}
who does that is the Son of God. It is a great expression that -- He "takes away the sin of the world". I think the first part of the expression -- "Behold the Lamb of God" -- is sacrificial, but "takes away the sin of the world" is not so, as I understand it. Of course, had there been no sacrifice, the gravity of sin would not have been known, and on the other hand, if the sin of the world had been taken away without sacrifice, it would have looked as if God condoned the sin; but He takes away the sin of the world really by revealing God. If He brings God into the world, it must take away the sin of the world -- the very fact of God coming in breaks the whole thing down. Sin all depends upon God *not* being there. The existence of sin depends upon that, but if God comes in, then sin cannot be there. That is true of ourselves individually -- sin is really taken away by God being revealed to us. "For this purpose the Son of God was manifested". The manifestation of God, the light of God, coming into the soul of a man, takes sin away practically. And so it is in that way that the light of God coming into the world takes away the sin of the world. But all this would not have been possible except for the sacrifice -- hence the immense importance of the first part of the expression.
Ques. Is it an equivalent thought to what we have in the end of @Hebrews 9?
F.E.R. Yes. He has been manifested for the setting aside of sin.
Rem. But even there it goes far beyond the instrumental act. When He is manifested to any one it is then, and not till then, that the power of sin is broken, and the same thing will be true when He comes again.
Rem. "When it pleased God ... to reveal his Son in me".
F.E.R. Yes. It was that which broke the power of sin in Paul; sin was set aside; it is the manifestation of Christ that sets sin aside. The dealing with
{22}
sin sacrificially is one thing, and the setting aside of the principle is another; the one depends upon the other, but they are two distinct things.
Rem. Then really a deepening acquaintance with Christ is the true way of deliverance?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. He brings in what is completely and morally of *God* -- He baptises with the Holy Spirit. I think there are two things involved in that, first, the complete setting aside of sin in the universe, and then, with that, it is that "God may be all in all".
"Lamb of God" is not simply a title in which He stands in regard to Israel, but it is more general. When you come to Revelation, you get the thought more in connection with the world. The Lamb is "in the midst of the throne", and all that is in connection with the world. Then, too, the baptising with the Holy Spirit goes beyond the Jew. The promise is, "I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh". Then the "Son of God" has authority over the nations -- it is a title which has universal application.
Ques. Would you say that it is right for us to worship Him under the title of "Lamb of God"?
F.E.R. Well, you find the whole company in heaven worshipping the Lamb -- you have that fact to face. In the presence of that, it is very difficult to say we must not do homage to the Lamb. I do not think it is what is *peculiar* to the church -- the other heavenly saints are there; but what I should rather object to is the idea of excluding the worship of the Lamb. I cannot think that what we shall do in heaven can be very wrong upon earth. There may be something higher and nearer, but I should not like to call that wrong for us, when the whole twenty-four elders -- the whole priestly company in heaven -- are engaged in it.
Ques. "He was before me" -- is that pre-existence?
F.E.R. It is, I think, pre-eminence. It is His pre-eminence
{23}
as a divine Person. What marked Him out to John the Baptist was the fact of the Spirit descending and *remaining* on Him. It was not merely the announcement that the Spirit should *descend* upon Him -- the thought of the Spirit of God coming upon a man was a familiar one -- but it was that He should "abide" upon Him. John knew Him as the One who Himself should baptise with the Holy Spirit. You can scarcely have a more distinct testimony to the greatness of Christ than that He should baptise with the Holy Spirit. For that, a divine Person was needed.
Ques. Does it involve death and resurrection?
F.E.R. Well, yes. It is He who gives the Holy Spirit -- He sends Him, and for that He must be more than a mere man. No *man* can receive the Holy Spirit and send Him. The Holy Spirit takes the place of being "sent". He is content to take that place, and it is Christ who sends Him.
Rem. John repeats twice over, "I knew him not" (verses 31, 33).
F.E.R. Well, it is emphatic. I think it is the refusal on his part to acknowledge any natural knowledge of the Lord, from the fact of their being cousins, or anything of that sort. I think there is one principle which pervades the whole of the gospel -- that all was completely outside the flesh. It is an emphatic "I" -- it means "myself" personally. If you look at John naturally, he was a distinguished kind of man. His father and mother were both godly people, too. He was connected with the Lord by the ties of kindred, but, for the knowledge of God, all did not avail him. It appears to me he disclaims anything which might not have been true to any true Israelite.
Ques. Is it like @2 Corinthians 5 at all?
F.E.R. I think that passage looks at Christ as having passed out of the condition in which He had been. Those who were godly would have known Him
{24}
after the flesh, and that is how He was revealed to John the Baptist.
Ques. Would it include the intimacy in which John knew Him after the flesh?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so; and the disciples knew Him after the flesh -- He came in that order. But now even the Christ is no longer known in that order; what comes out now is "If any one be in Christ, there is a new creation". But there was the manifestation of Christ after the flesh -- "God was in Christ". It conveys to me the great importance of maintaining the unchangeability of the Person. The One who came after the flesh is the same One we know now as raised from the dead. The apostle Paul knew the very same Christ that Peter and John had known -- though Paul knew Him in resurrection.
Ques. What about the Spirit descending in the "form of a dove"? Somebody has said that it is in contrast to the "tongues of fire".
F.E.R. You see, the presence of the Spirit in us really involves self-judgment, but it was not in that way that He came upon Christ. Fire speaks of God's testing. I think that in early days they were not long in losing the moral effect or sense of the presence of the Holy Spirit. They wanted licence for the flesh, and the sense of the presence of the Holy Spirit soon died out. "They all slumbered and slept".
Ques. And then, I suppose, setting up a human ministry was a further result of that?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. I do not believe that any of us have any idea of what the church was at the very beginning. We cannot conceive for a moment what the power was when the Spirit was free, nor have we any idea of the holiness which the Spirit maintained. To set up anything again seems to me so presumptuous; it means that we think we can do better than any of those who have gone before us were able to do. The thing has failed once, and the probability is that
{25}
it would fail again, and, for my part, I do not want to be involved in any second failure. The presence of the Spirit must always demand self-judgment. If God is there, flesh must go. The Spirit will not tolerate the flesh.
Ques. That is the idea, is it not, in "The Spirit against the flesh"?
F.E.R. Yes. Neither one will tolerate the other. Now there was no need of self-judgment in Christ. The Spirit comes upon Him in the form of a dove, and it remains upon Him. It is a kind of figure -- the Spirit descending in that way -- to bring within the cognisance of men what God thought of His beloved Son. God took that way to do it.
Rem. In the sovereignty of His grace, would you say?
F.E.R. Well, the gospel of John is not so much characterised by the sovereignty of *grace* as by the sovereignty of *love*. God claims to be sovereign in *love*, but I think the grace of God is toward all men.
Ques. What about @John 3: 16?
F.E.R. That is His nature, in a certain sense, but even there, there is the element of purpose in it. God "gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life".
Ques. But is not that verse often used to prove God's nature -- One who cannot judge, and all that sort of thing, because He is love?
F.E.R. Yes. But then the love of God has come into the world in order to lead out of the world. Goodness comes to them to lead them out of prison. Man is shut up in prison, and God has opened a door out of it, but if people do not care to avail themselves of the door of escape out of the world, they come under the wrath.
Rem. "Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us". What is that?
{26}
F.E.R. Well, that is the greatness of the love, the style and character of it. It is the love of a Father to His children. We are in that place to God so that "we should be called children of God". If you are to be in the enjoyment of eternal life, it involves leaving the world, that is certain. What person in his senses could say he has eternal life in this world? If you are to find eternal life, you must find it outside this world. The love of God opens a door out of this world, and you really leave this world in spirit, and enter into relationship with God outside of it. I am a child of God, and an object of His love, although in the world everything may be against me, and I may have to meet the power of Satan and the persecution of men. In the millennium, it will not be a question of leaving the world, for God will have come into the world, but today we have to find God outside of the world. Christ has been into this world to draw our hearts out of it -- He is outside it, and God is outside it. If the Father draws to the Son, it must be to where the Son is.
John the Baptist puts great prominence to the thought of Christ being the "Lamb of God". It seems to be his one thought in regard of Christ. The latter part of the chapter takes in the three titles or glories of Christ -- Son of God, King of Israel, and Son of man -- but John seems to keep to the way in which Christ had been made known to him. This was his apprehension of Christ by the Holy Spirit. Everything had to begin with death, with sacrifice. The term could have no meaning save as viewed sacrificially, and He was *God's* Lamb, *God's* providing.
Verse 37 shows the immediate and proper effect of all true ministry and testimony, that is, to put the soul in direct relation with the Lord. Every system -- like the popish or high church system -- which does not effect this is a false one. John's testimony put the two disciples in direct relation to Christ. The Lord
{27}
turned and said, "What seek ye?" They say, "Where dwellest thou?" and the answer is, "Come and see", and they came and saw where He abode, and remained with Him that day. It is all very beautiful. It is an immense thing for the soul to get where the Lord *abides*. We never thoroughly know a person until we see where he abides, and his surroundings. By a merely casual visit we do not know a person.
<blockquote>"Our hearts resort to where Thou liv'st <br>In heaven's unclouded rays". (`25:2)</blockquote>
Heaven is His abiding place -- while He visits this world in the assembly, amongst His own.
It is a great question for each of us, Do we know where He abides? The words are really typical -- they indicate a question which has to be raised and answered in everyone's spiritual history. In the latter part of the gospel we find out how He reaches the place where He *abides*.
"Abide" is one of the great characteristic words of the gospel of John. It is translated "continue", "dwell", and "remain". "Many abodes" is from the same word. When the Lord said, "Come and see", you may depend there was not much of the glory of this world to look at. There would not be much in the surroundings to divert them from the Lord Himself. This is true, I believe, with regard to heaven as well as earth.
The fact that they went and saw where He dwelt proved that there was a divine work in them. All the work done in souls, I believe, is done by God. Ministry may supply a need which God has created, but God really effects everything in souls from beginning to end. God uses men to enlighten others, but communicating light is not *work*. *Work* is that which is ministered *affecting* a man, and that belongs to God. It is a great mistake to confound between the light which a servant may bring and the work of God.
{28}
You get the light through an instrument, but it is God who makes the light effective. Take the case of the jailer -- the work began with God, the exercise produced was of God. Then the apostle speaks the word of the Lord to him, and the word took effect -- this latter being the work of God. If it were not so, it would merely be the mind enlightened, but when God works, the truth is made effective in the *heart*, in the affections, as in the case of Lydia.
Another interesting point which comes out here is seen in the *links* which are formed -- Andrew finds Peter and brings him to Jesus; then Philip finds Nathanael. I do not think Andrew knew much about Jesus, but he had been drawn by John's testimony, and he felt that Peter had best come to the same Person. So with Philip and Nathanael -- they found they had come to the One who was full of divine light.
Peter gets an anticipation of @Matthew 16 here. He gets a new name, and that indicates that he was to be conspicuous in the new building -- a stone. "Thou art Peter, and on this rock I will build my assembly". That really confirmed what the Lord gave to him here in @John 1. In Peter's epistle the Lord is spoken of as the "living stone", and we are living stones -- but here it is more the idea of *rock*. In @Matthew 16 Peter is *of* the Rock. When we come to the church, we come to the point where all testimonies rest. Take the thought of *dwelling* -- God dwelt in the way of testimony when He dwelt in the tabernacle. So it is, too, in the presence of Christ here. God dwelt there, but in testimony, for He was veiled. So in the house of God now, God dwells by the Spirit, that is, in testimony; but, at the same time, you have another building which is growing, there is the actual constructing of that in which every testimony of God rests -- we are being formed morally now for what is going to be displayed, that is, the heavenly city, now actually in construction. The present time is the closing time
{29}
of testimony, and the beginning of that which is for display. What we get in @Ephesians 3 is what is going on now in view of display. When the heavenly city comes down it will be no longer testimony, it will be all display. Testimony is the time of faith. None save the men of faith had any benefit from the cloud which rested on the tent of testimony. So, too, when Christ was here, His words and works testified to God being there, but only those who had faith discerned it. In the time of display it will be no question of faith, the nations, as such, will walk in the light of God; it will then be sight, and no longer faith.
There are three great testimonies of God which come out in the Old Testament -- blessing, dwelling, and ruling -- and all these centre in the heavenly city. I think the Lord looked on to all this display when He said to Peter here, "Thou shalt be called Cephas", which is, by interpretation, a stone. What is going to be displayed then is what is growing now here. It "groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord", that is the heavenly city, and men walking in the light of it -- the public benefit of all that will be brought to pass in the millennium, although it will not effect any change in man apart from God's work in him. This is proved by the fact that, when the millennial age is over, men will again come under the power of the devil.
Ques. How do the three days come in here?
F.E.R. I should take it as, first, Peter's day, the building; secondly, Nathanael's day, "An Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile"; and thirdly, the third day as the figure of resurrection which introduces the marriage. Peter is a typical stone, as Nathanael was a typical Israelite according to God -- no fraud, no concealment from God. It is more difficult for people to take in what is referred to in the third day, that is, the idea of a scene being on the ground of resurrection. Resurrection itself is more easily understood; but without that being actually mentioned here, we come
{30}
into the view of a scene established on that ground. Death is dispossessed -- "swallowed up in victory". The judgment of God has been met, and the power of the enemy broken, and when Christ comes in He sets death aside and comes in in the power of resurrection. The practical working of it, in regard to saints, will be in the consciousness of a spiritual life outside and above the natural life. That will be the "good wine". They will have perfect happiness in the millennium, but it will not be bounded by the millennium. All that is natural will come to an end then, but what is spiritual will remain. In the new earth you will get a completely changed condition of existence. There will be no distinction between Jew and Gentile, but nevertheless *earth* will never be *heaven*. They are always kept distinct, although always bound together.
CHAPTERS 2: 23 - 25; 3: 1 - 21
F.E.R. The last two verses of chapter 2 bring before us the extent to which man as such can go, that is, a mental conviction -- believing on account of the miracles which he saw. Simon Magus went that far. It leaves them without light from God, though, at the same time, it leaves them without excuse. Signs bring no light from God, and a man might see the signs, and yet be unaffected morally. I take it that is the reason why the Lord would not trust them; no impression was really made upon them from God. The effect of God's touch is that a man does not stop at miracles. He might see a leper cleansed, or a dead person raised, but it is not a question merely of the miracles, but of light from God, and the grace which could come in touch with man's need. With the Lord, the great point was for them to receive His *testimony* concerning Himself and so it is now. The reception
{31}
of the Spirit's testimony of Christ is really what converts a man; but, from the very outset, the Lord did not trust Himself to man. He knew what was in man, just as He could reveal what was in God. He knew the worst feature in man, and that is, that he is not to be trusted if it be a question of the things of God. If a man were put to the test in regard to the things of God, he would always prove unfaithful. The fact is, God is the only One whom you can really trust.
All this paves the way for what comes out in the next chapter, I mean for the truth that man must be born again. A man must be made sensible of his need of God, for that is really the effect of being born again. Men *do* need God, but they are not sensible of it. He needs God even for happiness here in this world. He may be surrounded by everything, and yet there is one great element lacking if he has not God. I do not covet the richest man in the world if he has that lack, because it is *such* a lack -- such a moral deficiency. God is really a necessity to man's happiness, and He meant to be. Man secured his own will, and a great artificial world was built up for the glory of man, but he has not secured happiness thereby. Even where you least expect it, I believe there is a great deal of heart-burning and discontent. Man is man all the world over; you may get different training and surroundings, but that does not alter the man. God never intended that man should be happy without Him.
Nicodemus comes to the Lord with the conviction, and expresses it to the Lord, "Thou art a teacher come from God". He had come to that point, but he had only the idea of being taught -- he had not got the thought that man was to be the reflex of God Himself. Nicodemus, like most people, did not get beyond material ideas, and the Lord rebukes that. He says, "That which is born of the Spirit is *spirit*",
{32}
and not anything material. That is beyond the compass of man's mind, while he can understand "That which is born of the flesh is flesh".
Ques. What is "born of water"?
F.E.R. It is very difficult for us to understand. The *source* of it is referred to here, but the water here does not refer to a testimony presented. Israel, to whom the passage quoted from Ezekiel refers, will be sprinkled with clean water, but I do not see that testimony is brought to them. New birth is a work of God in man -- a work brought about by divine agency. There is no divine work in man save what is done by God Himself. It is the work of God which makes the light presented by the servant effective in the soul. People are begotten by the testimony -- I can understand that. So converts are accounted children of the testimony. The apostle says, "In Christ Jesus I have begotten you by the gospel"; but we cannot understand, or follow, or take account of new birth. It is the *secret* work of the Spirit of God, and like the wind you cannot tell whence it comes or whither it goes. In divine things it is very true that you cannot take account of anything until you have got it. "New birth" is absolutely *clean*, from the very nature of it, water being the source of it. It produces a cry, from sheer craving after God -- it is pure in that sense. A man may be in distress and cry to God, but I would not call that pure. The cry of new birth is absolutely pure -- a real craving after God, with no ulterior motive.
If you make "born of water" the *word*, it is making it too definite, and you lose the moral idea. "Water" is used in Scripture as a figure of "the word", but so it is of the Spirit, and it is also indicative of cleansing, but I believe the idea intended to be conveyed here is being born of the Spirit. The Lord puts it very definitely, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit". It would
{33}
be too absolute if it were put, "*He* who is born of the Spirit is spirit", and therefore it is put in an abstract form. New birth is a work by which God becomes a necessity to man. It is a genuine, *bona fide* work of God, which produces the first real cry of desire after God. The effect of it is that we can *see*, and there is nothing like it. The kingdom was presented to man in the way of testimony, and, for that reason, it needed new birth for a man to see and enter into it. The Lord here, as a humble Man on earth, was really the testimony of the kingdom, while man was so high that he could not look down and see it, and he needed, therefore, to be born again to see the kingdom there in the Person of the humbled Christ. I wonder what God would think of *man's* kingdom, as man glories in it! It is simply man glorying in his shame -- his armaments, and such like. That will not do for God. The fact is, all that God brings in is *moral*, and for men to boast in the means of destruction is to glory in their shame, and ought rather to lead them to hide their diminished heads. Man needed to be born again to see the kingdom in a humbled Christ, and now he needs it to see the kingdom in a glorified Christ. One was too low, the other is too high. The work of God was needed to bring man to a collapse, like a rent balloon, so that he should have eyes to see what is of God.
Men come into the kingdom by faith; they accept it first and so come into it. We want to preach the kingdom of God now, that is, to bring man's soul under the moral sway of God. The epistle to the Romans all goes on the ground of the kingdom of God. "Righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit", infinitely transcends all that this world can give me.
Ques. "We speak that we do know", etc. (verse 11) what is that?
F.E.R. It refers to the particular character of the
{34}
Lord's testimony. No prophet could have said that. It says the prophets searched diligently "what ... the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify". They could not go beyond that. John the Baptist was the close of one order of testimony, and the Lord was bringing in a new order, and it is this character of testimony which marks Christianity. The secret for us lies in the Spirit. The practical effect of speaking of new birth to a Jew was to put the Jew, as such, out of court, in order to put things upon a broader platform, and lead up to the "whosoever".
There is a complete change in the character of the testimony from verse 11. The great subject of the testimony now is Christ, and *we* can say, "We see Jesus ... crowned with glory and honour". We can, as it were, say, "We speak that we do know". Our witness is simply a confirmation of what the Lord introduced. Everything is changed, for the Lord goes on to say in verse 12, "If I have said the earthly things to you", and "if I say the heavenly things". It is only here and in @Hebrews 9: 23, as far as I know, where you get the expression used, "heavenly things", and I believe it refers to Christianity.
All the promises of God go to make up one great system. This we get in the Old Testament scriptures, and then in the New Testament we see a completely new element, and that is a worshipping company, the church, really the "heavenly things". "Heavenly things" bring in an additional thought to what we get in the Old Testament; there will be a vast system of blessing, but it would not be complete without the worshipping company. We do not get the heavenly things until He has entered in. He is there the last Adam in subsisting righteousness, and the system is formed, the answer to it being that the house of God is formed down here.
Then another thing comes out here, that we are shut up to the Lord for light as to these things (verse 13),
{35}
"No man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven". "Son of man ... in heaven" is a remarkable designation; it is what is characteristic of Him, that He is in heaven. He may leave that place, but His proper habitation is heaven.
CHAPTERS 3; 4: 1 - 42
F.E.R. It is important to trace the Lord's passage from Judaea into Galilee, and to see what comes out in each part of it. He left Judaea and went away again unto Galilee. "And he must needs go through Samaria".
Ques. Do you mean what *morally* characterises it?
F.E.R. Yes, the testimony which comes out in each place. The testimony at Jerusalem was, "Ye must be born again". Then in Samaria it was the gift of the Spirit, and in Galilee He raises the nobleman's son -- He gives the confirmation of the nobleman's faith. The teacher -- Nicodemus -- had the most elementary teaching of all, "Ye must be born again". This was at Jerusalem, the seat of light. Then, too, the Lord was entirely dependent on the will of the Father -- "My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work". He depended on the Father, as one might say, for an opening -- He did not make one for Himself.
The great importance of this passage to us is that chapter 4 forms the completion of what comes out in chapter 3. The thought that comes out there is that "Whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life". Well, how are you going to get eternal life? How is it to be effected? You get in chapter 3 the statement of the purpose, and how to get eternal life is solved in chapter 4 -- "The water which I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of
{36}
water, springing up into eternal life". You must have the two sides of it; on the one hand the unfolding of divine purpose, that you may know what the mind of God is, and then, on the other side, the making good that purpose in us.
Ques. Did you say we get the purpose in chapter 3?
F.E.R. Yes. And in chapter 4 the Lord shows how that purpose is to be made good in us. The purpose reaches man through death, "The Son of man must be lifted up". God could not approach man except through death. Death lay in the way as between God and man. He could only approach man through death, and death lay on man.
Ques. I suppose it was not only sin that had to be dealt with, but death?
F.E.R. Well, quite so. Man is under death, but that is the way by which God approaches man. You get the same thought in @Romans 3. The blood there is the witness of God's righteousness when it is a question of God's approach to man -- He really reveals His righteousness there. You get here in @John 3 the Son of man lifted up, but what lies behind that? "God so loved the world".
Rem. The lifting up was the necessity to the purpose of God's love.
F.E.R. Yes. I think there had to be a demonstration before God of what man's true state and condition was. That was suitable for the glory of God. It took place on the cross, but the wonderful thing is that, as having made that demonstration, He *disappears*, and then re-appears as the Communicator of the Spirit in resurrection. That is chapter 4. The Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world baptises with the Holy Spirit. And John the Baptist says, "I saw and bare record that this is the Son of God".
Ques. Is that why the testimony of the gift of the Spirit is given outside Jerusalem?
F.E.R. I think so. A slight is cast on the Jew,
{37}
and on everything connected with him, all through John's gospel.
Ques. In consequence of the statement in chapter 1 that "he came unto his own, and his own received him not"?
F.E.R. Yes. That explains the Lord's conduct to them all through. A man like Nicodemus, for instance, thought he could be *instructed*, but what he really wanted was not teaching but a divine work in him.
Ques. In what way is salvation of the Jews?
F.E.R. Well, God is faithful in that way -- the testimony of God always went out from the Jews. Even the apostle to the Gentiles was a Jew. I think you get nothing in the New Testament except through the Jews; even Luke only wrote as he had word from those who were "eye-witnesses of and attendants on the Word".
Ques. Do you mean that any light they had was through the Jews?
F.E.R. I do. The Jews were the depositaries of the Scriptures, everything in that way belonged to them -- the oracles of God belonged to them. God has certain methods and ways, and He does not depart from them. It was on this principle that He sends the gospel to Jerusalem first. Jerusalem was still owned, in a way. It is interesting to see that there is a sort of overlapping. There is a recognition of Jerusalem, it is not absolutely set aside. Of course, when their perversity came fully out, then the testimony of God left Jerusalem.
Rem. But they had another chance, as it were.
F.E.R. Yes. As Peter said to them, He shall send Jesus back to you; @Acts 3.
Rem. I was thinking about what you were saying as to new birth just now. It says in Galatians, "Jerusalem which is now, for she is in bondage with her children", but "the Jerusalem above is free,
{38}
which is our mother". You must have a new start, you must be born of Jerusalem which is above.
F.E.R. Quite so. Of course, too, the guilt of the Jew was not then complete; but when the testimony of the Spirit came and there was knowledge, and yet they rejected Him (@Acts 7), then the testimony of God left Jerusalem. But, even then, God did not repudiate her. His eye is upon her still, though she has been set aside for the Jerusalem above. "The gifts and calling of God are without repentance", and God will begin again with her. "The desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband".
Rem. So Jerusalem is called "the holy city" even after the crucifixion.
F.E.R. The fact is, that when Jerusalem is set aside there is nothing but Babylon here. That is one very great reason why I should not be disposed to take any part in Jubilee festivities, because, in the eye of God, it is Babylonish. It is times of the Gentiles, and Jerusalem is trodden underfoot, but God still has His eye upon her. He does not lose sight of Babylon either, for that matter. All the glory of man is Babylonish in the eye of God. It is not conferred of God -- its source is really man. I believe it is a great mistake not to see this.
Rem. It is striking that what passes away from Jerusalem goes to where the false temple had been, that is, Samaria.
F.E.R. Yes. But I think it is not difficult to understand the complete change and newness of what had come in. When He speaks of what He would give, all was to be completely new. On God's side there was nothing new, but on the woman's side everything must be completely new.
Rem. I suppose it would be easier for her to understand the necessity of all being new than it would be for Nicodemus.
{39}
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. The fact is, God has not altered; it is only that He has expressed Himself. The love of God was just as much a reality at the beginning as when it came out -- there was no alteration on God's side -- but there was a moment when the love of God came out, and what that love brings to light is that God has opened a door out of this world. It is not that He has reinstated man, but He has opened a door for man into a new sphere. The point you have to reach in chapter 3 is the Son of man lifted up -- the Son of man risen from the dead. If that were not a necessity, it would mean that you could have eternal life without Christ, but we find it is to him that "believeth in him". The man must reach the sphere where Christ is, and that is not this world. You could not bring resurrection into this world. Now "Easter Sunday" and "Whit Sunday" are the most incomprehensible institutions that I can conceive of. I can understand "Good Friday", but how can you make events out of what the mind of man cannot possibly take cognisance of? Man's mind can take cognisance of death, but it cannot touch resurrection.
Rem. And how is a man going to commemorate His death who does not know His resurrection?
F.E.R. Just so. I can understand their commemorating anything that comes within man's cognisance, but Christ has gone into a sphere which is beyond the cognisance of man's mind. No one can get there but by the Holy Spirit.
Ques. Then death would be the door out of this world?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. It is a very important point to see that God has opened a door. The door is *open*. I may have a very great deal to learn, but still God has opened the door.
Ques. Why do you lay such stress on that?
F.E.R. Because it shows that everything is clear
{40}
on God's side -- all is clear for God. Take the simplest believer -- God can communicate to him the gift of the Spirit. That would not be the case if the flesh had not been ended for God. It would be impossible for God to communicate the Spirit unless the flesh had been ended. It is a long time, perhaps, before we come to it on our side. God approaches it from His side, and we have to come to it in another way -- not quite so quickly as God has done -- but we reach the same point. Many a lesson has to be learned on the road to it, and before I can say, "I am crucified with Christ".
Rem. You must pass through the door.
F.E.R. Yes. But I think faith passes you through the door, and then you have really got experimentally to reach Christ after you believe. You believe in Christ -- that is the ground of your faith -- and you receive the Spirit, and then you have to reach Christ experimentally where He is. It is like @Romans 8, but you have to go through chapters 6 and 7 to get there.
What a wonderful picture it is at the beginning of the chapter (@John 4) -- the Lord wearied, and sitting just as He was on the well! And then the poor sinful woman comes to draw water, and the wonderful thing is that He does not wait for her to approach Him, but He approaches her. He begins, and says to her, "If thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water". If man is to get anything at all, it must result from God's first approaching him. God only can save. He sought, and man *must be sought*.
Rem. A Jew would have said that the Lord had gone very far afield this time.
F.E.R. Yes. And the woman, too, looked at things in a kind of casual way, a natural way. It is the great hindrance with people still.
{41}
Rem. In the state in which she was, she could not have seen things in any other way.
F.E.R. No. And when you come to think of it, the Spirit of God dwelling in one is an astounding thought, even to us. To think of having "a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life" -- "living water" -- is wonderful. She could not have had the feeblest idea of the line upon which God was giving; and people today do not enter at all into the goodness of God, nor do they see the line upon which God gives -- they do not understand His "giving". It is the last thing they will allow -- the goodness of God. All they think of is how to prepare themselves to be suitable to Him -- instead of apprehending how entirely unsuitable they are. The ignorant heathen seek to appease God, and the respectable and civilised seek to be made suitable to God. Man fails to see that God has come close to him in order that He might communicate to him the gift of the Spirit. I think that is the great point to which everything tends. The work of the Lord here was really to prepare a little company to receive the Holy Spirit, and He only comes consequent upon the rejection of Christ.
He "sat thus on the well". To all outward appearance He was just a wearied traveller, but the real truth was that He was presenting God to the woman -- God was here. I think we fall short altogether if we do not apprehend that He was presenting God. God has been manifested in flesh. It was the moral power in that One which affected souls and drew them.
Rem. It is very helpful to see how the Lord received and dealt with particular cases.
F.E.R. Yes. It is that which makes the gospels so essential to understand God's approach to man -- you see it there in the Person. Neither could you understand the truth of the church except as you saw what the Lord was in the midst of His disciples. No amount of doctrine will give it to you. You must see the
{42}
tenderness of the Lord to His disciples, and the way He came down to their capacities, and His affection for them, to understand what the Lord could be to the company now.
Rem. You could not conceive a lower place for the Lord to come to, nor a lower person for Him to talk to, than this poor sinful woman, and the Lord has to bring light to her conscience such as she needed. He did not tell Nicodemus of the well of water.
F.E.R. I think she serves as a foil to the Lord in order that grace might come out. It all shows that not a bit of man in any form was to be recognised. The best, as well as the worst, has to go. You take any human quality you like -- it will surely break down if pressure is brought in. I think you may look upon every purely human quality in that way.
What comes out in this chapter (4) is that eternal life springs up from what a believer has *within*. Life is subjective, and the truth comes out in this chapter that eternal life springs up from what is within a man -- that is really deliverance. I think the Spirit comes as living water from above to make a man's heart conscious of what has already been given to him. No man knows the love of God until he has the Spirit. You may believe the testimony of it, but no man can know anything of it but by the Holy Spirit. You cannot have the thing experimentally in any other way. The first principles of the gospel are righteousness and power, and then you become conscious of another thing, and that is, the love of God. That is His nature. I think that when the Holy Spirit comes to shed abroad the love of God in the heart, then it is we have the well of water springing up.
Ques. It is the love side that is presented to Nicodemus, is it not?
F.E.R. Yes. But that is from God's point of view. The Son of man was lifted up, but the secret which lay behind that was the love of God -- "God so loved
{43}
the world". You may attempt to preach the gospel to other people, and you preach from what you know, and from where you are, as the Lord Himself says, "We speak that we do know"; but as to their apprehension of things, that is quite another matter. I think Romans makes that quite clear. The first thing presented to man is the righteousness and power of God. These are principles which a man must know first. I think the point with God is to lay a foundation in a man's soul, and righteousness must be first. It would be no good to lay a foundation of love in the soul of a sinful man -- you want righteousness first. Then, too, I do not think that love in itself would give you ground for hope in God; what gives you hope is the knowledge of His power, and then, when the Spirit is given and sheds the love of God abroad in the heart, you know the well of water that springs up to eternal life. The Spirit springing up is a well of water in the believer, and you are formed in the divine nature. It is the formative work of the Spirit. You are filled and fashioned and emancipated. I believe that is the great thought in the passage. That is the way a person can be really emancipated from sin -- practically set free from the control of sin.
What came out in connection with Nicodemus was really the setting aside of man, but here it is more the positive side. The Lord does not say a word to Nicodemus as to the subjective side, but here what you get is that you are formed, subjectively, by the new power. You are drawn away from everything here by a new power entirely, and as you grow in it, you are practically set free from sin. I do not think there is any emancipation otherwise. Deliverance must come in concurrently with the divine nature, otherwise you would have the flesh delivering itself, which is impossible.
Ques. Is not that the common thought of man?
F.E.R. Yes, I think it is. But it is ineffective -- it
{44}
will break down somewhere. The fact is (as before referred to), man has to travel a long road to the cross, whereas God has travelled by a very short one. I mean as to the end of man, which is where the gospel starts from. The death of Christ was all there before God, but, as we see in the case of the children of Israel, the man was gone for God at the outset, but they had to travel for thirty-eight years to reach it. That is why I have said that @Numbers 21 is concurrent with chapter 1. The first twenty chapters are concurrent with what comes in in chapter 21 and after.
Ques. In what way do you mean?
F.E.R. Well, like @Romans 8, that is your beginning; the communication of the Spirit is the beginning of the Christian's history. He begins "in the Spirit", not "in the flesh". You begin now where God begins, but then you have to *come* to it. Until then you have not apprehended a single bit the good of it. That is where the earlier chapters come in.
Rem. The springing well, then, is the apprehension of what lies in the Spirit?
F.E.R. Well, not entirely, because one follows on the other. The gift of the Spirit follows upon the cross, and so the Lord could talk to a poor sinful woman about the gift of God, and she would get there from the outset; but then she would have to learn all the lessons of @Numbers 1 - 20, what the flesh is, and to learn, too, what the ways of God are with a people in the wilderness, with a view to their moral education. The wilderness is a necessity for us, and not for God. If you did not learn certain things, you would not know the secret of the water from the rock, or the necessity of the water of purification. He meets the need of the people, it is true, but the need *must* be learned.
It is very important to distinguish between the principles on which God works and our apprehension of it all, and the way in which we reach it. God
{45}
reached it in His own way, entirely independent of man, but we have to reach it by the road proper to man. I am sure of this, that you must not only have faith, but you must reach experimentally the point which God has reached, in your own soul's history. It is only in that way you enjoy *fully* what God has given. "We are the circumcision, which worship God in the Spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh". We have to come to that, although it takes a long time with some. God arrives at it quickly, but it is a great mercy to us that we get the good of it without having to wait to reach it experimentally. You really have it by faith, but for the full good of it you must have it experimentally. There are many things we must learn; the waters of Marah were to be drunk, and we have to find out the indisposition of the flesh to enter the land, its inertness, and all that, so that we may learn how indispensable God's provisions are for us while in the wilderness.
The fact is, only God knows our need, and He has ordered His ways from His knowledge of man's need. You may think to find a short cut into the land -- as people say, a matter of eleven days or so -- but for all that, you will find that this is a scene of dead bones, where you want the water of purification, and a dry and thirsty land where you will want the water of refreshment.
CHAPTER 5: 1 - 30
F.E.R. We had the revelation of God -- His present mind, the revelation of His will -- in chapter 3, and then we got the communication of the Spirit in chapter 4. The latter comes out in Samaria in connection with the Lord's progress from Judaea to Galilee. Then He goes on to Galilee, and completes the testimony by showing God's faithfulness to the Jew, or rather to Israel.
{46}
The great point in what comes out in Galilee is that between Israel and God there must be the link of faith; so the Lord says to the nobleman, "Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe". He challenges him in that way. The nobleman, however, believes the word of Jesus, and the link is established between them in that way, while Israel, as a whole, would be characterised by the craving to see "signs and wonders". Without faith a man has no light or knowledge of God. It is by faith the link is formed. This man is brought into distress, and in a kind of way he feels that Christ is his only helper, but he was really looking upon the raising up of his son as a ground of faith, and the Lord rebukes that. When he rested simply on the word of Christ he gets the sign as a confirmation. You see, faith would not be *moral* if it depended upon a sign, but when faith is there, the sign comes in to confirm it. It is so difficult to man -- and I think we know something of it in ourselves -- to believe in the goodness of God, that He has pleasure in *good*.
I think chapter 5 brings in a further development. Chapters 3 and 4 go together. You get in chapter 3 light as to what is God's will -- what He had before Him -- and chapter 4 brings in the way in which it is effected in us. One great point is emancipation from sin. You get a person taken up who was under the control of sin, and the effect of the Spirit springing up in her was to emancipate her from sin. It answers to "That the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin". That is what the Lord made good in regard to her. In chapter 3 there is foreshadowed the truth of the old man being crucified with Christ, but then the woman was to be emancipated from sin, and that is really by the power of the Spirit within her, as set forth in chapter 4. "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death". It is the emancipation
{47}
of a poor sinful woman in the very place of her sin, for it was in Samaria that she was emancipated. She was not taken out of Samaria, but emancipated there. The very principle of Christianity is that in the scene of your sin you are to be delivered from it. So, too, it is in the world that you are to overcome the world. Resurrection is what takes place upon earth -- it is not in heaven, but upon earth, that by the power of God a man is taken out of death; it is in the very scene where he died. This is very distinctly dealt with in chapter 5. Chapter 4 is emancipation, while chapter 5 brings in *quickening*. This latter comes in really in view of relationship.
Ques. Does that bring in the thought of nature?
F.E.R. Well, I think it does, in a sense. The thought of quickening in Scripture is that it introduces the object of it into relationship. I think that quickening is a much broader term than we have supposed. You are looked at as being made alive out of the state of death in which you were found, in order to get an entirely new place of relationship with the Father. He quickens "whom he will". It is for Himself -- for the place they are to have before Him.
Ques. It is not just emancipation here?
F.E.R. No; it is more positive. Here you share the place of the Son of God. It is the same in Ephesians -- you are quickened together with Christ. We are made alive before God in company with Christ, it is "with him".
Ques. What about the man here at the pool?
F.E.R. He is really, in type, quickened that he might live before God. The man is raised up by the word of Christ. It is really, in type, the application of the word of Christ to the Jew, and will get its accomplishment in the future with the Jew, when the law is written in the heart of the Jew. Then it is he will carry his bed. It has often been said that what marks the present moment with the Jew is that his
{48}
bed carries him; but when the law is written in their hearts, they will carry their bed. The man here is helpless, yet at the word of Christ he carries his bed.
Ques. Is that why he was healed on the sabbath?
F.E.R. I think it was the purpose of the Lord to call attention to it -- it was providential. The sabbath was the sign of the covenant, and many of the Lord's miracles were wrought on the sabbath. The covenant had grown old and was on the point of being broken up. It has often been a stumbling-block -- the Lord doing miracles on the sabbath. In the eye of God the covenant was already broken.
Ques. Why does it specify thirty-eight years?
F.E.R. Well, it corresponds with the length of the wilderness journey up to the time of the brazen serpent, and to the death of Moses. It indicates the probationary period; it was over -- he had lain there thirty-eight years in that case, but now he gets a new start by the word of Christ.
It is so important to see that quickening really means that a man is made *consciously alive* out of a previous state of death. But then, *how*? You must be made alive in reference to something. It is not just like a vegetable -- a man is made alive in reference to something, and, as a matter of fact, he is made alive in relation to the Father. The effect of the quickening word is to bring you consciously into relationship to the Father. "The Father quickens whom he will".
Ques. Why is it that it comes in after the gift of the Spirit, as in chapter 4?
F.E.R. Well, you find the same thing in @Romans 8. You first get emancipation, and then later on you have the same Spirit spoken of as the Spirit of sonship. The Spirit is looked at first as the power of deliverance, and then you get the thought of life, and then, too, of sonship. You have all in the power of the same Spirit, but there is a kind of moral order. The Lord says,
{49}
"It is the Spirit which quickens, the flesh profits nothing". I believe people put too limited a meaning on the word "quickening". There is a remarkable force in it.
Rem. It has been applied to new birth.
F.E.R. Yes; but that is not the idea of it in Scripture. It is evident enough in this passage that the Lord was quickening in view of the Father -- that is the great point in the chapter -- and He was acting in perfect concert with the Father.
Rem. "The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do".
F.E.R. Exactly. If you are quickened by the Son, it is that you may live to the Father. It is to bring you into the place of children, and He completes the work eventually. It goes on to the raising of the body.
Ques. Does quickening come after the gift of the Spirit?
F.E.R. Well, at all events, the realisation of it does -- the effectuality of it is really after the Spirit is received.
Rem. But you must have the Spirit to know it.
F.E.R. The Spirit is received before there is any formative work of the Spirit. Quickening is the result of the Spirit's formative work, and not simply of His being there. A man is made alive, he is quickened, in that relationship.
Rem. Actually it is *after*.
F.E.R. Well, yes. It is the renewing of the Holy Spirit; you get that, too, when the Holy Spirit is received. He is "shed on us abundantly", and then He renews. The renewing was when the Holy Spirit was shed, not before. We cannot know this relationship apart from *love*. The fact of it is, that quickening brings you into the divine nature. It is a positive thing. No one can know the Father -- can touch Him -- except in love. It is not faith that enables you to know the Father. To believe in the Father is one
{50}
thing, but to know Him is another. I do not think you know the Father apart from the divine nature.
Rem. The one is objective, and the other subjective.
F.E.R. Yes. The Holy Spirit is the completion of one line, but then He is the beginning of another. If you take the responsibility line in a man, the Holy Spirit is the completion of that line in this way, that when he has faith, then he is sealed by the Spirit. God puts His seal on him, and that is the end of that line; but then there is the line of purpose and the Holy Spirit is the beginning of that line. I venture to say there are thousands of Christians who apprehend the Spirit as the closing up of the one line, but they do not know Him as the beginning of another line. When you get to @Romans 8 you begin on an entirely new line.
Ques. Is there any type which sets forth the first to us?
F.E.R. The first, I imagine, is supposed when they come through the Red Sea -- the presence of the Holy Spirit is assumed when they are brought through the Red Sea.
Ques. That is, on God's side?
F.E.R. Yes, it is. But then it was a kind of seal upon them.
Rem. You were saying that God justifies a man in order to give him the Spirit.
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. Everything depends on the Spirit.
Ques. Does the gospel end at the first?
F.E.R. Well, yes, in one way. But you know you have to take into account a good deal more than that. Man is to be justified by faith in the blood of Christ, and the Holy Spirit is given; and then, in a certain sense, that is the end of the gospel -- the man is sealed for the day of redemption. If you look at a Christian as on the line for heaven, he is sealed for it, and the whole course is clear; but then that is only one line,
{51}
and that line, too, in one sense, will come to an end. But what is so important is this, that the Holy Spirit is the beginning of another line, and that is according to God's purpose -- that is where you really begin.
Rem. I think you have pointed out that Miriam never got into the land.
F.E.R. No. Neither Miriam nor Aaron. Even Moses came to an end, and the new line all comes out in connection with Joshua. He is the leader on the new line.
Ques. Is quickening new creation?
F.E.R. Well, they stand in different connections, but they are virtually the same. New creation is connected with good works, and walk, and all that -- in a moral connection. We are "created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them", and the "new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness". Then in Galatians we have, "As many as walk according to this rule" -- that is, the rule of new creation. New creation and good works go together, but quickening is that which God effects for Himself -- it is not that He quickens you for good works. When it is the thought of the *Father*, then you get quickening, but new creation is more a moral idea.
Rem. The one is man-ward and the other God-ward.
F.E.R. The new man comes out where the old man was, that is, down here. "We are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works". Now the whole point of this chapter is that you are quickened for the Father.
Ques. Is that what you mean when you speak of a soul beginning on a new line?
F.E.R. Yes. It is "the renewing of the Holy Spirit". A vast number of Christians apprehend the Holy Spirit on the one line who do not apprehend Him on the other. The former is on the responsibility
{52}
line, but the latter on the line of God's purpose. Now the gospel of John almost ignores the former, and makes very prominent the latter -- it is almost exclusively occupied with the *purpose* line.
I think the first part of the chapter is very beautiful, and the beauty is that the Lord does not go beyond what is proper to Israel. He does not speak of heavenly things, but He tells forth what will be true for Israel, and then He goes on to show them "greater things".
In the legal system everything depended upon a man's ability to get the relief which it afforded him, but we see here that the man who most wanted it was the man who did not get it. The whole providential system was given on legal ground, which took account of competency in man to avail himself of it. If there had been any grace in the others they would have let the man who had been there thirty-eight years get down first, but, as he said, "While I am coming, another steppeth down before me", and that had been not only once or twice, but thirty-eight times. There is not much grace there, in fact the system did not admit of it.
I think now we see the revelation of God in contrast with providence. Many people's thoughts do not go beyond providence. They say, "God helps those who help themselves". I believe many people think that, but the revelation of God comes in and helps a man who cannot help himself. In this chapter we see that one word of Christ helps the man who *cannot* help himself "Take up thy bed and walk"; and on the same day was the sabbath. When man is relieved from the pressure which is upon him, then you get a sabbath.
Rem. And that is what God will do for Israel.
F.E.R. Yes, quite so, and that brings in the true sabbath. The law will be written in their hearts, although we must remember that this can only be done
{53}
by One who can relieve them from death. Christ can quicken out of death -- the judgment of God -- and that is the reason why the Lord is brought before us in this chapter as the Son. No one could take man out of that state but the Son; and so the law can be written in their hearts because it is in the power of Christ to relieve from the pressure of death. I do not hesitate to use the expression that really God Himself came into the place of man's judgment. I know what I am saying -- it was the great testimony of God that He, in the Person of His Son, came into the place of man's judgment. If it was God's judgment, none but God could relieve man from it, and He did it by coming Himself into the place of that judgment. "God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law".
Rem. It presents God in a very blessed way.
F.E.R. I think it is the whole gist of the chapter that He could remove the judgment, He could quicken man out of death. Death was upon man, as well as *in* him, and that judgment must be removed in order that man might pass out of death.
Ques. What is meant by death *in* man?
F.E.R. It is man's weakness, his inability to please God. The law brings home to me that death is in me, and it brings death into me. The man in @Romans 7 was dead before, but he did not know it; he only realises it when the claims of the law are recognised.
I think that expression of the Lord, "Take up thy bed and walk", is one of the most wonderful things that came out in the Lord's ministry. The man was to walk in newness of life, and on the same day was the sabbath. What does that imply? They would be able to please God. Enoch walked with God, and had the testimony that he pleased God. That was outside of death. He was translated, and had light as to
{54}
translation, which was outside of death, just as Abel had light as to acceptance; that was his light.
Ques. What about the man sick of the palsy in @Luke 5 -- he took up his bed and walked? Is that the same at all?
F.E.R. Yes, it is just the same principle. Palsy sets forth man's moral weakness -- his inability to walk. But there was another thing in connection with this man -- the Lord says to him, "Thy sins are forgiven thee". The proof that his sins are forgiven is that he is relieved from death, and no man can say that his sins are forgiven if he is not relieved from death.
In @Romans 6 death is on man, and in chapter 7 it is *in* him. In the former you are buried because sin is on you -- you are buried into Christ's death. Christ has come into my death and I am buried into His. Then in chapter 7 I know that death was *on* me, but the law brought home that death was *in* me -- it killed me, I was perfectly helpless.
There is one thing very painful in this chapter (@John 5), and that is, that the man is so heartless that he does not seem in the least touched, and the Jews are perfectly heartless. The Lord says to him, "Sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee"; but I cannot help thinking that if the man had been touched, he would have stayed with the Lord, or gone home, and not have gone to the Jews, apparently with a view to stirring up opposition. I have noticed that, where you find orthodoxy, it is almost always allied with great heartlessness. There may be great zeal for the truth and so on, but very little in the way of warmth or affection. In this case the Jews were zealous for the sabbath, but see how hard they were. However, it all serves as an occasion for testimony. "The Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day". But Jesus answered them, "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work". And therefore they sought the more to kill
{55}
Him, because, as they declared, not only had He broken the sabbath, but said that God was His Father, making Himself equal with God.
It is very wonderful the character of the Lord's works. "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work" -- not great works of destruction, such as man may work, but here it is a palsied man, who had lain on his bed for thirty-eight years, to whom the Lord said, "Take up thy bed, and walk". The fact is, when God comes into a scene of sin, it is to relieve man from the pressure and effects of sin. Ever since sin came into the world that had been true. The ways of God all foreshadowed man being relieved from the pressure which sin had brought in upon him. You will find all through Scripture the thought presented of death being set aside. It comes out from the very beginning -- man died, Abel died, but he had first found a place of acceptance with God. Then Enoch comes in, and he is translated so that he should not see death at all. You get testimony after testimony of what was God's thought about it. With Moses, too, at the bush, the testimony is, "I am ... the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob", that is, that death is being set aside by resurrection.
"My Father worketh hitherto, and I work". How often, in the present day, you come across people who are insensible to any goodness in God. People talk about "the Psalmist", and that sort of thing, and quote Scripture in a flippant sort of way, but they have not the faintest impression of the goodness of God. It is so sad, in the midst of a people professedly Christian, with a certain familiarity with the letter of Scripture, to see how little knowledge there is of God's goodness. God's dealings in grace are really summed up in the expression, "My Father worketh". The law was dealing with man in responsibility, but the idea was that it was to be *written*. For the moment, I know it was written on tables of stone, but the divine
{56}
idea was that it was to be written in the heart of man. When Moses went up into the mount, he unveiled his face -- he was a picture of Christ. God looked to the end, and the end really was "the glory of the Lord". The people were not allowed to look to the end, but it was there before God, and I think you can understand why the law was written on tables of stone. It was because Christ had not yet come. Until He was here upon earth you could not have the law written on men's hearts; He must be the first, and when He came, He could say, in the language of the Spirit in David, "Thy law is within my heart". It was not that it needed to be there -- it was there, and it was God's thought from the outset. It was from that standpoint that God could charge Moses to take from the people of Israel the materials for the building of the sanctuary.
CHAPTER 5: 19 TO END
F.E.R. What we see here is that the perversity of the Jews just became an occasion of bringing out more light and truth. The same thing comes out in the next chapter. When they ask the Lord for a sign, He turns it into an opportunity for opening up more truth. The perversity and crookedness of man is turned to account in that way.
Rem. You get the same thing, too, in regard to the woman in chapter 4. The Lord takes the opportunity of bringing out the truth in regard to the Spirit.
F.E.R. Yes. And again when she speaks of worship, the Lord uses it as an occasion to open up what the will of the Father was, and so on, with regard to worship. Here they charge the Lord with calling God His own Father, and the Lord takes occasion to bring to light the relations which existed between the Father and Himself, and what comes out so solemnly is this, that if they saw Him they saw the Father. The Lord
{57}
was doing what the Father showed Him -- the works really showed forth the Father.
Ques. Why did you say, "The Son can do nothing of himself save whatever he sees the Father *doing*"?
F.E.R. It is the participle -- it is characteristic. It indicates that whatsoever the Father might be doing, He showed the Son, "For the Father loveth the Son". The expression really is, "For the Father has affection for the Son and shews to him all things whatsoever he is doing". He shows it all to the Son.
Rem. It makes it all the more solemn that they should have refused Him, for all the works that He did were of love and of mercy.
F.E.R. Yes, they were really the works of the Father. It has been pointed out that, in John, when it is a question of what God is morally, it is GOD who is spoken of, but when it contemplates the activities of grace, then it is the Father, "My Father worketh". It comes out rather remarkably in the previous chapter, where the Lord says, "The true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the *Father* seeketh such to worship him"; and then, in the next verse, "God is a Spirit". That has to be taken into account. He is not worshipped materially -- you cannot worship Him in material things, but it must be "in spirit and in truth".
Rem. He is not "worshipped with men's hands".
Ques. Is that distinction between "God" and the "Father" kept up all through Scripture?
F.E.R. Well, I do not know that it is quite that in all Scripture, but it is so very markedly in John, especially in the gospel.
It is important, if you are to understand things at all, to see that there is a progressive development of the truth in these chapters. What I mean is that there is a method, a definite order, adopted by the Spirit. In chapter 4 it is what God *gives* -- the living water; but what you get in chapter 5 is what is *brought to us*,
{58}
the light of the Father. The well of water is to be *in* you, while the Father is revealed *to* you. The great point in chapter 4 is the emancipation of man from irregular and unsatisfied desire -- that is what "thirst" means in Scripture, that which is characteristic of man naturally. It is not only unsatisfied, but irregular desire. It takes irregular lines, not the lines that God intended. It is lust in the principle of it. But what you have to meet that is the Spirit; the Spirit is to spring up in order to emancipate the person; as Paul says in @Romans 8, "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death". You see, even with a woman such as you get in chapter 4, there is no doubt that she has affections, but then her desires were taking irregular direction. It was to emancipate her from this that the Lord promises the "well of water springing up into everlasting life".
But now the point in chapter 5 is that the Father is brought to you, not you to the Father. In chapter 4 the well of water springs up -- Christ becomes the Object of affection to you. It is in that way that you get everything corrected -- all affections take their proper place and course, and in that way you get emancipation. Then in chapter 5 Christ brings the Father to you when He says, "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work". He was only presenting the Father, for "the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that himself doeth", and what the Father was doing, the Son was doing likewise.
Ques. What are the "greater works" (verse 20)?
F.E.R. Well, there were much greater works to be done than raising up a lame man. The works which come out in this chapter are dispensational works; for instance, the raising up of Israel in the future is a dispensational work, but the works which are "greater" are not dispensational. There are works which the Father does which are outside all dispensations.
{59}
Ques. Is what verse 25 brings before us a *moral* raising up of the dead?
F.E.R. Yes, quite so.
Ques. Would not the judgment be, in a way, one of the greater works?
F.E.R. The Lord only brings in judgment incidentally. Even that is coming in on the line of dispensations, but it is for the purpose of securing the honour of the Son. It is a greater work, in a sense, than raising up the man at the pool.
Rem. The work at Pentecost was greater.
F.E.R. Yes. At Pentecost the work was outside the course of dispensations, and the church is properly outside of them.
Ques. Would you say that all the signs are in connection with the dispensations?
F.E.R. Yes. They were according to what the Jews might have understood -- what might have come within the range of their knowledge; but in each of the signs the great point is that the Lord uses them as a peg upon which to hang something greater.
Rem. It comes out very markedly in chapter 6.
F.E.R. Quite so. "Moses gave you not that bread from heaven", and the bread with which He had fed the multitudes was not the bread from heaven. "My Father giveth you the true bread". Chapter 6 completes the testimony. There you get the appropriation of the death of Christ, and Christ as Priest, and that brings you deliverance from the whole system in which flesh lives. You must have chapter 6 or you would not have the testimony completed.
Ques. What is the intent of bringing the revelation of the Father to you?
F.E.R. Well, if you take as an illustration the conditions of human life, as far as I know, they are three -- you must have water, light and bread; and you get these three things in these three chapters. There are very few people who could get on without
{60}
them -- in fact, *none*. If you shut up a man in prison darkness and deprive him of bread and water, you would soon make an end of him, and I think it is the same in regard to our life spiritually. There is water in chapter 4, light in chapter 5, and the bread in chapter 6. These chapters bring out all that is necessary to meet the conditions of life.
One point is that you are no longer in the light of "Jehovah", or of "the Almighty". You have the light of both, but you go beyond this -- you have the light of "the Father". The great thing is that it is the revelation of God in His nature. "The Father loves the Son" -- it is God revealed in His nature. "Almighty" is not God revealed in His nature, it is one of His attributes; neither is "Jehovah", which brings out what God is in His eternal faithfulness -- "the Eternal", as it is rendered in the French. But when you come to the revelation of "the Father", it is God in His nature -- "The Father loveth the Son". I do not think it could come out until there was an adequate object here, but when the Son became Man, then the love of God could come out, there was an Object adequate.
Ques. God is spoken of as light and love. Is it the whole of His nature which is contained in those two statements?
F.E.R. Well, I would not exactly speak of light as being the nature of God. The nature of God is summed up in one word, and that is *love* -- "God is love". *Light* means that everything is detected, but the nature of God is *love*. That is what is characteristic of Him.
Ques. Would you say that the Father was working with a view to this coming out -- in view of the divine affections coming out?
F.E.R. I think so. God, in the revelation of His nature, was to pervade all, but until the Son became Man it could not be declared, there was no means.
{61}
See how it works out -- the Father loves the Son, and then the Son had affections towards those whom the Father drew to Him. The Father's love reached to the disciples through the Son, and the Son had affection for them as those whom the Father had drawn to Him.
Rem. It shows unity of purpose and nature.
F.E.R. Yes; and in that way the Father's love descended to them, and in One who Himself had part in the love of God, and who alone knew it. No one but a divine Person could declare the love of God.
Rem. It gives great force to the word, "The Father loveth the Son".
F.E.R. Yes; and in that sense every work was the outcome of love. The revelation is the declaring of the Father -- of God. What the Lord is bringing out is the light in which our souls are to live, not just a power within us to emancipate us from this or that, but the light in which we are to live, and we must have the light of the Father's revelation. The names of "Almighty" and "Jehovah" had failed to hold man, but now you get another thing, most important, coming out here, and that is the light before which a man can be entirely and completely subdued. It is the love of God that subdues a man, but light is the accompaniment of love, because if God shines out, everything is detected in the light of God -- detected and exposed -- and light and love thus work together, they are inseparable.
Rem. The light not only subdues, but it satisfies.
F.E.R. Yes, it does. This chapter seems to me to be the most profound in Scripture -- that is the idea I have of it. To attempt any kind of exposition of it is a most difficult task. The Lord here undertook to declare the terms on which He was with the Father, and what His presence down here meant -- what was really expressed in His Person down here. Who can open that out?
The force of verse 19 is that the Father was not
{62}
doing anything which the Son was not doing too. The marvellous thing to me is this -- I do not quite know how to put it -- that God Himself comes down and really anticipates the judgment that lay upon man. God Himself comes into the judgment in the Person of the Son, into all that lay upon man, and, in the very fact of coming into it, it is annulled, and nothing is left but the light, and that light is to be the life of our souls.
I think we may have looked at Christ too exclusively as the sacrifice, and have lost sight of Him as a divine Person who came forth, and who, having entered into death, brings into it the testimony of God -- the light of God. The other side comes in, of course, He did offer Himself a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savour, but in holding to that side, it does not do to overlook the other. He brings into death the testimony of God, He anticipates our judgment. We were under death and the curse, but Christ has come and anticipated them, and they are annulled by the fact of a divine Person coming into them. And what is left? Why, the light is left, that it may be the life of our souls. God Himself is revealed in it; the testimony of God comes out in the death of Christ. It did not come out in its completeness in the life, but in death. So God sends forth His Son to redeem. Redemption was accomplished, but at the same time God is revealed, the light of God is brought into death.
Rem. "If we walk in the *light*, as he is in the *light*, we have fellowship one with another, and the *blood* of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin".
Ques. What about "The hour is coming, and now is", etc. (verse 25)?
F.E.R. Well, but it is because He has come into death that you hear the voice. You hear it in the place of death. It is in that place that you hear the "voice of the Son of God". He could not remain in
{63}
it because He had life in Himself. It is in the apprehension that He has come down to where we were in the eyes of God -- every one was under death -- that we hear the voice, and those that hear shall live.
Rem. It is beautifully illustrated in the parable of the good Samaritan -- he came down to where the man was.
F.E.R. Yes, it is most striking. He came as a divine Person to accomplish a divine work, and then, when accomplished, He went back: "again, I leave the world, and go to the Father". And you get the same thought again in @Hebrews 1, "when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high".
Ques. When it speaks of the Father showing Him all things, it is "the Son", but further down it is the "Son of God". What is that?
F.E.R. "Son of God" indicates that He has become Man, it is the title under which He is revealed; the title could not exist until He became Man. When it speaks of what He is eternally, it is "the Son", in distinction to "the Father", but as Man, He is the "Son of God". Who but a divine Person was coming to reveal the Father to us? Who could take up the Father's works and say that the Father showed to Him all that Himself was doing? Who could know that but the Son? An angel might come from God and kill thousands of Syrians at a stroke, but that was not the presentation of God; he was but obeying the commands of God, as we should do, but it is a very different thing here, the Son presents the Father.
Ques. The Son presents the Father in His love?
F.E.R. Yes, that is just the point: "The only-begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him". In one sense He never left the bosom of the Father, but yet He comes out from it in order to declare God in His nature -- not simply in His power or righteousness, but in His love. There
{64}
was nothing that the Father did which the Son was not doing, and he that saw the Son saw the Father.
Ques. Is verse 21 a moral statement or actual?
F.E.R. It is not raising men up to judgment, but quickening them, making them live. It was not the pleasure of the Father -- the work of the Father -- to bring them up to judgment. It takes in the whole thing -- body and all. Raising up men for judgment only comes into the passage incidentally to secure the honour of the Son.
Ques. Why do you think it puts "raiseth" first?
F.E.R. Well, it looks upon men as actually dead, but the Son quickens whom He will; it does not say "raises" in regard to Him. Then it looks on to the coming of the Lord. He comes out in that light -- He quickens; He comes in that way in regard to all here. That is what Christ will do when He comes. "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive".
Rem. In chapter 11 He says, "I am the resurrection, and the life".
F.E.R. Yes. But then He goes on to say, "He that ... liveth and believeth in me shall never die". They will not be *raised*, but they must be made alive. We get it in a spiritual sense now, but quickening, in the strict sense, applies to the body, because death came in on the body. "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive".
I think Christians would be very wonderful people if they were really in the light of this chapter -- really living in the light of the Father. It is not so much the light of Christ's glory here, but really the light of the Father. We have had the revelation of Christ, and the power of the Spirit, but in this chapter He brings in the light of the Father. He is the Son of the Father, and He brings in the light of the Father. It is, "Is not this the Christ?" in the previous chapter, but this chapter is the distinctive testimony of the last Adam. The last Adam is the Son of God, who comes
{65}
(in order that He may be the last Adam) into death itself, and He annuls the power of death, and takes up the position of last Adam in resurrection, and becomes a life-giving Spirit. He has brought into death the full light of God. "Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness".
Ques. Is the order of these chapters similar to that of @Romans 6 and 7?
F.E.R. Well, I do not know if you could make John run with Paul in that way. Chapter 4 runs more with @Romans 8 in taking up the state side, but I am sure I do not know where to put @John 5, although it connects itself, in a way, with @Romans 8. You see, John deals so exclusively with the *state* side, but Romans with our *responsibility*.
Ques. Why do you say He brings into *death* the blessed light of God?
F.E.R. Well, where do you get the testimony except in death? It is there you get the full testimony of God's love. God appeals to you in that way.
Ques. Would you say that in verse 24 a man is viewed as "in Christ Jesus", where there is no condemnation?
F.E.R. Oh, but there is more than that. It is not simply that there is no condemnation, but it is the kind of people who have passed out of death into life -- into the new region.
Ques. Is "in Christ Jesus" "passed out of death into life"?
F.E.R. Yes. But then the extent of it there (in @Romans 8) is only that they have "no condemnation". Here it is, "not come into judgment, but is passed out of death into life". It is more positive. John is so extremely comprehensive. We get a somewhat analogous statement in the epistle, "We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren". Death and life stand in the strongest possible contrast in John. Death is where Satan
{66}
acts -- life is where God is revealed and known. It is all darkness and death in Satan's sphere, but on the other side all the light of God had come out, and it is life, "The life was the light of men".
Ques. Verse 24 does not apply to a soul in his responsibility?
F.E.R. No, that is not the point.
Rem. But this verse has been used much by the evangelist to that end.
F.E.R. Yes. But he has given that up now, I think. It was used to give people an idea of security, a kind of short way out to security, and it has failed, therefore, to give to people what it was intended to convey, and people, too, were deceived by it. What it means is this, the Lord has brought out the light, and the effect of it is that "he that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me" does not come into judgment, but is passed out of death into life. The reason why he has passed out of death into life is because he has passed out of darkness into light. I think His "word" is more the revelation, not just the works He had done, but the revelation of the Father.
Ques. What is the force of "hath everlasting life"?
F.E.R. The point is, I think, that he has reached it in that way, and it is that kind of person who has it. It is the one who hears the voice of the Son of God. There are certain people in the world who have eternal life, and they are thus characterised.
Ques. The one characterised by hearing the voice of the Son of God?
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. The moment has not come for bringing eternal life dispensationally into the world. If it were, you would not want this sort of knowledge to discern those who have it. As the psalm says, "There Jehovah commanded the blessing, even life for evermore"; but what marks the present
{67}
moment is that certain people in the world have eternal life, and they are marked by hearing the voice of the Son of God, and believing His word.
Ques. What is the difference between verses 24 and 25?
F.E.R. Well, I think that the "voice of the Son of God" indicates that He Himself has come into death, so that the dead might hear Him -- that is what it conveys to me. He comes within the range of the dead, comes into what was upon man. He does not remain there, He could not be holden of death, but He comes into it and brings into it the testimony of God, and those who hear His voice live.
Ques. And then they follow Him?
F.E.R. Yes. But the first thing is, they must live. You could not follow until you live. It is not responsibility in this chapter, but life; neither is it in chapter 10. When they follow Him, they do what is congenial and natural, "I know my sheep, and am known of mine". Then, too, they "go in and out, and find pasture". It is privilege.
There are two steps -- "The dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live". If you want to know them, it is characteristic of those that live that they "hear the voice of the Son of God". It is in that way that they are detected. They hear the word of Christ -- it is in that way that they get life. I think that the first moment that they begin to live is when the love of God is discerned. That is, as it were, the first breath, and you must have breath as a sign of life. With a new-born babe the first mark of life is a breath, and so it is spiritually. In the beginning, when God created man, He "breathed into his nostrils ... and man became a living soul". And what man ever breathes spiritually until he has the light of the love of God?
Now Christ has really brought into death the testimony of God's love -- if you can understand the
{68}
expression. He has really come into that circle -- broken through the fence -- and brought in there the testimony of God's love, and the moment a person apprehends that he begins to breathe to God. That is life.
Ques. The Son hath "life in himself". Does that refer to resurrection?
F.E.R. Well, He could not be holden of death. It is only a divine Person who could have life in Himself. It refers to the place He has taken as Man, that it is said to be "given" to Him. Here you have the incarnate Son on earth, and everything is looked upon as given to Him. He takes the character of receiving everything from the Father in this gospel, even things that properly belong to Him, as in the words, "Glorify thou me ... with the glory which I had with thee before the world was", chapter 17.
"All that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth". He carries the thought out to its fullest limit and boundary. "They that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment". It is not simply that He exercises quickening power on those that believe, but He carries it out to the utmost boundary of death. It is all put on that kind of moral ground so as to cover everybody.
CHAPTER 5: 25 TO END
F.E.R. We were speaking last week of the dead hearing the voice of the Son of God, and that those who heard lived. I believe the thought is that the Son of God comes as low as the dead, so that they might hear His voice.
Ques. So that those who were in death might hear Him?
F.E.R. Yes. What I mean is that He goes down
{69}
into death to bring into death the testimony of God's love, as you get in @Romans 5, "God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us". The voice of the Son of God speaks from the dead in that way, and the dead hear, and they that hear, live. The dead hearing the voice of the Son of God indicates to me that He goes among them, so that His voice may be heard.
Ques. It is not quite like quickening, is it?
F.E.R. Well, it is hearing His voice. He does quicken, of course.
Ques. When would you say it is heard?
F.E.R. Well, it is when a person apprehends really what it meant for Him to come into death. It is then when the dead hear. "Voice" is a very difficult expression when applied to divine Persons. It is a human figure applied to divine Persons. The dead are those who are under the judgment of God -- it is the place where they were, and it is there that He speaks. It is His voice expressing the love of God to man: "The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given unto us. For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.... God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us".
Ques. Does this include new birth?
F.E.R. Well, the Lord is not taking up the divine side now, but the human side.
Ques. Do you mean that He has previously in this chapter taken up the divine side?
F.E.R. Yes: "As the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will". Later on He speaks on the other side; it is to the dead here, it is our side. We have the two sides in that way -- one side is God's activity and working, and the other side presents what the dead hear: "the voice of the Son of God".
{70}
Ques. Does not "the voice of the Son of God" go altogether beyond new birth?
F.E.R. Yes. He quickens, and quickening goes beyond new birth a great deal. It really goes on to the raising of the body. The point is that His voice ministers to you an impression, and the question is what impression has the voice made upon you?
Rem. Yes, I see that we have confined it -- at least I have -- too much to certain words spoken.
F.E.R. But it is a very much wider thing than that. He spoke when He was here upon earth, but, to my mind, His voice in *death* has much more significance than when He was here. It is that side of it that comes out in these verses. He had spoken in regard to the divine working, "My Father worketh hitherto and I work" -- the Son working in line with the Father, and in the communion of the Father -- but now He takes up the other side. It is not new birth or quickening, but the impression of the voice of the Son of God upon the soul. If you ask when a person lives to God, I can tell you, with positive certainty, that it is when the soul apprehends the love of God. That moment the soul begins to live to God.
Ques. Is it like the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than Abel's?
F.E.R. Well, morally it is so. It is analogous to that.
Ques. Is it as we say sometimes, "It speaks volumes"?
F.E.R. Yes, that is it, exactly.
Rem. It puts an entirely new colour on these verses.
F.E.R. Well, do not take it upon my word simply. It is a great thing to be orthodox, you know. I ask any one, what peculiar significance to you has the voice of the Son of God? Just as I might say, What is the voice of Isaiah to you, or of Jeremiah? Each prophet has a certain significant voice. I think the
{71}
"voice" of the prophet is the predominating idea in that prophet, but now we have come to someone better than a prophet, and what is the predominating idea in the voice of the Son of God? Well, without doubt, the great idea in His "voice" is the presentation of the love of God. That is the "voice of the Son of God" to me -- it is what is peculiar to Himself.
Rem. You can well see it in the case of the prophets.
F.E.R. Yes. Each prophet had his own peculiar significance. He had a "voice" in that way; and the "voice of the Son of God" had its own significance too.
Rem. John the Baptist speaks of himself as being a "voice".
F.E.R. Yes. And it was a voice that was peculiar to himself. It was the voice of the one who came before Christ. Now the Son of God has a voice, and when that voice is apprehended in the soul, then that soul *lives* -- "They that hear shall *live*". It is that you come into the region of life, you "pass out of death into life". The region of life is where God is, and where God is revealed.
Rem. It is a very great transition from death into life.
F.E.R. Yes, it is. I think the idea is that you pass into a new scene, a new region.
Ques. Who are the "dead"?
F.E.R. Oh, I think *all*. The Lord comes into a scene of death: "If one died for all, then were all dead". All are dead before the eye of God, but here it is that you wake up out of death, and then you pass out of death into life; you pass out from under the judgment of God into all the full light of God. It involves a tremendous passage for a soul.
Ques. There are two ways in which a man is "dead", are there not?
F.E.R. Yes. Death is on man; the judgment of God stands between God and man. God imposed
{72}
that sentence upon man, and it stands between them. You are not literally relieved yet of death, but between God and a man's own soul it is gone. I feel we should be better able to talk of these things if we were more in them. I believe the great difficulty in accepting these things is that we are not in them. You cannot talk about a thing that you are not in.
Ques. What is the connection between all this and His having "authority to execute judgment", etc.?
F.E.R. It is to show that His authority extends to all. His rights, having become Son of man, have to be extended over all. If it had been a question simply that those who heard "lived", it would have meant that He would have nothing to say, in a sense, to the others. They would have continued under the judgment, but then judgment must be executed, and that is given to the Son, "that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father".
Rem. But that is the "Son of God".
F.E.R. Yes. But then it shows farther on that He has authority to execute judgment, "because he is the Son of man". He has been presented to man in that form, and the crucial point between God and man is Christ. The One who is rejected in the world is not exactly God, but *Christ*. Men will tolerate the idea of God -- they have not given up the idea of God yet, they are not prepared for that -- but I think that every one of us must be conscious that *Christ* is rejected among men. These people shut themselves out from all hope if they will not accept this Man; they really shut out the possibility of God presenting Himself to man. I think it is a very extraordinary thing for a man to assume the absolute impossibility of God presenting Himself to man, and yet, as you know, men do assume it.
Ques. Next we come to the resurrection of the body, do we not?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. "The hour is coming, in
{73}
the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice". There is a very great difference between the voice that speaks now and the one that will speak then, and yet it is the voice of the same Person. The character of the "voice" will be altogether different. The effect in the one case is "living" -- it is moral; but the effect in the other case is resurrection -- an actual physical effect; and I think you will always find -- it is a principle with God -- that the physical follows the moral, the physical is subordinated to the moral. I believe you will find it a principle all through Scripture. God is bringing about at the present time certain moral results, but it will be followed by the physical.
Rem. It is so in the case of the palsied man. He first says, "Thy sins be forgiven thee", and then, "Take up thy bed, and walk".
F.E.R. Yes. The Lord settles the moral question first, and then He raises up the man, and the resurrection of the man is the proof and testimony to the moral -- you see *life*. The Lord calls it here "the resurrection of life", and "the resurrection of judgment". You see, life really demands resurrection. How are you going to carry it out, how is life going to be made good, if there is no resurrection? He evidently has not got it this side of death, and on the other hand, if a man is to be judged he must be judged in his body, for a man is not a man apart from his body. Now if neither judgment nor life comes in on this side of death, then both judgment and life demand resurrection.
Rem. "If the dead rise not, we are of all men most miserable".
F.E.R. Quite so. There may be a suspended state of existence, but a man is not properly a man apart from his body. As the Lord said to the Sadducees, "God is not the God of the dead, but of the living". They had died as regards men, but they lived for
{74}
God, and the Lord brings that forward as a proof of resurrection. If you are prepared to give up the thought of life or of judgment, then I can understand you will not want the thought of resurrection, but I think you would be reduced to a curious position. Just think of a man being really formed, by the Spirit of God, in the divine nature, and the whole thing terminating in death! he never actually lives at all. And then, too, think of this world of confusion -- the wicked prospering, and the evil really triumphing over the good -- and yet that there should never be any kind of moral solution! You are reduced to a most extraordinary position if you look at it apart from Scripture. If it is such a scene of confusion to you, what must it be to God -- and yet to have no solution of it! But here you get the solution of it -- they hear the voice of the Son of God, "and come forth; they that have done good unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of judgment". The Lord puts it on moral ground, too, and not on the ground of faith or unbelief, or anything of that, but "they that have done *good*", or "*evil*". No system of faith sets aside the simple question of right or wrong. It is not put in here as an actually occurring event -- as far as that goes, there is no *time* specified, though in the mind of God the day is fixed -- but it is *moral*. Life has its resurrection, and judgment has its resurrection -- each thought has its resurrection.
Ques. In what sense is it, "They that have done good"?
F.E.R. It is maintaining the great principles of good and evil in the world. If a man does evil, then judgment will overtake that. The Lord puts it specially on moral ground so as to maintain the immutable principles of right and wrong, of good and evil.
Rem. Like as in @Romans 2, he that does good is approved of God.
F.E.R. Yes, and so Paul puts it elsewhere, "I
{75}
know that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and of the unjust". You see, if you go back to Old Testament times, there were no "Christians" then, and yet men did good. Wherever a man had light from God, he did good. How is it possible for a man to do good who has not light from God?
Ques. Then it is not a question of conversion?
F.E.R. Well, it involves it, but a man could not do good apart from God. You would make a man independent of God if it were possible to do good without light from God.
Rem. No dispensation sets aside the principles on which God acts.
F.E.R. No; there are immutable principles on which God acts. The fact is, that every bit of good that has been wrought in this world on the part of man is the effect of his getting light from God. Men are not very good judges of right and wrong; they have made themselves a god superior to revelation. The fact is, they have no god at all except one out of their own imaginations or reasoning. You may conjure up a god -- an intelligent man may do that -- but, after all, the real basis of it must rest upon what light he has got from the Bible. He cannot help being affected by the Bible if he has been brought up under the influence of it, and though his mind may conjure up a god which he considers superior to what is found in Scripture, it is really based upon what light he has obtained from Scripture.
Rem. Yes, and outside Scripture you get the hideous things of India and other heathen places.
F.E.R. For my part, I do not want to follow scientific men. They have got no god, or only one conjured up by their own mind. If you have not got revelation, you have no god at all. These men have only got an idea of God which their own minds have conceived.
{76}
Now I think from this point the Lord passes on to another ground -- it is the ground of *conviction*. He brings forward the various testimonies which left the people without excuse (verse 30). You will see that the point was that He was not simply speaking as a man down here -- "I can of mine own self do nothing, as I hear, I judge", and then, "I seek not mine own will". His judgment and His will, in that sense, both came from above; they did not find their source even in Himself. It was not a man speaking here from his own mind, but it was bringing down here into this scene the light of what was above. He was morally perfect Himself too.
Ques. He was the only One fit to judge, because He had no will. "As I hear" refers to what He heard above, not what He might hear and form an opinion on?
F.E.R. Oh, no, I do not think so. It is, "As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me". He could have no will apart from the Father. "The Father loves the Son", and though man could not accept or believe it, there it was, "As I hear, I judge". I often think they must have been struck with the certainty of the Lord's words. It was not a man just indulging in platitudes, but there was a certain distinctness about what He said. He spake "as one having authority". "We speak that we do *know*, and testify that we have *seen*".
Then He goes on to say, "If I bear witness of myself my witness is not true", because if He had borne witness to Himself, He would have isolated Himself from the Deity. He would have made Himself a separate and distinct Person. But the truth is, the Lord never did a work, or said a word, that did not involve the whole Trinity, as He said, "The words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works". And anyone who knows anything about Scripture can
{77}
see that everything the Lord did and said was in the power of the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit does not testify to Himself. The Lord really takes here, if I might say so, the place of the vessel of the testimony.
Rem. In chapter 8 He says, "I am one that bear witness of myself".
F.E.R. Yes. In that way He could bear witness of Himself, but not as an independent Person in the Godhead.
Rem. And the very fact of His testifying of Himself in that passage is to bring out the Father -- "If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also".
F.E.R. Yes, exactly. The point here is that He did not take any place but that of a Vessel. He refuses the place of being the Source, and in taking the place of the Vessel He was true to that place.
Ques. In verse 32 is the "another" the Father?
F.E.R. It is not "another" in the sense of a different one, but He says, I am conscious "that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true".
Ques. Is that the Father?
F.E.R. I imagine so.
Ques. Not John the Baptist?
F.E.R. Oh, no. I do not think the Lord would have said He was conscious that the witness was true if it had been the witness of John. And then, too, He goes on to say, "Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth. But I receive not testimony from man". I should suppose that in verse 32 He refers to the Father, that is one witness, and then He speaks of the works as bearing witness, and then to the Scriptures -- three witnesses.
Ques. Was the witness of the Father what was spoken from heaven?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. I think He refers to that further on when He says, "The Father himself ... hath borne witness of me".
Ques. Does it make man more responsible?
{78}
F.E.R. Yes. It was not a question simply of their refusing Himself, but that the full presentation of God was refused. You will constantly find through John's gospel that the rejection meant the rejection of God. "Now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father". There remained but one thing more to be done, and that was to reject the Holy Spirit, and that was done in the case of Stephen. "As your fathers did, so do ye". They resisted the final testimony in that way.
Ques. Is it from "man" or from "the man" (verse 34)?
F.E.R. It is "the man" -- evidently referring to John's testimony. It is plain that man could not bear testimony to God. Christ was Himself the testimony. It would be equivalent to saying that God could not bear adequate testimony to Himself. We do not need testimony, for example, about the *sun*. If a man were to ask for testimony about the *sun*, you would think he was out of his mind. So in regard to Christ, if He could not make Himself felt, then it was no good men bearing testimony to Him. You find it constantly coming out in the earlier part of this gospel; "Come and see". The point was to "Come and see" the One who was there before their eyes and needing no testimony.
Rem. In verse 35 John bears witness to the truth, and yet the Lord does not receive testimony from man. I do not quite understand the two verses.
F.E.R. The point is this -- they would have to believe in Christ on His own testimony, not on John's. So, too, a man may preach to you at the present time about Christ, but if you are going to believe in Christ, it must be on His own testimony. A man never really believes in Christ until he cannot help it. He believes in Christ because he cannot help believing.
Ques. John's testimony was not set aside, was it?
F.E.R. No. But John's testimony was not on the
{79}
ground of faith. People were exercised by his ministry, but Christ Himself was the ground of faith. So at the present day, you do not simply believe on Christ on the word of the preacher. If you do, your faith will not stand, that is certain. Christ appeals to certain moral necessities in the soul of a man, and he is shut up to the work of God -- the work is entirely of God.
Ques. Is Moses brought in as a witness?
F.E.R. No. I think He simply brings Moses in for conviction. They were hoping in Moses (verse 45), and the Lord takes them up on that ground. "Had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me". What is so striking is that He really seems to put the Scriptures as more authoritative than His own words. "If ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?"
Ques. We have generally heard that there is a fourfold testimony here. Do you go with that?
F.E.R. Well, it is so in a way. There is His own testimony, and then the Father's testimony, then that of John the Baptist, and then that of the Scriptures. The effect of the whole passage, and it was necessary that the Lord should speak thus to them, is to leave them entirely without excuse.
Ques. But if the Lord did not receive testimony from man?
F.E.R. Well, the Lord Himself, in a certain sense, was the sum of all testimony. If John bore testimony, it was simply by the power and grace of Christ. He could not bear witness otherwise.
Ques. Is "witness" the same idea as testifying?
F.E.R. Oh, yes, I think so. It is very solemn to think that, although they would not receive His testimony, they will receive the "man of sin". "If another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive". The truth is that Christ appeals to certain moral necessities of man, and Antichrist will appeal to certain lusts of man, and, therefore, you see man
{80}
receives Antichrist much more readily than he would Christ; and how people are deceived by these things -- how they run after them. The whole system of the world adapts itself to some lust in man, and when Antichrist comes he will just appeal to some desire of man for greatness, or glory, or such like. The very principle which led the people to reject Christ is really Antichrist.
CHAPTER 6: 1 - 40
F.E.R. In chapter 4 we noted the communication of the Spirit, and the well of water springing up into eternal life; then in chapter 5 we get the voice of the Son of God and what that voice implies, and now, in this chapter, we get living bread.
Ques. And that is connected with the Son of man?
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. The contrast between chapters 5 and 6 lies in this -- that in the former we have the *Son of God's* part, as it were. He is there presenting God, but now in this chapter He comes within the range of man's appropriation, on *man's* part. In chapter 5 it was, "The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live" -- that is what I understand to be speaking on *God's* part, but when He comes as living bread, He gives life to the world, that is on our side. Grace brings Him within the range of our appropriation -- eating is appropriation in that way -- grace brings the Son of God within the range of man's appropriation. He has become the Son of man to that end. Hence the great idea in the chapter is *food* -- that which sustains. It is not *light*, as in the previous chapter, but that which sustains and supports. "My flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed".
Ques. It is more what He becomes, would you say?
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. It is not a mighty voice
{81}
speaking as in chapter 5, bringing light to man from God -- here it is quite the other side. So the chapter opens with the feeding of the multitude. The two miracles which introduce the two chapters are important -- the palsied man raised up in a moment by the word of Christ, and here the feeding of the multitude.
Rem. It is interesting to see how John illustrates, in that way, what he puts forth.
Rem. This chapter supposes life, and brings in what is necessary to sustain it.
F.E.R. I think you must take these three chapters together, no one of them gives you the truth completely. Each one gives its own teaching, but you must take the three together.
Rem. They do not repeat one another in any way.
F.E.R. No. And each one is essential, and you cannot do without it. It is not a question of the grace of God, or a man getting the forgiveness of his sins, but the point in these chapters is *life*.
Ques. In what aspect is Christ Himself presented as the Bread? In what way is He the Bread?
F.E.R. It is Christ Himself the portion of man's heart. There are two great ideas in the chapter: His death and His priesthood -- that is, for the full support of man, of the believer. "He that eateth me, even he shall live by me" -- that is priesthood. The people say, "This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world", but then He goes up on high as a Priest, and then the word is, "He that eateth me, even he shall live by me". That is where priesthood comes in. The Priest has reference to all that Christ is on our side. He is the Mediator on God's side, but on our side He is the Priest.
Ques. Then Mediator and Priest are two quite different ideas?
F.E.R. Oh, yes, totally different. Mediator is from God to man, while Priest is what He is on our side Godward.
{82}
Rem. In the previous chapter He comes out as Apostle.
F.E.R. Yes. But He really comes out as last Adam. It is from God to man in life-giving power; so He raises the dead -- it is the power of God acting upon man. But this chapter stands in the greatest possible contrast to that; here He has taken such a course as to put Himself within the range of man's appropriation.
Rem. I suppose the first step is incarnation, and then He comes into death -- gives His life for the life of the world.
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. Does not this chapter give Christ as the manna?
F.E.R. Well, He uses the manna as a contrast. He is in contrast with the manna. "This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and *not* die". He does not use the manna as a type, but rather in contrast. The whole question here is not the wilderness, for which the manna was suited, but *life* -- that is, in the latter part of the chapter.
All the miracles in John are of very great moment. They are not introduced in the ordinary way of miracles at all, simply as an expression of the goodness of God to men, as in the other gospels -- for instance, in Luke, "Who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him". In the gospel of John they are undoubtedly "signs" -- they all bear witness to the One who did the miracles. You lose the force of the miracles in John if you do not apprehend them in that light.
Rem. When He turned water into wine, it says, "This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory".
F.E.R. Yes, and undoubtedly the raising up of the man in chapter 5 has that same force.
{83}
Ques. You would connect that principle with all the miracles in John?
F.E.R. Yes, I would. Take the raising of Lazarus -- He says, "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby". They were all reflective, they bore witness to the One who did the miracles.
Ques. How do you reconcile the Bread and the Priest? The Bread came down out of heaven.
F.E.R. But if He had not become a Man, He could not be a Priest. Feeding is simply a figure of appropriation. You make the food your own. "The bread ... is he which cometh down from heaven". You could not have an efficient priest except One come down from heaven. The fact is that the Priest must come down from heaven as well as the Mediator. Man has nothing at all for God, and even on man's side all must come down from heaven.
One undoubted feature of the gospel of John is the complete ignoring of all that went before. It is a new point of departure, and not a part of anything that had been.
Ques. He is still the living bread come down from heaven?
F.E.R. Yes; it is characteristic of Him. There are two expressions used: "cometh down from heaven" -- that is characteristic, but "I came down from heaven" is historical. This is what actually occurred.
Rem. That was because He alone could conduct us into eternal life.
F.E.R. Yes. It is not simply a man raised up down here, but He is going to lead you in; and in order to be led in, you must have what came down from heaven. "In the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee". Well, that comes down from heaven.
Rem. The fact is, the Priest must die.
{84}
F.E.R. Exactly; eating His flesh and drinking His blood means that I die too -- it is the appropriation of His death. It is my death experimentally, in the sense of deliverance. It has been pointed out that the miracle is a fulfilment of @Psalm 132, "I will satisfy her poor with bread".
Ques. Is there a difference between "He that eateth me, even he shall live by me", and eating His flesh and drinking His blood?
F.E.R. They are manifestly two distinct ideas, but we are a little anticipating. You see, His death is deliverance to the one who appropriates it. It results in the deliverance of the soul from the whole course and system of things in which the flesh lives, but then that is only one side. Deliverance must come in, but you also want someone to conduct you into what is heavenly, and that is where the Priest comes in.
Ques. I thought the verse referred to Christ as incarnate -- "the living bread which came down from heaven"?
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. But the question of place does not come in. I think the prominent idea in the passage is not the *place*, but the *Person*. If you come to the question of place, as Paul would look at it, He is at the right hand of God, but John does not look at it in quite the same way. Of course you could not take up priesthood officially on earth, but you get the principle. The Lord was a Priest to those about Him, that is, His disciples, not officially, perhaps, but He was so virtually. He was their stay and support, and I think He is that to us now.
Rem. When He prayed for Peter, that was a priestly act.
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. You get the principle of the thing there. I have said that you could not understand the assembly at all if you do not see what Christ was here upon earth in the midst of His own, and yet, of course, you do not get the assembly before Pentecost --
{85}
no one would pretend that for a moment. I think it comes out very markedly in the Lord's supper. The very first participation of the Supper was when the Lord was in the midst. You have to distinguish between a position taken and what He was morally.
Rem. That is interesting to me, for it had often been a point to me His having prayed for Peter.
Rem. And He speaks of Himself as the Comforter -- at least He speaks of "another Comforter" as though He Himself were one.
F.E.R. Yes, He does. And you must bear in mind that John does not recognise the old system -- everything is completely new; nothing that went before is recognised.
Ques. You mean He does not recognise the old Levitical law?
F.E.R. Yes; everything is new. In the previous chapter He says, "The hour is coming, and now is". He gives a present application to what had not yet strictly come in.
Rem. That clears up many difficulties, I feel.
F.E.R. Well, people have tried to construe the thing in a kind of literal way, but they only mar it.
Now this passage is introduced with the testimony of the feeding of the multitude. It is a witness to Christ as a divine Person. All that God had predicted with regard to Israel was really there, and, just as in the previous chapter, this had been witnessed to by the raising of the palsied man, so here you get another principle testified to, that is, perfect administration. He uses the bread that was there, and His disciples share with Him in the distribution of it to the people. It is a picture of perfect administration.
Ques. It is a picture of millennial times?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. I often think if I were not a Christian I should be a really awful man. When I see the inequalities of the world, the dark contrast between the intense poverty and great luxury -- dreadful
{86}
poverty, grinding poverty -- it afflicts me tremendously, and if I had not the sense that God knows better than I do, if I had not the check of being a Christian, I should just be an out-and-out radical. But I have no doubt that God knows how to modify things in reference to people. With the world as it is I have not a vestige of sympathy. What I mean is that, with the Lord in His rightful place, you will get perfect administration coming in, and you will not have these inequalities. When He was here, they had "bread enough and to spare", and when He comes to administer things, you will not have the enormous inequalities which exist now.
Rem. It could not be, for we read that every man is to sit under his own vine and fig-tree.
F.E.R. I believe that God will strike a fatal blow at all the great commercial system, as we see it growing now. It is as evident as possible, from the prophets, that God will strike a blow at Tyre -- the symbol of commercial activity. The proper function of ordinary government here is to protect life and property, but if they were to attempt to equalise things now, they would bring about only the direst confusion. It is beyond man -- only God can effect it.
Ques. Why did not the Lord allow them to make Him a king?
F.E.R. Well, He would not allow Himself to be made a king by the will of man; and, besides, man was not to be trusted. The very same people that would have made Him a king today would crucify Him tomorrow. There will be no question of His right to be king when He comes again. They would not accept Him as the Son, and they could not, therefore, receive Him in any other way, "He received from God the Father honour and glory". His glory is that He is Son, and it was not even the Father *conferring* anything upon Him, but recognising what belonged to Him. I think it was a mere momentary impression
{87}
with these Jews. They were affected by the miracle for a moment, but it was the mere conviction of the human mind.
Rem. And depended a good deal upon the fact of their appetite being satisfied.
F.E.R. Yes, quite so.
Ques. Is there any special reason for connecting this with @Psalm 132?
F.E.R. Well, it shows the fulfilment of that psalm, or, more correctly, a sample of the fulfilment of it, and not only that, but it contained in it a much more general idea. It really refers to millennial good, but the power was in the Person -- it was a testimony to the Person. It is not only the miracle, but the manner of the miracle, the way in which the miracle was carried out, that was a testimony to the Lord. He connected it all with heaven, teaching that heaven was the real source of blessing and good for man.
Ques. Was His position on a mountain alone a figure of His present position?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. He refuses to be made a king by the will of man, but then He goes up on high, a figure of the priestly place He now occupies.
Rem. I suppose the kingdom could not be on a stable foundation except by death.
F.E.R. No. Death was essential, and so it is said, "He tasted death for everything". His death is a most wonderful thing to me, not simply in the sacrificial aspect of it, but in that it was the great testimony of God. It was that which ruined Satan; it is the testimony of God come into death. Man, with his genius and abilities, might have thought it a strange thing that he should be under death. He might have said, Here am I, with ability and genius, and yet liable to death; but the great answer God gives to that is *Christ* come into death. In the presence of that you could not have any doubt as to the love of God -- it is God's answer to Satan, too.
{88}
Rem. It is the voice of the Son of God come into death.
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. He speaks from the place of death -- He brings in the testimony of God's love.
Ques. Would you say that that was a greater voice even than His life?
F.E.R. Yes, in one sense it was. "God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us". He went about doing good, but His death was the greatest proof of His love. He brings the testimony of God's love into death, and in the presence of the death of Christ, could you have any doubt or question about God's love?
Ques. Would you say a little more as to that point? I do not quite understand your thought.
F.E.R. Well, we were speaking of it last week; the voice of the Son of God is heard because He comes into the place of death, and it is there His voice is heard.
Ques. Is it to the morally dead?
F.E.R. Yes. But then "all were dead" before God's eye. Christ comes into death, and what I understand by His "voice" is that which His voice *speaks*, it is what is peculiar to Himself.
I think what comes out here is a kind of dispensational picture. He goes up on high, and comes down again. It is the same scene as that which comes before us in @Matthew 14, but here you get that, as soon as He came into the ship, they were at the land whither they went, and you do not get the incident as to Peter.
Rem. But, practically, appropriating the death of Christ is, in a way, like Peter walking on the water.
F.E.R. Well, it is; you might well connect them. The Lord gave witness to His being King when He rode into Jerusalem. He was Zion's King, but everything here, as I understand it, was in the way of testimony. Everything had to be taken up really on
{89}
the ground of divine righteousness, but the Lord was here in testimony to everything.
Ques. I suppose His death was the one great thing He did for us?
F.E.R. Yes. He died for us really that we might receive sonship. "God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law; that we might receive the adoption of sons".
Now we come to the didactic part of the chapter, but first you get the sea, a picture of the whole scope of moral death down here, agitated by Satanic influences (verses 18 - 22). It is a picture of what will be when the Lord comes into things again in connection with the Jews upon earth, and so "He bringeth them unto their desired haven". He makes Himself known to them, and, I think, comes into what is, in a kind of way, suitable to men down here, that is, the ship.
Ques. Do you think they brought this trouble upon themselves, in a way, by going without Jesus?
Rem. In @Matthew 14 it was Jesus who constrained them to go into a ship.
F.E.R. Yes, and it was necessary for the purpose of God. I think it was typical of what they will enter into in the future in a very real way. They will know then what the agitation of the winds and the waves really means actually. They will get the sea then, and no mistake, acted on by Satanic influence.
Ques. This represents the Jewish remnant?
F.E.R. Yes; in the future, clinging to the boat which God had given them, but feeling the agitation of the winds and waves. They will be exposed to the activities and energies of Satan. We get in Revelation that when Satan is cast down from heaven, he turns to persecute the seed of the woman, to make war with the remnant of her seed.
Ques. That would represent the nation, or rather the remnant?
{90}
F.E.R. Yes, the remnant. I think the Lord will appear, as I understand it, for their salvation, and faith will recognise Him then. The true remnant will be counting on it. I suppose there is no one living who would deny, even now, that the influences of Satan act upon the world. No one would have imagined how things are affected by Satanic influences. Masses of people today are influenced in a way that they cannot account for.
Ques. What is meant by the words, "Except those days should be shortened ... for the elect's sake" -- does He really limit the time?
F.E.R. Yes. He really limits it to the three and a half years. He puts that limit upon it.
Ques. In verse 27 (@John 6), what is "sealing" there?
F.E.R. Well, I suppose, as Son of man, He had been sealed. It refers to the sealing of the Holy Spirit.
Ques. What is the force of "sealing" in His case?
F.E.R. Well, it is marking Him out as God's -- that is, as *Man*, He is marked out as God's. He could not be sealed in the same way as Son of God. God puts His seal on Him. After the same manner the Holy Spirit is the seal in regard to Christians.
Ques. Would you say that we appropriate Him who is Heir of all things in the mind of God -- the Son of man?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. It is in contrast to what comes out in the preceding chapter. In chapter 6 it is the Son of man, but in chapter 5, if I might use the expression, He is in touch with God, in concert with the Father, acting in concert with Him. When you come to chapter 6, He is in touch with *man*, so He says, "Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed".
Ques. What do you understand is the meaning of
{91}
their question, "What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?"
F.E.R. He answers them, "This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent". He does not leave much to be done on their part.
Rem. How very much it is like what they said to Moses, "All that the Lord hath said will we do, and be obedient".
F.E.R. Yes, indeed, and you find the very same thought in man's mind to this day -- "Teach us how to work the works of God" -- that is their thought. But what they want is *light*. "This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent". Man does not appreciate his need of light, he seeks direction as to how to *work*, but what he really wants is the first principle of all, and that is *light*. How can a man work in darkness?
CHAPTER 6: 30 TO END
F.E.R. We constantly get the Jews using the expression, "What sign shewest thou?" I think the "sign" is what is referred to in @1 Corinthians 1 as the "power of God": "Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God". The Jews sought for a sign, and the Greeks sought after wisdom, and in contrast to that the apostles preached Christ, the power and the wisdom of God. What I understand the sign to be is a proof or sign of God's intervention. So the *manna*, in that way, was a sign of God's intervention, "He gave them bread from heaven to eat".
The giving of the manna authenticated Moses; the point in their mind was that if anyone came to them as from God, he was bound to give them proof of God's intervention. The difference between Moses and Christ was that Moses was nothing. They got the bread from heaven through Moses, but he himself was
{92}
nothing. Now it is the very opposite with Christ -- He was *everything*.
Ques. Does the Lord mean here that Moses gave them the shadow, but not the substance?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. The Father gave them what was called "bread from heaven"; that was the substance, Christ Himself.
Ques. Therefore He is in contrast with the manna?
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. "My Father giveth you the true bread from heaven". The Father is the Giver, not Moses; there was nothing essentially in him. God takes up suitable instruments, no doubt, but still Moses himself was but the instrument. But in Christ was everything. You might read @Hebrews 11 with all its different witnesses, as simply representing the traits of faith in one person. The different men are nothing in themselves.
Ques. Is there any thought in its "coming down" (verse 33)?
F.E.R. Yes, the manna was figurative of Christ. "He gave them bread from heaven to eat", and that was no doubt emblematic of Christ. It is only taken up here to set off Christ.
The great argument of the chapter is that "if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever". In the case of the manna, it did not give them life; they ate it and died -- it was not intended to give them life; but on the other hand, "This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die". The real point in the sign was this -- what were the people on the lookout for? If they were looking for the right thing, they would have received a sign, but they were looking out for the wrong thing and consequently missed the right thing. Christ Himself was the sign, and He was the sign because He came, after all, in a very lowly way -- a babe laid in the manger. The intervention of God was not apparent outwardly, but, nevertheless, it was
{93}
there -- Christ was the power of God. There was a kind of expectation abroad, as we find from other scriptures, but the people were not looking out for what they really wanted.
Ques. I suppose that what would have suited the Jews better would have been that He should come like Elias, and call down fire from heaven?
F.E.R. Yes. But then it would have been a poor lookout for them. They themselves would have come under the destructive power of it. I think if the people had only been looking out for what their need really was, they would have apprehended Christ, but they were looking for the wrong thing.
Ques. You mean that which would have met their need spiritually?
F.E.R. Yes. If they had been in the mind of God, and of Scripture, they would not have stumbled over Christ. They were eaten up with self-importance, but God had no intention whatever of putting honour upon *man*, and therefore it was totally impossible that the Christ should be in any way connected with the honour of *man*. "This shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger". If they had been in the mind of God they would not have stumbled over that fact, or that the Christ should have been going about the world not having where to lay His head. They would have known that the One who came into the world as a Saviour and as a sacrifice for their sins could not have come in any other way. He could have had no part whatever in their honour and glory. They would have received the sign -- One truly coming into manhood, but at the lowest and weakest point of manhood -- a babe. Simeon and Anna looked for redemption in Israel, and they saw the sign.
Ques. Do you not think that the same principle is abroad in the world today?
F.E.R. Yes; you see it in people who stumble
{94}
over Scripture. It is certain to me that, if a man is to live to God, he must see that God will not put any honour upon *man*. That is patent to anyone and everybody.
Ques. "Giveth life unto the world" (verse 33). Does that mean that it is not merely for the Jews?
F.E.R. It is the way that the apostle usually employs the word. "God so loved the world". It is a most wonderful thing that a Man has actually been in the world who was capable of dying for the sins of the people. He was God's Lamb. On the other hand, He could communicate the Holy Spirit. That is what had come in. But then, if He is going to be a sacrifice for their sins, it *must* be that He passes through the world entirely apart from it. That is inevitable and obvious. The people were looking out for the wrong thing, and therefore the right thing was a stumbling-block to them. So the apostle says in 1 Corinthians, "We preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling-block".
In this chapter it was the occasion of the Passover. He makes a great deal of it -- speaking of eating the flesh of the Son of man, and drinking His blood.
Ques. "Cometh down from heaven" (verse 33) is what is characteristic of Him, is it not?
F.E.R. Yes. It expresses the true thought of God in regard to the world; it is One coming down out of heaven, having life, and giving life to the world. That is the thought of God. He comes down out of heaven -- expressing in that way the love and the grace of God -- and gives life to the world. I feel that we are very poorly affected by the ministry of it. He brings into the world the witness and the testimony of divine love, and brings man into it. I think people would be very different if they were more in the light of it.
Rem. And you could not be *in* it and not love.
F.E.R. No, quite so: "He that loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is love". One "coming
{95}
down out of heaven" was the expression of what God's thought was.
What I see is that they had no sense that man was under the judgment of God, under death. It is a most astounding thing how men overlook it. Cain overlooked it, and men today have no idea of it. Life is the great need of man, for he is under death.
Rem. I think you have said that the idea of "*bread*" is life brought within the reach of man's appropriation.
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. The fact is that, morally, as to the history of a man's soul, he really finds life in death.
Ques. In the death of Another?
F.E.R. Quite so. The testimony of divine love comes into death, and when a man apprehends that, it is the beginning of life with him.
Ques. That is the "voice of the Son of God"?
F.E.R. Yes; that is the idea of it to my mind. Love has come into death -- that is the real language of the cross. "God so loved the world". When a man apprehends that, then he begins to live. It is the first breath of life. No man lives until he breathes, and this is the answer to the love of God, it is the beginning of life spiritually.
Ques. Is not *satisfaction* one great thought of John?
F.E.R. Yes; and bread gives the thought of that. I think the chapter brings in -- or at least the effect of it would be -- a peculiar attachment of heart to Christ, just as the previous chapter brings in the voice of the Son of God. Another effect would be complete deliverance from the whole system of the world where Christ is not.
As regards divine Persons, the prominent idea in chapter 4 is the Spirit, then in chapter 5 the Father, and in chapter 6 Christ. In chapter 4 you have the well of water, that is, the Spirit, the water which Christ gives. Then in chapter 5 you get the light of
{96}
the Father, that in which His pleasure lies, His working. And then chapter 6 brings Christ Himself specially before you giving His life -- His flesh -- for the life of the world.
Ques. There are two thoughts brought before us -- "My Father gives", and then His own grace in coming down?
F.E.R. Yes. He traces things from their source; but the great point in the chapter is the Father leading to the Son -- all that the Father drew to Him should come to Him.
Ques. Is that why you say there is peculiar attachment of heart to Him?
F.E.R. Yes. It is because the Father has drawn you to Him; it is the drawing of divine affection.
Ques. Why do you think He says, "Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out"?
F.E.R. I think you must read it in connection with what follows -- "I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me". And then further on, "This is the will of him that has sent me, that of all that he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up in the last day". What it brings out is that the Lord had a charge -- even a responsibility, if one might so say -- to all those whom the Father had given Him. They were committed to His keeping until the last day. He would present them all at the last day. Perhaps I should not use the word "responsible", but He is accountable to bring them all to light then.
Rem. In chapter 17 He lays stress on it, "none of them is lost".
F.E.R. Yes. But now they are not known; we are apparently no different from other men today, but in the last day we shall all come out into view. The last day must be the millennial day, I think.
Ques. Not the last day of the existing period?
F.E.R. No, I do not think so.
{97}
Ques. Was it not a Jewish expression of speech? Martha uses it, you know.
F.E.R. Well, I think the last day must be God's day. I should think that the moment Christ rises from the Father's throne, that must usher in the last day for God. The moment He brings in the "resurrection of the just", that brings in the millennial day.
Ques. God's rest would begin?
F.E.R. Yes. The moment Christ leaves the Father's throne, as has been said, it will alter everything. The moment He begins to act, it ushers in everything for God. Certain things, of course, have to be fulfilled which man is not cognisant of, but still, the moment He rises, it ushers in everything for God. We find the apostle Paul using the expression "that day" -- he had that same day before him.
Rem. And he prays for Onesiphorus that he may find mercy of the Lord "in that day".
F.E.R. Yes. I think the "last day" is God's day. Man will have had six days of it, and God has the last day.
Rem. The day of life and love.
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. It may not be God's day in the sense that it is the eternal state, but it is His day all the same.
Ques. What do you understand by the expression, "*raise him up* at the last day"?
F.E.R. Well, no one today can tell the difference between you and the rest of the world, but the work of God will all come to light then.
Ques. It must have meant something for these Jews to hear this, for they thought that all were to be raised up?
F.E.R. Yes. Here He says, as it were, I will raise up those whom the Father has given Me. Who could raise men up if they are under the judgment of death? It is only *He* who can relieve man of that judgment, and raise him up. He annulled him that
{98}
had the power of death, and He gained the keys of death and hell by dying. He "became dead"; it is on that ground that He has the keys.
Rem. "Keys" is the sign of administration.
F.E.R. Yes, and in order to gain them He had to go into death.
Ques. And since then, has He not put death in quite another light for us?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. Spiritually the Christian has passed out of death into life, there is no longer the judgment of God for him. We can be on terms of the greatest intimacy with God, and even risen with Christ, but not yet, of course, literally free. By the Spirit all is made good to us.
The Lord is looking at the great result all through the chapter, and that is why He speaks so much about raising up at the last day. If it was man who brought all under judgment, it should be man who went into it and annulled it, for "By man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead". It is always that way with God. Man is under death, and the voice of the Son of God appeals to him where he is. He comes into death that His voice may be heard. He brings into death, where man is, the testimony of divine love, and makes death really the place of life. You have the same principle coming out in connection with Israel -- "the valley of Achor for a door of hope".
Rem. So that Satan's work has become, in that way, a perfect fiasco.
F.E.R. Yes. God has maintained His own judgment, and yet taken advantage of it to express His love, so that man might live.
Ques. Do you get the will of God on two sides in verses 39 and 40; one on Christ's side, and the other on our side? Is verse 40 that there is nothing in God's mind against us -- all is open?
F.E.R. I could not quite say. It is put on the ground of man's responsibility. What it conveys to
{99}
me generally is that there is nothing in God's mind against me. The Jew had received testimonies, but here it is "*whosoever*" contemplated. The great idea is, it is open, and there is nothing now in the mind of God against me.
Ques. Is the expression, "seeth the Son and believeth on him", descriptive of a person?
F.E.R. Yes. For though God undertakes to fulfil His own counsels, yet there is nothing in the heart of God against any man whatever, against any man's salvation.
Ques. And yet, in His company, there were some who did not believe?
F.E.R. People *will not* come -- they do not want to come. He brings all that out at the close of chapter 3. They did not want to come "lest their deeds should be reproved". And people do not want to come today. These infidels and free-thinkers do not come to Christ because they do not want their will rebuked. It is intense conceit at the bottom of it -- intense conceit of man's powers and sufficiency, and therefore they do not come to the light. "Ye *will* not come to me, that ye might have life".
Rem. Someone has said, "None *will* come; all *may* come; but some *shall* come".
F.E.R. Yes. No one ever came but by the power of God; yet all are free to come, every one that "sees the Son". The way is open. Any desire after Christ is not hindered, but if God did not accomplish His purpose, He would have nothing at all. He brings down man's will in some way. It would be a very poor lookout for man if God did not accomplish His purpose, and there would be no result for Christ's work; but there *must* be a result. After all, the purpose of God does not come fully out until after the world had rejected Christ -- "the world knew him not" -- and then it is that "as many as received him, to them gave he the right to be children of God".
{100}
The world took no account of its Creator when He came to them.
Rem. How dark they all were!
F.E.R. Yes; they did not recognise Him; and you could hardly expect man to recognise what came down from heaven; but he ought to have known what suited his own need; to recognise what came down from heaven is another thing.
Rem. And He came in the very way suited to all men's needs -- within the reach of all men, accessible to all.
F.E.R. Yes, exactly. The great essential was that He should be accessible; and it may be added that it would be impossible to conceive of a man who had taken part in the glory of man becoming a sacrifice for sin.
Rem. He was, from His birth, completely outside everything here.
F.E.R. Yes. He was "holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners". The world could not have been what it was if Christ could have taken any part in it. I think it is a very great point for people to apprehend that, from the very moment that sin came into the world, God had another world before Him.
Rem. He could not patch up the old.
F.E.R. Exactly. What came out before the flood are the great constituent parts of the world to come -- acceptance, and then the heavenly and the earthly companies. Then after the flood you get the new stock, the man of faith, and the woman marked by confidence. Obedience is what comes out in the man, and confidence in the woman; and then you get the progeny in Isaac and Jacob. Abraham is the father of us all in regard to the world to come. "I have made thee a father of many nations". All the new stock comes of him -- we are all accounted as of Abraham's seed. He is the pattern of the new stock, and what marks him is obedience. In Sarah God sets forth His
{101}
power in the most remarkable way. When there was no hope in nature, He brings life out of death. Abraham looked for a city that had stability; he sought a country, and God prepared him a city. As the Lord said, "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day".
Rem. It is very striking that he should have looked for it just at the time when the earth was divided up among the nations.
F.E.R. Yes. God saw what man was after, He saw the combination of man for his own glory and the gratification of his pride. Man made for himself a city and a tower, and for the moment God scattered it; but now man has got over all that with his telegraphs, and railways, and the like, and you will get the whole thing coming out again in full bloom in Antichrist. When it is all full-blown, and you get the harlot coming into view, then God brings to light the heavenly city, the city which Abraham looked for. After all, man's work is utterly without stability, the very best of it. I do not see anything in it, but not only that, it is positively repulsive.
CHAPTER 6: 41 TO END
F.E.R. I do not think it is very difficult to enter into the murmurings of the Jews, if we know anything at all about our hearts, and how material the mind of man is.
Rem. And then, too, having no real sense of their need was what made it so difficult for them to understand the Lord's words.
F.E.R. Yes. For when God begins to work, and man is really anxious to get light from God, things become comparatively simple to him, but for the human mind to enter into divine thoughts is a very difficult matter. They seem to be astonished at the
{102}
idea of any one coming down out of heaven, and so would people be at the present day, I believe.
These Jews took up the word of the Lord in a kind of material, natural way; they never understood anything moral. The Lord speaks of it afterwards to them, because, when He had told them of His giving them His flesh to eat, they had taken it up in a material way, and He says, "It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life", that is, the words had another character -- they were of another order of things. I think it has reference to their understanding it all in a kind of literal way. They say, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" We see from verse 42 that the Jews knew the genealogy of Christ after the flesh, but they had no idea of His divine genealogy any more than was the case with Peter, until the Father revealed it to him.
Ques. Until @Matthew 16, you mean?
F.E.R. Yes; when he confessed that Christ was the Son of the living God. It was with some sense, I should think, that He had come down out of heaven. He had the sense of Him as of another generation altogether -- He was more than the Son of Mary.
Ques. Peter does not rise to that here, does he?
F.E.R. No, he does not.
Ques. Is not this the corresponding passage to @Matthew 16?
F.E.R. No. This corresponds to @Matthew 14. But the way it is put at the end of the chapter, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God", is, as we all know, incorrect. It really is, "Thou art the holy one of God". The words, "the Christ" are omitted.
Rem. @Matthew 16 is the only place where that expression occurs, "the Christ, the Son of the living God".
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
Ques. What is the exact force of His coming down
{103}
from heaven to give life to the world? "The bread of God is he who comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world" (verse 33).
F.E.R. Well, I have taken it in the same way as other similar expressions in John -- in regard to the *world*, I mean. He was the "Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the *world*".
Ques. There are three expressions used in the chapter -- verse 33, "the bread of God"; then in verse 35, "the bread of life"; and then in verse 51, "I am the living bread". What would you say as to the force of each?
F.E.R. I think that the general idea of "bread" pervades them all. As I understand it, it is satisfaction. Bread is what satisfies, and, in that sense, Christ may be spoken of as the Bread of God, because it was in the heart of God that He should come down out of heaven and give life to the world. The "bread of God" is a moral idea -- it is the Bread of God's providing.
Ques. Before we can get satisfaction we must get life from it?
F.E.R. Yes. He says, "I am the bread of life" -- the one who believes on Him has eternal life -- "he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst". It is the realisation of complete satisfaction. As has been said, "It a region of satisfied desire".
Ques. So that it is in contrast to the manna?
F.E.R. Yes. They ate the manna and died, he now He says, "This is the bread ... that a man may eat thereof, and *not* die". You see, a man in the world is consumed with desire -- the more he gets, the more he wants, he is never satisfied. Supposing man obtains the object of his ambition, to get to the top of the tree in politics, or such like, do you suppose he is satisfied? He has come out into a larger region, he has got a larger scope for his desires, and he has
{104}
just become consumed with desires which are never satisfied.
I think what a man really wants is *bread*. That is what man naturally wants to find, what he craves after and does not get -- he wants *bread*.
Rem. "Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not?"
F.E.R. Yes, exactly.
Ques. What about the "living bread"?
F.E.R. What is called "living bread" is a new idea entirely. You cannot get "living bread" until death is there. Christ is "living bread" *outside* of death. The fact is, He brings life in.
Ques. Is the "living Father" brought in, in the same way, as a contrast?
F.E.R. Yes. "Living" has that character in Scripture. The thought of "water" is refreshment, while "bread" is more satisfaction to a hungry soul. Bread and water go together as necessary to life. In a "dry and thirsty land, where no water is", people die parched -- they have no refreshment.
Ques. Why does the Lord introduce, in verse 44, "Except the Father which hath sent me draw him"? Is it that they were not upon a moral line, and it needed the Father's drawing to bring them to Him?
F.E.R. The idea of it to me is that the Lord did not come down out of heaven to attain anything for Himself. He did not come down to make Himself a centre -- He had no ends of His own to serve. It was no good their murmuring against *Him* -- He had emptied Himself. He did become a centre, but that was no work of His own, it was really the Father who gathered to Him.
Ques. He is the Father's centre, in that sense?
F.E.R. Yes. He never made Himself a centre, otherwise they might have had ground for their grumbling.
{105}
Ques. What is the Lord leading them on to, is it not to death? They must realise their condition under death before anything else.
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. He could not give life to them in their then condition. I think it comes out very plainly in the after part of the chapter. The first place where Christ is to be appropriated is in *death* if He is going to be the satisfaction of a man's heart. It answers, to my mind, somewhat to baptism, if you can understand my thought. What you properly learn in connection with baptism is the fact that Christ has come into death. I was in death, and Christ has come into death. He has, in love, come into the place where I was that I might have Him for the satisfaction of my heart. You cannot apprehend Him as Priest until you have apprehended His death. I think that is what comes out in this chapter. "Unless ye shall have eaten the flesh of the Son of man, and drunk his blood, ye have no life in yourselves".
Ques. Would you say that the Supper is a continuation of that?
F.E.R. Yes. But that is more in connection with the assembly, here it is individual.
Ques. We do not learn all this actually at baptism?
F.E.R. Well, no; because, after all, you have not a very great hand in your baptism, and no doubt a very long time elapses between a person's being baptised, and his learning its import -- its moral import of Christ in death.
Ques. Is there any force in the expression, "He that cometh to me shall never hunger", and then, "He that believeth on me shall never thirst"?
F.E.R. I think that "coming" would indicate a kind of movement in the soul, and "believing" is the reception of the testimony.
I think we are all very deficient as Christians, because we are so little acquainted with divine Persons.
{106}
We have a kind of familiarity with doctrine, but we have never got hold of what the doctrine presents. You get the doctrine of chapter 4 put forth -- I am sure I have often heard it -- and compared with @Romans 5, but then the point in chapter 4 is that you are conscious of the Spirit springing up within you into eternal life. It is not a question of doctrine, but of a well of water springing up. Then, too, in chapter 5 you may have the doctrine of it, but the great point is the bringing in the light of the will of the Father. It is the revelation of the Father's pleasure. Then, when you come to chapter 6 it is the soul finding complete satisfaction in Christ. How few have it, and yet they know the doctrine of @Romans 6. The real deficiency is in the lack of acquaintance with divine Persons. Do not stop at doctrine, or you will only get the shell, while the kernel is not reached! If you get satisfaction in Christ, it is extremely possible that you may have to let many other things go. You cannot have Christ as bread, and be taken up at the same time with a thousand things down here. The two things are incompatible. Paul counted things but dung and dross that he might win Christ.
I think the Father's drawing is really seen in appreciation of Christ. When you see a person with a real appreciation of Christ, then you know it is the effect of the Father's drawing. It is seen in that way.
Where do you think the evangelist has a place in this chapter? You cannot say for a moment that the evangelist draws to Christ. It is, "Except the Father which hath sent me draw him". You may say, But the Father uses agencies. So He does, but that is not the side of things here.
Rem. You get that in @Romans 10.
F.E.R. Well, I hold to @Romans 10, but it is very important to see that all the work is really done by God. Nothing is real but what is of God. "Every one that has learned of the Father comes to me". It
{107}
is the drawing of the Father, and He draws only to Christ.
Rem. Like chapter 17, "Thine they were, and thou gavest them me".
F.E.R. I think it would be an interesting point to think of what is the sign and evidence of the Father's drawing. It seems to me to be in the way of affection for Christ. It is when there is the movement of affection to Christ we see the sign of the Father's drawing.
Ques. The stepping out from the boat?
F.E.R. Yes, I think that would come in too. You are prepared to leave certain things. I think the point in the chapter is the Father drawing to a *rejected* Christ, not to Christ *accepted*.
Rem. And consequently drawing out of the world.
F.E.R. Yes. He is everything to the Father, and the Father draws to Him. If such a thing were conceivable as that Christ was *accepted* here, the Father would not have to draw to Him. The Father's drawing is a proof that He was rejected. This chapter records the same circumstances as @Matthew 14.
Rem. So that that which is spoken of Peter in that chapter is true of every soul that comes to Christ.
F.E.R. Yes. You come to the Living Stone. Peter had to leave the Jewish boat, and we today have to leave the boat, and it is a very Jewish boat, too, in which the mass of people are found today.
Ques. Does it not suppose discipline and progress, "Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me"? You have to learn it in your soul.
F.E.R. Yes, I think so, and man necessarily leaves the boat when he comes to Him.
Ques. You would not say that a man has left the boat when he comes among "Brethren".
F.E.R. No, I would not. He has only left one boat for another. He has only come into a scriptural
{108}
system -- left a "one-man ministry", left the big boat for a smaller one.
Rem. I think it is very beautiful the way it is put in the New Translation: "Every one that has heard from the Father himself, and has learned of him, comes to me" (verse 45). It brings out the great point in it -- the immediateness of it -- that each one has to do with the Father personally.
F.E.R. There is no room in this chapter for the evangelist. The fatal mistake has been to confound this with conversion. Many a converted person has never come into this. They may have tasted that the Lord is gracious, and they are born again, and they are redeemed, I do not doubt, and yet I have equally little doubt whether they have ever come to the "living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious".
Rem. It is to every one that "seeth the Son"; He is a divine Person, and a divine Person in rejection.
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. If He were not in rejection, there would be no drawing.
Rem. You were speaking of the evangelist. He has some place.
F.E.R. Oh, yes, of course. I was only following on what was said as to the work being God's. It is of immense importance to see that.
Rem. I think you have said that the work of the evangelist is to bring light.
F.E.R. Yes, that is it -- he enlightens. Of course, the evangelist is not a mere machine, and he may reason with a man, and all that, but the great thing is to bring light, to "open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light".
Rem. So that, although you may thank God for the one who brought you light, yet if you had not to do with God Himself, you would not have turned from the darkness to light.
F.E.R. Yes. The mere fact of the man getting
{109}
light would not do him any good -- the light has to become effective.
Ques. Is there not a difference between the scriptural thought of an evangelist and the way the work is carried out?
F.E.R. Yes, an evangelist is a wonderful man. I really can hardly conceive anything more wonderful than that a man, in this dark world, should have power to communicate divine light. He can go to people and open their eyes, "that they may turn" -- *that* is God's work. The evangelist has opened their eyes, but it is God's part to make the work effective.
Rem. It is like "diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all".
F.E.R. Yes. I think a man may have the gift of an evangelist, and very little light, but the more light he gets, the better he will be able to help people, and the more he will be helped in the exercise of his gift. If a man were increasing in the knowledge of God, he would become a very much more effective evangelist -- he has got more light.
Rem. And yet the more light that is given the less people like it.
F.E.R. Well, that is very likely, because you see that a man who has not got very much light often preaches to man according *to* man, and is acceptable to man, but that is a different thing from preaching to him according to God. I think the point is to present the light in a divine way. This is what the apostle did, without studying to serve it up acceptably.
Rem. You often find young converts used to others.
F.E.R. Yes, because they are in earnest about it. It is natural that the truth by which a man has been recently affected is in very great freshness. I do not think that if a man goes on he will lose his freshness. The verse, "keep yourselves in the love of God", would show that.
{110}
Ques. What is the force of verse 46, "He which is of God, he hath seen the Father"?
F.E.R. The Lord's object was to show that it was a spiritual work, and to keep them apart from any material thoughts.
Ques. Does not "he that believeth" see the Father?
F.E.R. No. "He which is of God" is the Lord Himself: No one hath seen the Father save He which is of God -- that is Himself: He would not speak of a believer as "of God". It is Himself:
Ques. I suppose you would say that He mentions that in connection with the murmuring in verse 43?
F.E.R. Very likely. The Lord is speaking of Himself all through the passage as simply incarnate, but in verse 51 He speaks of His death: "The bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world". He goes to that point now. All through the passage He is an incarnate Christ on the road to death, because it is only there that He can perfectly put in evidence His love for man. He must come down into death if He is to do that. I think the idea amongst us has been that Christ has died to make us dead, but the truth is He died because we *were* dead. You may recognise, of course, the *fact* that death is upon us, but the acceptance of it is another thing, and though it does not alter the fact that death *is* upon us, the point is that we might *accept* that we are dead, and Christ came into death for that.
Rem. As a man accepts death, the consciousness of the judgment of death is removed.
F.E.R. Yes. I see that divine love has been into death, and the moment I see that, I am free of the judgment.
After all, what is there in divine Persons but *love*? What is there to know of them but *love*? I am sure you only get to them when you love. It is he "that
{111}
loveth is born of God". You cannot touch divine Persons but in the divine nature. Scripture is very explicit about it: "Every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God ... for God is love".
Ques. Why is it three times over, "I will raise him up at the last day"?
F.E.R. Well, it is the consummation. The "last day" is God's day, as I understand it. "Your life is hid with Christ in God" now, but in the last day it all comes out -- it comes to light. The Lord takes care of it.
Rem. I did not quite catch your thought as to the "last day".
F.E.R. The "last day" is God's day in contrast to man's day, and in contrast, too, to all dispensations. God will not be defeated, He will have His day. Man has had a good many days, but God will have the last day.
It is all a question of appropriation at the present. If we were brought into it actually, we should not have to appropriate. It is the way we come into the blessing now, but that is not the way in the last day. There is something *still better* coming -- not appropriation, but manifestation.
Until a man appropriates, he does not assimilate. It is J.N.D. who uses the expression, "assimilated into the life of our being". What Christ presents to us is assimilated and digested, so that a man really lives by Christ. That is the principle upon which we live now, but that will not be the principle in heaven. Appropriation will not mark heaven -- there will be no need of it.
Ques. Does this take in the thought of eating the "old corn of the land"?
F.E.R. Oh, no, I do not think so. It is all the great fact of His coming down to me; it is very much more akin to priesthood. I appropriate Him, in that sense, as a living Priest, and the living Priest would
{112}
lead me into the enjoyment of where He is Himself -- into life. Life is where He is. The old corn of the land has more reference to Himself as the Object and Centre of divine counsels.
Rem. I thought that was what He carried us on to here.
F.E.R. I do not think it goes beyond affection here -- it is a question of affection. The idea to me is that it is finding in Christ a complete and satisfying Object, so that I am apart from all that a man naturally turns to -- independence of all that upon which a man rests down here. Christ Himself was independent of all here, because He lived by the Father, and I do not want anything here if I live because of Him.
Ques. Was it not as sent by the Father, too -- He lived as sent by the Father?
F.E.R. It says of us, "He also who eats me shall live also on account of me", but we could not speak of *His* eating in that way. It was natural to Him to live because of the Father, but we only live because we eat. And how does a man live down here? Why, because of the world. If he had not the world he would wither -- he wants the world to live by. Now that is exactly where Christ was entirely independent of the world, because He lived by the Father. He found everything in the Father. It is a question of affection. He lived by what the Father was to Him. Here it is that Christ is indispensable to me if I have apprehended what Christ is as a controlling Object, like, "Where thou goest I will go", and so on. It is all that line of things here.
Rem. I think the other Persons of the Godhead present quite a different thought from that of Christ.
Rem. "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father".
F.E.R. Yes. But then Christ presents a different thought from any other divine Person. In that way you could not say that the Father died for you, or
{113}
that He is a Priest to you. The fact is that it is "the Son of God who loved me, and gave himself for me".
Ques. And is it not a blessed thing that we have the love of the Son?
F.E.R. Yes. The old corn of the land is in contrast with the manna. I will tell you where you get something more of the old corn, that is in chapter 7: "This spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Spirit was not yet; because that Jesus was not yet glorified". It is the Holy Spirit coming out to report the glory of Christ.
Ques. But must you not have something of the *company* to know what the old corn of the land is?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. You do not feed on the old corn of the land individually. Feeding on the manna is individual, but not on the old corn. The moment you come to the latter you are on assembly ground.
Rem. And that is why the manna ceases.
F.E.R. Yes, exactly. When you come to the truth of the assembly, it is the old corn of the land. Manna is not the food of the assembly, it is for the individual, and I do not think you would be very effective if you did not know this.
CHAPTER 6: 53 TO END
F.E.R. What I see in this chapter is the Lord presenting Himself to us in three different positions: first, as come down out of heaven; secondly, as giving His flesh for the life of the world, so that you may eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood; and thirdly, as ascended up where He was before. The soul has to follow the course which the Lord has taken.
Ques. So that if they were to be with Him when
{114}
He had ascended up where He was before, that meant following Him into death?
F.E.R. Yes; and the Lord introduces after that, "It is the Spirit which quickens, the flesh profits nothing". That is what immediately follows.
Ques. The Spirit was to characterise things down here whilst the Lord was up there?
F.E.R. Yes. It is only the Spirit that could put you in touch with Christ up there.
Ques. Is the following Him into death what you call appropriation?
F.E.R. Yes, though not for salvation, but for deliverance. I think that is the great point that comes out in the chapter. You do also get this much, "Unless ye shall have eaten the flesh of the Son of man, and drunk his blood, ye have no life in yourselves". Verse 53 is a test. Then in the next verse you have the kind of person that has eternal life -- it is a person who eats His flesh and drinks His blood, that is, one who appropriates His death (verse 54). There is a great deal of difference between the faith in His death and the appropriation of His death. There are thousands of people who are in the faith, but not the appropriation, of His death.
Ques. The subject of these chapters, up to chapter 6, is deliverance, is it not?
F.E.R. Yes, quite so.
Ques. That is, you begin with new birth and eternal life in chapter 3?
F.E.R. Well, the introduction of new birth, as I understand it, was really to exclude the Jew. He brings in the necessity of the new birth to put the Jew out of court; the Jew had no more title to be born again than the Gentile, that is, "whosoever". Now if the Jew had a special place, you could not have the "whosoever" brought in, but it is, "whosoever believeth in him" -- Jew or Gentile -- "should not perish, but have eternal life".
{115}
Then when you come to chapter 4 you get the beginning of the subjective side -- of our side -- the "well of water springing up into everlasting life"; that is really the beginning of eternal life in the believer. Then in chapter 5 it is the hearing of the voice of the Son of God -- the full light of the love of God brought in -- and in chapter 6 it is the appropriation of Christ's death, and you cannot get on without that, because it means the deliverance of the person from the whole world-system. It is only by His death -- by the appropriation of it -- that you get free of the flesh and the world-system. But then again, if you are to be brought into full blessing, you must have the Priest. He alone can conduct you into it. "He that eateth me, even he shall live by me" -- we want *Him*.
The great mistake has been in limiting the idea of the Priest to the Jewish idea of it -- the idea of making intercession, and so on -- and not seeing that the Priest is to conduct us into heavenly blessing.
Ques. In, what way does the Priest conduct us in?
F.E.R. I think He makes us conscious of association with Himself. He has become man that we may be associated with Him, so that, as man, He may be the Centre and Head of a company.
Rem. And now He has gone back to God.
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. But "it is the Spirit that quickens". The moment you have the Son of man ascended up where He was before, you get the Spirit, and the Spirit quickens us, so that we may become conscious of association with Christ where He is. You can very well understand that no one could have the idea of His ascending up where He was before, and of their association with Him, if they did not know Him as come down. He came down that we might go up, that we might be with Him, in association with Him, in life. He really came down in order to engage our hearts. You would not care to be with Him if
{116}
you were not attached to Him, and therefore it is that the apostle says, "If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha". Where you learn the grace of Christ is in His coming down: "Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor". His death was necessary, too, for there was no way of deliverance but by death. It is impossible to find deliverance from the world-system but by death.
Ques. Does it correspond with what we get in @Romans 6?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
Ques. And is deliverance the conscious apprehension of it in the soul?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. It is the apprehension of what is the import of the death of Christ. God will not have to say to the flesh any more; He has condemned sin in the flesh, and He will not have anything more to say to it. Well, when I see that, then it works in this way, that *I* will not have any more to say to it either. That is what the Christian says in the power of the Spirit. He has put off the "body of the flesh in the circumcision of the Christ".
Ques. You no longer look for any good in yourself?
F.E.R. No, you do not, and God does not expect you to! You enter into the import of the death of Christ -- that God will no longer have to say to the flesh, and it gives you a true estimate of it.
Ques. Every believer is entitled to take that place?
F.E.R. Yes, exactly. But it must be *individual*, each one for himself.
Ques. Is there any meaning in the appropriation of His death except in deliverance? "Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood" is the maintenance of deliverance, is it not?
F.E.R. Well, it has to be maintained; but in that verse it is the *character of person*, the one who eats His flesh and drinks His blood, who has eternal life. It is
{117}
the appropriation of His death, or, as the apostle puts it, "always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus".
Ques. Is there an allusion to three "eatings" in these verses?
F.E.R. Well, the connection is maintained in that way, but what really comes out is that there is reciprocity. He is in your affection, and you are in His, and after all, no person has eternal life if he does not love Christ. Look at verse 56: "Dwells in me and I in him". The very thought of "dwells in me" is affection, and then, too, in the next verse, "As the living Father has sent me and I live on account of the Father, *he* also who eats me shall live also on account of me". Christ is indispensable to us. He wanted nothing but the Father, and so in regard to the Christian, if he has Christ, he does not want anything else. People talk about eternal life, and claim to have it, but after all, many of them have very little affection for Christ, and the whole thing is contradictory.
Ques. Has not verse 53 been used of the sinner coming to Christ?
F.E.R. But it is not the *sinner* coming at all. Chapters 4, 5 and 6 are strictly continuous. They do not go back to chapter 3 at all.
I think it is immensely important to see that the manifestation of Christ was bound to solve, in some way or other, the question of eternal life. You get hints of it, you remember, in the Old Testament. There is reference to it in @Psalm 133, and then, too, in Daniel. The Christ was in some way to bring in a solution of that question. You find people coming to the Lord with the question as to how they might have eternal life. But He did not bring in eternal life according to the Old Testament scriptures. It has got its solution, but it takes another form. The secret and ground of it now is the Spirit in the believer.
Rem. And Christ is the model of it.
F.E.R. Yes, quite so -- He is "the true God and
{118}
eternal life". But with Him there were no links to be broken, while now what we have is the mighty energy of the Spirit springing up and emancipating the believer. Then, too, we have the testimony of divine love in Christ's death -- we have that light; and now, in this chapter, we get the grace of Christ. He became a Man in order to conduct us into the scene of life where He is. He became a Man for that purpose, that we might *touch* Him, that He might abide in us, and we in Him. It is a very different thing from *believing* in Him. You believe in Him before you have affection for Him. Affection is by the Spirit.
Rem. "The Son of man ascending up where he was before" shows the sphere.
F.E.R. Yes; and what a remarkable way of putting it, is it not? For He certainly was not the Son of *man* when He came down, but the great point is, that it is *that Person* who came down. The Son of man is a designation of that Person -- the Person designated by the title "Son of man" goes up.
Then you get the great truth that the Spirit quickens, and what I understand that to mean is the Spirit indwelling -- it is in contrast with the flesh. It is not the Spirit of God acting upon a man as when he is born again, but it is an indwelling Spirit who quickens -- makes a man really alive. I think the great point in chapter 4 is emancipation; the water of life, which Christ gives, springs up to eternal life; but I think it goes even farther here. There it is emancipation from sin, but here it involves deliverance from the flesh and the world-system.
Rem. This has to do with the affections of heaven, so to say.
F.E.R. Exactly; it makes you responsive to the love of God. The first breath of divine love in a person is response to the love of God -- when a person can say, "I love God".
{119}
Ques. What is the connection between this and the Son quickening as in the previous chapter?
F.E.R. Oh, well, I think the one takes the external side, and the other the subjective. Of course, in one sense all was the work of the Son -- the whole thing from beginning to end; but if you speak of the means employed in us, it is the *Spirit*. On the one hand, it is the Son acting in concert with the Father, but on the other, it is the Spirit who is operative within. Here in chapter 6 it is the subjective side. The Lord is really rebuking them for having taken up His words in a material way. He says, "The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life". He had been talking about His flesh, and they took it up naturally -- the words that He spake were *spirit* and *life*. The fleshly understanding of the words of Christ profits nothing.
Rem. So that it comes to this, that only the spiritual can understand them.
F.E.R. Well, quite so. There is nothing that tends to lead people wrong more than understanding things literally and materially. If you try to understand things literally, you soon go wrong. Every illustration drawn from natural things, when used to bring spiritual things before us, can never be more than a figure. For instance, when Scripture speaks of new birth, or of the one body as a representation of the body of Christ, it only presents us, as it were, with figures, and we must not forget it.
Ques. Please explain what you mean by carrying things out *literally*?
F.E.R. Well, for example, the attempt to make out a mystical man. It is the employment of a figure which Scripture presents to us to show us the intimacy that exists between the members of the body down here; that every member is indispensable, and that all are interdependent, but you must not employ the figure beyond that.
{120}
Rem. And the Spirit would only give that understanding of it.
F.E.R. Yes. You take the figure up as the Spirit gives you understanding of it, but if you attempt to use it beyond that you will get into error.
Ques. How does faith differ from appropriation?
F.E.R. Well, I think that a person is saved by the *faith* of facts. I do not think you are saved by the *understanding* of facts. That means that you understand the *import* of the facts, which is appropriation -- what the divine mind was in those facts.
Ques. But are they not very intimately connected?
F.E.R. Yes, but they are very different. You see, it is a *believer* who *appropriates*, while it is a hitherto *unconverted man* who *believes*.
Rem. It is very important to see that it is a believer who is contemplated in this chapter.
F.E.R. Yes. It is "he that eateth". You could not speak of an unbeliever "putting off the body of the flesh" -- that is the work of a believer. When a man first believes, the death of Christ is apprehended in its value in the sight of God, but that does not argue for a moment that he enters into the import of His death. The beginning of that is baptism, I think. You see that the only place for the man that has gone is *burial*. You come to this, that the flesh has got to go, because it has already gone for God; but you do not expect an unbeliever to enter into that, and therefore I think you cannot be too simple in the presentation -- in the gospel -- of the death and resurrection of Christ. The gospel comes out in the way of a testimony, an announcement. The gospel is heralded, and where the facts are accepted -- not necessarily understood -- it is the salvation of the one who believes.
Ques. Is not the gospel the light of God?
F.E.R. Yes, I think it is; but then God does not stop to explain to people all the import of Christ's death, that is another thing. So you eat the flesh of
{121}
the Son of man, and drink His blood, and enter into the true import of that death in the mind of God. Then, again, you are "risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead", and you have come to the import of His resurrection. You get a statement of the fact of the resurrection in @1 Corinthians 15, where you have brought before you the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ, but when you come to think of being risen with Him, you apprehend that the resurrection of Christ is the introduction of a new world. All, on the one side, has gone in the death of Christ, but in His resurrection a new world comes into view, and a new world not formed out of the wreck of the old one. Then I can say that all the ties that bound me to this system are broken. How can I cling to a world that God has done with?
Ques. Was this what brought in some of the difficulty here in this chapter, "This is an hard saying"?
F.E.R. Yes. A very hard saying indeed to people who are not content to see that this world is gone for God.
Rem. And especially so for a Jew.
F.E.R. Yes. All his hopes and expectations were bound up with it. The Lord's words meant the breaking of all ties which he had once recognised.
Rem. Then the resurrection is really the introduction of the eternal day.
F.E.R. Yes, it is. "Through the faith of the operation of God who hath raised him from the dead". It is a most wonderful thing to be risen with Christ, all that tied me to this world broken. Perhaps I have still to get a living in it, and still to serve the Lord for a little moment, but all the bonds are broken, and I stand a *free man*. That is the power of the apostle's exhortation, "Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free". Morally
{122}
the believer is no longer in the world. The ground of deliverance is there for every Christian; the way of deliverance has been formed for every one who will take it.
Rem. And there is no other way.
F.E.R. No. The fact is that, as others have said, a man carries the image of the world in his heart, and if you were to shut up a man in a dungeon, he would still have with him that image. Now you may think this is a very hard thing to say, but I do think that believers very poorly love Christ, and they have very little conception of the love of Christ. Do you think that, if they loved Him, they would care to be happy in the world from which He has been rejected?
Rem. Just satisfied with the knowledge of the forgiveness of sins, and that they will go to heaven when they die. The latter part of this gospel brings out how much the Lord counted on the affection of His own.
Ques. When He says, "The Spirit quickens", does it mean that the Spirit can conduct you along that road?
F.E.R. Yes. Quickening and deliverance must go together.
Rem. Deliverance has more to do with the scene where we are, and the other with the scene where Christ is.
F.E.R. Yes. Every element in this scene is totally unsuitable to Christ: man, man's will, Satan's power, sin, ambition, no matter what it is. It follows that if you are going to live with Christ, you must be delivered from this scene. "He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal".
As to the thought in verse 67, "Will ye also go away?" we have had the experience of people leaving us, as you know, but the Lord had just the same. Only think what it must have been to the Lord to have
{123}
that experience, conscious of what He Himself was!
Ques. And they were disciples?
F.E.R. Yes, up to a certain point. You see, it is not that people do not walk with *us*, but they leave the light. It may be that we offend them; and in the case before us, flesh was not attracted -- the only people who were attracted were those in whom God wrought.
Rem. Only those in whom there was something of the divine nature.
Rem. These were the sorrows of love with the Lord.
F.E.R. Yes; and I am sure one grieves over those who walk not with us. It is a matter of real grief and trouble, but what must it have been to Him!
Then He tests the twelve -- "Will ye also go away?" And then you have Peter's answer, "Thou hast the words of eternal life". They had that sense of Christ, whatever else was lacking. Now I have, in some measure, that sense of the *company*. They may not all be quite right, perhaps, but still it is Christ's company.
Rem. And what holds you really is Christ.
F.E.R. Yes. I do not think the point is that every one is quite to your mind. If it is Christ, and Christ's company, how can you turn away? Looking back on the last twenty or thirty years, what have we been doing? I think I should be prepared as much as any, and perhaps more, to allow all the weakness and failure of the company, as well as in myself -- but apart from that, where am I to go? The company that I care to be with, and where I am, thank God, is where the light of God is, in spite of infirmity, where there is light upon the truth. I could not say, dogmatically, that the Lord is with *them*, but what I judge is that the Lord is where the *truth* is, and it is my conviction that the Lord is with us. The Lord is where the truth is, and that is the company for me. Do you
{124}
mean to say that the disciples were very different from ourselves? I am sure that the Lord had a very great deal to bear with them, in their dullness, and hardness, and incapacity, and so on. But if there had been *no* response to His solicitude for them, the Lord would not have continued to give them light. My firm conviction is that the Lord never cares to go on with indifferent people. It was when Moses "turned aside to see" that he got light, that is, he responded to God's approach, and got light.
Rem. If you turn away from the light, then it is a case of "how great is the darkness".
Ques. And does not the principle that "he that hath, to him shall be given" hold good?
F.E.R. Yes, I think it does. If people remain in their apprehension of things where they were twenty or thirty years ago, what I should say is that they have overlooked the moving of the tent of testimony -- it is continually shifting. It is not that the word of God is altered -- the truth is unalterable -- but what I want to see is the way in which the truth is adaptable to the circumstances in which I am at the present moment, and not twenty years ago. I do not believe the children of Israel waited twenty years in any one place, they were continually on the move with the tent of the testimony, and if they had not done so they would have been starved.
Rem. And we starve if we do not go on with the tent.
F.E.R. Yes, we do; we should not get the manna. We have not got any rules as to how to get on without God, and it would be a poor thing if we had.
It is a most wonderful thing to be in the company of the Lord, as we see in Peter's words, "Thou hast the words of eternal life". But it is a most terrible thing, too -- everything comes to light. He was light, and it brought all the goodness of God in, while at the same time it exposed everything that was not of
{125}
God. "One of you is a devil", is what He said of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. The Lord does not try to hold things together in any kind of natural way. He held those whom the Father had given to Him, but He does not get followers together in any human way -- in fact, He exposed them, "One of you is a devil". I think it was in divine wisdom that Judas was chosen. Under the very best influences, it was shown what the heart of man could be: that a man three and a half years in the company of the Lord could be a traitor. There was a traitorous heart there, though probably Judas did not intend all that time being a traitor.
As regard Peter, he had, with all his faults, real affection and attachment of heart to Christ. It was his affection that led him into danger; there was real affection mixed with self-confidence, Peter had to learn to analyse things; he was really attached to Christ, but he was in a position to which he was not equal. I think the prayer which the Lord taught His disciples was, after all, very suitable, "Lead us not into temptation". If you are placed in circumstances of temptation, then you may pray to be kept, and you may be kept from it. We may ask not to be put into circumstances for which we are not equal.
CHAPTER 7
F.E.R. I think this chapter brings us, in a certain sense, to a new departure in the gospel, The latter part brings us very distinctly into the presence of the glory of Christ, and you have also the gift of the Holy Spirit. All that brings in what I might call a new platform.
Ques. What would you say is the difference between the gift of the Spirit, as presented here, and in chapter 4?
F.E.R. Well, as a matter of fact, the Holy Spirit is never mentioned in chapter 4.
{126}
Rem. "The water that I shall give him", etc.
F.E.R. Well, no doubt it refers to the Spirit, but He is not mentioned. He is only spoken of in a limited way in chapter 4. What I mean is that He is not a witness of the glory of Christ there, but a well of water springing up to eternal life in the believer.
Rem. That is an individual thing, but here it is collective.
F.E.R. Yes. Here it is the Spirit "which *they* that believe on him should receive", and in chapter 4 it is "the water that I shall give *him*, shall be in *him*", etc. In chapter 4 it is the gift of Christ, in chapter 5 the word of Christ, and in chapter 6 the flesh of Christ.
Ques. You take the Spirit here as the witness of the glory of Christ?
F.E.R. Yes, do you not think so? It speaks of the Spirit in that way. "The Spirit was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified", and I think it is the bringing in of the glory of Christ, and the Holy Spirit as the witness of it here, that puts everything really on a new platform. It is the character of the time we are in -- not now Jesus on earth, but Jesus glorified, and the Holy Spirit given. It has sometimes been spoken of as "the Spirit's day", and I think rightly.
Ques. You mean the present moment?
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. You would say that it is not so much the Spirit as indwelling here, but as witnessing?
F.E.R. Yes, it is. When you come to chapter 10 you find the relation in which Christ stands to the saints -- it is a new one. He is the "Shepherd of the sheep", and in chapters 11 and 12 He is glorified. I have been much interested in chapter 4 in thinking of the well of water. You see, the case is exemplified in a woman, and I have a kind of idea that in Scripture the woman always represents humanity. She is representative of humanity. Now what marked the
{127}
woman in chapter 4 was that she was a woman with affections, but the affections were all out of gear -- as you might say, ill-regulated.
Rem. She had no proper object for her affections.
F.E.R. No, Affections were there, but going out in wrong directions, Now the "well of water", as I understand it, refers to the Spirit of God forming and regulating in the believer right affections.
Rem. Affections having God for their object.
F.E.R. Yes; having God for their supreme object. You get the affections regulated. Man, after all, is an extraordinary creature, because he is capable of affections, but where God is concerned, his affections are perverted. But when the man is born again, the Spirit comes, as a well of water within him, to form and to control his affections -- affections which, naturally, were all out of gear.
Ques. Would you connect that with the love of God?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so; and the next thing is that Christ gets His proper place, too. The affections are well regulated -- that is the effect of the "well of water".
Ques. When you spoke of "humanity" just now, you meant what God formed, I suppose?
F.E.R. Yes; humanity as such. You will often find in the parables of our Lord that humanity is represented by a woman.
As we saw before, in chapter 5 you have the word of Christ, and really that is the revelation of the Father. It is no longer the Almighty, or Jehovah, but the Father. Then in chapter 6 you have Christ Himself as the "Bread" -- for complete satisfaction of heart, the affections all brought into regularity -- and Christ the satisfaction of the soul, His grace is apprehended, the grace that brought Him into manhood, the soul's satisfaction, so that you do not hunger. I think it is in that form that eternal life is brought to
{128}
us in the present day; there is no great outward change, but there is a very great inward change.
Ques. I suppose, up to this point, the man's need has been met?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. The Spirit is brought in here on the last day of the feast to inaugurate another day.
Rem. It was the eighth day.
F.E.R. Yes; and I think what the Lord was bringing in was foreshadowed in the great day of the feast.
Rem. And signified by the feast of tabernacles.
F.E.R. Yes. Every feast has been fulfilled except the feast of tabernacles. The passover, and the feast of unleavened bread, and of the firstfruits, and the feast of weeks, the whole of them have been fulfilled, and nothing remains to be fulfilled except the feast of tabernacles, for which we still wait.
Ques. But is not the believer brought into touch with that which will presently be fulfilled -- I mean by the ministry of heavenly things?
F.E.R. Well, he gets something very much greater than a feast; a feast is always connected with earth. The feast in the earlier part of this chapter served to bring out the condition of the Jews -- what their spiritual condition was. Even His brethren did not believe on Him. It was not any advantage to have been of Christ's natural kindred -- it is most painful to see it.
Rem. And it is the same now as to spiritual things.
F.E.R. I think it is. The natural thought would be that it was a great advantage to be connected with the Lord by natural ties, but what we see is that His kindred were just as unbelieving as all the rest.
Rem. It is remarkable, too, that He did not commit His mother to His brethren after the flesh.
F.E.R. No. Here their only idea was that He should show Himself to the world. And you will find
{129}
the same idea abroad in the present day. The great thought is that if a man does anything at all extraordinary he should show himself to the world.
Rem. To be known openly.
Rem. And to have the world's approbation.
F.E.R. It is as certain as possible that, if men are not conscious of God's approval, they will turn to the world for it. I think it accounts for defection, and all that, very often.
Rem. But there is no support of the Spirit in that kind of thing.
F.E.R. No. In regard to the Lord Himself, He was entirely outside of it all. He does go up to the feast, but He goes, as it were, secretly.
Rem. If the world approves, it is too often because something is ministered which the world can appreciate.
F.E.R. Yes. There is some recognition of the flesh. You see here there was a sort of moral power about the Lord which they could not resist; and what a wonderful thing it was to see the Lord here in that state of things. He goes up to the temple and teaches. The Jews sought to kill Him, and His brethren did not believe in Him, but yet the Lord just goes on -- "He went up into the temple and taught".
Rem. It was the Jewish system here spoken of as "the world".
F.E.R. Yes. It is always so in the gospel of John. "Me it hateth, because I testify of it" -- that is manifestly the Jew.
It is interesting to see that nothing is recognised by John as for God except what is of Christ. The feasts are called "feasts of the Jews". It is all *new* here -- nothing is of God but Christ -- the *old* is done with. It is a great help in the understanding of the gospel of John to see that there is no acknowledgment of anything that went before; it is in that sense that I understand the expression in the epistle, "Ye have
{130}
known him that is from the beginning [or outset]". That, of course, refers to Christ.
Rem. And the introduction of the Son of God was specially new.
F.E.R. In the ways of God, one can very well understand that there is a kind of overlapping. God saw fit to take up what existed; but then, as to any kind of outward dealings with the people, it all came to an end, and all that remained, all that stood, was what began in Christ -- nothing stood but that; all else came to an end. I think it is a great point for us to apprehend that there is a completely new point of departure, a starting-point, and that point is Christ. Whatever God might see fit to work down here, either in regard to the Jew or the Gentile, Christ is the starting-point for God.
Rem. It began when the Word became flesh.
F.E.R. Yes; that is the starting-point.
Rem. And made available to man in death.
F.E.R. Yes. But then death was not the starting-point of life. Life comes into death on our account, but death is not the starting-point of life. This starting-point is *Christ*. "In him was life". *We* find life in death because Christ has come into death, but, looked at in the ways of God, the starting-point of life is *Christ*, not death.
I think we get here the extraordinary patience of the Lord coming out. He went up to the feast, not openly but secretly (verses 10 - 16); then, "If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak from myself".
Ques. What does He refer to when He says, "my doctrine"?
F.E.R. Well, I suppose to the subject of His teaching -- what He taught. The Lord was always true to the position He had taken up as the "sent One". He did not take up a position down here of being a
{131}
source of doctrine, but He says, "My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me".
Rem. He did not link it with what went before; it was what was distinctly His own.
F.E.R. Well, quite so; it was not contrary to what went before, but yet it was quite distinct from it.
Rem. Everything that we have had in the preceding chapters.
F.E.R. Yes. But then all that was new. You could not find in the Old Testament the well of water, or the revelation of the Father, or Christ as the satisfaction of the soul -- the living Bread. He was solving, in a totally unexpected way, the great question of eternal life. It was spoken of in the Old Testament, and Christ presents the solution of it. The Old Testament predicted it, but Christ presents its solution -- how it is come to pass.
Ques. Why is God's will put in connection with knowing the doctrine?
F.E.R. Well, the Lord takes up a position in contrast to Antichrist. Antichrist takes the position of being a *source* -- but Christ will not take that ground. He is in accordance with God's will, and He says, "If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine". The great point to my mind is His having left the truth of *God* where it was.
Ques. How do you mean?
F.E.R. Well, God was God, and man was man. He does not, as it were, enter into that, and so He says to the young man, "Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one; that is, God". And I think I can see the great wisdom of the way in which Christ came, leaving things just where they were, and so He says here, "If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of *God*, or whether I speak from myself". God, as such, was God still.
Ques. Was it not the great point in the Fall that man assumed to be as God?
{132}
F.E.R. Yes, quite so; and you see the thing developed in Antichrist. Even in the heavenly city you have God *and* the Lamb -- it is God objectively. The truth is in its proper place now, and I regard it as a point of the greatest moment that the truth of *God* was left just where it was -- God was God. The truth -- the revelation of God -- came out in such a way as not to bring in confusion between God and man.
Rem. But, at the same time, it brings in the most blessed relation between God and man.
F.E.R. Yes, quite so; but God remains God, and man man. Christ here gives up everything to God, "If any man will do *his* will".
Rem. And yet elsewhere it says, "He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes".
F.E.R. Yes. But the word there is really conferred authority. He had everything at His disposal -- all the wealth and power of God -- but He would not take the place of God here.
Rem. Although this gospel makes it perfectly clear that He is God.
F.E.R. Yes, exactly; but all the fulness of God was brought close to man in a vessel. It was all in a vessel.
Rem. "Before Abraham was, I am".
F.E.R. But that was true of Him personally. Here He was the vessel in whom God was set forth to man, in whom the fulness of God dwelt; but my point is that God remains God, and man man, so that you get no confusion between God and man.
Rem. Although all the fulness of God dwelt in a man.
F.E.R. Yes. He was the temple of God, and the consequence is that, the Son having become a man, through all eternity He will be subject. The abstract, essential truth of God is presented to us in the Father: "To us there is one God, the Father".
The fact is, that even in regard to Scripture, if
{133}
people want to know what it means, and to be certain about the word of God, they must have preparedness of heart to *do* the will of God. You find people with all sorts of questionings about the word of God, but what they really want is not to be satisfied about their questionings, but "if any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine".
Rem. Otherwise there is the "ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth".
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. To be carping at the word of God is just the state of the human mind and will at work, and not man in lowliness. I can quite understand a man having questions through weakness, but if he wills to do the will of God, he will have all his questions solved.
"He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory". That is a hidden reference to Antichrist, but the principle is true of any man who speaks from himself -- he himself is the source of what he says. "He that seeketh his glory that sent him [that is *Christ*] the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him"
Rem. He does not say that He was that, but He could not hide really what was there.
F.E.R. Yes. It is most wonderful the place the Lord takes here, a most wonderful place for a divine Person to take, to accept the place of being *sent*, and when sent He seeks not His own glory, but His who sent Him, and so He proves Himself to be true, "and no unrighteousness is in him".
Rem. Except for the Fall, in one way you cannot see how God could have been revealed.
F.E.R. No. Man would have known Him as a beneficent Creator, but he would never have known the love of God -- there would have been no occasion for it. The revelation of the love of God is consequent upon the Fall having come in, and redemption having been accomplished. Then again, I doubt how far
{134}
there could be the acquaintance with God of an innocent creature like Adam. God was not at all known by him from *contrast*; we know Him to a very large extent by contrast, through the fact of knowing good and evil. He did not make Himself known to angels, but our capability of knowing God is, to a very large extent, by our knowing good and evil. We learn goodness in contrast with evil, and we know evil in contrast with goodness. I doubt very much if a man could know God thoroughly if he did not know evil -- but he knows it.
Rem. Yes, and he is delivered from it.
F.E.R. I do not, of course, mean knowing evil in the sense of delighting in it. A holy person knows evil, but, by the very fact that he is holy, he abhors it.
Rem. He is made a partaker of the divine nature.
F.E.R. Yes, quite so; and He chastens us that we may be partakers of His holiness.
Rem. You have not far to go to know evil.
F.E.R. No, quite so. You find so much of it in yourselves. The apostle says, "I would have you ... simple concerning evil", which does not involve our ignorance of what it is, but our avoidance of it in a practical sense. "Be ye holy, for I am holy".
Ques. What did He mean by saying, "Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am" (verse 28)?
F.E.R. He answers them according to their own state. They thought they knew Him, and He reveals their thought. You see, they could not possibly enter into the thought of a man here without a *will*, and that was the very position the Lord took up. "If any man will do *his* will". The fact is, the only Man who was ever in the world with a *title* to a will was here without a will.
Rem. Because His will would have been entirely according to God.
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. The Lord takes the ground of doing all from the Father -- everything He did, and
{135}
every word that He spoke. The Father was the source of everything He said or did. We see it even in Gethsemane -- "Not my will, but thine be done".
On the other hand, the one that speaks from himself seeks his own glory. You get this thought embodied in the Antichrist. He sits in the temple of God, and shows himself that *he* is God -- it is his own will.
Ques. There are other antichrists, are there not?
F.E.R. There are others, but they are all of the same spirit. There are plenty of antichrists in Christianity. I think I am justified in saying that the Pope is the greatest example of it. You see, he speaks from *himself*, and if a man does that, any man, you may say what you like, he is seeking his own glory. You could not conceive a greater contrast than between Christ and the Pope. I often wonder that the great dignitaries of the church do not see the difference between Christ and themselves. But I suppose they think that Christ was rejected when He was here, but that now He is in honour, and so they share in His honour! I came across an address by one of them, in which he said that now that Christ had become a Man, He had put honour upon humanity, and that therefore the injunction could be given us "to honour all men"! That was the gist of what he said -- a most extraordinary thing to say!
Rem. "If the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch".
F.E.R. I only mentioned it because it shows what is in the minds of people as to the fact of Christ's having become a Man. They do not see what we get in this chapter, that Christ was rejected, even by His brethren.
CHAPTER 8
F.E.R. I think that down to the end of chapter 6 the prominent thought has been *life*. Then in chapters 8 and 9 the great thought is *light* -- the light
{136}
came to the Jews and they were tested by it. Chapter 7 is the point of transition, and brings in the truth of the Spirit, and the day of the Spirit, in order to pave the way to chapter 10, only I think that first the Jew had to be tested by the light.
Rem. But they "loved darkness rather than light".
F.E.R. Yes. It is the state of the Jews completely tested by the light; you get the expression in this chapter, and also in the next, "I am the light of the world". The effect of the light is to make manifest, and the state of the Jew is made manifest by the light, both in this chapter and the succeeding one.
In the introduction to this chapter you get Christ doing what even the law could not do. There is the case of the woman brought before the Lord, and in the presence of the light her accusers are convicted by their consciences, and go out, one by one. There was no bowing to the light on their part, but, any way, they are convicted by it. They could have executed the law, as far as the woman was concerned, but they are themselves convicted by their consciences and go out. The fact is, if you were to be really in the light of the presence of God you could not execute the law.
Rem. The Lord Himself would not condemn.
F.E.R. The law was the system under which the people were placed, and they had to feel the edge of it, and the light was here in the way of testimony, but not to judge. The light was the light of God, and by the very fact that it was light it was bound to expose all that was contrary to it, but it was not here to judge.
I think, you know, they thought of Christ merely as a man -- no more than a man -- while the fact was they were standing in the presence of the full revelation of God, of the One in whom "all the fulness was pleased to dwell". That was the folly into which the Jews had fallen, they judged the Lord by the standard of men.
Rem. As He says in verse 14, "Ye cannot tell
{137}
whence I come, and whither I go". They neither knew His origin nor whence He came.
F.E.R. No. He was immeasurable. He really had no origin, He filled all things. Nothing could have been greater folly than to attempt to judge of Christ by any human standard. They might have felt that from His words at the beginning of the chapter, "I am the light of the world", but instead of this they say, "Thou bearest witness concerning thyself; thy witness is not true". They were judging after the standard of the flesh. Imagine applying the standard and judgment of man to the "fulness of the Godhead"! I do not think you could possibly understand the chapter except as you see that they were in the presence of the "fulness of the Godhead". He says in verse 18, "The Father that sent me beareth witness of me", "my judgment is just" -- is true -- "because I am not alone, but I and the Father who has sent me"; that is, that if He judged at all -- "I judge no one" -- it would be according to the full truth of God. The Lord did not judge independently, or in reference to Himself, but according to the full truth of God.
Rem. You mean moral judgment, of course, for He judged no one.
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. The light was not here in the way of judgment, but of testimony, and if God sees fit to give a testimony to man as to what *He* is, and of what *He* wills, it must be in pure grace.
Rem. The life of Christ here consisted in making God known.
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. The life was the full expression of God, and this must be in pure grace. He might set up a throne of judgment, and the light would be there, but that would be in the way of judgment. The light coming into the world in the way it did is of pure grace.
Ques. I suppose that every testimony of God is on that line?
{138}
F.E.R. Yes. Even the very last testimony comes in that way, "Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come" (@Revelation 14: 7); that is, that man might escape the judgment.
The great principle that underlies John is that the fulness of the Godhead was presented to man in Christ, and the second principle comes out in chapter 5. "The Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will". "For what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise".
Ques. What do you understand by, "If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death"?
F.E.R. Oh, that is moral -- a man passes out of death into life.
Rem. It has been applied to death actually -- that a man never sees death at the moment of death.
F.E.R. I understand it to mean that the believer passes out of the region of death morally. I think that is the way the Jews understood the Lord's words. They use the expression "taste of death". "Tasting death" gives the moral idea, a man tastes the bitterness of death.
Rem. But then the Jews seem to go on to speak of the prophets and Abraham.
F.E.R. Yes. But I was thinking of the way in which they understood His words.
Rem. I had always thought that it was on the same line as "passed out of death into life".
F.E.R. Yes, I think it is. I believe you must take what comes out in this chapter with that which is presented in the preceding ones. The Jews say to Him here, "Where is thy Father?" (verse 19). "Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father
{139}
also". You cannot understand this apart from what the Lord had presented in chapter 5. What He had brought to light was the full grace of God, and this without any obstruction on His own part. There was no obstruction of sin or anything else on Christ's part, as there always is on ours. Now the truth that comes out in chapter 5 is that the Father raises up and quickens the dead. People do not rightly estimate that, but it is the only thing that is to be done with man. You see, if a man is in a state of death, there is nothing to be done with him but to quicken him.
Rem. So He raises up the dead to life, that is, in its moral sense.
F.E.R. Yes. I am sure you cannot understand what comes out here if you do not understand the presentation of life in chapter 5.
Rem. He was the true "candle" of the Father.
Rem. "Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning".
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. He was the real, true expression of what He spoke.
I think this is a most important chapter; because you could not have the "one flock", or the "one shepherd", as in chapter 10, except as the Jew had been exposed, and it is for this reason that you get full exposure and conviction brought to the Jew, as in the beginning of this chapter.
Rem. And their exposure cleared the ground.
F.E.R. Yes; the Jews all had to go. He alone could say, "He that is without sin among you" -- for there was no sin in Him. But then that was not all the truth. He had fully presented the Father, and He worked in perfect accord with the Father. "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work", and as the Father raised up the dead, so He did.
Rem. The man in chapter 9 gets eyesight.
F.E.R. Yes, and they turn him out. There is a great difference between the other gospels and the gospel
{140}
of John. In the other gospels you get the testimony: "the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised", and so on. You see goodness in the midst of Israel, relieving men of the effects of sin, and so on, but the simple thing you get in John is, "The Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth".
Rem. It goes to the very root of it all.
F.E.R. Yes; and it takes up that which alone could meet the case. Now it would be a very good thing indeed for me, if I were blind, that I should see, or if I were lame, that I should be made to walk, but, after all, the root of the matter would not be touched. And so, even the forgiveness of sins, important as it is, in a sense only comes in incidentally. The man who is quickened to a new life does not live as before. The whole position is totally changed.
Now here you get the Jews saying to Him, "Where is thy Father?" -- the most cold-blooded thing you can imagine! To me it is such a profound thing that One was here by whom the Father was perfectly expressed to man, without anything at all to hinder or obstruct the expression of it, and yet practically no impression was produced.
Ques. Is that why He said, "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father"?
F.E.R. Exactly. Here He has to say, "Ye neither know me, nor my Father", and you see how they were all held back, poor wretched men, without any judgement at all; they could not lay a finger upon Him, and yet they are not a bit subdued. Nothing could have been more manifest than their insensibility morally, and yet they are not a bit subdued by it. Every word He said only raised fresh difficulties.
Later on He says to them, "Whither I go, ye cannot come". They say, "Will he kill himself?" to which He replies, "I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins". Where did He go?
{141}
It was where they were not morally able to follow. The Father was present in Him, and yet, at the same time, He retired to the Father -- He goes back to Him -- and where He went they were morally unable to come. You could not possibly bring *sins* to the Father. The fact is, He might come in grace to sinful man, but it is not sinful man who goes to the Father.
Ques. What is the force of "shall die in your sins"?
F.E.R. It is the totality of it -- the climax of all.
Ques. It is really only as Christ is formed in us that we touch the Father, is it not?
F.E.R. Yes. It is only in love that you touch the Father. A sinful man, as such, does not touch the Father, because touching the Father involves the *calling*, and that is *sons*. Sinful man, as such, has no place there.
Ques. And therefore it is necessary that the Father should quicken?
F.E.R. Yes. The Father's love could only be known by the quickening of the Father.
Ques. How does "The Son quickeneth whom he will" come in?
F.E.R. Well, that takes in the whole thing, as I understand it. When the time comes for a public work, then I think the Son quickens whom He will. It contemplates the complete thing, not merely that which is moral or spiritual. It includes the quickening of the body. I always connect it with, "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming". Of course, that verse you quote has a present application, for the Lord immediately goes on to that; but still I think the "quickeneth whom he will" goes on to the quickening of the body.
Rem. It is not until then that a man is really free.
F.E.R. Quite so.
{142}
Ques. "Ye are from beneath" (verse 23), what is that?
F.E.R. It is all moral; He was from above, they were from beneath.
Ques. Like "The first man is of the earth, earthy"?
F.E.R. Well, no, that is a little more definite. It is more like "The way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath". You must not make "above" and "beneath" to convey the sense of place. As a matter of fact, Satan is not "beneath" yet. I think these Jews understood it perfectly.
I do not think anything affords a more terrible exhibition of man -- of every one of us -- than the total inability of man to appreciate divine goodness. I feel it in myself. For instance, there is many a man of the world who would be very well content with a fortune, but, after all, what is the good of that? He may have it for a few years, but then he must leave it. Now the way God comes out is that He quickens; He makes man alive that he may enjoy His love for ever. If I had a fortune, I should not care to take it to heaven with me.
Ques. Is that the idea of the Son making you free?
F.E.R. Yes; delivering a man from every hindrance, so that he may have the liberty of the house. It is impossible for a man to be in a greater light than Christ was, and He was in the full light of the Father's love. "The light" is God revealed as Father.
Rem. We have been used to contrast light and love.
F.E.R. Yes. But it is the greatest mistake. What is that light which exposes? It is the full revelation of God. God reveals the very best thing, that is, His love, and it is that which exposes man.
Rem. You see that very best thing revealed to Saul of Tarsus, "a light above the brightness of the sun".
{143}
F.E.R. Yes. But he was subdued by it. These Jews were not subdued by it, and there are Christians who are not subdued by it. I see people going on, and yet they make no progress. It is not that I want to un-Christianise them, but I see that they stagnate.
Rem. I suppose that before the church departed from its first love their position was perfectly evident, but nowadays many people get converted, and they never know what it is.
F.E.R. No, never. You see, the church was the vessel of the testimony, and not the evangelist; but when the church lost its place of testimony, then the gospel was very greatly affected. Then they got into the idea, pretty much as it is at the present day, that it was the glad tidings of the *grace*, but really it is the glad tidings of the *glory*. Many a man has become a saved man, but he has not reached the glad tidings of the glory, which is what God wants him to have. Nothing else will greatly affect him. Man enjoys grace, but the sense of it may become dim. The right way to really get into it is to get into the light of the glory, and then you will have a still greater sense of the grace.
Rem. Not only to be *detached* but *attached*.
F.E.R. Yes. It is the glad tidings of the glory that attaches a man to God.
Ques. What do you understand by the "glory"?
F.E.R. It is the moral effulgence of God that shines out in the gospel; not simply that you have salvation for man, but every attribute of God displayed. I think the point just raised is of the last moment -- that is, the effect of the failure of the church on the gospel itself. The church was really set here to be the vessel of the testimony, and it is as evident as possible that people take their idea of Christianity from the company in which they got converted, such as the Church of England, for instance, or any of the other systems. If a man is converted among us, he will, in like manner,
{144}
form his idea of Christianity, to a large extent, from us -- and he will not get much from it. What I feel is this -- and another has urged it -- that there are two things which are very poorly known among us: deliverance and the divine nature.
Ques. Do you think that a man would take his ideas more from the one used in his conversion?
F.E.R. Well, I think you will find he will take his ideas very much more from what he is brought into contact with -- it is that which will principally mould him. He is greatly affected by the preacher, no doubt, but, in their own thoughts, you will find people connect the preacher with some "Body". The likelihood is that a convert will ask the preacher where he belongs.
Ques. What is the antidote for these things?
F.E.R. Well, the only remedy, as I see it, is that we should be in deliverance, and walk in the light of the divine nature. At the same time, I think it is a very great thing to present the glad tidings of the glory.
Rem. A person is ready to be affected by the preacher.
F.E.R. Yes, he is. But the fact is, you cannot see the thing really in practice except in a company. We have not "increased" as we should. We have increased in light, but I should be afraid to say much as to our increase in other ways -- I mean the "increase of God" in the divine nature and the enjoyment of deliverance and unworldliness.
Ques. What is really meant by "the divine nature"?
F.E.R. Well, the divine nature is love; that is the one word which expresses it.
Rem. My thought as to the remedy was that one should give oneself more to the study of God's word.
F.E.R. Well, I do not know, but I would rather set more on *prayer*, if I might say so. With regard to the study of the word, you cannot understand the word apart from the *state* to understand it. In @Ephesians 1
{145}
the apostle prays that God might give them the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, the eyes of their heart being enlightened, that they might *know* -- it is divine power to give you the *state* that you may know. And then in chapter 3 it is "Strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, *may be able* to comprehend with all saints", etc. You could not get at it simply by the study of Scripture, but you have to bow to God, and to look to Him that He may give you the spirit of wisdom. I was an ardent student of Scripture at one time, but I do not think I got things in that way -- not that I have much any way at all.
Ques. But has not your study of Scripture been very useful to you?
F.E.R. Well, yes, because, after all, it is a very great thing for a man to be set upon something -- for many Christians seem to be so dreadfully wanting in purpose, so earthly in their ways, and all that kind of thing. But then you want more than that, you want *purpose*; and when a man is a diligent student of Scripture, and God sees that man as a man of purpose, God comes in to give him *state*, in order that he may be able to enter into things.
Rem. He needs divine preparation to understand the things of God.
F.E.R. Yes. You must first get the *state* from God to receive them. I think you get it by bowing yourself in the presence of God, to get, by His favour, the *state* by which you can understand His mind.
Ques. When was verse 28 accomplished: "When ye have lifted up the Son of man"?
F.E.R. I think it must have come home to them very specially in the testimony of Stephen. His testimony was to the exaltation of Christ; it was not to His lifting up on the cross, but the testimony of His glory; and the testimony was undeniable. There was
{146}
the gift of the Holy Spirit, and then the overwhelming testimony of Stephen. They knew, I believe, that Christ was what He said He was.
Rem. But this refers to the lifting up on the cross.
F.E.R. Yes. I was thinking of the other point, "*When* ye shall have lifted up", etc., "*then* shall ye know".
Rem. Stephen speaks of their refusal as wilful sin.
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. Is there any moral force in His being "lifted up"?
F.E.R. It is always so in John. It was a demonstration, it was putting Christ into the place of demonstration, into the place where it could be demonstrated what the true place of man was. They made a spectacle of Him; put Him into the place of curse and judgment -- man's own proper place; but the crowning act of wickedness became the crowning act of blessing for man.
CHAPTER 9: 30 TO 10: 18
Rem. It appears as if there had been a spiritual work in this blind man as well as his natural eyesight being given to him.
F.E.R. I should almost think so.
Ques. Would you say he was a kind of typical man in relation to the new company?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. The point is in what the Lord says to him, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?" Not "the Christ", but "the Son of God". Then the man answers, "Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee. And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him".
Rem. I can see the new company in chapters 13 and 14, but I do not quite see how it is brought in
{147}
here. I would like to have the idea of these chapters.
F.E.R. Well, I think what you get here is the formation of the company. I do not think you get quite that in chapters 13 and 14. There the company is assumed. It is not quite the flock, as here. Here you have the one flock and the one Shepherd, answering to Jew and Gentile builded together. The point in chapter 14 is what is preparatory to their being a witness for Christ.
Rem. Here it is proving His own suitability to be Shepherd.
F.E.R. Yes. In chapter to you see the Lord coming definitely into the fold to lead out the sheep. The whole chapter is not occupied with the great point that He was to be rejected, but He comes into the fold in order to lead the sheep out. Then when the sheep are led out -- and they are the elect of God -- there is the election from among the Gentiles brought in, and one flock is formed, with one Shepherd.
Ques. What is the moral link between this chapter and @1 Corinthians 10 as to separation? The man here is brought into separation from all but Christ, and so, too, the man in 1 Corinthians to has to be separate from everything here.
F.E.R. Yes. But then in 1 Corinthians to the separation is the man's own doing -- I mean it is fellowship in the death of Christ, he takes that ground; but the point in @John 9 is that the man is cast out by the Jews.
Rem. But they both reach the same point.
F.E.R. Yes. You see, the Lord allowed them to cast the man out really in order to break the links which bound him to the Jew. The fact is, if they had not cast him out, you would find it extremely difficult to understand how he could have broken with them. The Jew, by his own perverseness and contrariety, brought in the counsel of God. It is difficult to understand how the church ever would have been
{148}
formed if not for the perverseness of the Jew. I really think that those who were converted in the beginning of the Acts would have been quite content to remain where they were -- to be identified still with the temple-worship. You read that "a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith". It was just the perverseness of the Jews that forced them out.
Rem. The great point in this passage is the giving up of man down here, the being characterised by having reached the Son of God.
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
Rem. But the Lord Himself goes out through death.
F.E.R. Yes, literally He did, but all through the chapter He never attributes His death to man. He says in chapter 10, "I lay down my life"; and again, "I lay down my life for the sheep". You do not see the hand of man in it at all.
Rem. And it was for His own flock.
F.E.R. Yes; for the sheep.
Rem. And His death was the door for them to go out.
F.E.R. Yes, quite so.
Rem. His love for them was proved in that way.
F.E.R. Yes. And "therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father".
Rem. It is His love in this sense that is presented in the Supper.
F.E.R. Yes. What is presented to us is His death, and His love in His death. You see, it is all His own act -- "my body, which is given for you", "my blood which is shed for you".
In chapter 9 the one who is forced out really goes out before the Lord. It is in chapter 10 that the Lord
{149}
reveals that He Himself is going out of the fold; He was about to take that course Himself. I do not think the Lord ever took any particular course consequent upon the rejection of Himself by the Jew. He only takes it as an occasion to reveal the character in which He had been acting all along. When things come out and are developed in their true character, He then reveals what had been before Him from the outset. Take, for instance, the parable of the sower; you might think that that came out consequent upon His rejection by the Jew. But no, He only reveals the character of His acting all along; He had been sowing from the outset. So here, He had been the Shepherd of the sheep all along, though He does not bring that out at first.
Rem. He had really been the Shepherd of those who were His own, but it was not brought out.
F.E.R. No. The Lord really reveals what was the true object of His coming here when rejected of the Jews. You see, the Jew was tested -- the very presence of the Lord down here tested him, he was bound to be tested by the presence of the Lord -- but, for all that, He had really come here with a very definite object before Him.
Ques. An object only known to Himself, I suppose?
F.E.R. No one knew anything about it. It could only be known by His speaking about it.
Rem. And yet it was testified to in the Scriptures.
F.E.R. Well, no, I do not think that. They did not testify to the church, and that was the object for which the Lord really came. You get that coming out in the parable of the merchantman in Matthew; "one pearl of great price" is the church.
Rem. What comes out in this chapter is a great advance on chapter 4, where they say, "We believe ... that this is indeed the Christ".
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. Here it is, "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?"
{150}
Ques. That is His title as on the other side of death?
F.E.R. Well, I think it was a title which was evidenced and confirmed in resurrection; @Romans 1.
Ques. And is not that the basis of the new company?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. That is Paul's testimony. "He preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God".
Ques. Does not that, in fact, give the nature of the blessing into which the company is brought?
F.E.R. Yes. "When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons". That was the object for which the Son was sent forth, that we might receive sonship.
Rem. Not simply that He might bring in the kingdom of God.
F.E.R. Oh, no. The kingdom of God comes in by the way, but the definite purpose of God lay underneath that, it had reference to the church.
Rem. It would appear so from the passage, He "loved the church, and gave himself for it".
Ques. When the apostle preached the kingdom of God, had they to come into the church through the kingdom?
F.E.R. Well, as a matter of fact, a man must begin with the kingdom of God. He certainly could not advance one step farther if he did not accept the moral sway of God; but then I think that is only the beginning of things, and he then gets instructed as to the purpose of God.
Rem. He is then in a condition to enter into the purpose of God.
Rem. His coming here with a definite object before Him really invests the path of the Lord with a peculiar dignity.
F.E.R. Yes. The kingdom of God really belongs
{151}
to *this* order of things, but the church belongs to the order of the new creation. The kingdom of God in itself does not consist of the new heavens and the new earth -- it does not belong to the new creation. It is God assuming the reins of government, and ruling in this order of things. It is the seventh day. But that is not so with the church, which belongs to a new order of things altogether, to new creation.
Ques. Are not both touched on in what the Lord says to Peter, "On this rock I will build my assembly", and then, "I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven"?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
Ques. In what way would you say He came into the world for "judgment"?
F.E.R. Well, in chapter 9 they excommunicated the blind man, and why? The only possible ground they could have had for it was that he had made a kind of confession of the One who had opened his eyes. But what sin could there have been in that? The Lord fully exposes their motives. He was the Light exposing everything contrary to it. The Lord was the expression of what was in the heart of God towards man, and they were not affected by the light in chapter 8; and hated what was God's work in chapter 9. Both the light of God and the work of God exposed them fully, and things were brought to an issue: "Now is the judgment of this world".
Ques. And is not that true still?
F.E.R. I think so. In Christendom things are mixed up again, but then, I think, we have to retire from all that to realise that things have really been brought to an issue.
Rem. Morally settled before God.
F.E.R. Yes. The Jew has been completely tested, and his position exposed.
Rem. And that would include man generally.
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
{152}
Ques. If man under God's culture was so completely exposed, where could other men come in?
F.E.R. But do you think that man in the present day would care for God to come near him, to come close to him? No; what I see is that they try very carefully indeed to keep God at a distance; they do not deny Him, but keep carefully at a distance.
Rem. But they often speak of God's love.
F.E.R. Yes. But their idea is that God will let them do what they like and never bring them to account. They do not understand divine love a bit. To let them run their own course, and never bring them to account, is their idea of love.
Rem. It is a wonderful step onwards for this man to be placed in the company of the Son of God!
F.E.R. Yes. But that could not come to pass until that which stood on the ground of profession had been completely exposed. The coming in of the Lord had that immediate effect.
Rem. And there was nothing in man.
F.E.R. No. He is affected neither by the word of God, nor by the work of God. The word of God did not subdue him in chapter 8, nor the work of God in chapter 9; they refused both.
Rem. I suppose, in other words, the fig-tree has to be cut down.
F.E.R. Exactly. Man, as such, is not affected either by the word or the work of God. He is hopeless.
Rem. He knows nothing more about the work of God today than at the time we are occupied with in the chapter.
F.E.R. Quite so. He may *see* it, in a way. Supposing a man is converted, other people *see* it, but they only laugh at it.
Ques. What do the disciples mean when they say, "Who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?"
F.E.R. They were looking at him as born in sin
{153}
because he was born blind, it was the common Jewish idea; but the Lord tells them it was neither the man himself nor his parents.
Rem. But he is brought to the front as a special object of the work of God.
F.E.R. Yes. But he had not sinned, if I may say so, absolutely or finally. "Sin" in John is the rejection of Christ. "Now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father" -- that is the character of sin in John, and this man had not in that way sinned nor his parents. The Jew was in danger of sinning absolutely, and in fact they had done so when they refused the light.
You get the same thing in regard to the gospel, which is "the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ". When it came to man, he refused it. That is sin absolutely; there is no forgiveness for it.
Rem. One experiences great difficulty in reaching the Lord in this outside place.
F.E.R. Well, in order to reach Him there you must pass through the process given in these two chapters. There is no affinity between the natural heart and God's word and His work, and you must go through the experience presented here.
Ques. Is it analogous at all to Peter's leaving the boat?
F.E.R. Yes, it is in a way. Leaving the boat is, to some extent, analogous to leaving the fold, as here.
Rem. Only now there is no boat.
F.E.R. No. But you have come to the apprehension of Christ in the character in which He came.
Ques. As "good shepherd"?
F.E.R. Yes. But He came to lead the sheep out, not to leave them in the fold. He puts them forth. They had to be led out of the system of ordinances in which they were found as Jews, and they had to be relieved from the judgment of death that rested on
{154}
them. These two things were essential to the sheep; they were to be saved, and to go in and out and find pasture.
Rem. How very little we have touched the Son of God outside of everything!
F.E.R. Yes. But the moment we touch Him in that way, reach Him in that way, we reach the church.
Ques. Is it that you live by faith of Him, as in @1 John 5: 5, "Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?"
F.E.R. That is touching Him by faith; but here it brings in quite another thought. You reach Him in His nature, and that is where the truth of the church comes in.
Rem. I suppose the character of a sheep is indicated by his partaking of the divine nature: "I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine, as the Father knows me and I know the Father".
Rem. That is a most wonderful statement.
F.E.R. Yes. It is something like what is in Galatians, "When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law"; they had to be redeemed out of that position in order that they might receive sonship. That is very analogous to @John 10.
Ques. What is the force of His entering in by the door into the sheepfold?
F.E.R. The answer is in what has just been quoted. It is not simply that He was made of a woman, but He was made under the law, and that in order that He might redeem His sheep out of it. They were brought into the new position, and because they are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into their hearts. It is the power of the Holy Spirit which qualifies for the new position. Therefore the Lord, as in this chapter, comes into the fold -- He is made under the law -- so that He may lead out the sheep, and when
{155}
that is done He goeth before them, and the sheep follow Him.
Ques. Would you compare that with what you get in chapter 5, the voice of the Son of God in death; they know His voice?
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. But then He has come into death that we may be relieved from the pressure of it.
Ques. "To him the porter openeth" -- what is that?
F.E.R. Well, the great point in that is that He came into the fold legitimately, and therefore the porter opened to Him.
Ques. It has been said that the porter is the Holy Spirit?
F.E.R. I do not see that that is the idea. It is a figurative expression, and is used to convey the teaching that He came into the fold in a legitimate way that He might have access to the sheep. He came after the divine order.
Ques. Is there not a good deal the thought in people's minds as to following the Lord down here without death?
Rem. They think they can follow Him naturally.
F.E.R. Yes. There are sentimental books by the score putting Christ as an example. It is a very remarkable thing to see in the gospels that the Lord never gave much encouragement to volunteers. He called a man to follow Him, but if a man volunteered to follow Him, He put the difficulties before him. You see, if a man sets out to follow the Lord without invitation, he follows Him as long as it pleases himself; but what is the good of that?
Rem. Self-confidence must be broken down.
F.E.R. Yes; and all that kind of thing is a secret between oneself and the Lord, and one does not care to talk much about it. A man may be tested by the difficulties, but if he has really counted the cost he is prepared for them.
{156}
Ques. "That they which see might be made blind" -- what is that?
F.E.R. I suppose He is referring to their self-confidence. Jesus had said, "For judgment I am come into this world". He would judge the people who "see", who claimed to be competent to judge.
Ques. Do you think it is when the Lord is gone out of the fold that He becomes the door into a new world?
F.E.R. I think so. He takes up another figure, it is no longer a fold. The idea of a fold is dropped.
Ques. I suppose the going "in and out" would indicate liberty.
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. He came into the fold to lead the elect of God out of the legal system of things, and to relieve them from the pressure of death which was upon them. You get the idea of it in @Colossians 2, "Having forgiven you all trespasses; blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us ... and having spoiled principalities and powers". "And you ... hath he quickened", having done all that.
Rem. And in the assembly we are in a position outside of all that has to do with our responsible life here.
F.E.R. Quite so; you appreciate the good of the "one flock" and the "one shepherd". Christ has come into this scene in order to lead us out of it.
Ques. "Risen with Christ" really applies to the assembly, not to the individual?
F.E.R. Yes. The moment you come to Jordan, you properly drop all that is individual to become identified with the ark of the covenant, and then you come on to what is corporate and collective; and therefore the manna ceases, because it is connected with the individual path, and you come to the "old corn of the land". That is not for us individually, but collectively in a certain sense.
Ques. Do you not think that the individual line so
{157}
often detains us that we do not get on to the line of God's purpose?
Rem. But we have a good deal to learn individually.
F.E.R. Yes. We have to learn everything individually; and Scripture always takes up the part which is individual before it touches what is collective.
Ques. And the brazen serpent is individual?
F.E.R. - Yes. The brazen serpent is properly for the land -- it closes up the ground of responsibility, and they enter the land in virtue of a new life. Life is individual, and therefore the truth of it comes out in the wilderness, but you do not get the sphere of life until you get through Jordan. There are a vast number of Christians who know and enjoy life individually, but who never will know what the land is this side of heaven. The secret is that they give the preference to social life. They want piety in their social life. But if you cross Jordan, you are brought to the assembly, and then the social thing becomes quite secondary. You are identified with the ark of the covenant, and the prominent point is not death, but resurrection. By the light of Christ and the assembly you know how to carry out the social relations; and that is why the natural relationships are brought out in Colossians and Ephesians, to put them in their proper place in relation to the assembly, or rather to Christ. The assembly is collective, and everything is to be carried out in the light of it, and the relation of Christ to the church becomes the standard even for man and wife.
Rem. I do not come to Him as "Lord" in the assembly.
F.E.R. But you come to Him as the Living Stone. You come to Him in His identification with us. As Lord He is not identified with us. "Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well". He is that to us individually, but as the Living Stone He is
{158}
identified with us and we with Him. It is of all moment, if you want to understand anything at all about the assembly, to see His identification with us, and ours with Him. "He that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one".
Rem. That is beyond the thought of the Saviour.
F.E.R. Yes. You have tasted that the Lord is gracious, and then "To whom coming, as unto a living stone", etc.; that is the next step.
Ques. Does it not all hang upon verse 10: "that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly"?
F.E.R. They could not be in it at all except as relieved from death.
Ques. What is "more abundantly"?
F.E.R. Certainly not the idea of two infusions of it. It is the character of it.
Ques. Alluding to the Spirit's coming, I suppose?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
Ques. In its full character?
F.E.R. Yes, the "well of water springing up into everlasting life". They were to have it in its fulness, not in any stinted way.
Ques. What is the force of the verse in chapter 14, "Because I live, ye shall live also"?
F.E.R. You live in correspondence to Him, in concert with Him.
Ques. That is more than mere dependence?
F.E.R. Oh, yes. You are completely outside the whole course of things down here. He goes on to say, "At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you". It was what separated Him from the world. He never was in the world; He was in the Father, and then you are "in me". Even when He was in the world He lived because of the Father.
{159}
Rem. In chapter 16 He lives in another sphere and He associates us with Him in it.
F.E.R. Yes; and He says, "I will come to you". Everything was so clear that He could come to them. They had no comfort in the world, but He says, "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you", and "because I live, ye shall live also".
You may depend upon it there is nothing less known than Christianity in the full power of it.
Rem. And we are conscious of how little we have entered into it.
F.E.R. Yes. I feel how little I know what it is to have the Lord on our side. I have been greatly encouraged lately, in connection with Philippians, to see how the Spirit of God by the apostle insists upon it, when everything had come to confusion in the church. What is depicted in chapter 1 is not a very exhilarating state of things: they were preaching Christ of envy and strife; even the apostle himself was under the world-power. It was a state of things very like the present time: the church today is under the world-power. But when you come to chapter 2 you find him exhorting the saints to be "blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation". The Christian company at Philippi was to come out in all its brightness: "among whom ye shine as lights in the world". It is very encouraging at the present time, even if you take into account the ruined state of the church. You can see a company coming out in the proper brightness of the church.
Rem. That is very encouraging. And that is the special point for which the Lord is working at the present time.
F.E.R. Yes; because He is coming. I think there is the energy of the Spirit of God working down here, and you are encouraged in God -- you do not look at man.
{160}
Paul was under the world-power, and that is where the church has been ever since. They have tried to govern the world-power -- that is what Roman Catholicism has tried to do -- but, nevertheless, it has turned the other way. Even in this country the head of the church is the queen. At the beginning of the Acts the church was opposed, not by the world-power, but by the religious power: the high priest and the council; but all that religious power was scattered to the winds. And then the effort was to corrupt the truth by introducing a Judaising element -- that was at Corinth -- and then it comes under the world-power. The apostle was bound at Rome.
Rem. "With the soldier who kept him".
F.E.R. Yes. He was the symbol of the world-power. But the word of God was not bound, and so he wanted the Philippians to come out in all the first brightness of the church.
Rem. Her shining "was like unto a stone most precious".
F.E.R. Yes. As he says here, "among whom ye shine as lights in the world".
What comes out in @John 10 is John's peculiar way of presenting the church. Paul would tell you of the body and the Head, but John tells you about the sheep and the Shepherd. It is the same thing, the same persons are spoken of -- they present the same thing in different lights. The Lord is speaking here to those who had the idea of the flock; Israel was Jehovah's flock, but now the Lord is revealing a flock and a Shepherd of a new character.
Ques. Is it the same as the true Vine?
F.E.R. Oh, no; that is a different idea altogether. He speaks there of the professing thing. Israel had been the vine, but the moment Christ came here, He was the Vine, and then fruit-bearing depended upon their being identified with Him. Here He is the good
{161}
Shepherd. He does not speak of Himself in that character at the beginning of the chapter; the proof and evidence of His being the good Shepherd is that He gave His life for the sheep. They were to be relieved from the pressure of death, they were to be saved, and to go in and out, and find pasture.
CHAPTER 10 (CONTINUED)
F.E.R. I think it is important to see that what comes out in this chapter, as we were noticing last time, is that the course which the Lord takes is not *new*, but that He came here definitely to the fold, to lead the sheep out of it. As we get elsewhere, "God sent forth his Son, come of woman, come under law, that he might redeem those under law, that we might receive sonship". There was a definite purpose in the sending out of God's Son. He came into the fold in the legitimate way, but it was to lead the sheep out.
Ques. I suppose you would say there were other things connected with His coming into the world?
F.E.R. Yes. But all else was secondary, and it is of all importance to see what the divine purpose of His coming into the fold was. All else that came out -- the testing and exposure of the Jew -- was incidental, and the result of that testing only proved the divine purpose for which Christ came. Exactly the same principle is seen in the parable of the sower to which we referred last time. He was the Sower from the outset. Here we see the divine purpose in His coming into the fold, and every other thought is subordinated to that.
Ques. The great point in the Supper is His love in death?
F.E.R. Yes. It is essential to get the divine sense of what He came here for.
Ques. The sheep who hear His voice were Jews, were they not?
{162}
F.E.R. Yes; that is plain, because the Lord says afterwards, "Other sheep I have". I think the thought in many people's minds is that He came here, and the Jews rejected Him, and that, when His own people would not have Him, then He took up another character.
Rem. I have had that kind of thought.
F.E.R. Yes; that when everything failed as to His presentation to the people, then He takes up another character as the Shepherd, and leads His own sheep out. But it is not so; He just reveals to them the true character in which He came; He had that character from the outset.
Rem. He knew all things from the beginning, but you have to wait until the testimony is rejected openly for the truth to come out.
F.E.R. Exactly. It is the occasion for bringing out the real purpose for which He came here. We have seen the steps leading up to it in chapters 8 and 9. You get the same thing in principle in the Acts. The testimony at the beginning was to the exaltation of Christ, and that if the Jews repented, God would send Him back to them. That was the testimony of the Holy Spirit then, but, at the same time, the Holy Spirit had really come to conduct the company to Christ in heaven.
Rem. It is just the presentation of the two things that has rather puzzled people.
Ques. Would you think the idea of the fold was really a restraint placed upon the flesh, that is, Judaism, and that what they were to be brought into is the liberty of love?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
Rem. It is all based upon what exists between the Father and the Son.
F.E.R. Yes, exactly.
Ques. What is your thought in, "I am the door"
{163}
(verse 9)? Would you say it is a moral sphere of blessing for them?
F.E.R. Yes. You do not come into any blessing except by Him.
Rem. Through His death.
F.E.R. Yes.
Rem. It is the company, the flock, that is in view here.
F.E.R. I think the Lord is working up to that.
Rem. And there is no inconsistency with other testimonies -- the Head and the body, the bride, and so on.
F.E.R. No; every one of them is but a figure.
Rem. We have had the thought that John is very individual.
F.E.R. I do not think a bit more so than Paul. Of course, when it is a question of life, everything must be individual. Quickening, and so on, must be individual, but then it all comes in to pave the way for the flock; and then, when you come to chapter 10, the flock comes into view, and, most undoubtedly, when you come to chapters 13, 14, 15 and 16, it is not individual. And in chapter 17, what the Lord is praying about is unity, "that they all may be one" -- that is the burden of His prayer.
Here, in verse 9, it is no longer a question of His entering into the fold, but, "I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture". He is not now leading out of the fold, but it is a question of entering in.
Ques. What does He refer to in verse 8, "thieves and robbers"?
F.E.R. I do not know much about it, but I suppose there had been people who had come with certain pretensions.
Ques. They were not the appointed ones. What about David?
F.E.R. Oh, but this refers to false Christs, to all
{164}
those who had come with pretensions that they were Messiah, or something of that kind. You certainly never read of a true prophet setting himself up to be any one.
Rem. As the prophet Amos says, "I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son".
F.E.R. Quite so; any true prophet would have disclaimed being anything at all, like John the Baptist.
Rem. There is some meaning in the expression, "a stranger" (verse 5).
F.E.R. I suppose the flock come to know the voice of the Shepherd; they have a kind of instinct, and the voice of a stranger means nothing to them.
Ques. Is the Lord referring to His death in verse 4?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. He left the fold by death, and we go the same way.
Ques. *His* death?
F.E.R. Yes, it is really so. The point is this: what Christ came into actually, we have to come to in *mind*. There is nothing for it but that. What I mean to say is this: He came into actual crucifixion and death, but we have to come into it in mind, and that is a very tedious road oftentimes, and we are not very willing to enter upon it. Every one has to come to it that there is nothing for *sin* but *death*, and that there is nothing for the flesh but crucifixion. It is not possible for God to do anything on the side where sin and the flesh are. All blessing is on the other side, the side of resurrection.
Rem. Like "through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead".
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. If God operated on that ground, and you are set upon being on that ground, then you have to reach death and crucifixion in *mind*.
Rem. That is a very important point to reach.
F.E.R. Yes. You will never get on to the truth of resurrection ground if you do not come in *mind* to
{165}
crucifixion. A man has to be set free from sin and the flesh, or he will not know at all what it is to be on resurrection ground with Christ.
I think the Lord speaks of Himself here as being the door of the sheep, because in death He would open a way for them: "By me". A man must enter in individually, but then if he does enter in, he gets to the other side, and finds himself in company. I know that these things are beset with a certain amount of difficulty, because we want to get everything on *this* side, but it is impossible. God cannot establish anything on this side, everything has to be wrought and effectuated on the other side -- the resurrection side. There are two things after all: first, everything must be effectuated where Satan has no power or rights, and, secondly, where there is nothing but the divine nature. That is what you come to on the other side -- Satan has no rights there, death cannot come, and everything is formed according to God in the divine nature. "He shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture".
Ques. How far does this go -- "he shall be saved"?
F.E.R. Well, I have thought that salvation really means that you are free from the judgment of God, and from the power of Satan. You are saved out of the midst of a scene where sin and Satan's power and death are.
Ques. What is the idea of a hireling?
F.E.R. What I see in it is that, in the present state of Christendom, there are plenty of thieves and plenty of hirelings. The people who came before Christ were thieves, and those who come after are hirelings. A hireling is one who serves for wages; people take up the position of "shepherds" for wages.
Rem. I suppose thieves and robbers and hirelings form one class.
F.E.R. Yes. The state of things may be different at different times. At one time there may be thieves,
{166}
and at another hirelings, but what marks them both is that they care not for the sheep.
Rem. That is practically what the Lord found in the temple. He speaks of it as "a den of thieves".
F.E.R. Yes. People -- the mass of clergymen, for instance, if they can get a better "living", do not hesitate to give up their present flock, they look upon it as a very proper advancement. There may be, and are, bright exceptions (I have known some of them), but still, they will, as a rule, leave a flock without very much compunction for a good "living". Of course, looking at it from another point of view, I think it is very unwise for any devoted Christian man to limit himself at all to one little flock, for if he has any gift whatever it is for the good of the whole flock. If a man understood the reality and purpose of the gift he would not care to limit himself.
Rem. A shepherd must know these things for himself before he can lead others.
F.E.R. Yes. And, after all, the essence of Christianity is that it raises the question, not of what you *know*, but of what you *are*. And a man's serviceability does not consist of what he knows, but of what he is -- he is not effective beyond that.
Rem. With the hireling, when the crucial moment arrives, he flees.
F.E.R. Yes. There is the possibility of the wolf coming in to scatter the sheep, and the hireling flees because he is a hireling; but if the shepherd is the leader of the sheep, he is the first one to be exposed to the danger; he is *before* and not *behind*, and therefore he is exposed to any assault. That is evident enough. The hireling flees to take care of himself, and leaves the sheep to take care of themselves. That only proves what he is.
Ques. What is your thought about the "abundant life"?
F.E.R. Well, life has to come in, and they were to
{167}
have it, not in any stinted measure -- there is no limit to life now. The only limit is the Holy Spirit, and you cannot limit Him. He is a "well of water springing up into everlasting life", and the water is inexhaustible. I think life depends on what God makes known, what the Holy Spirit makes known, in us. What limit could you have to the love of God? And it is the love of God which the Holy Spirit sheds abroad in our hearts. There is no life except in the Holy Spirit.
Rem. And that is eternal.
F.E.R. Yes. Because it is the other side of death. If you learn the love of God you are out of death. Death is annulled where love is revealed. Death was annulled in the cross, and Christ brought in the love of God, the testimony of God's love. "God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us". He died for us to abolish death, and if we live we live in the love of God, which is inexhaustible, immeasurable.
Rem. It is important to see that things are not repeated, and in chapter 4 the believer is looked at as having the Spirit.
F.E.R. Yes; that is my firm conviction. A statement is made, and you have to bear that in mind all the way through, the same ground is not gone over twice.
Ques. What about chapter 20, "He breathed on them"?
F.E.R. Well, He had spoken in anticipation, but when redemption is accomplished He makes it effectual. Everything in John is anticipative -- this whole chapter presupposes His death. His death proved Him to be the good Shepherd. Here He says, "I am the door" -- not "I am going to become the door". The idea is, I think, that it shuts you up to Him, there is no other door. I do not see how a man could possibly be saved except through His death.
{168}
Ques. And there is no other way of entering in but by His death?
F.E.R. No: "I am the door". I think He bases His title of good Shepherd on the idea of His giving His life for the sheep; it is expressive in Him of divine goodness.
Rem. It says, "more abundantly" in verse 10. It would read better, "very abundantly".
F.E.R. "More" gives rather a wrong impression in regard to it, as though there were two stages -- "life", and "more abundantly", but that is not the idea at all.
Rem. But we used to think that we had "life" here, and the "more abundantly" in chapter 20.
F.E.R. Well, the secret of that was that it was not seen that life was in the Holy Spirit.
Rem. Yes; it was "life" in the old order that people had, and then "more abundantly" was the gift of the Holy Spirit: that when He breathed on them it was "life more abundantly".
Rem. The New Translation puts it very simply, and confirms fully what has been put before us.
Ques. What is the idea of "go in and out"?
F.E.R. It is expressive of liberty. They used to say, "went *in* to worship, and *out* to service". I do not care for these expressions myself. The idea is simply liberty.
Rem. I never was very happy about it myself, because I wanted to know *where* it was I went out to service. There is no reference to *place* in it, or of service.
F.E.R. Now the wonderful thing is that you are kept by what is *within* you; the Jews were kept by the fold, but now you are kept from *within*, you do not want four walls.
Rem. I suppose the fold was the system of ordinances, etc. The sheep were kept guarded in that way.
{169}
Ques. Does the "middle wall of partition" refer to the same kind of thing?
F.E.R. Yes, in some respects; but then it was an enclosure in which God saw fit to keep His people; it was a middle wall of partition between them and the nations, but now that is broken down. The passage (@Ephesians 2) goes on to say, "Through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father". It is in the Spirit you have everything now -- salvation, liberty, and pasture -- so that you do not want any enclosure. Men have been busy in building up enclosures for themselves. The Roman Catholics will tell you there is no salvation outside the church, and neither is there, at all events there is none outside the Holy Spirit.
The "hireling" principle prevails to a very large extent in Christendom today. Now suppose you were to be joined to some chapel, and had a paid minister (and that minister might be a godly man enough), and you may look to him for guidance, but what security have you for doctrine? People get to depend upon their minister for doctrine. That has been proved abundantly to be a rickety foundation with ministering brethren of any kind, You may depend upon the power that is within you. Christ is the Object of faith, and you are, at the same time, dependent upon the anointing you have received from the Holy One. The Spirit keeps you in the faith of Christ, and in liberty too. Christendom has gone back to the very thing the Lord died to deliver the flock from.
Rem. Only now it is not *one* fold, but many.
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. I only mentioned it to show how folds and enclosures have been set up; but now, in contrast to that, a man is kept by that which is *within* him -- the Spirit of God. It is only by the death of Christ, of course, that you can come on to the new platform.
{170}
Ques. What is the idea of the good Shepherd in verses 11 and 14?
F.E.R. He is laying the foundation in verse 11, and in verse 14 He is bringing them into all the good of it. In verse 11 He is giving distinct proof that He *is* the good Shepherd, but in verse 14 He tells you very much more what the good Shepherd means. You get the full expression in Him, the perfect expression of divine goodness. He knows His sheep, but knows them as God knows them in divine goodness. You would not know the Shepherd unless you loved Him, and His knowledge of the sheep is in divine goodness -- "as I know the Father" -- it is all divine goodness in character.
It is noticeable that when the young man came to Him, calling Him "good", the Lord turned it aside -- "Why callest thou me good?" If they addressed Him as a *man*, He would not accept the title "good", but, on the other hand, if they regarded Him as the One in whom divine goodness was expressed, then it was a different matter altogether. It brings in, as you see, the mutuality of affection between the Father and the Son -- the bond of love. No one could gainsay that for a moment: "love, which is the bond of perfectness" -- and what could you have more than "perfectness"? It is all of that character -- it is the knowledge of the divine nature: "rooted and grounded in love".
It is wonderful to hear the good Shepherd saying, "I know my sheep". Think of what it is to be known of Christ, and then, too, "I am known of mine"; but we only know Him as we are responsive to His love. To believe in Him is one thing, but it is by love that you know Him -- not by faith, but by love, and no one knows Him any other way.
Ques. When the statement is repeated, it is, "I lay down my life for the sheep". Is that the measure of His love?
{171}
F.E.R. Well, it is the expression of it, it is not the consummation of it. It is a circumstance in the pathway of love. There is no greater love than to die for one's friend, but with Christ Himself it is a circumstance (and withal how wonderful!) in the pathway of His love. The consummation of love is properly to bring them into the Father's house. I believe it is most important for us to see this, because, do you not see love *preceded* His death, and love *follows* it? there is no change in the love. What is expressed abides as an unchanging love. Although it has such a wonderful expression, the love is not *gone* in death. I attach as much importance to His death as anybody, but what I would press is that it is a circumstance in the pathway of His love.
Ques. A means to an end?
F.E.R. Yes.
Rem. David, in @Psalm 78, is spoken of as a good shepherd, but then he was prophetic of Christ.
F.E.R. Yes. I may say that there cannot be anything more awful than the attitude of the Jews in this scripture. All testimony is rejected, and you see nothing but poor, contemptible cavilling on the part of the people, who did not understand one bit of what the Lord was speaking to them.
Rem. Redemption brings everything to those who know their need of it.
F.E.R. Exactly. That is the whole secret of blessing.
Rem. That verse in Corinthians, "The natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God" comes in here.
F.E.R. Yes, quite so; "they are spiritually discerned".
Rem. One characteristic of the sheep is that "they know his voice".
F.E.R. Yes; and that was the fruit of divine
{172}
work in them: "My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all".
Rem. He rejects the Jews with all their pretensions; they *said* that they saw, which only proved their blindness. It is not that the Lord ever rejects people because they are poor, miserable sinners.
F.E.R. No, indeed; the Lord never rejects such; it is people like those in Laodicea whom the Lord rejects, because they say, "I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing". Then "their sin remaineth".
Rem. I have sometimes wondered that it should say here, "it was winter".
F.E.R. Well, morally it was winter to the Jew -- the Lord was leaving them. It is like that verse: "The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved".
Rem. You have said nothing about verses 17 and 18, "I lay down my life, that I might take it again.... This commandment have I received of my Father".
F.E.R. I think it is that He does nothing whatever independently of the Father; but here He was acting as a divine Person, and as such could claim to do anything that God did. But He never took the place of God here, although a divine Person. As He says in chapter 2, "Destroy this temple, and in three days *I* will raise it up". He could claim to do all that God might do, but He never took the place of God, He ever was in the truth of the place He had taken as Man.
Rem. And yet there were things He could not have said except as being God. He could not be other than He was.
F.E.R. Yes. Whatever ground He took as a Man here, He could claim to do all that God did. "This commandment have I received of my Father". You see that they never understood, in all these statements, that it was really the Father who spoke; whatever the Lord said, it was the Father who spoke.
{173}
There is another remarkable thing in this chapter: all through His death is not attributed to man, it is the good Shepherd laying down His life for the sheep in divine goodness. The object the Lord had before Him was to bring the sheep out -- He ignores man completely. "No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself". Divine goodness expressed itself in that way.
In verse 16 it is the entire flock that is in view -- Jew and Gentile. "I have other sheep which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one flock, one shepherd". There can be no difference between that and the thought of the one body -- it is only a different figure. A shepherd is a head, only the thought of the Head brings out the pre-eminence of Christ, just as a husband supports a wife; whereas the idea of a shepherd is that He leads the sheep. It is in that way that the sheep are led really into worship, and it may be into the light of divine counsels. That is where the Shepherd comes in. The Shepherd dies for the sheep; Christ dies for the church. Every figure serves to bring out some more wonderful phase. All these different ideas converge towards the same point, and merge in one another. If you could get them all as a whole, you would have a perfect blaze of light; but the only one who could do that is the Holy Spirit, whose work is to put them together in you, as you are able to take them in.
CHAPTER 10: 22 TO END
F.E.R. The controversy which goes on in this part of the chapter only tends to make the rejection of the Jews more distinct.
Rem. I suppose they would think that if any people in the world were the sheep of God, they were the people.
{174}
F.E.R. Yes; and the words of the Lord caused a division among them. Some said, "He hath a devil and is mad: why hear ye him?" while others said "These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?" People carp at the Scriptures in exactly the same way today. Their great anxiety seems to be to get rid of the authority of the Scriptures, and yet they cannot leave them alone. They do not like the Scriptures any more than the Jews liked Christ.
Rem. And it was just the same with the Lord, they could not let Him alone. Would you say it proved their hatred of God?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. The great idea seems to be to get rid of any light from God, any testimony from God.
Rem. The time will come when the Lord will let them alone. He did this with the Jews even here in a certain sense.
F.E.R. Yes: "Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind". A great many people in the present day think they have disposed of the Scriptures, but they will find out their mistake. There is a living character about the Scriptures; the moment they come in contact with faith they become living. "The word of God is living", it has that character. Of course, as *far* as the mere book goes, that is simply the "letter", but the moment you get the Scriptures in contact with faith, then it becomes evident that the word of God is living, faith can use it in that way; it is the living word of God.
Rem. What you said about the Scriptures having a certain character about them, which is undeniable, could be said also about the Lord Himself.
F.E.R. Yes. There were certain things about the Lord which made Him totally different from anybody else, and it is the same with the Scriptures; they are totally unlike anything else. No human composition,
{175}
for example, has such a character as the Psalms, neither is there any human composition which can compare with the Proverbs. Plenty of proverbs have been written, but they have evidently no common ground with the Proverbs of Solomon.
Rem. But what was of that character in the Lord was only seen by those who had their eyes opened.
F.E.R. But there must have been certain features which marked the Lord off from other men -- I mean purely moral traits.
Rem. As when the soldiers returned and said, "Never man spake like this man".
F.E.R. Yes, and that was from His opponents.
Rem. It was no new thing to them, as we see from their own words: "How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly" (verse 24).
F.E.R. No. It is the very same principle continually at work with the enemy. It is a very difficult thing to make the Scriptures plain to the natural man.
Rem. Their state was not right for it.
F.E.R. Well, I think they wanted the Lord to do what He never would do, that is, to assert Himself. He did the Father's works, and spoke the Father's words, and there was no self-assertion about Him. I think man can understand self-assertion, and that is just what will characterise the Antichrist. "He sits in the temple of God" -- that is self-assertion; but you see there was nothing of that kind on the part of the Lord, though, at the same time, there was the strongest possible testimony as to who He was. He says, "The works that I do ... they bear witness of me".
It is perfectly certain that, through the whole of the gospel of John He is dealing only with what is the work of the Father, and He rejects all else. He repudiates everything that is of man. Even their claim in chapter 8 to be Abraham's children the Lord repudiates entirely. "He knew what was in man".
{176}
Men's opinions are simply nothing, the real point is what there is of Christ there.
Ques. Do you think they hated Him because He exposed them?
F.E.R. Yes. Man, as such, does not want the light of God. "He that doeth truth cometh to the light", but, you see, there was nothing of that in them.
Ques. Is not the idea of "children" in Scripture moral resemblance to their father?
F.E.R. Yes; and the Lord says to these unbelieving Jews, "Ye are of your father the devil" -- they were morally of him.
Rem. That thought comes out in the sermon on the mount: "Be ye therefore perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect".
F.E.R. Yes; and so in Philippians, they were to be "blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke". It is really a divine generation coming out, a state which has been formed in man by the power of the Holy Spirit. I do not think that many people are alive to what Paul says in Romans, "In my flesh dwelleth no good thing"; even the best unconverted man that ever was has nothing good within him. That is the conclusion to which you must come, however distasteful it may be. You have to accept it first, and to find it out as a reality afterwards. Very many people in the present day will tell you that there *is* good in man, and some of the most eminent men in the present day have been bent upon bringing out the good that is said to be in man. A great headmaster revolutionised the public schools of his day by saying that Christianity could cultivate that supposed "good" in man; but the most that sort of thing could do was to make people grow up manly, and honest, and truthful -- a very poor result, as far as God is concerned, and in itself quite negative. The teaching of @Romans 7 is a very different thing, though it is very hard to reach it.
{177}
Rem. Yes; and made harder to a man who is outwardly good, and honest, and truthful, as many are, than to those who are outwardly sinful.
F.E.R. Yes; you can see how the thing works.
Rem. What is sometimes urged against it is the case of the young man on whom the Lord looked and of whom it is said, "He loved him".
F.E.R. Yes; and I think you do meet people in the world who have such an amount of amiability that you cannot but be drawn to them, but you cannot trust it where there is no work of God.
Rem. The "touchstone" has not come.
F.E.R. No. The best unconverted man that ever breathed has no appreciation of God, or of His goodness. If a man appreciates the goodness of God, that man will reflect it, and you will never get real goodness in man in any other way. You must be in the joy of the goodness of God.
Ques. But it is right to give children a moral training?
F.E.R. Well, it is better to give them a Christian training; I know what you mean -- to give a true sense of right and wrong; but it is so different with a Christian, he does not judge as man judges, he is in the light of God.
Ques. Do you remember Stanley's sermon on "Gather up the fragments that remain"? He made it to apply to gathering up the fragments of good in man, that nothing should be lost, and to make use of them.
Ques. Is it not iniquity to look for good in man now?
F.E.R. Well, it is the blind leading the blind. The fact is, things are so entangled in Christendom now that you could not pronounce on it in that way. I believe this, that the best man naturally that ever breathed has no pleasure in the ways of God. For
{178}
example, you attempt to explain to him such a thing as "Mount Zion", that man will not be attracted, he will be bored by it. He has no appreciation of the goodness of God, and if you were to press things you would soon bring out the enmity. The very beginning with a Christian, the beginning of his birthright, is Mount Zion, but what does an unconverted man care about Mount Zion? He likes to be truthful and conscientious, and would have other people the same, but what does he care about Mount Zion?
Rem. He could be all that without God.
F.E.R. Yes; without recognising, on the one hand, the ruin of man -- man's fall -- and on the other hand, the sovereign mercy of God.
Rem. Goodness that no evil could conquer!
F.E.R. Quite so; so that He brings back to God, on the ground of redemption, much more than was lost. An unconverted person does not appreciate that.
Rem. Where there is a work of God in the soul it is, "My sheep hear my voice".
F.E.R. Exactly so. It is this in chapter 5, as we have seen, where they hear the voice of the Son of God. He is the touchstone, and the dead hear His voice and live; the voice of the Son of God is the touchstone.
Rem. He draws a very sharp distinction between the Jews and the true flock.
F.E.R. Yes. "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them", etc. It is a wonderful succession of statements. It is remarkable there are just seven of them -- perfection of blessing.
Ques. Would you say that this verse is for security?
F.E.R. Oh, I think so. "No one shall seize them out of my hand". Then they shall "never perish" -- that, I think, refers to the present time; it is not a question of perishing eternally. They will not be lost -- it refers to the power which keeps them now, they
{179}
will not apostatise, like Judas. As the Lord says, "I have *lost* none, but the son of perdition".
Ques. Is "saved in the power of his life" a similar thought?
F.E.R. Yes. It is like what the Lord says, "Those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost". You see, there is always a power working here to lead people away. "The wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep". It is the hand of Christ which holds His own. There will be no question of perishing in heaven.
Rem. The course of the Christian is continually beset with dangers, and assaults are made upon him.
F.E.R. Yes. Even after the brazen serpent there is an attempt to destroy the children of Israel by the Midianites. Balaam comes in, and his counsel is to destroy the people by worldly associations. And it is so, too, in regard to us. After being brought into consciousness of eternal blessing, as in chapter 3, you may still be snared by associations; people get entangled by their associations. I think the great point is, if you have reached the platform, that you should be maintained in it.
Ques. I suppose "following" here would necessitate the acceptance of death?
F.E.R. Well, if you are going to reach Christ, you must reach Him where He now is: the platform of resurrection. From the very fact of its being a platform of resurrection, I must be free from all that is not of that order -- morally free. "In that he liveth, he liveth unto God", and if I am going to reach Him, I must reach Him in moral freedom from all that is unsuited to His own position.
Rem. And there, I suppose, you would find the pasture.
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. What does the pasture refer to?
F.E.R. Well, I think this chapter takes you over
{180}
Jordan. The flock is over Jordan. If you follow Him, it must be over Jordan.
Ques. And you would say that every provision is made for us, like the armour in Ephesians, though that is often said to be for a heavenly man?
F.E.R. Well, no one puts it on but a heavenly man; it is a man who has been in to God that takes up the armour, because I do not think any other man would apprehend what there is to fight against.
Ques. Would you say that these two things go together: "My sheep hear my voice ... and they follow me", and "I give unto them eternal life"?
F.E.R. Yes. I think that is the case. You follow Him to the sphere of eternal life. It does not lead you to heaven, but it brings you to Gilgal, and there you are kept by the power of Christ.
Ques. You are still actually here, but in spirit there?
F.E.R. Yes. Like Colossians -- there were plenty of dangers, traditions, and so on, there, things which would tend to interest the mind: "philosophy and vain deceit ... after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ". People have got to be a bit careful as to the food of their minds. They are uncommonly careful as to the food of their bodies, but they do not think much about what is suitable for their minds.
Ques. What about literature?
F.E.R. Well, it all depends on the object for which you read it. But what tries me is that I do not see the "wisdom of God" absorbing the attention of the young people today. They read Scripture, and they go to meetings, and they are orderly, and so on, but they have not come to the wisdom whose "ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace".
Ques. That is Christ, is it not?
F.E.R. Well, it is. You see it is all put abstractly in the Proverbs. There is enough in the wisdom of God to absorb the greatest man, so that you would
{181}
not want philosophy, vain deceit, and the like. You get it in @Colossians 2: "the full knowledge of the mystery of God; in which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge".
Rem. If we saw what was "in man", we should not be taken up with these things.
Rem. What we apprehend "in God" would be likely to attract us, rather than what is "in man".
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. If you get an idea of the scope of God's ways, and the wisdom declared in the working out of those ways, you soon turn away from man's ways, and his wisdom, which has never really attained form or shape; it has been all theory, without any real development.
Rem. It is all an attempt to build up a basis, but nothing ever stands the searching light of divine wisdom.
F.E.R. Quite so. On every hand you see the wisdom of God coming in, baffling every combination of man and the enemy, and giving the form of His own purpose to everything. That is what you see on the part of God all through.
Rem. And you really get the Father and the Son here on one line with one purpose.
F.E.R. The resurrection -- Christ and the flock -- is wonderful. Christ has given His life, but what comes to pass is that there is the revival of Christ and the flock. They are risen together with Him; they cannot perish, they are revived with Him. That is where I see divine wisdom. God is not baffled by all the working of man, but Christ is revived in the very scene where He was put to death.
Rem. And He is the wisdom and power of God.
F.E.R. Exactly. The revival of Christ is for testimony, but there is also what I might call the worship side of it, the "Aaron and his sons" side. Worship and testimony go together.
{182}
Rem. The worship side is what He presented to the woman in chapter 4.
F.E.R. Yes, you must have that side. I think the worship side is the higher of the two. Take the calling in @Ephesians 1: "He hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love" -- it is "through Jesus Christ to *himself*". God must have the first part, and then there is the side of God's testimony.
Ques. Would you say the worship is more for the inner circle, and the testimony for what is. outside?
F.E.R. Yes, quite so, as to its aspect. Until the time comes for the display of Christ in glory, God maintains a testimony here. The flock is the testimony. The whole thing is most beautiful. You see, when Christ was here He was in humiliation, but now we have Christ at the right hand of God, and morally revived in the saints down here. That is a much greater thing, in a certain sense. When He was here it was all limited to one Person, there was but *one* "corn of wheat". Now in chapter 14 things are to be fully commensurate to His place in glory. He was solitary down here, but now He is at the highest place of honour and glory, and you have what is commensurate down here in the power of the Holy Spirit. All that which came out morally in Christ down here comes out now in the church, and then the church is in the light of His glory, though down here it shares in His rejection.
Rem. "Whom he justified, them he also glorified". You could not have had that before.
F.E.R. No, quite so. The Spirit is the Spirit of glory. Really all that is of God in the saints is from heaven, and therefore when you get to the church, you find it properly on the resurrection platform, in complete deliverance from all that is contrary to God.
Rem. And even though that is not to be seen by
{183}
the outward eyes, you would seek to bring people back to the first thought of God as to the church.
F.E.R. Yes, I would not care to bring people to anything else than the thought of God. I would not put up with anything inferior to that.
Ques. God could not, could He?
F.E.R. I do not think so; inasmuch as there is no past or *future* with the Spirit of God, but only *present* -- the Spirit of God is unchanging, and the thought of God unchanging.
Rem. Really the whole of the gospel of John is on that line -- time does not come into it.
F.E.R. No. He rather puts things upon the ground of what always abides. Everything in the gospel is outside of man, of dispensations. Nothing of *man* is recognised at all. He knew what was in man, and He would not recognise it. "My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all" -- that is what the Lord took account of. We never knew the Father except by the Son, that is, until we found ourselves in the hand of the Son. "No one comes to the Father unless by me". Here you get the wonderful statement, "I and my Father are one". You must take into account the *Person*, and lose all idea of *condition*, and all that.
Ques. You mean by "condition" His manhood?
F.E.R. Well, you can only take account of the *Person*, and I am more than ever persuaded that people who try to distinguish between His divinity and manhood will find themselves in inextricable difficulties. He was the Son from all eternity. You can designate Him by titles, and so on, but you have always to keep *the Son* before you. That would solve many difficulties.
Rem. The titles only get their value from Him.
F.E.R. Quite so. What you get here is really a most astounding statement: "I am my Father are one". What I should understand by that is that they
{184}
were perfectly one in purpose and counsel. No one could have made that statement unless He had been the Son.
Rem. The measure of the Father is the measure of the Son all through John; and yet in what comes out afterwards, He speaks of Himself as a Man.
F.E.R. Yes. I think He always speaks to them from His position as Man. He takes them up in that way, and shows them their inconsistency: "Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?" You see, He was sanctified and sent into the world, and He was not inconsistent with it. It might be said of an apostle that he was sanctified and sent into the world, but then he might be inconsistent with it, but with the Lord the statement was fully justified. Their only reply was to accuse Him of blasphemy: "Thou, being a man, makest thyself God", but He shows them that to those to whom the word of God came, it was such a dignity, that it could be said of them, "Ye are gods". If that could be said of those to whom He refers, what title too wonderful and honourable for Himself!
Rem. And they could not be said to have done the works of God, as the Lord did.
F.E.R. No. He, coming into the world, did the works of God, and He bases His title to be considered the Son of God on that fact, which was before the eyes of all men. He was properly attested and proved. The works of His Father -- the miracles -- were there before Him, and within their comprehension, so that they were without excuse.
Rem. And therefore their rejection was wilful.
F.E.R. Yes, because they were works which appealed to them, and of which man's mind could take cognisance.
I think, you know, the Lord made them understand that He put Himself on another platform in distinction from them, and they did not like it. A prophet never
{185}
took that ground, he was one of themselves; but, especially in this gospel, the Lord occupies another platform altogether; in spite of His being of man, the son of Joseph, as was reckoned, or Mary, yet He takes another platform. As He says, "Ye are from beneath, I am from above". They disliked that. The same things would come out in regard to the church if they knew their proper place, which is *from above* -- that is its proper place. That is the great point in Ephesians -- you have been *in* to God, and then you come out from God. That is the proper place and testimony of the church down here, Jew and Gentile "builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit".
It is not merely that He was Son of God, for He was that as man, as in @Psalm 2, but it is the greatest statement He could make: "I am in the Father, and the Father in me". He took that ground, and did the works, and they were witness to the truth, they attested it. It was not that He was doing things exactly as God, but in the way of testimony, and they proved the truth of what He said.
Ques. Would you say, "in the bond of the Spirit"?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. The gospel of John was bringing out what had never been revealed before -- the truth of GOD. In the Old Testament they had no idea of the Father and the Son, but in this gospel that is the wonderful revelation which comes out. It is no longer the question of the unity of the Godhead, which, of course, remained true, but now what we have is the truth of divine Persons, and that is now, for the first time, unfolded. It never could have come out until the Son came forth.
Ques. Is there not a hidden allusion to it in the words, "What is his son's name"?
F.E.R. Well, that may be; but the general statement, running through all Old Testament scriptures, is that God is one.
{186}
CHAPTER 11
F.E.R. There are two great things, two great points, in this chapter, I think: one is the Son of God; the other, the plotting of man, the counsel of man. The glory of God comes out in the raising of Lazarus, but then on the other hand you get the plotting of man really against the glory of God.
Rem. Though even here you see how entirely hopeless their plotting was; it only worked out what God intended.
F.E.R. Quite so.
Rem. The plotting of man is rather late when resurrection had come in.
F.E.R. Yes. But you see that they would put the Lord to death and even Lazarus too, if they could. The real plotting of man, if we could only see the end of it, is against the glory of God. You see it in @Psalm 2: "The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed". It is the plotting of man against the glory of God; it really took place in connection with Christ in glory (see @Acts 4).
Ques. And therefore it comes out after the resurrection?
F.E.R. Yes, after the resurrection. It must be either one thing or the other; you must really have fellowship with the glory of God, or with the counsel of man.
Rem. But what you see is that men are between the two, swayed one way or the other.
F.E.R. Yes. I have felt much lately that men will never understand what is for man unless they understand what is for God; they have very little understanding of what is for man, because they have so little understanding of what is for God.
Rem. God must be first because He is God.
{187}
F.E.R. Yes. He first prepares for Himself, and every man must learn what God has prepared for Himself, that is the great thing to be learnt.
Ques. You mean after he is converted?
F.E.R. Well, he has no taste for it before he is a Christian; but then, if he understands what is for God, he will then have come to the consciousness of what is for man; instead of believing it simply, he will have the consciousness of it. It is one thing to believe a thing, but it is another thing to have the consciousness of it.
Rem. I suppose the great point in the gospel is that God has been glorified.
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. It was not simply that man's need has been met. What took place in the raising of Lazarus was "for the glory of God", it was really God setting forth His glory.
Ques. Do you think the incident in chapter 11 is in a kind of way a proof of what He is able to give in eternal life?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. It connects itself with Him as Son of God. When you come to chapter 12 you get other things coming out, titles which are more for man, but the great point in chapter 11 is the testimony to Him as Son of God. He secures what is for the glory of God.
Ques. In resurrection?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
Rem. And therefore man is wholly done for, he has lain four days already in the tomb.
F.E.R. Yes; I think the Lord allowed that to come in, in a way.
Rem. Man's dishonour and God's glory meet at that point.
F.E.R. Yes. I think that many instinctively feel that, in the presence of God, man is nothing.
Rem. And a very good thing too, if it is accepted.
{188}
F.E.R. Yes; you see, the principle of God's glory is resurrection.
Ques. Would you say that the glory of God is what God can do from His own side?
F.E.R. Yes. The glory of God is what displays Himself, and resurrection is the principle of it all. I do not know what better word to use -- though the word is not liked sometimes -- than platform, the resurrection-platform; it is life out of death. That is what resurrection means, life and liberty in that sense, and resurrection is the platform.
Rem. Resurrection is the platform where God can have man for His own pleasure, according to Himself.
Rem. Yes, that is it exactly. God can have man according to Himself.
Ques. You would say glory is a further thing than light?
F.E.R. Oh, I think so. Light is where we began to know God, it is what God is morally, but His glory is that which connects itself more with His pleasure, it is all that in which He is glorified. It is really impossible to define it -- glory is distinction. The glory of a person is his own proper distinction. God's glory is His distinction, and our glory is our distinction. As it says in @Romans 8, "The creature itself also shall be set free from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God".
Rem. And like @1 Corinthians 2, "which God ordained before the world unto our glory".
F.E.R. Yes. Glory is peculiar and particular. Our blessing is really in the glory of God, that is, the blessing of the church, the church becomes the vessel of His glory.
Ques. And would not @1 Corinthians 15 be the same thing, "One glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon", etc.?
F.E.R. Yes. The glory of the one is not the glory of the other. The sun shines by its own light, but
{189}
the glory of the moon is its reflected light; each has its peculiar distinction. I think that God's glory is the satisfaction of His nature in the accomplishment of His purposes, in that His nature is satisfied.
Rem. And that is illustrated in the resurrection of Lazarus.
F.E.R. Quite so. Resurrection is the great principle of it -- the principle or platform on which God brings it to pass. Now if you take the first four things that come out in that epitome in @Hebrews 12, I think that is where the glory of God comes in: "But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven". That is all for God, it presents what is for God, what God has secured for Himself; that is His glory. But then you come to another list of things which are for man: "To God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than Abel". They are for man, but you will not understand what is for man if you do not understand what is for God.
Ques. Does it not come out in @Luke 10 where the Lord tells them rather to rejoice "that your names are written in heaven" -- there was something for God?
F.E.R. Quite so. Take mount Zion, God has turned everything to His own glory, for the display of Himself. You see, mount Zion really represented that the ark, which had been taken captive, was brought back again to mount Zion; now the true ark of the covenant to the Jew was Christ, but then they had lost Him, and that by their own perverseness; but God had raised Christ from the dead, and had exalted Him "to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins". You have Christ there at the right hand of God, in a
{190}
position in which He can give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.
Rem. It is abundance of grace.
F.E.R. Yes. God comes out according to all the greatness of Himself, and to accomplish His own pleasure.
Rem. And if God did not act in His sovereignty, man would have nothing.
F.E.R. No. God takes occasion of what sin had brought in -- death -- to display Himself in the power of resurrection.
Rem. And that is the outcome of man's plotting together.
F.E.R. Yes; and then everything that is raised from the dead is for God.
Ques. What relation would you say the Holy Spirit has to the new platform of resurrection?
F.E.R. Well, it is the power by which God enables us to reach that platform; the Holy Spirit has come here to enable us to reach what God has reached; God has reached the ground of resurrection, and the Holy Spirit has come to enable us too to reach that ground. It is in our state. The Holy Spirit has come to give us complete deliverance from sin and the flesh, and to quicken us in the life of Christ.
Ques. Just as Lazarus is brought into the company of Christ?
F.E.R. Yes. He has a peculiar place after this, he is in association with Christ, and that is the position of all now. What brings us into our present place with Christ is being risen with Him. Deliverance brings you into the present place now. You are not qualified for your priestly position except as risen with Christ.
Ques. And you must go through the experience of death?
F.E.R. Yes.
{191}
Ques. Would the washing the hands and feet at the layer be the symbol of it?
F.E.R. Well, I should think that would be more practical suitability for it, in a scene where the hands and feet are likely to be defiled. Every miracle is selected in John. It is not a mere record of the miracles He did, but they are selected specially.
Ques. And for what object?
F.E.R. I think the object is to hang the teaching upon them. There are miracles of Christ recorded, but I think they are all used upon which to hang something greater.
Rem. So the raising of Lazarus is to show that He is the Son of God.
F.E.R. Yes; and so in chapters 6 and 9, too, you get teaching resulting from the miracle. In chapter 6 He makes the feeding of the multitude the means of presenting Himself as the Living Bread come down from heaven.
Ques. Were the signs the introduction of Christ to the new company?
F.E.R. Well, I think the signs really set forth Christ as presented to Israel, as, for example, the man at the pool of Bethesda. But I think they are used for the introduction of something much greater.
Ques. And He will have to come to Israel as He came to Lazarus?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
Rem. He "does many signs" (verse 47).
F.E.R. Yes, and they were really to them the sign that He was what He avowed Himself to be. You see, a sign is a sign. A sign has reference to something which is signified, it is not the thing signified, but the sign of that thing. What is signified lies behind the sign.
Ques. Are there not three very distinct signs in the resurrection of Lazarus, the entry into Jerusalem, and then the Greeks coming up to see Jesus?
{192}
F.E.R. Well, I do not know whether you would call them signs exactly, with the exception of the raising of Lazarus. What I see is this, you must have the Son of God before you can have the Son of man or the Son of David; in the moral order of things you must have the Son of God first.
Rem. Resurrection must be brought in.
F.E.R. Yes; you must have what is for God before you can have what is for man. "Son of God" refers to the glory of God; "Son of man" and "King of Israel" are the titles which comprise everything for man. "Son of man" means the subjugation of every enemy of man, and "Son of David" means that He has the "sure mercies of David".
Ques. And even these two are in resurrection?
F.E.R. Yes, everything is on the ground of resurrection.
Ques. Is there not something for God in the title of Son of man?
F.E.R. Yes, but then I think that what that really means is the introduction of blessing for man, the putting down of every enemy of man, that is, to bring in the world to come. That is the idea of Son of man -- the subjugation of every enemy of man, Satan and every enemy.
Rem. We see it in @Psalm 8: "that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger".
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. The Son of God presents, if I might use the expression, His link with God; but Son of man and Son of David present His link with man, that is certain. Now on the resurrection platform He is on the one hand the expression of God Himself, but on the other, you see His link with man. It is very evident that His title of Son of David refers to His link with man. It says, "I am the root and the offspring of David" -- not 'I was', but "I *am*".
Rem. "Thou madest him a little lower than the angels ... for the suffering of death".
{193}
F.E.R. Yes, that is the Son of man, that He might "taste death for everything". It is that side, man's side.
Ques. But is there nothing for God in that a man holds the reins of government for God?
F.E.R. Yes, of course, because God's glory is in all, but I am only speaking of the particular connection of these titles in Scripture. God is glorified in everything, though man is too. If he has dominion, it is for God's glory, but, for all that, it is man's side. As far as that goes, God is glorified in the fact of a man having forgiveness of sins, but it is not for God; neither is the subjugation of every enemy of man for God, but really for man.
Ques. Would you say in what connection the "innumerable company of angels" comes in on God's side in @Hebrews 12?
F.E.R. Well, they are His ministers in everything. Everything is cleared out of the way by them. He sends forth His angels and they clear out of His kingdom all that defile, and cast them into the lake of fire.
Ques. "Bind them in bundles to burn them" -- is it the angels who do that?
F.E.R. Yes; that is, out of His kingdom.
Ques. What does it mean, "They are equal to angels, and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection"?
F.E.R. They are like the angels in some particulars of their being. It is a heavenly order of being, not an earthly one -- "they are equal to angels". In one sense, too, the angels are guardians providentially.
Ques. The guardians of the heavenly city?
F.E.R. Yes; but, mark you, the heavenly city is for God, though man gets the good of it.
Ques. Would you gather that from its coming down "having the glory of God"?
F.E.R. Yes.
Rem. We can see from the chapter before us that
{194}
they had to be led on to this platform in their souls, they were believers already.
F.E.R. Yes, I think the most wonderful thing is to see what God has secured for Himself.
Ques. Do you not get a hint of it in @Exodus 15?
F.E.R. Yes, you do: "Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O Lord, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established". And you get exactly the same thing in @Ephesians 1: "that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself". It is not for our pleasure, but for His. Then eventually you come down to the forgiveness of sins, that is for man; but you enter into consciousness of what is for man, because you are in the full light of what is for God. Thousands and thousands of Christians believe in the forgiveness of sins, but they are not in the consciousness of it, because they do not apprehend what is for God. That accounts for many of the hymns that are sung in the meeting, people are not in the consciousness of having their sins forgiven, and therefore they like to sing about them, so as to give themselves assurance that they are so. They have the faith of it, but they have not the consciousness of it. If they understood what was for God, they would understand what was for man, and then you would not care to talk much about your sins.
Ques. Is not that the principle of @Hebrews 10? You get the will of God first, and then that "He hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified".
F.E.R. I think so. I do not say that you begin at the top when you are first converted, but when God takes you in hand you begin from the top. It is perfectly right in principle to say that you begin from the top. The fact is this, if there were not something for God, there would not be anything for man. You see,
{195}
Christ has been presented to man's responsibility and He has been rejected of man, and therefore if now there were nothing for God, there could be nothing for man.
Rem. And no doubt you have noticed that people who are always on man's side never get established.
F.E.R. No; I am very glad it does not need consciousness to save a person; it is faith that does that, but it is required for Christianity.
Rem. As you see in @1 John 5, "that ye may know that ye have eternal life", who "believe on the name of the Son of God".
F.E.R. Yes; that is the consciousness of it.
Ques. But does it not often, in the way it is put, begin with man's need?
F.E.R. Well, I do not know, I was only speaking of it in connection with the chapter, because this is a most striking chapter. It brings in the glory of God in the Son of God: "that the Son of God might be glorified thereby".
Ques. What does that mean, "that the Son of God might be glorified thereby"?
F.E.R. I think it gives Him the distinction of being the One who really brings into effect all the pleasure of God, that is, the glory of the Son of God, God is glorified in Him. He brings into effect that which-is for the pleasure of God.
Rem. It brings Him into prominence, too.
F.E.R. Yes. You get the thought in chapter 17: "as thou hast given him power over all flesh". That is His place, His distinction.
Ques. Then "glorified" here is connected with resurrection?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. He was glorified by the resurrection of Lazarus, but what the resurrection of Lazarus means in type and shadow is that the Son of God brings in all God's pleasure. You get in @Hebrews 1, where He is looked at as Son of God, what God has
{196}
secured for Himself. Then chapter 2 gives you what is secured for man. You get distinctly the two sides there.
Ques. In what sense would you say making purgation for sins was for God?
F.E.R. That was really needed to clear away all the difficulty. But then in the whole of the chapter afterwards you find out what is secured for God. It goes on to say, "being made so much better than the angels", etc.; then you get all the detail of the name and the throne; it is really what God has secured for Himself that is presented. Nobody but the Son of God could have interfered in this scene as He did.
Rem. None but He could call the dead from their graves.
F.E.R. No. None but the Son of God could bring in life out of death. How was God coming into death? But that is the secret of grace, the manner of grace. God Himself came into death where man was; how was that to be done but by the Son of God? God comes where man was in the place of death, and He comes in the Person of the Son.
Ques. The Son become man?
F.E.R. Yes. But then He comes into it in all the value of what He was, and He could not be holden of it. Resurrection must come in as a moral necessity. God comes into man's judgment in divine goodness and grace, and brings into it all the moral excellence of what He is, and then resurrection comes in as a moral necessity; the excellence outweighs the judgment -- surpasses the judgment.
Rem. So that there is absolute benefit for man out of it.
Rem. He was declared Son of God with power by resurrection from the dead.
F.E.R. Yes. Resurrection glorified Him in that way.
{197}
Rem. It testified to Him as Son of God; it is not exactly a question of *when*.
F.E.R. No; it is the principle of it; the Father was glorified in it, and He too. You see, in the raising of Lazarus I think there was testimony to Him, as to who He was, before all the shame came in. I think one can see the wisdom of God in it, that there should be ample testimony to Christ, and what He was before He passes on to the suffering.
Rem. In one sense it was as you say, He could not be holden of it, but He came there to deliver His friends.
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. He is superior to all. He can break the bands of death, and raise Lazarus.
Rem. Man had come to the lowest ebb if be whom the Lord loved was dead. As to Martha, I think she was simply orthodox, she did not believe on Him as the resurrection and the life. She says, "Thou art the Christ ... which should come into the world". She would have assented to anything that the Lord said to her, I suppose.
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. I think she gave herself credit for more than she really believed.
Rem. Is not that where many of us are, we believe or give our assent to things just because they are the word of God.
Ques. How do you get the faith of it; of course it is individual?
F.E.R. Well, I think we have to travel through a good deal of exercise first.
Rem. Man could not reach the resurrection platform except through death.
F.E.R. No, it involves death. Resurrection has no meaning except it is a taking out of death.
Ques. I suppose the sisters could not have reached it except through the death of their brother?
F.E.R. No. The Lord used the death of their brother to exercise them. It has been often remarked
{198}
that Mary of Bethany was not at the tomb; she anointed the Lord for His burial, and she was in the faith of His resurrection, that is certain. You find a very different tone about Martha.
Rem. It does not say of Martha that she wept.
F.E.R. No, it does not. The Lord wept, and Mary wept. Then it is very remarkable what Martha says to Mary, "The Master is come, and calleth for thee"; she recognised, I think, if you can understand the expression, that she could scarcely sustain the intercourse. She felt that Mary understood Him better. I think it is a great test as to how people can bear intercourse with the Lord -- one can test oneself that way.
Ques. As to whether one is resting or restless?
F.E.R. Yes. Whether they are at home with the Lord.
Rem. Does it not come out in our meetings sometimes? If there is a pause, there is a feeling that something must be done.
F.E.R. I was thinking more of people individually, it has to begin there.
Ques. Do you take Lazarus as a figure of the whole company brought into resurrection?
F.E.R. Well, I had not taken it so much in that way; I had looked at it more as the circumstances being a testimony to the Lord; I had not quite entered into the typical idea of Lazarus.
Ques. How did you mean that intercourse with the Lord was a test to us?
F.E.R. Well, I think I can test myself that way, as to the liberty of intercourse one has with the Lord.
Rem. The children of Israel told Moses that he must speak face to face with the Lord, but they would not come near -- it tested them.
F.E.R. Quite so; it tested them.
Ques. Is it through prayer that we have intercourse?
F.E.R. In a certain sense prayer is different from
{199}
intercourse. All pious people pray, and there are circumstances which will cast us upon God; but intercourse is to me more exchange of mind with the Lord in regard to His interests.
Rem. The intimacy of friendship.
F.E.R. Yes, certainly. In fact, it is one feature of the gospel of John that you get very little of prayer on the Lord's side. It is just the very opposite in the gospel of Luke, where you so often find the Lord in prayer. Paul prayed before he had the Holy Spirit, "Behold, he prayeth".
Rem. What you were saying would just agree with the character of the two gospels.
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. A wonderful thing strikes one in this chapter: the tenderness and sympathy of the Lord. They come out very remarkably on the part of One who could exercise the power of resurrection.
Rem. He waited deliberately for the glory of God, though He felt for them in all their sorrow.
F.E.R. Yes. In the Lord you see perfect power for all the sorrow and infirmity of man. There are many things which distress me down here, the poverty and the misery that meet one in everyday life; I can truly say these things distress me, they make me sick at heart sometimes; but then I cannot touch them, it is impossible for me to touch them, no power on earth can meet them. But with the Lord the case was entirely different. On His part He had power to meet everything, but what you get coming out here so beautifully is the wonderful tenderness and sympathy of the Lord. You see, if the Lord simply exercised His *power* in regard to us, it would not form any link between us; it is the tenderness and sympathy of Christ that link us to Him. He really forms the link before He exercises His power; we get the exercise of all His priestly offices before we get His power put forth as Saviour. He establishes a moral link first,
{200}
and that is what you get coming out in principle here. Before ever He raises Lazarus, He forms a moral link with Martha and Mary.
Rem. "In all their affliction he was afflicted".
F.E.R. Yes, exactly.
Rem. The exercise of His power would not give us the knowledge of His heart.
F.E.R. No. You see, Aaron not only bore the names of the children of Israel on his shoulders but on his heart; so when the moral link, the spiritual link, is formed, then He goes on to the exercise of His power. In the first creation you see the exercise of power, but there is no moral link in "He commanded, and it stood fast".
Ques. Did you say we knew Him as Priest before we knew Him as Saviour?
F.E.R. Yes, I did. What I meant was that before you get, "He shall change our vile body", you have the moral link with Him. And that is why the Lord delayed to interfere here. It was so important to form this moral link before He exercised His power. It is really formed through priesthood, and that is just the value of the priesthood.
Ques. Is it in verse 26, Every one that is alive and believeth on Me, shall never die for ever?
F.E.R. Yes. "I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live" -- that is the first part.
Ques. When was it "day" for the Lord in contrast with "night"?
F.E.R. Well, there is a time allotted to work, and a night of darkness when no one can work, when a man would stumble.
Ques. What relation has the answer of the Lord in verse 26 to the question of Martha?
F.E.R. I think she is looking at the event rather than the Person. People are always looking at the wrong thing; you see people wanting to understand
{201}
what is going to take place on the earth, but they are looking at the wrong place. If they were to look up to heaven, they would soon get to understand what is to come on the earth. And you see many people looking for the Lord's coming, but they look at the event, not at the Person. The fact is this, we only come into resurrection as we partake of Christ. All that is raised is *Christ*; not a single bit of us will come out of death but what is of Christ.
Rem. Though, of course, it includes the body.
F.E.R. Yes. But I was not thinking of the mere body, you will find Scripture always speaks of the person being raised.
Rem. Yes; except that there are the two classes: those who have died and those who will be alive. "I am the resurrection, and the life" -- a mere man could not say that. What it brings before me is the moral certainty of His coming out of death.
Rem. And therefore His friends, His company, must come with Him.
F.E.R. Yes. If He goes into death, He must come out of it.
Ques. Is it not a correction of what Martha says as to the resurrection at the last day?
F.E.R. Yes. "I am the resurrection, and the life". I am more and more assured in my own mind that everything that comes out of death is for God. Whatever He takes out of death is for Himself. "The ... church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven" is for Himself. The fact is this, the greatness of our blessing just depends on our being for Himself. You would not say that hired servants are exactly for Himself. He has them to serve Him, but what a man has for himself is *sons*. A man does not have affection for his hired servants exactly, those who have the knowledge of his affections are *sons*.
Ques. And we are really sons of God, being "sons of the resurrection"?
{202}
F.E.R. Yes. God claims whatever is of the resurrection for Himself, it is the first-fruits for God in that way.
Rem. The same can be said of the three last parables in @Matthew 13.
F.E.R. Yes. It is the divine side of the kingdom. Man seizes it according to his own mind, he humanises it, but, after all, in the three last parables you get the secret of it all, God is securing something for Himself. The treasure, and the pearl, and the net -- the good fish carried into vessels -- are for Him. I am sure that if we apprehended what God has effected for Himself, we should not lose as to our side at all; we should really come into the consciousness of it.
Ques. If a man "lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God", what then?
F.E.R. Well, he makes himself the object.
I think nothing can be more wonderful than to see that Christ is perfectly unchanged; I feel sure that nothing can be more beautiful than to see the extraordinary tenderness and sympathy of the Lord. It was not for Lazarus that He wept. A man that is dead does not feel the pressure. The widow's son was not the one who felt the pressure, it was the mother, the widow, and it was for her the Lord was touched with compassion. Here it was Martha and Mary who were under the pressure, Lazarus was dead. You see, they have to drink the bitter waters of Marah, but the great point of it is to form spiritual links between Christ and the believer. The Lord wept; He saw the pressure that rested upon man, and the inability of man to meet it, he could not relieve himself from the burden of it. You know, I really feel I could not be too thankful that I was not taken to heaven when I was first converted, for there would have been no moral link between Christ and myself, no knowledge of His heart and affections.
{203}
Rem. The Lord Himself prays, "I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world".
F.E.R. Yes. He left them here for infinitely wise reasons.
Ques. Why does it say that as Priest He is Son of God?
F.E.R. Because He must be the Son to be a Priest; how could you have access to God except as a son? "Jesus, the Son of God"; the two things are carefully connected in Hebrews, the Son and the Priest. We are priests as being sons -- "in bringing many sons to glory".
I think we were noticing in our last reading that there are two main things that come out in this chapter: one the glory of God, and the other the plotting of man.
Ques. Would you gather that Caiaphas spoke really by the influence of the Holy Spirit? that it was not merely the working of his own mind?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. It says, "This spake he not of himself".
Rem. I wondered if its being referred to as a prophecy would imply that it was from God.
F.E.R. Well, I think it is so because of what is added to it. "He prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation; and not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad". He was the high priest for that year, and I think in that sense his prophecy was official. I do not think the man himself was engaged in it any more than Balaam was engaged in his prophecy. Then from that day they plotted and took counsel how they might put Him to death. It was the worst possible thing they could have done; they really used the word of God as an occasion to carry out their own ends.
Rem. Something like what Peter says in the beginning of the Acts, "Him, being delivered by the
{204}
determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain?"
F.E.R. Yes. But here they use the prophecy as an occasion for giving effect to their own wills.
Ques. Do you think that the office of the high priest was recognised of God at this time?
F.E.R. Yes. I think it was recognised until it was publicly set aside.
Rem. Paul recognised it.
F.E.R. Yes. But here you get a prophecy from the mouth of the high priest himself. Nothing could be worse than that the word of God should be taken up as a means of carrying out the will of man, to give effect to man's own will.
Rem. They used the prophecy to cover their own wickedness.
F.E.R. Yes. As long as the system existed I think the Lord recognised it. Speaking in a general way, I do not think that people ever do the right thing to save themselves.
Ques. Not when their own state and trouble is the motive?
F.E.R. No. If you take the history of the children of Israel, for instance, they never really saved themselves out of their difficulties. They schemed and plotted, they turned to this king and that king, and to this nation and that nation, but they really never saved themselves; in fact, they only brought themselves into worse difficulty in the long run.
Rem. You see that at the time of the captivity.
F.E.R. Yes. They tried to set one nation against another, they turned to one and sought to set another against it. It was just a bit of human scheming, but they never really brought about their own deliverance.
Ques. To "gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad" -- it is rather remarkable
{205}
that they should be designated in that way. Who are those thus designated?
F.E.R. Well, I think you have to bear in mind that this gospel was written very late.
Rem. But still, I suppose there are those gathered even in the present time, the children of God.
Ques. Is it not somewhat like chapter 10, "Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring"; in that way recognising the sheep before He "brings" them?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
Rem. I think what you say is very important, that John was written very late.
Ques. Is it like Hebrews a, "Behold, I and the children which God hath given me"? In what sense is it children there?
F.E.R. It is not exactly children of God in the family sense.
Ques. Is it not a term of affection in @Hebrews 2 for His own?
F.E.R. It is quoted from @Isaiah 8. It is the same word as there, it means "little children". I think it is a word John uses; you know it is the same in "Little children, it is the last time", @1 John 2: 18.
Ques. Did it not refer here to the remnant from Israel?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
Ques. But does not this passage in chapter 11 also go far beyond Israel?
F.E.R. Yes, no doubt. "Children of God" here is really those who are begotten of God, it is a word derived from "beget". "Now are we children of God" -- that is what the apostle says in the first epistle, and it is the same word here.
Rem. Apart from the death of Christ the saints could only be individuals.
F.E.R. You could have nothing corporate until the Holy Spirit came. There might be a sort of
{206}
national link, but no real link except in the power of the Holy Spirit. You would have unity in the flesh otherwise; but there could not be any such thing as spiritual unity until the Holy Spirit came. One body is dependent upon one Spirit, it is the one Spirit that forms the unity. You may have unity in the divine nature, but it is really a deeper thing than the unity of the Spirit.
Rem. Please explain that.
F.E.R. Well, you might have unity in the fact of having the Spirit, but unity in the divine nature, "that they all may be one, as we are", is really the *work* of the Spirit, and lies deeper than the other. The fact is this, you may have baptism by the Spirit into one body, but you cannot really make much of it on account of the general state of things. What you want in the present day is unity in the divine nature.
Ques. "Love, which is the bond of perfectness"?
F.E.R. Yes, exactly; you have to come to realities in the present day.
Rem. We might have the Spirit, and yet be very small indeed in the divine nature.
F.E.R. Yes, very small indeed; you cannot touch those things apart from the Holy Spirit. In the death of Christ two things are seen: one, man is gone, he is removed in the death of Christ, but then what comes out also in that death is the formation of a new man. The man under judgment has gone in judgment; but what has come in through the death of Christ is the formative power for a new man. Man is not one single bit in touch with the love of God until he has got the Holy Spirit; but then he is not partaker of the divine nature by the fact of having the Spirit, but when he is formed in it. A man is born of God, I should say, not when he receives the Spirit, but when he knows and responds to the love of God.
Ques. Is not a man born of God when the love of God "is shed abroad" in his heart by the Holy Spirit?
{207}
F.E.R. But he wants to breathe in response to it; you want a breath from the man in response to it.
Rem. God breathed into Adam the breath of life, then he began to breathe.
F.E.R. Yes. I think you get the response in @Romans 8. Chapter 5 is one side, chapter 8 is another. In chapter 8 you get, "All things work together for good to them that *love* God"; that is the way in which we live, it is the spirit or character of the life. "Born of God" is properly a description of a Christian. Christians are born of God; that is, their generation is after God -- like the new man "which after God is created in righteousness and holiness of truth" -- it is after His own nature; it is characteristic in that sense.
Rem. It is "He that loveth is born of God".
F.E.R. Yes; it is whosoever loves; that verse really puts it plainly enough: the one who loves is born of God, and knows God. You see, you cannot know God except by love, you are not in touch with Him, there is nothing akin to Him.
Ques. What about @1 John 5: 1, "Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God"? In chapter 4 it is, "Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God".
F.E.R. I think "Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the-Christ" is looked upon in that way as evidence that he is born of God; it is in order that you may not discredit those whose faith is not equal to the apprehension of Christ as the Son of God. You can recognise those who believe that Jesus is the Christ, and you can love them because they are born of God. We might have seen the necessity for this in the early days, when they were dealing with the Jews. Take the apostles in the early part of the Acts, they had very little apprehension of Jesus as the Son of God. I do not say they did not know it, but it did not come out in their testimony much.
{208}
Rem. That was really a new departure with Paul.
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. Do you not think there are souls in that condition in the present day?
F.E.R. Yes, I do. There is a great deal of difference between orthodox belief and what people really believe. There are many who have not believed as much really as they put in their creed; do you not think so? I think people are very much behind their creed sometimes.
Ques. Was not this used as a test for the Jews of that time, whether they believed Jesus was the Christ?
F.E.R. Yes. It is used in that way as a test for spirits. You see, Christ Himself was anointed with the Holy Spirit, and He anoints with the Holy Spirit. But that is the proof that He *is* Son of God; yet it is as the Christ that He gives the Spirit, it is as the Christ that He gives the living water in chapter 4.
It is very awful to see the fearful perverseness of man after such an expression -- if I might use the word -- of the glory of God in the raising of Lazarus. They set to work to plot how they might get rid of the Lord. It is just the same with men in the present day, they almost plot to get rid of Christianity, yet surely they cannot shut their eyes to the effect that Christianity has had on the world.
Rem. Here it seems the more wilful on account of the prophecy.
F.E.R. Yes. I think it is just evidence of the desperate dislike that men have of God interfering in the world. I think that men will bear what is providential, but the idea of divine interference is very intolerable to man; man cannot tolerate the idea of that.
Rem. They blasphemed the God of heaven in @Revelation 16.
F.E.R. Yes, exactly. They wanted God to keep
{209}
in His own place; I think it is true what is generally said, John claims the world for God.
Rem. I thought that in the Revelation you find them refusing the God of the earth, but then, you see, they give glory to the God of heaven.
F.E.R. Yes. But at the end of the book you get them blaspheming the God of heaven.
Rem. In chapter 11 they refuse His claim to the earth, but they give glory to the God of heaven.
F.E.R. Yes.
Rem. It is a great comfort that, act as man will, God too will do as He will.
F.E.R. Quite so. You cannot gainsay that fact which comes out in this chapter: "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby".
Rem. The Heir had come.
F.E.R. He had. It is remarkable that in Matthew the parable of the husbandmen is followed by the parable of the marriage of the king's son; they say, "Come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance". But when you come to the marriage supper what you find is, "A certain king ... made a marriage for his son". God's purposes stand good in His Son really; and so here, witness has been borne to the glory of the Son of God. What God intends to bring into this world is victory over death; it is His superiority over evil, and that has been witnessed by the Son of God.
Rem. Only man would not have it. They said, "This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance".
F.E.R. You know, I think that if such a thing were possible as that Christ should come into the world and raise the dead, it would be very intolerable to men; they would rather have death than that the Lord should come in and raise the dead. They would like it staved off by means of medicine, perhaps, but
{210}
as an act of divine power it would be very intolerable to man. You see, it would upset everything. They even wanted to put Lazarus to death.
Rem. They would not put up with a risen man who bore witness to the power of the Son of God.
F.E.R. No. What man virtually says is, Leave the earth to us; whatever the woes may be, leave the earth to us. They want nothing more of God than His providence.
Ques. Their own side of things?
F.E.R. Yes. But then there is a vast number of people in the world on whom the providence of God falls very heavily, but they would rather have even that than that God should interfere with them.
Ques. Do you think the spirit of that was seen when they said, "We will not have this man to reign over us"?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. Of course, that was more especially the Jews, they were the husbandmen. You look at the terrific effort that is made to get rid of the Scriptures -- repeated and constant effort to get rid of the validity of the Scriptures; the thing is not let alone, there are constant attacks made upon it, the effort is unceasing. But if Scripture is not the word of God, if it only contains divine ideas, it is not scripture to me. The interference of God down here is intolerable to men, and I am sure the very idea of the truth is also intolerable. It becomes a kind of standard by which everything must be tested. What they say today is that there may be divine ideas in the Scriptures, but they are clothed in fallible and human language. Well, if that be so, it ceases to be scripture to me.
Rem. Man does not believe that death is the judgment of God, and therefore he does not want the glory of God. And they do not care one single bit about God meeting the judgment.
{211}
Rem. People tide over the death of their relatives by visits of condolence, and all that sort of thing.
F.E.R. Yes. You see, they could not possibly look openly at the thing.
Rem. Until people see what it is to be under the judgment of God they cannot appreciate the Son of God.
F.E.R. No. Resurrection is the great expression of His glory. I think it is the complete satisfaction which God has in triumphing over all the power of evil.
Rem. If men understood anything at all about God, they would welcome that which relieves them of the judgment of God.
F.E.R. Yes, that is so. I think the Lord brings out the truth of things in chapter 3. He says they "loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil" -- and they do not come to the light lest their deeds should be detected.
Rem. As you have said, they shrank from exposure.
F.E.R. Yes. It is the great and prominent things that deceive people in this day; it is the great system of the world. You know Nebuchadnezzar said, "Is not this great Babylon, that I have built?" -- that is what the world is. Man with great toil has built up this great Babylon, and it is the devil's instrument to deceive people, the great artificial system. I do not simply refer to this country, but to the whole system; and it is not the work of one generation or two, but a vast system built up, with a very long history, and with much labour. That is what the devil uses to blind people, the great system of the world.
Rem. And it does succeed.
F.E.R. Yes, it does: "Lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them".
The world on the one hand, and Christ on the other -- Christ who is the image of God -- are at the
{212}
very opposite poles, but man is really in bondage to one or the other; that is as certain as possible.
Rem. If a man were to be raised from the dead, the world would not know what to do with him.
F.E.R. No; and I think whatever God raises from the dead He raises for Himself, and I should not find it difficult to prove that it is so from Scripture; He puts His hand, His claim, on everything that is raised from the dead.
Ques. Would you mind giving us a scripture which proves it?
F.E.R. Well, "They are ... sons of God, being sons of the resurrection" -- they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels, and they are the sons of God, being sons of the resurrection. The same thing comes out too in regard to Israel, "I will be for thee and thou shalt be for me"; they are raised again for Jehovah. You see, it says to us, "that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God". I am sure that where the resurrection platform comes in, you will always find that all is for God.
Rem. Even as to Christ it says, "In that he liveth, he liveth unto God".
F.E.R. Yes, "liveth unto God"; and so He always did, but now in resurrection it is that others who are raised from the dead should be with Him, they have God for their object.
Ques. And the firstborn were really taken from death?
F.E.R. Yes. The "church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven" -- that is really an allusion to those who were spared out of Israel. You see, God claimed the firstborn of Israel, but then He took the tribe of Levi in place of the firstborn.
Rem. Resurrection would be an awful thing except as we know it to be a resurrection to life.
{213}
F.E.R. Yes. Resurrection in itself is a fearful idea. You see, in resurrection a man is not free for his own will again, but must be conscious that resurrection means the will of another for him. Resurrection is for God.
Rem. Except that you get the resurrection of the just and the unjust.
F.E.R. Yes. But the real power of God's salvation is resurrection.
Ques. "For all live unto him" would imply resurrection, would it not?
F.E.R. Yes. The Lord quotes it in that way.
Ques. It could not be said of the wicked dead, could it?
F.E.R. No, I think not.
Ques. Not in one sense?
F.E.R. Well, I do not think I should care to apply the word "live" to them. I think it is simply spoken of Isaac and Jacob and those.
Ques. Would you say that "sons of God, being sons of the resurrection" also applies to Isaac and Jacob, though in a more limited sense?
F.E.R. Yes, I should say so. "Sons of God" is really indefinite. You see, the twenty-four elders in the Revelation are all priestly, and if they are priests then they must be sons, and therefore in a sense they are sons of God; but I do not think it alters the special place of the church.
Ques. It is not quite the same thing as sonship?
F.E.R. No. The Old Testament saints were formed on different lines to the church. There is only one formative line for the Christian, and you could not tell me of another.
Ques. The Holy Spirit?
F.E.R. No, *love*. Old Testament saints were formed in a certain way, and what is formed down here has its lasting effect in glory. You see their aspirations coming out. Look at Abraham: he
{214}
sought a city and desired a country. They embraced the promises; there was a certain moral effect that the promises had upon them. But we are not formed by promises. There is only one thing on which Christians are formed, and that is the revelation of the love of God in Christ. But really that includes and covers everything else; it brings in the whole compass and extent of the divine glory, "the breadth, and length, and depth, and height". It far surpasses everything, the greater includes the less. I imagine such a company (and, alas, that one has to!), a company really formed in divine love; what a company it would be! That is the thing in @1 Corinthians 13; it shows you not only your fitness for the assembly, but for the place that you are going to occupy in heaven.
Rem. I suppose moral glory will come out especially in the church.
F.E.R. Yes, quite so; that they may "be with me where I am". How could you be with Christ where He is if you were not according to Him! it would not be possible.
Rem. It is love that fits them for that: "that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them".
F.E.R. Yes, "and I in them". The course of the Lord is really very remarkable. He walked no more openly among the Jews, and Judaism goes on just as usual: the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.
Ques. And they were the people who really sought Jesus?
F.E.R. Yes. They could not let Him alone, in a sense. Man goes on, these men went on with their passover and their purification, and all that kind of thing.
Ques. Is it not remarkable that religion and wickedness can go on together?
F.E.R. Yes. Religiousness is no kind of check on downright wickedness; there are all kinds of wickedness covered up in a congregation if you could realise it.
{215}
Rem. But on the other hand, the passover of God was about to come.
F.E.R. Yes, it was the substance. I think, too, man's puerilities, if I might use the word, were all very well previous to that, but not afterwards. I think even before God's passover came there must have been many a man who did not act on the letter exactly, but I think he would get into the spirit of the things, he would be right and true in spirit. I very much prefer a man who is right and true in spirit to a man who is so punctilious as to the letter; I think it really wants faith to break through the letter sometimes.
Rem. I think J.N.D. used to say, if only they had recognised that the Lord was in their midst, priests and people would all have been at His feet.
F.E.R. Yes.
Rem. It is striking the way it comes out in John: they were really plotting against the Lord, seeking His life, while outwardly keeping the passover.
F.E.R. Yes. Plotting against the Christ was quite consistent with external righteousness, and so it is today. I think the great thing is to abide by the testimony of the glory of God: "the glad tidings of the glory of the blessed God". The love of God remains; the man who was under judgment has gone in judgment, and the love of God remains.
Rem. It superabounds.
CHAPTER 12
F.E.R. In chapter 12 you get the second great testimony to Him as Son of David.
Ques. Mary anointed the Lord for His burial, did she not?
F.E.R. Yes. The Lord must die as of that line. He could only have His glory as Son of David in resurrection. And so, too, as Son of man. It is most
{216}
essential to see that these chapters contemplate everything on the ground of resurrection.
Rem. This quotation from the prophet is really a testimony to resurrection.
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. What does the perfume of the ointment set forth?
F.E.R. It was what was grateful to the Lord -- it filled all the house. Mary was in a way representative; she comes in in a sort of remnant character, ministering what was grateful to the Lord.
Rem. And yet in view of His death.
F.E.R. Yes. She must have had a measure of sense of this, that He was superior to death. He could not be holden of it; if He went into death, it must be that He should come out of it.
Rem. She would have learnt that at the grave of her brother.
F.E.R. Yes. I think any really pious person must have felt that there was nothing in common between Christ and the will of man. The day we live in is a day of very small things, but there is that down here which is grateful to the Lord; I think there is that, and that is what I want to be in touch with. I am convinced that "right ground" and "right standing", and all that, is not grateful to the Lord.
Lazarus was one of those who sat at table with Him -- you see Lazarus in association with Him. I think it shows us a little that resurrection is really the new platform. I have been very much interested lately in a remark of J.B.S., that we are as much risen with Christ by the grace of God as that we are saved. I mean the fact of our being risen with Christ is as much of God's grace as our justification.
Ques. You mean that if you speak of the grace of God, it includes that?
F.E.R. Yes, it is not apprehended, perhaps. The resurrection of Christ was an *act* of God, but justification
{217}
is His *mind*; not an *act* so much -- it is the bearing of His mind. The thought of God for us is justification. His act was in raising Christ from the dead; but now His mind goes further than justification, it goes on to raising you with Christ; and it is really a question of faith, of entering into His mind. You see it is, "if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification" -- that is, justification is based on the resurrection of Christ. Then when you come to Colossians you find "risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead", and if it is of faith, it is of grace. It is as much of grace that you are risen with Christ as that you are justified. It is just as much His mind that you should be risen together with Christ, as that you should be justified; then, if you enter into it, you have got it. You are justified by entering into His mind, and so, too, you are risen with Him when you enter into His mind, it is His grace to you.
As far as fact goes, the *fact* is *Christ* is risen. You are not justified until you believe, and so, too, you are risen "through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead" -- it is the character of it, not just the mere fact of His resurrection.
Rem. That thought is really brought out in @Ephesians 1.
F.E.R. Yes. "Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead" -- but there you get the exercise of God's power towards us. He has quickened us -- that is *power*, and it is according to that power that He works in us. Justification and "risen with Christ" are the mind of God for us, but quickening is the act of His power; deliverance comes in in connection with quickening. I see this much, that the moment you come to quickening you have got the exercise of God's power. He has forgiven you all trespasses,
{218}
spoilt principalities and powers, and you have *faith* in the operation of God; but deliverance comes in in connection with quickening.
Ques. What does "risen with Christ" mean then?
F.E.R. It is the mind of God that you should be with Christ over Jordan, on heavenly ground.
Rem. You used to say that they were concurrent.
F.E.R. So they are, but deliverance is connected, I am sure now, with being quickened into the divine nature. A man is not quickened except as formed in the divine nature. Putting off the old man is concurrent with putting on the new. This latter has been a help to me. I had always puzzled over that sentence of the apostle and wondered what he could mean, but I think I begin to see it now.
The motive of these Jews does not seem to have been a very exalted one -- they were just wonder-seeking, I should say. "They came not for Jesus sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead". I think that one sees today, too, how very much moral levity there is with people, and entire want of any fixity of purpose; it is much the same now as then. You find people pursuing this thing and that thing, running first after this thing, then after that, but you do not find them pursuing light or truth or anything of that kind. Here you find they give the Lord a kind of ovation when they know that He is coming to Jerusalem, they "took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord".
Rem. It seems that they were more Galileans, according to the record given in the other gospels.
F.E.R. Well, a great many of His miracles were done in Galilee, and we read, too, that they came up to the feast.
Ques. What feast is this?
F.E.R. It is the passover, is it not? I think you
{219}
get three passovers in John. At the beginning of the gospel "the passover of the Jews was near", then in chapter 6 and here also, you get mention of a passover. And this was the one at which He suffered. The death of Lazarus was in connection with the first testimony, as we saw in chapter 11 -- the testimony to Him as Son of God; then Christ's entry into Jerusalem is the occasion of the second -- King of Israel -- One coming in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel. That is the prominent thought of it. It is a most remarkable circumstance that when it is a question of dignity, or exaltation, witness has first to be borne to it in humiliation; you do not inherit exaltation, according to God, until witness has been borne to it, until it has first been testified to. I was speaking of it last night in connection with Joseph -- Joseph had to bear witness to his exaltation before he got it.
Ques. And it took a long time before he reached it?
F.E.R. Yes, a long time. It is a principle with God, I am sure. You see it, too, in regard to the Lord, and you get the very same thing in regard to the church. That is, to my mind, the force of the conflict in @Ephesians 6. You see there the church standing for the sovereign will of God, and it brings it into conflict with the powers of evil; that is my conviction, the will of man sets itself against the sovereign will of God. You see the same principle in the promise to the overcomer in Philadelphia. He is to be conspicuous in the light, "Him ... will I make a pillar in the temple of my God"; but it must be first in testimony, so that he might be accounted worthy of the kingdom. You suffer for it in testimony, and then you get it in glory. "If we suffer, we shall also reign".
Ques. "And having done all, to stand"?
F.E.R. Yes. You stand in the evil day; and you are standing, too, for what is your own according to the sovereign will of God.
Ques. Do you think there is any significance in
{220}
this incident taking place after the Supper -- I mean, is it a figure of resurrection ground, so to speak?
F.E.R. Well, it is striking that Lazarus, whom He had raised, was one of those who sat at supper with Him. But I had looked at the supper more as a Jewish figure. What do you say?
Rem. I had thought so. How could they think that Christ could abide for ever, as it says, save in resurrection?
F.E.R. Quite so. And there is no way to eternal blessing save through His own death. But to refer to the point I was speaking of a moment ago, I am perfectly certain in my own mind that no one can be established here, or effective in conflict, if they are not established in the sovereign will of God -- God's sovereign purpose. God *will* establish what pleases Him -- I am more and more convinced of it.
Rem. You can have no solid ground else.
F.E.R. No, not a bit; God will effect the purpose of His will -- He will be *sovereign*.
Rem. And really that is the only comfort that we have got, poor fickle things that we are.
F.E.R. Quite so. Then the result of that is, you have to accept the place that God has given you in the sovereignty of His will. I do not think the church ought to have been ashamed to stand to its place, but they left "their first love" -- they did not stand to it.
Ques. What is their place?
F.E.R. Heavenly places -- He has "raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ".
Rem. The Jews gave up the kingdom, that was their portion, and turned to the king of the earth.
F.E.R. Yes. I think that what we have to be so thankful for is that God has, in some little measure, opened our eyes to it, that we should not be content with things as they are.
Ques. How would being established in the sovereignty
{221}
of the will of God affect us in the preaching of the gospel?
F.E.R. It does not touch it, the light of God comes into the world for all, and you present in the gospel in that sense the light of God. You have got this much which your Calvinist has not, that there is nothing in the mind of God against the salvation of any one.
Rem. I ventured to remark the other day to someone, that there was nothing in the counsel of God about any one being lost.
F.E.R. No. God's counsel has all to do with blessing, it is God's sovereign purpose of blessing, blessing in which He will be sovereign.
Rem. He "will have all men to be saved". That is the light of God, and there is nothing in the heart of God against the salvation of any one. Of course it is true, on the other hand, that God will compel the salvation of those who are in the purpose of His will, and there would not be much security for you and for me if He did not.
F.E.R. I think you get it in the parable in @Luke 15. The woman brings the light into the *house*, but it is to bring to light the lost piece of silver. The whole house is lighted with the candle. "Light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil". They would not come to the light.
Rem. But it leaves them without excuse.
F.E.R. Yes, without excuse. They did not come to the light lest their deeds should be reproved. I do not believe in any goodness in man, that is all moonshine. Experience would teach one that.
Rem. We find it often enough in our own hearts.
F.E.R. Yes, indeed.
Ques. The purpose of God is not in regard to the first man at all?
F.E.R. No, not at all, but with the second Man;
{222}
you have no vantage ground down here unless you take that ground, and are prepared too, to stand on it and to aver that ground too. The enemy hates the idea of the sovereign will of God. You preach about the capabilities of man, and you will not have much conflict.
Rem. God will work according to His own good pleasure.
F.E.R. Yes. He "works all things according to the counsel of his own will" -- that is the statement. Man wants to be as great as God, and to dictate to God what He shall do, but God does not take counsel with man.
Rem. And man would advise Him very badly if he did.
F.E.R. God will not allow the first man any place. David wanted to build a house for God, but you see it was not the first man that built the house, it was David's son who was to build it; so blessing does not come in by man but by the Son of man.
Ques. How far do you think the believing in Jesus in verse 11 carried these Jews?
F.E.R. Well, they came not for His sake alone, but that they might see Lazarus also. I should not trust it much. You get the same kind of thing more than once in John, believing in Jesus when they saw the miracles that He did, it was simply a mental conviction. Nothing is trusted in John's gospel but what originated in God -- nothing of man is trusted, that is a principle that underlies all John -- God must originate everything, and nothing otherwise is trusted.
Rem. And when they saw Jesus deliver Himself up to be crucified, they were just as easily convinced the other way.
F.E.R. Yes. Well, until resurrection Christ took the place of weakness. He did not vindicate Himself. He did not do anything to deliver Himself, but in resurrection He is "declared to be the Son of God
{223}
with power". As long as He was after the flesh, He took the place of weakness. "He was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God". Here what you see is one coming in the name of the Lord; it is not the King of Israel coming in His own name, but it is the name of the Lord which is the prominent thing.
Ques. They will receive the one coming "in his own name"?
F.E.R. Yes; they are prepared for it. Here it is simply an ovation of the people, and the very people who cried "Hosanna" on this day will cry something else tomorrow.
Rem. We see Him as the "meek of the earth" here.
F.E.R. Yes; sitting on an ass, but then there is a great deal in meekness, it is the moral title for inheriting the earth. "Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth". The proud are not going to possess the earth, although they have it now, but it is the meek who "delight themselves in the abundance of peace". The amazing thing is that Christ should take that place. "I am meek and lowly in heart".
Ques. Was not their voice used of God in a way like Balaam's?
F.E.R. Well, it was allowed in that way; it comes out at the proper moment.
Ques. Is it not that those who were true led the way, and then the multitude followed?
F.E.R. Yes; that is likely enough. It is very like what happened in Christianity at the descent of the Holy Spirit. "It filled all the house where they were sitting", but the Holy Spirit really came on those who were true saints, though the influence went out beyond themselves.
Rem. Yes; and afterwards we read of a great company of the priests being obedient to the faith.
F.E.R. Yes; but you have no very great guarantee of their being truly converted.
{224}
Rem. How truly indeed we find that man is not to be trusted.
F.E.R. No; people can be affected for a moment, but when they get tested a bit they do not stand to it. Today it is "Hosanna", but to-morrow, "Crucify him, crucify him".
Rem. In becoming man He really secured the company that God had purposed.
F.E.R. Yes; to my mind, the greatest effect of the Lord's having been here was that He left a company here on whom the Holy Spirit could come. I do not see how otherwise the Holy Spirit could have come, if there had not been that company prepared for Him. It was a small company, a limited company, but still the Holy Spirit could come upon them, and therefore there is no limit to what the Holy Spirit could do. It reminds one of what the Lord said to them in @Matthew 16. You see, they were the bread -- they were the nucleus of what was to be, they were in the eyes of the Lord the beginning of what was to be. Then He warns them against the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees -- the Lord did not care about the mere bread at all, but the point of the passage is, they were the bread, and His great anxiety was lest they should be leavened. The Lord's public ministry was over, and everything now was bound up with that little company.
Rem. But that company that the Lord left has become leavened. I think you have noticed that whatever the Lord warns them of is sure to happen.
F.E.R. Yes. You look at the High Church party with its Pharisaism, and the Broad Church with its Sadduceeism -- that is what you have got in the present day. What do people want to wear garbs for, uniforms, and the like? It is as clear as daylight, that it is to put something on the natural man. What possible meaning can there be in it if it is not to put honour upon the natural man, to add something to him, to
{225}
give him an appearance? Now the moment you get that sort of thing it is Pharisaism. It distinguishes the natural man.
Ques. Do you think the Pharisees discover their weakness in verse 19?
F.E.R. Well, I think they were convinced of it, in a way; they saw the crowd gone after Him, but they need not have feared. It is remarkable how the disciples come out; they did not understand what they were doing at the time, but when Jesus was glorified then they remembered that they had done those things to Him. You get much the same thought at the beginning of the gospel.
Rem. Yes; in chapter 2 it shows what a necessity the coming of the Holy Spirit was for their understanding.
F.E.R. Yes; you see many of these things had reference to Christ in glory, and I very much doubt if they could have been understood until He was in glory. "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up". That really refers to Christ in glory. "In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily". Here the testimony is what belongs to Him now; He was the King of Israel, and testimony was borne to that, but He is that now, and therefore I think I can understand that they could not enter into it until He was in glory.
Rem. What you find at the end is that the resurrection really confirms the scripture.
F.E.R. Yes. "Destroy this temple, and ... I will raise it up".
Ques. Is the thought that God dwelt there?
F.E.R. Yes. You get the two expressions in Colossians. "In him all the fulness was pleased to dwell", and "In him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily" -- that is a statement that refers to the present, and not to the past. You get in chapter 7,
{226}
"The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified".
Rem. But when that was written, He had been given.
F.E.R. Yes. "The hour is coming, and now is" -- that is a remarkable way of putting it. It was the recognition of an hour that was coming, and yet giving it a present application. The disciples do not spare themselves. "These things understood not his disciples" -- who is it that recalls that? Why, a disciple -- they do not spare themselves a bit. It is very remarkable, when you come to think of it, how little *is* recorded by the disciples. Take the scene on the mount of Transfiguration -- you would certainly think that would be recorded by one of those who were there. Peter, it is true, refers to it in his second epistle, but he does not record it, not one of the three present records it. Neither Matthew, Mark, nor Luke was present, and John, who was present, does not mention it.
Ques. Does he not allude to it in the gospel where he says, "We beheld his glory"?
F.E.R. Well, at all events, it is not very certain.
Ques. In @John 1 they contemplated His own glory, the glory of *who* He was?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. Peter says, "He received from God the Father honour and glory". That is not exactly what John speaks about.
Rem. "A glory as of an only-begotten with a father".
F.E.R. Yes; he speaks of it in that way. John speaks of what was more characteristic, of what could have been seen every day by those who had eyes to see. "The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory" -- we contemplated His glory.
Ques. Like the Shekinah, in a way?
F.E.R. Yes; in a way. It would be very extraordinary
{227}
if they could have had the Lord dwelling among them and not have beheld His glory, and at any rate they must have been struck by the fact that He was not like themselves. I think that if you could conceive such a thing as that the Lord were dwelling among a company of ourselves, I think we should all have the sense, pretty strongly, that He was not like ourselves; you could not fail to see that He was very different from you. Even though you might be very attached to Him, as John was, still I feel sure that John felt how very different He was from himself.
Ques. Does not the expression "only-begotten" bring in the thought of affection?
F.E.R. Yes. He is the only one of that kind; it is the word, you know, used in the Old Testament in regard to Isaac. "Take now thy son, thine *only* son Isaac", it is the same word there.
Rem. And that was a very distinctive glory.
F.E.R. Yes. The Lord prays in chapter 17, "that they may behold my glory" -- but if you are to behold His glory you must be with Him. It is a remarkable thing that the Lord should have prayed that they should be with Him where He was; it was a peculiar favour for any one to be with Him where He was -- a very peculiar and distinctive place, do you not think so? I do not doubt that there may be circles in heaven who do not behold His glory in quite that way; they are quite aware of who He is, but it is another thing to contemplate His glory, I should say.
Rem. It will be our special place of nearness.
F.E.R. Yes. "I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also". I cannot think that the same thing will characterise every family in heaven.
Ques. Is that the thought in the "many mansions"?
F.E.R. Yes. I think so. I very much doubt if every family will have the place spoken of in the
{228}
passage quoted from chapter 17, "that they may behold my glory".
Rem. I think you have pointed out that there are several companies contemplated in @Psalm 45.
F.E.R. Yes. There are the queen, and the queen's daughter, and the virgins her companions -- a number of companies are contemplated; I do not of course say they are all heavenly companies. It speaks of that in Ephesians, "Of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named" -- not the whole family, as it is put, but every family.
Rem. And that which has formed the faith of the saints here must have its effect.
F.E.R. Yes. It depends on that by which it has been formed. The church is not formed by the promises; what the church is really formed by is the *known* love of God. That is the great formative principle in the church -- the known love of God as revealed in Christ. Nothing can "separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord". What is formed on that is of a very peculiar character -- a very wonderful character.
Ques. Would you look at this as a figure of the coming blessing, the Gentiles coming up to the Jews (verse 20)?
F.E.R. Those were Greek proselytes, I suppose, "Sir, we would see Jesus".
Ques. In verse 23, "The hour is come" -- to what does that refer, the cross or resurrection?
F.E.R. I think it is the future glory that the Lord is contemplating, when everything will be put under Him. "The hour is come", that is, morally. He had been owned as coming "in the name of the Lord", and then those Greeks were coming to see Him; it is that combination of things that brings it before the mind of the Lord. I do not think it is a point of time but of that combination of circumstances; you must take a thing in connection with its context, and not
{229}
always attach the same force to the same expression; here, you must certainly take account of the context. It is the combination of circumstances that brings before the Lord the hour when all things will be put under His feet. "The hour is come" was a sort of finish-up to the picture of what is to come; but then He goes on immediately to show that all must be by His *death*. No doubt the disciples would have been very well pleased to have the Greeks subject to Him then, and to think that the hour had already come.
Rem. "The desire of all nations".
F.E.R. Yes; and all that passes in review before the mind of the Lord, and brings before Him the hour when the Son of man should be glorified. Had that hour then come He must have been alone -- He was alone in life, for all were under death.
Ques. I suppose this would be earthly glory?
F.E.R. Yes; the accomplishment of @Psalm 8.
Ques. What is meant by "still the enemy and the avenger"?
F.E.R. Well, the cry of the faithful will be heard, they will be vindicated; and then the enemy will be stilled, silenced. Nothing affected the Lord down here, or turned Him aside; in one sense they affected Him very much, but they could not divert Him.
Ques. You see how He was affected in chapter 11?
F.E.R. Yes; but He was not turned aside, He went His path, He was in the light. I defy any reasonable person to read the gospels and not to see that you are in the presence of One who knew all that was before Him. He walked in the light, and He says, "Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not" -- the Lord walked in the day, and in the light. He came from God and went to God -- that just describes His path.
Rem. And in chapter 13: 3 He is in the full knowledge of everything.
F.E.R. Yes; but He was that all the way through,
{230}
He knew that that was the way to God through the cross. He knew that there was fulness of joy at the right hand of God; it was not down here, though He might say, "The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage" down here, but fulness of joy was in the presence of God. The greatest miracle that could be conceived would be that the Lord was an impostor -- that would be a miracle. No, the Lord came into this world with a steadfast purpose before Him. He would be "made a little lower than the angels *for the suffering of death*". Whatever He might do on the road in the way of works of goodness, and testing -- as His presence *must* -- His people, yet, in all, His path was to *death*. I do not see how He could become a man and fail of death, as things were. If He took up man, the seed of the woman, it was morally certain that He must go into death -- there would have been something morally defective without that.
Ques. What is the aspect of death here?
F.E.R. I think everything springs up from the death of Christ; we all have to go through the death of Christ, we all have to come from the death of Christ. Christ went into death actually, and we go into it in mind; what Christ entered into in *fact*, we enter into in *mind*. "I am crucified with Christ", that is in mind. We all come from the death of Christ.
Rem. It is looked at as fruit for God.
F.E.R. Yes. Everything comes out of the death of Christ. His death, in John, has always the company in view. He brings forth fruit of His own genus, of His own kind. The corn of wheat goes into the ground and dies -- it must die -- but then it brings forth fruit a hundredfold. "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit". As a corn of wheat it must dissolve, it ceases to be what it was, but then other corn of its own kind springs up. The fruit is
{231}
not of a different kind, it is of the same kind as Himself in that sense.
Ques. The same in nature, but different in glory?
F.E.R. Yes; and in form.
Rem. If we are to be on the same platform as Christ, we could not be put upon that apart from death.
F.E.R. Yes; you have got to lose all that you are, there is not a bit of the "old man" in the "new man"; the "new man" is entirely new -- a different man, it is not an old thing made to look like new, as you see in tailors shops sometimes. There is not a bit of the old man in the new man; we have come out of the grave of Christ in the character of Christ -- as He is -- "As is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly".
CHAPTER 12: 24 TO END
F.E.R. The language we get here, I think, must, to a great many people, seem almost an enigma. I am sure it must be an enigma to any but a spiritual mind, because really we are in exactly the same world, and the world itself is exactly the same, and yet we get such expressions as, "If any one serve me, let him follow me". The world is not a bit changed, that is certain, and I am still in it, and yet there are the Lord's words still addressed to us as forcibly as ever. I think people can understand the idea of earth; we all know something about the earth, and most people have an idea of heaven, but it is a very great deal more difficult to take in the idea of heavenly ground whilst still down here. It is certainly a thing which none but a spiritual mind could possibly understand.
Ques. Is that what is meant by following Him?
F.E.R. The Lord must have meant that when He said, "there shall also my servant be". Of course we are not yet in heaven, that is certain.
Rem. What is on the other side is the only thing that lasts.
{232}
F.E.R. Yes; the other side of death. I do not think, as you say, that there is anything *safe* but the resurrection platform; and yet it is a very mythical platform to any but a spiritual mind. Man regards the earth as stable, but even that quakes sometimes; still, man knows something of the earth, and he knows something about heaven, but there is in Scripture something which is far more difficult to take in.
Ques. In what sense is it to "serve" here?
F.E.R. Oh, to minister; it is the same word as 'deacon'. You remember "they had John to their minister" -- that is, he helped them in their work.
Rem. And the servant to be efficient must take his place with the Lord.
F.E.R. I think so. I think he needs to be on the platform where divine power is active.
Ques. Did you say "*is* acting"?
F.E.R. *Has* acted. Resurrection is, I think, the ground which God has established, and where divine power has been displayed.
Ques. Over Jordan?
F.E.R. Yes; that is where Christ is, that is perfectly certain. Christ is not this side of Jordan, it is on the other side that you find Him -- "there shall also my servant be".
Rem. In the type, in the case of the children of Israel, they were, in a certain sense, in resurrection, I suppose, in the wilderness. They had come through the Red Sea.
F.E.R. No, I do not think so. Christ was in resurrection, and faith in Christ risen was typified, but I think to have resurrection experimentally you must bring together the Red Sea and Jordan -- make them coalesce, in that way.
Rem. Is it not true that many a person has been through the Red Sea who has not gone over Jordan?
F.E.R. Yes; I think there is a great deal of difference between the two.
{233}
Ques. How far does service go here; is it in its wide sense?
F.E.R. I do not know at all; it is just the common word for serve, "If any man serve me", it is the idea of ministering to Christ. You see the obligation which the Lord puts upon such an one. "If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am" -- not where I *shall* be, but where I *am* -- "there shall also my servant be".
Ques. What do you think the Lord means by that, "where I am"?
F.E.R. The Lord was always morally outside this scene, though He passed out of it entirely by death; but still, in one sense, I think it made very little difference to Him, because He was morally always outside of it.
Rem. There is a great deal of service where you cannot think that the servants are on the resurrection platform, is there not?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. The true character of service is to lead people on to that ground, and a man must be on it himself before he can lead others on to it. What they seek is to bring the grace of God to people here, but it is too limited -- it stops short. It is perfectly right and true to tell people that Christ died for our sins, but then you must not ignore the other part of it, to "deliver us from this present evil world". You must not cloak that part of it, merely taking the first part and leaving out the second. Light has come into the world, not for people to have light *in* the world, but to show them the way out of it.
Ques. Why do you think people are so afraid of telling the whole truth?
F.E.R. Well, I think they are -- that is, many of the evangelists -- afraid to confess the sovereignty of God's purpose. I think that, in principle, they are Arminian.
Ques. And what is that?
{234}
F.E.R. I think they look at the gospel as that which man can receive or reject, that is how they present the gospel; they are afraid almost to look in the face the sovereignty of the will of God. If they did but take it in, and worked more on that line, the effect of their work would be to lead people out of the world, and to bring them where Christ is. I quite admit, of course, that it is in the power of man to reject the gospel, and a great many do reject it, and they will come under the responsibility of rejecting. "Light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light".
Rem. The fact is that all would have rejected the gospel but for the sovereignty of God.
F.E.R. Yes; that is really the case, and even in the gospel of Luke you get, "Compel them to come in", and then, too, "None of them that were bidden shall taste of my supper". They were bidden and they did not come.
Rem. "Through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins", but then, "Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets".
F.E.R. Yes; and it goes on: "Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish" -- and in that connection it is added, "As many as were ordained to eternal life believed".
Ques. What does "ordained" mean?
F.E.R. It is just the common word; it is to put in order with a view to a certain result.
Here (verse 27) the Lord goes on to say, "Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour. Father, glorify thy name". I think the Lord was recognising the ground on which everything was going to be placed; I think the Father's name was to be glorified in resurrection; because resurrection
{235}
really brings out the glory of the Father. Resurrection really is that in which the Father is revealed.
Rem. "Raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father".
F.E.R. Yes; that is the new ground, that in which the Father is displayed. "The Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them" -- you get that in chapter 5, it originates in the Father. I think the Son does it because the Father does it: "As the Father raises the dead and quickens them, thus the Son also quickens whom he will" -- it is that in which the Father is displayed. It is in consequence of what *God* is that man will have to be raised for judgment; but that would not be the glory of the Father. Man being such as he is, and God being such as He is, man has to come into judgment, but there is no declaration of the Father's name in that. The Father raises up the dead and *quickens*. "The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father". What the Father does is, He raises up the dead and quickens, and the Son does what He sees the Father doing.
Rem. That is the force of "I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again" (verse 28).
F.E.R. Yes; it is the Father's glory; but the character of everything that is raised, subjectively, is derived from the *Son* -- it takes its character from the Son, and the Father is glorified thereby, because the Son of God will be expressed. In the church, for instance, it is all taken out of death, that He may be expressed by it, but He is glorified subjectively. The Father's glory is more connected with His counsel, it is that which reveals the Father. The revelation of the Father is bound up with resurrection. I do not see how the Father could act in a scene of death. He could not act within that sphere, but He acts outside it.
Ques. He brings one up out of it?
{236}
F.E.R. Yes, that is it.
Ques. And He works that way in quickening?
F.E.R. Yes; He puts you outside of it too.
Ques. In chapter 17, "Glorify thou me" -- is that in resurrection?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. And the subjective thing is, "All ... thine are mine; and I am glorified in them". The Father is glorified in the accomplishment of His counsel.
Rem. And the Lord is glorified, would you say, in the number of those who are quickened into the same likeness?
F.E.R. Yes; "I am glorified in them". I do not think it was that the Lord Himself was glorified at that particular moment in the disciples, but He is glorified in the fact that all that comes out of death takes its character from Him. It is the Father that raises up the dead and quickens them, it originates in the Father, that is the way the Lord puts it in chapter 5 -- He "quickens whom he will".
Rem. All this latter part of John anticipates the fact that resurrection has taken place?
F.E.R. Yes; it is so all through in a way. The fact is this, that the whole of the gospel of John is entirely outside of every dispensation here. That is nothing new, but it comes home to one more and more as the gospel comes before us afresh. It is the unfolding of the Father's name, the glory of the Father.
Rem. That starts in chapter 1?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. He could not work in this sphere, His work is all outside. It is not, however, to take people to heaven, but to put people on heavenly ground down here.
Rem. "I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world".
F.E.R. No; but "that thou shouldest keep them from the evil".
{237}
Ques. What is the bearing of the expression, "ascend up" (chapter 6: 62)?
F.E.R. He was going up because the Father had the first claim upon Him. If He is raised up from the dead, the Father had the first claim upon Him. The Lord shows the direction He takes and it is our proper direction too, we are ascending up in that sense.
Rem. You do not get the ascension really in John. He was always with the Father, and therefore there is no need of ascension, as such.
F.E.R. No; He was "the only-begotten Son ... in the bosom of the Father" -- and the great point in the gospel is to put us in the same place morally.
Rem. As a man He came into the world to accomplish the Father's will.
F.E.R. Yes; it is that which enables you to understand the latter part of the chapter. "I am come a light into the world". He was a light in the world because He revealed the Father. Then, of course, there was this also, that the ground had to be cleared for God. The man that stood in the way had to be removed, the man that existed -- "Now is my soul troubled". I think the first man had to be removed in order that Christ might fill everything, to make room for Christ. There was no room for Christ until the first man was removed.
Ques. Was the first man removed in figure at the Red Sea?
F.E.R. I do not think so. You see, all those different types of the death of Christ coalesce, all the types refer to the one death of Christ. We may have different aspects of it presented to us, but there is, of course, only one death, and all the types combine to set it forth. The death of Christ, as it was before God, was in its completeness; we only apprehend it in detail.
Rem. This chapter brings out, more than any, the necessity of His death.
{238}
F.E.R. Yes; and the Lord was in the consciousness of what was involved in order that the offending man might be removed from before God. God was to have to say to man apart from sin, and the flesh, and death, but then all these things had to be met to the glory of God. Christ had to enter into everything, He was made sin, "who knew no sin", and He was made "in the likeness of sinful flesh", and He had to "taste death". He had to taste it all; in death He had to taste what it meant, so that it might be in the power of God to have to say to man entirely apart from sin, and the flesh, and death. What the gospel virtually says is, Death has ended all for Him, it is all closed up for Him, and therefore God can present Himself to man -- can approach man -- entirely apart from the question of sin, or death, or the flesh.
Ques. He approaches in Christ in resurrection?
F.E.R. Yes; He Himself is on the ground of resurrection in His approach to man. God takes that ground in approaching man. It is as though He said, "I am free to approach you now, entirely apart from any question of sin, or flesh, or death -- the blood of Christ is the witness that all is gone". But then this could not be the case unless all these things had been entered into. God "made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin" -- Christ had to enter into all. "When thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin" -- a sacrifice for sin; and then "God sending his own Son ... condemned sin in the flesh" -- that is a very serious matter.
Rem. It comes out here that He felt the seriousness of the matter.
F.E.R. Quite so; but then I think the great thing was this, that man might be displaced -- the sinful man in whom God had been dishonoured -- he was to be eternally displaced and removed to make room for Christ, if you can understand, *subjectively*. Not to make room for Christ to reign, but to make room for
{239}
Christ in you and in me; that Christ might be formed in us. He could not be formed in us if the first man had not been removed, I should have to bear the brunt of what I am; but in order to do His pleasure you must have *yourself* removed. There is no room for the two, you could not have Ishmael and Isaac together. All went in the death of Christ -- that man went, and there it is, too, that you get reconciliation -- the distance is gone, because the man has gone, but all really to make room for Christ.
Ques. This would not quite answer to Gethsemane?
F.E.R. Well, it is very near akin to it. "Now is my soul troubled" -- it is in anticipation of what was before Him there, and so here too. His soul was "exceeding sorrowful, even unto death". What could the Lord pray for but to be saved from that hour? "When he had offered up ... strong crying and tears" -- but then He renders up all unto the Father's will, "for this cause came I unto this hour".
Rem. Then He says, "Father, glorify thy name".
F.E.R. Yes; that is His prayer here. He does say, "Father, save me from this hour", but adds, "but for this cause came I unto this hour". The Lord was willing to say, "Father, glorify thy name", but He would not naturally say it. How could the Lord have any satisfaction in the thought that He would be made sin, and that He would be forsaken of God? He was perfect Man in that sense.
Ques. And He would not have been perfect if He had not shrunk from it all?
F.E.R. No. The presenting God to man -- that side was a joy to Him; it was His real joy to present God to man; but here it is His bearing man's portion before God, it is another thing altogether. This is the character pretty much of the latter part of the Lord's pathway, bearing what lay upon man -- entering into man's portion. It was no longer active service in presenting God to man. He had said, "I am come a
{240}
light into the world" -- I can tell you what is in the heart of God -- that is what He virtually said. Really I think it is a wonderful thing to be able to tell people what is in the heart of God for man.
Rem. But now that is over, and He has come to another thing altogether.
F.E.R. Yes; it is another service, bearing man's portion now to make room for the Father's glory, and for His own glory too. You know, I think people expect to see the power of God set forth in connection with this scene, and I think, too, it is that same power of God operating outside this scene that will eventually set this scene aside. He will "bring to nought things that are". You see, you must have the Man-child complete, and then He will be caught up to God and to His throne; then the second great thing is the revival of Israel. Israel is to be brought up again from the dead, and then, whenever Israel is revived, everything becomes simple. God will simply use certain means to weaken all that now exists, and the world is not so mighty as some people seem to think. Why, even now you get unexpected catastrophes coming; in these last two or three days we have had things happening which were totally unexpected, and it is quite within the power of God to bring things to pass to weaken the world. It will be quite easy for God to bring about the setting aside of what now exists -- that is all I mean. The wonderful thing will be the revival or restoration of Israel.
Ques. Where does "the stone cut out of the mountain" come in, before or after Israel is revived; @Daniel 2?
F.E.R. Oh, Israel is revived before that; the time of Jacob's trouble is before that, then the stone cut out without hands comes in, and the whole image is broken down. I have said sometimes, and I am prepared to stand by it, that the resurrection of Christ was the one act of God's power.
{241}
Rem. All else is only subsidiary.
F.E.R. Yes; and they follow as a natural consequence. People are so taken up with detail, and it is so very difficult -- to most people -- to grasp great principles. The resurrection of Christ is not simply a fact, or an event, but the great principle of the thing. God showed the "exceeding greatness of his power" when He raised Christ. The glory of the Father comes in there, and the Son is glorified, because everything takes its character from the Son. "I am glorified in them", I think, too, that Christ will be glorified in Israel -- that is my impression, because they say, "The Lord our Righteousness", and if He is their righteousness, He must be their life, the two things must go together.
Rem. It seems to be essential that they should have the King in righteousness, and He is the King.
F.E.R. Yes. "Jehovah our Righteousness". It is first the name by which He shall be called, and then, later on, it is the name by which she shall be called. But if she takes His name she takes His character. It is so, too, in regard of the church, if she takes His name she also takes His character.
Ques. Would you say that the death of Christ established everything for Israel?
F.E.R. It established everything for God, and therefore everything for man. The one thing to me is that God can have to say to man apart from sin, and the flesh, and death. Of course it is a long time before one can take it in, but if you look at the thing on the divine side, you must see it. "Christ Jesus whom God hath set forth a mercy-seat". Then, too, you get, "The God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant" -- but you notice that it is the God of *peace*, and it was He that brought again our Lord Jesus from the dead. Peter preached repentance and remission of sins
{242}
through His name, though all was over as to the flesh; Christ had been presented to them, and they had rejected Him; there was no help for them after the flesh, but Christ is raised up from the dead, and God has exalted Him to be a "Prince and a Saviour", to give repentance and remission of sins. You know, some people seem to think it a total impossibility for Israel to be raised again as a nation, but all it wants is the moral question settled -- a work of God in them.
Rem. You see that in Ezekiel, "Can these bones live?"
F.E.R. Yes; and they can live when God works in them, and Israel will come again into national existence, and then Babylon will be overthrown. You never find them in Scripture together; if Jerusalem is in the ascendant, then Babylon is not heard of, the two things cannot go on together. Babylon is man's glory, but Jerusalem is God's glory. Babylon began at Babel; man set to work to build a tower and a city; Jerusalem is God's glory, the city of the great King, but God will not have Jerusalem and Babylon together. Babylon might, of course, be Rome or the reconstructed Roman Empire, but it is morally Babylon. I do not care what name it has, it is morally Babylon.
Rem. It is evident that it is a principle in Scripture, because you get mention of a Babylonish garment before ever there was a Babylon in the full sense.
F.E.R. Yes; a Babylonish garment and a wedge of gold -- man's glory and covetousness, it is not only that he wants a covering, but he would like the gold too. I believe it is these things that man is after. Where is the man in the world now who does not seek a wedge of gold and a Babylonish garment? You get a man of any capacity in the world, and that is pretty much what he seeks, a Babylonish garment and a wedge of gold. Of course man, as man, does not like the thought of dependence on God, he is very fond of
{243}
human glory. I was thinking only yesterday that even the poorest people in the world would not care for everyone to be on the same dead level, for though they may have no part in the glory of the world, they love the glory of the world. And among the middle classes, although they have no part in the upper circle, yet it exercises a great power over them, they would not care to have everything reduced to "two acres and a cow". Of course, there are professional socialists who agitate so as to produce a general scramble, by which they themselves would secure a benefit, but at the bottom they would not care for a state of things in which everyone would be on one dead level.
Ques. I suppose that these people who heard the voice from heaven really knew nothing of what it meant?
F.E.R. No; it was to them an enigma, and yet it says it came for their sake. Then afterwards it comes out that everything is closed up as to the world, and the testimony of God from henceforth must change its character. It is no longer a Man presenting God here, but it is deliverance out of the world. "I, if I be lifted up ... will draw all unto me".
Ques. You mean there is no more saying to the world?
F.E.R. Oh, no. "Now is the judgment of this world" -- it is something much more definite than had ever been before. I think the whole system of the world is exposed and judged for God; but then, at the same time, the system of the world is completely closed up for the believer. I think it is we who judge it, the believer judges the whole system. It is judged for God, and it is judged, too, for us -- for faith.
Ques. In what sense does He draw all to Him? Is it that the Lord is an Object outside all here?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. I think you have to accept the reproach of His being lifted up, you have to go forth to Him without the camp, bearing His
{244}
reproach, you have to accept the reproach. He is lifted up in divine counsel, but there is also the reproach, as they said of Paul, "It is not fit that he should live". Here you find the people puzzling over things; they could not understand anything at all, because they did not accept the Lord's word. They could not understand the voice from heaven, and then they say, "Who is this Son of man?" The secret of it was that they did not accept the Lord's own testimony, which would have made it all simple, but they say, "How sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up?" I think they understood it to mean death, "lifting up" evidently meant that to their minds in contrast to abiding for ever. They did not know that even Christ after the flesh could not abide for ever, but they had the clue to it in the Lord's own words. Of course, it was to them an enigma how on the one hand Christ must abide for ever, and on the other, the Son of man must be lifted up. The clue to it all is that He is Son of God. Death involved no change to Him on that line although it might change His condition as the Son of man, or as the Christ. The fact is this, all that links to the wilderness, in that sense, goes in the wilderness; all that pertained to the wilderness ended there. But then, I think, there is that which abides, the Son of God abides. He is the Son of man which is in heaven, and whatever is in heaven abides, there is no change there.
Rem. How it all hangs on who the Person is!
F.E.R. Yes; that is the secret of the whole question.
Rem. "Whose Son is he?"
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. Is not reconciliation connected with the Son of God?
F.E.R. Reconciliation is that love has come in, and therefore the distance is gone. We are "reconciled
{245}
to God by the death of his Son". But who *could* bring in the love of God but the Son? It is love brought in in the place of distance. The Son of God comes into death and now distance is gone and love is there.
Ques. Then it comes in on the love side, not the expiatory side?
F.E.R. Yes. But the Lord goes on, "Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light". It is most remarkable how, time after time, the Lord just goes on, He does not answer their questions as to who is this Son of man, but you get, "Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you", etc. -- that was the point, "Walk while ye have the light" -- "While ye have light, believe in the light".
Ques. He judges their moral condition?
F.E.R. Yes; and it was not a question of satisfying their curiosity. He speaks as regards their immediate responsibility. The light was there -- "No man hath seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him" -- there was a declaration of God there.
Ques. I suppose a person truly exercised does not ask curious questions?
F.E.R. Oh, no. The important point to them really was what God was, what the attitude of God was towards man, but they took no account of the testimony of the Lord in regard to that. "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses" -- that was the light that the Lord brought, but they took no account of that, they disregarded that, and they asked questions about this thing and that thing, just the things that puzzled them.
Then, towards the close of the chapter, there is a remarkable passage, "Yet they believed not on him", and then the fulfilment of Scripture is brought in,
{246}
setting forth the existing state of things in their rejection of the testimony which the Lord brought to them. He gives the greatest possible weight to the Scriptures.
Ques. It is the comment of the Holy Spirit on them?
F.E.R. Yes. "I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness". He was the light in revealing the Father. I think, in another sense, the Lord hid Himself in revealing the Father, if one might venture to use the expression, when He spoke the Father's words. He hid Himself in the Father, in that way.
Rem. "I have not spoken of myself".
F.E.R. No; He did not proclaim what belonged to Him -- He was the humblest of men down here. He hid Himself in making known the Father. He was really making known what was in the heart of God towards man.
Rem. He makes a very solemn summary at the end of the chapter.
F.E.R. Yes; very solemn -- it is the word which He had spoken which should judge them. The Father's commandment was life eternal -- that is the most remarkable expression -- His commandment is life eternal, and it must stand because it is the Father's commandment. It is what He has ordained, it is His counsel; "There he commanded the blessing, even life for evermore" -- He ordained it.
CHAPTER 13
F.E.R. Public ministry is all over. The hour had come when He should depart out of the world -- the time for public ministry was over, and the fact that the hour had come makes it evident, I think.
Ques. You refer to the Lord's own ministry?
{247}
F.E.R. Yes; you must expect, from this point, to get a new line of instruction.
Ques. I suppose chapter 12: 44 gives you the last of Christ's public ministry?
F.E.R. Yes; it is a kind of closing word. The Lord has the last word, in that sense.
Rem. What we get here as to the Supper is given rather differently in the other gospels.
F.E.R. Yes; John presents it in a different light.
Rem. It seems here that the Lord is more occupied with the subjective work in them.
F.E.R. Yes; that is the character all through John. The teaching all through John is on the subjective side, because it is all *life*.
Rem. Now a new kind of teaching is coming out, because He is going out of the world, back to the Father?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. Things were to be on wholly new ground, not now in connection with His presence here, but on wholly new ground as being with the Father. In the previous chapter you get, "Now is the judgment of this world" -- things have come to an issue, and the Holy Spirit can convict the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment. Any testimony therefore that God presents to man down here must be for the purpose of leading souls out of the world.
Rem. Though we are still in the world, yet a way is made for us out of the world.
F.E.R. Yes, that is it. Light is come in to deliver people morally out of the world. The great point now is that God speaks to man on the ground of resurrection. He addresses Himself now to man apart from the question of sin, or the flesh, and the necessary answer to that is, that if you are to have to say to God it must be apart from sin and the flesh too. Well, what have you got for this world? If you can divest a man of sin and the flesh, what has he got? There is
{248}
nothing left of him for this world. Therefore it seems to me that the fact of the light of God coming in is to bring deliverance to man -- it is the necessary consequence of it, and the more the light comes home, the more really deliverance is appreciated.
Ques. I could not enjoy the light as a natural man?
F.E.R. No, you could not. I do not say that the light may not have the effect of exercising people, but you could not *enjoy* it. You can only enjoy it in the fact of being apart from what God is apart from. You could not possibly enjoy the light and yet sanction things from which God is apart. If God has to say to people apart from sin and the flesh, you could not enjoy that light if you were indulging sin and the flesh, you must be apart from that.
Ques. Standing in favour is quite another ground?
F.E.R. Oh, yes; another ground entirely. A man who wants to sanction sin and the flesh could not enjoy the light of God when God presents Himself apart from it.
Ques. Is not the object of deliverance in Romans that I might enjoy the light; but then there is a further deliverance?
F.E.R. Yes; that you might have a place with God, in the reality of what God is in Himself, that is a further step. You are to be associated with Christ in the consciousness of that, not simply in the light of God. That carries you further.
Ques. Does not that put you in the circle of His interests here?
F.E.R. Yes, that is further still. You must have been in to Him before you can come out for Him; you come out from Him for His interests here. That is further on still, in a way.
Ques. You get both of these things in John?
F.E.R. Yes; in chapter 14 you are in with Him, and in chapter 16 you come out.
Ques. Do you go in at all in @Romans 8?
{249}
F.E.R. Oh, no; the point there is that the Spirit has, in a way, displaced the flesh.
Rem. You go in to Him while down here.
F.E.R. Yes. This chapter is rather what is preparatory to it, it shows you what is an absolute necessity before you can have part with Christ.
Ques. What is that, to have part with Him?
F.E.R. Well, you have here the idea of purification -- you must have your feet washed before you can have part with Christ. The service of Christ is indispensable if we are to have part with Him.
Ques. Would you at all connect this with @Numbers 19 -- the red heifer?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so; only here it is to bring you under the sense of your obligation to one another, the Lord puts it in that way. He sets them an example, and puts them under an obligation to follow His example, "Ye also ought to wash one another's feet". At the present time Christ does not wash our feet directly, but mediately.
Ques. Through His own?
F.E.R. Yes; I think that is the idea of it. He did it here really to give them an example, but He puts us under the obligation to do it one for the other. "If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them".
Ques. What is meant by "washed all over"?
F.E.R. Well, that is a work we could not possibly do for one another. Even if we have grace to wash one another's feet, it is really Christ who does it, only He does it mediately. For instance, if I had grace to wash your feet, it would be Christ doing it, but He does it in that sense through me, or through you.
Ques. Is the obligation much fulfilled?
F.E.R. Well, I do not know, but I am rather afraid comparatively little. We are very much more prone to descant upon one another's deficiencies than to try and remove them. It is a very easy thing to make one another's failures a subject of talk, instead of
{250}
being under the obligation to seek to remove them.
Rem. And you would have the sense that it was a pleasure to Him to do so.
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. In Numbers it was the office of one who was clean?
F.E.R. Yes; he would not attempt to do it if he were not clean himself.
Ques. What is the connection of verse 3?
F.E.R. I think it gives us a complete view of the ground on which the Lord acts. The Father gives all things into His hand, it is like the end of chapter 3, "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things [to be] in his hand" -- everything is put on that ground. You see the greatness of Christ. The great stumbling-block with infidels is as to how God can put Himself in relation with a man down here; they only look at God in the light of creation, and it is a great stumbling-block to them how God can put Himself in communication with a man down here; but then they only judge from themselves. They betray themselves because they judge everything according to man -- just what a *man* would do if he were under the circumstances, which is a thing impossible to conceive of.
Ques. Is there any significance, do you think, in the Lord's action being connected with the Supper?
F.E.R. Well, He rises from the Supper -- the expression is really, "supper being about" -- He rises from the Supper; rising is significant in that way, He breaks up all that association, it broke up the meal, and all that character of association in which Christ had been with them down here. Then He takes another attitude with regard to them.
Ques. Are there not two things that come out in the chapter, the Supper, and then the "devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot ... to betray him"?
{251}
F.E.R. Yes; and He anticipates it. The very fact of Satan having put it into one heart to betray Him broke up the circle. When once treachery came into that little circle, it was entirely broken up. I was pointing it out in connection with Joseph's brethren, it is very striking in their case; before they denied Joseph they were powerful as a company, but afterwards they became weak. Here treachery had come into the circle, and in the hour of His betrayal they "all forsook him and fled".
I think the significance of His rising from supper is that all that order of things was broken up, and He takes another attitude in regard to them. Then the truth comes in, the necessity of our being maintained in moral cleanness down here. This chapter is only preparatory; but, in regard to the wilderness, you must be maintained in moral cleanness if you are to be with God. He came "from God, and went to God", and if you are to follow Him, you must be maintained in moral cleanness down here.
Ques. Is that His priestly service?
F.E.R. No, not exactly; because you get the two things coming in in Numbers, the priesthood and the water of purification -- you must have both. I think you get the subjective side here -- more the water of purification.
Ques. "Clean every whit" -- is that new birth?
F.E.R. It goes farther than new birth; it is the effect of the truth upon you. It would, of course, include it, but it carries you on beyond it. I think a man "clean every whit" is a man really formed in the divine nature where the word has taken effect, and a man is *formed* by the light -- it is then that he is clean every whit. Of course a Christian, as far as the work of God is concerned, is already clean in the very nature of the thing -- what is born of God cannot commit sin.
Rem. He says of them, "Now ye are clean through
{252}
the word which I have spoken". He does not say through the blood or through death.
F.E.R. Oh, no; the Spirit of God uses the testimony of God to form you in that testimony; the word of God may be the testimony of His love; but then the Spirit of God forms you in that testimony, in the divine nature. "The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given unto us", etc. It is really by God's testimony, in the death of Christ, that the Holy Spirit brings home to you the light of God's love, and then He forms you by that; a man is clean by the word, he is formed in the divine nature by the word.
Ques. Is there not a similarity between this and @Ephesians 5, "that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word"?
F.E.R. Yes, in that sense. But there it looks at the thing in its completeness, not in detail as here. Here it is the obligation to wash one another's feet, but there it is simply and purely what Christ does.
Ques. And the word is the only pure water?
F.E.R. Yes. As to the water of purification, you remember it was mingled with the ashes of the red heifer; they were laid by in a clean place, and then running water was put to them, and that constituted the water of purification.
Ques. How would you distinguish between that and the laver?
F.E.R. I think the washing at the laver was more connected with the condition on which they could approach to God. It is a necessity and condition of approach to God that you must be dead from the world, washed from the filth of the world. The teaching of the laver is more that to me, like "your bodies washed with pure water". It is purification from the world, but that is not quite the idea here; it is not being washed from that system, as with the laver, but here it is more a question of detail, and
{253}
proper Christian care for one another. You seek, instead of dwelling on defects, to accept your obligations to remove them. I think it is a great thing for us to accept our obligation to serve one another. It was really putting the disciples, in a kind of way, in His own place. He had taken the place Himself, He did not put upon them what He did not do Himself; but He takes the place Himself, and puts upon them the obligation to do as He had done. He did it first Himself, so that they could never say He had put upon them what He did not do Himself.
Ques. And that is, as you say, mediately now?
F.E.R. Yes; through you or through me.
Ques. Could this service come in preventively, as well as restoratively?
F.E.R. I think it supposes the contraction of evil -- I think it supposes a soil in a kind of way.
Ques. Is it a question of sin, would you say?
F.E.R. Well, I suppose it might be anything that tends to defile down here -- and it is not a very difficult thing to get under defiling influences. We are continually coming in contact with moral defilement.
Ques. I suppose that even being in the company of Judas would have been sufficient to defile them?
F.E.R. Yes; you cannot be in bad company without being affected, you cannot read bad books, or even a passage out of a bad book, without being contaminated. You read a thing, and you feel even as you read it that you are being contaminated. I know that by one's own experience. You read a thing almost by accident, and in the very reading of it you are defiled.
Ques. Does this take in more than defilement?
F.E.R. No, I should hardly think so; washing indicates the removal of something, would you not think so?
Ques. "He that is washed" -- what is that?
F.E.R. Well, that is a general thought there.
{254}
"He that is bathed" -- that indicates to me a person in whom the word has taken effect, and to whom it has brought deliverance.
Rem. Like the leper?
F.E.R. Yes; a person washed all over is a person dead to the world, but even in that place, as dead to the world, it is extremely possible that you may pick up some soil. You are never out of the wood while down here. But the point here is this, if you detect a soil in another, your obligation is to seek to remove it, it is that side of it here.
Ques. Is it similar to Galatians, a brother "overtaken in a fault"?
F.E.R. Yes; I think you get the idea there, and it says, "Ye which are spiritual, restore such an one".
Ques. And the first practical necessity is the deepest humility?
F.E.R. Yes, I think it is. I think it would work in the sense that the Lord has not charged us to do what He has not done Himself. "If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet", etc.
Ques. And you could not get a greater example than the Lord Himself?
F.E.R. No; and it is wonderful grace that puts you in the Lord's own place. It is not inconsistent with His greatness to stoop to wash their feet. His greatness is first brought out, but it is not inconsistent with that to wash their feet. And nothing, in that way, is inconsistent with love. Love delights in purity -- divine love -- and I do not think in that way that anything is inconsistent with love.
Rem. And it delights to serve, too.
F.E.R. Yes, quite so.
Ques. What would characterise our service for one another?
F.E.R. Well, this is not normal service, but abnormal, this service is consequent upon soil coming in.
{255}
Ques. Would this be necessary if we were all walking in self-judgment?
F.E.R. I think it is impossible for a Christian to go through the world without contamination, and the Lord knew that.
Ques. Is there no way of its being removed except through another?
F.E.R. There may no doubt be other ways, but here the Lord puts us under the obligation to remove it; you are not justified in taking no notice of it.
Rem. In Numbers it supposes a man getting defiled by what he cannot avoid.
F.E.R. Yes; you go through the world, and you cannot help getting contaminated.
Ques. Does the Lord never wash our feet?
F.E.R. Well, the Lord may do it, but you are under the obligation to do it. You would not try to do it in the meeting, although it might be done in the meeting without your knowing it.
Rem. Then does "He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me" come in in that connection?
F.E.R. Yes; and that shows again that it is really the Lord, though He says, "whomsoever I send".
Rem. The important point is to make it our own shame.
F.E.R. Yes; that is the important point, the reproach of one belongs to us all, if we really consider it.
Ques. Is the feet-washing always in view of "part with me"?
F.E.R. Yes; but you see how people love to expose others. If you consider men at all, you will find what a readiness there is to expose others. Look at all the papers that are written with an attempt to expose evil; what a spirit that is, it is totally opposed to the Spirit of Christ -- there is nothing of the Spirit of Christ in that.
Ques. How about things that are not known, would the Lord work directly in such a case?
{256}
F.E.R. Yes; but the point in this chapter is to put us under the obligation. He does something which is to be an example to them. The obligation which attaches to us is down here, the point being that we may have part with Him.
Ques. Is it the line you get in Peter, love covering a multitude of sins?
F.E.R. Yes. I do not think we very much understand what it is to have part with Christ if we do not understand our obligation to serve one another.
Ques. We are to serve all in love?
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. "Thou shalt not suffer sin upon thy brother", is it at all like that?
F.E.R. Yes; in your dealings with your brother there may be a kind of moral rebuke needed in order to bring his failure home to him, but it must be brought home to him, and here you are responsible for the removal of it.
Rem. "Ye which are spiritual" -- it supposes every one to be spiritual.
F.E.R. This is the proper character of a Christian. The more correct expression is, "ye being spiritual"; the apostle is speaking there, as he very often does speak, as to what they are properly. I would not say the washing would not sometimes take the form of a rebuke, to bring conviction, if it be needful.
Ques. But it was not essential in the Lord's case here?
F.E.R. Well, this was only a figure to teach them their moral obligation.
Ques. Do you think He washed Judas feet?
F.E.R. I do not know, that is all left. It says, "After he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments" -- it looks as if He had washed them all; but, after all, the action of the Lord in washing their feet was only figurative, as I have said.
Rem. He was wounded in the house of His friends.
{257}
F.E.R. Yes; the Lord says that Himself: "He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me". It is "mine own familiar friend", as in @Psalm 41.
Ques. Is not "part with me" being able to take our place on His side?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so -- "part with me" puts you there.
Rem. And that is no doubt our highest privilege.
F.E.R. You could not have anything much greater. That is the wonderful thing that has come to pass. God has shown out His pleasure in Christ risen from the dead that man may be apart, entirely apart in life, from all that is contrary to Himself; that is what God has shown out in Christ risen -- that is His pleasure. You are "risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead". "Part with me" does not properly refer to heaven, any more than "risen with Christ" does. It is on that side, but still on the earth, I am with Him as on earth.
Ques. Is there any link at all with the first verse?
F.E.R. Yes, a very great link; and that expresses very much what "part with me" is. You stand with Him apart from all that has been removed in His death, and the washing of the feet is that you may be perfectly consistent with it. It is heavenly ground.
Ques. But morally greater than heaven in a way?
F.E.R. Yes, I think it is. It is wonderful, too, as the hymn puts it,
<blockquote>"In Him we stand, a heavenly band, <br>Where He Himself is gone" (`12:2) </blockquote>
-- that does not exactly mean heaven; it is similar to what we had last week, "where I am, there shall also my servant be". He has gone on to heavenly ground, and we are one with Him there.
Ques. Is it not like "the Son of man who is in
{258}
heaven"? He was actually down here, and yet in the bosom of the Father.
F.E.R. I think it is a little difficult to prove such a thing by scriptures which apply strictly to Christ. When you think of Christ, He never left heaven in that sense. You have got another side to it, "In him all the fulness was pleased to dwell", and that makes it extremely difficult to apply the expression to us. You have part with Him, and you are risen with Him, but that is all consequent upon God's setting forth in Christ risen what His pleasure is, and that is, life out of death. When Christ was here after the flesh He was just as much in life as He was when risen, but He goes through death that man might be with Him in life out of death -- on that footing.
Ques. Why was Peter indignant that the Lord should wash his feet?
F.E.R. I think there was a good deal of *Peter* there; he did not at all apprehend that *Peter* had to go; he had not lost sight of *Peter*. He thought, of course, that it was derogatory to the Lord to wash his feet, but he did not know the obligation of love. It is a most difficult thing for a natural man to understand the obligation of love. Love has its own obligation, because it *is* love, and no natural man understands the obligation of love. No philosopher and no scientific man could possibly understand that love has its own obligation because it *is* love -- that God is love. Peter did not understand that at all; but while it was right of him, in a way, to think it was beneath the Lord's dignity to wash his feet, yet, if he had thought nothing about himself at all, he would have allowed the Lord to do what He pleased.
You get the perfection of love in the Lord. When God told Abraham to offer up Isaac He was teaching a most important and blessed lesson, that even Christ after the flesh must go. If God was to make Himself known to man, it must be outside of man, that is,
{259}
outside of death. That is the only way in which God could present Himself effectually to man. If God were to have to say to the flesh, what becomes of you and me? And therefore He wants you to learn the grace of God as entirely outside of sin in the flesh; you may be as much apart from sin in the flesh, as much delivered from it, as God is apart from it. He has condemned it.
Rem. -He has had His way in regard to it?
F.E.R. Yes; and therefore He presents Himself to man apart from it, because Christ is risen. We believe on Him who "raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification" -- that is your justification.
Ques. Does resurrection take you at all to heaven?
F.E.R. As we were saying a few minutes ago, it is heavenly ground, although you are here upon earth; you belong to heaven. It is like the Lord during the forty days in which He tarried upon earth, before He ascended.
Ques. But "raised us up together, and made us sit" really takes us to heaven?
F.E.R. Oh, yes; that is the act of God's power.
Ques. Being dead and risen with Christ, then, is not a question of our experience?
F.E.R. Well, it is that you are freed from the power of sin and the flesh, that is what "dead with Christ" means; but "risen together with Christ" is not experimental. I admit that I have often said otherwise, but it is perfectly clear to me now that it is just as much the pleasure of God that we are risen with Christ as that we are justified.
Ques. And yet a man cannot have it except as having been through death?
F.E.R. A man must have drunk the bitter waters of Marah in that way; he must accept his own bitter portion.
{260}
Ques. Has not the water some reference to the death of Christ?
F.E.R. The water, as I take it, has a reference to the water of purification made up with the ashes of the red heifer, and it has undoubtedly some reference to the death of Christ. This chapter is the great chapter of exposure, everything is exposed -- I mean the character of things -- everything is made bare in this chapter; Judas is exposed, and the weakness and faithlessness of Peter is brought to light. The Lord surveys everything in this chapter. He brings light to bear upon everything.
Rem. "Happy are ye if ye do them" -- you are happy in carrying out the will of the Lord.
F.E.R. Yes; your happiness lies not in having His words but in doing them. Happiness is not intelligence; the intelligent man may not be the happy man. I believe happiness lies in walking here in divine affections, and that is all the effect of light. Light is a most important thing; all affections in me are begotten by light.
Rem. Happiness always has others in view.
F.E.R. Yes, it is in serving others, and in carrying out our obligation to others. Love seeks not its own.
Rem. And so in one instance you get the expression, "The blessed God". That conveys the thought.
F.E.R. Yes, it does.
Ques. Might not that be translated the "happy God"?
F.E.R. Perhaps that is so, but it is an expression that grates on me. The word "blessed" is better. Words get a kind of meaning in human language, and become in that sense inapplicable to God. I think it is a most wonderful thing that this chapter is only the prelude to the instruction in chapter 14, that with all this in view the Lord could go on to what we have in chapter 14. With a perfect knowledge as to what they would meet down here in the world -- the contamination
{261}
and all that kind of thing -- Satan already at work with Judas, and with a perfect knowledge of Peter's weakness -- with a perfect knowledge of *everything*, the Lord goes on to chapter 14. The only thing is to trust Christ, because everything else will fail.
Rem. It was the night of His betrayal.
F.E.R. Yes; it was all betrayal; but what you get in this chapter abides.
Ques. And you must not be surprised at the treachery inside?
F.E.R. No; there is still treachery to Christ, and where do you find it? You do not find it among the heathen, or even among the Jews, but in Christendom; "of your own selves", that is where the perversion comes in.
The obligation to wash one another's feet cannot be carried out except in divine love. No merely legal attempt at it, or anything of that sort, would be of any value. I do not want just to tell the man his fault, but I would serve him in love. In nine cases out of ten one would fear it is to get a bit of credit to yourself. If I tell you that you tell lies, it means that I do not tell lies, but love covers everything. If you are detected in a fault, well, after all, there is no fault into which you fall into which I also might fall, if I were tempted.
Rem. You must first cast the beam out of your own eye before you can cast the mote out of your brother's eye.
F.E.R. Yes; the beam of legality and self-righteousness; you must get rid of that or else there is no love. This chapter to me is a wonderful chapter in the survey which the Lord takes, in a kind of way, of the whole scheme of things down here, and all that His own were exposed to.
Ques. Would you say the Lord was only engaged in their interests here?
F.E.R. Well, it reminds me of that expression in
{262}
@2 Corinthians 5, "Whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause". He was sober for their cause here, and then brings them to chapter 14: 1, and there shows them that they really had where to turn. We so poorly understand the mind of God in regard to the saints. There must be no breach of moral propriety, but mere moral propriety is not the standard -- the standard in this chapter is having part with Christ; everything that is inconsistent with that, unsuitable to that, is really condemned by the Lord.
Ques. Chapter 14 answers to "part with me"?
F.E.R. Yes. The Lord says, "I will come to you"; you have the assembly there. This chapter is only preparatory.
CHAPTERS 13: 18 TO 14: 3
F.E.R. This passage indicates a very great change from all that had been connected with the presence of the Lord here. The Lord says, "I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled", etc. I suppose it was meet that the Lord should experience every form of evil down here, that He should enter into all that man has experience of -- or rather that the saint has experience of. It is this which enables the Lord to sympathise with His people down here. There is nothing that they experience that the Lord Himself has not entered into. "He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me". It is this sympathy of the Lord which is needed to uphold His people when they are brought into contact with treachery and desertion.
Rem. I suppose everything culminates in this.
F.E.R. Yes; I think it is the worst form of evil you can experience.
Ques. Do you think Judas treachery is prophetic of the man of sin?
{263}
F.E.R. Well, I think it is prophetic of what Israel will experience in the last days; and here the point is that Christ entered into it, so that He could take up that language, "He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me". The Lord knew whom He had chosen, it was not that He was taken unawares.
Ques. But at the same time He felt the treachery?
F.E.R. Yes; and Judas had a certain appearance and exterior, and the Lord Himself had appointed him -- but he was a traitor. Then the Lord adds a very significant word, "From henceforth" -- it is an expression that makes me think that there was a great alteration in His position from this point. "From henceforth". I think it indicates a change; several times you get the expression: "From henceforth ye shall see the heavens opened", as here it is, "From henceforth I tell you before it come to pass". I do not think that you can take everybody down here in the world on trust now; you have to watch diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God, you cannot take everybody on trust.
Rem. There He is guarding them against apostasy.
F.E.R. Well, I think so. The Lord changes His attitude in this way. He Himself had chosen Judas, but now He changes His attitude and says, "From henceforth I tell you before it come to pass".
Ques. In what way do you mean He changes His attitude?
F.E.R. He exposes now.
Ques. Did He not expose before?
F.E.R. No; I do not think so. He had taken people before on trust. Judas had been taken on trust in that way.
Ques. And He was exposing what was inside now, what was in the circle?
F.E.R. Yes; and I think we have to be on our guard, too. We cannot take everybody on trust, it is instruction for us. "From henceforth" is for us.
{264}
Rem. But He had alluded to Judas before, "Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?"
F.E.R. Yes; but it becomes much more definite here. "He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me" -- Judas is completely exposed here by the sop.
Ques. What is signified by eating bread?
F.E.R. It is an act which expresses fellowship -- it implies fellowship.
Rem. You have in the chapter, first the supper, then the feet-washing, and then, "Now is the Son of man glorified", but I do not see quite why He changes His attitude there, I do not see the connection with what follows.
F.E.R. I think you get the human side in those first verses, it is more looking at people on the human side.
Rem. The first seventeen verses.
F.E.R. Well, in what I was speaking of just now. Then you come more to the divine side in verse 32; everything from that point onwards is on that side. Down here, in a kind of way, you cannot take everything as it appears, and I have no doubt that if we were dependent upon the Lord a traitor would be exposed. The Lord would make a traitor known in that sense, if we were more dependent upon Him. You see how, in the early days of the church, traitors "crept in unawares", but if the saints had been nearer to the Lord I have no doubt the traitor would have been exposed. The only resource is the Lord. We get people into fellowship who turn out regular troublers, but perhaps if we had been more dependent upon the Lord they would have been exposed before ever they came in to trouble us. I think if we were conscious of all that side of things, we should be conscious of how very much we are dependent on the Lord, cast on the Lord. Sometimes we are too ready to get people into fellowship, and it is not very difficult
{265}
always, but what are they going to be when they are in fellowship? We may be too anxious to get people into fellowship, because they may be anything but a help to us when they are within.
Ques. Is the exposure here to others besides John?
F.E.R. Well, the Lord is speaking to them all, is He not?
Ques. Is it to John in verse 26?
F.E.R. Oh, I was thinking of "From henceforth I tell you", etc. The impression it gives me is this, that you must be prepared for it, that you cannot take everyone on trust. The Lord makes that known to you, and you are cast upon the Lord -- and you need to be cast on the Lord down here. You want to watch diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest there be any profane person like Esau.
Ques. You mean believers as well as the general world?
F.E.R. Oh, quite so. From henceforth He changes His attitude; I mean, He allowed Judas to be with them before, but now He says, "From henceforth I tell you before it come" -- speaking of Judas treachery.
Ques. Is there any moral connection between this and feet-washing?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. The thing is the exposure of the traitor. Later on it says, when Judas has gone out, "Now is the Son of man glorified". Judas does not come in in the latter part of the chapter.
Ques. Is it prophetic, would you think?
F.E.R. Well, it indicates the ground that the Lord would take from that time, "From henceforth". It indicates a change in the course of things, and those who were near Him would soon discover the need of it. Take, for example, the case of Simon Magus, and see how they were guarded in that case; they had perception to refuse him; he would have turned out a traitor if they had let him.
{266}
Ques. Did baptism let him in at all?
F.E.R. Yes; but he was detected then, he did not get the Holy Spirit. I suppose people have very little sense of the great interest which the Lord takes in what is passing down here. I think we have, after all, very poor confidence in our own position. We can talk about our "ground" and all that sort of thing, but virtually people have very little confidence in their own position. One has so little sense of the interest which the Lord takes in things down here; but the interests of the Lord are down here, and if that is the case it must be that the Lord has the keenest interest -- attaches the greatest importance to what passes down here.
Ques. Do you mean temporal things?
F.E.R. No, indeed; I do not think the Lord is occupied about temporal matters, the Father takes that in hand; but I think that the Lord has the keenest interest, if I might use the expression of Him, in all that is connected with His name down here, and in all that is connected with the saints too. And in that way I think the position of brethren is an extremely important one from a *moral* point of view. I think it is of the last importance.
Ques. As guarding what is due to Him?
F.E.R. That is it. I think if brethren were characterised by this, that they are in the full light of the testimony of God, that would be a spot of the deepest interest to Christ. And I think, too, that if there were dependence and confidence and all that sort of thing, we should be forewarned of what would otherwise become a source of trial to us.
Rem. That is why I mentioned its being prophetic; you would be really acquainted with the mind of God.
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. The Lord was speaking just to the little fragment of the disciples, but I think the interest of the Lord must be wherever you have, it may be, but a fragment of people in the light of
{267}
God's testimony. It is impossible to get beyond the light of God's testimony.
Ques. What is the force of the last half of verse 19, "that ... ye may believe that I am"?
F.E.R. I think that people would be discovered, and the discovery of them would really confirm the word of the Lord; they would confirm His premonition. I think you may be, in a certain sense, shy of a person who is even inside, watching him diligently lest he fail of the grace of God. You might get a profane person, and you must watch him diligently.
Ques. If there were progress in the divine nature, there would be no root of bitterness springing up?
F.E.R. No, there would not; but it is astonishing how much a man can take in naturally. If he is a profane person, he will treat the word of the Lord as a common thing -- that is what I understand by a profane person.
Ques. Was not Judas here a root of bitterness?
F.E.R. Yes, he was.
Ques. And might you not find a root of bitterness even in people you could not unchristianise?
F.E.R. Oh, quite so; but a person who fails of the grace of God could hardly be a Christian. So a Christian may, or may not, be a root of bitterness in a certain sense.
Ques. It is very strong in allusion to Judas?
F.E.R. Yes; he had no grace. Then I think what comes out afterwards confirms the greatness of the interest which the Lord has in things down here. "He that receiveth whomsoever I send, receiveth me". I feel pretty sure of what I said, that, in spite of all the assumption to "right ground" and all that sort of thing, brethren have had exceedingly little sense of their position from a moral point of view. You see, the assumption to "right ground" is after all only relative in regard to other people; it means that if we are on right ground, other people are on wrong ground,
{268}
but that is not the way I should look on things at all. We are really in the light of God's testimony, and the interest of the Lord is there. He has His eyes upon us, and His interest is there. I have no doubt that there may be plenty of Christian people in Popery, but how can the interest of the Lord be there? And it is much the same in the National Church. But here you have a little company really in the light of God's testimony, and the interest of the Lord must be there. His greatest interest must be there; and that is the importance to my mind of the position of brethren.
Ques. Could you perhaps make it a little simpler to us?
F.E.R. That is quite simple.
Ques. You must know what God's testimony is?
F.E.R. What I understand by God's testimony is the showing forth of His pleasure in Christ -- the expression of His pleasure in regard to man, and I am in the light of that testimony -- not only in the light of justification, but risen with Christ -- that is His mind. It is to be in the light of His testimony that I am risen with Christ, "through faith of the operation of God, who raised him from the dead". And that is the proper position of brethren, not simply that you are justified. They believe in justification in the Church of England, and remain just so many units; but the light of God's testimony is Christ *risen*, and the great point is to be in the full light of that testimony. That is God's mind; you are outside everything by the pleasure of God; you are outside every order of man down here. Now if you could have a company of people in the light of that, depend upon it the deepest interest of Christ would be with them, because they are associated with Him -- they are *risen* with Him. It may be true in God's mind as to every saint upon earth. God has not two minds about people, but a great many accept it up to the point of justification, but they do not accept His mind about
{269}
"risen with Christ". Do you think that is true?
Rem. Yes; and that is quite simple now. How could you tell about being "risen together with him" if you were in the Church of England?
Rem. For the light of God's testimony must you not have both Romans and Colossians?
F.E.R. No, I do not think so. Because in Romans you have Christ risen -- you get it all there. You see, the first step with regard to the believer is appropriated by *faith*, but with every other step it is only *apprehended* by faith. It is apprehended by faith, but it is not appropriated so. The first step is you are justified by faith, that is, "if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification" -- it is put in that way, and you appropriate it by faith. But with every other step you do not appropriate it, though you do apprehend it by faith. I believe *appropriation lies in the divine nature*; you apprehend things by faith, but you do not appropriate them so.
Ques. That is to say, that all faith does for you is, it enables you to apprehend God's mind?
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. You may have the setting forth of God's pleasure, but the way you appropriate it is by the work of God in you.
Ques. But you may have the apprehension of God's mind by faith?
F.E.R. Yes; but I think the apprehension and the appropriation must go together somehow. You really apprehend the thing when you are ready to appropriate it.
Ques. And the power of appropriation is affection?
F.E.R. Yes; love. If you had a company of people who were really in the full light of God's testimony down here, let them be as feeble as they may, is it not true that the deepest interest of the Lord
{270}
would be there? Then you get, "He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me".
Ques. They are to be companions of Christ now?
F.E.R. Yes. It is like as if Christ Himself came. "Receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me". Romans is light, that is the great object of it, it is the light of God's testimony in which you are to walk down here; and, as a man upon earth, you could never go beyond it. It is impossible that you should be beyond the full light of God's testimony down here -- it is absolutely impossible.
Rem. That testimony is complete by the testimony of Christ risen.
Ques. And when you come to the Colossians and the Ephesians you are not a man down here?
F.E.R. No; because you are quickened together with Him; you must understand this in Scripture, that you are outside yourself.
Ques. And God's testimony as you have it in Timothy is in Christ -- God's pleasure in Christ?
F.E.R. Well, quite so. I think the death and resurrection of Christ are both parts of God's testimony. The death of Christ is the showing forth of what God's love is; but He shows forth His pleasure in the resurrection of Christ. The death of Christ is the revelation of God, it is the commendation of His love, and His righteousness is seen there, and all that; but the showing forth of His pleasure is in the resurrection.
Ques. Everything is involved in the resurrection?
F.E.R. Yes; quite so. It is the great divine triumph, or rather the testimony of God's triumph, though the triumph was really in death. The power was really in death, though in resurrection you have the expression of it. But the power of it really was in death; He "death by dying slew". Every enemy was silenced by death, and resurrection was the testimony of it.
{271}
Ques. And glory must follow, because He had no place here as a risen Man?
F.E.R. No; I think there is a great opportunity before brethren at the present moment. The only thing is whether they have spiritual energy to avail themselves of it. Nobody else takes the trouble to do so.
Ques. What are other people doing?
F.E.R. Haggling over one thing or another, but certainly not concerning themselves about the pleasure of God. They know nothing about what it is to be in the light of God's testimony down here. They may claim to have a certain standing and that kind of rubbish, claiming what is official and formal, and all that, but the real thing is all left -- all that is really for the pleasure of God.
Now what follows is that Jesus was "troubled in spirit, and testified ... one of you shall betray me".
Ques. Does that refer to His feelings as a Man?
F.E.R. Oh, I think it was a very great deal more than that. "He was troubled in spirit", that was *Himself* who was troubled. Every sensibility was distressed. I do not think that anything is much more important than to see that every sensibility in the Lord sprang from what was divine. He had taken the place of man, but every sensibility had its origin in what was divine.
Ques. It is not referring to Judas action exactly?
F.E.R. You find that the Lord always anticipated everything that was troublous; you get that even in regard to the cross. He goes through the trouble before the trouble comes; so here, He goes through the trouble of it before the treachery comes, and when it came He was calm and prepared for it. It was a very strange thing, "one of you shall betray me" -- a man who had been three and a half years in the company of the Lord, and who had seen all that the
{272}
Lord was, and who yet, after all, could have the heart to become a traitor.
Ques. Is not the heart of man fully exposed in Judas?
Rem. His ruling principle is exposed.
F.E.R. Yes. In Peter's case, he did what he did under pressure, he got himself into a false position, and could not stand the pressure; but with Judas, it was more or less planned and deliberate.
Ques. Was it not a special mark of favour on the part of the Lord to give the sop to Judas?
F.E.R. Well, it was a very dreadful thing in a way, because it marked him out as a traitor.
Rem. Peter loved the Lord, but he was weak.
F.E.R. Yes; and I think the Lord can bear with weakness, but with Judas, as you say, it was the ruling principle of his heart that comes out, and the whole thing was more or less deliberate.
Rem. So that what little knowledge of Christ he had turned to his ruin.
F.E.R. Yes. I think it has been said that Judas had some sort of idea that the Lord would deliver Himself. This is very likely true, but then he did not understand the mind of God.
Rem. When Satan had put it into his heart to betray the Lord, then he encouraged it.
F.E.R. Yes; it was all moral progress; covetousness was there, and then the conception of the thing comes in, and then Satan enters into him.
Rem. If there had been any real knowledge of Christ, he would not have allowed the thing.
F.E.R. No; he would not have allowed the thought; but you see he never judged his covetousness, his ruling principle was never broken. I think J.N.D. makes the remark that, dreadful as was the thing that came out, the disciples never doubted the word of the Lord, "One of you shall betray me" -- it only became a question who should do it.
{273}
Rem. Faith is there, there is the mark of the work of God in them.
F.E.R. Yes; "after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly"; it is not Judas the Lord addressed then, it is Satan, I take it.
Ques. But they understood it to mean Judas?
F.E.R. I do not know at all, but the moment Satan entered into him, he was no longer Judas to the Lord, he was Satan. As He says to Peter, you know, "Get thee behind me, Satan".
Then comes out a remarkable statement -- "Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him" -- and the remainder of the chapter puts the disciples in that light, They were the disciples of Christ if they had love one to another, "as I have loved you". I think that proves that they were to be the continuation of Him down here, "as I have loved you".
Rem. It is a wonderful circle of glory that you get in these two or three verses.
F.E.R. Yes; hitherto it had been a question of the disciples, and Judas and the traitor, and all that sort of thing, but from here onward He looks at things in quite another light. Judas is exposed now, and the Lord looks at things from another standpoint -- it is "the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him".
Ques. And He looks at them from that standpoint?
F.E.R. Yes; quite so. Everything contributes to the glory of God, and to the working out of His counsels; not a single thing but contributes to the accomplishment of His purposes in all that transpires down here, and to the working out of His glory. "Being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God". You see the Gentiles are brought in, but they do not continue in the goodness of the
{274}
Lord; and they too are broken off, and the Jew is brought in again.
Rem. And when the first man is set aside, the second Man is brought in.
F.E.R. Yes; and it is difficult to see how the Lord could bring in the second Man unless the first man had been set aside. That, I think, is the wonderful thing, that really God brings in the second Man where the first man had been, in the very place of the first man -- that is in you and in me.
Ques. If there had been no sin, could there have been His glory, as we understand it?
F.E.R. Well, you know, that is so very hypothetical. It is much more easy to deal with the positive side of revelation. It is a fact beyond all manner of question, that sin has become the occasion of God revealing Himself.
Rem. What I was thinking was that the divine nature would have been there, but not perhaps the glory.
F.E.R. The glory of God would have been here apart from that, because the glory of God is in the accomplishing of His purposes; His purposes are eternal.
Ques. In what way is the Son of man glorified?
F.E.R. I think that it was a remarkable thing that the Son of man should, in that way, be entrusted to secure the glory of God. It is remarkable that it should be given to Man, the seed of the woman, to secure His glory; but it is all perfectly simple if you see that the Son of man is the Son of God. If you look at the Lord in that light, under that name, it is a remarkable thing that God should be glorified in man. And He Himself is glorified in its being entrusted to the Son of man to maintain the glory of God.
Rem. It was man who called the glory of God in question, and now it is in the Son of man that God is glorified.
{275}
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. Is not His glory redemption?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. "Now is the Son of man glorified" -- it is a wonderful contradiction of the human thought. It was in the cross that every attribute of God was expressed and in a Man; I think it is a point of the last moment to see that the Lord was here in that condition as a Man, and was always true to it; every attribute of God -- all that God was -- was vindicated and expressed, whatever it was.
Rem. Exactly the opposite of what man was at the first?
F.E.R. Yes. On the other hand, He emptied Himself. The great point in that passage is that it was not simply the outward act, but there was a corresponding mind there. He made nothing of Himself; there was an act of mind that accompanied what was outward. "I come to do thy will, O God". There was the corresponding act of mind. In fact, I should suppose the act of mind really preceded the outward act. He came with the full knowledge of all that lay before Him. He accepted it. "I come to do thy will, O God".
Rem. And all those expressions are used of Him, "Thou hast hated iniquity", etc.
F.E.R. Everything that God is going to display has first to come out in the way of testimony. So the throne of God will really be based on "Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity", but then it all had first to come out in testimony in Him. It is in that way the Lord is glorified. I do not think that God would have been glorified in the same way in the mere repression of evil, but lawlessness has been hated and righteousness loved to the glory of God, and all has been maintained in a Man down here. And that is the basis of the throne.
{276}
Ques. And that has been done in the face of all the opposition?
F.E.R. Yes; in the face of all the power of the enemy. The point is that the triumph must be moral.
Ques. How do you understand the expression, "God shall also glorify him in himself"?
F.E.R. It is the present place of the Son of man; His rights are in abeyance. Nothing is displayed yet, you know.
Ques. Does not that connect itself with the next expression, "and shall straightway glorify him"? I always feel that that is a passage I cannot bottom.
F.E.R. Well, I do not know that I can either. It was provisional in that sense. He must have glory as the answer to what He was in the place of deepest humiliation. He must have glory; but it is not yet public glory.
Ques. How could the Son of man be glorified in God?
F.E.R. Well, the only possible clue to it is that He is divine.
Rem. Like that passage in chapter 17, "Glorify thou me ... with the glory which I had with thee before the world was"?
F.E.R. Quite so. And "if" in Scripture raises the necessary moral consequence. "If God be glorified in him" the necessary moral consequence is, "God shall also glorify him in himself".
Rem. No creature could ask for glory with Him.
F.E.R. No; it would be the greatest piece of presumption.
Rem. It is in Him as Son of man, but it could not be unless He were the Son of God.
F.E.R. The Lord speaks of Himself under an official name or title. He does that very commonly. But many people in this world are spoken of in their official names; you may speak of the Queen, for instance.
{277}
Rem. Anyone who was less than divine could not have done the work He did.
F.E.R. No; I think the bearing of the title "Son of man" is the complete subjugation of all evil.
CHAPTER 14
Ques. The beginning of this chapter is evidently connected with the previous one; but what would you say is the import of the chapter?
F.E.R. I think that, in the previous one, the Lord brings before them what they will have to meet in the world, but the object of this chapter is to take them out of the world. As men they would have to meet a great many things in this world, trials, and evil, and all that sort of thing, but the Lord's object is to take them out of the world. His object is not exactly to give you relief from the things that trouble you; relief may or may not come, but His way is to lead you out of the world. You often find people who become opposed to the light, and the Lord allows them to go on, and often even to a very advanced age; you are surprised at it, for they do not exactly do any good, and yet the Lord leaves them here. You have to meet this and all kinds of things, such as you get in chapter 13, treachery and faithlessness, and so on, but at the same time the Lord knows all about it. He Himself has had to meet it, and the object of this chapter is to take you out of this world; that is, of course, in mind and spirit. You are indoors in this chapter, in with the Lord, and outside the world. The sympathy of the Lord leads you out. He makes you conscious that He has been into the circumstances and everything down here, and He knows all about things down here, but the effect of His sympathy is to carry your hearts out of it, to carry you, in thought and spirit, to where He is. There is no trouble where Christ is, all the trouble is down here. For instance,
{278}
if you come to the throne of grace, you come to where there is no trouble at all. Down here you might have to meet a very great deal of trouble.
Rem. And contact with the throne of grace would enable you to meet the trouble.
F.E.R. Yes. I think so. When you come to the grace of Christ you are out of all the trouble. It is a great thing to know that there is a place to which you can go where there is no trouble. It is not that Christ has come in to modify things here, but the power of Christianity is that it leads you out of all that is here. Power has come in adequate for it, sufficient for it, and then it is that you can come back to the things here in an entirely different spirit.
Ques. Is that what you get in chapters 15 and 16?
F.E.R. Well, when you come to those chapters, it is not a question of yourself at all, you come out for Christ; there you come to fruit-bearing, and so on, you are entirely for Christ, you have done with yourself.
Rem. You could not have done that unless you had had all those questions as to your own need settled?
F.E.R. No; but the practical effect of chapter 13 is to fit you for this. "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me" -- that shows you the indispensable necessity for the feet-washing.
Ques. I suppose that verse 3, "where I am, there ye may be also" has a present application?
F.E.R. Yes; you can be there. Paul speaks of the same thing practically. He speaks of the "exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward", but when John speaks of it he says, "I will come again, and receive you unto myself". John presents the Person, Paul the power. "The exceeding greatness of his power" is really exercised to put us there; that is, it is that we might be in the enjoyment of the hope of our calling. John presents things in another light,
{279}
"I will come again, and receive you unto myself".
Ques. Is it collective from chapter 13 onward?
F.E.R. It is leading on to what is collective, it is with a view to that company. The idea is not that the disciples were so many units, but they had not yet the light of the company. As far as I understand the gospel, everything down to the end of chapter 6 is individual; then in chapters 7 - 12 you get the one flock and the one Shepherd, and the Lord drawing all to Himself, and the idea of the company coming into view; then in the latter part (chapters 14 - 16) you get the company there in testimony.
Rem. Even in chapter 13 we have, "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another".
F.E.R. Yes; the testimony was in the company, and the thought there is not merely love to one another, but to *Him* in that act.
Rem. They had been so in *His* company that they loved one another?
F.E.R. Yes; they bore the impress of Christ. All the truth of God's testimony resides in the church. You take Christendom, what amount of love do you really see there? And yet Christendom in that way holds the place of "pillar and ground of the truth". But if the heathen were to look at Christendom, what could they see in it? The light is almost entirely hidden, you can scarcely detect it. Love is a sort of quality which is scarcely to be found; you would have to look very closely and particularly to discover the least bit of it, you would certainly have to use a microscope of very great power to discover it.
Ques. Is not feet-washing in view of the company and our being put there?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so; and then there is another thing, that company was to be the recipient of the Spirit.
{280}
Ques. Is not that the ground you would take to put you above things here -- the Spirit?
F.E.R. Yes; but then I think that even antecedent to that it is very important to know your calling and place as outside this world altogether.
Ques. And you get that in the beginning of the chapter?
F.E.R. Yes; it is exactly the same in the opening of the Ephesians -- it is really to give them the sense that they have a place in heaven; that is the great point in chapter 1, not merely that they should know of the place in heaven, but that there is power to put them into a condition for it. That power is towards them, they have a place in heaven according to the eternal purpose of God; that is what you get in the opening of @Ephesians 1 -- "who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ", and then what comes out in the close of the chapter is, the power of God that is toward the saints to put them in a condition for that place -- the power that wrought in Christ, raising Him from the dead. You are not yet in the place, but there is the power for you that can put you in a condition for the place.
Ques. And *now*?
F.E.R. Yes flesh and blood cannot inherit, but there is a power shown in raising Christ from the dead which can really put you in that place.
Ques. Not yet actually in the condition, but in the place?
F.E.R. Yes, spiritually; but you are not actually in the place yet. When you come to chapter 2 it is not the *power* of God; the power of God is in chapter 1, but I do not see the power of God in chapter 2 -- it is His work there. The close of chapter 1 speaks of the "exceeding greatness of his power ... which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead". Spiritually we are quickened together with Christ -- that is all His work, that we are quickened
{281}
spiritually, that is the effect of His work, not His power. It is His power that raised Christ from the dead and which can beget in you an actual state or condition suited to being in heaven. His power is to put you into the hope of the calling, and into the enjoyment of the inheritance. When He brings to pass a condition suited to heaven, you will come into it in a moment; but the power for that change is towards you, it is the power that wrought in Christ when He raised Him from the dead -- that is the power that is towards the saints.
Ques. What about chapter 3?
F.E.R. Chapter 3 is that state in which you are able to come out for Him here; it is not a question there of state for heaven, but that you might come out here for Him. The great point in chapter 3 is that you might be "filled to all the fulness of God" -- morally representative of God down here.
Ques. Would it be the same power as is spoken of in @Philippians 3, "the power of his resurrection"?
F.E.R. Yes; I think so. The prayer in @Ephesians 1 is that you might know it, be conscious of it -- I think the word is: "That ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead". Of course it is perfectly true that it speaks of power in another sense, it is His power that works in you, "to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think", but in chapter 1 His power is *towards* us, not *in* us. In chapter 2 it is what God has effected, you are "quickened together with Christ" -- and so, too, in Colossians, it is viewed as effected. I think you have to distinguish between the power of God towards you, and the work of God in you; it confused me a bit once.
{282}
Ques. It is a power towards you which will eventually put you in all God's purposes?
F.E.R. Yes; you get three things in chapter 1, the hope of His calling, the riches of His inheritance in the saints, and then the power of God that can put you into it. I think it is more exactly the power that brings about a condition that can put you into it, that is the resurrection condition. It is in chapter 2 that the apostle really speaks of what is effected in them; it is not a question so much there of power, but quickening together with Christ -- that is all spiritual, you know.
Ques. Can you say a word as to "risen with Christ", and "raised up together, and made us sit together"?
F.E.R. It is Jew and Gentile that are raised up together, it ended all distinction between Jew and Gentile; they are made to sit together in the heavenlies, God has given them a seat there. It is beautiful to me to see the difference between John and Paul; Paul speaks about the exceeding greatness of God's power, while John presents the Person, "I will come again, and receive you unto myself".
Rem. "We shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is".
F.E.R. Yes; it is the Person, "We shall see him as he is". You cannot do without John; a man who is continually harping on Paul's teaching would be defective.
Ques. Is it that there is more affection in John than in Paul?
F.E.R. Well, I would not quite like to say that; John has his own peculiarities.
Ques. But he bears more on that side?
F.E.R. Yes; I think we have seen, have we not, the defect of a man who is wholly taken up with Paul? What I think is that no one man was capable of being the vessel of all the truth. You do get everything in the Lord, and that is to me the value of the gospels --
{283}
He was complete, but you could not get all the truth brought out in one man.
Rem. And it must be in men who were specially acquainted with the Lord.
F.E.R. Yes; and those specially conversant with the Lord's affections.
Ques. Do you not find that usually the young Christian is more attracted to John than to Paul?
F.E.R. Yes; but, you know, it is only within the last five or six years that we have been awakened to that, that John's presentation of eternal life is objective.
Rem. And yet the study of John was J.N.D.s legacy to us.
F.E.R. Yes; and J.N.D. himself had stated the same thing almost in the same words; he spoke of "the out-of-the-world, heavenly condition and order of things in which eternal life consists" -- it shows where his mind was; and he wrote that twenty-five years before. If it is a condition of being, it is evidently objective.
Rem. "Let not your heart be troubled". I suppose that would be in connection with the troubles of the company?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so; it has reference to what had come before them in the previous chapter.
Rem. They were not to lose heart.
F.E.R. No.
Rem. They had reason to distrust their own hearts after what had come out.
F.E.R. Yes; it is a most painful thing that you cannot be certain of any heart in the world; the only heart you can be certain about is Christ's, and, you know, I think it greatly helps you to trust other people if you trust Christ. Just as the apostle said to the Galatians, "I have confidence as to you in the Lord" -- you can have confidence in people in that way, but if you trust people just because they are people, you will find them break down some day. I am sure
{284}
that the disciples must have felt that, with the treachery of Judas, and the weakness of Peter, there was nothing among themselves that was any refuge for them.
Rem. Christ was the One on whom the whole structure of God's purposes rested, and He was to be a stay to their hearts.
Ques. Is not that the idea in "Now is the Son of man glorified"?
F.E.R. It says in the previous chapter, "Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands" -- the whole of God's purposes rested on Him, He came from God and went to God; you must take all that in if you want to understand this chapter. Now supposing that the Lord had not gone on, and been steadfast, supposing He had left His teaching only -- like a system of ethics -- where would Christianity have been? What could it have been if the Lord had just retired to heaven?
Ques. I suppose that in verse 1 He Himself is brought in as an object of faith; they had believed in God, but now there is a Person revealed as an object of faith?
F.E.R. Yes; but I do not think it is quite the idea of faith in a Person; a pious Jew might, I suppose, have said he believed in God; but now God was presented in a way personally. Of course there was a kind of personal idea connected with Jehovah, but a Jew will never know Jehovah save in Christ. I do not think you can speak of Christ being seated "on Jehovah's throne" -- it is not quite just. He is seated on the Father's throne; I should not like to sing it myself.
Rem. I have always sung it with reserve. A Jew will only know Jehovah in Christ. But would you not say that whenever Jehovah is spoken of it refers to Christ?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so; Jehovah is presented in Christ. If you talk about "The Almighty" that is
{285}
not exactly a Person; "The Almighty" presents to us God, but all the Trinity is included, in that sense; it is an attribute of the Godhead, but is what it presents to us.
Ques. Does not Christ take that title in the Revelation?
F.E.R. Yes, He does, "The Almighty".
Ques. You said just now that this chapter takes us outside?
F.E.R. Well, the first great thing is to know that you have a place somewhere else. If a man is going to be outside of this world, then he must first get to know that he has a place somewhere else. If a man were pursuing a business in England, but had his family and all his belongings in Canada, my own impression is that that man's heart would be in Canada. He might remain in England for the sake of his business, but his heart would not be in England if all his belongings were in Canada. I do not know how far we have got hold of a "place"; I do not know how far I have yet done with the earth. "I go to prepare a place for you" -- then in Ephesians and Colossians you have got the "hope of his calling" -- and that is a place. I feel sure that the "place" needs to assume more prominence with us; I think J.B.S. pressed that. Then, I think, the very fact of having a place there would lead to our refusing a place here.
Rem. The Person is not here.
F.E.R. No; the teaching in this chapter goes exactly with @Ephesians 1.
Rem. In spirit, you mean, we have got to the place now?
F.E.R. Yes; the very sense of our seat being there, and all our belongings and associations there, would practically deliver us from the idea of a place here. You often see that if you get mercies and all that kind of thing, they are very apt to attach you to
{286}
the place where they are. Now I think the great point of Christ being in heaven -- of a place in heaven -- is to attach you to the place where He is, in order to detach you from the place here. All your relations being with the saints, with those who belong to that place, you are in affection out of this place, and you are getting a foretaste of the place that is above; that is the true power of the assembly.
Rem. If we had better known Him that is from the beginning, we should be more detached from things here. A man naturally might find the world stripped of its happiness for him, but that would not be sufficient to detach his heart from it, he must have an object outside of it.
F.E.R. Yes.
Rem. "Whither I go ye know, and the way ye know".
F.E.R. He was not communicating strange things to them, but things with which, in principle, they were perfectly familiar.
Ques. Was the way through death?
F.E.R. Well, I think it is more that *Himself* is the way; "I am the way, the truth, and the life". You will not touch it if you do not understand what is presented to us in Christ -- all the testimony that is presented to us in Him. If you do not understand God's approach to us, you cannot understand our approach to God. That was the great defect with the children of Israel, they were brought into the land of promise, but without the knowledge of God. In the future they will be brought into the land with the new covenant written in their hearts, one term of which is, "They shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest". They will all be brought into the land with the knowledge of God.
Ques. And if we are brought into this place it is with the knowledge of Christ?
F.E.R. Yes; He has presented God to us. He
{287}
had presented to them the Father. "I am the way, the truth, and the life". You cannot come to the Father except by Him; it is only by Him that we get the knowledge of the Father.
Ques. And the Father is distinctly a personal name?
F.E.R. Oh, undoubtedly. "No man cometh unto the Father, but by me"; then He goes on to say, "And from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him".
Ques. Why did not the Israelites know God?
F.E.R. I think it was because there was no work of God in them; they must have been born again for that -- to have the knowledge of God. When they come in again in the future they will have the new covenant written in their hearts, and clean water will be sprinkled over them. They soon became idolatrous the first time.
Ques. Do you not think we know more of the work of God for us, than in us?
F.E.R. Well, they must have had some kind of remembrance of Egypt, and of their deliverance from it, but that is not the knowledge of God.
Rem. You would distinguish between Moses and them?
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. They are addressed as the house of Israel in @Acts 7, when Stephen says, "Ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them". But I think it is evident in the history of Moses that he knew God. Think of "I beseech thee, show me thy glory" -- it is a beautiful expression on the part of Moses.
Ques. And does He not show it to him?
F.E.R. Yes.
Rem. I suppose the sum and substance of all this is that He has gone to the Father, but he that had seen Him had seen the Father also?
{288}
F.E.R. Yes; everything is bound up there, "I am the way, the truth, and the life" -- God has come out. It is like the "new and living way" -- you have boldness to enter the holiest. I think that is because God has come out; you could not go in if God had not come out. If the veil had not been rent from top to bottom, you could not go in. For a man to have gone into the holiest of all it would have been death. You could not enter into what was unknown, but only into what is made known. The Lord had brought all to them, "I am the way, the truth, and the life". He brought everything to them in His own Person.
Ques. "If it were not so, I would have told you". What is that?
F.E.R. I do not know that I have any other thought about it than this, how completely frank the Lord was to them; He would not conceal anything at all from them. The greatest mark of affection is confidence -- do you not think so? I do not think confidence belongs to faith but to affection. You will never confide in a person if you do not love that person. Love begets confidence.
Ques. How would you say the affections are formed in this chapter -- by the Spirit?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. He says, "at that day".
Rem. And that is the Spirit's day?
F.E.R. Yes. If they had the Spirit of truth, they would go on pretty fast in the apprehension of the truth. Everything being clear in a certain sense, if a man has the Spirit of truth, he must make great advance in the things of truth. Therefore if there were no hindrances, one who has the Spirit of truth ought to make the most rapid advance in the truth.
Rem. It is distinctly said of the babes, "Ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things".
F.E.R. Exactly; I think that we sometimes take all these things as expressions of the Lord when on
{289}
earth, but they are just as much the expressions of the Lord now that He is in heaven. I think we often get to look at the Lord as a very beautiful picture upon the earth, but then He is exactly the same in heaven. The Lord is just as tender as ever He was when on earth, and He will say exactly the same words in heaven as when on earth. He is not a bit different in heaven from what He was when upon earth. He would say, "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest", just in the same way there as here. I do not think that any thoughtful person could think, for an instant, that there could be any difference in Christ, though, of course, if you want to know what the heart of Christ is you must learn it as it came out down here.
Ques. As a matter of fact the whole record of what Christ did and said is written in the light of resurrection?
F.E.R. Yes. It was the Lord Himself who began to speak of the great salvation, it came out in principle by Christ; it was not that He brought out one thing, and the apostles another. I think people have sometimes set the teaching of the apostles in contrast to Christ, but they brought out nothing afterwards in testimony that had not, in principle, already come out in Christ. Of course, it could not come out plainly, but in principle everything that they brought out had come out first in Christ, in His testimony, by His word.
Rem. I think that makes the gospels very interesting.
F.E.R. Yes. It is not an original thought of mine at all, but I never got hold of the gospels at all until I heard that. "For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might undo the works of the devil". He began to undo the works of the devil when here upon earth. I will tell you how the devil's works are undone. If you bring *God* close to man in testimony, I defy any man, in the light of God's testimony, to go on with the world. You may say, "But a man
{290}
may get dark" -- still, I defy any man who is in the light of God's testimony to go on with the world. If he does, it is a proof to me that that man has never really been in the light. The world is a great system of which Satan is the god and prince, but "the Son of God has been manifested, that he might undo the works of the devil".
Ques. Would you not say that a man who has been in it could get out of it?
F.E.R. I doubt it very much, though I think that a man might have known a good bit intellectually without being in it.
Rem. "By every word of God" shall man live.
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. The word of God is the testimony of God, it is the real, living power of God. You know it is said that when a man in the world is greatly intent upon some particular line of things, that man will not care much about the details of his existence down here, about his bread and butter, for instance. Well, the testimony of God is far greater than anything of that kind, and I do not think that a man in the light of that ought to care very much about his food here. "By every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live". "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness". You are not to go and worry yourself about the bread that perisheth if you are intent upon God's kingdom. I think it is pretty evident here that the disciples had a very poor idea of what the Lord was presenting to them. I think they were true to Him, and they felt really drawn to Him. They had come to Him, and they believed in Him, but they had a very poor idea of what Christ had presented to them. He presented the Father to them -- "Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip?"
Ques. Were they not in the position of knowing the Saviour, but not going on to know the Father, like so many Christians today?
{291}
F.E.R. Yes; they only know Him by name. The name is maintained, but in Christendom generally there is exceedingly little acquaintance with the Father. I think the bulk of people look upon the Father as the Judge, and upon Christ as the One who makes propitiation for them; but the generality of Christians have no idea of counsels as connected with the Father.
Rem. I believe that one of the thirty-nine articles is to the effect that you must believe that Christ died to reconcile the Father to us.
F.E.R. Yes; the bulk of Christians do not enter into it; they connect Christ and love, but as to the Father they simply think they are heard with Him for Christ's sake. They do not know that the Father Himself is revealed in Christ.
Ques. Is not the Son of God manifested in connection with the Father?
F.E.R. Yes; the Father sent the Son that He might be the Saviour of the world; it was not only that the Son came, it was the Father sent Him.
Rem. I suppose you would say the revelation of the Father could have little meaning to us unless the Son had been here?
F.E.R. No; it never could have come out otherwise. The presence of the Son here, so that they could say, "That which we have seen and heard", gives it a character and reality that never could have been conveyed by mere words. But all that we have is recorded by eye-witnesses. God has taken care, and it is wonderful the care that He has taken, that there should be ample testimony to Christ, not simply an adequate record, but abundant testimony to Christ Himself. Take the resurrection -- and the testimony all hangs on the resurrection -- Christianity was formed on the testimony of the resurrection, and that, too, when the Person who was raised, and all the circumstances of it, were still fresh in the minds of the people.
{292}
Well, look what abundant care God took that man should be cognisant of His resurrection; the Lord lived here forty days upon earth, and was seen, time after time, by different people. Suppose a man told me that he did not believe in resurrection at all, why, the Old Testament scriptures bear ample testimony to it, and here you have the witness of such as Peter and John and Paul; am I to set more importance on what you tell me, than on the witness of Peter and John and Paul, in things of which they knew a great deal better than you? I was only thinking how the grace of God is magnified by His putting the resurrection of Christ as the foundation of everything. Everything in the way of testimony has been placed fully within the cognisance of man, as, for example, His being seen of five hundred brethren at once. You may depend upon it the resurrection is the crux, there is nothing like the resurrection; it is the real ground of conflict, everything is admitted if the resurrection is admitted. You cannot gainsay anything if you believe in the resurrection.
Ques. But would you not think that there are vast numbers of persons who do not believe in it?
F.E.R. Yes, there are; but that is exactly because they are not acquainted with the testimony of God. Let the resurrection go, and all is gone, but hold to the resurrection, and you have all -- the whole fabric stands.
Rem. The resurrection is really the victory?
F.E.R. Yes; it is the glory of God; the resurrection of Christ is the expression of God's pleasure, while His death is the expression of God's love. If God could not raise a man from death to life, justification would simply be a dead letter, it could have no meaning. The resurrection is, therefore, the testimony to justification, and there could be no justification if it were not in God's power to raise man from death to life. If God is going to give a testimony to His
{293}
ability to justify, it must be that He can raise the man out of death, because man is under death. His power is the testimony to His attitude, and His attitude is to justify. The expression of His power in the resurrection of Christ is that which evidences His attitude. It would be futile for Him to be in that attitude unless He could raise a man from death. What would be the use of clearing a man from his sins, and yet not from the penalty of those sins? The testimony of resurrection was really necessary to vouch for the truth of His attitude.
Rem. "Whether is easier to say?"
F.E.R. Well, quite so; it is the principle, "Rise, take up thy bed and walk". I have no courage in that way, but if I had to do with infidel people, I should hang everything on the resurrection. Detail, and all that, is really not worth telling about, you must hang all on the resurrection.
Ques. Justification really puts you on resurrection ground?
F.E.R. Yes, it does; but the point is this, you are brought into contact with Christ as Lord, and that puts you outside of all that is here. You are justified from all those things, from which you could not be justified by the law.
Ques. I suppose there would be something different and special about a "commandment" in distinction to "words", would you say?
F.E.R. What do you understand by commandments?
Rem. I am not very clear about it.
F.E.R. There is a remarkable instance of a commandment in the close of chapter 12, "The Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak", etc.; the character and force of the Father's commandment was life eternal.
{294}
Ques. Would that be the force of a commandment here?
F.E.R. Well, a commandment, in John's idea of it, is an expression of the Father's will; any expression of the Father's will was a commandment to Christ; and so too with us, any expression, any word of Christ, has the force of a commandment to us.
Rem. Laying down His life was a commandment from the Father.
F.E.R. Yes; and I think, too, there is one great point about a commandment, that the Lord never enjoins upon them anything which has not been first seen in Himself; and commandments assume a very different character when they come from Christ from those that came from Mount Sinai. The latter show what a man ought to be, but they did not express *what God was*.
Ques. What would you say is the difference between keeping His commandments and His word?
F.E.R. His word was His testimony. I rather fancy that His word is the revelation of the Father, but the commandments were the expression of the Father's will. I think you are compelled to distinguish the one from the other. Christ revealed the Father, but He made known, too, His pleasure; and you have to distinguish between the Person and His pleasure. Now the cross is the revelation of God, but the resurrection speaks of His pleasure. You see Himself in the cross, but His pleasure comes out in the resurrection. It is most interesting to see that the veil of the temple is rent in twain from the top to the bottom when Christ *died*, not when He was *raised*. The resurrection sets forth God's pleasure.
Ques. Would "keeping his commandments" mean that you treasure them, value them?
F.E.R. "He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me". I think you not only *cherish* them, but they are effective with you.
{295}
You can scarcely speak of keeping His commandments if they had no effect upon you -- they are the foundation of your practice. I think that is the great point in the maintenance of the truth; you may put the truth into creeds and formulas, but they are all ineffective -- the truth is not kept in that way. The truth is maintained in that it gives character to the saints, it is effective in that way. The fact is this, if it had not been for vitality in Christians, the word of God would have been a dead letter; the truth is maintained by the power of the Holy Spirit in the saints. In no other way would the truth have been maintained.
Rem. You could not put living things into moulds.
F.E.R. No; the word of God is living, but, as I have said sometimes, it is only living when in connection with a soul; apart from that the word of God would be a dead letter.
Ques. It was so in the dark ages, was it not?
F.E.R. Yes; but even there a certain amount of vitality was maintained in connection with the saints. I do not see how the truth could be anything but a dead letter apart from the Spirit's work in people; creeds and formulas are totally ineffective. You see that coming out in 2 Timothy through the apostle, "The same commit thou to *faithful* men who shall be able to teach others also" -- you really want the faithful men: it is in that kind of line that the truth is really maintained. Of course you have the Scriptures as the limit of truth, they form the limit and standard of the truth you have, and whatever light it may please God to give you, you are always bounded by Scripture, you cannot transgress that, you cannot go outside that.
Ques. Verses 21 and 22 are individual, are they not, though what you have afterwards is all collective?
F.E.R. Yes; the spirit of John is collective, the spirit of his teaching, but wherever you have testing coming in, it is always in connection with the individual.
{296}
It is remarkable how very often the pronouns are emphatic in this passage.
Ques. What is the difference between "dwelleth with you" and "shall be in you"? Is the latter collective?
F.E.R. No; I think that would be more "dwelleth *with* you". I think that when it speaks of His being in you, He may be in a very great number, but then He is in *every one* of them. "He continues with you, and shall be in you" -- that is the force of it.
Ques. It is that He does not go away?
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. And that is the thought in verse 16, "abide with you for ever"?
F.E.R. Well, I think it is in contrast really to Himself going away; and I do not think -- I cannot conceive but that the Spirit will be in the church for ever; I do not think that the church will ever lose the Spirit, I have never had that idea.
Ques. You mean He will indwell the church eternally?
F.E.R. Yes, I should say so. You see, everything subjectively in the church is in the power of the Spirit, and I think that if you come to take into account the place that the church gets, you will see that it must always be maintained in the power of the Spirit. In fact, it is the indwelling of the Holy Spirit that marks the special place of the church; I do not think that any other company is indwelt in that way. The unity of the Father and the Son, as I understand it, is really in the Spirit, though one does not care to speak much about it; the Spirit is spoken of as proceeding from the Father, but then He comes as sent of the Son. If the church is brought into such a place in connection with Christ, it is "by the Spirit all-pervading". If it is to be brought into such a place -- I mean as "his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all", it is inconceivable to me that it could be so except by the
{297}
all-pervading power of the Spirit. Every one in the body participates in that one Spirit. It is only one Spirit that baptises the whole body. Here I think the Lord is speaking of Him in contrast to Himself.
Ques. Is it His coming as the seal?
F.E.R. I think "continues with you" is in contrast to Himself. "He shall be in you" -- not simply *upon* them, but *in* them. You see, you get the baptism of the Holy Spirit, but that is not exactly the indwelling of the Holy Spirit; I do not see that the baptism of the Holy Spirit might not take place again.
Ques. You mean in regard to Israel, not again in regard to the church?
F.E.R. No.
Rem. I do not quite catch what you say as to the baptism of the Holy Spirit in regard to Israel.
F.E.R. "Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptiseth with the Holy Spirit". I take it that Israel will be baptised with the Holy Spirit.
Rem. It certainly seems that the *indwelling* of the Spirit is what marks the church now, and I can quite see that it is not likely to terminate when the church is taken out of the scene.
F.E.R. Well, the *formative* work of the Spirit will hardly go on then, but there will be the Spirit pervading all. I take it the Spirit will pervade everything, and give character to all. There will still be the unction, you could not have union else. Just as the unity between the Father and the Son is in the Spirit, so union between Christ and the saints must be in the Spirit.
Rem. If we are to be brought into the place of God's Son, it is by the Spirit of God's Son.
F.E.R. Yes, that is another point.
Ques. Why is it here the Spirit of truth?
F.E.R. It is in contrast to the letter of the truth: all Old Testament saints had the letter of truth, but
{298}
what marks the present time is the Spirit of truth. The important point is this, that saints are really taught from what is within, not from without. I do not think sufficient account has been taken of that. It is what John presses so much in his epistle. "Ye have not need that any one should teach you", it is the anointing that teaches you, you are taught from within. The word brings you the light of the truth, and then the Spirit comes as the seal, and then, after that, you are taught by the anointing, but you have the word as a limit. You do not really understand the word except by the Spirit. You notice how very rarely a man is converted through reading the Bible simply. I should suppose that nine hundred and ninety-nine out of a thousand do not get light directly from the scripture, but through the preacher. You see, a man gets exercised, and then he comes to the scripture to get enlightened. The great use of Scripture to a soul is to teach him what God has wrought. A man is converted but he does not know what it means, and so he comes to Scripture to get light as to what God has done. Every advance which a man makes in light is preceded by the work of the Spirit. In fact, a man gets no light at all except as it is preceded by a work of the Spirit of God in him. Of course, if a man goes to make a statement to others, he can only refer them to the word of God -- he would have no authority but the Scriptures. It would not do for him to make out that he is taught from within. And that really shows the immense importance of the Scriptures.
Ques. But to preach he must be taught of God?
F.E.R. Yes; he will not produce much effect without the teaching from within.
Rem. But that is not his authority.
F.E.R. No; you must have external authority. I know everything in the word was a dead letter to me except for the Spirit's teaching in me -- you know that yourself.
{299}
Rem. And that, I suppose, would explain how the great men who study textual criticism all their lives are yet often infidel.
F.E.R. Yes; to them it is just history mixed up with a certain amount of myth, and they are clever enough to go through it, and to distinguish between the history and the myth; they have no idea but that what is a myth to them should be so to you, they have no idea that you could be beyond them, with all their research and that sort of thing. It is a myth because they say so. Supposing that a man assumes, as they do, that there can be nothing in this world but what can be explained by natural causes, nothing spiritual, then Scripture must be to that man a myth; the point to him is that it is an absolute impossibility that there should be that in this world which is supernatural.
Rem. The conversion of Saul was distinctly supernatural.
F.E.R. Yes; and so is the conversion of any one of us, it is very supernatural.
Rem. I suppose the Spirit of truth is a Person, as we speak?
F.E.R. Yes. You see, the Spirit is the truth, you get that statement in the epistle, and it does not matter what truth one has to do with, He is the Spirit of it. Take sonship, He is the Spirit of sonship, and so you might take any truth, and the Spirit is the Spirit of it. The Spirit is life, and then, too, it is, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come" -- that is in connection with the coming of the Lord, and so with every truth in the same way, the Spirit is the Spirit of it.
Rem. The practical difficulty lies in this, that everything is made of what is outward, but the moment you come to speak of the Spirit of truth, that is received in quite a different way.
F.E.R. Yes; the illusion is this, that many people think that they are born again by the preaching, and
{300}
the consequence is that everything they get they get from without.
Ques. What is the force of being born again by the word?
F.E.R. Well, you can only count converts by their profession of faith, and so you can only tell people outwardly by their profession of the gospel. Even the apostle speaks of some being his children by the gospel. He says, "I have begotten you"; no one would think of supposing that they were born again by the apostle. I do not think that presents any real difficulty, because whoever is converted must be the fruit of the gospel, and born of the word of God, as to their public confession in the world.
Ques. But as to what is done in themselves, is not that by the word of God, "the incorruptible word of God"?
F.E.R. Well, in that case they were Christians, but that is a different idea from new birth.
Rem. I think that is the difficulty to many minds, they make new birth equivalent to being born again.
F.E.R. Yes; they have taken up what was said to Israel, and have confounded it with what you get in the epistles; but if you want to know the meaning of these things, you must take them in their context and bearing.
Rem. It is not "by" instrumentally in Peter, but born again "out of". And Peter is speaking of those in whom new birth had taken place.
F.E.R. When the Lord speaks of it, He speaks of it more abstractly.
Ques. Is it not "by means of" in Peter?
F.E.R. Through the word -- I think it might almost be rendered, according to J.N.D.s rendering, "on the principle of".
Rem. The word is distinguished from the seed. Would you say there were two things there or one?
F.E.R. Well, how would you distinguish between
{301}
them? The difficulty to me would be to make a distinction between the seed and the word.
Rem. What was of God in the soul was the result of the operation of God.
F.E.R. Well, I do not know what the seed of God is except the word; I think it is very difficult to distinguish between them. It is a figure at the very best, it is not the letter of the word, it is only a figure.
Ques. Is not the seed the word of God in living power?
Rem. You get in the parable of the sower, "The seed is the word of God".
F.E.R. Yes; I think there must be the most intimate connection between the seed and the word. If you say the word is not the seed, at all events the connection between them is of the most intimate character.
Ques. What is the difference between being born again and new birth?
F.E.R. Well, I should suppose that the testimony of God went out into the world, and everybody that was converted by that testimony is looked upon as born of the testimony, and being God's testimony they are born of God.
Ques. But the difference between new birth and being born again?
F.E.R. "Born again" is not, of course, exactly the same expression, but in @John 3 it is really "born from above"; that is not exactly the same as being "born again" in Peter, for instance.
Rem. In Peter he begins by saying, "Hath begotten us again unto a lively hope", they were already on the way.
F.E.R. Yes; that is the very introduction of the epistle, they were "begotten ... unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead". You must take these things in their connection. I have heard of that difficulty before as to the word and
{302}
the seed, but all I can say is that it is a very fine distinction; I cannot conceive what difference there could be between the seed and the word which expresses God. It is a figure taken from what is sown in the ground, because it is contrasted with corruptible seed; now if you speak of what is sown and the word of God, the connection between the two must be very intimate.
Ques. Might it not be that the word of God is sown and heard and known intellectually, without any work of God in the soul, but when God works then it becomes the seed of God?
F.E.R. Yes, it may be; when it is living, then it is the seed of God.
Ques. What would you say is the Lord's object in what He says to the disciples here as a whole?
F.E.R. The Lord's object was the maintenance of the truth, that they might not lose anything of the good that He had brought to them. This, to my mind, is the great feature of the chapter -- light brought to them in His communications, and the point with the Lord was that everything that He had brought might be maintained -- nothing lost of it; it is all on the principle of continuation. It was not simply that He was going away, but that He left the light here, and the office of the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of truth was to maintain the word in living power in connection with men. That is the great point in this chapter -- "He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you". This becomes the foundation of what follows. You could not possibly have chapters 15 and 16 if there were no company in whom the truth is livingly maintained, and for their own comfort and enjoyment too. You see, the first part of the chapter brings before them that, although He went away, He had the care of them at heart, and He would come again and receive them to Himself. Then He goes on to tell
{303}
them of the Spirit, and says, "I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever". So you have light and truth maintained here in living power by the Holy Spirit in connection with men. You see, the first part of the chapter is faith, then you get love coming out -- those are the two great principles in the chapter.
Ques. And love would desire the continuance of what has come out in Himself?
F.E.R. Yes; love is the great point, you could not have the truth maintained apart from love, "If ye love me, keep my commandments". It was the proof of loving Him, and "he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him". It all shows the great principle that everything that had been brought by Christ into this scene abode here in the power of the Holy Spirit, not a bit was to be lost, everything was to be maintained here in living power. There was no more truth to be brought out, nothing could be added to what had been brought out by Christ.
Ques. Is there any distinction between "I will come again" in verse 3, and "I will come to you" inverse 18?
F.E.R. It is the present tense in both, curiously enough. "I am coming again" it is really, "and shall receive you to myself", that is future; the "again" makes it so, I think.
Ques. Is it the rapture?
F.E.R. I do not know at all; it says "I will come again", and that makes it plain. But in verse 18 He does not speak of coming *again*, He says, "I will come to you".
Ques. Is that in the assembly?
F.E.R. Yes, spiritually; "I am coming to you ... the world sees me no longer; but ye see me".
Ques. It is in that day -- that is, the Spirit's day?
{304}
F.E.R. Yes; the Lord is there in that day, "I in you".
Ques. It is present now, it was future at the time when He spoke?
F.E.R. Yes; I think the great thing down here for the saints individually -- and it is individual in that sense, because whenever it is a question of the light it is individual -- the great point is to be in the full light of the revelation, that my soul may be in the conscious enjoyment of it down here; you have not to go to heaven to get light, you are entitled to be in all the light down here. "At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and in you" and "I will ... manifest myself to him" -- I will put Myself in evidence. If you have a case in the law courts, you put certain things in evidence; well, the Lord uses that kind of expression, I will put Myself in evidence to him -- I "will ... manifest myself to him". You get the same kind of thing further on -- "We will come unto him, and make our abode with him".
Rem. What is the force of the expression, "the Comforter"?
F.E.R. It may be rendered solicitor, or patron.
Rem. 'Advocate' is the same word.
F.E.R. It is more patron, not exactly Comforter. It was what the Lord had done for them when He was with them.
Ques. Verse 23 is different from verse 18, is it not? "We will come unto him, and make our abode with him".
F.E.R. The idea of verse 23 to me is this, the individual is brought into and maintained in the full light of the revelation, the full light of what Christ has brought. It is not the company that is contemplated there, but the individual. It is conditional, as always where the individual is in question. If you answer to the test you get the full light of the revelation,
{305}
and you are maintained in it -- in the light of the Father and the Son; "He that hath the Father hath the Son". You are maintained in the full light of the revelation; the Father can only come to the individual, as far as I see, in the way of *light*, it is only in that way that you can be brought to know divine Persons down here. The only sense in which the Father and the Son can come to us is in the way of *light* -- you are in the light of the Father and the Son.
Ques. And that light is love?
F.E.R. Yes, and a person may be conscious of it; my soul is in the sense and enjoyment of all the light that Christ has brought, and you can never, down here in this world, get further than light. The utmost point of Romans is *light*, and Romans views the saints very individually indeed, and the furthest point the individual can get to is *light*. In the assembly you get further, but as an individual the utmost you can get is *light*. In the assembly you can be outside yourself, that is the idea there; you are risen with Christ, Christ is there, and you come to the scene and sphere of proper spiritual affections if the assembly is realised in its true power.
Ques. What about "Because I live, ye shall live also"?
F.E.R. Well, that is more connected with the company, "risen together with Christ", in the scene and sphere of life, like Colossians. The two and a half tribes, viewed typically, never got into the assembly, and yet they had all the good of the light; they set forth, in type, Christians who never enter into the truth of the assembly. When conflict came they went over Jordan, but they returned again. They were content with light, and they never came into the priestly sphere, the sphere of life. There it is the thought you are "risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead" -- that is outside yourself -- it is clearly outside
{306}
man in the flesh. I think the difference between *light* and *life* is exceedingly important in that sense. It is a point of the greatest possible importance. I think that many people do not see really how great a safeguard it is to enter into the purpose of God. People who, in that sense, are purely individual, and who never get really into the purpose of God, are always more or less exposed. I am not surprised if they begin to quake a bit, "Fear hath torment" -- but when you come into the sphere of life all fear is gone, and you are out of fear then. I think it is the case with many that they put the domestic and the social before the assembly; I mean the assembly in the true sense of it.
Ques. What is the real thought of verse 20, "Ye in me, and I in you"?
F.E.R. I think it is that you are outside the world and the flesh, you are in another circle, "Ye in me, and I in you". If that is true of you, you are clearly outside the world and the flesh; you cannot have the world and the flesh and Christ, in that sense.
Ques. Is it collective?
F.E.R. I should think so. It is the true position of the church.
Ques. Is it conscious knowledge, "Ye shall know that I am in my Father ... and I in you"?
F.E.R. No, it is not that, it is objective. I think the point before the Lord all through is that they were to be right within. In the succeeding chapters it is what they were outside, but the first great point is that they must be right within. You get the company presented as right inside, and in the consciousness of their peculiar blessings inside -- outside the world, and inside with the Father. You cannot suppose there would be any great triumph in the world if they were not right within.
Rem. It is clear that all this is absolutely unintelligible to the natural man.
{307}
F.E.R. Yes; the Lord is speaking of things outside man and all that is of the flesh altogether. It is all in view of the Christian company, the little company shut out from the world; they are viewed collectively, not so much individually. Of course the wilderness is the test to us individually, but at the same time this chapter contemplates the company, and the moment you come to the company you are outside the wilderness, in the true sense, you know.
Ques. What is the difference in the way the coming of the Comforter is looked at in this chapter, and in chapter 15 as sent of Christ?
F.E.R. I think one can see the difference in one sense, that in chapter 14 it is a question of the maintenance of what had been brought by Christ. He is here in the place of Christ, and all was to be livingly maintained in the power of the Holy Spirit; but in chapter 15 He comes more in the way of testimony, He brings testimony to the glory of Christ as He alone could. Here it is more that He would "teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you" -- the Spirit would be their teacher here; it is the maintenance of the revelation Christ had brought. But in chapter 15 He brings the light of what has come to pass in heaven; one is the testimony inside, the other to enable them to be a testimony outside. If He presents any test, it is not to the company, but to the individual. Wherever He refers to the individual you find a test; you may test yourself, or you may test others in that way; it is the same in John's epistle, it is continually brought in.
Ques. "If ye loved me, ye would rejoice" -- that refers, I suppose, to His own satisfaction in going to the Father?
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. What about "That the world may know that I love the Father"?
{308}
F.E.R. I think it is testimony to His death.
Ques. A demonstration to the world?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so; it brought to light, in that sense, the love of the Father and the Son, "The Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world".
CHAPTER 15
F.E.R. What we really get here practically is that the testimony for God was limited to one Man. God had left a nation here, but the nation was no longer a testimony. Now it was one *Man* that was the testimony.
Rem. As He says here, "I am the true vine" -- the "I" is emphatic.
F.E.R. Yes; they might be the branches, but the testimony had to begin with the Vine; there could be no branches if there were not a Vine. There had been a nation, Israel had been the vine, God had brought a vine out of Egypt and planted it in His vineyard, but there was, at all events, no fruit-bearing there, and now we get the truth, and the truth is that one Man is the Vine -- "I am the true vine". I do not quite think that one could say that Christ bore fruit in that way, that would not be quite the thing, but He became the source of all fruit; in becoming the Vine He became the source of all fruit.
Rem. The fruit really came out of the branches.
F.E.R. Yes; but He was the stock, and the source and root of it.
Rem. @Psalm 1 speaks of "bringing forth his fruit in his season".
F.E.R. Yes; that is a godly man.
Ques. You speak of the godly man in an abstract way?
F.E.R. Yes; it is typical of a class.
Rem. There would be that which was fruit for the Father in Him as a Man here?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so; but, in the gospel of
{309}
John especially, He is not quite spoken of as bearing fruit.
Rem. In the actual vine neither the root nor the main stem ever bears fruit.
F.E.R. No; I think the Lord here takes the place of source of everything.
Ques. "He brought a vine out of Egypt" -- what is that?
F.E.R. Well, I think the vine ought to have produced fruit, but it did not produce fruit.
Rem. It brought forth wild grapes -- fruit to itself.
F.E.R. Quite so; there was no fruit to God; and then Israel was no benefit to anyone, neither to themselves, nor to the nations, nor to anyone, and the name of the Lord was blasphemed through them.
Ques. And they were really set here in testimony that God should be made known by them?
F.E.R. I think so; and if Israel had held to their place of faithfulness to Jehovah, they were to have been a testimony to Jehovah, and it would at the same time have ensured their own blessing and prosperity.
Rem. The church now is the vessel of the testimony, and Israel was to have been that on their own line.
F.E.R. I do not think you can speak of Christ bearing fruit exactly, but if there is any fruit at all for God, Christ is the source of it.
Ques. And the thought of a vine is for earth?
F.E.R. Well, there would be no meaning in a vine in heaven. Of course this primarily applied to the disciples, but afterwards I think the chapter widens out a little. They were at the moment specially in view, but I think there is room left for the circle to widen; the mind of God was not limited to the disciples. I think they were representative in that way.
Ques. What do you understand by fruit?
F.E.R. I think fruit is that which is agreeable to God; it is not just service rendered to Him, but
{310}
what comes out spontaneously. There is nothing artificial about fruit -- it is spontaneous. A tree under healthy conditions naturally brings forth fruit; supposing the conditions to be favourable and healthy, a vine must bear fruit, it is always fruitful. It is a most remarkable thing in regard to the vine that, except for the fruit, it is the most worthless of things, you cannot get even a rod from it.
Rem. Only fit for the burning?
F.E.R. Yes; fruit, in a certain sense, becomes testimony; there is, first of all, fruit, then testimony -- testimony to man, if you can understand me. Supposing that the fruit of the Spirit was really being produced by the saints, "love, joy, peace", etc., all that kind of thing -- if saints were really producing these things there would be testimony to mankind. It is testimony to man in the very fact of its being fruit for God. Supposing Israel had been filled with praise and thanksgiving to God in the sense of His goodness and so on, they would have been a testimony to men in the very fact of their bringing forth fruit for God. I think the mistake has been made sometimes of limiting the testimony to preaching, and all that kind of thing, instead of its being all that is moral. It is fruit for God, that is the testimony for man, it is the testimony, the proof of vitality.
Ques. "My Father is the husbandman", what is that?
F.E.R. I think that discipline, and all that kind of thing, is the work of the Father in view of the fruit-bearing, He disciplines us to that end.
Ques. Is it in any way akin to @Hebrews 12?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
Ques. And what is the end of His discipline in @Hebrews 12? That we might be partakers of His holiness?
F.E.R. Yes; but also to prove to you that you are Sons.
{311}
Ques. What about "Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away"?
F.E.R. Well, that is an extreme case; but every fruit-bearing branch He purgeth that it may bring forth more fruit.
Ques. What do you take that to be, "Every branch in me"?
F.E.R. I take that to be association; it refers to the association, association with Christ for the moment; He was divine, He took that place on the earth, and there might be association with Him where there was no vitality, and although in a certain sense that one was a branch, he would be taken away.
Rem. It has been spoken of as profession.
F.E.R. They walked no more with Him -- they could not stand the pressure and all that kind of thing.
Ques. Fruit is really Christ coming out; there could not be anything in the vine but Christ, and the source of everything was in the vine, and nothing could come out as fruit but what was in the vine.
Rem. What comes out now in the saints is the knowledge of the Father, His Father.
F.E.R. Yes; everything now is in relation to Christ. Note that He says, *My* Father, not *the* Father, the Father does all in relation to Christ, and He does it as "My Father". I think the object of the Father's discipline is that we might be partakers of His holiness, that we might be here more truly representative of Christ -- the purging and all that kind of thing, so that the saints might be here really representing Christ. All the Father's dealings have reference to Christ.
Ques. Would you connect "Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away" with the latter part of @1 Corinthians 11?
F.E.R. No, I would not; that was referring to the Lord's discipline of Christians, it has reference to
{312}
those who were really saints. I think that Christ takes account of the misuse of the body; if you do not use your body aright, I think Christ takes account of it. If a Christian gives licence to his body, becomes drunken, or anything of that kind, my impression is that Christ will take account of it, and will deal with the body; that was the case with the Corinthians themselves, "For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep". But I should imagine they were really saints; I think, too, it is a proof that there is *no* vital connection if a branch is taken away, it is cast into the fire and burned. If there is vital connection, there must be fruit. I think the great point was that there should be nothing there but what was vital, and every branch which did not bear fruit, useless branches, well, the point was to get rid of them, and then with regard to branches which did bear fruit, it was important that they should increase in fruit-bearing. In chapter 14 you get the Lord's side, but here you get our side; it is the subjective side here all through the chapter. In chapter 14 it is the objective side, "I will come to you".
Ques. John's line is subjective?
F.E.R. Yes; fruit-bearing is the evidence of life. The question of life is taken up in the early part of the gospel, and now you come to the effect of life, that is, fruit-bearing.
Ques. Has not verse 2 been used to show that even saved persons may perish?
F.E.R. Well, I do not see that there is much comfort in that. I cannot conceive what comfort it is to hold the possibility of perishing. I do not see that it can minister happiness to anyone. As a matter of fact, the whole point in this chapter depends upon *life*, not salvation, and it must be evident that only those who have *life* can, in the very nature of things, be fruit-bearers for God. Many people have no idea of anything beyond salvation.
{313}
Ques. Is there a connection between "He purgeth it" and "Now ye are clean"?
F.E.R. I should not myself have put the two thoughts together; as to "Now ye are clean" -- a thing that is clean, is clean in the very nature of it.
Rem. It should be "already clean".
Ques. They had been born of water and of the Spirit?
F.E.R. Well, it goes even further than that. I think the Lord refers to the word that He had spoken to them; it was not only that they were born again as the work of the Spirit; they were clean by the word which He had spoken to them, it is a further thing. "I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them".
Ques. But that is where it began in new birth?
F.E.R. Yes; it was, in the very nature of the thing, clean. You see, "holiness by faith", and all that kind of thing, is really wrong at the root of it. The great point in Scripture with regard to holiness is that there is something from God which characterises the very nature of it. I cannot possibly be holy except there is that which is clean in the nature of it. "And you ... hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight". Well, but that involves *two* men; it is not one man but two men: in the body of His flesh -- that is one man, the distance has disappeared through the removal of the one man; but that is effected in order to present another man, it is not the same man. It is not the man that went "in the body of his flesh through death", but another man brought in. It is "to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable" -- it is clean in that sense. So with the passage spoken of in @Hebrews 12, you are to become partakers of the divine nature, but it would not be possible unless there was the root of the thing
{314}
there. You may grow to it, of course; it has to do with the individual.
Rem. It is so contradictory even in its name; my believing that I am holy will not make me holy.
F.E.R. Yes, and there is another thing, what is the object of the faith? If you speak of having things by faith, it is the faith of something; in this case you are obliged to have the object in *yourself*. I cannot see that we have anything revealed in that sense.
Ques. Not an object, you mean?
F.E.R. No, not in connection with holiness, so far as I see. You believe in God, but then it is God that justifies -- you are justified by faith. So too you are risen together with Christ by faith; and the Christ dwells in your heart, too, by faith -- but you cannot have the same thing in holiness that I see. My own impression is that holiness is the outcome of love, it works in that way. I see that in the epistle to the Thessalonians, they were to "abound in love one toward another ... to the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father" -- it works in that way.
You see the figure of the vine carried on down to the end of verse 6; then in verse 7 you get, "If ye abide in me" -- it is no longer a question of the vine. I think verse 7 indicates a change; I think it refers to the position which the Lord had taken down here, and to their connection with Him in that position. I think the thing began very small; everything of God begins very small; the beginning of His intervention in grace was a Babe laid in a manger because there was no room for Him in the inn. Then here fruit-bearing begins with the Man. He was the Vine; it did not begin with the nation. Christianity itself began with one Man, but Christianity has become a very great factor in the history of the world. It may be the greatest imposture, as far as they can see, and yet, after all, it has been a very great factor in the world
{315}
and in the history of the world. It has produced very great results, there is no doubt about that for a moment, and yet if you come to the outset of it, it began with one *Man*.
Rem. "Cast forth as a branch" -- that could not be seen now practically.
F.E.R. No, not in the same way, but it will be in the future; we have such an anomalous state of things now, but we never get this state of things contemplated in John, at any rate in the gospel. He does warn you about deceivers and antichrists in his epistle.
Ques. Would not Ananias and Sapphira have been instances of branches cast forth?
F.E.R. Well, I think it is just possible that Ananias and Sapphira might have been Christians; I could not positively say they were not, but they were taken away most certainly.
It is striking to see that in chapter 14 you have the Comforter continuing with you for ever, and then, when you come to chapter 15 the company must be suitable -- clean and morally representative of Christ -- that is what comes out in this chapter. They were to continue in His love, even as He had kept His Father's commandments, and abode in His love. They were to be here morally a continuation of Christ; and one *thing* is certain of all of us, that we cannot possibly surpass Christ. "Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples" -- "if ye *abide* in *me*". Continuance was to be the test; I think that is the idea of continuance in John, it is the test. Many people may attach themselves to Christ and Christianity, but continuance becomes the test of their reality.
Rem. It is the test still.
F.E.R. If you continue -- it seems to express more than abide.
Ques. Has it the same meaning as in Hebrews?
F.E.R. Well, an "if" always paves the way for
{316}
some necessary consequence. "If ye continue in me, and my words continue in you, ye shall ask what ye will" -- it is the necessary moral consequence.
Rem. It is similar to that verse you were mentioning in Colossians. "You ... hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh ... if ye continue in the faith".
F.E.R. Yes; I think the great point with the Colossians was that they were being beset with philosophy; now the antidote to philosophy is faith and love; they were to continue in faith, and they were not to be moved away from the hope of the gospel. Faith brings in the mind of God, and hope connects itself with the intervention of God; these are the two principles that connect a person with God. Well, if you have got faith and hope, you will not go in for philosophy, which shuts God out. It excludes God, it excludes anything like the intervention of God. It may allow the existence of God, but philosophy depends entirely on reason in man becoming predominant, everything is to be ordered by reason.
Rem. And yet many true Christians have fallen into it?
F.E.R. Yes; I do not think the Colossians had fallen into it, but they were liable to do so, and so he brings in the "if" -- "if ye continue". I am sure the real test is continuance.
Ques. What is the asking in view of here?
F.E.R. I cannot conceive the idea that it could be asking for anything but that which would have reference to the promotion of Christ. I cannot conceive any other kind of asking coming into the chapter.
Ques. Not at all what we stand in need of in our daily path?
F.E.R. Oh, no, not at all; the point in the chapter is the continuance of Christ here, and the state and condition of the saints, so that they could be here really in fruit-bearing and testimony. The asking could only have reference to the promotion of Christ.
{317}
You get the same kind of thing in Ephesians, the heart there is governed by the Christ; if the Christ is dwelling in your heart then you could have no object to ask for but Christ. He is to dwell in your heart by faith -- the Christ in all His fulness.
Rem. "Delight thyself also in the Lord; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart".
F.E.R. Quite so; that is the spirit of it. If the Christ is dwelling in your heart by faith you are delighted in Him, and He is the desire of your heart, and you get it too.
Ques. What is the *continuation* of Christ here?
F.E.R. You would not have anything else than Christ here, and it must be Christ in continuation. You could neither have anything less nor anything more than Christ here. Now the church "is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all", and the body is that in which He Himself is expressed. My body is that in which I am expressed; you cannot see me, no man can see me -- you can see my body.
Ques. What is "me"?
F.E.R. Well, supposing I die, what do you see? Why, my body.
Ques. But *you* would not be there?
F.E.R. No; a man's body is that in which he is expressed, and so with the church, it is that in which Christ is expressed. You get the same principle coming out here in this chapter, it is the continuance of Christ down here; they were to be His disciples, the world would have to know they were His disciples because they were so like Him that it was manifest they had learnt of Him.
Rem. "They took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus"?
F.E.R. That, I think, was more recognition, it is not moral there; here, the thought is entirely moral all through the chapter, they were to be morally representative of Christ. "If ye keep my commandments,
{318}
ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love. These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full". This is a great chapter in that way, because it reveals to us that the Lord had joy here -- "that my joy may continue with you" -- the thoughts in the chapter are perfectly wonderful. The sad thing is that there is so much that is obstructive in us. It is a great grief to me, one seems to get baffled almost at every turn. It seems to me that it would be almost impossible for the Lord to have been with the Father and yet not to have had joy.
Rem. "In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father".
F.E.R. Yes; "in thy presence is fulness of joy", I think that must have been the joy of the Lord down here, He could not have been with the Father and not have had joy.
Ques. It was His own personal joy with the Father?
F.E.R. Yes; He had grief enough on this side, but on that side it must have been always joy -- nothing to cloud it in Him, nothing to baffle Him in that way. The Lord could enter into a thousand things down here, the sorrow and the wickedness of man down here, but certainly there was another side to Him, a side where there was unclouded joy. "That my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full". I suppose that the Lord took things moment by moment, but however that might be, there must have been the anticipation with Him of what lay in the end of His pathway -- the disciples could have no part in that; everything was clear for them. The Lord had anticipated everything for them, but when the moment came for Him to look the thing in the face, there was something very different from joy for Him.
Ques. Is it really the joy which He had that is to be ours?
{319}
F.E.R. Oh, it is personal, it is His joy. Here He was anxious to bring it out, and to manifest it. I think nothing can be more wonderful than the extraordinary patience of the Lord to them down here, when you consider how dull they were, and how incapable of entering into His mind.
Rem. He said, "I have a baptism to be baptised with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished". He was anxious in that sense to clear the way.
F.E.R. There are two things which come out in this chapter -- two principles -- love and joy. There is not much else in the chapter than that they had a sphere down here where it was possible for love to be in exercise, and they were His friends. But the two things in the chapter are love and joy, and then you get fruit. I think we cannot be sufficiently thankful to God for being in any way set free from things that would hinder our association together, that we should be set free from associations and influences which are incompatible with being in the Christian circle. It is immense deliverance really when we are free for that circle; but what I feel, at the same time, is that one has to be thankful to be brought into a fellowship which is not inconsistent with the truth; not that I would make much of "brethren" at all.
Rem. He speaks in chapter 17 of "my joy". "That they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves" -- the Lord counts on our having joy. "That your joy might be full" -- nothing to cloud it in that sense.
F.E.R. You know, I think we have very little touched *life*, people have not travelled the right road to it, and therefore it is but little known. It is much talked about, I know, but very little known.
Ques. What do you mean by the right road?
F.E.R. We do not see the great importance of the kingdom, and you cannot touch life without the kingdom.
{320}
It is the kingdom that leads you to life -- people want the kingdom. I do not know whether that makes things much clearer.
Rem. You must open that too a little.
F.E.R. What I see is that the first effect of grace is to bring you into the kingdom, where you get two things: direction from the Lord, and the support of the Spirit -- that is clear, I think. The Lord is the source of direction because He is the object of faith, but the Spirit is for support, you get "righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit". The effect of the direction of the Lord is to lead you into the Christian circle -- there it is that you come into life; if He directs you He must direct you into the will of the Father, into the church, and that means you are completely delivered from the world; the will of the Father is put in antithesis to the world. The will of the Father is the church, it is nothing else that I know of. The direction of the Lord leads into the Christian circle, into the church, and that is the road that people have to go; and if they are not going that road, it proves that they have not come to the Lord, they are looking to their fellow-men for guidance, and that sort of thing. When trouble comes they turn to men, that is too often the condition of people. Why have they not got direction from the Lord? The Lord can direct under any circumstances whatever.
Ques. You do not speak of direction as to our own circumstances down here, business, and so on?
F.E.R. No; it is not a question of temporal circumstances. If you were in faith your circumstances would not trouble you. You have everything through the Lord, and then the direction comes through the Lord -- the Lord is supreme in the kingdom. He is there, and He directs and guides the saints, and you have everything through Him -- you cannot touch anything save through Him. He directs you that you may be brought into the church, you have to get it
{321}
that way, and where people do not come into the church (of course, I am not speaking of the outward thing, the shell -- but in their souls), you may be sure they are defective with regard to the kingdom.
Ques. What scripture would you give us for that?
Rem. Paul was preaching the kingdom.
F.E.R. Yes; whatever does the kingdom exist for -- what is the meaning or application of the kingdom, if it is not for the saints? There is the support of the Spirit, but then, on the other side, direction. The fact is the kingdom is simply there for the church -- the kingdom is subsidiary to the church, that is as plain as possible in @Matthew 16 . In chapter 13 the kingdom is looked at as a pearl of great price -- that is a similitude of the kingdom, but the keys of the kingdom are committed to Peter, the kingdom is to be there for the church.
Ques. Is Moses, as "king in Jeshurun", a type of Christ?
F.E.R. A type of the authority of Christ. It is a most wonderful thing that there is a point in heaven from which you can get your guidance, so that you need never fear a single thing; you are perfectly certain to get guidance from there, and it will direct you into all the will of God. When you reach Ephesians, "the Christ" (that is how it should read) dwells in your hearts for testimony, you come out in testimony here; "the Christ" dwells in your heart by faith -- it is the testimony of "the Christ" Romans is the light of Christ, Colossians gives you the substance, and in Ephesians you have the fulness of the testimony.
Ques. Is there a difference between life and eternal life?
Ques. Do you get the thought of eternal life in connection with the company?
F.E.R. Yes; the flock -- "I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish", chapter 10.
{322}
Ques. But is not that the assembly, or necessary to the truth of the assembly?
F.E.R. The Lord is leading them on to that, but if you talk of the assembly, you must come on to chapters 14 and 15 but of course it is not the same company literally. The Lord shows the dimensions which the company was going to take in chapter 10, "Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring" -- the dimensions of the company were to be greatly enlarged. Of course these chapters are applicable primarily to the disciples, but at the same time you get the assembly, "I will come to you" -- that is the assembly. Now when you come to this chapter it is the other side, it is the characteristics of the company. If everybody in fellowship were to be greatly exercised to see that they were really in the truth of this chapter, it would have a good effect. As to social classes among the saints, and business relationships, and happy parties, and cliques, I would like to see them all completely smashed up.
There is one thing about the commandments of Christ which we specially value, His commandments are the expression of Himself. I think they are the expression of His pleasure, and if you do not keep His commandments, you do not know His pleasure. The Father's commandments were the expression of the Father's will and pleasure. I think love delights in the thought of being here for His pleasure. I want to be here for His pleasure, and His commandments are the expression of His pleasure. "I know that his commandment is life eternal", that is what the Lord says of the Father's commandment, and His pleasure was to do whatever the Father commanded Him. It is a very great thing to be conscious of the extent and end of the commandments; the end and extent of the Father's commandment was life eternal, and so, too, the end and extent of every commandment of Christ was our well-being and blessing, that is His
{323}
commandment. We are to be to one another what Christ is to us, and we cannot be that unless we appreciate in some measure how indispensable Christ is to us, otherwise it would be just legal, instead of being our pleasure.
Rem. Separation from associations would come in?
F.E.R. Well, I think that comes in in connection with the purging. We are chastened that we might be partakers of His holiness.
Ques. Speaking about the Lord's direction, we should not get that without dependence?
F.E.R. No; you must have a single eye, you must be looking to the Lord and to no one else.
CHAPTER 15: 13 TO END
F.E.R. It is a remarkable expression, "I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you" -- it was a very great word for the Lord to use, "Ye are my friends"; it made them the depositaries of all that He had heard from His Father, "All things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you".
Rem. Is it not a similar thought to what is said of Abraham, he was the "friend of God", and in connection with Sodom the Lord says, "Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?"
F.E.R. I think that is the idea of a friend, one to whom you may give your confidence. It seems to me a very extraordinary thing for the Lord to say to these disciples. It was not a question of how far they understood His words -- they understood very little -- but, at all events, what the Father had made known to Him, He made known to them. I think it shows how very important the communication to them must have been.
{324}
Ques. What about, "If ye do whatsoever I command you" (verse 14)?
F.E.R. I think it is evidenced in that way, it is the test of it -- "Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you".
Ques. Is not His death looked at in a special way in this chapter in connection with His friends?
F.E.R. Yes; He laid down His life for His friends, just as in chapter 10 He gives His life for the sheep. I think in this chapter all through you find He will not attribute His death to the hand of man.
Rem. It is for those given Him of His Father.
F.E.R. Yes; it is looked at in connection with them. It was in the purpose of the Lord to relieve man of the pressure under which he lay, from the pressure of death. You cannot judge of the Lord's communications to them by what they afterwards communicated in their public testimony. I think the Lord communicated to the twelve a very great deal more than they spoke of in their own public testimony.
Ques. And therefore it would be a mistake to apply to ourselves everything that was said of them?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. And I think, too, that the testimony came out according to what was suited for the moment; for instance, in the beginning of the Acts what comes out is the exaltation of Christ, but all the counsels of God could not come out in a moment. The testimony of all the twelve was, at the beginning, to His exaltation, and the Holy Spirit was witness of it. Peter's public testimony at that moment did not go further than that; but then Paul comes in, and you get a new epoch in the testimony, a great advance, for it says he preached immediately "Jesus that he is the Son of God". You get a great enlargement in that way in the public testimony. But the Jew refused that, they refused Paul's testimony, and then it is that the testimony went to the Gentiles. "It pleased God ... to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach
{325}
him among the heathen", but it had been presented to the Jew, only the Jews would not have it.
Ques. Would you say that all that comes out in the gospels has to be put together for us to get all the Lord communicated to the disciples?
F.E.R. Well, I think that the things which the Lord heard of the Father came out specially in this particular gospel, that is the line specially pursued in John's gospel. John, of course, was one of those who heard all these things, and he is the one who records them, as he says, "We know that his record is true". I think the effect of Paul's ministry was to put everything in connection with Christ in glory, but then I think all that came out in Paul's public ministry had been previously spoken of by the Lord when He was on earth.
Ques. And, therefore, taking Peter, you could not limit what was revealed to what he brought out, or even wrote?
F.E.R. No; in fact, in my own mind, I feel perfectly sure that he *knew* a very great deal more than came out publicly.
Ques. The Spirit only brought out what was suitable for the moment?
F.E.R. Quite so.
Rem. And that goes to show that, however they may differ, even James, yet it is all Christianity that they present, whether in James or Peter or John.
F.E.R. I cannot help thinking that one very greatly helps to the understanding of the others.
Ques. Christianity is really one great whole?
F.E.R. Yes; you could not understand prophecy by simply studying Isaiah; no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation, it does not carry its own interpretation, neither do I think that if a man were to give himself up to the study of one particular epistle he would gain much, he would be very defective, I am sure. One part of scripture helps to throw light
{326}
upon another. John very greatly helps to the understanding of Paul.
Ques. What is the aspect of His death here for His friends?
F.E.R. I think it was that they might be free in that sense from all that was upon them, brought into liberty, and free from the pressure that lay upon them.
Ques. Do you mean that He might bring them into intimacy?
F.E.R. No; it was to remove every hindrance from them.
Ques. With regard to what you say as to their public testimony -- I think you said on Tuesday that a man is rightly judged by his testimony?
F.E.R. Well, you rightly judge of Peter by his testimony, I think.
Ques. And yet you say he knew more than he brought out?
F.E.R. Yes; but still I think you can rightly judge of a man by his testimony. After all, nothing could be more simple and real than the testimony of Peter. If our testimony was as simple and powerful as his was, I think we should be content to be judged by it.
Rem. His ministry was truly living ministry.
F.E.R. Yes. Now with preachers in the present day there is a certain inconsistency between what is presented and the men who present it; their ways, it may be, and that which marks the men, are not in keeping with the testimony. Someone has said, and I think it is perfectly true, that if a testimony comes down from Christ at the right hand of God, there can be nothing admitted into that testimony but Christ; everything that is human, if brought into that testimony, obscures it, mars it.
Ques. Have we not all been led to feel that for ourselves?
F.E.R. Yes; and I think, as you go on, you really
{327}
get troubled in that way, and you would really rather display yourself as weak and inefficient than bring into the testimony what is artificial.
Rem. As far as Peter is concerned, what I always feel is that whatever is wanting in him as portrayed in the gospels seems to be found in his epistle.
F.E.R. Well, at all events, all things that the Lord had heard of the Father He had made known to them.
Ques. Are they all recorded in the word, do you think?
F.E.R. I should think so. You see, it is a question of the Father's communicating to them. He shows the Son the communications, and so what He heard from the Father He communicates to them. I think there were things which were not given to Him to communicate, but I think that the Lord made known to them everything that He heard from the Father. He had heard them from the Father in order that He might communicate them to them. But I do think that there might be things between the Father and the Son which were incommunicable; for instance, "Of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father". Now I think that simply means that, while there could be nothing hid from the Son, just because He was the Son, there were at the same time things which were not given to the Son to communicate.
Rem. And that just shows the perfection of the Servant.
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. He took that place and He communicates what is given Him to communicate, but He does not go outside the Servant's place which He had taken.
Rem. Even Paul speaks of such things.
F.E.R. Yes; he heard things in heaven which were incommunicable on earth.
Ques. I suppose you must discriminate between
{328}
what the Lord was as Man, and what He was as the Son?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
Ques. So when it says, "neither the Son" it is as Man?
F.E.R. As in that place as being a prophet -- all that was involved in His place as Man down here.
Ques. Then it is not *the* Son there; does not the expression "the Son" generally give the thought of the Son with the Father?
F.E.R. Yes; but then it is always in grace.
Ques. You only get that expression, "neither the Son", in Mark?
F.E.R. Yes, it is in Mark.
Ques. "All things that I have heard of my Father" is as Man?
F.E.R. In the place of Man, it is the Son in the place of Man; you must preserve the idea of the Son, it is that Person in place of Servant, but then it is from "my Father", it is not as from God, but from His Father. I think it was all the counsels of the Father, all the communications of the Father's love.
Rem. As "the Son" He did not need communications.
F.E.R. No; it is that Person in that place; and you must not lose the idea of the Person; it is truly that Person in that place, and He is perfectly consistent with the place which He had taken.
Rem. People so often confound the thought of who was there, and what was the Person who was there.
F.E.R. Yes; as far as I understand it, I think it is most important to keep distinctly before you that Person, so that you never have any other Person before you. He may speak of Himself as Son of man, or otherwise, but it was *that* Person; whatever may be the designation of that Person, it is just that Person who gives character to the whole thing.
Ques. And you think it is dangerous to speak of
{329}
one thing being true of Him as Man, and another being true of Him as God?
F.E.R. Well, I do not think you can do it.
Rem. In chapter 1 you get every title brought in, but it is the same Person all through.
F.E.R. Yes; in that chapter you get all sorts of designations and titles. But if you speak of the Queen you speak of that person officially, you designate her by one particular title. Why, it is the commonest thing possible in everyday life, supposing the head of the house to be a doctor, or a military officer, he is known commonly as the Doctor, or the General, as the case may be; and, what is more, you refer the title to that person when you are not speaking of him in his official capacity at all; it is simply a designation by which he is commonly known. Of course when the Lord uses any particular designation there is a special force attached to it; for example, when He speaks of the Son of man coming "in the glory of his Father", you would have thought that there He would have spoken of Himself as "the Son", but it is as "Son of man". "Son of man" is the designation of the One who comes, and He comes in the glory of His Father.
Rem. It is really very simple, but it has brought in much confusion.
F.E.R. Well, I think the confusion has arisen from the attempt to press the union of God and man; it has obscured people very greatly, so that they have not really apprehended the true force of the incarnation.
Rem. In the effort to describe *what* He was, they have forgotten *who* He was.
F.E.R. I would much rather know *who* He was.
Now, in the expression, "I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain", the Lord keeps up the idea of fruit. You lose the vine, but He keeps up the idea of the fruit.
{330}
Ques. What do you understand by "fruit"?
F.E.R. Well, I think the fruit was the proper spontaneous result of Christianity, and the fruits were to abide here, the moral results of the truth were to remain here. You could not speak exactly of persons as being fruit, though of course, without the persons, you could not have the fruit; and yet, after all, you could not speak of the persons quite as fruit; I think what came out in them was the fruit. I do not think the Lord is speaking here simply of the conversion of people, but that there might be spontaneous, moral effects of the truth in the way of love, and joy, all the proper effects of the truth, the fruits of the Spirit.
Rem. And the first three great fruits of the Spirit were in them.
F.E.R. Yes: love, joy, peace. The great testimony here of Christianity was to be the fruit of the Spirit, it was to be a living testimony here, and the way in which life is expressed is in *fruit* -- that is what the Lord intended.
Rem. I was struck only the other day in seeing the charge given to Timothy, "the end of the commandment is *love*", it is the moral result.
F.E.R. Yes; the two things of which the Lord speaks here are love and joy; His commandment is that they should *love* one another, and then He speaks these things that their joy might be full. I think one has to remember this, that things are not altered in that way either above or below. The Lord is still at the right hand of God, and the Spirit is still here.
Ques. And man still is the same?
F.E.R. Yes; it is painful to think of the continued tendency there is to obscure the truth by putting some kind of human setting to it, or putting it in a mould. You see that coming out even in the Reformation: what truth they had was soon spoiled by trying to put it in some human form or setting, so that it should become defined; but the moment you try to
{331}
deal with moral things in that way you spoil them, they are incapable of such treatment.
Rem. The life goes out of them directly.
F.E.R. Yes; very many people have a great idea of things being put into a hard-and-fast form; they think it gives them a kind of security, but creeds have never been a security for man yet. It is not that which the Lord looks for all through John's gospel. What the Lord looks for in this chapter is really testimony from them, their fruit was the testimony, and fruit is a very living thing. Now you cannot define life, or the workings of life, because life, if it is in activity, will burst all moulds. No one could attempt to define life, it is without limit. "That your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you". There is no doubt the apostles had this; I think it was all made good to them, and one would certainly gather that they had the greatest sense of freedom in asking.
Ques. After the descent of the Spirit?
F.E.R. Yes; I do not think that they had any doubt at all as to getting what they asked for. I think the apostles and the others were so simply in the reality of things, they were so perfectly in the reality of it all, that there was no restraint with them. It seems to me that the opening of the first epistle of John, "Truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ", just expresses the sense of what the apostles had as to things. It was the sense they had of the testimony, they had part in it in company with the Father and the Son, and the practical result of that was they had the most complete liberty in going to the Father.
Ques. Do you get any reference to the Father in the Acts?
F.E.R. No, you do not; their petitions were simply addressed to the Lord or to God.
{332}
Rem. But there is a great definiteness in their asking, they asked quite simply.
Rem. You get one remarkable expression in the Acts, "They were filled with joy, and with the Holy Spirit".
Rem. I was thinking of what you were saying as to their being so in the reality of things, the things really came of which the Lord had spoken to them.
F.E.R. Quite so. I think you might attribute everything to the apostles; even if there is fruit from us now, it is really the result of the apostles labours. I only spoke of that passage in @1 John 1 because it marks the peculiar place the apostles had in connection with their testimony, a place which only the apostles could have. One can understand the very great force with which the Lord enjoined them to love one another. He does not tell them to hate the world, though He tells them to expect that the world will hate them; but He does command them that they should love one another. He was only enjoining on them what they had seen in Him.
Rem. And the natural effect of the manifestation of love inside would bring out the hatred of the world.
F.E.R. Yes; the truth is that man hates God, and so it is folly to attempt to discuss these things with him. The more you know of the natural man the more you know that the natural man hates God. You find that in everyday life, however pleasantly you may appear to get on, and I am sure I always try to do that, and naturally would, but, after all, you feel it is all there, you feel it in coming into contact with men.
Rem. It struck me that the more we realised that, the more we, as Christians, would love one another.
F.E.R. Yes; the Lord looks upon the disciples in that light, as a little company in the midst of a very troubled scene, but they were to love one another. I think Christians in system have none of the benefits
{333}
of it all, they go on with certain civilities, and with certain good works, and so on, but they do not come out properly into the good of the Christian circle.
Rem. And John, who brings out more about love than anybody, is the one who brings out most clearly the sharp line between the two things.
F.E.R. Yes; on the one hand He commands us to love one another, and on the other we must not be surprised if the world hates us. It was only this morning I was thinking how very little, if at all, we appreciate the love of the Lord to us. We often think that, if we make mistakes, the Lord looks severely upon us; but it is the other way round -- if we get things just a little bit more clearly the Lord is really delighted. Just think what a pleasure it is to our teachers to see one getting hold of things a little bit, it is a real pleasure to them. Well, do you not think the Lord is pleased too? Have not they, after all, the same kind of thought as the Lord?
Rem. When Solomon asked for an understanding heart, it is said, "It pleased the Lord".
F.E.R. Yes; when the Lord sees one going on with purpose of heart, or if He sees one getting anything a little more clearly, my impression is it is a pleasure to Him. You do not get these things in a kind of miraculous way, you get them when you are prepared for them. And if a spiritual man is pleased because one seems to be making a little advance in spiritual things, I think the Lord must be too. And what a thing it is to think of the Lord in that way, He has got His eye upon me, and He sees if I have got hold of something that is a help to me, and He is pleased at it.
Rem. It is a very precious thing.
F.E.R. Yes, I think so; but people have got an idea the other way, that the Lord is severe upon their defects, and so on.
{334}
Rem. The natural thought of man is that God will judge him.
F.E.R. Yes; but what is really God's greatest pleasure with regard to man? Why, to give him light, that is really the supreme delight of God. He knows that man is in darkness, and under pressure, and the supreme pleasure of God is to give him light; but then the instant the man gets a little bit of light, the natural tendency is to begin to reason instead of accepting the light, as though indeed he was capable of judging.
Rem. I have thought sometimes that it is when you get the idea of separation coming in that you get hatred, as here in verse 19.
F.E.R. Yes; when the Lord Himself began His ministry, you do not find the same kind of hatred coming out; but when He brings out separation, when He goes up into a mountain and chooses twelve disciples, His friends say He is mad, and the Pharisees say that He has a devil, they could not bear that sort of thing. The Lord here does not lead them to anticipate any better treatment than He Himself had had; the world remained what it ever was, only that it was put into a much more awful position than it had been in before. You do not get the idea of *sin* in the Old Testament, there it is a question of *sins*; but in the New Testament, especially in John, you get the principle of sin coming out.
Ques. God must be presented perfectly, and man reject Him, to fully discover what sin is?
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. One needs, too, to see the way in which God has dealt with sin in the cross?
F.E.R. Yes; but it was not dealt with in that way until it had been fully proved. The world is convicted of sin "because they believe not on me". The ground that the Lord takes at the close of the chapter is,
{335}
"They have both seen and hated both me and my Father". God had put Himself in the presence of man, in the Person of His Son, and they had both seen and hated both the Father and the Son; they hated the Lord without a cause -- they hated Him gratuitously.
Ques. Is lawlessness the rejection of God?
F.E.R. Yes; is it not a solemn thing that a fallen creature should attempt to judge God, and not only that, but he repudiates the idea of God coming into His own creation.
Rem. Man's moral state has been fully proved in that he rejected God when He was here.
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. I think I can perfectly well understand it; my conviction is that if it were possible for Christ to come into the world as He came before, He would not find much better treatment now than He found then. It is certain that He would not touch Christianity as it exists now, He must be outside of that just as He was outside Judaism then.
Ques. You mean outside Christianity as it exists in the world?
F.E.R. It has become the world, it embodies all the principles of the world, and when you come to Babylon, in her is found all the blood of the saints and the martyrs. I think the point is that God came -- God Himself came.
Ques. And displayed Himself in affection?
F.E.R. Yes; when you think of all the things the Lord did, they were all works in blessing to man; you find that all through this gospel, but God was not at all according to man's mind. Even the very grace which came out in Christ was repugnant to man, because the effect and principle of grace was to put every man upon the same level, else it is not grace at all, and men were not at all prepared for that. Every man, even though he be a Christian of growth, stands
{336}
in need of grace; man was under death -- death reigned, and everybody was equal in the presence of grace; that was what was so exceedingly repugnant to man, and still is to the feelings of many. If the Son came in grace, there could be no admixture of law and grace.
Ques. "If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my word, they will keep also yours", what about that?
F.E.R. I think it is put in that way so that they were not to anticipate to be differently treated from what He Himself had been. Then, at the close of the chapter, you come to the witness of the Holy Spirit.
Rem. Here it is, "whom I will send to you".
F.E.R. Yes.
Rem. It is a different testimony from what we get in chapter 14.
F.E.R. Yes; I think the great point in chapter 14 is that everything that Christ had communicated was to be maintained, it was the maintenance of everything that had been brought by Christ. Everything was to be made good that Christ had taught them. But the point in this chapter is that you have Christ in glory -- "He shall testify of me". I think the revelation of the Father, and all that, was complete; there was nothing to be added to that, but there was the position which He was to take, and the Holy Spirit came down as the witness of that position. Christ did not leave anything unrevealed, but He Himself was going to take a certain position, and the Holy Spirit was the witness of that glory. That is the witness of the Holy Spirit, as I understand it -- it was to the position taken by the One who had made the revelation when down here; the Holy Spirit came as testimony to the place He had taken at the right hand of God. Then witness comes out also from the disciples; they were looked at as testifying, because they had been with Him from
{337}
the outset. They bore witness by the Spirit to the exaltation of Christ, that was the burden of Peter's preaching. The Holy Spirit bore witness through them, but He witnessed to what they could not of themselves have borne witness to, they could not witness to the glory. They bore witness to the death and resurrection, but they could not witness to the glory. It is important to notice that they were to bear witness of Him as having been with Him from the outset; that is a very characteristic expression with John, and a very important one too.
Ques. What is the force of "from the beginning"?
F.E.R. It is what I should call the beginning of a new departure, that is the principle of John. It was not in any way maintaining a connection with what went before, but the introduction of what was entirely and wholly new. The testimony was something entirely new, not linking up what had been -- God bringing in the kingdom and establishing the promises, and so on -- but a wholly new departure. The new takes precedence of the old; the old comes in and has its own place, but the new takes precedence; and what comes out in John takes the pre-eminent place, and everything that has to do with the establishment of the promises, and so on, comes under it. The expression "from the outset" is a very great and characteristic expression in John's writings. It is a new start entirely.
Rem. Luke speaks of their being, from the outset, "eye-witnesses of and attendants on the Word".
F.E.R. Yes, he does, "on the Word", it is God Himself in testimony.
Rem. It is not the side of man's responsibilities.
F.E.R. That is all closed; it is not even on the line of things which come in in connection with God's faithfulness, but a *new departure entirely*. It is all according to the counsels of His love.
{338}
CHAPTER 16
F.E.R. It is evident that, in the mind of the Lord, it was the Jew who was going to turn persecutor. "The time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service". Paul was a pretty good expression of it. Then He goes on, "These things will they do unto you" -- not because they have not known God, but because "they have not known the Father, nor me". Anyone instructed in the knowledge of the Father and the Son could never turn persecutor, and if a man is a persecutor it means this much, he does not *know* the *Father* or the *Son*.
Ques. They had the knowledge of God, I suppose, in a way, under law; there was a way in which God had made Himself known as under law, and they could persecute as knowing God in that way?
F.E.R. I think they had become legal; the effect of the law was to make men legal, if they took it up in the mere letter of it -- the outward thing.
Rem. And a legal man always persecutes.
F.E.R. The legal man to my mind is a man who covers up a strong will under a cloak of religiousness. You will find a great deal of that about now. The most curious thing is that people make the greatest mistakes about will; people mistake will in a mechanical sense, for will in a *moral* sense. You see people who, in a kind of way, will scarcely lift their fingers, who will scarcely exert themselves in any way; even, for instance, in their way of singing, some people will scarcely move themselves even in that, and they think that they are in that way practically setting their will aside. They are mistaking will in a *mechanical* sense, for will in a *moral* sense. In one sense, I cannot lift my hand without an exertion of my will, but there is nothing *moral* about that.
Rem. Only the knowledge of *grace* can really set will aside.
{339}
F.E.R. Yes; grace practically teaches us that; if you have light from God, you see that the will of man has brought nothing but confusion into the world, it all ends in confusion, so the best thing possible is that the will of man should be set aside. If place is given to the will of man, you see there are so many of us, and it is not likely that you could get all those wills in accord. Take the history of nations, for example, think of all the different wills at work there; but then all these different wills only bring confusion into the world! So grace comes in to set aside the will of man, and to subjugate man to God.
Rem. I suppose it is man's will today that creates all the confusion in the world?
F.E.R. Yes; the spirit of disobedience already works; lawlessness, and all that kind of thing, is there, but covered up by a very fair exterior of voluntary humility; but then that is only, after all, the result of strength of will and purpose; it is unsubdued will covered up by fair exterior. Man's will, of course, is legal.
Ques. And man's will is the very principle of sin?
F.E.R. Yes; it is lawlessness.
Ques. Would you call the man legal who troubles about weeks and days?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so; he would not be very particular about days and weeks if he saw that grace had set aside the man. You see, grace works to set you free of the man that was obnoxious to God; now if grace is effective in you, you get rid of that man; and days and weeks are, after all, only connected with *that* man -- the great point is to get rid of that man.
Ques. They are really occupied with making fallen man better?
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. All this has to begin at home, I suppose you would say?
{340}
F.E.R. Well, that is always a perfectly safe place to begin.
Ques. Was it this that spoiled the Galatians, do you think?
F.E.R. Yes; certainly their wills were not at all in accord; but, if you think of it, it is very striking what the apostle says to them, "before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you" -- they had had a very full testimony of the cross, but then apparently the testimony had not become effective in them, they were prepared to allow the man who had been removed for God in the cross; because, if that man was gone, it is evident he did not want to be circumcised. Circumcision is the putting off the body of the *flesh*, that is, you come back to your baptism; but then baptism is burial, and if a man is buried there is no object in circumcising him.
Ques. They were wrapped up in legality?
F.E.R. I think it was that they were trying to run with the world, it was trying to get rid of the offence of the cross, and that was, in a sense, running with the world.
Ques. And was it so too with the Colossians?
F.E.R. Not exactly; I do not think it was the world that was the snare to them. Now with the Corinthians, and the Galatians too, it *was* the world; it was the world in its wanton form with the Corinthians, and in its religious form with the Galatians. But with the Colossians it was not that, it was more reason and imagination, and that is the great snare in the present day, I believe.
Rem. Where it says, "Touch not; taste not; handle not"?
F.E.R. Yes; all that is connected with asceticism; but, you see, their imagination was also at work, they were intruding into those things which they had not seen, and their reason was at work, they were to beware
{341}
lest any spoiled them through philosophy and vain deceit.
Ques. And in all three cases it was a question of will?
F.E.R. Yes, it was all will.
Rem. So that in presenting Christ crucified to souls, you have to look that it may become effective in those you seek to teach?
F.E.R. Yes; that is the teaching of grace. The cross is the full expression of the grace of God; but then the grace has to become effective in each one of us, it has got to teach us. "The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, *teaching* us" -- it hath appeared, that is, in the cross; but then it says, "teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts" -- well, that is the man that is *gone*; and then it goes on, "we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world". That goes on to Christ.
Ques. And that was done at the start?
F.E.R. Quite so; you could not put righteousness and sobriety on the first man at all; it is the practical bringing in of Christ, we walk as He walked -- as He walked as a Man down here.
Ques. And to have these three things you must displace self?
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. You have to come back to your baptism.
Rem. Do you not see it in the woman in chapter 4 -- you have had the Lamb of God, and then the One lifted up, and then in chapter 4 you get the woman in whom grace had become effective?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so; you see there the grace that practically emancipates a person from the control of sin. I will give you a verse that makes it plain: "That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life" -- the grace is established in a person, in the individual.
{342}
It is established in a Christian in the power of the Holy Spirit, and it takes complete possession of him -- it *reigns*. Well then, what is "through righteousness"? Why, the man that is obnoxious to God has gone in the cross, and the water that Christ gives is a well of water that springs up to eternal life. That is the reign of grace in the individual. It is "righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit".
Ques. And the object is to bring you to eternal life?
F.E.R. Yes; to lead you from the responsible man to Christ; from the first man to the Second.
Ques. And that is why you say the kingdom subsists for our blessing?
F.E.R. Quite so. "God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son", that is the point you want to get to. I made the remark the other day, I dare say all did not understand it, that eternal life is presented in Scripture *objectively*, because it is always presented to us in another Man, and that other Man is the expression of it. He is "the true God, and eternal life". That is an objective idea, not a subjective one.
Rem. Objective, because it is entirely outside ourselves?
F.E.R. Outside ourselves, and in another Man, and we have to find it in Him.
Ques. What is the difference of idea between "through our Lord Jesus Christ" in @Romans 5, and "eternal life in Christ Jesus" at the end of @Romans 6?
F.E.R. It is grace in chapter 5, that grace might reign; but then, in the next chapter, it is "The wages of sin is death; but the act of favour of God, eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord" -- there again the thought is objective, it is the gift of God, eternal life *in* Christ Jesus.
Ques. In the one chapter it is what is administered through Jesus Christ, and in the next chapter it is positional, it is in Jesus Christ?
{343}
F.E.R. Yes; in chapter 5 He is the great Administrator, grace reigns through Him. To my mind, everything connected with the kingdom is most beautiful -- I mean the process of grace, and the acting of grace in the Lord Jesus, the nurture and admonition of the Lord -- that is, the teaching of the Lord. Then you are to carry out the same thing in regard of your children, but you cannot do that if you do not understand for yourself the nurture and admonition of the Lord. It is all with a view to the practically setting aside in you of what has been set aside for God; that is the working and object of the nurture and admonition of the Lord -- He will practically set aside in you what has been judged in the cross for God; you come under His nurture and discipline.
Rem. One can see in that way how very important is the truth of the kingdom.
F.E.R. Yes; the working of it is to bring you to eternal life, it is "unto eternal life", that is *grace*. I think it is most beautiful to be under grace; wherever you have grace at work it has nothing but your benefit in view; of course it is all according to God, and to bring you into power.
Ques. And into deliverance from sin?
F.E.R. Yes, practically; it is to bring about in you the removal of the man that is removed for God -- and that is eternal life.
Ques. Was it not always God's purpose to set man free from sin?
F.E.R. Yes; but it all has to be made good in us individually as believers; and the great point down here in this world is to be free from the domination of sin; it is all new creation.
Rem. I was thinking of how Peter in the beginning of the Acts says, "God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities", as if that was God's purpose.
{344}
F.E.R. Yes; and you get again, "This is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins", @Romans 11: 27. It is all on the same line.
A point that has struck me very much in thinking of the death and resurrection of Christ is that, speaking of man generally, he is not affected by sin -- I mean not painfully affected by sin, he likes it. As to the sin itself, he may, of course, have to suffer for the indulgence of it, but it is not the sin itself that painfully affects him, it is not that that makes him suffer. Now to God sin is obnoxious in itself; and sin must go, and in the death of Christ, not only sin but the man himself went in judgment. Now what you can often affect men by is death and judgment, but you do not see all that met in the *death* of Christ, but in the *resurrection*. God removed first that which was obnoxious to Himself, and, in the resurrection of Christ, He dealt with that by which man is affected, death and the fear of judgment; and then grace comes in to practically set aside in us what has been removed for God, both sin and the man. It is that which really brings deliverance.
Ques. What would you say is the difference between righteousness and reconciliation?
F.E.R. Well, I think reconciliation is based on righteousness; reconciliation indicates that the distance is gone, but it is gone in righteousness. Righteousness brings in the truth that man is gone judicially, he has been removed in sacrifice, it is the sacrifice that testifies to the righteousness. The man is removed and reconciliation is effected but according to righteousness.
Rem. You see how the two are connected in @2 Corinthians 5, do you not?
F.E.R. Yes; the ministry of reconciliation there is connected with that, "Be ye reconciled to God. For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him".
{345}
Now, I think, returning to our chapter, it is pretty plain that if a man does not accept the light of the Father and the Son, the tendency with him will be to turn persecutor, and with the religious man too.
Ques. How would you explain it?
F.E.R. Well, the purpose of God is abhorrent to man, as you know, and the thought of "the Father and the Son" does not exactly bring in the thought of blessing to the world, as such; it comes in really to conduct man out of the world. I do not think "the Father and the Son" is quite the same idea as in Almighty and Jehovah, names in connection with man, or a people here upon earth.
Rem. When it is a question of going out of the world, they come out of God's house and say, "Go up, thou bald head" -- that is what we see in connection with Elisha.
F.E.R. Yes; and I think you must see that the revelation of the love of God is in the Son, you must have the Father and the Son -- it is in the Son that the love of God comes out. It indicates the sovereignty of love. The Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world, but love will take its own way of carrying this into effect.
Ques. In a certain sense the world lost its Saviour?
F.E.R. I think it did. The whole gospel of John is written on the line of the Father and the Son. It begins with it, and all through John it is the activity of love that comes out. You see the Father and the Son, as the Lord says, "No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him" -- it is the activity of love down here; but at the same time, if there is the activity of love, there is the sovereignty of love, too. It is illustrated in the words, "Jacob have I loved". Man naturally dislikes and refuses the idea of the sovereignty of God's love.
Rem. It was not because there was anything more in Jacob than in Esau that God loved him.
{346}
F.E.R. I do not think so; it just expresses the sovereignty of God; Jacob's ways and character were just as repugnant to God as were Esau's. As a matter of fact, Esau was the more manly of the two, as men think.
Ques. When you come to the Father and the Son, you could only have a witness of love?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
Ques. Must righteousness therefore be settled before you can touch this point?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
Ques. God's righteousness in that way was as much for Esau as for Jacob, but not His love.
F.E.R. Quite so. You do not get the love of God coming out until @Romans 5, and yet His righteousness has been shown to be towards all; and His power too, in a sense; but you do not get His love until chapter 5. The first mention of love, as far as I know, is when it says, "The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given unto us".
Rem. The love of God is made known to people, but they will not be judged by it.
F.E.R. No. Grace brings salvation to all men, but I could not exactly speak of the love of God being in that way towards all men. The Jew was in a peculiar position given to him of God; he had the benefit of a great deal of light; he had the oracles of God, and a very great deal of light from God; but then the point is that the Son came, and would he accept that?
Rem. Had he allowed that, it must have set him aside, and he refused it.
F.E.R. I think that was it. "Men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil". "But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God".
{347}
Rem. It is only a man who does that who comes to the light.
F.E.R. Yes; only a man who does truth. You see that the revelation came first to the Jew and he was tested by it; Christ was presented to the Jew with abundant proof that He was the Son of God. He did the Father's works and spoke the Father's word, and it was not a question as to whether the Jew could understand Him entirely, but was he affected by the revelation? There was plenty to affect them, even people who did not understand Him at all, there was the evidence of His works, there was no harshness or anything of that kind.
Rem. It says they "wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth".
F.E.R. Yes; the Lord would not have condemned them for not understanding, but the thing was they were not themselves affected.
Ques. The disciples themselves did not understand Him much?
F.E.R. No, very little; and yet you see how the Lord attributes to them a very great deal more than was apparent.
Ques. Then He told them all these things in order that they might not be affected when they came?
F.E.R. Yes; you see the very people they had looked up to had turned persecutors, and would kill them. I think one can understand that if you were brought up, for instance, in the Church of England, how that you might receive light, and then you come to find that the very people you have been accustomed to look up to, the dignitaries of the church, are turning persecutors -- it would be a very bitter lesson to you. And I think it was a very bitter lesson for those poor disciples to learn, and the Lord foresaw that and prepared them for it. The real thing was that those who hated them had not known the Father nor Him.
{348}
Ques. What is meant by "render service to God" in verse 2?
F.E.R. It is the word for offering service to God; but if they had known the Father or Him they would have known love. No intelligent Christian could turn persecutor -- it is an impossibility. If he did so, he would only prove that he did not know the Father or the Son. There is nothing much more dreadful than human will covered up by ecclesiastical zeal, there is no end of it; it is really "Saul ... breathing out threatenings and slaughter". You take the history of this country at the time of the Reformation; it was not simply the Roman Catholic party that turned persecutors, no doubt the Protestants were that too. There was ecclesiastical zeal, but underneath there was man's will ready to assert itself; and what was wrong in one could not be right in the other. I could not think that any of them ever knew the Father or the Son; they never got beyond a justified man, or reached the idea of a man in Christ, they never got beyond grace, and they had not a very clear idea even of that. I think it is very beautiful to see the great consideration and tenderness of the Lord towards the disciples, that warns them here of what they might have to encounter, so that it should not take them at all unawares. Then He says later, "I go my way" -- "But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart", and one can well understand it; it would have been very wonderful if sorrow had not filled their hearts. The Lord had been with them daily, and now He was going away from them. It might be in a kind of way human, but then we are human.
Rem. And then He brings in the truth of the Comforter?
F.E.R. Yes; and when He was come He would reprove the world; the Lord, in His lifetime, had stood between them and it, as He said at the end, "If
{349}
therefore ye seek me, let these go their way", but now He would send them another Comforter.
Ques. Do you think He intended a reproof when He said, "None of you asketh me, Whither goest thou"?
F.E.R. Well, I think it was selfish, in a kind of way.
Rem. But they were not on the risen side of the cross, and that makes all the difference, the question had not been settled which must have troubled every pious soul.
F.E.R. Yes; they were not in the truth of resurrection. It is a most wonderful thing to be in the light of resurrection.
Rem. They were really neither in the light of His death, nor of His resurrection.
F.E.R. No; the great point with them was not that *He* should die, but only that in their eyes things were all going wrong -- the Messiah dying, and the religious leaders becoming their persecutors. They were to see their leaders, their great people, their priests, killing Him.
Rem. And then too the people had said, "We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever ... who is this Son of man?" They could not have said "out of the prophets", for the burden of the prophets was that Christ should suffer and die, and be raised from the dead.
Ques. I suppose that, like the mass of people today, they had some way of getting over these things, covering them up in some way?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. I think we judge too much by our own way of looking at things. We have been taught to look at things simply, and to come simply to the truth, and we think they looked at the truth in the same way. But there was so much legality, and so on, with the Jew, that the authority of Scripture was got rid of in that way.
Ques. I suppose that, in the case of the disciples,
{350}
they were insensibly drawn on by a power over them.
F.E.R. Yes, I think so; a Person was the attraction. I think it is the great end to which Christ is drawing in the present time, attracting to, and governing people by a Person.
Ques. And that is not accomplished by working miracles?
F.E.R. Oh, no; the miracles came in to confirm their faith, but the faith was there. The disciples believed on Him before. And it says, too, of them who saw the miracles and believed, that He did not commit Himself to them, He did not believe in them.
Rem. Because their faith simply rested on outward miracles, and if some day He did not work miracles, then it was all over.
F.E.R. Now the Lord brings out here the great truth that it was expedient for them that He should go away, "For if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you". You cannot conceive a much more wonderful thing than that the interest of the Lord was taken up with those few poor men. It is blessed to think that God is not like men. A great man in this world likes to be taken up with great things, but, as far as I see, there is nothing either great or small with God; God could not put any sanction on anything that men call great down here. Of course, we know great results come out of God's workings, the final working out of God's way is great. The effect of a Babe laid in the manger is the complete overthrow of all that exists -- very great results will come out of that which seems, to the natural eye, to be small enough.
Rem. But yet the angels could say at His birth, "Glory to God in the highest".
F.E.R. Yes, quite so; and you see in the case of the children of Israel, Balaam looked at them
{351}
from above, and could speak of them from that standpoint, very much more wonderfully than Moses did.
Rem. We find that nearly all the true witnesses were small and despised during their lifetime.
F.E.R. That was a proof of the obstinacy of the people, "Your fathers killed them ... and ye build their sepulchres".
Rem. God's weights and measures are absolutely moral.
F.E.R. But it is beautiful to see the interest of the Lord in this little company, so that He says, "If I go away I will send you another Comforter". What a sense they must have had, on the day of Pentecost, when they really received the promise of the Father, of its connection with Christ.
Rem. It is a wonderful thought that He had come to make known the Father, and now, having done that, He is going away, and He says, "I will send the Comforter".
F.E.R. Yes, it is when the revelation of the Father is complete that He sends the Comforter, He sends Him from the Father and He Himself is gone to the Father. It is a very important point to see that the Comforter is sent from the Father, because it connects those who have the Comforter with the Father.
Rem. So that you see the Father and the Son and the Comforter all occupied with this little company.
F.E.R. Yes; you see just the same thing in the Ephesians. "The Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ... that he would grant you to be strengthened with might by his *Spirit* in the inner man; that the *Christ* may dwell in your hearts by faith". So that you are to be filled to all the fulness of God -- Father, Son, and Spirit. What governs your heart is Christ, the strengthening is of the Spirit, and the source of it all is the Father. Christians are bound up in that sense with all the fulness of the Godhead.
Rem. "Now I go my way to him that sent me".
{352}
F.E.R. That was the way He was going to take. He might have gone back by other ways, but the path He takes really leads through death; other ways would not have been suitable to the divine counsels. All was to come in on that platform, the glory of the Father -- the great foundation for the Father's glory must be laid. He went into death and He was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father. In John the ground of it all is that the world might know that He loved the Father; it is love to the Father that is the motive, "that the world may know that I *love* the Father", it was a testimony to His love of the Father.
Then you get the very important principle coming out, the conviction of the world in connection with the presence of the Holy Spirit; the world-system is convicted, but, on the other hand, you get the things of Christ brought in -- the Father's things. These are the two things put in contrast in the chapter. Demonstration is brought to the world by the presence of the Comforter, but the same Comforter makes known the Father's things to them. "All things that the Father hath are mine". It brings to light the whole new order of things in connection with the Father.
Ques. Is it in the abstract that He brings demonstration to the world?
F.E.R. What the Lord was occupied with here was the state of the disciples, He puts things in their proper place in them. The world was convicted in the hearts of the disciples; demonstration is brought to those who have the Spirit, that they may really enter into the true position of things, "We are of God, and the whole world lies in the wicked one", that is the conclusion you are bound to come to. If sin and righteousness come to an issue, the result must be judgment. The prince of this world is judged morally in connection with the presence of Christ here; sin and righteousness have been brought to an issue, "because they believe not on me". The world
{353}
in that way has been tested, and failed; it is the last overture that could be made to the world, and the end of it is, "they believe not on me".
Rem. Then it is consequent upon His rejection by the world that He says in chapter 17, "I pray not for the world".
F.E.R. Yes, and then He will never be seen again in this world, "Ye see me no more".
The moment the church lost the power of the Holy Ghost, they fell under the power of the world. There was nothing else for them.
Rem. They lost all that moral judgment of things which the Spirit alone could give them.
F.E.R. Exactly. Christ alone could tell them of the Father's things, and they lost all that, too. The only possible thing to be done in such a state of things is to recognise the presence of the Spirit. When the virgins were awakened by the midnight cry, you find that the wise virgins had oil in their vessels with their lamps; they returned, in that sense, to the Spirit.
Ques. In what does righteousness consist, would you say, "Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more"?
F.E.R. It is a question between the Father and the world; there is no righteousness here, and so Christ goes to the Father, where there is righteousness.
Rem. And what passes as righteousness in the world has no knowledge of the Father in it.
F.E.R. No; and therefore what you may expect is this, that there is no single Christian body that, sooner or later, may not turn persecutor, only let the conditions be open for it. I would not trust a dissenting body any more than the church, and I would not trust the church more than popery.
I think those principles referred to in this chapter which claim the rights of God here in the world are only known to the one who has the Holy Spirit, if the foundations are destroyed.
{354}
Ques. You are referring now to the demonstration?
F.E.R. Yes; if the foundations are destroyed, what are the righteous to do? Their refuge is in the Holy Spirit, and then it is seen that the principles which maintain divine rights still remain, although they may not be in evidence.
Rem. And that leads you to what you get afterwards, "He shall guide you into all truth"?
F.E.R. Yes. If divine rights are let go, you have no security for anything, "If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?" The conclusion you are bound to come to is that there is a God that judgeth in the earth; the moral foundations of God -- that is, His moral dealings in connection with the responsibility of men -- are there. If there is no such thing as righteousness, there is no such Being as God; and, of course, if there are no such things as sin and righteousness, there is no such thing as judgment, they are correlative expressions. If these principles are not maintained, it simply puts God out altogether. They are principles which are really consequent upon the existence of God, and if God is a moral Being, and concerns Himself at all about what is going on here in this world, you must recognise sin, and righteousness, and judgment. As a matter of fact, the foundations cannot be destroyed; the righteous may fear it, and they will fear it, but I think you get the sense by the Holy Spirit that the foundations cannot be destroyed. Now I think that became exceedingly important for them to see, and so I can understand what the Lord says to them, "It is expedient for you that I go away". It is useless to go on talking about glorifying Christ, and all that, if you have not got hold of the principles that maintain the rights of God.
Rem. It is all idle.
F.E.R. Yes.
{355}
Ques. Does "He shall glorify me" mean He shall make much of Me?
F.E.R. I think so; it is in taking of Christ's things and showing them to them; they could not know these things as long as Christ was here, it is all dependent upon Christ being with the Father. The burden of the whole of the latter part of the chapter is that Christ is going back to the Father; the Father was with Him as long as He was here upon earth, but now He is about to return to the Father. What I think you get here is the fulfilment of the prayer in @Ephesians 3, "That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith". "He shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you". I think the two passages, in a kind of way, help one another; you comprehend the breadth, and length, and depth, and height.
Ques. And you could not do that if you had not the Spirit?
F.E.R. No; you are strengthened with all might by His Spirit in the inner man, that the Christ might dwell in your hearts by faith, and then it is that you may comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height. This passage contemplates that really -- the result that would be brought about by the coming of the Comforter.
Rem. Is not this more what is wrought in us by the power of the Spirit? I mean, you could not get these things simply by the letter of Scripture, but by the power of the Holy Spirit.
F.E.R. Quite so; you could not get anything from the letter, you could not understand anything in that way; the letter comes in to teach you what you have got already. You have really got the thing, but then the scripture comes in to show you what you have got.
Ques. So it is really what the Spirit will effect in us?
F.E.R. Yes; it is not reading it down in the scripture
{356}
simply, but divine teaching consequent upon the coming of the Comforter.
Ques. And the same in connection with the demonstration?
F.E.R. Yes, all was dependent upon the coming of the Comforter; it is effectuated in those who have the Comforter -- "He continues with you, and shall be in you". It is all the effect of the presence and coming of the Comforter. I think we look too much upon it that the Comforter came as Christ came, but the coming of the Comforter was in contrast to Christ's coming. He was not manifested as Christ was, He was not presented to men; the coming of the Comforter is in this way -- "He continues with you, and shall be in you". He is *in* you, and so everything that comes with the Comforter would be subjective in you.
Ques. While the Lord Himself was here He was apart from them?
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. But now the Spirit is one with us in a certain sense?
F.E.R. Yes. In one way the Lord presented a very great deal to men in general; but the Comforter has nothing to say to the world; the Lord says, "If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin".
Ques. What would be the effect on the world of the Comforter being here in the believer?
F.E.R. He enables believers to maintain moral principles, those principles which give God a place here on earth. If these were maintained, there would be great power morally, although I think the presence of the Holy Spirit would not be recognised by the world. The demonstration is appreciated by those who have the Holy Spirit, but still it is a demonstration which the world cannot gainsay. Now the philosopher wants to get rid of everything absolute, and you can get nothing absolute unless you bring
{357}
God in. Everything else, if God is not brought in, must be according to the traditions of men, after the rudiments of the world. You cannot get anything absolutely certain -- no certain principles of right and wrong, unless you bring God in.
Rem. The chief Person is left out.
F.E.R. Yes, they leave out the chief Person; you cannot have such ideas as sin and righteousness absolutely unless you bring God in. Man will not tolerate the idea of these things today.
Rem. And yet many a man will be careful to be strictly honest and that sort of thing.
F.E.R. Yes, while it is advantageous to him. It is on the principle of "the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people" -- but if you take men, though there are a great many who are upright men, who would go in for honesty and all that because it is advantageous to them, yet they will not tolerate the idea of sin, as we understand it. It appears to me that the principles which are brought out here are of the very last moment to us, if we are to stand here in the world; unless they have their place in the heart and conscience the foundations will be destroyed, and the world will overpower you. Now the bulk of the men of the world reject the idea of sin, as we understand it; they would admit such a thing as evil, but sin, as we understand it, they would reject altogether. It is only a question of expediency with them, but there is no real standard of right and wrong if God is left out. But I do not believe, you know, that so long as the Holy Spirit is here, and these principles are maintained in the power of the Holy Spirit, that the world could overthrow them. You are to be in the power of the Spirit, and the demonstration is in the presence of the Spirit; but you are only conscious of the demonstration as you are in the power of the Holy Spirit, and I do not believe that the world could overthrow that. But I believe that when the Holy Spirit is gone
{358}
away, then the foundations will really be destroyed.
Ques. At present He still lets (@2 Thessalonians 2: 7)?
F.E.R. Yes, and He lets in this way -- He hinders in that He is here to maintain these principles. It is the overthrowing of the foundations that really brings down the judgment of God; I think you can very well understand what an awful moment it will be to stand in -- the moment of temptation that will come upon the world to try them that are upon the earth -- it will be an awful moment to stand in that day. The demonstration to the world is in the saints. The Holy Spirit does not come to the world as Christ did; He brings demonstration to the world by those who are outside of it, and I think it is a great advantage to the world in that way, because, where people are affected by it, and they are, they may be really gathered out of the world.
Ques. These are really very great moral questions -- as to sin, and righteousness, and judgment?
F.E.R. Yes; and you can see the great importance of giving even children a sense of sin and of righteousness; nothing can be more important to my mind in the training of children. I have no doubt that the great effort today is to get rid of absolute truths, because they flow from what God is; but if there is no God who takes account of things, then there is no such thing as sin, and if there is no sin, there is no righteousness -- they all hang, in that way, upon one another.
Ques. "Ye see me no more" -- who are referred to there?
F.E.R. Oh, I think it is that He is no longer seen in a general way. The great thought is this: righteousness comes out in this way, that there is a place with the Father; you know, I very much doubt if it has anything to do with Christ personally there; it is that righteousness has been established, has been vindicated, so that there is a place with the Father.
{359}
Rem. And for others as well.
F.E.R. Exactly; and that is what comes out in the latter part of the chapter; it was not only a personal question of His going to the Father, but He goes there really as having secured a place for the company. I do not think it was what was personal to Him so much; it is as having secured a place for the company -- for others.
Rem. He goes there representatively.
F.E.R. Yes, in that way, "I go to prepare a place for you". The Lord here gives the disciples the greatest possible encouragement to go to the Father. He had not before pressed upon them to go to the Father in quite that way; they were to go freely to the Father. It was really the consequence of His going to the Father.
Ques. It was not like the petition in the prayer, "Our Father which art in heaven"?
F.E.R. No; everything is altered in this chapter. He went to the Father, and if He went there, there was a place there for them. He went there, as you say, representatively.
Ques. Is righteousness established here?
F.E.R. Well, you see in this verse how righteousness works; you cannot have a place here in this world, because the world is convicted of sin -- there is no place for the saint here, and you must have a place somewhere, so He goes to the Father, as having secured a place for you with the Father. There is no footing for you here, and really you find that righteousness is with the Father.
Ques. Is there no sense in which we have to do with the "heavenly Father"?
F.E.R. Well, I think there is a way in which we are regarded of the Father as to our pathway down here, "Your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things". Of course, we have our heavenly privileges, but then we are still down here upon earth,
{360}
and I think He takes account of our circumstances in that sense. The point here is to give the disciples the fullest possible access to the Father, because He Himself was with the Father when He was here upon earth, and the Father was with Him, as He says, "Ye ... shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me". Now He goes to the Father, and the great idea is to give them a place with the Father, too.
Rem. Not in the same way as they prayed, "Our Father which art in heaven"?
F.E.R. Well, "heavenly Father" in that way suggests distance; it looks as if the Father were at a distance. And yet you know people think one very irreverent for not using it. The desires in the "Lord's prayer" are, like everything else coming from Him, so good that it would be presumption on our part to discuss them, but that does not justify the use of the prayer now in its formal character. It was clearly never intended to be used in this way. "Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" -- every godly soul desires that. "Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us" -- that is governmentally true, and fully applicable, in that sense, to ourselves. Then there is another petition, "Lead us not into temptation" -- which is a prayer that it would be very well for anyone to make; do not let us get into circumstances for which we are not able -- like Peter in the high priest's palace. It would have been better for him to have been outside. But the prayer, as a whole, is not suitable to those who have the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit having come, and Christ having given us the Comforter, and access to the Father through Him, any kind of formality is unsuitable to such a position.
Rem. "If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous".
F.E.R. Yes, there is the righteous One with the
{361}
Father, but not only so, but righteousness is there too. Christ being there is the proof and expression that righteousness has been vindicated; and I believe He has gone there representatively. God "made him to be sin for us ... that we might be made the righteousness of God in him", we get a place with the Father.
Ques. Then it is no question of righteousness when a divine Person goes back to the Father?
F.E.R. That is all bad, root and branch -- that is a bad contention.
Ques. It really maintains the man here?
F.E.R. Yes, that lies at the bottom of it all, but it is not a holy contention.
Ques. But you do link righteousness with *our* place?
F.E.R. Righteousness in Scripture is correlative to sin -- we are in sin, and if you are going to have a place in the holiest, you must have that place in consistency with the righteousness of God, just because we have been in sin. There is another expression which has been given utterance to, that "God was indebted to a man for His glory". Now I think that is a very objectionable expression. God takes very good care to maintain His own glory.
Rem. I must say I have never liked it, either.
F.E.R. God can maintain His own glory and vindicate His own glory independently altogether of man. Of course the expression has been used innocently enough, I have no doubt, but if you come to examine it, it does not give you a true idea of things. What could He do *as Man that He did not do as Son*?
Rem. The question has never been raised between the Father and the Son.
F.E.R. No; I have no doubt in my own mind that, in taking up things, in undertaking to do the will of God, the Lord entered fully into all that sin meant on the part of God -- that He entered fully into all that sin was obnoxious to. I think it very much
{362}
better, instead of having to work it out in such a roundabout way, to say God is *indebted to Himself* for His glory, and that His own Son came forth to secure His glory. Now the way Scripture puts it is that having made purgation of sins, *He* "*sat down* on the right hand of the Majesty on high". It was that *He* -- "being the effulgence of his glory, and the expression of his substance" -- "set himself down".
Rem. I fear we have all been a little guilty as to it.
F.E.R. Well, then, do let us get out of it now.
Rem. You must not lose sight of the One who came, "Lo, *I* come". *Who* is it comes?
F.E.R. Righteousness is for us, because righteousness is correlative to sin; and that is why you get the expression, "new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness". You would not have had that said unless there had been an old heaven and an old earth, in which sin had resided. That is the way Scripture states it. The fact is, the longer I go on, the *less* difficult I find it to understand the statements of Scripture, and the *more* difficulty I have in understanding the moulds in which man casts it. Men attempt to safeguard the truth by casting it into all sorts of moulds, but they will not protect the truth in that way, and it is man's way of casting it that is the difficulty to my mind.
Well, I think that what we get here really results in Christ dwelling in our hearts by faith; you are to be prepared for testimony, and this chapter really gives you the preparation for it -- the Christ dwelling in your heart by faith.
Rem. I think that Ephesians throws a very great deal of light upon this chapter, I had not seen it so before.
F.E.R. It has often been spoken of. Now the first preparation for testimony is the maintenance of the principles that give God His place; you have not any real power for testimony unless these are maintained.
{363}
If you approach the world, or attempt to stand down here, you need to have a very real sense of these principles. Infidelity to my mind is a terrible thing, it is the giving up of all principle -- of all right principle -- it has no principles really.
Rem. The gospel really maintains the righteousness of God.
F.E.R. Yes; in the gospel it is in regard to sin; God's righteousness is vindicated. "He shall glorify me" -- that is, in the heart of the disciples, they were to see the breadth and length and depth and height -- that is the whole range of the Father's purposes of love established in the Son -- that is the idea of it. You know, it is not an easy thing, in the midst of this world, to maintain that everything belongs to Christ, you want to have on the whole armour of God for that. I do not think you will find people very much prepared to allow that.
You see all these chapters are *progressive*. The great truth in chapter 14 is the coming of the Comforter, and Christ going to the Father; then in chapter 15 it brings in that there must not be any flaw in the company, the company itself must be right; and then in chapter 16 you get the Christ dwelling in your hearts by faith. You could not properly have testimony unless all was right in the company; it was of all moment that all should be right with them, that they should be morally a continuation of Christ here -- that is the great point in chapter 15; then in chapter 16 He glorifies Christ, the Christ dwells in your heart by faith, "He shall take of mine and shall shew it unto you".
Ques. What is the difference between the thought of the "Spirit of truth", as here, and the Spirit in Ephesians?
F.E.R. I think the expression "Spirit of truth" is limited to John, you do not get it elsewhere; it is in contrast to the letter of truth. People do no good who
{364}
have only got the letter of the scripture, it is the Spirit of truth that you want. "The Lord is that Spirit" -- that is the Spirit of Scripture, not the letter of it; they were made "able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the Spirit". Truth is what may be known of God, that is the idea, and the Spirit is the principle of it, not the letter. You really get all that may be known of God by the Spirit; the love of God is not shed abroad in our hearts by the Scriptures but by the Spirit. It is the Spirit of truth that will guide you into all truth -- into the whole, complete, entire revelation of God, and God's will, that is what I understand by God's truth. Mr. Darby used to say that if a man went along the streets with a perambulator, he would not do much damage, but if he went along with a steam engine, he might do very much.
Ques. What are we to gather from that?
F.E.R. Well, that when a man talks about his own things, that is like his going along with a perambulator, it is within his own control; but if he has a steam engine, that is something infinitely beyond his own strength.
You see the Lord makes the greatest possible point, in the latter part of the chapter, of His going to the Father, in its bearing and importance for them; it was all an enigma to them, they did not understand the "little while" at all, nor what it was that He said, "Because I go to the Father" -- but He knew they were desirous to ask Him, and He goes on to show them, "The world shall rejoice" and "ye shall weep and lament ... but your sorrow shall be turned into joy" -- it will be a great day for you when I go to the Father; it is a great day for us, too.
Rem. They would weep because He would go away from them.
F.E.R. Yes, but that really ushers in another day. "I go to the Father", and they would learn that by one Spirit they too had access to Him. Their sorrow
{365}
was because He told them He was going away, but the joy was that they found that they could go to the Father, they had the benefit of the Spirit, and the great benefit, too, of access by Him to the Father; they went to where Christ went -- because He was there they could go there also.
Ques. Why is this figure used of the woman?
F.E.R. Well, because everything is changed when the child is born -- the anguish is over and all is changed; and it would be a very different thing for them to know Him with the Father, compared with what they had known of Him as a Man down here -- despised, and scorned, and denied, and all that kind of thing.
Ques. And it is a man of a new order that is born?
F.E.R. Quite so.
Rem. "And your joy no man taketh from you".
F.E.R. Yes, we read in the Acts, they "were filled with joy, and with the Holy Spirit".
Ques. Was the first "little while" from the time that He was then speaking until His death?
F.E.R. Yes, until His death; He will not give them the idea that He continued with them. It was "a little while" because He went to the Father; you cannot over-estimate the importance of that statement, "Because I go to the Father". It was a statement of the very greatest importance for them, and not only in regard of them, but for us too. When the Lord Himself was here, He had the Father with Him, as He said, "The Father is with me".
Rem. He changed their entire position and gave them a new home?
F.E.R. Exactly. I think that if you get the conception of what the Lord intended to leave here -- a company ready for the Holy Spirit, and that loved one another as He had loved them -- if it were possible to conceive such a company, and then that they were the vessel of His testimony here, you would see how
{366}
important it was for them to know that He went to the Father so that they might have a place there too. And all this was brought about -- it is folly to say it never was fulfilled -- it *was* fulfilled. You could not have it now, of course; we suffer from the weakness and ruin of things, but the great point for us is *fidelity* -- fidelity to Christ; you cannot have what was at the beginning, it cannot be restored; but what you can have is personal fidelity to Christ, and to what was at the beginning; you want to be satisfied with nothing short of that.
Rem. You do get the fulfilment of this in @Acts 2.
F.E.R. Yes. The Lord always addressed Himself to the company, not to individuals, in the Revelation. In the addresses to the seven churches He in every instance addresses the company. If man has failed, God has not failed; He speaks to a thousand generations, and when you come to the New Testament the Lord speaks to the church right along to all the generations of the church, but all through He addresses Himself to the company.
Rem. It could only be realised in the company.
Ques. So you would expect a company right on to the end?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. I look for a company, and for fellowship, right on to the end. The Lord gives us the ground for such an expectation in His addresses to the seven churches. "He that hath an ear" -- a circumcised ear -- will clearly be found listening to the voice of the Spirit in the churches until the Lord comes.
Now the Lord says here, "I say not unto you that I will pray the Father for you: for the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me" -- there could be nothing more touching than that; I will not pray for you, you must pray for yourselves, for the Father Himself loveth you. I do not expect they would pray for much as long as the Lord was here with them, I
{367}
think they left all the praying to Him, but now they were to pray.
Ques. They went to Him, I suppose, for everything when He was here?
F.E.R. I should think so; but now He says, "Ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full". The Lord knew everything that was coming to pass for them, and all that was before Himself. He knew that they would receive the promise of the Father, the Comforter; they had lacked nothing while He was with them, but now He was going to the Father.
Ques. What about "Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name"?
F.E.R. They had depended wholly and entirely upon Him, I should say. I think Christ had the most wonderful influence upon them, they had contemplated His glory, and no doubt they were very greatly affected by it -- it was overwhelming.
Ques. And He commended their love?
F.E.R. Quite so, He controlled everything while here; even persecution and the enemy were held back during the time of His public ministry. After the temptation, we read that Satan departed from Him for a season; he comes in at the beginning and again at the close of His pathway.
Rem. I have sometimes thought had it not been so, the poor woman would have been turned out of Simon's house.
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. Is there any record in the Acts of the Apostles of their asking anything of the Father?
F.E.R. I do not think so; you see little is recorded but what was in connection with the public testimony; the Spirit of God only records what bears on that.
Rem. He gives us, too, Christ's place of supremacy as Lord?
F.E.R. Yes, there is full testimony to Him as Lord; the Holy Spirit was testimony to that, and
{368}
then the testimony of the twelve was to that -- that was the burden of their testimony.
I think the Lord wants us to understand that righteousness has given us a place with the Father; you have no place in this world, but you have access to the Father by one Spirit, so that you may freely come to Him; the power of the Holy Spirit is all exercised in that direction. The Father Himself loveth you; if you love, it is because you come under the Father's love.
Ques. Because you see Him as the Object of the Father's love?
F.E.R. Quite so. The Lord effected a very great deal in principle when He was down here; He passed out of the world almost in solitude, but in principle He had effected a great deal; you cannot judge by appearances, but the foundation was all laid; righteousness was established, and the foundation all laid for the accomplishment of God's counsels, and a company prepared for the coming of the Holy Spirit -- a small company, perhaps, but still a company prepared for the Holy Spirit and where He could work freely.
Rem. As you sometimes say in connection with resurrection, if you have one man risen from the dead, it is as good as one thousand.
F.E.R. Quite so. Christianity is all the outcome of that little company, and you look abroad in the world and see what the effect of Christianity has been. We should have nothing but barbarism apart from Christianity. What about benevolence and mercy and all these things -- they have all followed in the line of Christianity; they are not found outside of it. Apart from Christianity there is nothing but heathenism and darkness. But now that men have got the benefits of Christianity they want to tell you it is no better than Buddhism, but it is the greatest impudence to come and tell us that the dark things outside Christianity are equal to Christianity itself.
{369}
I was thinking whether we might not get a little more from the latter part of the chapter as to the characteristics of "that day". The Lord speaks in verse 23 of "that day", that is, the day in which we live, and therefore it is important for us to understand, if we can, something of the characteristics of this day. You get the same expression in chapter 14: 20, "At that day ye shall know". Here it is, "In that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you". It is another day, the present day.
Rem. In both cases the expression follows on the coming of the Comforter.
F.E.R. Well, I think there is *this* distinction -- all that comes out in the latter part of chapter 16 is consequent upon His going to the Father, but in chapter 14 it is consequent upon the coming of the Comforter. They are the two sides of the one day; here you have all that was involved in His being with the Father, that which would characterise that day really, and then the other side of it is all that is involved in the Spirit being here.
Rem. Is it not connected too with the access which we have to the Father?
F.E.R. Well, that is included in His being with the Father. He has gone to the Father really on man's account; it was not very wonderful that He Himself should go to the Father, there is no difficulty about that, the extraordinary thing is that He should go to the Father on our account. There would be a difficulty for them, but there was no difficulty for Him. It was nothing wonderful for Him to go there, but the difference was what that day would be for them. "In that day ye shall ask me nothing" -- that day was for them, not exactly for Him.
Ques. What is the meaning of "Ye shall ask me nothing"?
F.E.R. Because they would know everything. In
{370}
chapter 14 He says, "At that day ye shall *know*". That indicated the great change that was coming to pass. The Father was veiled to them as long as Christ was here, and they asked everything of Christ -- they knew He was in the secret, but they were not, and so they asked everything of Him; when He brings in that day, He is going to the Father, and then they will not need to ask anything of Him, they will *know*.
Ques. What is "in my name"?
F.E.R. He was with the Father for them, and they were for Him in the world, and therefore they asked in His name. I think they are two distinct thoughts. I think it is more asking about anything, not quite so much prayer.
Ques. The word used for "ask the Father", in the same verse, is different, is it not?
F.E.R. Yes, the first word is the word 'demand', and the other to ask a person so-and-so.
The apostles are looked at as being representative here, but the Lord is opening up the characteristics of that day -- what a day it would be. I think if you only had chapter 14 you would not have it complete, you would only have one side; you would have the company down here with the Comforter, and the Comforter abiding with them, and even Christ coming to them, but, to complete the circle of the truth, you must have the other side -- Christ with the Father, and they asking Him nothing because they would know all.
Rem. They would be with Him in the Father's presence?
F.E.R. Yes; they would not have occasion to ask Him anything, because they would be with Him in the full light of the Father, and on the other hand, *for* Him here in this world. When Christ was here, the words of the Father, and the works of the Father, were all set forth in Him, but man was not with the Father. The fact is, what the Lord had said to them in
{371}
chapter 14 was inexplicable to them, or they would not have said, "Shew us the Father". In their sense of things the Father was not seen, but at that day, the day to which the Lord refers in this chapter, everything would be completely altered because He was going to the Father. He did not go exactly on His own account, because He was perfectly able to go to the Father -- He went where He came from -- but the extraordinary thing was that He could go to the Father on our account, and that introduces "that day" down here, it is this day. You see, the fact is this -- though I do not want anyone to misunderstand me -- when Christ came into this world He came alone, but when He went back to the Father He took the church, in principle, with Him. Of course it was not at all then worked out, but that was the real meaning of His going back to the Father, He really carried back with Him what He came to seek -- He came to seek the church, and in one sense He carried the church back with Him.
Rem. And therefore He could say, "It is expedient for you that I go away".
F.E.R. Quite so. Take @Hebrews 12, "Who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame" -- what do you understand by the "joy" there? Why, it was the church, He carried the church back with Him.
Rem. And it refers to the church in @Hebrews 2, where it says, "Behold I and the children which God hath given me".
F.E.R. Yes; the fact is He came into the world to seek the pearl of great price, and He carried that pearl right up to where He Himself came from -- that is the idea to me in the joy set before Him; it was to that end He endured the cross, despising the shame; He came into our place, and He carried us back to His place. The joy, I believe, is connected with the pearl of great price.
{372}
Rem. He did not go back empty-handed.
F.E.R. No; the cross was our place, it is the actual cross, the place of crucifixion, but He came right down into our place that He might carry the church back with Him to His place, and for that He despised the shame, coming into the place of shame and contempt down here. He came into that -- but it was for the joy of taking the church back to the Father. He endured the cross, despising the shame, it was the shame of the cross -- I think the connection is perfectly intelligible -- He comes into our place that He might carry us into His place. He was going to carry up there what He had secured down here.
Rem. He would have carried nothing back on the ground of His pathway?
F.E.R. Oh, no; He comes down into death that He might secure the church. The cross, in a certain sense, was the greatest expression of shame and ignominy.
Rem. And the place of the greatest expression of love.
Ques. What is the "fulness of joy" in @Psalm 16?
F.E.R. He knew that perfectly well because He had come from that; He had been accustomed to that presence where there is fulness of joy; but in @Hebrews 12 it was for the joy set before Him, something more definite. Christ could speak about the joys at God's right hand, for the simple reason that He knew them.
Ques. But the pathway for man there was through death -- "Thou wilt shew me the path of life".
F.E.R. Yes, but you could not put that as a necessity for the Lord Himself; it was so for man, and if He had not gone that way there could have been no way there for us. That is the reason for His going back to the Father in this latter part of chapter 16. He goes to the Father that He might make a place there for us; He only could do that. The Father was with Him in all His pathway down here, but there was
{373}
no proper place for us with the Father. The disciples did not understand His going to the Father at all.
Ques. And that is where the question of righteousness comes in?
F.E.R. Quite so.
Ques. Does it not give us the new order of things here in the Man-child born?
F.E.R. Yes; they could not have to do with the Father in the old condition. As was said just now, "that day" is characterised by two things, Christ's being with the Father, and the presence of the Comforter here -- it is the side of Christ being with the Father that is taken up in chapter 16.
Ques. Is there any connection between the Man-child caught up to the throne of God in @Revelation 12 and what we have here?
F.E.R. Well, there is a connection, but not a very apparent one. You cannot put it too literally, but you get the idea here, I think.
Rem. Their joy was all in connection with the fact of His going to the Father?
F.E.R. Yes; they were to be privileged to be where He went. Now this is where the difference comes in between John's gospel and the others. The other gospels bring out *grace*, but John's gospel brings out *life*. The point in John is not the question of grace at all, or the benefits you get through Christ -- peace with God, and favour, and even the gift of the Holy Spirit -- but when you come to the question of life, you have the full and complete expression of God's mind in regard to us, and you do not get that in connection with grace. Grace is founded on the sacrifice; there is a sacrifice adequate, and we get the benefit through Christ, through His sacrifice. But when you come to the question of life, you have the complete setting forth in Christ -- in His death and resurrection, and even, too, in where He is now -- of
{374}
God's mind in regard of us. He is "the true God, and eternal life" -- because He is the expression of God's mind in regard of us.
Rem. And grace, as in the other gospels, is worldwide, whereas, in that way, life only comes to those who are in the circle, so to speak.
F.E.R. Quite so. The ground of his statements is that in Christ there is the complete expression of God's mind in regard to us, "In whom also ye are circumcised" -- that is really the cross, and the cross was God's mind in regard of us. Then, too, it says, "In him ye are filled full [complete]" (@Colossians 2: 10). We get in Christ the expression of God's mind in regard to us, and God would have us complete, so that we do not turn to anything of man's mind, or anything of that sort. "In whom also ye are risen with him" -- the resurrection of Christ is the expression of God's thoughts with regard to us, and the same is equally true of eternal life; Christ is the full and complete expression, both in death and in resurrection, and even in ascension, of the mind of God with regard to us. I think there is a great deal of difference in that way between grace, that is, what you get *through* Christ, and what is set before you *in* Christ -- the full expression of the thought and mind of God in regard to His people. And therefore we have to *come* to everything, we have to come to crucifixion, so that you can say, "I am crucified with Christ" -- God has set that forth in the crucifixion of Christ. Christ had to come to it in fact, but I come to it in mind. Then Christ was raised from the dead by the power of God -- well, I have got to come to that, too, in mind. Then the same thing comes out with regard to His going to the Father, we see in Him the setting forth of the Father's mind with regard to us, that we should have a place with the Father. "This is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent".
{375}
Ques. So you would read "in whom" in @Colossians 2, where we have "wherein"?
F.E.R. I think the expression is used twice. You get the same thing coming out in @Ephesians 1, the whole chapter is the expression of the mind of God with regard to us in Christ. We are "blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places *in Christ*"; then He has "chosen us *in him* before the foundation of the world", and we are "accepted *in the beloved*", so that there is the complete setting forth, *in Christ*, of God's mind for us, added to which it is said, "*in whom* we have redemption".
Ques. Is it in Him then that we are risen?
F.E.R. Yes. If any one were to say that we were risen in ourselves, we should repudiate the idea altogether. You are risen in the apprehension of God's mind for you, you have apprehended the mind of God in raising Him from the dead; it is not simply that you should be freed from Egypt and tread the wilderness, but His pleasure is that you should be in association with Him beyond Jordan; the latter is a moral necessity, because if you are brought to God the world must become a wilderness to you.
Rem. All that we get through Christ is, in a way, for earth?
F.E.R. Well, it is our side. I think there are plenty of people in the world who apprehend the benefits that they get through Christ and His sacrifice, but who do not see that God has been pleased to set forth fully and perfectly in Christ what His mind is for His people. As to the scripture in Colossians, I think it is a continuation, a succession of thoughts as to Him; and baptism is only brought in in connection with circumcision, you just come back to your baptism -- very likely with a long interval between. Many people are baptised, long, long before they know the significance of baptism, and then, too, they never come back to it until they have got circumcision; you
{376}
must accept what God has expressed in the death and resurrection of Christ, it is an *infinite* and perfect expression of God's thought. I tell you honestly, I am not content merely with the benefits that I have got through the death of Christ, they are of all-importance to me down here, but I see that there is the perfect expression in the death and resurrection of Christ of God's mind in regard to me, and I will go on to that.
Rem. The first is an absolute necessity for everyone.
F.E.R. Yes; it is just the difference between Luke and John. In Luke you get, "Thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem" -- it is the grace of God having Jerusalem as its starting-point, but going out to the whole earth. That is Luke's thought, it is the effect of the sacrifice, and no one could do without it.
Rem. The one is God meeting our need, and the other God satisfying His own heart.
F.E.R. Exactly; and the importance of it is that when you have received light, you see that you have come to this point, that "I am crucified with Christ"; you have to come to it in mind, not in fact. The apostle had come to it in mind; he says, "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me".
Rem. I suppose the idea here in @John 16: 21 is that the Man of the new order brings in the joy?
F.E.R. Exactly, because it was the expression of the Lord's mind in regard of them, and it ushers in that day of which the Lord speaks. You see what a wonderful thing it is, "In that day ye shall ask me nothing" -- you do not want to demand of Him, for you are in the place; if people do ask Christ for this or that, it shows they are not very conscious of being in the place. Take, for example, a family, and I mean
{377}
a family where things are as they should be, where the children are enjoying the love of the parents, and loving one another; well, you do not get one child asking another about the parents, each child knows the parents for itself; and you are in the Father's presence with the Father, and there you do not even ask Christ anything in that sense.
Rem. You would be lacking in personal knowledge of the Father if you asked anything.
F.E.R. Well, I think it would indicate that. Then, lower down, you get, "At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you: for the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God" -- I think we are actually left here in this world to be representatives of Christ, and therefore they ask in His name.
Rem. "In my name" carries the thought of His interests, does it not?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so; and we would get anything that tended to promote Christ; whatever we ask that tends to promote Christ I think we should get, anything else would not be asking in His name. You see, you are asking in His name. If a man went and asked God to give him a better situation, that would not be asking in Christ's name.
Rem. "In that day ye shall ask me nothing" -- I suppose that, in the assembly properly, we should be conscious of that?
F.E.R. I think so. I think that if you are with Him in the Father's presence, you do not ask Him for anything, you are really in the scene and oracle yourself. I do not think it means that you do not address Him, that is not the idea, but you do not ask Him anything.
Rem. "The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended".
F.E.R. Well, quite so. You know, I cannot
{378}
imagine anything more wonderful effected by Christ than that He went back to the Father, and, in principle, carried those few poor men with Him. It was a very wonderful thing that He could have them right there. He could carry a little company of men, on the one hand, into the presence of the Father with Himself, and on the other, that little company could be descriptive of Himself down here. I think people might be astonished, I daresay many have been, at the small outward effect of the Lord's ministry on earth; the apparent effect was very small, but in principle, the effect was very great indeed.
Rem. Though the Lord Himself was the Sower, yet only one seed fell into good ground; you would have expected that it would all have brought forth much fruit.
F.E.R. Yes. I think people ought to be greatly encouraged if they could but see the place of Christ with the Father, if you could but get people to understand at all the import of "that day". But there would not be very much to see; conversion is a far more showy work; you would never hear of this kind of work; it is a silent kind of thing, it does not show on the surface.
Rem. But there would be eternal results.
F.E.R. Yes. Well, what value is there to be attached to "brethren"? Whatever it is, it is the result of Mr. Darby's work -- whatever there may be bound up with them is the result of his work; the effect of his work remains, and I would venture to ask this, what would the gospel be worth in the present day except for "brethren"? You may say it is making a good deal of "brethren", but I ask, what would gospel preaching be?
Ques. What is the answer to that?
F.E.R. Well, I say, look outside, and see what it is worth there. Outside they have largely given up the truth, and even those who are converted make no
{379}
break with the world, they do not come out in testimony; they are all formed on the model of those who have been blessed to them, they all go on that line, but there is no real spiritual vigour in it.
Rem. Is the Man in glory preached outside?
F.E.R. Well, I would go lower down than that, I do not believe the bulk of preachers give their converts light -- the light of God.
Ques. Because they have not got it?
F.E.R. I do not know at all.
Ques. What would you say is the object of the gospel?
F.E.R. Well, the object of the gospel, if I understand it at all, is that God may be known in the heart of man, and the work of the gospel is not done until that is brought about.
Ques. If you get peace with God, how do you know it?
F.E.R. Because the scripture says you have peace with God; but the true scripture idea of it is really that you are in the light of God, and of His mind in the resurrection of Christ; God has set forth His mind in regard to man, and you learn that He has nothing to say to man but peace, and you have reached His mind.
Ques. And in that way you are at home with God?
F.E.R. Quite so. There are many devout Christians who would answer an anxious soul in that way.
Rem. The difficulty in the preaching of the gospel is that it does not succeed in bringing people to God; they are told that they believe when they really do not, and so they do not get the good of Christianity.
Ques. Has not the gospel been made a means of relieving man rather than of reaching God?
F.E.R. To a very large extent, I should say.
"The hour is coming that I will no longer speak to you in allegories, but will declare to you openly concerning the Father. In that day ye shall ask in my
{380}
name". I think it is a wonderful thing to think that the Lord would announce to them plainly of the Father.
Rem. Is that not exactly on the same lines as when He said, "I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God"?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so; He announced to them plainly of the Father, so that they stood now in direct relationship with the Father.
Ques. Was it the thought of His taking them back to the Father when He spoke to Mary?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so; and then He breathes on them and says, "Receive ye the Holy Spirit", so that everything that was not of the Holy Spirit had to go.
Rem. It is as last Adam here?
F.E.R. Yes; people seem to have very great difficulty in apprehending the truth of another Man -- but what man is there with Christ? Is man in the flesh associated with Him? If you are to be associated with Christ, depend upon it there must be another man; no mere reformation will fit you for association with Christ. You must be after *His* order, and He is another Man. It is certainly not the old man, but another man, and a different man. The man formed is in the presence of the Father with Christ; it is another man formed on entirely new principles. I am surprised at the difficulty that people make of such a thing. I fancy, too, that the first man is gone for God, that the first man has been removed for God in the death of Christ. I do not think that one need say the old man, but the first man. No doubt there are certain relationships, and so on, connected with the first man that are recognised of God, so long as He goes on with His dispensational dealings on the earth, but that does not alter the fact to my mind that the first man has gone, that the cross is the end of that man. The proper answer to the cross is the new heavens and the new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness --
{381}
where there is no trace of the old man left, that order of man is gone.
Ques. And is not God occupied now with displacing all that is left in us of that man?
F.E.R. Yes; but the argument that they bring up is that there are certain relationships and things still recognised of God, human relationships and so on -- and God will own what is of Himself in that way. But really for Him, and for the accomplishment of His counsels, the first man is gone, and even these relationships now are to be carried out in the power of the Spirit, not simply on the ground of the flesh.
Rem. You come back to the old thing in a new way.
F.E.R. Well, of course, man must go on with these relationships and so on, but if you have come into the mind of God, that you are risen with Christ, you have to put off the old man, and to put on the new, and Scripture distinctly states that in Christ Jesus there is neither male nor female.
Rem. In @Romans 6 it says, "Our old man is crucified with him".
F.E.R. Well, that is the moral thing, I have no doubt at all. Male and female exist now, and will through the millennium, but Christ has brought to pass another order of things, and another order of man, in which there is neither male nor female. I think there is a sort of effort to save the old man to a certain extent, but what I see is that I am placed in certain relationships -- I may be a father or a husband -- and I accept it; but all these claims I carry out "to the Lord", I do not take them up on natural ground. I am in them just for the moment for the will of God, but in another sense I am out of them already. If I am with God, I am out of them.
Rem. So far as you enter into what it is to be "in Christ" you are outside them.
F.E.R. Quite so. All these things will come in
{382}
under the law in the millennium, but even in the millennium they will only be transitory. In the new heavens and new earth the whole thing will be gone, you will have nothing left but what is of Christ, and in Christ. The Lord entered into these things, and yet who could say that He was not the Man out of heaven -- the second Man from heaven? Yet He was born of a woman, made under law, but He was, all the same, the Man out of heaven, living bread that came down out of heaven.
Rem. The purpose of God is to take people out of the world, and therefore the world as such is condemned.
F.E.R. Well, the great end of redemption is that the Spirit of God should be given to man. It is the Spirit of another man, the Spirit of God's Son, but it is the great object of the work of redemption that the Spirit shall be communicated, just as, in the old order of things, the man was sprinkled with the blood, then he was anointed with the oil. So the same One who takes away the sin of the world baptises with the Holy Spirit. Whatever the Spirit touches, in that way, is made *new*.
I think it is a wonderful expression, "I shall shew to you plainly of the Father"; the Lord seems to contemplate that they will still be in His company: "In that day ye shall ask me nothing" -- but they were to ask of the Father, that their joy might be full. The word that is used for "ask" there is not like praying to God in heaven, but really asking of One in whose company you are -- it contemplates that they would be still in His company. In verse 23 it is demanding in that sense, just as I might ask of you, or you of me.
Rem. But in verse 26 it is different, "Ye shall ask in my name".
F.E.R. Yes. Then He goes on to say, "I say not
{383}
to you that I will demand of the Father for you". The word here is the one always used in connection with Christ in John's gospel, He asked as of One present with Him. "Ye shall ask in my name" involves that they were to be here representative and descriptive of Himself; they were to be here in His interests, and not only that, but they were to be here morally representative of Himself -- descriptive of Himself; and therefore they would ask in His name -- it is as though He was here. You know, I do not think that this privilege is used half enough; my firm belief is that if we were set with a single eye on the promotion of Christ here, we should get whatever we asked.
Ques. Is it individual?
F.E.R. Yes, everything is individual in the present day pretty much, on account of the state of the church.
Rem. Mr. Stoney constantly pressed that what you value you get.
F.E.R. I think so. The fact is this, what really comes to pass is that you ask a thing, very often a right thing, long before you are prepared for it. I think I can understand it with regard to myself. The first time I ever thought of being free of occupation for the Lord's work was five-and-thirty years ago. I was set for it, but I have had to wait all these years for it. I believe that what a man is set for he will surely get, perhaps not immediately, but he *will* get it. I believe you get it when you are equal for it. It would be a mistake to give it to you when you are not prepared for it, and God is too good to give it to you. I do not think that we have an idea of the pains God takes with people. Now if you are going to turn any gift that God may have given you to the gratifying of the man that is here -- of yourself -- it would be ruin to you, it would spoil you. But, all the same, I can say that everything I have desired I have got, though often not at the time. We get things when we are
{384}
equal to them. "For the Father himself loveth you".
Ques. Why are the two things linked together, "ye have loved me", and "have believed that I came out from God" (verse 27)?
F.E.R. Well, the two things naturally run together; but I do not think they had faith to say that He came from *the Father*.
Ques. And He declares that to them here?
F.E.R. Yes, He says now, "I came forth from the Father".
Ques. The great test is loving Christ?
F.E.R. Yes, no person could be conscious of loving the Father except as loving Christ; the Father Himself draws to Christ, He draws and attaches you to Christ, and if you love Christ you become conscious of the Father's love. I do not think a person could love the Father apart from Christ. Christ, in that way, is the object of affection, but then you become conscious of the Father's love. I think the disciples were sure that Christ came from God, but that was as far as their faith went. Of course, the Lord had told them, He had stated things to them, but as yet they were little able to apprehend them.
Ques. What is it, "that in me ye might have peace" (verse 33)?
F.E.R. I think it was perfect serenity and undisturbedness of mind. You have perfect serenity and peace in Christ, the peace of Christ; you look at Christ and you see the expression of God's mind in regard of you, that you should be here undisturbed and undistracted. "In me ... peace", there is nothing to harass or disturb.
Very few people, I think, take in the force of the expression, "I have overcome the world" -- the vast majority are still under the power of the world, but the world is not absolutely the master of the situation. "I have overcome the world".
{385}
Ques. Do you not get the peace of Christ in @Matthew 11, when He says, "Even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight"?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
CHAPTER 17
F.E.R. I think one thing comes out in verse 1, and that is, how completely the Son is identified with the condition which He had taken, "Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son"; it proves very distinctly how completely the Person was identified with the condition which He had assumed.
Ques. It proves the glory of the Person, too, does it not?
F.E.R. Yes, the answer to the prayer proves that. It is only from His being in the condition and position of a man down here in humiliation that there could be such utterances.
Ques. You mean such as "Glorify thy Son"?
F.E.R. Yes, "Glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee".
Ques. In resurrection?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. I think that in order that the Father might be glorified the truth of the Son must be declared, and resurrection, in that sense, was the showing forth -- the declaration -- of the truth of the Son, that He was the Son, and one with the Father. "That they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent" -- but He had to be declared and set forth as the Son, one with the Father.
Ques. In what sense has He glorified the Father?
F.E.R. By the accomplishment of the Father's will; by giving effect to the will and counsel of the Father, He glorified the Father. His being glorified is, I suppose, in contrast to His being in humiliation here. He had become man in the position of humiliation
{386}
and weakness here, and in contrast to that He is glorified, but then it shows, too, how completely the Son was identified with the position He had taken, *He even prays that He may be glorified*.
Rem. Though He prays for it, yet He only gets what is His own, and of His own right.
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. But He receives it as given to Him of the Father, in the position which He had taken?
F.E.R. Yes, He was in the position of humiliation and weakness down here, but His present position is the greatest contrast to that -- I mean His position as Man at the right hand of God; the glorious position He is in now is in contrast to all that He had down here, that is certain.
Ques. Here, then, it is not so much the Son of man that is glorified as God's Son?
F.E.R. That is it, "Glorify thy Son".
Ques. And that Son was seen in humiliation by men?
F.E.R. Yes. He took manhood in that way in humiliation, and as in that position there was the possibility of His being glorified.
Rem. It is very beautiful, His prayer that He might be glorified in order that He might glorify the Father.
F.E.R. Yes.
Rem. And He goes on to say, "As thou *hast* given him power over all flesh".
F.E.R. He only takes up that position in resurrection, it is resurrection that sets Him in that position. It is quite clear that one Man, who is risen, is above every other man who is not risen. "To this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living" -- it is resurrection that puts Him in a position suitable to that, having "authority over all flesh".
Rem. If it had been His as Man, it would almost have seemed like sanctioning the first man.
{387}
F.E.R. Yes, but in no sense was that the case, or could be the case. Of course, you could not limit grace, but it would not have been outside death if He had not taken it up in resurrection. If He had not taken up the position in resurrection of giving eternal life to as many as the Father had given Him, it would not have been outside death. Eternal life is in contrast to death.
Ques. "The hour is come" -- is that the hour of Christ's being glorified, or the hour of the cross?
F.E.R. Well, I should think it is the hour of Christ's being glorified.
Rem. "I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do".
F.E.R. I think the Lord prays in anticipation. It is like, "Thou hast given him power over all flesh". It is over *all* flesh, it is not limited at all.
Rem. It is universal dominion?
F.E.R. I think it is more on the line of *headship*, Christ is the head of every man.
Rem. But with a view to the carrying out of counsel?
F.E.R. Yes, it is evidently so here.
Rem. It was pointed out here a few weeks back how constantly you get in John such expressions as in chapter 10, He giveth His life "for the sheep", and here it is that He should give eternal life "to as many as thou hast given him".
F.E.R. Yes, I think that in redemption Christ claims a right over all, but with the object that He might carry out the counsel of the Father -- that is the thing.
Rem. There is a secret purpose in it all.
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. You get the statement with regard to Christ that "the head of every man is Christ", not just of the elect, or of the church, but of every man.
Rem. The Son would glorify the Father by giving
{388}
eternal life to as many as the Father had given Him, and everything is put under Him so that He could do it.
F.E.R. I think so. He is given authority over all flesh that He might give eternal life to as many as the Father had chosen; but, in another point of view, He is given title over all flesh through redemption. "He died for all", @2 Corinthians 5: 15.
Rem. Even there it comes in "that they which live", etc.
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. Here they are given to Him of the Father. Throughout the whole of John's gospel there is never once the idea presented of any kind of competency in man, but just the contrary. The Lord will not trust man, He did not trust those who believed on Him when they saw the miracles that He did. Then it says, "No one can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him". You see, it all goes, from the very outset, on the ground of the world having rejected Christ.
Rem. It starts with it?
F.E.R. Yes; I do not think that anyone could understand John's gospel apart from seeing that. The thing is hopeless, it is all gone as far as the competency of man is concerned.
Rem. It is really what you were saying last Friday, God is one, there is perfect unity between Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
F.E.R. Yes, perfect oneness of mind and purpose; I think that is the idea in God being one. The point in the Old Testament was, there is one God, but the point in the New Testament is God is one, because in the New Testament the light of divine Persons comes out, and therefore the teaching is that God is one.
Ques. Then you would read it that way, "God is one" (@1 Timothy 2)?
F.E.R. Yes; I believe that is the only correct way of reading it. God is one. There is one God,
{389}
there can be no doubt about that; but when the Mediator comes in it has to be emphasised that God is *one*, that is, as before stated, there is perfect oneness of mind and purpose.
Ques. What is @1 Corinthians 8: 6, "To us there is one God, the Father"?
F.E.R. Well, the thought is different there; I think it is in contrast to many gods, and many lords. It says, "There be gods many, and lords many, but to us one God, the Father". There would be no use in the statement there that God is one, it is in contrast to the many gods and many lords.
Rem. I suppose @John 17: 2 refers to those in Christianity, but does not go further?
F.E.R. No, I do not think so. I do not think the prayer goes beyond the church. The prayer is limited to those who are given to Him of the Father all through. Then you see when the Lord comes to speak in verse 3 of eternal life, it is not from Mount Zion where He "commanded the blessing, even life for evermore", but something entirely new. I think the Lord gives the character of eternal life; no one could speak of this verse being a definition of eternal life, but the Lord gives us the character of it.
Rem. And it is the knowledge of God, and of Jesus Christ, His sent One.
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. It is the knowledge of the Father as the only true God, and of Jesus Christ. It is the sense that the only true God is presented to us in the Father, and the Son is presented to us as the sent One; the point in the passage is how divine Persons are presented to us.
Ques. And we are to know God in the relationship of the Father?
F.E.R. Precisely. The Unitarians take up this verse, you see it posted up on their churches, too.
Rem. Of course, because taking it out of its context
{390}
you would make Jesus Christ just the sent One and no more.
F.E.R. But I do not see why, because, after all, it is the Father who is presented as the only true God in that way. It is not only one God, but *the Father* who is the only true God. They refuse the idea of the Father and Son and Spirit; but if they once admit the Father they give up the position.
Ques. If there is a Father, there must be a Son?
F.E.R. Yes; there is no meaning otherwise in the relationship.
Rem. But then what they hold is the universal Fatherhood of God.
F.E.R. Oh, is that it?
Rem. But they do not profess to see the characteristic name of Father.
F.E.R. But it is a curious thing, if you come to take up that position, that Christ was here as a Man. It is a curious thing that He should pray to be glorified, so that He might have authority over all flesh. They could hardly conceive that that belonged to a mere man.
Ques. Not even an unfallen creature could ask to be glorified?
F.E.R. No; and think of any creature having authority to give eternal life; imagine the Father drawing to a man, and that man giving to men eternal life! I think I could understand them if they repudiated the whole of the Scriptures, but to attempt to found their theory upon this scripture is downright wickedness.
Rem. I do not think that modern Unitarians gave any authority to the word of God.
F.E.R. Perhaps not, but they quote it, you know, and they put it up on their churches.
Rem. No one could ever say before, "I have glorified thee on the earth".
F.E.R. No, indeed, exactly the opposite. If they
{391}
had said, "I have dishonoured Thee on the earth", it would have been true.
Ques. Is verse a like the end of Matthew, where the Lord says, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth"
F.E.R. I think that is more dispensational, and that He comes to them there more administratively, so He sends them forth to all nations to baptise. You get there, not "all flesh", but the distinction between Jew and Gentile; here it is simply, "Thou hast given him power over all flesh". Jew and Gentile are merged in "*all* flesh"; and then He has power over all flesh, "that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him". I think the great importance of the way eternal life is spoken of here is that it is presented objectively.
Ques. As something outside your life altogether?
F.E.R. Yes, outside yourself altogether, something that really is apprehended.
Ques. If we have eternal life it is *in Him*?
F.E.R. Yes, it is the gift of God, and it is *in Him*; but to us it is an objective thought, one that the mind apprehends.
Ques. Only we may have the consciousness of having reached it?
F.E.R. Oh, yes; but that is the other side; the thing itself is an objective thought, though there is the work of God that fits us for the apprehension of it.
Ques. So the point in the first epistle is that we "might know"?
F.E.R. Yes, the point there is that we might be conscious; the subjective thought is that you might be *conscious*, but then you are conscious that you have something objectively. You are brought into a certain position and relationship, and there it is that you have eternal life, the knowledge of the only true God -- the Father, and the Son as Jesus Christ the sent One; being brought into the light of that, you are conscious
{392}
that you have eternal life. What is it makes you conscious? What makes you conscious is that you have the power to enjoy what is presented to you, that is the way the consciousness comes. Certain things are presented to me, and they are such a reality to me, that I am conscious that I have eternal life. Certain divine realities are so presented to the soul -- they become such a reality to me, that I am conscious that I have eternal life, but the consciousness springs from what is presented to me.
Rem. I suppose you would say they are apprehended by the Spirit?
F.E.R. They are apprehended by the work of the Spirit. They would not come to you as realities except by the work of the Spirit. These things come to us so as realities that we are conscious that we have come to eternal life.
Rem. As formed in the divine nature one is conscious of eternal life.
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. What makes a man conscious of natural life?
F.E.R. Well, it is natural relationships; intelligent natural life flows from being in certain natural relationships; you are in the affection that flows from these relationships, and the man is occupied with the objects of his affections.
Rem. They make life worth living, as we say?
F.E.R. Yes; a man is made conscious of life by the objects by which he is surrounded. Now the reality of eternal life lies in the reality to you of the Persons who are presented to you, whatever may be the preparation that enables you to enter into it.
Rem. You are pressing that thought to correct the thought that we used to have that eternal life was in us?
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. What is the force of "Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent"?
{393}
F.E.R. You have not got the full declaration of His being the sent One except as glorified; it is His being glorified that testifies to it. It is His place at the right hand of God, it is His having gone back to the Father, that is the proof and declaration that He is the sent One of the Father.
Rem. He is declared to be the Son of God with power by the resurrection from the dead.
F.E.R. Exactly. It was expedient for them that He went away, because He would send the Comforter to them; then in the coming of the Comforter you get the plain declaration that He is the sent One of the Father. Of course you can easily understand that only faith could know the Father as the only true God, because, without faith, you could know nothing about the Father. It is only faith in those who have got the Holy Spirit that enables them to know the Son as the sent One; otherwise you could not know that He is with the Father.
Ques. Why is it the only "true God"?
F.E.R. I suppose there are many pretensions to deity in the world; the great idea of "true" in John's writings is that whatever is spoken of as "true" is genuine. He is proved to be genuine in the fact that He is revealed.
Ques. It would be impossible to speak of knowing the Father apart from knowing the Son?
F.E.R. Quite so.
Ques. In connection with what you said just now as to relationships with the Persons, how do we stand in regard to Christ?
F.E.R. We stand in relationship to the Father in the place of sons; and in relationship to Christ as His companions, "As he is, so are we in this world" -- you stand in companionship to Christ; as He says here, "that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them". Then, too, He says, "I will come to you", and "The Father himself loveth you". I
{394}
think the Lord appears to take the utmost possible pains to let them understand that He identifies Himself with them, takes their side, in a sense.
Rem. "I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one".
F.E.R. Quite so.
Rem. There is a very interesting verse in the epistle giving the connection, "Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world" -- the two things come out here, the Spirit, and then the fact of the Father having sent the Son.
F.E.R. Yes. Other beings do assume authority over men, but the apostle says to them, "Little children, keep yourselves from idols". There are plenty of other things and other beings that claim the heart of man, that seek a place of authority in the heart of man.
Rem. You get it in the Thessalonians, "Ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God".
F.E.R. Yes, the true God is proved to be the true God when He reveals Himself.
Rem. It was not really the true God that the Pharisees worshipped, they knew nothing of grace or of mercy.
F.E.R. No; and people today who talk about the Almighty God do not know God, they do not know the Father. I think that, if you do not know the Father, you do not really know the only true God; you could not be said to know God at all really if you did not know the Father.
Rem. That is the way in which He is to be known today.
F.E.R. Quite so. I think that, at any particular moment, God must be known in the way in which He presents Himself, and if you do not know Him as He has been pleased to reveal Himself at that particular
{395}
moment, it is clear that you do not know God. I may believe that God is Almighty, and I may believe that He is a Judge, but I do not *know* Him in that way; it is impossible that God should be known to me as Lawgiver, or Judge, today, and yet both are true of Him, but no one could know Him as such.
Rem. And the particular testimony given to the saints forms and fashions them.
F.E.R. Yes; the only way in which you can know God today is as a Saviour God, and if you do not know Him as that, you do not know Him at all; if you know Him now, you must know Him as He presents Himself now, and anyone who knows Him as a Saviour God must have salvation.
Rem. "Saviour God" is characteristic of the present testimony.
F.E.R. Exactly. You know He is willing for "all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth". He would have all men to be saved, that is what is characteristic of Him.
Rem. It is a very great thing to have the present truth.
F.E.R. Yes; you see people have not got the idea of salvation in the present; it must hang on the knowledge of God in the way in which He presents Himself; if you know Him as a Saviour God, you must be saved, that is certain.
Ques. It is incontrovertible, but what about when He comes out as a Judge?
F.E.R. But the great point for me is the present testimony that God is a Saviour God. The fact is this, I have no need to be troubled about coming into judgment if I know God now as a Saviour; if you would know God you must know Him as He presents Himself at this moment, not as He will do in the future, nor has done in the past, but as He presents Himself *now*. Abraham's blessing all hangs on the revelation of God as Almighty; and Israel's on the
{396}
revelation of God as Jehovah, and ours depends upon the revelation of God as Saviour, and if you know Him as a Saviour you must be saved, and if you are not, you do not know Him at all. People who go through great exercises have not apprehended the light in which God presents Himself to men today; their exercises would all come to an end if they apprehended Him as a Saviour.
Ques. And you learn that He is a Justifier?
F.E.R. Yes; and justification is not an act of God; you learn than justification is His attitude towards men. He is "just, and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus" -- that is His attitude towards men; and if you apprehend Him in that attitude, you must be justified.
Rem. It shows us how it all depends upon the knowledge of God.
F.E.R. Yes, and in the character and attitude in which He is revealed at any given moment; it is not that God changes, God never changes, but He may change His attitude.
Rem. That necessarily must be so, because God could not have the same attitude towards a fallen being as towards an unfallen.
F.E.R. No. The fact is, God has come out in the Son, and He has come out as a Saviour God, and there is one Mediator, Christ Jesus. It is the same thing in principle as "The Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world". But now when it is a question of a soul coming back to God, returning to God, what he finds is that it is the Father who is presented to him as God, and the Son as the sent One of the Father; but that is not exactly the attitude in which God presents Himself to man; that is what you find out when you *have* returned. "Saviour" is God's attitude universally to man, but when the light has taken effect, and I have returned to God, I find that the Father is presented to me as God, and that Jesus Christ is His
{397}
sent One. I feel that passage in 1 Timothy is the finest gospel passage in Scripture. God's attitude towards man is that of Saviour God.
Ques. Why do you say justification is not an "act" of God?
F.E.R. The act of God was the resurrection of Christ, but then that act makes known His mind in regard of all men; you have to learn God's mind in the resurrection of Christ; @Romans 4: 24, 25.
Rem. It is not that when a person really believes then God does a certain act to justify that man -- if that were so, it would be no longer faith.
Ques. Would you read "justification" or "justifying" in that verse (@Romans 4: 24)?
F.E.R. Well, you could not exactly render it "justifying". The moment when a person believes is the moment that he is justified; you come then into the light of God; but God has not altered. It is the justification of him that believes in Jesus, only that, until that moment he had not come into it. It is, of course, individual as far as you are concerned, it is good for you; you are justified.
Rem. You come into the benefit of the act of God, but that took place more than eighteen hundred years ago.
F.E.R. Yes, but you come into it believing on Him that raised from the dead Jesus our Lord.
Ques. What is the work here, "the work which thou gavest me to do" (verse 4)?
F.E.R. Well, I think the work -- as far as I understand it -- was completely maintaining the glory of God where it had been called in question -- in the very place where God had been dishonoured, and where every attribute of God had been dragged in the dust.
Ques. Is it like @Psalm 40?
F.E.R. It is not exactly the work there, but the will, "Lo, I come to do thy will". What is more
{398}
analogous to that is that He takes away the whole system of sacrifices; but the "work" was the glorifying of God, of every attribute of God which had been dishonoured down here. What testimony was there down here to the righteousness of God, or to His holiness, or His grace, or even to His love? The effect of sin was to dishonour every attribute of God, in a certain sense. Look at the beginnings of things here -- God makes a man on the earth, and that man flies in the face of God; then God sets up a man to govern the world, and that man gets drunk -- and what was all that in the presence of the universe? Why, that every attribute of God was dishonoured. Man was no testimony to God's righteousness, or holiness, or to His skill, or anything else, but just the contrary. Well then, the Son comes and He glorifies God in regard of everything that had dishonoured Him. But if you take all the dispensations of man -- God makes an innocent man, and the man sins; He sets up a kingdom, and the king falls into sin; then He sets up a Gentile as head, and that man calls upon all men to fall down and worship an image that he himself had made -- and all that.
Rem. And all the more serious because man had been made in God's image.
F.E.R. Yes, much more serious.
Rem. I suppose that all the universe should have seen God's representative in man!
F.E.R. Yes; and the universe does see it in Christ; He first makes it evident that He is the righteous One -- that is made evident in the whole way and path of the Lord here on the earth -- it is evident that He is the righteous One; then He glorifies God in regard of every question that had been raised; every question is taken up in the cross.
Ques. Is it God that makes it evident?
F.E.R. No, I think it is made evident in the pathway
{399}
of the Lord here, and He could say, "Which of you convinceth me of sin?"
Ques. Giving God His due is righteousness?
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. Do both statements in verse 4 apply to the path and the cross?
F.E.R. "I have glorified thee on the earth" is one statement, and "finished the work" is another -- that is more the cross; because the cross was not exactly upon the earth, He was lifted up from the earth; I think at the cross the position of Christ -- it is most important to take it in -- the position of Christ on the cross was altogether peculiar, because it was *vicarious*. He occupied a position not His own, but the position of others. The position of Christ on the cross was not representative -- that is not the true idea -- He was there *vicariously*. He appears in the presence of God for us -- that is representatively, but He is not vicariously there.
Ques. How would you define "vicarious"?
F.E.R. "Vicarious" describes the position of One who occupies the place of another in contrast with what is representative.
Ques. Why do you quote "lifted up from the earth" in connection with "vicarious"?
F.E.R. Because He glorified God on the earth, and so it was not morally just that He should suffer upon the earth, and therefore it is that He is lifted up between heaven and earth, really to take the place of man.
Ques. And therefore, too, He draws our hearts away from the earth?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
Ques. Do you mean taking man's place as a curse?
F.E.R. Yes, man's place in the presence of God; and now Christ is representative for His *people*.
{400}
Ques. And He will bring them where He is?
F.E.R. Yes; but when He was on the cross He was not representative of His people but there vicariously for all men -- He gave Himself a ransom for all men.
Ques. And, lifted up from the earth, He became an object for faith?
F.E.R. Quite so.
Ques. Is it as the righteous One that He is there representatively in the presence of the Father?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. I think the Lord takes up verses 4 and 5 in connection with the thought in verse 3, "Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent".
He glorifies Him on the earth as the sent One; I think that flows out of verse 3.
Ques. Then verse 4 is that the sent One came that God might have full scope to effect His will?
F.E.R. Yes; He first speaks from the position of man down here, and then in verse 4 He speaks as a sent One who had glorified God on the earth. That is the difference between the two expressions. First, as to His actual position down here, He was a Man in humiliation, and so He could pray, "Glorify thy Son", but when He comes to verse 3 He is the sent One of the Father -- the two expressions are perfectly suitable. It is the sent One who is in that place, not at all the idea of the union of God and man, but the One who comes out from the Father that He might accomplish the will of the Father.
Rem. It is very wonderful how irresistibly we are drawn back to the One who was in the heart of the Father. Our only resource is in Him.
F.E.R. Yes. No human being can tell why it is so, but counsel belongs to the Father, as we have it. "All the Father's counsels claiming", etc. They are centred in the Son, but evidently counsels in Scripture are connected with the name of the Father, and if it were not for that the condition of the world would be
{401}
completely hopeless. Man has rejected every overture of God; no overture that God ever made but they rejected -- what then remains? Why, nothing whatever but the Father's counsels. And then in connection with that comes out the principle, which everyone must allow -- the principle of *sovereignty*.
CHAPTER 17: 6 TO END
F.E.R. From verse 6 and onwards for a few verses we get an account of the service which Christ had carried out with regard to the disciples, it is all in relation to the Father, "I have manifested *thy* name", and "they have kept *thy* word". It is a kind of commendation, in that way, of the disciples -- "I am glorified in them".
Ques. You do not think this part of it, "I have manifested thy name", is anticipative, do you?
F.E.R. Oh, no, I think He had manifested the Father's name, "I have declared unto them thy name".
Rem. You would say that that was the object for which they were given to Him of the Father?
F.E.R. I think so, "They were thine, and thou gavest them me". Then the Lord, in a certain sense, commends them (though I do not quite like that expression); He says, "They have kept thy word", etc.
Rem. He gives them credit for a great deal more than they apparently apprehended.
F.E.R. Yes, I think He credits them apart from their apprehension.
Rem. The foundation was laid in them, and then the Spirit came and built upon that which was there.
F.E.R. Yes; if they did not reject His word, then they accepted it; there is no intermediate course, they either kept His word or rejected it.
Rem. They had stood the great test, which was the acceptance of Himself.
{402}
F.E.R. Yes, and that gives them full credit before the Father. It is very remarkable how the Lord speaks of everything as from the Father; He does not speak of anything as having its source in Himself; it is the Father's name, and the Father's word, and "all things whatsoever thou hast given me", and then even of Himself He says, "they ... have known surely that I came out from thee". The Father is regarded as being the source of everything.
Rem. "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father".
F.E.R. Yes; but you get the statement in the epistle of John, "The Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world". I think that, in the highest sense of it, Scripture itself is the word of the Father -- all that we get in Scripture is the Father's word. Of course it is the word of God, but, looked at in the highest sense of it, it is the word of the Father.
Rem. It is spoken of, is it not, as the holy writing?
F.E.R. Yes, both as "holy writings" and "sacred letters". You see, the world, as such, has failed -- man has failed, but then comes to light another thing, and that is the Father's counsel. The world has failed under every possible kind of test, it has become manifest beyond all question that man has failed; and man will not have the grace of God. One thing is certain, that grace is more unpalatable to man than law. You see that in the present day in the mass of people, the natural man would sooner have law than grace. You go and talk to a man of the world about the forgiveness of sins, he would much rather you should talk to him about law, that he should love God with all his heart, and his neighbour as himself. He would rather that you should tell him that than about the forgiveness of sins.
Rem. On the same principle as with the children of Israel when they said, "All that the Lord hath said will we do"?
{403}
F.E.R. Yes; if you present to man anything that recognises competency in man he will accept it, but when you come to him with the wisdom of God, it is to the Jew a stumbling-block and to the Greeks foolishness.
Rem. And yet there is no other ground for me at all than grace.
F.E.R. No; you see, the grace of God could not come in until there had been the perfect demonstration before God of man's true position in regard to God, and it is in that way that the cross comes in; the cross was the demonstration of man's true position with regard to God. In relation to God, man was under the curse of a broken law, and God brought about in the cross the perfect demonstration of man's position, so that by that way the grace of God might come in. Judgment came in because Christ took that place vicariously, and He was dealt with according to the place which He had taken; but at the same time, there was the triumph of grace over judgment, the full measure of judgment was there, but grace comes in by it. But we were only speaking of that in connection with the thought that grace was unpalatable to the natural man. In spite of all that, God continues to present His grace to man although it is true, I am sure, that the natural man rejects it. It came out in the presence of Christ here, He came to man "full of grace and truth", and they rejected grace -- they rejected Christ.
Ques. They murmured at Him?
F.E.R. Yes, and they did their very best to discredit His miracles -- just like the rationalists today, they try to account for the miracles in some natural way. But do away with the miracles, and you have done away with Christ.
Ques. There are a great many Sadducees today.
F.E.R. Yes, and a great many Pharisees too. He came here with the power to relieve man of every
{404}
disability under which he was, and if it were not so, then I say He was not an expression of the grace of God -- I think that is just.
Rem. It would have been ineffectual to man.
F.E.R. Yes, the grace of God, allied with power, must relieve man of every disability which was on man by reason of sin. And therefore if Christ did not work miracles, He was not an expression of the grace of God. When I speak of miracles, I see them as the expression of the power that could relieve man of every pressure that sin had brought upon him. He could heal the leper.
Ques. All the sign-miracles were of that character?
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. Virtue went out of Him?
F.E.R. Yes, that was the principle of it, and it healed them all.
Rem. It is very instructive to see the way the Lord touches people, and they Him.
F.E.R. Yes; no two miracles are exactly the same, there is a peculiarity about each one. The point to me is that God still presents grace to man. The gospel is just a continuation of the ministry of Christ. God will continue on that line, and yet with the perfect knowledge that the heart of man will not have grace. But then another thing comes in in connection with Christ, and that is the revelation of the Father's counsels. The great public testimony to the world is grace, and yet God knows perfectly well that the heart of man refuses it, but underneath there is another line of truth, and that is the Father's counsels.
Rem. There is no excuse for man, so that God can righteously judge the world, though He still presents grace to man; it delivers the man that receives it, but those who reject it are left without excuse.
F.E.R. Yes; the hindrance is on man's side to receiving the grace of God, for God "will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of
{405}
the truth", and "The grace of God that carries with it salvation for all men has appeared". It is most important to apprehend that.
Ques. Is it not pride that hinders man?
F.E.R. I think so. And I think that, except where God is working, you really stumble people greatly by talking to them about the forgiveness of sins.
Rem. They do not need it -- or rather they have no sense of their need of it.
F.E.R. No sense of it, they do not see that sin has disqualified them for God -- they are lepers without knowing it, and paralytics, too.
Rem. And they are not aware of their need because they are under the power of Satan.
F.E.R. Well, I think the world has a good bit to do with it; the world, and sin, and Satan.
Ques. The world has more reference, has it not, to the system of things set up on the earth?
F.E.R. Quite so, but the world is the great system that Satan uses to blind people -- he is the god of this world, and he uses this world to blind people. I think I can remember it of myself, that I had a sense that, if I accepted the grace of God, God would have a certain claim over me; and I do not think that people want to recognise that claim, they do not want to answer to that claim. You see, if you receive forgiveness of sins by the grace of God, God must have a certain claim upon you; anyone who does receive the grace of God recognises the claim of Christ upon him. Then, too, you get grace's teaching, "Teaching us that, denying ungodliness, and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world". You have to change your ways if you come under the sway of grace, and the mass of people are not anxious to change their ways, the world has a great attraction for them. But the world, as it is, is not agreeable to God; "All that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride
{406}
of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world". It is not agreeable to God, but, on the contrary, it is hateful to Him. There is a willingness to be carried on in the course of this world -- the mass of people like the gratification of the eye; either the man of taste or the gross man likes the gratification of the flesh, and the man of mind likes the pride of life, he wants to go on in that direction, anyway.
Rem. But the love of the Father is not in such?
F.E.R. No, because he loves the very things that are abominable to the Father.
Ques. In reference to what you said as to the law, it really did not make such a demand upon men as grace did, that is, in their own estimation?
F.E.R. No, because it recognised competency in man. You see, in churches they repeat the ten commandments, and in connection with each commandment there is a prayer, "Lord, incline our hearts to keep this law". Well, if the Lord inclines your heart, you can keep that law; but then, if your heart is inclined to keep God's law, that is not grace, but law. Grace comes in on the ground that you have no claim whatever upon God, and that if you go on as you are you will come under judgment; but then you find that God does not condemn but He forgives, there is full remission; that is how grace comes in. Law is the recognition of man.
But I was only speaking of that in connection with the line that comes out previously in John; then here you get the Father's counsel, the Father's word and counsel, and in connection with that you get the Son. The Son is the Centre and Object of all the counsels of the Father, and the Father draws to the Son. And so here, in speaking of the disciples, He says, "They were thine, and thou gavest them me" -- they were drawn to the Son. The moment the Son came here, He came as the End and Object of the Father's counsels,
{407}
and the activity of the Father came in to lead to the Son, He draws to the Son.
Ques. And He brings them to the Father?
F.E.R. Quite so. I think you get the full force of it in the verse we often sing
<blockquote>"Thou gav'st us, in eternal love, <br>To Him to bring us home, to Thee, <br>Suited to Thine own thoughts above, <br>As sons like Him, with Him to be". (`88:1) </blockquote>
I think that is a most beautiful expression of it.
Ques. And I suppose that, in this chapter, it is that company that He is occupied with?
F.E.R. Yes, exactly. The Lord here takes up the disciples, if one might use such an expression, in order to commend them to the Father; He commends not Himself; but them to the Father.
Rem. How the glory of the Person comes out here, in the way He can demand for them of the Father.
F.E.R. Yes, He takes up the place of Object and Centre of the Father's counsels; the new system of things originated entirely in the Father.
Rem. And He was one in life and relationship with the Father.
F.E.R. Yes; and in the previous chapter He has shown them that they are loved of the Father.
Ques. And that comes in entirely outside the question of responsibility, and so on?
F.E.R. Yes; these are all entirely subordinate questions; even the presentation of the gospel to man is subordinate to the great question of the Father's counsels. That is my impression.
Rem. God would not keep on with man as He does unless He had some end in view.
F.E.R. No, it is out of the question. God just goes on in that way until He brings things to a close.
Ques. In looking at those whom the Father had drawn to Him, would you bring in the question of their previous history at all?
{408}
F.E.R. Oh, no; it is a question of the sovereignty of divine counsels that gave them to the Son. It is rather the thought of being "chosen in him before the foundation of the world" that comes in there. He says of them, "They were thine, and thou gavest them me". They were the Father's in eternal counsel, and they were given to the Son in time; when the Son became man, they were given to Him.
Ques. Would what is here stated be applicable to others than apostles?
F.E.R. "They have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee", and "They have believed that thou didst send me". There is nothing in the passage that I see, that might not be applicable to others.
Rem. And it is essential that we should believe what they believed.
F.E.R. Yes. The apostle, in his first epistle, speaks of writing "that ye also may have fellowship with us". He fully recognises the place of the apostles, but he desires that the saints should have fellowship with them. He quite takes that place, "Truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ".
Ques. Is the "kept thy word" here the same as in the address to the church of Philadelphia, "For thou hast ... kept my word, and hast not denied my name"?
F.E.R. Well, here it is the Father's word, it is looked at in that light; whereas in Philadelphia it is more the word of Christ, and from where He now is; it is the expression of Himself where He now is. Both the "word" and the "name" there represent Christ, not as upon earth, but as in heaven. When here upon earth He was making known the Father's name. His name in @Revelation 3 includes all that is set forth in Him.
Ques. What is the difference between keeping the
{409}
Father's word and receiving the Father's words (verses 6 and 8)?
F.E.R. Well, the Father's word is John's idea of the Father's testimony, which the Son brought here, that is the general idea of it; but "words" give me more the idea of communications in detail. For example, the ten commandments were called the ten words.
Rem. So, in verse 14, it brought down the hatred of the world.
F.E.R. Yes; but that is in connection with the kingdom; He gave the word there to the disciples for testimony, and it was that that brought them into collision with the world. Here the Lord first commends them, and then He prays for them, but He sets to work to commend them to the Father first, and the commendation really amounts to this, that, whatever amount of intelligence they might have, at all events they had recognised in principle the Father as being the source of all that came out by the Son -- that is the Lord's commendation of them. I do not believe that any of us will be really established if we do not first see that the great principle of Scripture is the Father's word. The indefinite idea that Scripture is the word of God is not, to my mind, really strong enough -- you want to make it stronger and more definite. The great first principle and predominating idea of Scripture is that it is the Father's word.
Ques. You are speaking now of the whole of Scripture?
F.E.R. Yes; and when Christ came, what He brought out accomplished everything. For instance, take @Genesis 1, it opens with "In the beginning God", but in @John 1 you get, "In the beginning was the Word". All that the unbeliever allows is a creation of certain laws; he says that everything in nature is the product of certain laws. The great crucial question of the day is, have we a revelation from God? Now if I
{410}
were asked on what I pin my faith I would say, On two things, one is the Lordship of Christ, and the other is the presence of the Holy Spirit; and for this reason, that if you do allow those two things, everything in Scripture will stand; but on the contrary, if you let them go, everything is gone.
Rem. That brings in resurrection, because He could only be Lord in resurrection.
F.E.R. Yes. He could only be Lord in manhood and resurrection. If the Son had remained a divine Person simply -- as a divine Person He could not have been Lord, it would have had no application to Him; but as becoming Lord it involves His manhood and resurrection. His becoming Man simply was not *large* enough, because it put Him in touch with only a limited class of people, but resurrection gave Him a ground in regard of all -- He "rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living". It gives Him a kind of universal place. If you allow the Lordship of Christ and the presence of the Holy Spirit, every bit of Scripture will stand, because the One who is Lord has put His sanction on the whole of Scripture; and if you do not allow that, then I have nothing more to say to you, but I am prepared for death if it became a question of life and death; I think it is a great thing to apprehend the crucial point where you take your place, and are prepared to suffer for it. Of course, Scripture contains a solution of every difficulty, although I am not speaking of that, but it is a very great point to find a ground on which you can take your stand, whatever the consequences may be. You may lose the world, or your friends, or relatives, or anything else, but I take my stand there, that Christ is Lord, and that the Holy Spirit is here. Revelation is founded on that. The secret of all infidelity is that people have not got the Lord. If they had the real foundation of Christ as Lord they would not be shaken at all; and people ought not
{411}
to be shaken, they ought to have the assurance of everything in themselves. The defect in people is that they have not this assurance -- they are not rooted and grounded in these blessed facts and realities.
Rem. If the scripture stands, people are responsible.
F.E.R. Yes.
Rem. The fact of the revelation of God leaves man without excuse.
F.E.R. Quite so; because God has given man the opportunity of walking in the light, and man will most surely be judged by the light. If God has given light to man, man must be judged by that light; he is not left without responsibility, that is an absurd thought. The Lord says, "The word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day". And then again it is, "For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak", chapter 12: 48, 49.
Now you see the Lord prays for them. He says, "I pray for them: I pray not for the world" -- He is not glorified in the world, but in them.
Rem. Is it that He was to be seen in them?
F.E.R. Yes; the place to which He was entitled was that He should have been seen and glorified in the world, but that has not yet come about. The world has failed, but He is glorified in those who were given to Him out of the world.
Ques. Does it at all refer to the psalm, "I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance"?
F.E.R. No, I do not think that is the idea at all.
Ques. It is limited to His own here?
F.E.R. Quite so. The grace of God comes out to the world, but, at the same time, I do not think that Christ occupies Himself with the world -- He is occupied with His own. You do get the idea of the love of God being towards the world, but not that of the love of Christ for the world. I think that the love of Christ,
{412}
the mind of Christ, is towards His own, to those whom the Father has given Him out of the world. There was no hope for the world when Christ died, so the gospel comes into the world to save men out of it; the object of the gospel is not to recognise the world as it is, but to draw men out of it. You find the question has been raised as to whether the gospel has benefited the world or not; well, I would not pursue that question. It never was intended to act in that way; it was intended as a light to lead men out of the world. The parable of the woman with the candle, sweeping the house, shows us that clearly enough.
Rem. So that the gospel has not failed of its intent?
F.E.R. Not at all. At the same time, it is certain that whatever there is of mercy and philanthropy in the world is owing to Christianity, it is a matter that is undeniable.
Rem. In @Romans 11 it speaks of the stumbling of the Jews being for the riches of the world, and their diminishing being for the riches of the Gentiles.
F.E.R. Yes, it was the riches of the Gentiles and of the world, because it brought them within the reach of God's testimony.
Ques. So the world has in that way profited by it?
F.E.R. Yes; take for example hospitals. They are all the result of Christianity. Where would you have found one among the Romans or the Greeks? Neither one nor the other was a merciful people at all. The exposure of children was a common thing among the Romans, you certainly would not have found hospitals among them; it was hard times for the weaklings, anyway.
Rem. But now the world wants to cast off that which proved for their benefit.
F.E.R. Yes, retaining all the benefits. The principle of the whole thing in men's minds is that everything which has come in is merely a step in the education of the world, and when that process is completed
{413}
they will break away from their leading-strings; they only wait until man has arrived at full age, and then he will arrange for himself -- that is the kind of thought that is abroad today.
Ques. And therefore the only thing for us is the Father's counsels?
F.E.R. I think so; and I would repeat what I said just now, that you have got to take your stand, and you are to be "strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might". The armour of God is everything of Christ, put on as a panoply -- a covering of truth, and righteousness, and faith.
Everything that Christ has brought in is to be put on as a covering; not just believed, but you are to be clothed in it, and then you are able to meet the devil. Everything that Christ brought in is to characterise you. What would the devil present in contrast to truth and righteousness and faith? But these are what Christ has brought, and if I have put them on I have got the whole panoply of God. And truly salvation is better than infidelity. I think that when you are "strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might", that is final; it is a point at which you arrive, you have put on the whole armour of God.
Now the Lord's prayer for the apostles is contained in one single petition: "that they may be one, as we are one", that is the object of the petition. "Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are. While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name".
Ques. They were to be one in the same bond as between the Father and the Son?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. And the object -- the effect of it -- was to bring them into direct connection with the Father's name; they were already in a kind of indirect connection with the Father's name through Him, but the object of the prayer is to bring them
{414}
into direct touch with, and contact with, the Father's name, that is, in relationship with the Father; and the result of it would be that, if they were kept in that way, there would be unity, "that they may be one, as we are". The testimony was unity, the having one common interest, just as the Father and the Son are one in counsel and purpose and working; so everything is to be of the same character of unity as between the Father and the Son, as it says, "The Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth", and these things "doeth the Son likewise", chapter 5: 19, 20. This, too, was to be effected as between the apostles, and it was effected. For even when Paul comes in, and he presents a difficulty, in a way, as being outside the twelve, yet, even then, the unity was maintained. He had a distinctive presentation of the gospel, and preached it, and worked among the Gentiles, but you find that whenever any great question arose, he comes up to Jerusalem that the question might be settled at Jerusalem.
"While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name" -- think of the tender care of the Lord for the apostles -- "and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition", and he perished because of apostasy.
Ques. Is it the same word there as in chapter 10, "shall never perish"?
F.E.R. Yes; the connection of the words here is between perish and perdition. Only two men are called "the son of perdition", Judas and Antichrist. You get the "Sons of Belial" in the Old Testament, but in the whole of Scripture you only get these two individual men marked out as sons of perdition. Judas perished by apostasy. I should suppose he had been attracted to Christ in the first instance, but he became apostate from Christ and betrayed Him.
Ques. And there is no recovery for apostasy?
F.E.R. Well, what could there be? If a man
{415}
turns away from God, and what God gives him, if he refuses Christ, and the full light of God, there is nothing more for him, it is impossible to form a link between that man and Christ.
Judas must have seen everything that the Lord did; he had been in the company of the Lord for three and a half years, heard His words, and seen His works, and I have no doubt had even performed miracles himself, and yet, in spite of all that, you get the man ruled by covetousness. It only shows what the heart of man is. You have to be exceedingly careful of the principles that dominate in the heart; even the Christian has to watch what his heart is covering up, evil motives are very insidious, and they may work in a very subtle sort of way. With Judas it was no sudden thing, he began with covetousness, then Satan tempts him, and then Satan enters into him, but it was all step by step. No one knows how very strong in the heart of man is the love of possession, it is a principle of immense power. When the devil came to the Lord he said, "Command that these stones be made bread". Well, the Lord could have turned those stones into bread, or into gold, if He had liked, but His answer is, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God". You might get plenty of bread to eat, and no life at all morally, but it is by "every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God" that we are to live.
CHAPTER 17: 14 TO END
F.E.R. It is very remarkable how completely the Lord puts the disciples into His own position here, I mean that He puts them in the place which He had occupied, "I have given them thy word"; and then, "They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world"; and then, too, "As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the
{416}
world". They had the Father's word -- that is, He puts the testimony, as it were, into their hands; they were not of the world, and they were sent of Him, even as He had been sent by the Father. It is a very remarkable placing of them in His own position, the position which He had occupied. Then the prayer is that they might be maintained in it, consciously maintained in it.
Rem. In the testimony of the Father.
F.E.R. I mean in what was suited to that testimony. Anyone who was of the world could not bear testimony to the Father; "All that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world". If a man is of the world, he speaks of the world, he could not bear testimony to the Father, and therefore it is He says, "They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world".
Ques. What is the difference between the "words" which He had given them and verse 14, "I have given them thy word"?
F.E.R. I think the "words" are more the details. Whatever "words" the Father had made known to Him, He had given them, He kept nothing back from them in that way; and what He got from the Father was given to Him for communication. Whatever Christ received of the Father was for that end.
Rem. He had given to them the Father's word, and the world had hated them.
F.E.R. Yes, because "they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world"; the world loves what is of itself and it cannot, and does not, love what is not of itself. If we begin to learn of Christ, you come to Him and learn of Him. In that way you become like Him, and you will very soon become conscious that the world is in antagonism to you. What is of the Father is not likely to find favour in the world, just because it is not of the world-system. I think the
{417}
world naturally likes what is of itself -- what is akin to it, and what answers to it -- but it is scarcely conceivable that the world would like what is opposed to it.
Ques. How does that fit in with the verse in Galatians which says, "Against such there is no law"?
F.E.R. Well, I think you can understand that if a man is bringing forth the fruits of the Spirit, he is entirely outside the application of law. If he is bringing forth the fruits of the Spirit, such as "love, joy, peace", well, the law has no application there. The law could not apply in such a case, you could not have a law against what is of God.
Ques. You take it to be the law of God, not man's law?
F.E.R. It is the divine law, and you could not have that against what is of God; it is impossible, in the very nature of it, that any commandments of God should be against what is of God. You see how the working of things would be if you got the love of Christ in a person, the desire of that person would be to bring the testimony of Christ into this world; well, if you unfold that you will very soon bring yourself into antagonism with the world. The Lord Himself was sent in divine love by the Father, but then He could not acquiesce in the state of things here, and love was therefore brought into antagonism with men. It is impossible that divine love should acquiesce in what was here, and that makes good what the Lord says, "They have both seen and hated both me and my Father". A great many people fancy that love would lead a man to acquiesce in what he finds here, to accept what is here, but divine love could not accept it. The Lord would perform an act of mercy on the Sabbath day, for instance, for mercy could not be bound by the Sabbath day, but then that brings Him into collision with the Jews. The secret comes out in His answer, "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work".
{418}
Rem. And now the cross has come in and separated us from the world, and put everything, too, into its place.
F.E.R. Yes. You see, a Christian might be amiable, and, as far as he could, anxious to go on in peace, and desirous not to offend, but that is not love. There might be every possible desire to go on with men, and not offend, he might do all that, and people would admire one's amiability and all that, but what I think is, love would carry you further than that, it would prevent your acquiescence in things here. People like Christians well enough as long as they do not interfere, or come forward in testimony; it is the testimony that stirs up the opposition and enmity. What the world says very generally is, "Let every man alone, let a man act according to his conscientious convictions -- let a Jew be a Jew, and let a Christian be a Christian, let every man act according to his conscience" and so on; but there is no divine love in that, and, too, it involves the giving up the idea that there is such a thing here as divine truth. Love *must* be faithful, and if the testimony comes in -- "Thy word" -- I am very well convinced it will very soon bring a person into collision with the world. The apostles were bound to recognise this, on the word of the Lord, that they were not of the world, even as He was not of the world. They had another origin altogether, and the world hated them because they were not of the world. The word was given them for testimony, as I understand it, not simply for their own intelligence and comfort; and then really, to be effective in testimony, at all events in the word of the Father, they had to know that they were not of the world, even as He was not of the world.
Ques. Was it in view of testimony that He said, "In the world ye shall have tribulation"?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so; there is a great world-system here upon earth, and I think that great system
{419}
will only hear what is of itself -- it will only tolerate what is of itself. Many people have a difficulty in taking in the idea of a great world-system, but Scripture contemplates it, and speaks of it continually, and I think, too, we become conscious that there is this great world-system, and the principle that lies at the root of it is that of opposing anything that is not of itself. If you can contribute to it it will tolerate you, but not otherwise. You could not come into contact with the world and not find that out; "the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father but is of the world" -- the source of them is the world; and if you come to tell people that everything that supports the world-system, and characterises it, is about to pass away, but that the word of God abides for ever -- well, I do not think the world would care much about that testimony.
Ques. And that is to be a living testimony?
F.E.R. Yes; people think you very peculiar if you do not answer to the lust of the flesh, and of the eye, and to the pride of life, but your answer is they are all to pass away, God does not intend to improve the world. He waters the word of truth in secret, but the divine idea is to set the world aside altogether.
Rem. That is what marked the Lord's pathway all along, He was *not* trying to improve the world or anything of that sort.
F.E.R. No. Here He says, "I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world". They were sent into the world even as He was sent into it; no one in the present day could say he was sent into the world as Christ was, at least not in the sense that is brought out here.
Ques. It is restricted to the apostles?
F.E.R. I think so. They were sent into the world for the introduction of the testimony; it began in the Lord, but it had to be maintained in that way in the
{420}
power of the Holy Spirit, and therefore the Holy Spirit was sent in His name to bear witness to Him.
Ques. The testimony is still here?
F.E.R. Yes; the testimony is here, but it has really come to us by the apostles -- we have not got it through Christ, but it has reached us through the apostles. All that we know about Christ has been communicated to us by the apostles, and whatever we know of the ministry of the Lord we learn through them.
Rem. You get that in @Hebrews 2, "which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him".
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. What do you understand by "Sanctify them by the truth: thy word is truth"?
F.E.R. I think He makes ample provision for their sanctification, complete provision for it. The idea of the word 'sanctify' does not carry the thought generally connected with it; it is not a progressive thing at all, but they were set apart by the truth; the truth set them apart once for all, "Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth".
Ques. And it was the truth that was opposed to the world, and therefore it, of itself set them apart?
F.E.R. Yes; I think that, by the very truth, they were of another colour.
Ques. They were of a new order?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. You have to see that the primary application of it is to the apostles. The early part of the chapter is all connected with their place in testimony up to verse 19; then you get the prayer of the Lord widening out to all those who should believe on Him through their word, for we are all the fruit of the apostle's testimony, in one sense. "Sanctify them through thy truth" -- He does not say "through thy word".
Ques. What is "thy word" there, is it the Father's counsels?
{421}
F.E.R. I think it is the testimony, their testimony characterised them.
Rem. It is not the word, but the truth that sanctified them.
F.E.R. Yes; that is its character. The truth is that by which you can test everything; it is a standard, you have got a touchstone by which you can test everything, and what does not answer to that test you reject. If you know what is characteristic of the Father, it is a touchstone, it is truth, and therefore you reject what is not in accord with the Father; all that is in the world you reject, the lust of the flesh, and of the eye, and the pride of life, because it is not in accord with the Father. The word of the Father becomes, in that way, a touchstone, and you test all by it, and what does not answer to the test you reject. I fancy that is the force of it. It is "thy word" in that character as *truth*. I have no doubt the apostles applied the test, and a great many things were presented to them in their day, in the world, and the point with them was as to whether it was in accordance with what they had.
Rem. John brings that out very strongly in his second epistle.
F.E.R. I think so, exactly. The great truths were of the Father, and of the Son; they had those two great truths, and they tested all by them. That Jesus was "Christ come in flesh" was the great touchstone then.
Ques. Is not the true meaning of "sanctified" "made holy"?
F.E.R. I do not think so. The literal meaning of the word is "to set apart", or, at all events, it is a meaning of the word, a form in which the word is used. You get the idea in 2 Timothy in connection with the vessels. The vessels are not made holy, but set apart, "He shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified and meet for the master's use".
Ques. And I suppose, too, that the idea of the
{422}
passage you quote was taken from the vessels in the temple, which were actually set apart for the Lord's use?
F.E.R. Yes. Then there is another scripture that gives you the idea where it speaks of an "unbelieving wife" being "sanctified" by a believing husband.
Rem. And yet the thought of "made holy" is frequently considered the true meaning of the word?
F.E.R. Yes; but you could not render the word "holy" in the case quoted of the wife.
Rem. In verse 19 the Lord Himself is set apart.
F.E.R. Yes; He sets Himself apart to give opportunity in them for the truth to have effect. "For their sakes I sanctify myself" -- He sets Himself apart for their sakes in order that the truth might have its full effect in them. If there had not been this interval, there would not have been the opportunity for the truth to have its effect with them. It gives opportunity for us to be "sanctified ones" by the truth; it is not quite "sanctified by the truth", but the real idea is that they might be characteristically those, sanctified ones in the power of the truth. There is one expression that makes it clear with regard to the Lord, "Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world". He was set apart for that; and so here, too, He sets Himself apart for them. It is "set apart" for some particular office or function; Christ is set apart now as Priest; He has not yet come into His rights, and what belongs to Him, but He is set apart for the priestly office.
What is looked for in the verse is the power of sanctification in the truth, "that they also might be sanctified [ones] through the truth", and the Lord gives additional force to the thing by sanctifying Himself.
Ques. Does it imply that they might be maintained in the truth?
F.E.R. Well, I think it is more that they might be
{423}
characterised by it; it is very practical in that way, not simply that you are separate, but that you are of another colour. It was a very favourite illustration of Mr. Stoney's, that you are a white crow among black ones.
Rem. And that would give the idea that you are of another order.
F.E.R. Yes; the fact is, you cannot have the sanctification otherwise, or else you would have it in the flesh.
Ques. And does it not involve His death, too, "For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth"?
F.E.R. Yes, it does, as you get it in Hebrews, "By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all" -- that must be the means of it. You see, it is impossible for the new order to be brought in if the old order had not been closed up to the glory of God.
Ques. And was not that, in a way, the making good of the Father's counsels?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. He had come to do the Father's will, and that part of it was done. It is not now the offering part, though He is still active, it is the sanctifying part that goes on now.
Ques. Do you get that in the second sanctification (verse 19)?
F.E.R. I think so. He sanctifies Himself that the truth might do its full work in the saints.
Rem. Mr. Stoney used to speak of the first as "constitutional sanctification" and the next as "circumstantial sanctification".
F.E.R. It is the same thought continued, in a way. I think it is a very important thing that the word of the Father should be in us, and be the *truth*; you not only want the testimony of the word, but you want it *in* you; it is the first element of the armour, "having your loins girt about with *truth*". Many have the
{424}
word, in a way, in whom it is not in the form of *truth*; if it has that place in you as *truth*, you then have a standard by which you judge everything. The effect would be to make you very sensitive about things; you would stand apart from things from which, otherwise, you would not have stood apart, because they do not suit the truth.
Rem. People often demand a passage of scripture for everything, it is not quite like that.
F.E.R. No, not quite. There may be many things that I feel are not in accordance with the truth, and in having the truth, I have got a touchstone by which I can judge them. There are a great many things -- associations and so on -- in the world for which I have not a "word" exactly, but I do not think you can always expect a person to give an exact reason for his refusal of certain things.
Rem. You get a sense of what would suit the Father.
F.E.R. Yes, the testimony becomes truth in us, it identifies itself with us. You begin by accepting it, you believe it, and then you are characterised by it, so that you have got "truth in the inward parts", "your loins girt about with truth". I think, you know, that Christianity is not much understood -- the Christianity of Scripture -- it is very poorly understood. I think very few people understand the true character of what the Lord put the disciples into here. Except in connection with divine power, they could not have carried it out for even a single instant.
Ques. What do "They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world", and I have "sent them into the world", mean?
F.E.R. That is the sort of ordination you want; human ordination is a very poor sort of thing after all. If any bishop were to offer to ordain me, I should say, "Your ordination is not good enough". I want a better ordination than that; the only ordination that
{425}
I know of is, "As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them". It is sad to see men struggling about such things as poor empty Anglican orders, and all that sort of thing; I can hardly understand men, even of common sense, struggling about such things. It only proves what I said a few minutes ago, how very little Christianity is known in the full power of it. There is one thing we may allow, that if the Lord is going to employ a man in His service, that man will have to go to college, that is certain; but it is not *man's* college. Paul went to it for fourteen years. That man must get a training, and a pretty long one, too. I will undertake to say this much, if you have got any man qualified to be a servant of the Lord you will find that he has gone through a very long training, no mere matter of two or three years, but of twenty, thirty, or even forty years. There is a training, but the only One who can teach is the Lord Himself. You need divine teaching to fit you for the Lord's service, but that is what man does not understand. You get here the consciousness that you are sanctified, you are set apart from the course of things down here; you do not expect countenance from the world. The apostles did not look for the world to accept them, so it was no good adopting worldly methods in their service, because they were not of the world.
Ques. Does not what you say come out in @Mark 3 when He chose twelve disciples, and it says, "and they went into an house", but you do not get them sent out until chapter 6 -- the training was with Himself in the house?
F.E.R. Yes, with Himself in the house. You see, the important point is this, a man is only effective in that of which he has the assurance; and man can only be effective in what he is conscious of, and not simply in what he believes. Now suppose, for example, I have never been in Paris, yet, for all that, I have not the faintest doubt of the existence of Paris, for I have
{426}
often heard of it; but I cannot talk freely about it, for I have never been there. But supposing I went to Paris for a month, I should be able to talk freely enough about the place, for then I should have an idea of the ordering of it, and of the position of the streets, and so on. You could not talk freely about a thing until you have been in it. I think the point that came up recently was very helpful as to @2 Corinthians 3: 8. In that scripture it is not righteousness that comes first, but the *Spirit*, and it is the Spirit, I have no doubt whatever, shedding abroad in our hearts the love of God. But it is then that you get the consciousness that you are outside all imputation; you have got consciousness then, and when you come into life, it is the "justification of life", and when you touch *that*, it is that you are conscious of being outside absolutely and entirely of all imputation. You really begin to enter into what is for God, and then it is that you get the consciousness of what is for man.
Rem. I feel how important this is at the present moment, because we have so confused the two things.
F.E.R. Yes. If a man is to be effective, he must be conscious of what he talks about.
Ques. And unless he is, it is impossible for him to be really set apart or "sanctified"?
F.E.R. Well, I think so. If, for instance, a man is conscious of having reached eternal life, that man will be able to give you an account of eternal life, as in the illustration just used of a man having been to Paris, and being thus qualified to speak of it.
Ques. In what way do you mean a servant would be effective?
F.E.R. Well, he could not be resisted or contradicted, except by positive opposition. I think you see it in the early days: everything was so real to the apostles, and they maintained the testimony in such power, that nobody could gainsay it.
{427}
Ques. What would you say is the secret of progress in divine things?
F.E.R. I think it is getting to the Lord, that is the beginning of the way. I think the great defect with all of us is, the Lord has not place enough with us.
Ques. Would you say Stephen was effective?
F.E.R. I think so; they could not gainsay him or resist him.
Ques. But there was no apparent result in the hearers?
F.E.R. Ah, but there was a mighty result in Christianity.
Rem. It does not necessarily follow that all who hear are saved.
F.E.R. No; the great thing is that you make a mark; that is what I understand by the Lord stooping down and writing on the ground in chapter 8. You make a mark.
Rem. Paul is sometimes spoken of as one of Stephen's converts.
F.E.R. I would not quite say that; the testimony by Stephen was, to all appearance, blotted out, but what it really meant was the setting aside of Judaism to bring in Christianity, it was in order really to make full room for the church. I think it is a very feeble thing to judge by the mere outward presentation of testimony, because you cannot tell at all how Christ is going to use it. You might get five thousand converted, or what not, but God may have other things to effect by the testimony.
In verse 20 you get the prayer opening out, "Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; that they all may be one", etc. I think there are two things which come out in this: one is unity, but the unity is to be manifested in complete separation from, and in complete independence of, the world. The moment they
{428}
began to mingle with the world they lost their power in the testimony. It was unity in complete separation from the world.
Ques. Was that prayer answered, would you say?
F.E.R. I think so; look at the early days of the church, and even in the bringing in of the Gentiles. The testimony was maintained in their complete separation from the world. The passage, to my mind, contemplates two spheres -- the Father and the Son, and "one in us" -- that is unity in life, the unity of the Father and the Son, "as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us". Then the other sphere is the world, and if you are in the one -- the divine sphere, the Father and the Son -- you are in entire separation from the other, from the world -- it is unity of life in that way.
Rem. This last clause of the verse, "that the world may believe", does not necessarily come to pass?
F.E.R. No, quite so.
Ques. Would the New Jerusalem be the fulfilment of it?
F.E.R. Well, I think the New Jerusalem is an answer to the further prayer, it has the glory of God, and so on; but I do not think it is exactly an answer to this prayer.
Rem. I suppose that, strictly speaking, the prayer had its application to those converted through the word of the apostles, and having had its fulfilment, it left the world that then was, the Jewish world, without excuse?
F.E.R. Yes; the world trembled, but the direct result was that they refused the testimony. I think it is a wonderful thing that we can leave this side, that is, the present order of things, to get to that side, that is, the side of *hope*, "to lay hold of the hope set before us". Every desire, every hope of the Christian is bound up with Christ, and you really want to get to
{429}
that side, where your hope is, where Christ is. You are going on to the hope, we all are going on to it, because none of us have reached Christ yet, but we have reached Him *in mind*; and I think it is in that way that the Lord speaks here, that *in mind* you have got to that side.
Rem. And the apostle Paul, too, speaks as one whose mind is there, though he had not reached it yet?
F.E.R. Yes.
Rem. And that is the force of a living hope.
F.E.R. Yes. Then you come to the closing idea (verse 22), "The glory which thou gavest me I have given them". That is a very interesting point to me; the moment the work was done -- "I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do" -- then it is that the glory side came in, everything from that point was for the glory of Christ. He was laid in the grave, He had to come to the lowest point, in that way, but then resurrection was glory; and then His being taken up to the right hand of God was glory; and then, as there, He is invested with all authority -- it is all glory. It is glory, too, in contrast to humiliation. Everything on this side was humiliation. He went down lower and lower, it was all going down, but when the work was accomplished, the work of the cross, then it is that glory begins.
Ques. Would this take us in, too?
F.E.R. Yes, I think it included us, "that they may be made perfect in one". I think we come in under those who believe on Him through their word. It is "their word" that is the link. The Lord's prayer at the beginning of the chapter was, "Father ... glorify thy Son", but then what glorified the Son in a certain sense glorified the Father. I do not think you could for a moment think that the Father had remained passive, if I might so say, during all the time that the Lord was doing His will. When the householder
{430}
in the parable had sent his only son, and they cast him out, it says, "He will miserably destroy those wicked men". It is impossible to conceive that the Father remained passive. I could not speak of the Father suffering, that would be irreverent, but when everything is finished, then it is that everything is for Christ's glory, is for the Father's glory. You cannot separate the two in that way.
Ques. Is glorifying the Father a further thought than glorifying God?
F.E.R. Well, it may be so; but "God" is a more inclusive term. "Father" is in relation to the Son, but "God" is a more general idea.
Then the Lord prays that they may be with Him to behold His glory. I do not know that I have any other thought than that which is generally held, that it is the glory which it is impossible for others to share, His *own* glory, but it is possible for them to behold.
Ques. The glory peculiar to the Son?
F.E.R. Yes, "my glory", it is emphatic, "that they may behold *my glory*"; and therefore He brings us to the Father's house, and there brings forward what had existed between the Father and the Son through all eternity.
Ques. And yet it was given Him here?
F.E.R. Yes; He takes it up in that way. All that belongs to Him He takes up as given to Him. It is just the contrast between Colossians and Ephesians. In Ephesians everything is *given* to Him, but in Colossians He *is* everything. In Ephesians He is *given* to be Head over all things to the church, He has become Man, and takes up everything as given to Him. But in Colossians He *is* Head of the body, the church, the Beginning, the Firstborn from the dead; He *is* Firstborn of all creation -- it is what He *is* and not what is given to Him.
{431}
CHAPTERS 18 AND 19
F.E.R. Chapters 18 and 19 are, in the main, historical, and for this reason are not quite adapted for a *Reading*. The details which come out in them are pretty much in accord with the gospel. The utterances before the high priest and Pilate are peculiar to the gospel. The Lord answers no accusations; they ask about His doctrine, and He answers that He had taught openly in the temple. "Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said". So, too, with Pilate, the Lord replies to no accusation; His utterances show them that He judges them, not they Him, for they were in the presence of Him who is the truth. "Why askest thou me?" really shows that He discerns the motives at work in them. The whole object of questioning Christ was to get something to go upon to condemn Him; it was no honest inquiry.
In the council it is, "Why askest thou me?" To Pilate it is, "Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice". He did not make so much of being a king, but that He might gather up all that was of the truth -- "To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice". The ground that the Jew is compelled to take here is most humiliating; they had had a history as God's people, and now they are compelled to own, "We have no king but Caesar". You cannot imagine anything more humiliating.
The human idea of truth is the setting forth of anything as it *is*; but that is not the divine idea. Truth covers all that may be known of God, both as revelation and His will; truth shows everything in its place, it is a test for everything, but you cannot connect truth with man. The Lord said of the devil, "There is no truth in him". The idea of the truth
{432}
covers the revelation of God, and the revelation of His will; this explains to me what the Lord says, "To this end was I born ... that I should bear witness unto the truth". It is said of the devil, too, that he abode not in the truth. To abide in the truth means that everything must stand in its own proper relation and proportion. A madman is a man who has lost all sense of relation and proportion, and therefore he has no proper ideas, all is disproportioned. The truth, according to Scripture, covers the revelation of God, and of His will, and therefore, in that sense, Christ is the truth. The idea that truth is the statement of a thing as it *is* has no foundation in Scripture. Man fallen is a living lie, there can be no truth about that man any more than about the devil, of whom it is said, "There is no truth in him". The statement of a thing as it is may be true, but that is not *truth*. It was a bold confession before Pilate, "To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice". Pilate afterwards seems to have had a misgiving that the Lord was more than human. Philosophers avow that they are in search of truth, but where are they going to get it? One generation after another passes off the scene, and they do not arrive at it. The Greeks and Romans were in search of it; it seems to be a long business, and what about the poor generations who meanwhile pass away? Philosophers want to get the secret of things of life, etc., but that is not truth at all, for truth is the revelation of God, and the setting forth of His will, therefore Christ is the Truth, and the Spirit is the Truth, for He is here to lead us into it.
People shelter themselves behind the statement that there is nothing certain, and therefore every man must go on just as he likes. It is only by the knowledge of God that you have any standard for things; there is no sanction or standard for social ties or anything else,
{433}
apart from the revelation of God. The validity of these things depends on the revelation of God, and if this is not accepted you may as well give up all, and people will do even that by-and-by; but they will not leave God out for nothing. They will not benefit themselves thereby. By the love of the truth a man is saved.
It is important to have simply and clearly before you, "What is truth?" The bulk of people could not give a very good answer. God would have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth. There is nothing of truth outside the operation of God's Spirit. I think that, when a man is born again, it is the beginning of the truth with that man. I saw, in one of the periodicals, that the statement of a thing, as it is, is truth; but that is not the Scripture idea of it. I might, for example, give you an exact description of Paris, and it might be all true, but it is not "truth". One characteristic of the truth is that it *abides*. Paris will not abide; one of these days I expect there will not be a trace of it left. I do not believe there is a trace of truth outside the operation of the Spirit. "Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice". All others are outside truth. We get the revelation of God's will in Christ, and the consequence is that we practise the truth.
Ques. What is the force of "love of the truth"?
F.E.R. It is the love of the revelation of God, of His righteousness and love. Faith is really the love of the truth. You believe with your *heart*, and therefore it is the obedience of the gospel, because the revelation commands the heart. Pilate was afraid and asked Jesus, "Whence art thou?" I believe he had a misgiving that He was more than human; then, afterwards, we read that Pilate sought to release Him. Pilate's inquiries were not honest, and therefore the Lord gave no answer. Needy, simple souls who came to Him He was not silent to. The Lord's silence was
{434}
more terrible than anything. Pilate assumes a great deal, "Knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?" The Lord stripped him of that assumption. He witnessed a good confession. Pilate did not own God, his only thought was the Roman Emperor.
"He that delivered me unto thee" refers to the Jew, the Jew was not alive to the gravity of the moment; he was helping on the deliverance of their Messiah to the Gentile power. After the Jews had owned Caesar as their king, Pilate heaps insult upon insult upon them, insisting that Jesus was their King, and he had that inscription written on the cross.
It is a sad picture all through, both with regard to the council and Pilate, and to the Jews; they were all in the dark, not knowing what they were doing.
The fulfilment of Scripture comes out in a remarkable way in chapter 19: 24 - 38. A soldier pierced His side, and forthwith came there out blood and water -- the blood atoned, and the water cleansed. The grace of God rose above the worst hatred of man; it was wanton brutality, and the divine answer is the water and the blood. Even the soldier that pierced His side might be cleansed.
"A bone of him shall not be broken". This shows that however unrestrained the hand of man may seem to be, God is over everything. If you want an evidence of that truth of the scripture, verse 34 would give it. What human mind could conceive that the answer to brutal wantonness should be a testimony to the grace of God?
CHAPTER 20
F.E.R. The death of Christ as seen in Luke is distinctly in view of resurrection. Death was on man, therefore all must be on the ground of resurrection. God could not touch man in grace except on the ground
{435}
of resurrection. In John's gospel it is more the setting aside of the whole state of man after the flesh, like the brazen serpent lifted up. The garment was not rent; this shows how everything was held within bounds. It is humiliating to man that he cannot go beyond what God allows, while on the other hand it is very beautiful to see the care and pity of those godly men, Joseph of Arimathaea and Nicodemus, who were in the line of God's pleasure. They came out with courage when things arrived at their crisis. They had been timid before, but it is beautiful to see how they come out now.
The Lord could not have been laid in a tomb ever occupied by another, God took care that all should be suitable. When Mary Magdalene came and found the stone rolled away she went and told Peter, and he and another disciple came, and saw, and believed. They believed the *fact*, but they did not *know* the scripture (verse 9). It was most important to know the scripture. Scripture recognises throughout the necessity of resurrection. Scripture has no meaning from end to end apart from resurrection. I doubt sometimes if they even believed the *fact* of resurrection, though they believed He was not in the tomb, for they afterwards went to their own homes.
Lazarus came out of the tomb with the grave clothes about him, but in the case of the Lord, He left them behind; not a shred of the old came out of the tomb. People cling to relics of the old order, instead of seeing that resurrection is a new point of departure. The Papists claim to have these grave clothes. For God there is nothing left, but a Person risen from the dead.
It is exceedingly beautiful to see that when there is the least evidence of affection, the Lord is at hand. "Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping", and when she had turned herself back, she saw Jesus standing -- it was affection that called Him into presence.
{436}
The Lord is always on the look-out for affection from His people, and here immediately He is at hand. Almost the first word He spoke in resurrection was "Mary". He knew her by name.
The whole purpose of the chapter is to bring into view the great truth of association with Christ in resurrection outside of all here. The Lord is not to be brought into the present order. Christianity carries us out to Him. Mary seems to be the link here in the early part of the chapter.
Ques. Do you mean between the disciples and the Lord?
F.E.R. Yes; in verse 10 we read that they went away again to their own homes, but "Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping". I think she represents the link between the disciples and the Lord. Their state was morally poor, they did not as yet know the scripture that He should rise again from the dead, and all that remained was Mary. If she was the link between them and the Lord, she was their link also with God in that way. The Lord was the testimony in resurrection, He was the light of God.
Ques. Is she the link as expressive of affection?
F.E.R. I should suppose so, she appears to be the only one who was weeping. She was "without at the sepulchre weeping".
Ques. Like a widow, she was bereft of everything.
F.E.R. Yes; it looked, for the moment, as if everything was broken. Even the disciples had gone away to their own homes.
Rem. As if all was over; so that Mary is the only link, just the one weak link which kept the thing going.
F.E.R. Apparently they see that the tomb is empty, but they go away to their own homes, and their own things. In contrast to that, Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping. What comes out is the extreme weakness of everything at the moment. Mary was the only link. I think it is a divine principle that in all
{437}
God's ways down here everything begins small; the kingdom begins as a grain of mustard seed, which is the least of all seeds -- Christ Himself was born into the world as a Babe. The disciples were the heralds of Christianity, and here we find them all more or less disheartened, and the link between them and the Lord was Mary. It is she who tells them, "They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him". Then Peter comes and he saw and believed, though it goes on to say, "For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead" -- so they go again to their own homes, and for the moment everything seems broken up.
Rem. Their thoughts do not go on to resurrection.
F.E.R. No.
Ques. What would you say is the difference between Mary and the disciples? She did not know the resurrection either, is it just her affection for the Lord?
F.E.R. She is certainly the connecting link, and it is she who bears the testimony. You see, she had affection for the Lord, and she was the first with whom the Lord established relations in resurrection. As regards the disciples, she had a place before them.
Rem. They had their interests here, they went to their own homes, Mary had none.
F.E.R. No; and she had more sense of deliverance and grace than they had, I should judge. The Lord had cast out of her seven devils; she had experienced His power, and I should say had more sense of deliverance than they had.
One point that is exceedingly important is how very personal it all is. It is not a question of doctrine, but everything is so extremely personal. Everything starts in that way from the Lord, from what He says to Mary in resurrection. He establishes relations with her in resurrection, everything had to be on a new footing, it could not be on the old footing. He was no longer
{438}
known after the flesh, but the starting-point is the Lord Himself. He takes the initiative, and sets to work to establish spiritual relations on the basis of resurrection -- but it is so entirely personal.
Rem. And her affection gains for her a kind of prominence at the moment.
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. She had become the vessel of testimony, the disciples were not. You see, if the disciples failed, the Lord finds a suited vessel, even though it be a woman.
Rem. It is remarkable that here the Lord announces His own resurrection to Mary. In the other three gospels it is the angels who announce it. Is it because the great point here is the intense personality of it?
F.E.R. The real starting-point is the Lord's own Person, everything starts from Him. Nobody who had *known* the Lord could have had any doubt as to the resurrection. I think you see that at the beginning. Mary Magdalene had no doubt as soon as it was announced to her; she knew Christ, and therefore the resurrection was no difficulty to her.
Rem. She knew He *must* rise.
F.E.R. All the scepticism and infidelity that are abroad only arise on the part of those who lack the knowledge of divine Persons. Christianity has become a matter of doctrine; they talk about the "doctrine of the atonement", and the "doctrine of the resurrection", and so on; they spend their time on doctrine, but they do not know the Persons, and therefore they are likely to be turned about by all kinds of things.
The Lord Himself, even when He spoke to the Pharisees, does not ask them what they thought of this doctrine, or of that doctrine, but His question is, "What think ye of Christ?" Doctrine, to my mind, is totally subordinate to Persons.
Rem. And His asking them that question silences them.
{439}
F.E.R. Yes; they durst not ask Him any more questions.
Ques. Would you not say that that is the great lack in our souls, that we have so little personal acquaintance with Him?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. Every one here would be free to admit that it is acquaintance with the Person that he lacks -- with Christ. The apostle says in Philippians, "that I may know him". The point is to *know* Him, that is the first thing. Mary *knew* Christ -- that is quite certain.
Rem. And if the Father is seeking a bride for His Son, the first thing must be affection.
F.E.R. If we know *Persons*, we have no difficulty about doctrine, but what you find is that people are deficient in the first elements of Christianity, they do not know divine Persons. And the Scriptures present no difficulty at all to a person who knows Christ. I believe it is true that, whenever people have questions and doubts about Scripture, it only proves this much, that they have no personal acquaintance with Christ. It is my firm conviction, and in regard to myself too; I know it in myself.
Rem. Mary knew Him as the One who had delivered her from the power of the devil, and no one less than Himself could have helped her.
F.E.R. Yes; and then, too, she had been in the Lord's company, she was one of those who ministered to Him.
Ques. In her case it was a question of affection without intelligence?
F.E.R. Well, at all events, she has been put in contrast to Mary of Bethany. Mary of Bethany had apparently faith in the resurrection, and she was not at the tomb. Mary Magdalene was not so intelligent, but she had very great attachment of heart to Christ.
Ques. And that Person was everything to her?
F.E.R. Yes; she appropriates Him in the most
{440}
wonderful way, "They have taken away *my* Lord", and then, "Tell me where thou hast laid him, and *I* will take him away". She had expected to find Him in the tomb, and she was surprised to find Him removed. I think it is a beautiful expression, "They have taken away *my* Lord" -- He who had been crucified as a malefactor, yet He was her *Lord*. I fancy that the real starting-point in her history, as with us all, was the consciousness that Christ knew her by name, He knows us personally. That is the real starting-point in Christian experience.
What you get in this chapter is the inauguration of everything, and so He calls His own sheep by name, He knew Mary's name.
Rem. And she had the consciousness of it, the experience of it.
F.E.R. Yes; "He calleth his own sheep by name" -- that is the word. That is the first great principle here. Then the next great step is that He was going to represent them with God, "I ascend to my Father, and your Father", etc. It is very much like Hebrews, He was going to be their representative. He was going up to appear in the presence of God for them, but, then, before you can understand that you must know the High Priest -- you must know the grace of the High Priest. He knows you down here, succours you, and the next step is that He appears in the presence of God for you -- that is the divine order. You see, "Mary" was the name by which she was commonly known, it was her natural name, not a name given to her of the Lord, like "Peter", but her natural name. I think it indicates that the Lord knew her in what she was down here, that is the character of the knowledge of the High Priest. He does not, in that special way, know them in *company*, but He knows the *individual*, He knows each *individually*.
Rem. Only a personal love could beget a personal love.
{441}
F.E.R. Yes; He calls His own sheep by name, that is the first principle. Then I think you learn the next lesson, it came out here in Mary's testimony to the disciples. He is gone into heaven, there to appear in the presence of God for us -- that is the next great step. And He bears their names there; just as the high priest in Israel bore the names of the tribes on the breast-plate, so Christ bears our names in the presence of God. "He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them" -- that is the way it comes out in the Hebrews. In the first few chapters He succours and sympathises, and then in chapter 7, "He ever liveth to make intercession" -- He is at the right hand of God, and makes intercession for us there.
Rem. You look upon that as individual, and the "Minister of the sanctuary" as referring to the company?
F.E.R. Ah, but you have not come to that yet; it is all individual up to chapter 8. He succours and sympathises, and then He goes to God and makes intercession -- that is for the individual; the intercession He makes for you is not the intercession He makes for me. He is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him. You have passed on in chapter 8 to another thought, He is the Minister of the sanctuary there.
Ques. Is it in His priestly character that He makes Himself known to Mary?
F.E.R. I think it is more as the Shepherd; He had not taken up the place of Priest until He was at the right hand of God. I think, however, you get the thing in principle, you have the patterns, as has been said. I think it is by priesthood that Christ makes us conscious that He knows us personally.
Ques. Is the intercession connected with failure?
F.E.R. No; rather that you may not fail, "I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail *not*". That is
{442}
just the difference between advocacy and priesthood. Advocacy comes in when you have failed, priesthood is in exercise that you may not fail.
Rem. It is rather remarkable that Peter should disbelieve the testimony of resurrection.
F.E.R. Quite so. Resurrection was his great testimony afterwards. The fact is this, it just shows the terrible state, the perversity, of people who have not the Holy Spirit. You cannot conceive a greater contrast than between Peter here and Peter after he had received the Holy Spirit -- he was a man of power then.
Rem. A similar contrast is discernible amongst people now.
F.E.R. Well, perhaps it is so; and yet you may have a mighty power and still be unable to use it, but the power is there to use. I think that describes the state of a large proportion of Christians today; they have got the power, but they do not know how to use it.
Rem. Here they had neither Christ nor the Holy Spirit.
F.E.R. No; so for the moment they were weakness itself. I think it is very interesting here to see how the truth comes out step by step, and it is all so intensely personal, not doctrinal at all, but entirely personal, it is all so bound up with Persons.
Ques. Do you mean with the Person of the Lord?
F.E.R. Yes; it is Mary, and the Lord, and the Father, and the disciples, it is a question of Persons all through.
Rem. And the doctrine is really derived from the knowledge of the Persons?
F.E.R. Yes.
Rem. The experimental knowledge of the Lord enjoyed by Mary stood her in good stead here.
F.E.R. It did indeed; and I think it must be the same with everybody as with her, that the faith of Christ has broken the power of the devil. It is the
{443}
faith of Christ that has broken the power of sin; you have believed in the heart the form of doctrine delivered unto you, and that has broken the power of sin, and therefore of Satan; you are really under the control of Christ.
The Lord bids Mary not to touch Him; He says, "Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended".
Rem. She was not to renew the acquaintance on the old terms.
F.E.R. Well, the starting-point of things now must be the Father. Christ would not be touched until He had ascended to the Father, everything now starts from the Father. It is a spiritual touch now, if you touch Christ at all; but there could be no spiritual touch until He had ascended to the Father. The Lord would not have things renewed on the old footing at all. In the eye of Christ the Father was the starting-point of everything. He Himself was to send the Spirit *from the Father* when He had gone to the Father, and therefore nothing could be really established until Christ went to the Father.
Rem. And it was to make known the Father that He came down.
F.E.R. Yes; and in all the things which Christ was about to establish, the starting-point was the Father. You could not touch Christ except and only as He had gone back to the Father.
Rem. His having been sent of the Father, the first thing was He must go back to the Father.
F.E.R. Yes; as He prays in chapter 17, "Father glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee" -- the Father was to be the starting-point of everything.
Ques. Is there not an implied contrast here to what we get in Matthew, where they held Him by the feet?
F.E.R. I think so; but the great interest of the matter to me is that you cannot know Christ now by
{444}
sight or sense, but it is, "I ... know my sheep, and am known of mine. As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father", and what I understand by that is that you know Christ outside of sight and sense -- that is the idea of it to me. You do not know any person outside of sight and sense naturally; a person might write you thousands of letters, but you will never know that person until you know him by sight and sense. Peter takes up the thought where he says, "Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory". It is the most wonderful thing that can possibly be, that you can know a Person whom yet you have never seen, and be devotedly attached to that Person; it is outside the whole range of seen things, of sight and sense. That is the way we know Christ now. To touch Him was to know Him by sense, but it is no longer to be in that way. It is a wonderful expression, "Whom having not seen, ye love" -- and "rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory" -- it is wonderful to me.
Rem. Mary did not even recognise Him by sight.
F.E.R. No, quite so. Then He makes Himself known to her, and then she wants to touch Him, that is, to know Him by sense.
Rem. But all recognition was to be spiritual.
F.E.R. Yes; and so it must be with us, for we have never had the opportunity of touching Christ by sight or sense, and yet He says, "I ... know my sheep, and am known of mine". It is not as in the case of the Jew; Israel is a flock, in one way, and will be a flock, and they will know Him when they see Him. He will be made known then, in a certain way, to sight and sense, just as to Thomas at the end of the chapter, but until He had gone to the Father, you could not know Him spiritually. In the end of the chapter the Holy Spirit is implied, and He gives you the capability of knowing what it is impossible to know
{445}
otherwise. The spiritual man knows all things, yet he himself is discerned of no man; so the Lord went to the Father to send down the promise of the Father. You know, I do not believe in the "double procession" of the Spirit; it is an ecclesiastical term, but I do not believe in it. I believe that Christ sent the Spirit from the Father -- all the language of John's gospel teaches us that.
Ques. What is meant by the "dual procession"?
F.E.R. Well, it is a vexed question between the Eastern and the Western churches, it is the "Filioque"; but what I believe is, that Christ went to the Father, and sent the Spirit from the Father. The Father sends Him, Christ sends Him from the Father. He is sent, of course, in Christ's name, and He is the Spirit of God's Son, but as to the actual sending of the Spirit, it says in the beginning of the Acts, "Having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear". And I very much prefer the words of Scripture to the creeds of men.
Rem. It is formally stated in @John 15 and 16 in that way.
F.E.R. Yes; and yet the "Filioque" divided Eastern and Western churches. The fact is, you never see truth cast into moulds, or put into a creed, without the most egregious blunders being made. All creeds are alike in that respect -- the Apostles creed, or the Athanasian creed. God would not have truth -- though it be truth -- cast into moulds of that description. It is like any Act of Parliament, you can drive a coach-and-six through it.
Then there is another point, that is, that creeds go on the principle that you can hold everything as doctrine without the knowledge of Persons, and that is the fatal mistake into which Christendom has fallen. They have the doctrine of the Persons without the Persons themselves. It is fatal to attempt to hold
{446}
the doctrine apart from knowing the Persons. Look even at the Old Testament, and the knowledge the saints had of Persons. Look at Abraham's knowledge of God -- he knew a Person, he had a personal God. Theology is just a science, a doctrine.
Rem. And taught to unconverted men like any other science.
F.E.R. Quite so. If I do not know the Father and the Son, I do not know the doctrine; but if I do know the Father and the Son, I shall very soon know of the doctrine.
I think you get a sort of progress here. He knew His own sheep by name -- Mary is typical in that way; then He goes up representatively for them; and then you get the assembly, that is the divine order. Now until Christ is known personally, and until you know that He is appearing in the presence of God for you, you are not prepared for the assembly.
Ques. You must have all your own affairs settled?
F.E.R. Yes, and then you get the assembly. Here you see it all worked out in Persons, not in doctrine.
Ques. There are two points, are there not, "My Father, and your Father", and "My God, and your God"?
F.E.R. Well, the great point was to bring them into the consciousness of association with Himself; had it been simply "My Father", it would not have been enough; it contemplates Him both as Son and as Man, that is the thought. He has a place not only in reference to the Father, but as Man He has a place in reference to His God. John always gives prominence to the Father, while Paul would give more prominence to God. John gives prominence to the Father because it is the name of relationship.
Rem. And the Lord would begin at the highest point?
F.E.R. Yes, with what the Father was to Himself. You see, He was going up -- "I ascend" -- and in a
{447}
certain sense it was natural to Him to go up; but the great point here is that He is going to the Father representatively. He is going to ascend, in that way, representatively for them, "I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God".
Ques. For their sakes?
F.E.R. Well, really to take up a position for them, to appear in the presence of God for them.
Rem. And always maintaining the dignity of His own Person.
F.E.R. It could not be otherwise; He is *Head*. I do not think He would quite speak of "My Father", as the Son; I think it is only as Man He is speaking of "My Father". In eternity the simple terms were "the Father" and "the Son".
Rem. And so God could speak of Him as "My Son".
F.E.R. "My Son" is as born into the world, "Thou art my Son".
Ques. "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work", how is He speaking there?
F.E.R. He takes up a position as the "sent One" down here; that is the position Christ had taken up here as a Man. But it would not have been true if He had not been the eternal Son. Everything in Him as Man down here takes its character from what He was in eternity. In eternity He could not say, "My Father is greater than I", but when He becomes Man the relative position is altered, modified, so He can say, "My Father is greater than I".
Well, the third point here is the assembly, I mean *in type*, at all events. The disciples are gathered together, and they are shut in for fear of the Jews, and then He comes into their midst and says, "Peace"; and He shows unto them His hands and His side. We get what corresponds with this in the Lord's supper. The Supper answers, in our case, to His showing to them His hands and His side, you get identification
{448}
there. I think it is death that brings Him into presence, that is the character of the Lord's supper. It sets forth His death, and brings Him into presence, He was known of them in that way. He showed to them His hands and His side, and He is identified before them as the One who had died for them.
Ques. And the proper effect of that was joy?
F.E.R. Yes, not sorrow; the true character of the assembly is gladness, it is impossible to be conscious of the presence of the Lord without being conscious of joy. Do you mean to tell me that you could be in His presence without being glad?
Ques. What about the hymn, "With joy and sorrow mingling"?
F.E.R. Well, what really happened was that their sorrow had been turned into joy, and He says, "Your joy no man taketh from you".
Rem. He says to Mary here, "Why weepest thou?" but He Himself had wept on the other side.
F.E.R. Yes; but she would not have wept if she had known what the Lord knew, it was ignorant affection in that way.
Ques. Had peace ever been announced to them before now?
F.E.R. No; but after that, I should not think they felt much more of the fear of the Jews. Fancy what it must have been to have the risen Man in their presence. I think if we had the consciousness of it we would not be troubled much about man. It is certain that one Man risen is worth a thousand million of dying men, a world full of dying men.
Rem. Peace is the footing on which they were to be down here.
F.E.R. Yes; He identifies Himself to them by the marks of His death, and then they are glad. The greatest gladness we can know is the consciousness of the presence of the Lord, it is incomparable joy.
{449}
Ques. Would it not have a very subduing effect upon us?
F.E.R. Yes; but I think we should be very free in it, you get true liberty in the presence of the Lord.
Then what follows on the presence of the Lord is testimony; all must follow in that order. You know Christ first as Mediator, then as Son of God, then as Priest, then as Head, and then as last Adam for testimony. You cannot meet Satan except by the last Adam, that is evident. If you attempt to meet Satan by putting forward the first Adam, or man, you will see what must come of it. But the only power to meet Satan is divine purpose in Christ -- that is the only weapon to meet Satan with. You are to be "strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might", because you are on ground that nothing can touch. That is Ephesians. You are on the platform of divine purpose in the last Adam, because all is set forth in Him. You are *rooted* in it, and now you can come out and meet all the power of the enemy. Any other way of meeting Satan is not worth considering to a person who has his feet on the reality of the last Adam.
It is as last Adam that He is a quickening Spirit, and so He breathes on them here, but that is all connected with testimony. It is not the communication of the Holy Spirit as on the day of Pentecost.
Ques. Would you mind repeating those steps again?
F.E.R. Well, you begin with Mediator, then you go on to the Son of God -- declaring God; then Lord, and the kingdom in connection with Him as such; then I think you come to the Priest -- that is quite different from Lord, but you must know Him as such, and as Minister of the holy places; then, next, you know Him as Head, the One who gives impulse and movement to the assembly here; and then you know Him as last Adam; but in all these it is but *one Person*. As regards the testimony, there is no
{450}
hope for man except in the last Adam. People attempt to accommodate the truth to this science and that science, but it is all nonsense. It is only by the last Adam that the truth can be maintained down here, and the truth is just as good as it was two thousand years ago.
Rem. So it is the sense of purpose that gives us force.
F.E.R. Yes, it does; you do not get real power on any other ground, but that is sufficient to overturn all else. If you are going to take any other ground, you had better make a compromise with Satan at once, because he has got twenty thousand, and you have only ten thousand. The fact is, you had better give it all up -- "Whosoever ... forsaketh not all that he hath" -- you must give up your ten thousand. The truth is, people are loth to give up their ten thousand.
Rem. Perhaps you would say a word as to forgiveness of sins (verse 23).
F.E.R. But they had administration before this. What you get here is, in that way, the assembly set upon its feet, so to speak, but administration comes before this.
Ques. But how is it exercised?
F.E.R. Well, there was the letting-in of the Jew, and then of the Gentile, and you see how it worked in discipline in the case of Ananias and Sapphira. It was set up first in connection with the apostles, but I should think it was only the inauguration of things. He gives the pattern of things before He goes away.
Ques. Would not Ananias (@Acts 22: 16) be an example of one exercising this administration when he said to Paul, "Arise, and be baptised, and wash away thy sins"?
F.E.R. I should think so. The great idea is that a man might act in perfect concert with the mind of Christ in heaven, and that could only be in the power
{451}
of the Holy Spirit -- man acting for Him in His absence, representative of Him. You could not have testimony going out without the assembly -- testimony is all out of gear without the assembly, all out of place. The Lord established the assembly first, and they are all gathered together, and the Lord is with them in their midst, the actual thing is there. As to the doctrine, Paul lays it all down in detail in Corinthians. I think it is very beautiful to see John, the latest writer in Scripture, writing in a way so perfectly confirmatory of Paul. John was not the one employed to set things up here, but he comes in to confirm it all by his own personal knowledge of Christ, and of what He had done and said. The gospel of John is supposed to be the last book written, at least that is what learned people say.
Ques. Would His first appearing to the company cover the present period typically?
F.E.R. I think it is characteristic of the present time. What takes place with regard to Thomas seems to be different altogether. The Lord says to him, "Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed".
Ques. Our period would be covered by the words, "Whom having not seen, ye love"?
F.E.R. Yes; as it says here, "They that have not seen, and yet have believed".
Rem. I suppose we get the truth as to the assembly first, and then as to the Jew afterwards?
F.E.R. Yes; Thomas represents something different, in a way. Then, again, the next chapter widens out, and you get there a millennial picture in every feature of it.
Ques. But Thomas is more the remnant character of the Jews?
F.E.R. I think so. Thomas is representative, in that way. Thomas was defective because he did not
{452}
believe the testimony of the others; he evidently thought that they might have been deceived, and therefore he says, "Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails", etc., "I will not believe". He says, "I will in no wise believe" -- it is a very strong negative. I suppose he thought they had been deceived by a kind of apparition. I think there are two kinds of unbelief; there is the unbelief of will and the unbelief of weakness -- you must make a distinction between the two.
Ques. I suppose that "Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief", was the unbelief of weakness?
F.E.R. Yes. I think it was the fear that it might not be true which made Thomas doubt. He would willingly have believed it, but he wanted very good evidence of it.
Rem. It is a very common kind of weakness, but it has to be recognised as such.
F.E.R. Yes; the test of it is whether or not you would be glad if it were really so. Would you *like* to be sure that He is risen? That is the test, and I think Thomas would have answered to that.
Rem. I suppose it was allowed so that he might be a typical case?
F.E.R. I think so, I think you are taught in Scripture by what is recorded, the teaching of Scripture is positive, you are taught by what is there.
Rem. And the more interest a thing has to you, the more difficult it often is to you to believe.
F.E.R. Yes, and I think with people of that description they would only be too glad to be assured of it.
Rem. They fear lest it is too good to be true?
F.E.R. Well, lest they should be deceived. The twelve disciples are not infrequently looked at as typical of the remnant, a kind of Jewish remnant, but, after the resurrection, the Lord does not address them all in that way. Thomas, by his own difficulties,
{453}
occupies that ground. In all the prophetic part of Luke's gospel He seems to address them all as in the character of a remnant, because it refers morally to the future. Then there is that expression, "Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come"; you could only apply that to them by virtue of their occupying a kind of remnant character, a remnant ground. I think it would solve a difficulty in the understanding of the gospels to see the double character that the disciples had; that they had given to them the promulgating of Christianity, and yet, at the same time, a kind of typical position as representing the Israel of the future. This has often been a difficulty to people in understanding the gospels.
Rem. The way in which Thomas speaks to the Lord is totally different from what comes out in the other part of the chapter, "My Lord and my God".
F.E.R. Yes; and the faith of Thomas is grounded on what he had seen. The earlier appearance refers really to Christians, and He shows to His disciples who were then gathered His hands and His side, and it says, "Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord". Thomas was apparently not in the commission then given to the disciples. I think the great interest in all this is found in the Lord Himself; the way in which the Lord deals with each individual case, that is the beauty of it to me, because, after all, the people He dealt with were poor things at the best. But the great interest in the passage is in the dealings, and the words, of Christ Himself, the wonderful way in which He deals with each individual soul, the way He dealt with Mary, and then with the disciples, and then with Thomas -- I think it gives you a great deal of insight into what Christ Himself was. Then another important feature of it is that it is a risen Christ, it is not simply what He had been in the flesh. You might associate tenderness, and all that kind of
{454}
thing, with Christ after the flesh, but here it is a risen Christ, we cannot know Him now after the flesh.
Rem. He takes each up in a distinctive way.
F.E.R. Yes; He takes account of their different conditions, and meets each according to that condition. Mary is weeping, the disciples are in fear of the Jews, Thomas unbelieving. His word to Mary was simply "Mary", then the word to the disciples is, "Peace", and then as regards Thomas, there is a kind of reproof. My impression is this, that the Lord can bear with anything on our part but unbelief. What tries Him most, if one might use such an expression, is unbelief. It was so with the disciples, that which tried Him most in them was unbelief: He calls them an unbelieving, faithless generation.
Rem. And that was because it showed their lack of affection, because it is "faith which worketh by love".
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. I very much doubt if Thomas ever touched Him; of course, you could not prove that he did not, but I doubt it very much.
Ques. John speaks of handling "the word of life". That would be in resurrection, would it not?
F.E.R. Yes, I think it is in resurrection there; the Lord gave them that assurance of the resurrection, that He was a real Man in resurrection; He brought that home to them, "Handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have".
Rem. And there is nothing inconsistent with the fact of the disciples having touched Him, because it was with quite another object.
F.E.R. Yes; each gospel must be taken by itself. For example, in Mark everything depended on the testimony, and everything now depends, in that way, on believing the testimony. You see it was very grave if, as we see in @Mark 16, they disbelieved the testimony, because they not only had the Scriptures, and the Lord's own words, but they had also the testimony of those who had seen Him after His
{455}
resurrection, and if in spite of all, they did not believe, it was a very grave case. The disciples were to promulgate the testimony, and everything depended on the reception of that testimony. I think I can understand the Lord chiding them for their unbelief.
Rem. They could only speak on the principle of "We also believe, and therefore speak".
F.E.R. Exactly, and I think that is what the Lord meant. He upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who had seen Him after His resurrection. Then afterwards He sends them forth -- "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel". "He that believeth not shall be damned". Everything depended and turned on faith, and therefore it was of all moment that they themselves should believe. You see, the testimony of those who had seen Him after His resurrection, and the Lord's own words, all went to confirm the previous testimony of Scripture. What you have got to see is this, that the demand of the Old Testament, what the Old Testament *must* have, is the resurrection of Christ -- without this, it is all a dead letter. Now the New Testament supplies what the Old Testament demands, and is the complete answer to everything in the Old Testament. Everything in the Old Testament, from the very beginning, demanded the resurrection of Christ. "It shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his head", and all the promises, and everything else, depended on the resurrection of Christ. "Ought not Christ to have suffered these things?" I think it is a very interesting point -- a very interesting study -- to see how every part of the Old Testament demands the resurrection of Christ.
Rem. And the faith of the Old Testament saints would have no reward except for that.
F.E.R. No; everything depended upon it.
Rem. "He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied", that is in resurrection.
{456}
F.E.R. Yes; and He is to instruct many by His knowledge. How does Christ come, if He is not risen, with the breastplate of righteousness, and the helmet of salvation, as in @Isaiah 59? I think Christ is represented in the saints down here in a twofold way; one is according to what He was in His first coming, and the other is according to what He will be at His coming again. If you put on the whole armour of God, you represent Christ as He will be when He comes again to meet the enemy, but when it is a question of the gifts, they represent Christ according to what He was when He came the first time. All the gifts that are displayed in the saints, in the power of the Holy Spirit, are with a view to this. To me it is exceedingly beautiful to see Christ, in this two-fold way, coming out in the saints down here, ministry and gift all representing Christ as He was here; and again, when it is a question of standing against the enemy, you are to put on the whole armour of God, a representation of Christ as He will be at His coming again. You want the breastplate of righteousness, and the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, to stand your ground against the enemy, and not be afraid.
Rem. I think it is a most interesting point, and opens up a great deal as to the Christian position.
F.E.R. Yes, it does; everything of Christ as He was at His first coming, and as He will be at His coming the second time, is all to come out in the church now. The church is to withstand all the influences of Satan, like Israel when they got into the land, they had to stand. The church has to withstand in the evil day, meeting the influences of the world, and standing in the presence of them. That comes about, and did come about, in the fact of saints standing in the truth of God's purpose. If they stand to that, they very soon find themselves exposed to the opposition of the enemy. I am perfectly confident of this, that the world and Satan will not suffer the maintenance
{457}
of God's purpose, neither man nor Satan will stand that.
Ques. Would you say that that was why the resurrection was so opposed?
F.E.R. Well, you see, the line that man goes on is that he does not believe anything that does not come within the cognisance of man. Anything that cannot be ascertained or recognised by man is not to be accepted. It really means that man's mind is the limit of what you are to know.
Rem. A certain professor told us that only yesterday.
F.E.R. Well, I can quite believe it. Now if I had the courage, the way I should meet that would be to say, Well, it is quite clear to me that you have no faith, because faith means that you believe what you cannot verify. There is no faith in believing what you can verify, but faith comes in when you believe what you cannot verify, just because it is the word of God.
Rem. The faith of the Old Testament saints was never verified.
F.E.R. No; look at Abraham, he could not verify the promises made to him. He came forth into the land given to him when he had no inheritance in it, "no, not so much as to set his foot on". Then look at Moses, he could not verify what he believed, he endured as seeing Him who is invisible. And so you might go on all through. You know, the assertions of men, clever men too, are astounding to me. They make assertions which really rest upon nothing but their own dictum. Why should they go and set aside Christianity? And why should I believe in the dictum of a man more than in Christianity? Christianity is all built upon the testimony of resurrection. Resurrection does not belong to history. As far as I know, history has never given testimony to resurrection, and yet Christianity is all built up on the testimony of the resurrection of Christ. But what I ask is, why
{458}
should I be expected to believe in the dictum of a man, or men, more than on the existence of Christianity, apart altogether from the testimony of Scripture? No, with all man's greatness, and all that it is possible for him to carry out, yet it remains true of a man that he returns to his dust. It is most humiliating, you know, and his testimony is worth nothing at all. Now the great thing to which the Lord appeals is, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up". After all, the Lord only came in on the line of Old Testament scriptures, He did not come in at variance with them, but it was as the answer to them. "He expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself". Then, too, the apostles come on the scene and bear witness to the scripture, but with this additional fact, that the Holy Spirit was with them. Well, am I going to put all that aside in order to believe the dictum of a man? All I can say is that the man is a madman who does such a thing. What are you going to get by losing Christ? This scene would be a scene of darkness, utter darkness, apart from Christ -- utter moral darkness. Think of my soul being left to some of these men of science or literature!
Rem. The moral world would be left without its Sun.
F.E.R. Yes; the moral world would be as dark as the natural or physical world would be without the sun.
Rem. They take away all the hope and comfort from the miserable.
F.E.R. Yes; and all that is bright, and pure, and holy, and blessed; the whole scene is left in darkness.
Now, in the record of this gospel you have only a selection of the signs; there are many that are not written in this book, "but these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name". I think that is a very important point in connection with John's gospel, that the written signs
{459}
are selected by the Spirit of God; selected, too, and recorded, that we might believe, not simply that Jesus is the Christ, but that He is the Son of God, so that, believing, we might have life through His name. His name refers you to Himself "This life is in his Son"; if you have life in His name, then you have lost your own. It is all on the principle of "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me". That is how it is you lose your own name. It is life in His Son, that is His name, and you have surrendered your own name. "I am crucified with Christ" -- well, what name has that man got? Even Christ has not got a name here, "Who shall declare his generation?" -- He has got no generation.
Rem. Except a spiritual one.
F.E.R. Well, quite so; but the world does not know much about that. He has got a great name at the right hand of God, and, believing, you may have life through His name, not in your own name. I think that is the mistake, to a large extent, with a great number of people. Too many have been bent upon having life in their own name, having life in themselves. But the very essence of the thing is that you have life in the Son, you live in His circle. He has not got any name here, and neither have you; but He is known in His own sphere. Paul always coincides with John, so you get from Paul, "Your life is hid with Christ in God" -- it is where Christ is, in God, and "This life is in his Son", as John expresses it, exactly coincides. You must first learn where His name is great, that is the first thing, where He has got renown, and that is not here. He has no renown here, but where He has got renown, you have got life, because it is in His name.
Ques. "Where two or three are gathered together in my name", that is outside?
F.E.R. Outside the world; you are gathered where He is known, and He says, "There am I in the midst".
{460}
Ques. Is it not the Spirit that leads us there?
F.E.R. It is the Spirit of Christ; but I think there is another thing, and that is the work of the Spirit, the new man, the Spirit's work in the believer; I think it is that which brings you into the sphere where Christ is. It is what Scripture speaks of as the "renewing of the Holy Spirit", that is the moral link that connects you with the place where Christ is, the mind is set on things above -- your purpose of mind. We must bear in mind that you cannot apply every Scripture to every converted person -- for instance, you cannot apply the statements of Colossians to every person, you can only apply them to those who are prepared for them. You cannot speak of them as applicable to every Christian, it is a very dangerous thing, though you do not in any way unchristianise anybody.
Ques. What would it involve to believe "that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God"?
F.E.R. I think it is just where John comes in to corroborate Paul. You see, the testimony of the twelve was to the exalted Man, that is, the Christ, that is what they bore witness to. But now John comes in to corroborate Paul, and goes back to the Lord's own teaching and works, in order to prove that this is the Son of God. There was ample testimony as to who He was in the Lord's own words and works down here, and all is brought to John's remembrance by the Holy Spirit, and comes out really as corroborative of Paul's testimony.
Ques. It does not say you are to believe He is the Son; you might almost expect it to say that?
F.E.R. No; it is as the "Son of God" that He is presented to faith today. It is the "Son of God" as become Man, "made of a woman, made under the law" -- "God sent forth his Son" (@Galatians 4: 4) presented to faith, not exactly as the eternal Son, but the "Son of God", "that ye may know that ye have
{461}
eternal life who believe on the name of the Son of God", @1 John 5: 13.
Rem. I was thinking of the last verse of chapter 3, "He that believeth on the Son", etc.
F.E.R. Well, "the Son" is used there as a test, in that way, but what is presented to faith is the "Son of God". Paul preached immediately, in the synagogue, Christ as the Son of God. It is so here. "That ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life through his name".
Rem. And the truth of His being Son of God is connected with the incarnation. Luke speaks of it, "That holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God".
F.E.R. Yes; and it is a question here of what is to be presented to man in testimony. The twelve presented the exalted Man, whom they had known in the flesh; then Paul comes in and preaches that He is the Son of God, that He came forth from God. He does not tell them about His eternal Sonship, but shows them One sent forth from God. "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee".
Rem. In the epistle it is, "that ye may *know*", who believe on the name of the Son of God; here it is "that ye might *believe*".
F.E.R. Yes; in the epistle he goes on to consciousness.
CHAPTER 21
F.E.R. This chapter comes in quite supplementarily -- the teaching of the gospel, the burden of it, was quite finished at the end of chapter 20.
Ques. It comes in in quite another character?
F.E.R. Yes; it is very remarkable in that way, it is an appendix.
Ques. And what would you say was the object of it?
{462}
F.E.R. Well, it is exceedingly important, because it gives you, in a very remarkable way, the future of Israel. It is not the believing Jew, you get that in Thomas, but it is a picture of Israel, Israel in a larger sense. That is what I understand by the hundred and fifty and three fishes caught out of the sea. As to the mere facts which come out in the chapter, they are very interesting; but they are not recorded simply for the purpose of interesting us, but they have a typical character. It is very interesting to note the disciples who are mentioned; there are seven of them, and the first three are mentioned by name, but the last four are not. And the association of the first three is very curious; there are Simon Peter, Thomas and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee. Simon Peter -- the apostle of the circumcision, Thomas, a type of the Jewish remnant, and Nathanael, of whom the Lord Himself said, "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile". Then James and John are not mentioned by name, only as "the two sons of Zebedee", and there are two others with them whose names are unknown. It is very peculiar and interesting to me, these first three. Nathanael was not an apostle at all. I think it gives you a pretty good idea of the character of the picture. The sheep and lambs whom the Lord charges Peter to feed were undoubtedly the Jews of that time. Peter fulfils his mission and dies, he suffers martyrdom. Then Thomas is representative, and Nathanael is undoubtedly representative too, he confessed Christ to be the King of Israel. Then it is very striking to see that, in the absence of Jesus, they catch nothing. There may be a certain kind of activity, but it will all end in nothing. It is my impression that men will set to work, in a kind of human way, to bring the Jews back to their own land, but it will all end in failure. Then Jesus comes and everything is changed. It is a beautiful picture, though it is given in a rather obscure way, as many things are in Scripture.
{463}
It is remarkable that John is thus employed to put out things in this symbolical and obscure way, as in the Revelation.
Ques. The morning would indicate a new day?
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. And the shore?
F.E.R. Well, it is the gathering of Israel out of the sea of nations. No one knows where to find them today, and the effort of those who try to find them before the Lord comes is all abortive. When He comes, then they cast the net on the right side of the ship, and the result is obtained; but they will never do it until the fulfilment of the Lord's words takes place, "He shall send ... and gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other".
Rem. What about "Children, have ye any meat?"
F.E.R. The Lord says things which expose people. They had not eaten much, for all their fishing; they had gone back, in that way, to what was human. Peter, James, and John had been called from their fishing, but they had returned to it, and the Lord says to them virtually, "Well, what have you got by it? You have not got much by it".
Rem. It is a question which we all have to face, how little we have got by our great activity.
F.E.R. Yes. Then we get afterwards what is deeply interesting -- the last step in the restoration of Peter. He had already been restored in conscience, but here what takes place is in order that he should be restored in heart. It answers to the third and seventh days of cleansing of @Numbers 19. He judged himself, no doubt.
Ques. What did you refer to in the third and seventh days?
F.E.R. With the unclean person there was the sprinkling on the third and seventh days. I think the conscience is always restored before the heart. The conscience is set at rest first, but a man might have
{464}
the sense that he had really judged himself, and yet be deeply conscious that he had lost communion. Here you see Peter jumping out of the boat in order to be the first to reach the Lord, but when he gets there he feels he is not free with Him. The Lord afterwards goes to the root of the matter. It is the root of the matter which He deals with, and not the actual breakdown which had occurred. There is often a kind of self-confidence in a person that puts him in the position of thinking that he has more affection and regard for the Lord than anybody else.
Rem. John speaks of himself as the "disciple whom Jesus loved".
F.E.R. Yes; that is a very much safer way of speaking. Peter gave himself credit for loving the Lord more than anybody else, but here, the one who recognised Him first was John. Peter casts himself into the sea to reach Him, but it was John who recognised Him, it was by affection.
Then as to Peter, the challenge, "Lovest thou me?" comes just corresponding to his denial. Peter had denied the Lord three times, and the Lord puts the challenge three times, and then Peter sees that he is entirely cast upon the Lord: he says, "Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee"; as much as to say, "Other people may not know it, but *Thou* knowest that I love Thee". Then it all closes up with the special commission given to Peter, and with the intimation that he was to die. With John, as regards the character of his testimony, he remains until the coming of the Lord, he brings Christ in again, as to his testimony. Peter's testimony all passes away, his special testimony and his work all pass away. He was to feed the sheep and the lambs of the Jews, and they would be merged in the church, and therefore, to all appearance, his work all passed away, and even his testimony was superseded. But John's testimony brings Christ in again in the Revelation.
{465}
Paul's testimony does not exactly bring Christ back, it is John's testimony that does that; it is John who is the writer of the Apocalypse, and he brings in the Lord's return -- he brings again into the world the Only-begotten. So the Lord says of him, "If I will that he tarry till I come". It refers to, and is identified with, John's testimony, not simply with John as a man, but as identified with his testimony, and so it abides.
Ques. Is it affection that brings Him in?
F.E.R. Yes; "The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely". It is the bride that says, "Come".
Ques. Is there a difference between the lambs and the sheep?
F.E.R. Well, only as looked at from the Lord's point of view; the Lord could discern the difference between them. You see, lambs need to be carried; they will become sheep some day, no doubt, but they need to be carried now. "He shall carry the lambs in his bosom", they have to be tenderly shepherded and cared for. It is first "feed" and then "shepherd".
Then I think it was a great mark of confidence on the part of the Lord as "the great shepherd of the sheep", to entrust to Peter now the sheep and the lambs. While He probes Peter to the bottom, He yet gives to him this distinct mark of His own confidence. It is very wonderful to see all this on the part of the Lord in resurrection. It is Christ in resurrection that you have before you here.
Ques. Did He not prepare Peter to face death?
F.E.R. Yes; because He says to him, "Follow me", and Peter follows, with his life in his hand; Peter occupied the path, with the knowledge of what it would end in.
{466}
Rem. It is very sweet to see the way the Lord lingers here.
F.E.R. Yes, until everything was done, until the restoration of Peter; Peter had to be prepared to bear witness. The Lord puts everything straight -- I think it was the Lord's object to leave, in that way, everything ready and prepared for the reception of the Holy Spirit, who was to be the great, divine Witness of Himself as the ascended One, as indicated by the Lord in chapter 15.
