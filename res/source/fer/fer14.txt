THE SANCTUARY (1)
@Colossians 2: 1 - 23
F.E.R. I think God has found a way by which He may dwell: Christ has prepared a house for Him. We have our part in that, but it is not the purpose of God in it; the purpose of God in it in regard to us is to bring us into the sanctuary. There is great gain in being brought to the house of God, but His purpose is to bring us to the sanctuary; you are brought to the sanctuary when you are prepared for it.
D.L.H. Is not the house a kind of means to an end?
F.E.R. Yes, God dwells to make Himself known. It is not only that He may be revealed; He was revealed before the house was here at all. God was first revealed, then He establishes the house that He may be known by those in the house. You get no divine teaching until you are brought to the house.
W.B. When is a man brought there?
F.E.R. When he apprehends that God dwells here by the Spirit.
W.B. How do you come to apprehend that?
F.E.R. By faith. A man accepts testimony from God, but that is not what I call divine teaching. He accepts the testimony and receives the Holy Spirit, then it is divine teaching begins. If a man receives the Spirit he has come to the house of God.
W.J. By the sanctuary, do you mean the privilege of the house?
F.E.R. Not quite, the sanctuary is something within. The house is one idea, and the sanctuary another; how far they will be co-extensive in the eternal state I could not say. The gospel is really God's testimony. When you accept that you are brought to His house, in order to come under teaching which is divine. That is in principle the new covenant; you get the new covenant within the
{2}
house, and it means divine teaching. The new covenant does not belong to the sanctuary, but it forms you for it.
D.L.H. I had thought that covenant is that God instructs us as to His intention.
F.E.R. He instructs us not in His mind, but in Himself and hence it is said, "All shall know me, from the least to the greatest".
T.H.B. Is that the limit of the teaching?
F.E.R. The only limit is God Himself; because He is the Teacher. We do not strictly come under the covenant, but we must come under the principles of it, that is divine teaching, so the apostle says to the Thessalonians, "Ye yourselves are taught of God to *love* one another", that is the effect of the love of God.
F.C. So in @Romans 5, we have what is presented in testimony, and then teaching.
F.E.R. I think so, but you get the teaching even in chapter 5: "the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts", verse 5, it begins there.
W.B. I thought that if any man learned any truth at all either about God, or himself, it was by divine teaching he learned it. Suppose I have learnt my state of guilt and sin, is it not divine teaching?
F.E.R. That is not what I should call divine teaching. Divine teaching is leading you into the light of God. The man who knows God best, knows himself best. New birth is not divine teaching, but it is divine operation. You cannot speak of divine teaching until the Holy Spirit is received.
Ques. When shall they all be taught of God?
F.E.R. It is the great point in the new covenant that people are taught of God.
J.B. What is "no man cometh unto the Father, but by me" @John 14: 6?
F.E.R. Coming to the Father is coming to Christ really for light. All the light of God is in Christ. He was speaking to the Jews at the time, and no one came to Him except the Father drew him. It is akin to @Matthew 11: 28
{3}
"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden".
J.S.A. The work of the Spirit is not the same as the teaching of the Spirit?
F.E.R. New birth is the work of the Spirit, but it is not the teaching of the Spirit. The object of coming to Christ is to be brought into rest by Christ revealing the Father. You come to Christ to be taught.
J.B. "Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me". @John 6: 45. Is not the Father the Teacher there?
F.E.R. God is the Teacher, but God draws to Christ that you may come under divine teaching. I am inclined to doubt if the Father's drawing to Christ is in itself divine teaching.
A.C. Has He not some instruction about Christ to give to the soul that feels its need?
F.E.R. You come to Christ to get living water, then it is you get teaching. You could not come under divine teaching until you get living water.
A.C. How do you know the living water is there?
F.E.R. You get it, it is not a question of knowing it is there, but if you do come to Christ you get living water. You are attracted by the operation of God, by the testimony, but the soul comes to Christ and receives from Him the gift of living water.
A.C. What is the difference between testimony and teaching?
F.E.R. The reception of the testimony is one thing, and teaching quite another. You must begin by the receiving of the testimony: faith must accept the testimony. God has set forth His testimony, and the first relation of the soul with God is the acceptance of His testimony. That is different from teaching, the idea of which I get from John's epistle: "Ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things, ... and ye need not that any man teach you," (@1 John 2: 20, 27), and in the last chapter the Spirit is the witness: "He that
{4}
believeth ... hath the witness in himself"
W.B. Where does the gift of the teacher come in?
F.E.R. Oh, but that is not the divine Teacher. There is the gift of the teacher as well as the evangelist. If you are lecturing, or if I am lecturing I am sure I have no idea that anybody is taught by me. One may be used of God to point things out perhaps to people, but pointing things out to me does not teach me. The Spirit uses me in a measure to keep the mind of God under the attention of the saints, but they do not learn from me. What I present to them may be used to exercise them, and if they are exercised they may get something out of it, because all teaching is the fruit of exercise. There are two elements with teaching: moral and intelligent, and you want both. The moral teaching is by the Spirit; the Spirit of God leads you in a way to the Scriptures, and you get intelligence in that way, but the great point is moral teaching. The Spirit enlightens you in the mind of God, but God alone can teach *Himself* to you.
D.L.H. What we want is to be exponents of the things about which we are enlightened.
F.E.R. I am perfectly sure of this that our enlightenment has gone a long way beyond our knowledge of God. It has been so with myself. I have put things out far beyond my moral stature. Take one single instance, and that is Mr. Darby: I never found a man who had the same intelligence in the mind of God, and power to apply it as he. Morally there was the stature of the man, and the intelligence corresponded to it. He was specially and divinely taught in the knowledge of God, and hence he acquired great intelligence in the *mind* of God.
The Spirit begins with righteousness and then you get to holiness in that way. You are led on and instructed. The moment you come to holiness you must bring in love. Righteousness connects itself with grace, and holiness with love. You get the knowledge of these things by the Spirit of God bringing your soul into direct contact with God Himself.
{5}
J.S.O. What about the gifts in @Ephesians 4, do you separate that from divine teaching?
F.E.R. I would in a way; there it is that the body may be built up, that instead of being children and tossed about with every kind of doctrine, they might be able to stand as men. That is all connected with intelligence. It is divine intelligence but you cannot get divine intelligence except by the knowledge of God morally. What man wants is moral backbone, and then he gets divine intelligence, the two go together. I think if you examine the passage in @Ephesians 4, it is intelligent growth, not moral. Do you remember an expression of Mr. Darby's? It used to puzzle me a good deal: he said that in divine things you learned the words by the things, and if you have not got the things you cannot learn the words.
J.S.O. I suppose the only revelation of God we have is in the scriptures?
F.E.R. Christ was the revelation of God whether the scriptures were there, or not.
J.S.O. But still Scripture is the inspired volume.
F.E.R. You have an inspired record, but the revelation of God was complete, even before the Holy Spirit came. I would not like anyone to think that I make little of the scriptures, but the real witness of Christ is the Holy Spirit: "When the Comforter is come ... he shall testify of me".
J.B. Was there any divine teaching in the past dispensation?
F.E.R. Yes, in anticipation of what has come to pass now. No one has a single bit of light until the entrance of God's testimony.
J.B. Teaching is on the line of love, not light.
F.E.R. Quite so, God begins by enlightening.
W. "That I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended", is that divine intelligence?
F.E.R. I think it is more apprehension of mind. The first thing that God works in a man is desire, and then He satisfies it. It is a wonderful thing to me what
{6}
you find in @Psalm 132, the Spirit of God produces desires in David, and then satisfies those desires.
J.S.O. Have the labourers no part at all in forming the stature of the christian?
F.E.R. In a way; for instance, I have had thankfulness expressed for something I have put out, by those who have been helped by it, and I think in that way, the teacher gets the credit of it.
J.S.O. There is a very real link formed in that way, between those ministering and those ministered to.
F.E.R. In John's epistle there is the teaching in which he does not recognise man's hand at all and there is the teaching of the Spirit of God which forms a person's intelligence. A teacher may show you the mind of God, and it is an important service to have the mind of God expounded to me, that brings me into exercise so that I may get the good of it.
D.L.H. How did this discussion begin?
F.E.R. It began with the house of God, the place of divine teaching. The object of divine teaching is to bring us to the sanctuary. Very few people know the sanctuary because they are not prepared for it, and they feel it. The sanctuary is where God's glory rests.
D.L.H. With regard to the sanctuary, Mr. Darby's observation is very important, that unless you know the thing you cannot understand the word.
F.E.R. It is a great thing to get an idea of the sanctuary. It is certain to me that the love of God cannot rest in the house of God as it is now, but there is a spot in the house where it can rest; you could not touch the sanctuary except by the house.
W.B. Everyone who has received the Spirit has touched the house.
F.E.R. Teaching and discipline are going on in the house. That is not love resting, but there is a spot where God's love can rest, because everything is according to His glory. The great point for us is to reach that spot, but in order for us to reach it everything depends upon
{7}
our knowledge. We ought to grow in the knowledge of God.
J.S.O. But you do not make little of gift?
F.E.R. Oh no, I make a good deal of gift; I should not make light of it. If a man gets a ministry from the Lord, he has to fulfil it.
D.L.H. That passage quoted in @Ephesians 4, really shows that the teaching comes from Christ, "He ascended up on high ... and gave gifts", it speaks of the present care of the Head for the body.
F.E.R. Yes, and the gifts are connected with the forming of the saints in the divine nature and intelligence -- you want both.
J.S.O. Does the Spirit of God work in connection with their being formed in the divine nature?
F.E.R. I am certain He does.
J.B. No servant could form them in it.
F.E.R. No, nor does any servant have the idea that he can really teach as the Spirit of God.
Ques. In what sense does the Spirit work in the teacher?
F.E.R. The Spirit produces very great exercise and that kind of thing. Let anybody try their hand at it and see the terrific conflict it is all along. You find that every influence is opposed to you, or rather to Christ I should say. Every influence is opposed to spiritual progress, hence if you try to maintain the mind of God before the saints, and are really concerned at all that they should make advance in the mind of God, you will find what a terrible power there is against it.
Ques. Why do you speak of the house and the sanctuary in connection with this chapter?
F.E.R. The object of the chapter is to prepare you for the sanctuary; we have the teaching and terms of it in Hebrews, but in Colossians we have the substance. It is written to the gentiles. You have to recognise your place as risen with Him. You are priests, the priestly company, and then you are quickened with Him, so
{8}
that you really have the antitype of Aaron and his sons substantially, not in terms. Jordan lies between the house and the sanctuary. You only get to the sanctuary through death and resurrection. As risen with Christ you are outside every order of man down here. A risen man is of a new order. It may be the same identity, but he is of a new order. It is not only that you are risen with Him, but you are quickened with Him, and thus participate in His life and you are qualified for the sanctuary. Colossians and Hebrews run together pretty much. Colossians brings you over Jordan to Gilgal. Risen and quickened with Christ corresponds to @Hebrews 10. "By the which will we are sanctified", you are in association with the High Priest for the service of the sanctuary. He is the true Aaron and the Aaronic family are those who are risen and quickened with Him.
T.H.B. You do not get the assembly in Colossians?
F.E.R. You get the Head and the body and that is in connection with the sanctuary.
J.S.O. And philosophy and the like, would greatly hinder.
F.E.R. I would not like to offend anyone, but to me science and philosophy are all rubbish the moment you look at them from the moral point of view. What good will they be when you come to die? When you get above you will understand things better than men ever do by science down here.
{9}
THE SANCTUARY (2)
@Hebrews 10: 1 - 25
F.E.R. It is necessary to connect in the mind this chapter with the second.
J.S.O. There must be the understanding of chapter 2: 11 before you understand the sanctuary.
E.R. Chapter 2 is what is for Him; here it is our side?
F.E.R. The point in chapter 2 is Christ Himself. We only come in incidentally there. We come in when we are prepared for it as in chapter 5. Before you are prepared for the sanctuary, there must be a certain amount of acquaintance with Christ Himself
J.S.O. In His character as Priest.
F.E.R. You begin there, that is the first thing in connection with the house; then you get other functions connected with Him, as the Mediator of the new covenant -- the Minister of the holy place. There is a progressive acquaintance with Christ which qualifies people for the service of the sanctuary. God's mind for all saints is the sanctuary, but another question is, how far are we qualified for it?
D.L.H. The point is how we may approach and worship God as revealed.
J.S.O. You must have association with the Priest, and know the way in.
F.E.R. I think so. The idea of being sanctified is you are sanctified through the offering of the body of Christ, the flesh is gone.
H.B. What is perfected for ever, in verse 14?
F.E.R. It only goes to purgation, when you have no more conscience of sins you are perfected. Conscience is the connecting link between the responsible man and the man in Christ, and the point is that the conscience should be purged. All is new in the christian, "If any
{10}
one be in Christ, there is a new creation", but there must remain a link with the responsible man so long as we are here, and that link is conscience, but it is perfected, and you have no more conscience of sins.
J.S.O. The light that acts upon the conscience brings in all the light of the new. The conscience remains in the light of it. You bring in another measure altogether.
F.E.R. Yes, nothing enters the sanctuary except what is according to Christ. The ideas of most of us are very indefinite in regard to the holiest.
Ques. Is entering the sanctuary collective?
F.E.R. We must all enter individually, but it is a question of state. The idea of worship is connected with the company in connection with Christ, and brings in a collective thought, but boldness to enter the holiest must be a question of individual suitability.
D.L.H. If we really had a sense of the holiest it would give a wonderful character to things.
F.E.R. Yes, but where there is a large company come together it is impossible that all there understand entering the holiest, so that they do not enter. Take the Corinthians or the Galatians, the company there did not enter.
J.S.O. Apart from state there can be no sense of being of the priestly company.
F.E.R. That is the progress from the house to the sanctuary. You are learning the Priest to prepare you for association with Him, that you may serve God in the sanctuary.
J.H.B. The Hebrews were no more in the enjoyment of privilege than the Corinthians.
F.E.R. I do not think they were, it is written to lead them into it.
J.S.O. As to their actual state they were low down.
F.E.R. There was a tendency among them to turn back.
J.H.B. How does the sanctuary stand in relation to reconciliation?
{11}
F.E.R. Reconciliation is preparation for it, and comes in at the end of chapter 9. He has made plain the way by which you enter. Reconciliation is deeper than a purged conscience, and refers to the removal of state which does not come on the conscience. You get it in the thought that we are sanctified by the offering of the body of Christ which means the end of us in flesh.
D.L.H. The idea of the body would appear in the Supper?
F.E.R. All that condition has been brought to an end in Christ's death, in order that we may live in the love expressed in His death. As far as I know the sanctuary depends to a certain extent upon God's ways being for the present hid. God's ways will not come out publicly until the new heavens and earth, until good and evil are solved. We contemplate God's ways in the sanctuary while they are hid. There you get a wonderful apprehension of God's wisdom and ways. I take up the thought of the way by which He gives effect to the purpose of His will. The millennium is God's ways governmentally, not morally. New heavens and a new earth are the moral result. Righteousness dwells there. God has before Him the ark of the covenant, the mercy-seat, and the cherubim, and if we have boldness to enter the holiest, that is what is before us.
J.S.O. We get into the knowledge of it all by Christ.
F.E.R. Exactly, what expresses infinite wisdom to me is that you should get the expression of God in a Man. The ark of the covenant and the mercy-seat have their antitype in Christ. God is perfectly expressed in One who is a Head for man, and hence you have the most unmistakable security for eternal blessing. Nothing can go wrong. God rests there, and we rest there because we are brought to moral perfection.
J.S.O. It is a mere question of time bringing it all out.
F.E.R. It is a great point in Hebrews that the Spirit
{12}
of God binds the two functions of Apostle and High Priest together. You have God expressed in One who is perfect on Man's side.
J.S.O. That gives depth to the epistle.
F.E.R. Hebrews and Colossians bring you to the same point of association. Neither takes you to heaven, It seems to me people have a poor idea of divine wisdom how it exceeds human wisdom which comes to nothing. Human wisdom cannot deal with man's state.
D.L.H. It is what is said in Corinthians that it comes to naught, and we speak God's wisdom in mystery.
F.E.R. If wisdom means anything it means resource, the light of God comes in. In @Proverbs 8: 20, it is said "I lead in the way of righteousness". That is Man. The One who leads in the way of righteousness is wisdom.
D.L.H. Is that the idea of His being made to us wisdom from God?
F.E.R. Yes, He is our resource because He is God's resource. The mercy-seat is the point where God puts Himself in communication with man, that is in Christ; and beneath the mercy-seat is the ark of the covenant, also Christ who could say "Thy law is within my heart".
J.H.B. Is eternal life enjoyed apart from the company?
F.E.R. It is not enjoyed apart from Christ. In @John 4, the object of the well of water is to bring about in you attachment to Christ, and if you get that you come into association with Him.
J.H.B. Is eternal life linked with the sanctuary?
F.E.R. In the sanctuary you are really outside of death, and in association with Christ.
J.H.B. May there not be something in our individual experience that answers to that?
F.E.R. I think not. But supposing the service of God went on through the week, what then?
{13}
J.H.B. But that is not practicable is it?
F.E.R. I see no moral reason why it should not be continued all the week.
J.H.B. There might be the desire to recur to the sanctuary all the week.
F.E.R. But your individual path and life would take its tone from the sanctuary.
D.L.H. In that respect the priests lived too, though they had a good deal to do with natural life and relations. They had to remember they were priests.
F.E.R. And so have we, in our life we have to take care that we do not do anything unworthy of a priest. The bulk of christians today know nothing beyond individual christianity. You cannot get anything properly corporate except beyond Jordan.
J.S.O. It is important in ministering to begin low for the benefit of those who are there, though as to yourself you may be much further on.
F.E.R. I think so. I should suspect that the wisest way is to minister at the lowest point.
D.L.H. Ministering from the lowest point, would be from the point where the minister himself is.
F.E.R. Otherwise it would not be worth much. My fear is lest you get a kind of assumption on high ground without the necessary foundation. The effects of that may be some fearful apostasy, like going back to church and becoming a clergyman again or the like. I should think that sort of thing is because there is something rotten in the foundation. The foundation is important, and I daresay many were struck with Mr. Darby, he was always working away at Romans.
P.R.M. Would you say some more about the new Head for man?
F.E.R. You get that in the ark of the covenant: Christ is the testimony of God. You contemplate that in a way, and learn what characterises God's testimony. When you come into the sanctuary I think it is the glory of God that is before you; you apprehend God's glory,
{14}
everything is in perfect harmony, that is righteousness and love are in perfect harmony.
J.S.O. In a Man who is Head.
F.E.R. That is the point; righteousness is harmonized with love. The mercy-seat must be founded on the ark of the covenant. God could not put Himself in communication with man apart from a Man. You cannot conceive any other way, and that Man was One who was not under the judgment of God.
J.McK. God has spoken to us by His Son.
F.E.R. Exactly; prophets were only like conduits or pipes though they spoke by the Holy Spirit.
H.B. Is chapter 1, the antitype of the ark and mercy-seat?
F.E.R. The idea is there. God has spoken in Son, that is the mercy-seat.
D.L.H. Do you get the two ideas in @John 17; the declaration of the Father's name, and then love in them?
F.E.R. Quite so, and also in John's epistle, "He is the true God and eternal life".
J.N. Does truth ministered objectively produce the subjective?
F.E.R. You will not get it otherwise. My idea of ministry is presenting God, and that brings in at once the moral element.
J.McK. Is it the object to bring us to the sanctuary?
F.E.R. To bring us to God.
P.R.M. What is the bearing of the blood in connection with the sanctuary? What about Christ's entering?
F.E.R. He did not require blood to enter, Aaron did. In connection with the consecration of the priests, blood was not carried into the sanctuary.
J.H.B. Did not Christ enter in the power of His own blood?
F.E.R. Oh no. That is not the connection. He has come in the power of His own blood and entered in having obtained eternal redemption. Everything is effected for God in the cross, and Christ goes in as the
{15}
risen Man of another order. The priest wanted blood to cover him as under death, but Christ goes in not as a Man under death, but as One who could not die.
J.S.O. Could you say a little more about the consecration of the priests?
F.E.R. The consecration of the priests gives the idea of priestly privilege, and was normal; what Christ has done is presented in contrast to the day of atonement, when the priest went in with blood.
J.S.O. How do you connect the boldness to enter with blood?
F.E.R. It is never applied to us in the holiest; we want it outside. There are three steps for the christian, (1) he comes into the court of the house; (2) he is part of the house; and (3) he is in association with Christ for the service of the sanctuary. Everyone begins with the court of the house, and there he learns the value of the blood. Next he is part of the house, a living stone; and then he is in association with Christ for the service of the sanctuary.
J.S.O. Responsibility was settled at the court.
F.E.R. Exactly; if you have anything to say to sin, it must be at the court not in the sanctuary. The bulk of christians never get beyond the responsible christian.
J.S.O. Do you think it is a question of entrance here?
F.E.R. Yes, the moment you pass that way, you are done with all that blood applies to.
D.L.H. You cannot connect sin or imperfection with association.
F.E.R. People are slow to accept this because they do not like the fellowship of His death, though they believe in it. They are not prepared to hate their life in this world. It is astonishing if you come to analyse your own thoughts at all, how much you are affected and influenced by different things connected with earth; we like to put everything in order down here. I find it so with myself. It is a great thing to be free and to have things suitable to Christ, not yourself.
{16}
B -- d. What is the living way?
F.E.R. Living always connects itself with God, and the world to come. I have been interested of late in relation to it. Everything is living and in contrast to a world dominated by death. There is the living God, Son of the living God, church of the living God, the living way: it presents God to us in relation to a living order of things. The living way is to the living God. The moment the Son came out He is the revelation of the living God. The moment He becomes Man He is the pledge of another order of things. All is living now.
D.L.H. All live to Him, to God.
F.E.R. Yes. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are dead for men, but for God they live. It is a wonderful advance when you apprehend the living God, and all connected with Him. He is the Saviour of all men, but all men are not in connection with the living God.
J.H.B. Christ could not be holden of death.
F.E.R. That is very important, it shews the glory of His Person.
B -- d. What is dedicated through the veil, His flesh?
F.E.R. It is the new and living way. He has come out that way, and we go in that way. He really comes out from the heart of God to the cross, to reveal the love of God, and we go back the same way as He from the cross to the heart of God. The veil is His flesh.
{17}
THE ARMOUR
@Ephesians 6: 10 - 20
J.S.O. What is the difference between entering into the truth of the sanctuary and being seated in the heavenly places?
F.E.R. I think you must come out in conflict from God but you must go in to come out. It is true of Christ; He has gone in to God and He comes out from God when He comes to take up His rights. The same must be true of us, we have to go in to come out.
D.L.H. Would you say a word about the heavenly places?
F.E.R. Oh, it is a question of entering into the love that would have me there; it is the soul getting a full entrance into the purpose of divine love. I think it is the idea of resting there. Nothing short of that will really content the love of God. I gather that from chapter 2: 4 "but God, being rich in mercy, because of his great love wherewith he loved us" etc.
J.S.O. What is experimental is properly the conflict.
F.E.R. I think so. Entrance into divine love is experimental in a way. You enter into divine love which has its pleasure in having you with God in His own habitation.
Ques. What is the difference between the heavenly places and the sanctuary?
F.E.R. I think the sanctuary is connected with God's glory; it is entering into the secret of God. Take Stephen, he entered the sanctuary when he looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus -- he saw the sanctuary. The heavenly places is really God's own habitation. Divine love will have the saints there just as God will have Israel in His own land.
H.C.A. The heavenly places are usurped now by the powers.
{18}
F.E.R. In a way but they will be turned out.
J.S.O. Stephen as an individual saw the holy place whereas you would speak of heavenly places in connection with the company.
F.E.R. Not as to the sanctuary.
H.C.A. Conflict is not connected with the sanctuary.
F.E.R. With Stephen it was a question of being full of the Holy Spirit. I connect God's glory with the sanctuary. The way to enter it is in the secret of God. Heavenly places is an actual place, the sanctuary is not. The sanctuary is light on God's part and is moral. Heavenly places means heavenly places. @John 14 is a place. Seated in heavenly places is put abstractly. It would go too far if the expression '*Christ Jesus*' were left out. *In* Christ *we are*.
D.L.H. It is a question of the counsel of God.
F.E.R. It is counsel made good in Christ and in us in a sense; God has given us that place in Christ. As a matter of fact you are on earth in conflict but at the same time you have a place there.
W.J. It is the apprehension of that which brings you to the sanctuary.
F.G. Is the conflict heavenly life on earth?
F.E.R. Heavenly life is the equipment; conflict is that you stand here in the place of the Lord -- you take up the conflict which the Lord began. He set Himself against the devil to undo his works and the place of the christian here is to take up the conflict.
F.G. I was asked yesterday if the assembly was the conflict.
F.E.R. You would get into great confusion if you made the heavenly places and the assembly the same place.
J.J. It does not mean that the conflict is in the heavenly places.
F.E.R. No, the source of the power of wickedness is in heavenly places; we have to meet the influences down here. It is a question of Satanic influences on
{19}
earth, their seat is in heavenly places and they affect men on earth. It is a contrast to Israel in the land meeting carnal things, fighting the Lord's battles.
D.L.H. The effort of the spiritual wickedness is to shut people out of the good of the heavenly things.
F.E.R. I think so. You have to take the "whole armour of God". You begin with yourself.
T.H.B. Is the conflict individual, although you must be in the sense of the company to be in the conflict at all?
F.E.R. I think so, but it is spoken to them collectively. It is the whole christian company which is to be strong in the Lord and in His might. You cannot occupy the inheritance until you claim it. You see that in the Lord; He rode into Jerusalem on an ass as Zion's King. He claimed the inheritance in a way by testimony before He comes into the actual enjoyment of it. The same principle is true as to us; we have to claim it before we enjoy it.
J.S.O. The Lord has taken it already.
F.E.R. Quite so, and we have simply to stand there. It is wonderful to think that everything belongs to Christ -- He is Head of all principality and power. We are strong in the *Lord*, we take up what began with Christ. It is not that we are strong in Christ, but in the Lord; He is against the devil. If we are going to enter upon that ground here we must have the armour, the spiritual equipment.
W.J. Is the armour the state?
F.E.R. Equipment lies in state. You will not be able to avail yourself of the power of the Lord if you have not the equipment.
J.S.O. It is like the disciples who could not cast out the demon.
F.E.R. Exactly. If you lack equipment you will not have the power of the Lord.
T.H.B. Is equipment and state the same thing?
F.E.R. Spiritual equipment must be in state -- in
{20}
detail it is the breastplate of righteousness, etc., etc. -- it is all state.
H.C.A. Is chapter 6 the enemy disputing the entering of the heavenly places?
F.E.R. I think it is really the enemy seeking to keep Christ out and the rights of Christ.
W.B. Keeping Him out from where?
F.E.R. From all that belongs to Him. The climax of the enemy's effort is in antichrist. That is the point to which everything is working now to set up antichrist against Christ.
J.S.O. The question is what place is Christ to have?
F.E.R. The devil brings about a master stroke when he sets up antichrist and gets him the support of Babylon. The western world is used to back up antichrist.
T.H.B. The saints are set here to hold for Christ what He holds in heaven.
F.E.R. I think so; you have to stand for your own inheritance just as Israel had to do; they had to fight for their own inheritance, we have to fight in the way of testimony. Christ has got the inheritance as Head of all principality and power and we have to stand in the truth of that here.
J.S.O. It was the same with Israel, it was Jehovah's land they had to take possession of to hold for Him.
F.E.R. It is the same for us. Everything is gathered up in Christ and we have to stand in the truth of it. I have been greatly struck with the liar and the antichrist in John's epistle -- the liar denies that Jesus is the Christ and antichrist denies the Father and the Son. That is always the form of error. The unitarian will admit Jesus but not that He is the Christ. He was a man here -- the Son of Mary -- but John's point is that *He was the Christ* the Anointed, in whom the will and pleasure of God could have their full place. Antichrist will admit the fatherhood of God but denies the Father and the Son. You find both of the denials in the unitarian, they go very much together. If you admit the
{21}
revelation -- the Father and the Son -- you will be prepared to admit that another Man has come in, a Man of another order entirely and that is Christ. It is a new beginning, a new point of departure, and a new Man and order of Man. That is what '*The Christ*' means and it involves the setting aside of man after the flesh.
W.J. Would you say a word about the armour?
F.E.R. The armour is all characteristic. Certain things are given to us in the way of light and truth, but then they become characteristic and they are armour when they become characteristic. You may apprehend righteousness but we are to be characterised by it and formed by the light. You apprehend it by faith but if it is a breastplate then it becomes characteristic. Truth is given to us as divine light, but, at the same time, you are to have your loins girt about with truth.
W.B. The breastplate of righteousness is practical.
F.E.R. It is practical.
H.C.A. Is armour state?
F.E.R. It must be to be armour. No holding of truth merely would be armour.
W.B. Righteousness would come out in practical acts.
F.E.R. Righteousness is the demands of rights on God's part and if you admit His rights you will carry it out and so you will the rights of your neighbours.
J.S.O. The instant the Babylonish garment was there Israel was without power.
F.E.R. There was failure of practical righteousness, God's rights were denied. Covetousness came in, and that always denies God's rights. Covetousness means that something that is not of God has the supreme place in the affections -- it is idolatry and greatly interferes with God's rights.
W.B. What is the preparation of the gospel of peace?
F.E.R. You have to walk in peace in a scene of moral confusion to which peace stands in contrast. The christian walks in peace. Feet refer to walk and mean practically
{22}
the sense in the soul that what caused the confusion has been removed from God's eye. In the offerings I see three things -- the burnt-offering, the meat-offering and the peace-offering. In the latter I see the cause of disturbance and confusion removed and we have to enter into that. I want to be clear of the man who has been removed and to walk in the light of it.
W.J. The contrast is in @Romans 3 "and way of peace they have not known". Verse 17.
F.E.R. Exactly, there is a way of peace and it lies practically in the exclusion of the man who brought in disturbance; otherwise Jew and gentile could never walk in peace. Christ is our peace because both are gone in His death. Christ has made peace; He is our peace and He gives us His peace and we are to walk in peace here. When you look abroad and you see the confusion, it is a very wonderful thing to apprehend that the cause of it has been removed from God's eye.
J.S.O. It is only a question of time and God will bring in new heavens and new earth.
F.E.R. Exactly. Feet give the idea of walk; we become aggressive by the sword of the Spirit.
T.H.B. How does the sword come in as regards state?
F.E.R. The point is to be in the state to hold the sword. A sword is not armour, it is more than defensive. The armour is protective and the sword aggressive.
T.H.B. What is truth?
F.E.R. Truth puts everything in its place.
W.J. It is adjustment.
F.E.R. It is the expression of things as they are, everything in its proper size and proportions.
J.S.O. Christ is the truth and puts everything in its place.
F.E.R. Truth is summed up in two things, the revelation of God and the Man in whom God's will has its place. You see everything in the light of God and Christ. Stephen saw the truth in the glory of God and
{23}
Jesus.
W.J. You get that in @Psalm 73 -- in the sanctuary.
F.E.R. There you see the glory of God, the ark of the covenant and the mercy-seat. Nothing else is there to be seen except the light of God and Christ. If you take a very wicked man there is no truth about him; if he comes out in all his wickedness he is not the expression of things as they are; it is only for a moment for he will come into judgment some day.
D.L.H. What is the difference between truth and light?
F.E.R. They are very much akin. Light is more connected with exposure, it makes manifest and is objective. Truth is really the expression of things as they are, the revelation of God and Christ who is before Him and every one of us ought to be content with that.
{24}
THE WITNESS BEFORE CONFLICT
@1 John 5: 1 - 21
F.E.R. I suppose in a sense, the witness would come before conflict. The witness is the witness, and the conflict is to maintain it. The first thing is to understand what the witness is, otherwise you could not understand the conflict.
D.L.H. Is the witness that God has completely set aside one man, and brought in Another?
F.E.R. I think so. The point is that eternal life is in another Man, the Son of God.
D.L.H. So that the Spirit's work is on that line?
F.E.R. Yes; the introduction of the second Man puts aside the first, and not only that but when Christ was born into the world, He was a Head for man -- Head of every man. It comes out fully in resurrection, but in principle it was there when the Son of God became incarnate.
D.L.H. Does not the expression "This is he that came by water and blood" convey that thought?
F.E.R. I think so. He came in to remove what the first man had left behind him -- sin and death.
D.L.H. The moment He was there, He was God's Man, but He had to remove the first man.
F.E.R. Yes, headship is a place of pre-eminence, and He takes the first place. The best illustration I know of is the Speaker of the House of Commons: he is the first commoner. He is one of them, he belongs to the House, but he is the first commoner, the head of the House. If the Commons went into the Lords, they would be headed by the Speaker, but the Speaker is not lord of the House, he is head of the House, and is commonly spoken of as the first commoner. The recognition of the Head is by faith. Faith recognises Christ because He is the testimony, and faith recognises and receives the
{25}
testimony.
W.J. What is believing that Jesus is the Christ?
F.E.R. Christ is the testimony.
W.J. In what way was He made Christ in the Acts?
F.E.R. It is in resurrection He is made Lord and Christ. All is taken up in resurrection by Him. Jesus speaks about Christ in @Luke 24. "Thus it is written, and thus it behoved the Christ to suffer, and to rise from among the dead the third day". In resurrection He was vested with all the authority of God, but at the same time the Christ had to suffer. The only thing God had to say to man in Christ was "not imputing their trespasses unto them", because Christ was under His eye. Christ's presence was the final test for man, but there was no idea with God of His being accepted. He was born to be set aside. It is very remarkable what is said in @Luke 2, "A light for revelation of the Gentiles," and then "the glory of thy people Israel". That shows what was in the mind of God in connection with the birth of Christ, at the same time light comes to man and he cannot help being responsible.
J.McK. It is the responsible man you preach to?
F.E.R. Yes, if you had grace to go and put the truth of the gospel before man, he must be responsible for what he hears.
J.McK. Would you present to man the headship of Christ?
F.E.R. You must. It is impossible to present the gospel without presenting His headship. If you announce the simplest things in the gospel, repentance and forgiveness of sins, it must be in the name of the Head. You must present the Head because God's overtures to man are all in the name of the Head of every man. Headship brings in the presentation of grace in His name. He had died to acquire repentance and forgiveness for every man, and it is preached in His name.
D.L.H. Is the idea of headship limited to pre-eminence or is there any thought of direction?
{26}
F.E.R. There is that thought morally, not authoritatively. My head does not direct authoritatively, but it is natural to it. The Speaker of the House of Commons gives guidance and direction to the House.
W.B. Is there also the idea of receiving from Him as in @Colossians 2?
F.E.R. Yes, He is the medium of communication, "from whom all the body ... increases with the increase of God". Another, and scriptural idea is that of husband and wife. The husband is guide to the wife, and supplies come by the husband, he is pillar and guide.
T.H.B. Does headship involve mediatorial work?
F.E.R. I think so, because the One who is Head to man, is also the Revealer of God. The One who declared God, has become Pillar and Head of the universe. That is God's mind and thought about Him. It is His glory as Man, that He is that, and the consequence is all will be upheld by One who is competent to do so. In the Psalms you get "The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it". (@Psalm 75)
E.R.B.R. How do you take the headship of Christ to every man?
F.E.R. God addresses Himself to every man in the name of the Head. The real point as between God and man is Christ. Every man is responsible to hear God. He is a Saviour but He is that by a Head. Apart from Christ man has no Head at all. The introduction of a Head is to bring man within rule, and if he does not accept the Head, it only proves him to be lawless; and when lawlessness is headed up in antichrist it will only be to come under God's judgment.
J.McK. Could you go up to any man in the street, and claim him for Christ?
F.E.R. No, I should proclaim to him repentance, and forgiveness in the name of a Head. Christ is Head of every man, but I could not say that every man belongs to Christ.
{27}
J.McK. Is not man denying the Lord that bought him?
F.E.R. That is referring to a professed christian.
J.McK. How would a christian deny the Lord that bought him?
F.E.R. The passage refers to one who takes that ground, he may not be really a christian.
H.C.A. Lawlessness shews you do not approach God in that way.
F.E.R. It shews that man has not accepted God's appointed Head. The first thing is to receive the testimony of Christ in His name.
H.C.A. Is that why stress is laid on the name in John?
F.E.R. Yes, everything is in a name at the present time.
H.C.A. The Lord sets Himself as a ground of approach to God.
F.E.R. He is Head of every man, so that in Him God can approach man. I have been much helped in seeing that Christ's death was both declaratory and sacrificial, because God was declared, and He died for man. God's righteousness was declared, and the grace and love of God set forth. All came out in His death, but it was sacrificial for man.
H.C.A. What is the witness of the water and the Spirit and the blood?
F.E.R. The witness is that God has wrought to effect His purpose. John says "God so loved the world", Christ Himself was the witness to that. There was the declaration of God's mind. In the epistle John says "God has given to us eternal life; and this life is in his Son". It is witnessed by the Spirit, but the fact is the witness. The witness changes character somewhat because Christ is not here bodily. The water and the blood shut man out; the Spirit brings in what is of God.
D.L.H. You get the same thing in the Son of man lifted up.
{28}
F.E.R. Exactly. The witness there was Christ Himself.
E.R.B.R. What is the difference between the water and the blood?
F.E.R. The water refers to moral cleansing, the blood to expiation.
D.L.H. You get the negative and the positive in the witnesses.
F.E.R. Yes, in the three witnesses. The water removes what is morally unsuitable and the blood is the removal of that for which man was responsible. It is death, the end of a man, to which the blood witnesses. You could not get expiation without the end of a man. The end of man was death "God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh".
J.H.B. Is it right to say that the blood is for God, and the water for man?
F.E.R. The blood is the witness to man not to God. The water is cleansing from the world system, and the blood is expiation; you are clear as in @Hebrews 10, "by one offering he hath perfected for ever", and the Holy Spirit is witness. The water means washing from the pollutions of the world, it is death to the world. Christ's death must involve our death, and it is that all may die as far as I understand it.
A.E.W. Atonement was complete before Christ died?
F.E.R. Atonement and sacrifice is that you might never come into judgment; you have to accept His death. The first thing for a converted person is baptism. The eunuch wanted to be identified at once with His death. The world to him was Jerusalem, and instead of going back to Jerusalem like the two on the way to Emmaus, he went on his way rejoicing.
J.N.B. Why is verse 6 put in that particular form?
F.E.R. To bring before us that the history of the first man is completely closed. There always had been in a sense, water, but Christ came by water and by
{29}
blood. By there being water before I mean, that all the communications of God had death in view.
D.L.H. In @Hebrews 6, it speaks of the doctrine of washings.
T.H.B. Would you say a word about verse 9?
F.E.R. There is the witness, and it is that God has given to us eternal life, and it is in His Son. There is a company that have the Son, and are in the Son, and they are conscious of having eternal life: that is the witness for the moment. Christ was the Witness here, but now it is the church, and the witness of the church is dependent on association with Christ. The gospel is so very weak because the witness is such a failure. The gospel depends upon the church, and you get very little power in the gospel, if you have not got the church.
The church is the witness of the love of God. There is the conscious witness of the Spirit, and he that believes has the witness in himself; but then there is the public witness that God has given to us eternal life, and it is added "He that believeth not God hath made him a liar". The epistle is an advance on the gospel of John.
The Lord prays in @John 17, for the unity of those who believe on Him, that the world might believe that the Father sent Him. If the saints were in the consciousness of eternal life, they would be the witness of God in the world, and if men did not believe the witness of God they make Him a liar. You see the immense importance of the church as witness. In Revelation the church fails and Christ comes in and says, I am "the faithful and true witness", but that is what the church ought to have been.
W.B. I should have thought the witness was found in the scriptures?
F.E.R. The witness was here many a long day before the scriptures were written. Unity was the witness, "That they all may be one ... that the world may believe that thou has sent me". The point to me is this, the gospel depends upon the witness. The gospel is
{30}
not the witness, but the church, and if the witness is a failure it must seriously hamper the gospel. Life is the witness and it is in unity, or not that exactly, but unity is essential to life. Life is in spiritual affections. The moral import of unity is the will is set aside and shut out, and life comes in in consequence. Life is in the Son, and it is put in the place of witness to the love of God expressed in the Son.
E.R.B.R. Where is the witness now, if the church has failed?
F.E.R. You will never get it much here now, but we want to get into the divine idea, from which you get great good.
D.L.H. There is great power there.
F.E.R. I would not have christendom or any part of it at any price.
W.J. Is "holding forth the word of life", the same thought?
F.E.R. Yes, only more individual there.
J.McK. The witness was not obscure at Pentecost. What is the gospel?
F.E.R. It is glad tidings, an announcement. It is not a moral witness, it goes forth from the church. If you could get the church in order, what an immense activity in the gospel there would be. The gospel is to enlighten, but then it is to bring people into the witness. The point for people today is to be in the witness, and that is by receiving the Spirit but the gospel is the means by which they receive the Spirit.
W.J. What is "we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world"?
F.E.R. That was apostolic. We could not say we have seen and do testify, but we take it up from the apostles. The gospel was first given to the twelve, but it has been deposited in the church, and the evangelists go out from the church.
D.L.H. The gospel we try to preach is in christendom, which we would not have at all if things were right.
{31}
F.E.R. No, christendom is confusion worse confounded.
{32}
THE GOSPEL
@1 John 5: 6 - 13, 18 - 21
F.E.R. The subject last time was the witness, I think.
D.L.H. Yes, had you not something on your mind in connection with the gospel?
F.E.R. Yes, I think it is the thought of God that the gospel should have the support of the living witness. The thought I take up from @Matthew 16; before the Lord gives the keys of the kingdom to Peter, He speaks about building the church. The keys of the kingdom followed upon the living witness, and as a matter of fact until the assembly is there the gospel could not go out, it was dependent upon the church.
J.McK. What about Peter on the day of Pentecost?
F.E.R. The church was there before Peter preached; he went out in the testimony of the kingdom.
J.S.O. You get the principle in the Spirit saying, "...he that will, let him take the water of life freely". @Revelation 22: 17. There is the living expression as well as the proclamation.
F.E.R. Behind the proclamation there is the living witness. I do not think you get the gospel in power if there is not the living witness. The early days were days of power in the gospel, but behind and connected with that, there was the living witness.
W.B. How do you apply that today?
F.E.R. The great thing for us is, to look to what is within.
W.B. Do you mean that the assembly should be evangelistic?
F.E.R. If you have things right within, you will have a great deal of energy in that way. We have to look to the condition of things within -- the living witness in the saints -- and then the proclamation would take
{33}
character from that. The divine way has been to establish the witness here.
D.L.H. In verse 11 of the chapter from which we read it says: "And this is the witness, that God has given to us eternal life; and this life is in his Son". Is it in that connection that you would speak of the gospel going forth?
F.E.R. Yes, Israel were God's witnesses; they had taken that place.
J.S.O. You would identify the Spirit with the living witness?
F.E.R. That is it.
D.L.H. That really creates a subjective condition in the saints?
F.E.R. That is really what we have to look for.
W.B. And when you do not find it how do you produce it?
F.E.R. You yourself have to become the witness. Israel were the witnesses that God was the true God, one God. The Son came in as the witness of the love of God, and was the expression of His love, and now the witness of it is maintained in the church, until Christ comes again, then He takes up the witness. He is the faithful and true witness, and in the meantime the church is the witness to the Son. The church has broken down, but if you had not the church, you would have no witness whatever here of God's love. The point is that God has come out in love now. He did not come in love to Israel, but as the one God in contrast to idols. The moment the Son of God comes, He is the witness and expression of God's own love, and that witness is continued in the church.
J.S.O. In spite of the external breakdown, the church is still the pillar and ground of the truth.
F.E.R. The body is here; the truth of the body runs with this chapter. Paul takes it up in his own light and connection, and John in his, but the truth of the body and what comes out here, go together. What comes out
{34}
here is the record that God has given to the saints eternal life and that life is in His Son. The body is the witness of Christ, it is His body. Christ lives in the body, the body lives in the light of divine love because it is the body of Christ. *The body* is the witness, not what the body does. You get the same thing coming out here in principle, God has given to us eternal life. The Son was the witness of God's love, and now the church is the witness because God has given to us eternal life in the Son, and on account of its place in the Son, the witness of God is livingly continued in the church.
J.S.O. How do you view the water and the blood?
F.E.R. They witness to us. The Spirit is the truth and we witness now. "He that believes on the Son of God has the witness in himself;" @1 John 5: 10. We are become the witness, because God has given to us eternal life in the Son, just as the body is witness to Christ. "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" @Acts 26: 14. The body was witness to Christ, and eternal life in the saints is the witness of God concerning the Son.
J.S.O. It says "and the three agree in one". @1 John 5: 8.
F.E.R. That is to one point.
W.B. What place do you give the scriptures in connection with the witness?
F.E.R. They tell you what the witness is.
W.B. You do not mean to imply, that the church is a teaching body?
F.E.R. No, but the testimony of the church has to be accepted; it is an element in the responsibility of man.
W.J. There is a difference between teaching and expressing.
F.E.R. The church is taught, but the point is what the church is.
J.S.O. It must have a testimony as well as Israel.
F.E.R. Yes, if Christ has come you must have eternal life, if there were not eternal life it would be a
{35}
proof that He had not come; eternal life must be somewhere. The prayer in @John 17 describes it in the way of unity and affection. He prays for those who should believe on Him *through their word* that they may be all one, etc. The saints were one in the Father and the Son. There was a unity and reciprocal affection and that was the witness to the world that the Father sent the Son.
J.McK. The state of the saints must greatly affect the witness.
F.E.R. We want to come to the witness ourselves to get at the reality of eternal life. It is not that you can restore the witness, the witness is completely obscured and the only thing to be done is, individually to seek to return to the witness.
D.L.H. That characterises the remnant.
F.E.R. Yes, you return to all the characteristics of the original, you must get at the truth of these things individually, which would result at our being knit together. Not being able to restore the thing in its completeness, is no excuse whatever for not getting back to it individually.
J.S.O. To understand eternal life you must know the meaning of the water and the blood.
F.E.R. The Spirit is the positive side, the water and the blood are the cleansing and expiation side. The Spirit is the true relationship into which we are brought. If the witness to us is effective in us, we then become the witness to the Son. The water and the blood witness to man's state. The Spirit is truth positive, the expression and power of the relationship established by God in Christ. Each one has to know the witness in himself and if it was known in power we would be drawn together in unity and give witness to the Son. That is what God has established in the church here. The body runs parallel with it. It is a divinely appointed witness to the Son of God. That is the testimony. In the proclamation you have all the support of the witness and the power and vitality of it. It was so in early days, when the
{36}
church was in power, a living power according to God, in the reality of eternal life outside the world. You can understand what a support it was in the proclamation, because the reality of the love of God was with it, in the expression of it. Today the proclamation has to a very great extent to go out without it and is consequently weak. We have to get things right within.
D.L.H. The individual servant must be a witness.
F.E.R. Yes, Paul exhorted Timothy to lay hold on eternal life to which he was called. It was essential to Timothy, and is to every one of us. You cannot get the church restored, but nevertheless God's principles never vary and you cannot plead that a change of things here is sufficient ground for departing from divine principles.
J.McK. If we cannot get the church up to it, are we not responsible to get the local meetings up to it?
F.E.R. The point is to get oneself up to it. There is nothing more powerful than example. In 2 Timothy, and Titus, Paul is an apostle according to eternal life. When the witness has failed, that is the point to be reached and is of the greatest importance. It was pressed upon Timothy to lay hold of it: In Ephesus the church has failed as a witness, but the prominent idea in Smyrna is life; life really brings you back to the proper place of the church. We have to remember that this epistle was written when the church had failed as a witness.
D.L.H. John really wrote the last of all.
F.E.R. He speaks of many antichrists which existed even in his day; it was the last time. The great thing is to lay hold on eternal life.
J.S.O. You do not get the structure in John, but, the moral force and effect of everything in the church.
F.E.R. @John 10 helps us greatly. As Shepherd of the sheep He leads them out; then He is the door of the sheep, whereby they are saved, and go out and in and find pasture. Then He is the good Shepherd that gives His life for the sheep that they might have it abundantly: then He is the one Shepherd, and then He gives them
{37}
eternal life. That is the witness, there is one flock and one Shepherd, which is really the heart of Paul's doctrine.
W.J. Does not the gospel in a way go with the epistle?
F.E.R. As to the application of the truth the epistle goes with the gospel. The gospel is that you may have eternal life, that is the setting forth of that which came out in Christ: the epistle is that you may be conscious that you have it. In the gospel it is what is true in the Father and in the Son; in the epistle what is true in Him and in us. John's writings come in confirmation of Paul's. Nothing came out in the ministry of Paul but what came out in the ministry of Christ. Paul added nothing in the way of truth. To maintain that it was so would be very serious, because the Spirit sealed a complete testimony, and nothing could be added to it. Christ did not leave anything unrevealed, all came out, but not in public testimony. John comes in late to shew that what was really descriptive of Paul came out in Christ. There was a great deal which came out in Christ which was not committed to the twelve in public testimony. I think that one would admit that the Spirit sealed a complete testimony.
H.C.A. Has not the testimony been limited to what is said rather than to what the church is?
F.E.R. The point is, not what the church says, it is not a teaching body. The witness is what the church was in. There are only two things to be witnessed to now, the love of God and the Son. All that is for man is involved in the two.
Ques. Can you witness to anything of which you are not conscious?
F.E.R. You do not witness to it, it is to be witnessed in you. Eternal life was set forth in Christ. He was the beginning of it; it is continued in the saints and it characterises the age to come. God has come out in the revelation of His nature, and eternity depends upon
{38}
that. Eternity is filled with the love of God, and love in the Son. When God's ways have been worked out, there is nothing but love.
J.S.O. That is the priceless treasure that the church is loved in the Son.
F.E.R. Quite so.
W.J. Are the three last verses a summary?
F.E.R. Yes, and a most striking one.
D.L.H. In connection with the scriptures as bearing upon this subject, how do, you take this, "Search the scriptures"? @John 5: 39.
F.E.R. He says "Ye search the scriptures, for ye think that in them ye have life eternal, and they it is which bear witness concerning me". All Scripture bore witness to Christ, and until He came they had nothing but the Scripture, but now things are there in Him and continued in the present day because He has come, and now the Spirit is here as the truth; but that is all very different from what it was before.
D.L.H. The testimony runs now in a living line.
F.E.R. It was living then in a sense. It was a prophetic testimony all the way and God maintained it. We have scripture still, but then you must not use it to displace the truth that the Son of God has come.
Ques. What is the word of His grace?
F.E.R. The word of His grace was the expression of it. The *activity* of the Spirit of God is really to bring us to obscurity, the *use* of the Spirit is to enable us to detect what is wrong. The Scripture cannot put us right, it is the work of the Spirit. The Spirit uses His own way. I cannot prescribe what the Spirit shall use.
The use of ministry is to enlighten, it cannot go further. Divine teaching is not by the Scripture. No one can describe what divine teaching is.
{39}
THE SPIRIT AS WITNESS
@Acts 2: 22 - 36
F.E.R. I suppose Peter could not carry out the commission which the Lord gave him until the witness was here. We have had the witness before us and this chapter is interesting in that way. Peter had a commission from the Lord, but in order to carry it out, he had to wait till the witness was here -- the Spirit of God.
D.L.H. And so it was in regard to @John 20, as well as @Acts 2, because there the Lord gives them a commission "As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you".
F.E.R. Only you do not get the Spirit as witness there. "When the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father ... he shall testify of me". What took place in @John 20 was not the fulfilment of that because the Lord speaks of sending the Comforter from the Father. The Spirit came to witness to the glory of Christ. What comes out in chapter 20, is connected more with chapter 4 than with chapter 7.
J.S.O. It is connected much more with their own personal state.
E.R. How do you understand the expression "Which proceedeth from the Father"?
F.E.R. It is in what has been accomplished; everything proceeds from the Father. The Son proceeds from the Father, and also the Spirit. "No one can come to me except the Father who has sent me draw him". "All that is in the world ... is not of the Father". Everything proceeds now from the Father.
J.S.O. Is the Lord's breathing on them in John to maintain them as a separated people, until the Spirit should come from the Father?
F.E.R. Mr. Darby said that the difference between @John 20, and @Acts 2, could not be at the present time. In
{40}
@John 20, the Spirit is connected with life, and in @Acts 2 with the body. In the introduction of things you are allowed to see the distinction of things.
J.S.O. In @John 20, it was a divine Person bringing them into a new position with Himself.
F.E.R. I think so, The whole point of that passage is association with Himself, in the new position in which He was as Man. In @Acts 2, there is no breathing on them. It is a very great point to see that the gospel is dependent on the church.
J.McK. In what way?
F.E.R. The Spirit testifies of Christ. You want the living witness for real power in the gospel. The preacher is not the witness to Christ; it is the church or rather the Spirit in the church.
J.McK. The apostles here were witnesses.
F.E.R. But the Holy Spirit was the witness. They were witnesses in detail; they had been with Him from the beginning.
D.L.H. Is the point on your mind that the individual testimony of the apostles was not separated from the witness of the Spirit in the church?
F.E.R. Yes, nor was it intended to be separated. Their witness really was dependent on the witness in the church.
J.S.O. You must abstract a good deal now because you must leave room for the church failing as a testimony in its witness; and yet look at it as it is under God's eye, in connection with the Spirit.
F.E.R. That is the practical difficulty. You must get abstracted from the outward state of things to get any idea of the witness at all. The Spirit of God is not the witness apart from the church. "We are his witnesses ... and the Holy Spirit also which God has given to those that obey him". Peter says that. The apostles were personal witnesses of the death and resurrection of Christ, and therefore they had a witness peculiar to them, their own witness, but you do not get them starting out until the
{41}
real witness was there. For instance they could not bear witness that God had made that same Jesus both Lord and Christ, that was dependent on the Spirit.
J.S.O. Would the knowledge of that preserve the preacher in accord with the church?
F.E.R. All the preaching is made dependent on the witness. When the tabernacle was in movement the Levites were entirely dependent on the priests. The priests had to go and cover up the vessels, and the Levites had to take their charge and directions from Aaron and his sons. That is a great point in connection with the testimony.
D.L.H. Would you say a word about the apostles not being able from their own knowledge to witness that God had made Jesus Lord and Christ?
F.E.R. It refers to the exaltation of Christ and they did not know that -- a cloud received Him out of their sight -- but the Holy Spirit came and reported that He was at the right hand of God. If you speak of the Spirit as witness, you cannot separate it from the company.
D.L.H. That is, the Spirit must have a vessel.
F.E.R. Christ prepared the vessel, and now you have the witness of the Spirit in the vessel. That was really the witness to the people at Jerusalem which substantiated the preaching of Peter. That is the place of the church as the pillar and ground of the truth.
D.L.H. The only thing is to get to see what the church is normally.
J.S.A. What is going on today is an attempt at great gospel effort but without the church?
F.E.R. Yes, and the whole thing is simply rotten.
E.R.B.R. Does the evangelist go out from the church?
F.E.R. He should be a real witness himself.
Ques. Is there not a sense in which the Holy Spirit is with the servant?
F.E.R. No service can be carried out but by the Holy Spirit. Every one ought to be an efficient levite,
{42}
and be directed by the church in a way. I do not mean that a man is to go and get his direction from the meeting, but I desire that every soul should be in the reality of Aaron and his sons for himself.
J.S.O. The preacher should be so in the understanding of what the church is in connection with the Spirit that his testimony might take character from it.
F.E.R. That is the point.
Ques. How do you understand "Separate me now Barnabas and Saul"?
F.E.R. That is very important because it is the Spirit in the assembly. It was all said in the assembly, and the assembly laid hands on them. If one wants to go forth in power, one must be in the reality and power of the church.
J.S.O. There is a character connected with the testimony, that has at the bottom God's mind.
D.L.H. An evangelist goes out to seek souls, but to seek them in connection with what is being done by the Spirit. It is not merely a question of getting souls saved from hell, and right for heaven, but of connecting them with what God is doing.
F.E.R. The evangelist wants to bring them into what he himself is in. You get the principle in Paul, "I would to God ... all that hear me this day, were ... altogether such as I am, except these bonds".
H.C.A. A free lance kind of preacher has no base to return to.
F.E.R. He is so extremely defective himself. Preaching is not the test of a man, but priestly service is, because you cannot bring the flesh into that. There may be a good deal of flesh and natural energy brought into the preaching. The point is, let us see what a man can do before God, not before man.
H.C.A. Levitical service is severed greatly from priestly.
F.E.R. Very largely. A great deal of the preaching
{43}
today is with a view to people being converted and then letting them drift off to anything.
D.L.H. Yes, the principle is they are all right for heaven.
F.E.R. The evangelist's work is to make them all right for earth.
Ques. What do you mean by what a man can do before God?
F.E.R. Priestly service is all towards God. The priest has discernment in regard to the leper, but at the same time priestly work is Godward and connected with the sanctuary. A man said to me -- a well-known preacher -- 'If I want help and direction in regard to my service, I should go to my brother evangelists', but I advised him that he would do much better if he consulted the most spiritual.
Ques. What is "inheritance among them that are sanctified"?
F.E.R. Inheritance of course is present. The way in which you get the inheritance now is by the Spirit, who is the earnest of the inheritance. The inheritance is really reigning with Christ. You are to be here now for the will of God. God brings you to the sanctuary, but the *immediate* object of the gospel is that men may receive the kingdom. In principle Peter preached the kingdom, the exaltation of Christ, not in terms but in fact, and they received the kingdom, and were baptised. They came under the moral sway of heaven in receiving the word of Peter. You cannot get an idea of christianity except in connection with the Spirit in the vessel, then you get an idea of the real power of christianity down here.
J.A. The gift of the Spirit has been lost sight of.
F.E.R. The apprehension of the Spirit's presence has brought us where we are.
Ques. Where does the evangelist's work end, and the teacher's begin?
{44}
F.E.R. The teacher comes in in the way of continuation, but it is very difficult to draw the line. The evangelist in a general sense would be more to enlighten souls at the outset, and further instruction would possibly be taken up by the pastor and teacher. The truth would be maintained before the minds of people by pastors and teachers.
J.McK. In the present state of things one has to be ready to do anything.
F.E.R. But I think you must maintain the reality of gift. The gifts are here in the distribution of the Holy Spirit and you must allow for the reality of gift. The great witness is the Holy Spirit. The apostle committed his gospel to the church. The testimony was handed down in the church, and it has been maintained by the church. Everything here for God is in the Spirit. The church is the pillar and ground of the truth, though the Scriptures have authority, and we are responsible to test everything by the Scriptures; what we have to face now is where is the world?
J.N.B. To whom is witness borne now?
F.E.R. Well we are in the midst of christendom. The world was distinct when Christ was here. It meant the Jew, and the Jew all through John is treated as the world, and the world was convicted when the Holy Spirit came, but He came to those who were outside the world. What we have to come to today, is the judgment of things morally, you cannot judge of it as they did at the beginning when the Holy Spirit came. Everything outside the saints was the world, but we cannot judge in that way because we are in christendom and hence we have to judge morally, and that is the importance of John's epistles. All that is in the world is not of the Father.
J.S.O. @John 16: 8 is more connected with the Spirit, and His presence here.
F.E.R. It is the presence of the Spirit but the Spirit
{45}
must be in the vessel. When people come back to apprehend the church in its proper character, they get a sense of the position of the world.
D.L.H. In @Acts 2, the presence of the Holy Spirit was taken note of by man, by what they saw and heard.
F.E.R. Yes, there is another important point: the witness which the Holy Spirit brings that Jesus is Lord and Christ. I think the idea of Lord is authority as against the power of evil, and Christ is the idea of Head; the Holy Spirit witnesses of both.
Rem. The acceptance of that testimony brings salvation.
F.E.R. It is a wonderful witness which is maintained here by the Holy Spirit not by us, not in doctrine but in power. We are to be strong in the Lord, and in the power of His might. The witness of the Holy Spirit is efficient in the church, there is power there, and in addition to that there is gift, so that men go forth as heralds to preach.
D.L.H. Does gift connect itself with the title Lord?
F.E.R. Yes, because gift is established down here against the power of evil, and it is made good by the Spirit in man, so that they can stand against the power of evil.
D.L.H. Does the death of Christ bring in the counsel of God?
F.E.R. He has taken up the position of Head, that forgiveness in His name may be announced to every man, and that every man may get living water. Mr. Darby once said you could go up to a man in the street and tell him that he ought to be answering to the Head.
T.H.B. In what way ought he to answer?
F.E.R. He ought to believe in Him. Every man is not a member of Christ, still Christ stands in relation to every man, though every man is not in relation to Christ. Lordship as far as concerns the church is coextensive with the faith, and baptism, @Ephesians 4. He is Head to every man as God is God to every man. Much of the
{46}
preaching has been carried on without the name; it has been left out too much; forgiveness is preached in His name. The evangelist has to enlighten souls. Adam is a type of Christ as Head.
{47}
POWER
@Acts 31 - 26
F.E.R. In @Acts 2 and 3 you get the two great principles of christianity, namely, the witness and the name. There is the witness of the Spirit and the power of Christ's name. What is connected with the name is power.
J.S.O. Does the name imply, that the One whose name it is, is present?
F.E.R. Yes, it is the power, or rather the renown of the One who is not here.
J.S.O. The name carries with it the faith of all that He was here.
F.E.R. You can anticipate all that will be known at His coming because His name carries everything. It is very important to apprehend where the power of christianity is, particularly in a day of departure such as we are in now.
J.McK. There was a display of power here which we have not now.
F.E.R. It is all a question of faith in His name. It was through faith in His name. If there is an apparent lack of power with us, it is because there is a lack of faith in His name.
J.S.O. Still you may have greater results morally than what are here in this miracle.
F.E.R. We must take the chapter as it stands. I have no doubt that lame man was a picture *of* Israel. It is the fulfilment of Isaiah; "Then shall the lame man leap as a hart". Before there was any act of power the Holy Spirit had come. The first point was to account for the presence of the Holy Spirit, which the apostle does in chapter 2. Chapter 3 is distinct from chapter 2: the point in it is the name.
J.S.A. Does the name go further than being made
{48}
Lord?
F.E.R. Every interest of earth is carried up to heaven in the person of Christ. Nothing has been let go, all is carried up to heaven.
Ques. What are the interests of earth?
F.E.R. The restitution of all things, of which the prophets have spoken. God had many interests on earth but they are carried up to heaven in Jesus glorified.
J.S.O. Every purpose of God has its centre in Him and therefore all power is committed unto Him.
F.E.R. Yes, he came down to earth to take everything up to heaven in His Person and therefore the heavens must receive Him until the time of the restitution of all things. Everything has now to come out of heaven.
D.L.H. Does faith in His name refer to Peter or the blind man or to both?
F.E.R. To Peter I thought. It was the apostle's faith in His name which brought about the raising up of the lame man.
D.L.H. The testimony was received by the man?
F.E.R. The point is it acted on the man. Peter and John really took the initiative, not the man.
D.L.H. The man had nothing to begin with; how do you apply that now?
F.E.R. My impression is this, that everything begins with faith in the name.
D.L.H. That would greatly characterise the preacher.
F.E.R. I think so. It is not only the faith of an apostle, it may be anybody's faith. The point in this chapter is really showing the secret of power, real power down here. After all what appears to be power in the world is not power at all. For instance, armaments, they are not really power, they only tend to destruction.
J.S.A. There is really more power in moral things than in material.
F.E.R. There is no real power outside the name of Jesus. What tends to destruction and to promote the
{49}
pride and glory of man is not power to me, I see no power in it.
J.S.O. The point at the moment was that the power was in the name of the One they had crucified.
F.E.R. Exactly, it was the glorified Man whom the heavens must receive until the restitution of all things.
J.S.O. Another thing in the chapter, is that it is power displayed in grace.
F.E.R. The lame man was a picture of Israel. He had been impotent from his birth and was about forty years old. The power of His name will be revived in Israel and they will be raised up.
J.S.O. In the same way as the remnant were added to the assembly in chapter 2.
F.E.R. Exactly, the power of His name will raise them up. 'Name' is the renown of the One in heaven whom God has glorified. The fact is this, that such a tremendous deal is gathered up in the name that it is difficult to give any definite idea in regard to it.
D.L.H. I suppose that this was all in the way of testimony here?
F.E.R. Yes, at the beginning of every dispensation you get set forth what would characterise that dispensation, and the two great principles characterising christianity, are the witness and the name. The witness brings in the church because the Spirit is given to them that obey Him, and the name brings in power.
J.S.O. Both necessitated by the absence of Christ.
F.E.R. Exactly, you see in them the true substance of christianity, what is abiding and cannot be touched. A man has no power in this world beyond his faith in His name.
J.S.O. It is very important to get an idea of the character of the dispensation.
F.E.R. That is a point of the last moment, and you get it set forth at the outset. The first thing for us is to be in the power of the witness -- you must be in the light of the church -- no man can really come out in power
{50}
without support, a man cannot do without support, and he must either have the support of the Spirit -- the witness -- or else he will lean on christendom. Take any man who has left us, a man who had the place of being a servant, and without exception you will find that every man falls back on the support of christendom. Somebody told me two days ago, that he happened to be going through the Strand and went into Exeter Hall, upon looking into one of the smaller rooms, he saw there a brother who had had a great name among us as an evangelist surrounded by some twenty young women and a harmonium being played. On enquiring he was told that this brother was conducting a mission in connection with Y.M.C.A. so that he had fallen entirely upon the support of christendom. Man must be supported in some way either by the Spirit or christendom, but you will not get the support of the Spirit if you ignore the church.
Ques. Will not the Spirit keep a man up to his light?
F.E.R. It will keep him toward the light. Our work is to enlighten. God can bear with a very great deal from people going towards the light, but it is another thing altogether when they are going away from it. If a man wants to be in real power, the power of the Spirit, he must recognise the church.
D.L.H. It is perfectly obvious that the Spirit would support such as had God's interests near their hearts.
F.E.R. I cannot conceive of a man getting the support of the Spirit who does not recognise the vessel of the Spirit, the Spirit is not here apart from the vessel.
J.S.A. And he could not have the Spirit without being connected with the church.
F.E.R. The fact of having the Spirit brings him into the church.
J.S.A. So that practically he denies the church.
F.E.R. Exactly, he is denying the truth of his own existence. Where people carry on their work by the support of christendom they help on christendom and not what is for God. People are converted and they go to the
{51}
systems and give their light to the systems, that is to christendom.
J.McK. I suppose you can only have the Spirit's support as we are going on with the Lord.
F.E.R. You must be in that which the Spirit has come here to form and to maintain here, the house of God and the body of Christ.
J.McK. Take those gone out from us, had they the Spirit's support while they were with us?
J.S.O. They were responsible for the light and position in which they were.
F.E.R. Exactly.
T.H.B. They might have the light of the church at one time, and be judicially blinded.
F.E.R. It is very difficult to say. A man may go very far in a way, and yet turn away as did the Hebrews.
A.E.W. Light is no evidence of power.
F.E.R. You will not get power without light.
J.S.O. God will yet accomplish in the remnant what was accomplished in this man.
F.E.R. Exactly. "Then shall the lame man leap as a hart and the tongue of the dumb sing". The point for us, is what have we got? there is no hope for Israel for the moment. It is remarkable what comes out in the end of the chapter "*Ye* are the sons of the prophets" etc., and "in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed". What He did to Israel was really the beginning of His purpose in regard to all the families of the earth. Peter says "To you first". It was first to the Jew, but the testimony was to go out to all the families of the earth, "Thus it is written, and thus it behoved the Christ to suffer, and to rise from among the dead the third day; and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem".
J.S.O. And so Paul was converted with that object "I will send thee to the nations afar off".
F.E.R. The resurrection has placed Christ in relation
{52}
to all men. After the flesh He was limited to Israel in a sense. That is what the apostle means by saying to Timothy "Remember Jesus Christ raised from among the dead, of the seed of David, according to my glad tidings". Resurrection put Him in relation to all men.
Ques. Do you take raised up in verse 26 as resurrection?
F.E.R. Oh no, but the point in the verse is 'first', "To you first". The presence of Christ here among the Jews was really only the beginning. "God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself".
J.S.O. And in the death of Christ everything closes with the Jew, on that ground as regarded the promises, they had forfeited everything.
F.E.R. God carried out His purpose in the raising of Christ.
J.S.O. Christ is never spoken of as head of a race, though He is head of all men.
F.E.R. He is head and centre of every circle and the church is His body. In @Romans 5 He is put in relation to all men.
Ques. "... such as the heavenly one, such also the heavenly ones". Is it head?
F.E.R. I think so in a way, the heavenly are all in the body.
D.L.H. Would you say a word about the head?
F.E.R. I cannot understand for a moment how God could approach man in grace apart from a head, apart from a head there is an impossible barrier between God and man because God's judgment lay upon man and God could not ignore His own judgment. The way God has set to work is to introduce a head, and that head has taken up every liability of man, and now in the name of a head, repentance and forgiveness of sins is preached to man.
D.L.H. When it says "Through our Lord Jesus Christ" is it on God's part manward?
F.E.R. Yes, authority, administration and lordship,
{53}
is all against the power of evil and we stand in His power, Righteousness comes in with His position as head, Lord brings in salvation.
Ques. Do you connect "Power over all flesh" with Him as head or as lord?
F.E.R. As 'last Adam' He is head to all men, but all men are not in Christ as in @1 Corinthians 15, there it is the saints. He as priest stands between the living and the dead. The head is the priest, but He represents the living not the dead. He is head of every family, every circle.
D.L.H. God has now a man entirely to His own satisfaction.
F.E.R. In preaching you have to bring a man to righteousness, the gospel proposes righteousness for God, and a man's first necessity is righteousness and salvation follows upon that.
J.S.O. Righteousness is in view of salvation.
Ques. What is "Firstborn of all creation?"
F.E.R. He is pre-eminent, the beginning.
J.S.O. He is judge of living and dead too.
F.E.R. The same One who carries righteousness to all men, is appointed judge of living and dead. I should like to be here in the faith of His name, in the import of it, what is set forth in Him.
{54}
THE SUBDUING POWER OF THE LORD
@Acts 9: 1 - 22
F.E.R. It seems to me that you get here a new point of departure, a starting point, which is Christ in glory.
D.L.H. Stephen's death brings things to a crisis.
F.E.R. He sees every divine interest of earth carried up to heaven, and chapter 8 is the completion of it. In chapter 9 you get the new starting point -- Christ in glory.
J.S.O. In what sense does chapter 8 complete it?
F.E.R. Stephen's testimony was, that Christ was Son of man and he saw every interest carried up to heaven; but in chapter 8 His life is taken from the earth, and the curious thing in regard to the eunuch, is that he gets light going away from Jerusalem, and not when he is going to it.
J.S.O. In seeing the glory of God and Jesus, Stephen got as much for his own soul as Saul did afterwards.
F.E.R. I think he did; he saw everything secured in Jesus and carried up to heaven.
J.S.O. He saw things beyond the testimony he bore.
F.E.R. Yes, that was the case with the apostles too. Peter had more light than he bore testimony of. This chapter brings in and is full of the activity of the Lord. You get the idea of it in @Philippians 3: 21, you get the Lord who is to subdue all things to Himself. All the order of things which would have had its climax in the glory of Israel is displaced, and the Lord begins afresh. The first thing is the church and He takes up Paul to be a witness to the gentiles. They come in first.
D.L.H. Saul was really a witness to the propensity of the Jew.
F.E.R. He comes in to show that the best thing on earth is antagonistic to Christ. The best thing was hostile to Christ, which is very humiliating.
{55}
D.L.H. It is interesting the way in which the eunuch perceived the force of baptism as connecting him with the One whose life was taken from the earth.
F.E.R. In baptism you leave the world, you are buried out of sight. His affections were reached and he was willing to follow; he saw that every hope connected with Israel had really died with Christ.
H.C.A. Hence there was no way but to look to heaven.
F.E.R. The cedar wood, scarlet and hyssop were all cast into the burning. Man gets contaminated with the things of the world and death, and it is exceedingly difficult to go through the world without being contaminated with them, the water of purification comes in to cleanse a man. If a man were always up to his priestly functions, he would not want it, but we sometimes drop down to the level of common people by coming into contact with things in the world.
Paul immediately preached in the synagogue, Christ, that He is the Son of God. God Himself in that sense is the point of departure. He is no longer dealing with the responsible man, and trying to get anything out of man; the beginning now is God Himself, He is the source of everything for man.
T.H. "To reveal his Son in me", is the idea there that Paul was to be the vessel of that revelation?
F.E.R. I thought that was peculiarly Paul's testimony.
T.H. Does it convey the thought of the purpose of God -- sonship?
F.E.R. It seems to be the principle of what is set forth for man in Christ as Man.
T.H. He was not simply the vessel of revelation, but it is what is set forth in the Man. He announced as glad tidings, what was really God's mind for man.
J.S.O. It gives a wonderful character to christianity.
F.E.R. It involves a very vast extent of testimony when you consider what was set forth in Christ as Man,
{56}
He has fully set forth the mind of God. It was set forth in Christ as Man. It is not exactly revelation; the revelation of God is distinct from that though connected with it. The mind of God was set forth in the presence of the revelation of God.
J.S.O. The One who set forth God's mind is the One in whom He is revealed.
F.E.R. You get the two things in @Hebrews 1 and throughout John continually. Sonship comes out in Galatians as the mind of God for man.
T.H. The aspect of the church comes out here as the body of Christ.
F.E.R. I think it is Himself, Christ, in the saints. One thing is perfectly certain, that the body of Christ must take precedence over everything else. The body must come in before Israel, from the fact of its being the body and His body. This chapter is the unfolding of Christ down here, His activity and administration. It is not authority, but administration, and in connection with it His subduing power. Authority brings in judgment; administration brings in the Lord's subduing power. Saul is subdued, and Ananias, and at the end of the chapter you find whole cities turning to the Lord. The incident in the latter part of the chapter points to the time when Christ comes in, it is in that way more dispensational.
T.H. There is a special tenderness in the repetition of Saul's name.
F.E.R. In the case of Saul, religion connected itself with a tremendous strength of will which would not permit of any divergence from what was right and orthodox. The mind of man in the things of God may work tremendous mischief. Here the apostle of persecution becomes the apostle of the truth. It is administration coming in to subdue. In the samples given in this chapter there is no resistance. When the Lord sees fit to put forth His power nothing can stand against it.
D.L.H. If one had the sense of that it would give one
{57}
great quietness in regard to the testimony.
F.E.R. I think so. Though the Lord takes up nothing of earth -- no place in regard to the world -- there is great activity going on.
J.S.O. Results seem very small at present.
F.E.R. The results in this chapter are not very great; they are simply in one man until the close of the chapter. Saul was a chosen vessel, and he becomes an instrument in the hand of the Lord for the conversion of great numbers. It is accounted for in the present day by our being in the end of the dispensation. When you consider the state of the church, where is the 'Me' now? It is here but where can you distinguish it? There was no difficulty in distinguishing it then, but where is it today?
D.L.H. It cannot be found except morally.
F.E.R. It is obscure and hid in the mass of christendom, but we ourselves want to be in the 'Me'. The small results of the testimony at the present time are because brethren are not up to the mark.
E.R.B.R. Is not the 'Me' like the 7000 in Elijah's day in Israel?
F.E.R. They were quite hid; the Lord knew them. But it was not so with the 'Me' referred to here because it was known. The 7000 are hid today, but it is not God's mind that they should be hid. The difficulty of today is that we have not got the witness. The witness is here and it is essential to testimony, but it is very obscure. The living expression of Christ was here in the early days, and if it were here today the testimony would be entirely incontrovertible. By *testimony* I mean Christ in the saints; that is the only collective testimony. In the early part of the Acts, the first thing God did was to establish the witness, then you get the preaching going out; but there was no preaching until the witness was here. I quite admit the difficulty of the present time, but you have to hold to that principle.
J.S.O. There is nothing else to encourage one.
F.E.R. When there was a great work in regard to
{58}
brethren, it was in their early days because there was something of the witness there. If you take our meetings, many come to them just as they would go to church or chapel. They see things are a little more scriptural perhaps, but there is very little faith really. Take the prayer meeting, you do not find the men all praying and it indicates a lack of spiritual energy.
J.McK. One has proved that the condition of the local assembly has greatly affected the testimony.
F.E.R. That is the case. If you really want to have real power in the preaching, it would be when the meeting is right; that is the principle of the thing. When a meeting is right there is a real expression of Christ in the saints.
J.S.O. On the other hand, do you not think that at the end of a dispensation things are very low, and that the ministry of the Holy Spirit would be very much characteristic of the close?
F.E.R. It is at that point that God would come in and help the saints to awaken them to their calling. Any activity of the Spirit of God would begin from within and work outward.
W.B. When you speak of the saints you speak of a large company.
F.E.R. After all the Spirit of God has wrought among the saints, but very many of the saints have refused the activity of the Spirit. It has been very greatly refused in our day. Things are going very much to the bad in Protestantism because they have refused the light which God has brought in.
J.S.O. You get the principle of it in the Judges.
F.E.R. Yes, God has raised up men to awaken the saints afresh to their proper place and calling. As a matter of fact there cannot be a doubt that the present state of things in christendom is entirely apostate from the Holy Spirit, and what can God do but bring us back to what is really in the Holy Spirit?
W.B. It is a happy thing when a good many are led
{59}
to pray at the prayer meeting.
F.E.R. It is very striking to me the way the Lord deals with Ananias, he in a way resists the Lord when he gets his directions, but the Lord says to him "Go thy way"; I do not think you can resist the Lord.
J.S.O. He is like Peter, "I have never eaten anything common or unclean".
F.E.R. All must have sounded very strange to Ananias.
W.B. May there not be on the part of the unsaved the resisting of the Holy Spirit -- divine power?
F.E.R. There may be on the part of a christian. The will of man always resists the Holy Spirit; the flesh lusts against the Spirit, but there is a subduing power with the Lord which breaks down all opposition. With Ananias it was not will, it was hesitation. I think there is one principle which has to be accepted, namely, the sovereignty of the Lord. He is sovereign in the choice of instruments and vessels. I cannot tell who the Lord would use, because He does not act in accordance with my mind, He takes up very often very intellectual men. Paul is a special case and initiates the principle.
D.L.H. One sees what a deep work of God there was in him, he did neither eat nor drink for three days.
F.E.R. Every thought and feeling in Paul was completely revolutionised; it was a moral earthquake; all the foundations gave way and the whole edifice came toppling down about his ears. It reveals to us how far religious zeal leads a man.
D.L.H. It is tremendously opposed to God.
F.E.R. Yes, and nothing else would do for him but the subduing power of the Lord. What we have to meet today is the administration of the Lord and His subduing power.
T.H. In @2 Corinthians 10: 1 he speaks of the meekness and gentleness of the Christ, do you think that came out here?
F.E.R. I think so. Take the religious fanatic of today,
{60}
he does not appreciate the meekness and gentleness of Christ. When the Lord was here He said "Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am meek and lowly in heart". That is not at all appreciated in the world. They do not appreciate the qualities which are of God. The moment you get a divine Person become Man, He says "I am meek and lowly in heart". That is very strange because the world does not appreciate it, but what is highly esteemed among men is an abomination to God. There is a power in the Lord which is able to subdue all things to Himself, and if the Lord is to have sway, every sentiment appreciated in the world, patriotism, loyalty and the like, will have no place at all. No sentiment which had its origin in departure from God can have any place with God. God approves an entirely different line of sentiment to that.
J.McK. This is not a sample case of conversion.
F.E.R. I do not think so, though every man is subdued by the grace of the Lord. The Lord has come forth in divine goodness, not only to accomplish righteousness for God, but to establish salvation for man, and that breaks man down. The Lord has come in grace to deliver man out of the power of darkness, Satan and the world.
{61}
CHRIST AS HEAD
@Romans 4: 22 - 25; @Romans 5: 1 - 21
D.L.H. Does not the thought of Lord convey the idea of administration and authority?
F.E.R. I should think so. Even in the ministry of the Lord here on earth, the devils had to acknowledge that authority, and they came out. Power and authority were identified with Him. He brought the kingdom. There was power and authority in regard to all that was opposed to God. Man shared in the power and authority: they believed in Him as the Christ, not quite as Lord, and then the power and authority became available to them.
D.L.H. Is it that they got the good of it?
F.E.R. I think so, they cast out devils in His name; so far from being overcome by the power of evil, they overcame it in His name. In @Luke 10, the disciples came to the Lord and said that the devils were subject to them through His name. One essential difference between the "Head" and the "Lord" is this: righteousness is connected with the Head, and salvation with the Lord.
E.D. Would you explain in what way righteousness is connected with the Head?
F.E.R. It is essential to Christ being Head that he should have taken up all that lay upon man as under the judgment of God. If He is to be put in the position of Head of every man, I cannot see how He could be if He had not taken up all that lay upon man.
E.D. Is that the force of accomplished righteousness?
F.E.R. I think so, through one righteousness toward all men to justification of life. He took up man's liabilities that He might be the Head of every man.
W.B. How far would you say that went?
F.E.R. Everything that lay on man as under the judgment of God, Christ entered into.
Ques. Did these things come upon man consequent
{62}
upon the fall?
F.E.R. Yes, all men are under death. Christ entered into all the state of man, hence the reconciliation of the world in connection with it.
H.C.A. Christ having taken up everything is the basis of the gospel.
F.E.R. I think so, it is the only way by which He could be set in the position of Head of every man. The point in this chapter is the "one man".
W.B. When you say He took up all the liabilities of man you do not mean by that He bore all their sins?
F.E.R. No, I do not go quite so far as that, but in the name of that one Man, forgiveness of sins is announced to any man upon earth, not to every man; that is going very far. "Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem". He died for all, and entered into all that lay on man, on every man, in the eye of God.
E.D. Is that propitiation?
F.E.R. I think it is: He is the righteous One, and He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but for the whole world, says John in his epistle. Substitution carries with it the thought of election, but the headship of Christ is not a question of election but of the relation in which He stands to every man, and every man is responsible consequent upon His having been put in that position of Head of every man.
E.D. You can proclaim the gospel to every man on the ground of the headship of Christ.
D.L.H. Where does the Lord come in, because in the end of chapter 4, you get "Who was delivered for our offences".
F.E.R. Faith claims Him. There is the recognition that He is Lord, but that His rights are in abeyance. You claim him as Lord for salvation; that is the position of things now. The moment you recognise Him as raised
{63}
from the dead, He is Lord, and you claim Him, but His rights are in abeyance.
E.D. In @Romans 10, you get the Lord connected with salvation?
F.E.R. Yes, you confess Him with the mouth and that is salvation.
D.L.H. When it says "Who was delivered for our offences", would that be in the light of headship?
F.E.R. I should think so, it is in resurrection you get Him as Lord, "For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living".
W.B. Do you think that headship in @Romans 5, goes quite as far as "head of every man"?
F.E.R. I thought so. Adam was the figure of the One to come, he died out of headship, but I think he was the figure of the One to come. Christ has come in, and His headship is as wide as that of the first Adam.
E.D. Verse 18 shows that.
F.E.R. All through the passage the oneness is as wide in its bearing in regard of Christ as of Adam. The bearing of what Christ has brought in is towards all men.
F.C. Adam accomplished sin before he was head of a race, and the Second Man accomplished righteousness.
F.E.R. As a matter of fact; but in either case one or other must be the head. In our chapter Christ is head of the same race as Adam, that is the argument in this passage.
F.C. In what way is He Head to us?
F.E.R. The difference is not in the headship of Christ, it lies in that you live in the Head, and an unconverted man does not.
Ques. Do we not derive from the Head?
F.E.R. Yes, in living by Him. Every one who accepts Him as Head, lives by Him, because He is a life-giving Spirit. He communicates living water to the believer, and he lives by Him, and derives from Him.
E.D. And that brings in the body?
{64}
F.E.R. It brings in the body, but He is Head to the man in the street.
H.C.A. God has produced a new Head for the race.
F.E.R. It is the same race, the one man has died out of headship, but he was the figure of the One to come. Christ has come and accomplished righteousness, and the bearing of it is justification of life towards all men. Whatever Adam might have been, he is not head now, he is dead, and he has to stand on the footing of his own responsibility.
D.L.H. The Lord stands as Head somewhat differently from Adam in having taken up the liabilities; that idea could not come in in regard to Adam.
F.E.R. No, it is the contrast between sin and righteousness. Adam brought sin, Christ brought righteousness, and that being the case, men are responsible in regard of Christ as Head.
D.L.H. Would you say that everybody has a responsibility to Him as Lord?
F.E.R. I think not. @Philippians 2: 11 is when He asserts His lordship, then every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess that He is Lord.
D.L.H. It means that He is our Lord.
F.E.R. That is the thought there.
F.C. Would you not seek to reach the conscience of a person by pressing that on him?
F.E.R. No, unless he were a professed christian; I would not in regard to a heathen. A professed christian takes the place of owning Christ as Lord and does not do the things He says.
D.L.H. No one can say Lord to Jesus, but by the Holy Spirit.
F.E.R. The Holy Spirit gives the sense of His glory, then you confess Him as Lord by the Holy Spirit. Salvation is connected with Him as Lord, and involves deliverance from the power of evil, therefore the thought of lordship comes in.
Ques. How do you connect the thought of administration
{65}
with the Lord?
F.E.R. You get that in the Acts. He takes up Saul and Ananias for a special service in subduing power, but connected with the thought of Lord there is the thought of authority, power and judgment. All that comes in in connection with the Lord. You believe in Him as the Christ, and having believed, you claim and confess Him as Lord, and get the gain of it; practically it means salvation to us. The effect of it is that you have to say to nothing that does not come under His authority. I have no fellowship with what does not come under His authority.
D.L.H. You would apply the authority of the Lord to a person who said he was a christian?
F.E.R. I would. I am not called upon to judge a person's profession; if he takes the ground of being a christian he is responsible to own the Lord. Profession is christianity. No man gets salvation apart from the Lord.
D.L.H. That is important because it is a question of deliverance from opposing forces.
F.E.R. I see the disciples here on earth, instead of being overcome by the influences of evil, they overcame them, and they cast out devils. If we were to stand here in the power and authority of the Lord, we would overcome evil. Peter says you grow unto salvation, if so be that you have tasted that the Lord is gracious. He is a gracious Lord to us, but He has power and authority against evil. The thought of Lord brings in the kingdom.
D.L.H. Does the thought of Lord come in here in relation to the Lord's victory over death?
F.E.R. Practically. In this chapter you get salvation, power and authority connected with the Lord spiritually. It is all "our Lord" but the Lord's authority and power holds in abeyance the force and power of evil in order that you may get the good of all that is in the thought of God for you. Christ being Head is not simply on the ground of creation, because it involves that He is become
{66}
Man. God could not have been the Head of Christ until He became Man.
D.L.H. You get the order from God downwards. It is man and woman; it is not a question of christians, He is head of every man.
F.E.R. @Romans 5 is a wonderful chapter, and if we could understand the way the authority and power of the Lord are exercised we should have very much more comfort and stability. It is not in a public way, but there it is. This is the great chapter of salvation, you have peace with God, access by faith into the grace wherein we stand, you rejoice in the hope of the glory of God, and in tribulations, and you joy in God. At the close of the chapter it says "so also grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord". There are influences of evil here, but there is the power of the Lord who holds these powers of evil in control on behalf of christians, that they might be in the power of the good that is in the heart of God towards them.
Ques. Is this chapter the summing up of what Christ has elected?
F.E.R. Everything in the mind of the Jew, was connected with the law and covenant, but things are now put on a wider basis, on the ground of headship, which brings in every man.
D.L.H. Does faith come in with the recognition of His headship?
F.E.R. Yes, it is not exactly the Lord that is preached, it is Christ.
E.D. What is "we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus Lord"?
F.E.R. The apostle lays out the whole title, but the subject of the preaching was the Christ. Christ baptizes with the Holy Spirit and therefore He must stand in relation to every man. The Jew had a very limited idea about the Messiah, and the true thought in regard to Christ is that He is head of every man.
F.C. Is Christ Jesus, Lord, parenthetical?
{67}
F.E.R. It is descriptive; we preach Christ Jesus, Lord. The antichrist denies that He is the Christ, that He is head of every man. The unitarian will not object to Jesus but he objects to the Christ. It is to me the expression of infinite wisdom from God. Men were under death and judgment by the word of God, and how could God address man in that state? God brings in a Head who charges Himself with that which lay on man, and who is now set in the position of head of every man. God addresses every man in Christ, who is the wisdom and power of God.
D.L.H. God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself.
F.E.R. Exactly, not simply the Jew. A vast number of people have got a far too limited thought of Christ, He is the Christ, the anointed Man, who baptizes with the Holy Spirit. If the Holy Spirit abides on Him, He baptizes with the Holy Spirit.
Ques. Where does the responsibility of man come in?
F.E.R. To accept Him as head, because He is head.
W.B. Why do you not say Saviour?
F.E.R. Because scripture does not, and scripture is wiser than we are.
D.L.H. God is a Saviour God.
F.E.R. I do not object to Saviour, but at the same time I was thinking of the position in which God has set Christ in regard to men.
H.C.A. What about the Father sent the Son the Saviour of the world?
F.E.R. The point in John is that you learn that Christ is the Son of God, the last Adam is the Son of God. You get a wonderful passage in @John 17, "As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him". John is very interesting in that way, because he gives additional light to Paul and is confirmatory of him, that Christ is the Son of God.
Ques. Do you connect that authority with the Son of
{68}
God?
F.E.R. Yes, as the last Adam. It is a most wonderful thing to think that there is One in authority before whom all the powers of evil quake, and if we had the sense of that we would not be in the least afraid. You have to become conscious that in the Lord there is a mighty power and authority, greater than all the authority and power of evil; whatever the world or anything else may be, there is a power and authority superior to it.
D.L.H. You have to learn that for yourself.
F.E.R. And then you become strong in the Lord, and in the power of His might, and you take up the whole armour of God. But you must learn it for yourself. I really would like to see a christian who is really in the full gain of the head; conscious that He has got living water from the head, and in full confidence in the Lord on the one hand, while on the other, entirely independent of all that is down here upon earth. It is a very important point in the gospel to see clearly the point where you can fix responsibility upon every man.
Rem. If Christ is the head of every man, you can fix responsibility upon every man.
F.E.R. You cannot be effective in the gospel unless you can fix responsibility upon every man.
Ques. Is it in resurrection He becomes head of every man?
F.E.R. He could not take up that position until He was in resurrection, He had to bear what lay on all men first.
D.L.H. The force of His name, I suppose, brings that in?
F.E.R. It is the head. It is plain enough in @Luke 24, forgiveness of sins is preached in His name. It is plain in @Romans 10 that the lordship of Christ is connected with salvation.
Ques. What about "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved"?
{69}
F.E.R. The apostle was not putting the gospel to the Philippian jailor, he answered his question.
D.L.H. What was before the jailor's mind in saying that?
F.E.R. Oh, there was an earthquake, and he fully thought that every foundation was gone. The state of the man's mind was indescribable and he appealed to two men who were not in that state.
Ques. Does Paul set forth the head in @Acts 13: 38?
F.E.R. Yes, it is the Man Christ Jesus, the one Man of @Romans 5. The revelation of grace is in the one Man. Mediator is intimately connected with the Head, much more so than with the Lord.
D.L.H. As Mediator He brings in all the good of God to man.
F.E.R. The truth is this, that the Mediator is God.
E.D. He approaches man in the Mediator.
F.E.R. Yes, He approaches man in a Man. The wisdom of God raises up a head who is capable of bearing the liabilities of man, and also of imparting living water to him.
E.D. What is saved by His life?
F.E.R. Salvation at the present time is in the life of Christ. You grow up to salvation in the life of the head.
C. Do you get the head and lord typified in Joseph?
F.E.R. He was head to his brethren, but lord to the Egyptians, his lordship was universal.
C. He was saviour for the Egyptians, as well as for his brethren.
F.E.R. But you could not say he was head to them.
{70}
ADDRESS ON MARRIAGE
@Proverbs 31: 10 - 31; @1 Peter 3: 1 - 7
I think it is a mistake to suppose that marriage as it is now has reference simply to the interests of this present life. It is a relationship connected with this present life, I quite admit, but we take up marriage now, not from Adam and Eve, but from Christ and the church, and that brings into it very much more of the moral element; it places it, in that sense, in connection with what is above and beyond this present life. I think it is very important to have marriage in that connection.
Marriage is the crucial point in the history of a man for good, or for evil. It may work disastrously or otherwise; experience has shewn us that often enough, and we have to look to it that it may turn to good.
Now my object is to seek to shew how marriage may connect us with what is eternal. It may become an occasion in the grace of God, for those bound together in marriage, of forming special spiritual links, which are beyond all that is present. There may be a result of marriage which goes beyond all question of happiness, or of natural joy in the present life. I think it would be well indeed if the natural were sacrificed to the spiritual, if present gain were sacrificed to the spiritual and eternal; and if marriage be taken up in that light, I think we would gain great good from it.
Now you find Peter speaking to the husband and wife here as "heirs together of the grace of life". That could not have been said to Adam and Eve, but now another element has come in, and husband and wife are "heirs together of the grace of life". It is wonderful to look abroad in the world, and see the traces of the goodness of God still. You get something of that kind brought out in the passage I read in Proverbs. You could not fail to see traces of the goodness of God in existing relationships:
{71}
you see it in parents and children, and with husband and wife. While man on his part has become lawless, and turned to sin, yet you find certain traces of God's goodness remaining. I think that is perfectly evident, and as I said, you get a wonderful picture of it in Proverbs. All that was of the wife, and all her doings, and energies, were to be contributory to the husband. Mischief began by the woman losing the sense of the head; she got on on her own understanding, and lost the sense of the head, and that has never been recovered. Now the great point evidently in regard of marriage is that the wife must be prepared to sacrifice her own individuality, and her own interests, and all that, and her part is to be contributory to her husband. She must not seek to glorify herself; she has accepted a head -- for that is what is done in marriage, the man is the head of the woman -- and her energies and her doings are to be contributory to the man.
In the care of the household, and the bringing up of children and all that, she is to be the glory of the man. She was not to shine in her own glory, the woman is the glory of the man.
Now when you come to christianity, what I want to point out is this: we do not stand properly in relation to this world, but we stand in relation to the living God, and you cannot connect the living God with a scene which is dominated by death. That is a point of the last moment to my mind. God stands in relation to a scene of life. He is the "preserver of all men", I know, but the very idea of the living God is that He stands in relation to all that is life; and all that is of life stands in relation to a living God. If we accepted that, it would tend to separate us more in mind and spirit from the scene of death. We have to take up many things in connection with this scene of death, but at the same time, a man may be dissociated from the scene which is dominated by death, and we may all be conscious of being in relation with the living God. He has not yet come out publicly in that character, but when He comes out as the living God, the
{72}
whole scene will be filled with life -- it will be a wonderful day! Many of us have come to be fairly well content with this scene, when things are fair, but we have to remember that it is a scene dominated by death; no one can doubt for a moment that it is so. But if you have to do with the living God, He connects us with all that is of life, and all that is of life connects itself with the living God. The church is the church of the living God, and Christ is the living stone, and we, coming to Him as living stones, are built up a spiritual house. I believe it is a point of the last moment that God should give us some apprehension of the living God, and of all that stands in relation to the living God. In result all will take its character from the living God, He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for all live unto Him. Abraham and Isaac and Jacob all stand in relation to the living God and the church is the church of the living God. I want us to recognise that more and more. If people give themselves up to present proprieties and the amenities of life, they are acting to a very large extent in the light of a world that is dominated by death. People are to a great extent governed by it, you can see it by their appointments, their homes, and in their dress -- they make it manifest that they are more or less dominated by the scene which is under death. But what we want to make manifest in all that we are, and in the way too in which we carry out our natural relationships, is that we stand in relationship to the living God.
Now husband and wife are to walk together as heirs together of the grace of life. There was no question of their being heirs together at the outset, but it is a very important point now in regard to the marriage tie, and the practical result is that spiritual ties are formed, which are not for time but for eternity. It is not a question of mere natural happiness, or of what is agreeable to us in this life, but as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hindered. I am sure it is a most important point to see, placed together in such close
{73}
relationship as husband and wife, that there should be the formation of spiritual links which are connected with the living God. The relationship itself must of necessity come to an end with the life down here, but in regard to christians, God allows it to go on so that it might become the means of forming special and spiritual links which are for eternity. It is of all moment that our beloved brother and sister should take their light from Christ and the church. Christ loved the church, and gave Himself for it, and the church is subjected to Christ. So with the wife, she does not shine in her own light, but she is contributory to her husband, and the husband gives direction to his wife, he is head over her. I do not mean in the sense of lording it over her, but he brings in his influence in connection with all that is right, he directs her. And we who are husbands have to look to it that we lead our wives aright so that headship is seen.
Then the place of the wife is evidently that in the detail of life she is to be contributory to her husband. The great point is that the husband should go right, for then as a general rule you may say that if the husband goes right, then the wife will go right too. I believe if you trace it fairly you will find that the real reason why things have not gone right with many is that the husband did not go right. He is to take the initiative -- he is to direct his wife, and she on her part is to be subject to her husband, and if they carry that out they will walk together as heirs together of the grace of life, and will increasingly know what it is to stand in relation to the living God, and all that stands in relation to the living God is eternal. All that issues from the living God to us is what stands in relation to the living God, and which must therefore subsist eternally, because it has the blessed character of life in contrast to the death that dominates here in this scene of death. I would desire then that they might take their light from Christ and the church, and that they might stand in relation to the living God not merely in future relation, but in present relation to the living God, and
{74}
that their relation to one another as husband and we might be used to form those spiritual links which remain for ever.
{75}
THE WORD OF GOD
@1 Peter 1: 23 - 25
I want to say a little with regard to "the word of God". It is important to understand, the idea which is intended to be conveyed by it. Reference was made to the way in which, in @Luke 24, the Lord spoke to the two disciples. No doubt in that chapter the Lord, in a sense, took the place of the Spirit in expounding the Scriptures to His disciples. We must enter a little into the position they occupied, and indeed into that of all the Old Testament saints. What they had up to then, "the law and the testimony", was everything to them, but in @Luke 24 the point is, that while everything previously spoken was confirmed in Christ, it was He Himself who then spoke to them. He was the 'Yea and Amen' of all. And He was going to the Father to send to them the promise of the Father. Not merely was it that everything that God had purposed had its confirmation in Christ, but the power of all was to be down here in the Spirit.
That is the Spirit in which He blessed them, and "he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven". He went up to heaven to send on them the promise of the Father, and we have now, in contrast to what saints in previous times had, Christ, and every thought of God, everything spoken in anticipation, now established in Christ; the reality has come in, and, at the same time, the power of it down here in the Spirit. In every way you will find a correspondence in the Spirit to whatever has come out in Christ. The Spirit is spoken of as the Spirit of Christ, but also as the Spirit of God and even the Spirit of the Father. Everything is now witnessed and maintained here in the Holy Spirit. Christ went back to the Father that He might send from the Father the promise of the Spirit. That is what we get in @Luke 24. I call attention to the contrast between what had been,
{76}
what men rightly held to, and what marks this moment: Christ gone to the Father, every thought of God having its establishment and confirmation in Him, and He having sent down from the Father the promise of the Father, the Spirit.
To make things clear, I would notice a distinction between "the truth" and "the word of God". God's word is truth. Scripture says, "Thy word is truth". But there is, I think, a distinction between "the truth" and "the word of God". Scripture appears to make the distinction. "The truth" is the revelation of God. On the other hand, speaking in a general way, "the word of God" gives the idea of the revelation of God's thought and mind in regard to men. It may indeed go wider than man; but in general it is the expression of His mind with regard to man; and His word is ever truth characteristically. But at the same time there is "*the* truth", and that is a great thing to hold by. Christ is "*the* truth", and the Spirit is "the truth". These are statements made in Scripture, and entirely incontrovertible. It is remarkable that while the word of God is the expression of His thought and purpose with regard to man which comes out in a sovereign way, yet the revelation of God has come out in relation to man's state and necessities. If you go through Scripture I think you will find such to be the case.
The name 'Almighty' came out in connection with the weakness of Abraham. God had made far-reaching promises to Abraham in connection with himself and his seed, and yet Abraham was under the common liability of death. All these promises depended, as far as Abraham was concerned, on resurrection, and it is in that connection that God made Himself known as the Almighty God who quickens the dead. You have only to read @Romans 4 to see that "he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were". That was in connection with the fact that Abraham was under the power of
{77}
death.
The same principle is true with regard to Israel. In taking up Israel, God knew that He was taking up a people after the flesh, who, though they might be impressed by God's dealings for the moment, would be entirely incapable of remaining in faithfulness to God.
Everything precious entrusted to them they would certainly lose. That is met by the revelation of the name of Jehovah, which indicates the eternal faithfulness of God to His own engagements. That comes out in contrast to the weakness of the people who were sure to surrender all that God had given to them. The people soon forgot the promises, these lost power with them, they had the law, but the living promises of God were lost sight of; but after all God had revealed His name as Jehovah, and that secured the eventual blessing of the people, and their getting the promises in the sovereignty of God's mercy. You get that brought out in @Romans 11. In chapter 4 you get the Almighty, in chapter 11 Jehovah. Both names come out in connection with the weakness of man.
If I go further and speak of the name of Father under which God has now revealed Himself; what has been the occasion of that? Why the sending of the Son to be the Saviour of the world. "God is love", and "we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world", @1 John 4: 14. We have the revelation of the love of God; but the immediate occasion of that revelation is the condition of man as down here under liabilities in regard to God from which be cannot free himself. The case could only be met by God coming out in self-sacrificing love. "He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all", @Romans 8: 32. The condition of man becomes the occasion of God coming out in the full revelation of Himself in the Son. "In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. Herein is love,
{78}
not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins", @1 John 4: 9, 10. "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life," @John 3: 16.
In all that, as far as I understand it, you have the truth -- Christ is the truth -- and nothing comes up fully to the idea of the truth except the revelation of God. And I think you must distinguish between the revelation of God and the word of God, that is, the expression of His mind toward man, and yet the one depends on the other; the word of God takes its character from the revelation of God. You cannot understand the one apart from the other, though one may distinguish between them. All His thought and purpose in regard of man takes its character from the revelation of Himself. That is the point I want to make plain. Everything hangs together. His mind as to man hangs upon the revelation of Himself; on what He is, and the necessity of man has brought this to light. The more you look at it the more you see that the word of God wholly depends upon the revelation of God, but the revelation of God is the truth. It is a point of moment. Christ is the truth, and the Spirit is the truth. You could not say the Father is the truth, because He is not the expression. Christ is the truth as being the expression of God, and the Spirit subjectively in believers is the truth, perfectly answering to the revelation.
I come now to the word of God, and I look upon it as being the expression of God's mind and purpose in regard of man, and Christ is that. All the fulness of the Godhead dwells in Him, and at the same time Christ is the Word, the expression of God's mind in regard to man.
I venture to put it in this way: I should lay it down as a principle, that whatever has been expressed in Christ *as Man* is God's mind for man. I ask you to judge this. It is clear enough to my mind, and I would like to make
{79}
it clear to all. I am not now speaking of revelation. Of course everything which has been expressed in Christ as Man takes its character from that which Christ is. Nothing could be expressed in Christ which was contrary or unsuitable to Himself. Everything expressed in Him must take its character from that which He is.
I refer to three points: the first is righteousness -- it was the first thing that it was necessary for God to establish; the next is sonship; the third is eternal life. I take up these three things as having been expressed in Christ, and I want to shew you that they are the mind of God in regard of man down here. These thoughts come out in the Old Testament. They are not new. We shall see this if we go back to Abraham for a moment. What came out in him was righteousness; promises were given him, but the great point in regard to him was righteousness by faith. Abraham was accounted righteous. He stood in the account of God in righteous relation to Himself. You get the great principle of righteousness established. He is the father thus of all that believe.
In Israel we get another expression of the mind of God. God's word to Pharaoh was, "Israel is my son, my firstborn". "Let my son go, that he may serve me". @Exodus 4: 22, 23. You get here the idea of sonship, I admit, in regard of the nation; but anyway there is the idea of sonship and service. Sonship implies that there should be a point where the love of God could rest, so that He might be served. God could not be served where His love could not rest. The great idea was a point where love could rest. If divine love could not rest in you and me and we be conscious of it, we could not serve God. It is an impossibility that He could be served otherwise. You are familiar with the passage in Zephaniah: "He will rest in his love; he will exult over thee with singing" (@Zephaniah 3: 17) -- and that here upon earth.
Why are we so defective in ability for the service of God? I think it is because we have so little apprehension of sonship and divine love resting there. We have so little
{80}
apprehension of the calling.
I pass on to the third point -- eternal life. It is curious that the thought of eternal life comes out in David. Righteousness in Abraham, sonship in Israel, and David is the first to speak of eternal life. He speaks of it in @Psalm 21 and again in @Psalm 133, which is "A song of degrees. Of David". "There hath Jehovah commanded the blessing, life for evermore". These things were all in anticipation, for the reality could not come out then either with regard to Abraham, or Israel after the flesh, or David. David never came into eternal life down here, but it is evident that these things were the mind and thought of God in regard of man.
Now all has come out. The Son of God has come forth. He says, "Lo, I come ... I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart". @Psalm 40: 7, 8. The Son of God takes a path. The moment He takes a path as Man He is necessarily the righteous One. He was the righteous Jehovah, the righteous God, but the moment He becomes Man, He takes a path He never did before. God prescribes a path; man takes a path, and Christ becomes Man and He takes a path to fulfil all righteousness. He undertakes the responsibilities under which man lay that we might stand in relation to Him as the Sun of righteousness, like the moon to the earth or the earth to the sun. That is the relation in which we stand to Christ. Sonship is evident and everything takes it character from what Christ is Himself. He is Son. And eternal life has been manifested in Him. In Christ down here upon earth there was an energy of life which rendered impotent the power of death and the forces of evil, and that is what eternal life means in its principle.
Every thought of God in regard to man has its full and perfect expression in Christ. He is the truth, the revelation of God, but He is also the Word, that is, the expression of God's mind in regard to man, and the one hangs upon the other. There could be no thought in
{81}
regard of man except what depended upon the truth, what is consistent with it and taking its character from it. When we come into the apprehension of God's mind we find that we are in the full and blessed light of the revelation of God. All our blessing -- every element of it, brings us into the full light of the love of God. He has brought us out of darkness into His marvellous light. We walk in the light as God is in the light. God has shone out and our blessing is in the presence of the glory of God.
We have righteousness, we have sonship, and God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.
One word more. We have come into the full light of God's thought in regard of man, and Israel too will come into it. Even the nations will participate in righteousness and in a certain way in eternal life.
I hold it to be an incontrovertible principle that what has been set forth in Christ as Man is God's mind for man. It is a great thing to get hold of a principle that can be carried through. We have now been brought into the light of God's word and it is Christ, and we have the answer to Christ in us. Christ was bent upon gathering those to whom He could impart His Spirit. From the outset you see this. He gives living water springing up in the recipient to eternal life -- that is in divine, quickening power in affection, so to fill us that the believer rises up to the full light of Christ, and in getting into the full light of Christ we come into the full light of God's mind with regard to man. It is not God's thought about any particular people, but about man; every man may have it, but through grace we have been brought into it, and we get it made efficient in us by the Spirit. We come into righteousness efficiently by the Spirit of God. I quite admit a man is justified by faith, but we come into righteous relation to God and to Christ *by the Spirit*. The Spirit is the seal of righteousness. The new man is created after God in righteousness and true holiness. You may apprehend that God can justify the ungodly,
{82}
but I do not think you can come efficiently into righteousness but by the Spirit. The Spirit is life, too, in regard of righteousness.
I need hardly say it is in the same way we come practically into sonship. The Spirit so makes us acquainted with the love of God in Christ that we come into the sense of it. The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Spirit. The Spirit in us cries, Abba, Father.
And so, as regards eternal life. It is a question of proximity to Christ. If you get close to Christ you come into eternal life. "God has given to us eternal life; and this life is in his Son". It seems a simple question of being brought by the Spirit into proximity to the Son. We get under the influence of that which marks the Son. "He is the true God and eternal life". @1 John 5: 11, 20. Thus Christ is the Word of God, the perfect expression of His mind in regard of man. All is in connection with the light of which we have heard this morning. The immediate occasion of the revelation of God has been the weakness of man through sin. If that be the case, do not you think that man might trust God? It is not my strength or my suitability which has brought out the revelation of God, but my helpless condition -- and God in Christ has taken occasion to make known His thoughts in regard to man. His communications are livingly expressed to us in the Son of His love. It is not in terms but in a Person. Righteousness, sonship and eternal life we apprehend in a Person, and not only so, but that Person is represented in us by the Spirit. "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death".
I had a good deal of diffidence in attempting to speak at this time, but I feel it is important to make clear what the word of God is in its moral sense, and how it is substantiated in the people of God by the Spirit of God.
{83}
THE HEAVENLY CITY
@Revelation 21: 1 - 27
Ques. Are the two chief thoughts in connection with the city light and government?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
Ques. Is there any connection between the two?
F.E.R. I think the light of the city becomes really the glory of the kingdom.
Ques. Is there any difference between the heavenly city in the kingdom and in the eternal state?
F.E.R. You will find a number of details in regard to the city in the latter part of the chapter which you do not find in the city in the former part. There is no allusion to the throne or to government in connection with the eternal state. In verse 8 the narrative is brought up to the end, and then some details of the city in the millennial age are added.
Ques. Does the heavenly city come out twice?
Rem. It descends out of heaven from God; that is characteristic.
Ques. But is there such a thing as a city in the eternal state?
Rem. No; what is connected with the eternal state is the tabernacle.
Ques. What is the difference?
Rem. The tabernacle is more the dwelling where God manifests Himself. The tabernacle of God is with men. The city is for administration and rule.
Ques. Is this the city that Abraham looked for?
Rem. I believe he will find what he looked for in this city.
Rem. The communications he had from God must have led him to the world to come in his expectations.
Ques. Do you think this 'looking' was the comment of the Spirit on what his expectation was?
{84}
Rem. The point was that he would not have anything which was not *of God*. He had been called out of all that was of men; he would not have any of the cities of Canaan, but only one whose builder and maker was God. The light may have been dim, but he had that thought, and it is an immense thing that *we* have what is of God.
Ques. I suppose the heavenly Jerusalem would be necessary to the earthly city, for what is alluded to in the Psalms could not be carried out without?
F.E.R. I think so. You do not get the introduction of a city on the part of God till it has come in on the part of man. You first get Babel, and then Abraham sought a city; so, too, at the end you get the angel first shewing to the apostle Babylon, the idolatrous city, and after the destruction of the idolatrous city the holy city comes into view. The first city was for the glory of man, and was to carry the name of man. In the heavenly city, God has a *name*, as the earthy Jerusalem is the city of the great King, so the heavenly city is the city of the living God.
Ques. I thought it was the revelation of the name of God that led Abraham to look for a city?
F.E.R. Yes, and that revelation was made to him when he was separated from man. Man looks for a certain kind of stability, and a name in connection with it. The idea of a city is connected with imperialism. Nebuchadnezzar says, for instance: "Is not this great Babylon, that I have built ... for the honour of my majesty?" @Daniel 4: 30.
Rem. In Germany they are trying to improve Berlin to make it worthy of an empire.
F.E.R. So, too, in England. London is the great imperial centre. People are not now content with a kingdom.
Ques. What is the idea of a country?
F.E.R. Extent or expanse.
Ques. Is the heavenly city the church only?
F.E.R. I thought so, because it is the bride.
{85}
Ques. Why then are the names of the twelve tribes in the gates?
Rem. Because everything gets its character from the church. Israel's position by and by as the centre of God's government on earth hangs on the church being the vessel of heavenly rule. They have nothing until the co-heirs are in glory with Christ. The church is, so to speak, that which fills up everything which God has brought in. The heavenly city is the crown and keystone of all God's ways. You could not get the fulfilment of the promises to Israel unless the church was in glory. It is from the heavenly Jerusalem that the water of life flows out, and in it are the leaves of the tree for healing. All the hopes of Israel are held in the church in the present interval. You would not get government in grace apart from the heavenly city.
F.E.R. It is a great point that at the present time the hope of Israel is maintained in the church. The church has that place when apparently all is gone for Israel. Israel has given up its own hope and place, and it is maintained in the church.
Ques. How?
F.E.R. The first-fruits of Israel were gathered into the church. That remnant was the beginning of it. They did not give up the hope of Israel, and it is still maintained in the church.
Rem. Paul said he was standing for the hope of Israel.
F.E.R. And so are we. We do not get, or claim, the elder brother's portion. England has, in a sense, taken up the place of Israel in regarding herself as nationally a special object to God. We have to be content with the church's portion, and we can then stand for those who, for the time, have lost their hope. God does not allow anything of His to be lost. He maintains the truth of Israel in the church. The great mistake is connecting the idea of nationality with christianity. The church has no part on earth. It is of the elder brother that it is said,
{86}
"All that I have is thine".
Ques. Is it maintained in our having the cup of the new covenant?
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. Does all distinction cease in the eternal state?
F.E.R. Yes. The prominent idea there is the tabernacle of God, and it is with *men*, not with a nation. That goes back to God's original intention, *God and man together*. There will be no more sea, no more division of men into nations.
Rem. Heaven and earth will touch very closely; they communicate with each other in the eternal state.
Ques. What are the principal features of the city?
F.E.R. You get glory, light, walls, gates. And these are things that ought to characterise us now, for where the church has failed we never get its witness restored, and faith goes on to what is to come; there is no good in looking back, but if you go on to the future you return to original principles and get power to hold what God set up at the outset; you are effective in the present, for you seek to maintain in the present what will come out in the future. In principle there can be no difference between what will come out in the heavenly city and what marked the church at the outset as witness. You get the glory mentioned before you get the light, and the light before the other details which are characteristic.
Ques. What is the thought connected with the glory of God?
F.E.R. You get it in @2 Corinthians 4. "God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ". It is the effulgence of God shining out in all that God is, in His own moral lustre and perfection; not merely the revelation of God. It includes the fulfilment of prophecy. It is like what you get in @Hebrews 1, of the Son. It says, "Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of
{87}
his power".
Ques. What is "Her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal"?
F.E.R. "Her shining" would be a better word, it is her reflection. It is a moral idea; when God comes out He sets aside all the glory of man and brings out His own glory. It is no longer God acting under a veil of providence, He comes out as to all that He is.
Ques. What is "her shining"?
F.E.R. The glory of God lightens it, for the shining of it forth. A precious stone only *reflects* light, it has none in itself. Put it in a dark place, and you see no shining. It is the same word as in Philippians, "Among whom ye shine as lights in the world".
Ques. Will the shining of the city be expressive of God?
F.E.R. Yes, that is what it is, it is reflected light.
Ques. Is that the glory of the Father?
F.E.R. It is more the thought of *God*, the glory of God. Each Person of the Godhead has His own glory. It is a great thing to "rejoice in hope of the glory of God", and what follows on that is, that all before Him must be *according* to His glory. We can rejoice in hope of the glory of God, but we are not prepared for it save as we are according to it. There is a great deal in us which is not according to that glory, and so we come under discipline, and the fact that we come under discipline proves that we are not according to God's glory; when we are, there will not be any more discipline. When the heavenly city comes out, all in it is according to God Himself. Adam in Eden was not unsuitable to the glory of God, but he was hardly according to it. I anticipate the glory now though I am not yet according to it, and if I did not cherish the expectation of it I could not rejoice in it. The knowledge that we shall be according to the glory of God enables us to rejoice in the hope of it. "It doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall
{88}
see him as he is". It is certain that if God displays His glory what is before Him must be according to it. We have the love of God shed abroad in our hearts, which is the source of all, and God is working now that we may be morally according to His glory. Israel will be lightened by the glory of God, so too the nations, but the church is that which alone *has* the glory of God, because it alone is completely suitable to it.
Ques. "Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages". Is that because all in her is suitable to it?
F.E.R. Yes. That is what is seen in the city.
Rem. In Old Testament times the glory was concealed behind the veil, no one could walk in the light of it, and the priests were driven out, for things were not according to that glory.
Rem. All that is to be known of God by and by will be known through the church.
Ques. Is that the fulness of Him that filleth all in all? @Ephesians 1: 23.
F.E.R. That is connected with Christ and the bride idea. "Gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all". Afterwards we see the church filled unto all the fulness of *God*. The point is to be in the light of the city *now*; God is going to display His glory and the church will be according to it, and we ought to be deeply exercised to be according to it *now*. There is no use in speaking of rejoicing in hope of the glory of God if we are not exercised as to being according to it now, which means having the light of the heavenly city before us. We wait the appearing of that glory. (See @Titus 2: 12, 13.) "We should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ". Man's glory -- everything of man is really childish in a moral point of view. When you take a moral survey of things, all here -- all that is connected with the
{89}
glory of man seems very poor.
Ques. How will the glory be manifested by and by?
Rem. It is really the church which forms the wealth of God's glory. It is wonderful to think of that when God speaks of "the riches of his glory". @Romans 9: 23.
Ques. What are the walls of the city?
F.E.R. The idea in them is that of exclusion, it does not mean security; the city is exclusive by the very nature of it; all worldliness, all impurity, all that is contrary to God is excluded by the very nature of what the city is. If you want holiness that is how you get it. Holiness is to be promoted because of the fact that we are to be "holy and without blame before him in love". And again, "You, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and un-blameable and unreproveable in his sight". @Colossians 1: 21, 22. We want the walls great and high to be before God holy and un-blameable.
Ques. How is that promoted now?
F.E.R. By the knowledge of God's holy love. No other way is possible. Love is exclusive *because* it is holy.
Rem. The walls are *part of the city*, not encircling it, and in the very nature of things it excludes all that is not of God.
F.E.R. People are slow to get hold of great divine ideas, what they do is to take up texts of scripture and sentiments.
Ques. Do not you think that the glory disperses all that is contrary to it?
F.E.R. Well, I should not like to be dispersed then, I should rather the dispersion took place now.
Ques. How is what is contrary dispersed?
F.E.R. By discipline. God disciplines us now to remove what is not according to His glory. There will not be discipline then. Discipline is the expression of perfect love. No one would desire to be without it, because so conscious of needing it.
{90}
Ques. Is it in view of light?
F.E.R. It is to make room for it. It is *children* whom God chastens, there is no chastening for sons. The distinction between children and sons is extremely nice, one merges into the other, but there *is* a shade of distinction. We are children now and in the light of sonship. Sonship is connected with the divine purpose. In the sanctuary you are come to the place of sonship. Children come under the discipline of God, and God does not pass over anything in His children, and no right-minded child would want to escape discipline. It is that we should be "partakers of his holiness".
Ques. In @Hebrews 12 it asks, "what *son* is he whom the father chasteneth not?"
F.E.R. That is a quotation from the Old Testament. "Let my son go, that he may *serve* me" is the idea of a son -- "that he may *serve* me".
Ques. Is this cry for imperialism a sign of the times?
F.E.R. It cannot come out fully until the church is gone. God started with the rule of the heavens, and nothing will be right here until the rule of heaven comes in morally. Then everything will be set right on earth. You will not have one bit of the glory of man there. The appearing of the glory of God will wither up all the glory of man.
Rem. With regard to the new Jerusalem J.N.D. has said that it is remarkable that you do not see any one. You see the city and the glory of God. Though the names of the twelve apostles are there, not one of the names is given. So we are told that the names of the twelve tribes were on the breastplate of the high priest, but we are not told their names.
F.E.R. The fact is, all is so perfectly balanced of God, there can be no room for human prominence.
Ques. How does the promise to the Philadelphian overcomer come in here? @Revelation 3: 12.
F.E.R. It is remarkable that in the last three churches Christ presents Himself in characteristics which are
{91}
either moral or are connected with the kingdom, and carry you on to the kingdom. In Thyatira you come to the end of the church, and from that point onward Christ presents Himself in other lights. In the promise to the overcomer in Philadelphia we get, "will I make a pillar in the temple of my God ... and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God". The church has failed, and therefore there is the looking forward to the kingdom. What enables any one to maintain now is seeing God's idea. One wants to be characterised by "the city of my God" *now*.
Ques. Why is there no temple in the city?
F.E.R. There is nothing to enshrine because God is everything. One part is as holy as another. It is wonderful that we shall be able to bear God's glory, and shall be in the presence of that glory with exceeding joy. We ought to be under its power now, and nothing less than that satisfies the new man.
Ques. What is the force of the expression, when the kingdom is delivered up, "that God may be all in all"? @1 Corinthians 15: 28.
Rem. When everything is subdued God morally will fill all. He will fill His own creation.
Ques. Is that the idea in "the tabernacle of God is with men"?
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. What is the force of God being all in all -- is it power?
F.E.R. It is nature, life, and that is *love*. *God* is all in all. Father, Son and Holy Spirit. The Son is subject, the Spirit is pervading, as Mr. Darby says, 'By the Spirit all pervading'.
Ques. What is the force of the kings of the earth bringing their glory to it?
F.E.R. I think they recognise the church in its own proper place in relation to God and the Lamb. It is in
{92}
that way that God connects Himself mediately with the world to come, and the church has that place as the vessel of the glory.
Ques. Do the nations derive their glory from it?
F.E.R. I do not know; you cannot separate the church from Christ. "If we suffer, we shall also reign with him". But the Lamb's wife shares all that belongs to the Bridegroom, and that brings in an important point -- that as the bride we ought to be faithful to the Bridegroom, and properly to lose our own interests in those of the Bridegroom. The "husband is known in the gates" in that day, and He should be known there now. Union is with the exalted Man, association is with the Son of God.
Ques. Is union future?
F.E.R. Not altogether. "The Spirit and the bride say, Come" now. The sanctuary brings in the thought of association with Christ, and is in one sense a greater thing than union. @Ephesians 1 is association -- sonship. (See verse 5.) In association you are with Him as the Son of God. You never can be *united* to the Son of God as such. Union is with the exalted Man. Mr. Stoney brought that out: I did not see the force of it at the time. Sonship brings you into association with the Son of God.
Rem. Then association must be something higher that what we get here.
F.E.R. Yes; Mr. Darby pointed out that to be placed in association with Christ is greater than what you get here -- greater than to be the bride, the Lamb's wife, though there could not be association without union. In the bride idea you are united to Christ, but in sonship you are with Him as His companions in the presence of the Father.
{93}
ETERNAL LIFE
@John 7: 37 - 39
W.R. I think you said on a previous occasion that "eternal life" is a sphere of blessing -- 'it is not a possession and belongs properly to the world to come'. I made that remark to someone, and he politely said that he did not believe it. Will you please make it clear to me?
F.E.R. If you trace it through Scripture, to begin with, the first allusion to it is in @Psalm 21, "He asked life of thee and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever".
Then I think the next thought connected with it is in @Psalm 133, "There the Lord commanded the blessing (which, I take it, refers to Zion) even life for evermore". The next allusion to it is in the last chapter of Daniel (verse 2): "And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt". It is perfectly evident that all these passages have to do with the earth and that they undoubtedly refer to the millennium: The difference between @Psalm 133, and the last chapter of Daniel is this: in the former I take it that eternal life is connected with the Jew, and the last chapter of Daniel carries the thought out to Israel.
I think the point to which I should next refer is @Matthew 25, the last verse: "And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal". The importance of that passage is that it carries the thought out to the gentiles; you get the Jew in @Psalm 133, Israel in the last chapter of Daniel and the gentiles in @Matthew 25 -- eternal life having its application to all. The question was raised with the Lord: He speaks of eternal life and says "In the *coming age* eternal life".
These passages make it perfectly clear that eternal
{94}
life is in the coming age -- the millennium. The coming of Christ brings it in, that is, for the world to come, but we get it in anticipation now, as risen together with Christ -- we come into what is properly characteristic of the age to come. You may speak of many other things which we anticipate in the same way -- things which properly belong to the world to come, but we anticipate them. We are risen together with Christ now, we have not to wait for the millennium; and thus we come into eternal life now. That is the way I understand it. With the Jew the thought is always connected with eternal life on earth.
Rem. Eternal life was usually looked upon as the portion of the christian which he took possession of as soon as he believed.
F.E.R. That I cannot understand, for the Lord says, "Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life", and the Spirit is "a well of water springing up into everlasting life"; "grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life". It is a point to be reached in the soul, "He that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting".
Ques. How do you understand @John 17: 3?
F.E.R. That shows the character of what it is; christians according to the mind of God are risen together with Christ, brought into association with Him on the ground of resurrection, and their privilege is to "know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent". That is how we come into the good of it now -- brought into sonship, into association with Christ as a priestly company, and it is in that way we come into eternal life. A kind of conventional teaching may spring up amongst us which really comes to be very often astray from the truth. Many of these things were meant right enough at the outset, but they have got fixed and stereotyped, and have come to be conventional, and the moment they get into that shape, the moulds are too rigid to hold the truth, and the truth breaks them. You must get rid
{95}
of the mould in order to keep the truth very often. It may serve very well and be useful for the moment in order to present the doctrine and that kind of thing, but sooner or later you find the moulds are too rigid to hold the truth and you get rid of the mould and get hold of the truth.
Rem. I suppose these passages do not militate against @John 3: 16 and @John 5: 24?
F.E.R. Not at all. We come into things by anticipation -- things which properly belong to the world to come.
Ques. "He that ... believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life". It is true now?
F.E.R. That is the kind of person that has it.
Ques. How is eternal life obtained?
F.E.R. By the Spirit: "He that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting".
Ques. When is one prepared for it?
F.E.R. When the Spirit springs up, and they are prepared to let everything in the way go. It springs up into everlasting life.
Ques. Is a man specially conscious of reaching this stage?
F.E.R. Yes. The first thing is, he comes into the fellowship of Christ's death, and it is in that way he gets to the other side of Jordan, into the land of promise, where Christ is. You cannot bring Christ into the wilderness -- and a great part of our christian experience has to do with the wilderness.
Ques. What is the difference between "Life forevermore" in @Psalm 133 and eternal life which is our portion?
F.E.R. There is none. The general idea is the same, only we get it in a different shape, from what they do. They will get it in connection with the presence of Christ here and temporal blessing. That is the meaning of the words "There the Lord commanded the blessing" -- God ordained it. I think you get an allusion to it in
{96}
@John 12: 50, "I know that his commandment is life eternal". He ordained the blessing, appointed it. Any appointment of God is His commandment.
Ques. I suppose it is in John the links are broken?
F.E.R. Yes, I wonder how many people are prepared to let all go, to reach Christ. Take what is going on at the present time: it only proves to me that they mind earthly things -- I know it in myself -- the Englishman asserts itself a bit. The apostle wept over people minding earthly things. Our citizenship is in heaven. Many people do it thoughtlessly, it is not exactly purpose that they pay attention to things here unheavenly. But the apostle was very strong about it -- "Of whom I have told you often, and now I tell you even weeping", and one great point was, "they mind earthly things". In contrast to that he says, "our commonwealth has its existence in the heavens".
Earthly things are the political things which are going on on earth, and when I see saints pretty much occupied with newspapers and having a keen interest in things which are going on in the world -- which need not affect them one bit -- I say, they mind earthly things.
These verses (@John 7: 37 - 39) complete the teaching of chapters 5, 6, and 7. I spoke of these chapters as being the evidence of christianity: chapter 5 presenting the Father and the work; chapter 6 brings in the Son of man and the ministry of bread, and chapter 7 the living water flowing out of the believer, which brings in the Holy Spirit. All these go out of the church at the present time: men that were dead are made to live -- that brings the Father in; there is the ministry of bread for believers, and there is the water flowing out of the belly of the believer. So you have evidence of the Father, of the Son of man and of the Spirit down here.
Rem. We have usually looked at the living water flowing out of the believer as the gospel.
F.E.R. I think it is too limited altogether. Properly speaking living water will flow out of Jerusalem, i.e.
{97}
health-giving influences. And it is the same with the believer: all that flows out of him is really helpful and ministers life, it has that character by the Spirit, and it is for the benefit of men. What will flow out of Jerusalem when it is established will be for the benefit of the whole earth. So it is now, that out of the belly of the believer shall flow rivers of living water, there is an overflow.
Ques. In that way I suppose the need of souls is met?
F.E.R. Yes, my feeling about it is that in every circle in which I am placed, all the influence which goes from me should be healthful and savour of life.
Ques. It is individual then?
F.E.R. Yes, I think you come to what is collective in chapters 9 and 10. I feel condemned for myself very much in the face of this scripture: like a kind of well or pump, the water is there but does not come to the surface.
Rem. This supposes a good previous history, because what flows out of the belly is what the man is.
F.E.R. It is what the man enjoys. It is all connected with Jesus glorified. The point is that in going to heaven Christ has carried every divine interest for the earth up with Him. It is a great comfort to me to think that God has plenty of interests here on the earth and that they are secured in Christ in heaven, and we are in the secret of it.
Ques. This carries a good deal more in it than being able to give helpful answers, when questions are put to us?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. It means that you are able to give something helpful apart from that.
Ques. Do you connect @2 Timothy 2: 21 with this? "If therefore one shall have purified himself from these".
F.E.R. That is preparatory. I think the thought in @John 7 goes beyond that. The Lord is speaking more of what is normal in @John 7 and does not contemplate all the evil in christianity that you have to purge yourself
{98}
from -- "This spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive".
It is a great point with me that the earth has no future in politics.
Ques. Do you mean that it will all be stopped?
F.E.R. It may be stopped at any moment. Then again no politician can tell what is going to take place. It is a remarkable thing, but William Pitt, who was a pretty cute politician, on the verge of the country going to war, said, 'There never was a moment when the state of Europe so guaranteed the continuance of peace'. And within 12 months the country had to enter upon a war which lasted some 15 years. That shows you what politics are.
Ques. Is there any reason why one should take no interest in it?
F.E.R. All I say is this -- there is no future for the world in politics. It is the power of affection that carries our hearts out of earthly things. I like people to take an interest in the earth in right things, but the great point is, there is no future for the earth *in politics*. There is a future for the earth, and the future lies in the promises of God, which centre in a Man, who is at the right hand of God. The world has turned that Man out, so that we could not rightly have any interest in politics. It is of the deepest interest to me that Christ has carried to heaven every divine interest down here.
Ques. Will they come back again?
F.E.R. Yes, all will come out in Christ and we shall reign with Him.
Ques. So you would encourage the study of prophecy?
F.E.R. As to the general idea of it, yes; I like to go through Scripture to get every purpose of God. You get all the interests of God down here, but Christ has been here and has carried every interest up to heaven -- therefore, every interest of mine is in heaven. The effect of that down here on the earth is that out of my belly
{99}
flows "living water". As regards the promises and prophecies of God connected with the Jew, the Jew does not cherish them. He has turned to money-making and what not, but the church is holding the ground of the Jew.
Ques. The history of the Jew is completed for this moment, is it not?
F.E.R. Yes, but there are many things belonging to them -- there is a portion for the Jew, but that portion is cherished in the church, because the church is in the light of Christ. The church knows that their portion hereafter is secured, and cherishes it; and that accounts for the names of the twelve tribes being inscribed on the gates of the heavenly city.
Ques. When you say that Christ has carried every interest into heaven, is there no interest for Him down here?
F.E.R. There is no interest in connection with the earth now; there is the church and that is heavenly.
It is of profound delight to me to think that every purpose and promise of God is secured to God's glory in Christ; that is, in the Man that is in heaven. There is another point connected with it, and that is, the church is united to that Man, so that the church will participate in His glory. By the very fact of the Spirit being here there is a restraint on lawlessness. So long as the Spirit of God is here you will undoubtedly find a certain respect maintained for the authority of God.
Ques. And would that not be the Spirit working with the world?
F.E.R. No. It is consequent upon the Spirit being in christians.
Ques. The restraint is increased or decreased according to the number of christians?
F.E.R. Exactly!
Ques. Will you tell me what that scripture means -- "My spirit shall not always strive with man".
F.E.R. God was going on with a testimony of
{100}
righteousness, and that was in view of the flood, I take it.
Ques. And do you not get the long-suffering of God today?
F.E.R. I do not think God is dealing with men on that ground. All that kind of thing came to an end in the death of Christ What God does now is to present the idea of 'Head'. He presents to men the testimony of Christ, but does not strive with man. I think the whole state of things was entirely altered after the death of Christ.
Ques. "Ye do always resist the Holy Spirit", would that refer to the gentiles as well as the Jews?
F.E.R. It would not have quite the same application. The fact is this, that the gentile has to a certain extent accepted the testimony of God, which the Jew resisted.
What God said was that the word would be preached to the gentiles and they would hear it.
Ques. Does not the Spirit of God reprove the world?
F.E.R. He did when He came, by the fact of His being here. He convicts the world of sin, because they believe not on Him. Christ is the test, the Spirit was not the test.
Ques. What does the Spirit come for really?
F.E.R. To conduct a company to Christ and all the other is incidental to that.
Ques. Is that not made good in the assembly?
F.E.R. Yes. The Spirit does not bring us to heaven, Christ brings us to heaven, but the object of the Spirit is to conduct us to Christ now.
Ques. What did you mean just now, when you said that Christ does not come to us in the wilderness?
F.E.R. We must get to Him, where He is, that is the meaning of the passage in Colossians, "Christ in you the hope of glory". I think that is all the other side, it is the mystery connected with the body.
Ques. Does chapter 6 correspond to the Jordan more?
{101}
F.E.R. No, chapter 6 is on the way, and is connected with the wilderness; it would not run with Colossians and Ephesians. In chapter 6 the great point is the "Son of man" and the evidence of the Son of man is that there is the ministration of bread down here. Verse 53 is the appropriation of His death. It is not the way of life, it is through the life.
Ques. The words "Ye have no life in you" would hardly be true of one of God's children, would they?
F.E.R. No. It is death come in as a test, and if they do not eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood, it is a proof they have no life in them. What I understand by it is this: it is the soul's appreciation of the grace which comes to us in the death of Christ and it continues. The fact of it all is, that there is bread for the believer, and you cannot prevent believers having the bread. I believe there are two things in which you find bread, you find it in His death, and you have it in His priesthood. With regard to the latter, we are at the throne of grace, and obtain mercy and find grace to help in times of need.
Rem. I think somebody was saying just now that eating the flesh of the Son of man and drinking His blood is habitual?
F.E.R. Yes. You never get out of the sense, and should not, of the grace which has been expressed in the death of Christ. I want to have my soul kept in that as long as I am down here. Another thing comes in, and that is, that the One who died is really living at the right hand of God. The practical result is that we can go boldly to the throne of grace to obtain mercy and find grace to help.
Ques. Will you give us a few practical hints as to how verse 38 of chapter 7 can be true of us?
F.E.R. I do not know, except that it can only come to pass through the soul taking up and entering into every interest of God which belongs to the earth, and seeing that all is secured in Christ in glory. My citizenship
{102}
is in heaven -- that is the idea of it to me. It is all centred in Christ. Believing on Christ in John's gospel means believing on Christ to the exclusion of everything else. I have faith in Christ and have faith in nobody else, so that you turn to Christ before friends. They may be good enough, but I have faith in nobody but Christ.
Ques. Was there anything in the Lord saying this at the feast?
F.E.R. Yes. Chapters 6 and 7 cover the entire ground of the feast. Chapter 6 is the passover, chapter 7 is the feast of tabernacles; and He shows that what would come in connection with Himself would entirely surpass the feasts. You get the flesh and blood of the Son of man in chapter 6 in contrast to the passover. In chapter 7 what the Spirit would do in connection with the glorified Christ surpasses the feast of tabernacles.
The two chapters cover the entire ground of the feasts. The feasts began with the passover and ended with the feast of tabernacles. What answers to the feast of tabernacles is the fact that Jesus is glorified. It is not that you have all the interests of God brought to pass upon the earth, but you have them secured in Christ in heaven. So that if we had a sense of what God was in Christ, we should not want anything. "Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water". It is not a point of what He has for us, but what He has for God. It is glory to God by us.
Ques. Is that the object of priesthood -- that we might be brought into these things?
F.E.R. Well, I think that the object of priesthood is that you may never lose the sense of grace.
Ques. These truths that you have been bringing before us should not make the christian idle?
F.E.R. I think we should benefit those we come in contact with very much more, because out of my belly should flow living waters. It ought to be an exercise to everybody that he should be in this world beneficially, he ought not to stagnate. There is something for everyone to do -- a man may show mercy with cheerfulness.
{103}
Ques. Is it the same as being the salt of the earth?
F.E.R. Yes, quite so. It is a very great comfort to me to think that there is a future for the earth and that there will be an accomplishment of everything that is for God.
Ques. Is that the sum and substance of our hope -- that all God's interests for the earth are centred in Christ?
F.E.R. Yes, and the fact of it is "The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come". The more we comprehend that everything is bound up in Christ, the more evangelistic we should be down here.
Ques. What would you say is being 'evangelistic'?
F.E.R. To bring before men's minds the head. "The head of every man is Christ". All evangelisation is summed up in that.
Rem. We generally present Christ as Saviour.
F.E.R. I do not think that goes quite far enough, because you want to present Him as head, that bringing in the idea of living water.
Ques. How would you explain to me that Christ is the "head of every man"?
F.E.R. "Thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day; and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations". He is the head of every man and repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be preached among all nations.
Ques. What is "among all nations"?
F.E.R. I do not know except what it says. It is put in an abstract kind of way, so that anybody can take it up.
Ques. Is it not the work of the Spirit of God to form Christ in us?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. It is the well of water springing up into everlasting life. The Spirit of Christ works in us attachment to Christ, and deliverance from the world. Ishmael goes out and Christ comes in. It is only
{104}
in that way that you make any progress. You get the appreciation of Christ and that produces attachment to Christ.
Ques. Would you say that the effect would be, that we should be more Christ-like in our ways?
F.E.R. No doubt it would result in that, but the first thing is that we should answer to the mind of God, and I have no doubt whatever that Christ should be seen in us.
Ques. "I will not leave you orphans, I am coming to you". He comes to us and we go to Him. Is that when we break bread?
F.E.R. He will only come to us on condition that we leave the world. That is the idea of the assembly to me -- we leave the world and He comes to us. In that sense we are orphans, we find ourselves in that way in a sphere where divine affection flows.
Ques. What is meant by the expression, 'being prepared for the assembly?'
F.E.R. The question which arises in my mind is this: are you prepared for the fellowship of His death? That is the first great thing as to the preparation for the assembly, because if you accept the fellowship of His death, you will give up every interest here. Of course you are committed to His death in baptism; but the fellowship of His death is that you will give up every interest here -- for Christ has no interest here now.
Ques. Is not that the great idea of eternal life?
F.E.R. Yes, it is out of death into life. So far as my experience goes, it does not seem that people are so particularly eager to surrender every interest on earth. That is what fellowship with the death of Christ is.
Ques. Do you think that we find very few 'crucified men'?
F.E.R. I do not think a very great many enter into it. That man would have no interest here. He has accepted what you may call an ignominious death; and one who takes sides with the Lord would have to go
{105}
into death. If a man does not accept the death of Christ, he does not reach Christ where He is.
Ques. What is the difference between 'dying daily', and being dead with Christ?
F.E.R. They are two entirely different things. 'Dying daily' was that he was daily exposed to death at the hand of man, but 'The fellowship of His death' is the state of the christian's mind -- the mind of the christian is in accord with the death of Christ.
{106}
THE WITNESS
@Revelation 1: 17; 3: 11
I have no thought of attempting an exposition of these addresses to the churches; I want to speak of what the church is as witness, and what succeeds when it fails as witness. In the first of these addresses we get the church in its normal place, the place of witness. It is the only address in which allusion is made to the candlestick. When it ceases to be a witness here it is never restored. So far as the actual fact is concerned, the candlestick is hardly taken out of its place yet. The church is still responsibly in the place of witness, but you read no more of the candlestick. But then another order of things follows: not exactly witness, but life. Life comes in, and you can always fall back upon that, and it is a great thing to fall back upon. You will find the same principle pervading the writings of the apostle Paul. When things were normal, we get the epistle to the Ephesians, and that is the church as witness; but when the church has failed, the apostle has to look the failure in the face, and he falls back upon life. We can make nothing now of witness or testimony, but we can fall back upon life, and that is very important. It is what comes out in these two addresses. The great point in the present day is life, and life must, in a sense, be individual.
Now I will speak a little about witness, and the place of the church as witness. You cannot give up a right thought, even if you see that a right thought can never again be realised down here: a right thought is ever your standard. I think that is one great reason why Scripture has been given to us, that we might have a perfect standard. In days of defection people are led back to the standard, and the effect upon them is they depart from evil. It was so in the time of Josiah; the king was brought back to the standard, and the state of things was judged
{107}
by it. The same applies to the present day; when any kind of revival has occurred amongst saints, they have been led back to the standard, and were thus able to judge the defection. But then, the standard would not build people up; for that you want the power of the Spirit of God. Life can only be by the Spirit of God. Doctrine is not life; the Spirit is life. The well of water springs up in the believer into everlasting life; saints are built up in the energies of life. That is a great thing in a day of departure. It was pointed out years ago that in the later epistles, where the apostle is addressing himself not to churches but to individuals, he takes the ground of an apostle according to the hope of eternal life. There was no hope of the restoration of the church; and eternal life becomes to a large extent the point in the epistles to Timothy and Titus.
Now one word in regard to the witness. I think there was in the ways of God a kind of continuation of witness. So long as Christ was upon earth He was the great witness here of divine love: He declared God. Now when Christ comes in again He comes as the faithful and true witness; you get that lower down in the third chapter. But in the meantime the church is the witness, and expressions which were used in regard to Christ Himself are used in regard to the church. The Lord speaks of Himself as the light of the world; the church is the light of the world. He was the witness; the church is the witness: that is its normal place, a witness for God here, a living witness. It is the living expression down here of the love of God -- that is the true place of the church; and not only witness of the love of God, but of the wisdom of God.
Now I will just ask your attention to a scripture or two in that connection -- @John 17: 20, 21. There you get the unity of the saints, and that as a proof that the Father sent the Son that the world might believe. Now pass on to @Ephesians 3: 14 - 21. I think this prayer brings before us not simply the thought of unity, in which the saints were
{108}
the witness that the Father sent the Son, but the competency of the church as witness. Nothing could go beyond this prayer in regard to witness. Now I call your special attention to the way in which divine persons are connected in this prayer with the church. The saints are to be strengthened of the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, by His Spirit, with might in the inner man, the object being that the Christ may dwell in their hearts by faith. Now, the subject of all testimony in Scripture, beyond contradiction, is Christ: "They are they which testify of me". So in @2 Corinthians 3: "who has also made us competent, as ministers of the new covenant; not of letter, but of spirit"; and then, following upon the parenthesis which succeeds, you get, "The Lord is the Spirit". I am warranted in saying that Christ is the subject of the Scriptures. You will admit that the source of the Scriptures is the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, the immediate power by which the Scriptures have been indited is the Spirit, and the subject of the Scriptures is Christ. Now, the saints were to be strengthened with all might, that the Christ might dwell in their hearts by faith, that they, being rooted and grounded in love, might be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height, that they may be filled unto all the fulness of God. What I want to point out in that is the competency of the witness. They were to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge. You can get no further. That was the competency of the church, and the end of it was that they might be filled unto all the fulness of God. What I understand that to imply is that the church was an adequate witness of God here in the world; it was not simply a witness by word of mouth, but morally. I could not give an exposition of the prayer in @Ephesians 3 but it is one of the most remarkable passages you can find; it brings before us the mind of God in a most wonderful way.
I refer to two other passages -- @1 John 4: 11 - 14 and @John 1: 18. In the gospel of John, Christ was the witness
{109}
who declared God; in the epistle it says, "No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us". We are thus the witness here of the love of God. Then the apostle says, "Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world". That is, the saints are here, the love of God is perfected in them if they love one another; and He has given them of His Spirit, and they bear witness.
There is one more passage -- @1 John 5: 10, 11. The apostle says, "this is the witness, that God hath given to us eternal life". Read that in conjunction with what comes out in the previous verse: it is the witness that God has given of His Son. The church is looked upon as being in eternal life, and that is the witness which God has given of His Son. God has accomplished His purpose, the purpose for which the only-begotten Son came into the world (@John 3: 16), and the accomplishment of that purpose is the testimony that God has given of His Son. Now you see the place of the church in witness here upon earth: witness to the Son of God, the love of God, the wisdom of God -- an expression of all the fulness of God. No one can speak about it at the present time with any great amount of power, because the witness is so obscured; but you can get the divine idea of it, and the effect will be that you will not care to have fellowship with anything that tends to obscure the witness. The witness will never come out in clear light again down here; it will come out in the heavenly city. I do not believe the candlestick will ever be brought back to its place, but I get the idea of the candlestick, and anything which tends to obscure the light I would seek to be apart from. As to the christianity current in the present day, I would not have anything to say to it; every day I live I desire to be more apart from it, because it is a great veil which obscures the witness of the church.
{110}
If you have followed the passages I have quoted, I beg you not to let them drop with the occasion. Try and gather up the idea of what the mind of God was in regard to the witness of the church down here upon earth.
Now I turn to @Revelation 2: 2 - 7. You see the departure there from the place of witness. The proof of it is plain, in that the Lord threatens to remove the candlestick out of its place unless there is repentance. I need hardly tell you that the church at Ephesus has long since ceased to exist; so has every other church in Asia Minor. The whole country was overrun by Mohammedanism, and the light of the church there extinguished. But that was only local. You may look at things in a broader way than that, that is, as to the church in general, for Ephesus is only a sample of the church in the place of witness. You will readily connect what I read with the prayer in @Ephesians 3, which gives the idea of the church in the place of witness. Here the church has lost its witness, and the secret of it is that it has left its first love. When the church lost the sense of association with Christ, then, I do not doubt, it left its first love. I believe the idea of the church is set forth in figure in Aaron and his sons. There might not be any particular link of affection between Aaron and his sons; but in Christ and the church the bond is affection. His pre-eminence is the pre-eminence of affection. The bond of affection is in power in the sense of our being risen with Him according to the mind of God, and quickened together with Him by the work of God. So long as that was maintained the church was the witness; when the Head was let go the church ceased to be a witness. I have no doubt the secret of His being let go was unwatchfulness. People came in unawares, even unbelievers, and in that way spirituality declined, and eventually the witness was obscured. The church increased in worldly importance, but the influence of earth and of the world came in, and the witness was obscured. It has been said that the purest water spilt upon earth becomes mud. You get an idea from the passage I have read as to
{111}
the mind of God in regard to the church; but when the church came under the influence of earth everything became mixed; the witness was obscured, and the Lord takes account of this. Nothing escapes the eye of the Lord, and to my mind this is a great comfort. There never was a phase of the church as to which the Lord had not His particular mind. It is a great comfort, for it brings the sense to me of a living Head, who has His mind as to every moment and in every phase of the church's history. If I apprehend that, I shall desire to be in the secret of His mind, and then I would seek to be faithful to His mind, not to thwart it or to go on with anything which is not in accordance with it. He has His mind in regard to the church at this moment, as much as He had at the beginning. Laodicea is a very evil phase, but Christ has His mind in regard to that. If anyone there heard His voice and opened to Him they would come into accord with His mind.
Now I have tried to make clear what is before me, and that is, to give an idea of the place of the church as witness, and its suitability for it. The witness was competent and suitable, but as a matter of fact the church left its first love, and when it did so, it ceased to be a witness. When it left its first love, human order came in; and that was, I suppose, almost the first sign of departure on the part of the church. The power of the Spirit declined, saints lost the sense of association with Christ, and then there was nothing left but to establish human order. When human order came in, the church ceased to be the witness which God intended it to be down here. Of course it has the responsibility of being witness until it is taken out of the place of witness, but morally it ceased to be witness when it left its first love; and although the Lord admonishes to repentance, yet, as a matter of fact, the church has never regained the place of witness which it lost.
Now if you pass on to Smyrna (verses 8 - 11), the striking points in regard to this church are as to death and life --
{112}
life out of death. Christ brings Himself before the church in that way -- "... which was dead, and is alive". I want to show the present application of that. The state of things then was analogous to what is here now. When the Spirit of God began to work at the beginning of the present century, there was restoration, in a small way, to what was seen at Ephesus. The saints were devoted and unworldly; they were largely in the reality of first love. But even that little bit of witness declined. You will never see it restored. There has been such a state of things even in the present century, in the power of the Spirit of God. And what about us? We come in for a good deal of what is written to Smyrna, "I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty". It is a time of tribulation and poverty, not a time of honour. There was a moment in Ephesus when the witness was in honour; but the present is a time of tribulation and poverty. There is no great energy amongst us; I think you will admit that we deplore the loss of vitality. And I think, too, there is the endurance of 'blasphemy'; those who have come out from all that is around, and have sought to get to the Lord, are not well spoken of; they are the subject of blasphemy from the synagogue of Satan. There is a synagogue of Satan still: people whose confidence is in earthly order and succession here upon earth. They would speak evil of all that is really in the Spirit of God. "Ye shall have tribulation ten days". You get tribulation, only the tribulation is limited. "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life". This is a great principle; death is the true way to life. Faithfulness unto death gets its answer in the crown of life. It was a time of real persecution in that day, though limited, when saints needed to be faithful unto death, and the Lord would give them the crown of life. But we, too, want to be faithful unto death, and death is the test of faithfulness. People do not like death. If you saw the great gain that lies on the other side of death, you would be faithful unto death. I think we shirk it; we want to go on more or
{113}
less in conformity with the world. Many who would not go to theatres and such like want a certain amount of worldly recognition, and go on with the amenities of the world. The point is, "Be thou faithful unto death". I do not want to give a curious or fanciful interpretation to the passage I only take it up as a principle -- faithfulness unto death is the way of life according to God. If we have died with Him, we shall also live with Him. We reckon ourselves to have died indeed unto sin. If a man takes the ground of being alive in the world, I can hardly understand how he can be alive unto God. The principle of being alive unto God is that you have died -- "died to sin"; and when Scripture speaks of sin, it implies the world, for the world is dominated by sin and lawlessness.
Now one word as to life. I think life practically is the enjoyment of the relationships in which it has pleased God to place us. In one sense, it is the power to enjoy the relationships; in another sense, it may be spoken of as the enjoyment of the relationships. If I speak of business life, I mean the associations and connections of business. Family life is in the affections and associations and connections of the family. And so in divine things.
Life according to God is the enjoyment of the relationships and associations in which it has pleased God to place us -- not the natural relationships, but the spiritual ones; and if we are to enter into the enjoyment of these spiritual relationships there must of necessity be the fellowship of the death of Christ. If we are not prepared to accept that, we are greatly hindered in the enjoyment of the relationships of life.
Now it is a great thing to be in the enjoyment of eternal things. We have a great deal to do with temporal things, but they are all transient; the great point is to be living in the relationships with which life according to God is connected. There is no single relationship of earth but what is dominated by death, but the relationships which God has been pleased to establish are all connected with a living God. It is impossible to connect
{114}
the thought of a dead world with a living God. All the relationships which God has been pleased to establish in grace are living, because they are of the living God, and the point for us is to accept the fellowship of the death of Christ, to be faithful unto death, so that we may lay hold of that which is really life. The point is, to lay hold on that which is in connection with the living God. There is no thought in Scripture which is more suggestive to my mind than the expression, "the living God". We read of the Son of the living God, the Spirit of the living God, the church of the living God, the service of the living God, the word of the living God -- all is living. Now the great thing for us is to be faithful unto death, to accept the death of Christ in regard to the world system around us, that we may lay hold of that which is really life. The crown is the consummation; you cannot get that until the Lord comes, but there is such a thing now as to be past death. We are quickened with Christ, in order that we may enter upon the domain of life, but the region of life lies on the other side of Jordan. I do not want to distort the passage, but I think you may accept the principle. You cannot make much now of the witness of the church. People have talked about "our testimony". I have no sympathy with any such expressions. A servant of the Lord once said, if we were a testimony to anything, we were a testimony to the ruin of the church. The witness is obscured, and I would have no fellowship with what obscures it, but we have something to fall back upon, and that is, the great and blessed realities of life. We may be reviled and blasphemed, but the point is, "Be thou faithful unto death". Imagine what a thing it will be to receive the consummation from the hand of Christ. You have accepted the fellowship of His death, and He gives you the crown of life.
Then you get an important word to the overcomer, and that is, that he will not be hurt of the second death. I look upon the second death as moral death. Of course it is the lake of fire, but those in the lake of fire are shut
{115}
out for ever from the light of God and all that flows from it. There is nothing to succeed it; it is final, "the second death". May God give us grace that we may be prepared to accept the fellowship of Christ's death, that we may come now into the blessed region where the Son of the living God lives.
{116}
THE LOVE OF GOD IN ACTIVITY AND IN REST
@John 1: 12; @Ephesians 1: 3 - 6
I desire to make a few remarks on the difference between divine love in its application to us as saints on earth in our individual path, and in its application to us as privileged to be in association with Christ in a scene where God can rest in entire complacency, all being suitable to His glory. The first connects itself with our position as children in the presence of God, and the second with sonship and the assembly. A difficulty in understanding the matter may arise from the fact that, though both thoughts cannot be realised at the same moment of time, both are true now of believers.
The first thing to be apprehended is our present recognised place down here as before God. We are evidently in the kingdom of God, justified and under the sway of grace. The same will, I apprehend, be true of Israel hereafter, but this does not fully describe the position of christians, they are "children of God". The children of the Queen are in the kingdom, and subject to its ordering and laws, but they are none the less the children of the Queen -- and christians as begotten by the revelation of God's nature, and partaking of that nature, cannot be less than children of God -- when the world knew not its Creator, and "his own" received not the light which had visited them; then it was that God saw fit to set forth His children. I judge that the object was that there should be those here who were morally according to Christ. I think that any careful study of the Lord's ministry on earth must end in the conviction that the purpose of His teaching was to lead the minds of those who listened to Him into the sense of being children. This is summed up in @John 1: 12, "But as many as received him, to them gave he the right
{117}
to be children of God, to those that believe on his name". In accord with this we have in @1 John 3: 1, "See what love the Father has given to us, that we should be called the children of God;" and in @Romans 8: 16, "The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God".
The great point in reference to children is that they are in the light of divine love, and able to appreciate and enjoy the light because begotten of that love. "In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him". If we apprehend that God began, and not we, then we can understand our place as children; a new generation, called out of darkness into light, to shine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life. Now the relationship of children, though connected with the idea of perfectness in practice -- for we are to be perfect even as our Father in heaven is perfect -- hardly conveys the idea of perfectness in point of state. Hence it is that such thoughts as discipline, purging, divine care, and exhortation to obedience are brought out in connection with it; and these thoughts are perfectly consistent with love. Discipline is an expression of a parent's love, and the absence of it would indicate rather the contrary. On the other hand keeping God's commandments is the evidence we give of love to God, and to talk of love apart from it would be vain on our part. A reference to @John 15 and to @Hebrews 12 will shew the way in which the Father's love is exercised in regard of us, and the end which it has in view. It is vigilant and active -- for God withdraws not His eyes from the righteous -- it humbles us in exposing tendencies in ourselves of which we were probably unaware and our own inability to overcome them -- but all in view of the peaceable fruits of righteousness as the end of exercise, and, in result, of our becoming partakers of God's holiness. But concurrent with that we have the Spirit bearing witness with our spirit -- our hearts are
{118}
being divinely instructed in the disposition of God towards us, and thus we are led into the enjoyment of liberty and confidence toward God. But all this, vitally important as it is to us, does not speak of love in rest -- but in vigilance and activity. In connection with it comes in also the service of priesthood, as in Christ's intercession for Peter that his faith should not fail. I think that I have said enough to indicate the relation of love towards us in the place of children here. It is made perfect in the day of judgment in that as Christ is, so are we in this world.
But I desire now to touch for a moment on the thought of love in rest -- and this I judge must connect itself with perfectness in the state of those who are the objects of that love. It is in this connection that we can apprehend Christ as the centre of the throng in a scene filled by divine glory, and in which all is according to that glory. I suppose that sonship is that in which this is fulfilled in regard of us. Sonship properly belongs to heavenly places, and connects itself with a state which is entirely of, and according to, God. He has chosen us to be holy and without blame before Him in love. Now love can rest here, where all is suitable to God's glory.
The question naturally arises how far can this be realised by us now? The answer is that we are encouraged of God to accept the truth of association with Christ; perfected for ever as to conscience. We are risen with Christ, and the work of God in us has been with the view that we might be capable for the holiest, at least in the point of affections. On the other hand it is in the power of God through Christ's death to view saints simply in the light of the holy affections which He has wrought in them, as in the case of the prodigal, apart from all that is connected with responsibility, or that would call for the exercise of discipline. Such things do not come into the thought of the holiest -- where all is necessarily of God and according to His glory.
{119}
<blockquote>'Glory supreme is there, <br>Glory that shines through all; <br>More precious still that love to share, <br>As those that love did call'.</blockquote>
It is properly the privilege of heaven, though enjoyed now, in assembly, by those who have through grace been led to accept the truth of the calling, have forsaken all that they have that they may be disciples of Christ. It makes nothing of us, for we must feel how small we are in regard of these things, but it is none the less the proper inheritance of the feeblest saint, and to enter into it gives us a foretaste of God's eternal rest.
{120}
CHRIST AS HEAD OF EVERY MAN
@Romans 5: 12 - 21
F.E.R. We get here the mode in which God's grace has reached man; it is by one Man, and what has come in at the present time by the gospel is the test of all men; the gift of grace by one Man.
Ques. In what way?
F.E.R. In the sense that everything is resolved by it -- what is for God, and what is not for God is all resolved by the question of the grace of God, and His gift by grace. It fills up responsibility.
Ques. The "true Light, which lighteth every man", Is it like that?
F.E.R. Yes. "He that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God". Christ is become the test of man; the state and condition is exposed. The final result is brought about by it. "For this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit". @1 Peter 4: 6.
Ques. What does that verse mean?
F.E.R. It presents an alternative; it is the effect of the gospel. On the one hand it completes the ground of responsibility, but on the other its reception results in living according to God in the Spirit, the judgment is accepted on what they are as men in the flesh. "Them that are dead", that is, they had filled up their course on earth either for good or for evil. It is a great point to apprehend that Christ has become the test. Everything is brought to an issue over Christ. If God has introduced all blessing through one Man, the question is, how men receive the testimony of it. "One righteousness towards all men for justification of life".
Ques. Is there not an alternative headship? An unconverted
{121}
man would be under Adam as head?
F.E.R. There is no headship of Adam, Christ is head of every man. Adam was the figure of Him who was to come, it is no longer the figure, but the One figured.
The grace of God, and the gift by grace is by one Man Jesus Christ. He is Head of every man; "Lord" expresses authority. Adam had not authority exactly over his fellow men, but all took their character from him. The head stands in relation to all, and his acts have their bearing upon the whole family. Man was left without a head when Adam died; eventually nationality came in, and confusion -- there was no head.
Ques. But the head transmits his qualities to the race?
F.E.R. The bearing of what takes place in the head is toward all. Christ has taken up that place in regard of man, and so the bearing of all He has brought in is towards all. "The many" is in contrast to the few who were under law. As far as I understand the matter, headship was the only possible way in which God could approach man in grace. Reconciliation could not take place except by the introduction of a Head.
Ques. Is that what comes out in the beginning of Luke?
F.E.R. Yes. The instant the Head was there, reconciliation was in principle there. Man under the judgment of God could not as such be reconciled, all that God could do was to judge him. It was a moral impossibility for reconciliation to take place in him; there was nothing for that man but death; reconciliation comes in, in the introduction of a Head.
The thought of reconciliation between man and man is very different from reconciliation as between God and man, because man is the creature of God. Think of the condition in which man was by the fall! Under sentence of death, and therefore it was an impossibility for that man to be reconciled. The righteous judgment of God
{122}
must have its place, and reconciliation involves the introduction of another man; that is where the truth of the Head comes in. You must have a Man who is great enough to take up the liabilities of every man: that all may have their part in that death and receive life from Him. God finds His pleasure in one Man, and that Man stands in relation towards all men; believers stand as objects of the pleasure of God in that Man. "We are making our boast in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom now we have received the reconciliation".
It is possible to preach to men the benefits of the death of Christ without preaching Christ Himself.
There can be no illustration of reconciliation in human things, because in human things you can never have the relation that exists between God and man.
Ques. When did man come under the new headship?
F.E.R. When the new Head came in. You now present the Head to man; you testify of reconciliation. When Christ came, there was a point of complacency in man for God, and the One in whom the complacency rests stands in relation to all men; all that is in the Head is available for men. "To him give all the prophets witness", &c. -- the Head.
Ques. What is the difference between presenting the Head and the Saviour?
F.E.R. The Head *is* the Saviour. In a general way in the New Testament, God is presented as the Saviour.
Every man is under the Head, but all do not acknowledge the Head; they do not care to accept the truth; but Christ is the test of every man.
There cannot be two heads. The one head has died and passed away; if men do not accept the headship of Christ, they virtually claim to stand on their own platform; they refuse to stand on the new platform.
Ques. What is the difference between Head of every man and Head of the church?
F.E.R. The church stands in relation to Christ, not only He in relation to her. The moment you accept the
{123}
Head, you stand in relation to Him.
In @Romans 5 it is not a question of a new race, but of the Head that has come in. Reconciliation in the bearing of it is towards all men, "Be ye reconciled to God". It may be a long time before a christian is prepared to enter into reconciliation, but the bearing of it is towards all men. So, too, as to the new covenant. There is nothing in the new covenant but what is the disposition of God towards all men; not towards a special people, though He may make the covenant effective in special ones.
The governing thought in all preaching should be to present Christ. Philip "preached Christ in Samaria". "*By him* all that believe are justified". It is not a question of a new race, but of the grace and blessing that are by one Man towards all men. J.N.D. has said: "You could go to a man in the street and tell him he ought to answer to his Head".
Ques. What is denying the Lord who bought them?
F.E.R. Those who do so are apostate. Christianity is death to the old condition, and you count yourself alive in Christ. You accept Him as Head, you get the Spirit -- living water from the Head; you count yourself alive in the Head. Only a man who has the Spirit can do that.
In @Romans 6 you may note the change from "through" to "in" Christ.
It would have been useless for a head for man to come in, if he could not impart life to man. The qualification of Christ to be Head is that He can impart life to man. He is a life-giving Spirit. This is seen in the breathing in @John 20.
Everybody ought to see that it was impossible for God to approach man *as man*, in grace, apart from Christ, because he was under His judgment.
The wisdom of God is that He brings in a Head who can impart living water to man after having taken up the liabilities of man. You are now alive in the Head, and dead to all you were once alive in.
In *that* Man God can address every man. Christ is
{124}
the test; souls come in contact with a *Person*, not simply with a *doctrine*. The great end in view on God's part is that man might live. Christ must take up the question raised in the tree of responsibility that He may become the tree of life.
@John 3: 16 presents the divine thought of eternal life for man.
@John 4 is the way in which the believer is to come into it. The person who is to have it is the believer, but he does not get at it by faith. The question of good and evil is solved in the cross (chapter 3), and then (chapter 4) Christ is a life-giving Spirit.
He is, too, the Sun of righteousness, and it is by walking in relation to Christ that you walk in the path of God's will. It is not possible that man is going to be without rule, the law of Christ. It is as moving in relation to Christ -- as married to Him -- that you can walk in the path of God's will down here, and bring forth fruit to God. In the gospel man is called upon to accept the Head; it is the divinely-appointed relationship, and God could not approach man in grace in any other way. He might have approached him in judgment.
You accept Christ as Head, you appropriate Him as Lord. Salvation is connected with the Lord. @Romans 10 is on that line; you confess Him as Lord; it is the habit of the person, and in this way you are delivered from every other lord.
In connection with lordship you get two lines -- administration and subduing power on the one hand, and authority and judgment on the other. If you confess Christ as Lord, you get deliverance from the power of evil.
@Acts 9 is full of the administration and subduing power of the Lord, it is magnificent. He subdues Saul to Himself; He directs Ananias; cities turn to the Lord; it even goes on to a kind of millennial picture at the end of the chapter.
In @Romans 10: 9 you believe that Christ is raised from
{125}
the dead, and you confess Him as Lord. Salvation is connected with the Lord.
With Israel in Egypt you get righteousness in connection with the blood on the lintel and side-posts. Being brought through the Red Sea was salvation.
@Romans 10 brings into prominence salvation rather than righteousness. It is in submitting to righteousness that man gets salvation. Israel did not go the right way for salvation. The way to salvation is to believe to righteousness; you submit to the righteousness of God.
Baptism is in the name of Jesus as Lord.
The "*heart*" (@Romans 10: 10) connects you with the Head; the "*mouth*" with the Lord. Confession is the proof of faith.
Christ was a life-giving Spirit when on earth, but He must take up man's liabilities before He could give life to man. Christ's presence was in anticipation of His work, and God could take up things as though the work were accomplished. God could go on different ground. Why did He not impute trespasses? Because Christ was going to take them up. The thought of eternal life hardly connects itself with heaven, but you lose nothing by going to heaven.
Ques. "To know thee", &c., @John 17?
F.E.R. That is not heaven; knowledge is always in measure and passes away; when we get to heaven there is no knowledge.
Eternal life is the energy of life and blessing in Christ, which renders impotent all the forces of evil.
The energy of life in Christ brings profound relief and blessing to man.
{126}
THE PRESENCE AND OPERATIONS OF THE SPIRIT
@John 14: 1 - 27
E.C. I should like to know a little more about what you said regarding the Spirit as truth, and His operation in the christian -- such as we get in @John 14 in connection with His presence.
W.W. What was that? will you repeat the suggestion?
E.C. Some further light as to the presence of the Spirit and the manner of His operation in the christian and in the church starting from that expression, "The Spirit is the truth". Some further development as to the way it is to be understood.
D.L.H. Did I understand correctly this morning that the thought of the Spirit of truth is the revelation of God manward, and the word of God the other way -- man to God?
F.E.R. Nothing short of the revelation of God comes up to the idea of *the truth*. There is "*the* truth" and "truth," but nothing short of the revelation of God could be designated as *the* truth. When Christ is spoken of as the truth and the Spirit as the truth, both are connected with the revelation of God. I think you get light on it in @1 John 2: 20, 21: "But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things. I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth". The truth seems bound up with the revelation of God.
F.H.B. Would it not embrace the idea of our relationship with the Father and the Son?
F.E.R. I doubt it. It says, the Spirit is *the truth*.
F.H.B. But I thought that Christ in glory is the expression of the mind of God as to man?
F.E.R. Yes; but He is also the truth.
Ques. Where is it said, "The Spirit is the truth"?
{127}
F.E.R. In @1 John 5. It is a proposition which is reciprocal. The Spirit is the truth, and the truth is the Spirit. Christ has come as the revelation of God, and the Spirit bears witness. He bears witness to the truth, but He is Himself the truth.
F.H.B. The Spirit is to witness of Christ in glory.
F.E.R. Yes; He bears witness, but He is also the truth.
P.C. Is that because He expresses what is revealed of God?
F.E.R. Yes.
E.C. Is that in Himself or in the christian?
F.E.R. He dwells in the christian to affect him by all that has come to light in Christ. No one can enter into the knowledge of God save by the Spirit. Christ is "the truth" objectively. The Spirit is "the truth" subjectively, that is, in the believer. The first work of the Spirit in the believer is to establish the revelation of God in him. He brings home to us the way in which that revelation has come out.
Ques. Is it done by ministry?
F.E.R. No; by divine power. No ministry can effectually lead you into the knowledge of God. You can only know God by the Spirit. The Spirit establishes the revelation of God in our hearts, so that they may be governed by what God is. I could not tell you how, but divine love is made effectual in us by divine power.
Ques. Then what is the good of ministry?
F.E.R. It brings the mind of God under the attention of saints, but it does not by itself effect any result in us. It is a mistake to suppose that it effects anything in itself.
Ques. What does?
F.E.R. Ministry tends to bring about exercise, and it is by the exercise the Spirit works to bring something about in us.
G.G. Is the exercise produced by the Spirit?
F.E.R. Yes; there is no result wrought in anybody until there is exercise; ministry may occasion exercise,
{128}
but the Spirit must make it effective.
A.S.L. You say the Spirit is the truth in the believer?
F.E.R. Yes. Every believer in having the Spirit has the truth in himself, only he may not be prepared for it.
The babe has the truth in its entirety in having the Spirit, but it may be that he has but little of it wrought in him. There growth comes in.
A.H. You have said somewhere that it took God to reveal God, and it takes God to make God known in us.
F.E.R. It takes God to make us know God, but the truth in its entirety is in the christian because the Spirit is there, all else is growth in it. Most people are content to have the truth in the Spirit, and are not anxious about its being wrought in themselves. It is the difference in a sense between Romans and Ephesians and Colossians. In @Romans 5 and 8 we have everything in the Spirit. In Ephesians and Colossians the language is changed. It is "you hath he quickened". In Romans there is nothing about quickening as in the present or putting on the new man, but there is in Ephesians and Colossians.
D.L.H. Ministry is for the perfecting of the saints?
F.E.R. Yes; but as a question of intelligence. Gift keeps God's mind under the attention of the saints; but having the Spirit you are independent of man. You have everything in the Spirit. "Ye need not that any man teach you". The Spirit is the truth in the saints.
Ques. "Thy word is truth?"
F.E.R. That is characteristic. There is a shade of difference between truth and *the* truth.
Ques. "He that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest". What is that? Is it confined to the beginning?
F.E.R. No; any one practising truth cometh to the light that his deeds might be made manifest. Christ was in that way the test. The truth came as light, and brought out where every one was, and the one who did truth came to the light. When a man is acting with regard to God
{129}
he is doing truth. Old Testament saints who acted in reference to God as far as He was known, were doing truth.
Ques. "The same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him". Was not this always true?
F.E.R. You could not say that the truth was here until Christ came. Truth came by Christ. He is the truth. But the truth having come, it has to be maintained, and the maintenance of the truth now is by the Spirit. The revelation has come, and the power that maintains the revelation is the Spirit of God. The maintenance of the revelation is entirely dependent on the Spirit, and nothing can sweep it away. Christianity is maintained by divine power; there is no cause for any fear as to it. No power could get rid of the Spirit, even if the Scriptures could be got rid of.
F.H.B. The Spirit is here, and maintains the truth in spite of all opposition.
W.B. How is the church the pillar and ground of the truth?
F.E.R. The Spirit maintains the truth in the church in a public way. What was revealed in Christ is maintained by the Spirit. Everything in the way of public expression or witness depends on the church.
H.H. You said we had the truth objectively in Christ and subjectively in the Spirit. How?
F.E.R. It is in this that the difference between the gospels and the epistles consists. What was presented in Christ is realised by the Spirit in the saints.
H.D'A.C. Spirit of truth?
F.E.R. It is the spirit of truth in contrast to the letter.
Ques. What is "as the truth is in Jesus"?
F.E.R. That is what is characteristic in Jesus. *The truth* is the revelation of the Father and the Son. In @John 14 the Spirit is looked at as the Comforter, the
{130}
Paraclete. Further on the Lord says of the Spirit, "he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you".
T.H.R. All this is to enable the saints to take the place of Christ down here morally, when He is absent. Christ was the truth here, and now the Spirit is the truth.
F.E.R. The revelation of God is what is to characterise christians morally. Christians are the fruit of the light, and are to display God. "That ye may be filled even to all the fulness of God".
Ques. Would it be right to say that the Old Testament saints had truth, but when Christ came there was *the* truth?
F.E.R. There were true things, but that does not rise to the idea of *the truth*. You must, I think, distinguish between truth and *the* truth; the latter is the revelation of the Father and the Son.
F.H.B. Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ?
F.E.R. That is more characteristic, it is in contrast to law. That would mean christianity. Verse 17 says, "For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ". You get two nouns, but the verb is in the singular.
H.H. How does the Spirit effectuate the truth in us?
F.E.R. I think the work of the Spirit is to quicken the saints in spiritual affections, to bring them into the full light of Christ, which is God revealed, but I could not tell you the mode of His working. We have all to come under divine teaching, and we are brought into the house of God to that end.
W.W. What does "Comforter" mean in @John 14? Is it the same as in the epistle -- the advocate who undertakes the cause of another?
F.E.R. Mr. Darby used the word solicitor or patron.
F.H.B. John speaks of the truth abiding in us. I suppose that is by the Spirit abiding in us?
F.E.R. Yes. It is not enough to take account of the
{131}
fact that the Spirit is in you, but what does He abide in you for? The first object is that the revelation of God may become effectual in us, so that we may come under the influence of the light that has been brought to us in Christ.
Ques. Is it to form us by it?
F.E.R. Yes; the only formative principle is the knowledge of God. We are defective because we have come so little under the practical effect of the knowledge of God. Nothing else is effective.
T.H.R. Nothing else would be real in us apart from the Spirit.
F.E.R. Nothing affects a man really save the light of God.
Ques. You spoke of quickening in Ephesians and Colossians in contrast to Romans?
F.E.R. We do not get quickening in a present sense in Romans. It is true you have everything in having the Spirit, but then you have to be formed in all. There is the difference between *having* the things and being *formed* in them. Take a newly born babe, what has it got?
G.G. Life?
F.E.R. I should say not in an intelligent moral sense.
Ques. What then?
F.E.R. The thing it has is sensibilities.
W.H. Then it has life?
F.E.R. If you speak of life merely physically, so has an animal, but I am speaking morally; what comes to pass with a babe is, that it finds itself in connection with relationships and affections, and by these its moral sense is formed. It finds itself the object of care and affection, and these produce affections in it; that is, life comes in in a moral sense through its surroundings. So, by the knowledge of God we are formed spiritually, and in Ephesians and Colossians the apostle can say "hath quickened us together with Christ".
T.H.R. That brings us to the assembly. Where
{132}
quickening and affections are brought in, they are assembly epistles.
Ques. Why?
T.H.R. Because that is where divine affections flow.
Ques. Is that why you say we are brought into the house of God to be under divine teaching?
F.E.R. Yes, and that is effected by making us acquainted with divine affections and care.
W.A.W. Being "born of God" is -- I have been affected by the revelation of God.
F.E.R. Yes; you have been morally affected by it. You know God and love God.
Ques. In what way would you say that a babe has sensibilities?
F.E.R. A cry is an expression of sensibility. What I meant was in connection with *new birth*. But the "babe" in christianity has more than sensibilities. It has been affected by the revelation of God, and can thus be said to be "born of God". That corresponds to @1 Peter 1: 23.
G.G. Are the sensibilities produced by the Spirit?
F.E.R. Yes. "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit", thus the sensibilities are spiritual sensibilities. Life in a moral sense results from being brought into circumstances which act upon one. J.N.D. defined life as 'The ability to enjoy the position in which God has set you'. That is life in a moral sense. How is one to enjoy the position in which we are set as sons? It can only be as having been divinely taught -- instructed in divine love. You may tell a person he is a son, but you cannot make him enjoy it. It is impossible for him to enjoy it unless he is acquainted with the disposition of God towards him, and nothing but the Spirit of God can teach you God's disposition towards you. No amount of ministry can do so. The new covenant is really divine teaching.
W.H. "The Lord give thee understanding in all things". Is that by the Spirit?
{133}
F.E.R. Yes.
A.S.L. What is the operation of the Spirit in connection with @John 7? Is chapter 4 the fountain, and chapter 7 the flowing out of the living water? Is it the activities of the Spirit?
F.E.R. In @John 4 the gift is connected with the Son of God. "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water". In @John 7 the Spirit is given in connection with Jesus glorified. In the former the Son of God had come down to make known divine love, and the Spirit was to be given to make it effective. He takes possession of the affections of the christian so that they spring up to eternal life.
Ques. Do you connect that with worship? would the effect of the springing up to eternal life be worship? Is it realised in worship when in assembly?
F.E.R. I think so. You do not really get worship till you reach eternal life.
Ques. What is the difference between eternal life here and in @John 6?
F.E.R. In @John 6 all is seen on the experimental side. In @John 4 it is on the other side-the giving of God and its character. @Romans 5 is the Spirit's work on the divine side, He makes God's love effectually known to us. In chapter 8 He acts on our side. One is going up, and the other coming down.
Ques. And in @John 7 what is it there?
F.E.R. The Spirit is connected with Jesus glorified and He brings in the new Head. It is the sense of Jesus the glorified Man there as Head.
T.H.R. It is what characterises the new Jerusalem there. You get rivers flowing out. The river flows from the new Jerusalem. In @John 7 it is blessing coming from heaven, in contrast to the Jew's feast of tabernacles, which was blessing on earth. We know Christ in heaven, and as having the Spirit we are to be contributors to this
{134}
scene, we do not want anything from it. The new Jerusalem does not receive anything from the earth but contributes to it. That is the idea of it. So we anticipate the heavenly city. Living waters flow through the belly. It is all real -- they come out through the affections. You are so in the sense of Jesus glorified that you are a source of healthful life -- inspiring influence to all around. You get the idea of a river all through Scripture. Rivers flowed out of the garden of Eden. Here it is flowing out from the affections of the believer. Mr. Stoney used to say that we are contributors to this scene.
Ques. To whom do they flow in @John 7?
T.H.R. It is the love of God flowing out to this scene.
Ques. What would be the difference between the springing up of the water, and the flowing out? Would the latter be ministry?
F.E.R. No. I do not think so. It is what was to characterise every saint, the soul being in such a sense of what has come out in the love of God that all that comes from a man is characterised by it, and has a healthful influence on others. Out of his belly flows rivers of living water. You cannot give out the good if you are not in the sense of it yourself. Everything about Christ and all that came from Him had a holy life-giving influence, all came from another world, not one bit from this world.
Ques. Should it be confined to the christian circle or everywhere?
T.H.R. Everywhere, as it will be in the heavenly Jerusalem.
W.B. That makes one ashamed of oneself.
F.E.R. Yes; but what would the world be without christians? If christian influence were taken away what kind of a place would the world be, and what *will* it be? All that is true in the believer indicates what Christ will be by and by with regard to all on earth. One great thing is, that as Christ is the Head of every man all then will
{135}
come under His healthful influence as Head. He is the source of every health-giving influence that every one might come under it. Christ is the Head of every man, and all distinctions of men are lost sight of in view of that.
Ques. Would you say that @Romans 8 is individual?
F.E.R. Romans is taken up with the individual path of the christian down here, it leads him in the path of righteousness. If I want to understand my individual path for the will of God I go to Romans. We never get to a moment where we can do without the truth in Romans. It is of the last importance to us. The truth in it does not go on to the assembly, though it may be preparatory for it. If you are in the truth of the assembly, you will carry out the instructions of Romans in your own path.
Ques. Would you say the commandments of the Lord in @John 14 go beyond Romans?
F.E.R. I do not know. I think in @John 14 the Lord is speaking more to His disciples collectively. Verse 23 is individual.
Ques. Why does it pass from the collective to the individual in this verse 21: "He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him".
F.E.R. Verse 21 is a test. All tests are presented individually. If you want to know whether you love Christ, the question is, Have you His commandments and do you keep them? John's epistle abounds in tests of that kind.
Ques. There is individual communion there. "We will make our abode"?
F.E.R. Yes, evidently so. So in the promise to the individual in Laodicea: "I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me"; but what is true to the individual can hardly come up to what you have in the assembly.
W.A.W. I suppose we are shut up to the Spirit in
{136}
these three chapters -- 14, 15, 16?
F.E.R. Yes. What can there be in this world where Christ is rejected save what is of the Spirit of God? How could anything be maintained here for God except in the Spirit of God? The chapters are in connection with the witnessing for Christ. Chapter 14 is preparatory; chapter 15, fruit-bearing; and in chapter 16 we have the witness, and then the position of the disciples is more definitely brought out in regard to things. "He shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you".
W.G.B. Do you distinguish between the Spirit dwelling in the believer and in the assembly?
F.E.R. He dwells in the assembly as being in believers. The Spirit never came upon one single individual. The Spirit came on the hundred and twenty on the day of Pentecost. The body was the vessel of the Spirit. Christ prepared the vessel, the Spirit came and takes possession of it, and by the fact of the baptism of the Holy Spirit believers were all formed into one body. We are builded together for an habitation of God by the Spirit. New birth does not in itself demand the presence of the Spirit. New birth was there before the Spirit came and will be after the church is gone, when the Spirit will consequently be no longer here. *Now* every one who partakes of the Spirit is brought into the dwelling-place of God by the Spirit. Christ prepared the material for God's house, and on the day of Pentecost the Spirit came to take up His abode, and He has been here from that day to this. By the fact of having part in the Spirit individually we are brought into the place where the Spirit is. The Spirit is in each individual, but He is not in you independently of the rest.
T.H.R. In speaking of the indwelling Spirit you have to take care that you do not separate yourself from the company upon whom the baptism of the Spirit came.
F.E.R. That is very important.
T.H.R. Each believer has the Spirit, but do not put it apart from that which is collective. It is an immense
{137}
truth that Christ's presence here on earth was succeeded by a company which Christ formed, and the Spirit came to it, and we partake in that Spirit, and we have to take care that we do not sever ourselves from that which the baptism of the Spirit formed -- the house of God.
Ques. "Filled all the house ... sat upon each". What do you make of that?
F.E.R. The *sound* filled the house, and each one partook of the Spirit. That is, the influence went further than the persons. 'Dwelling' is in contrast with Christ, who was departing. In @John 14 the Spirit was to abide -- which Christ did not. Every one of God's household partakes of the Spirit, and the Spirit undertakes to support and conduct you in your individual path here. The Spirit is connected with the individual in @Romans 8; so in @1 Corinthians 6 -- I must take care what I do with my body, because my body is the temple of the Holy Spirit.
Ques. Partakers of the Holy Spirit -- what is that?
F.E.R. That means 'companions'. People may come into the sphere of the Holy Spirit's presence and operations who have not received the Spirit.
Ques. Is it the sphere of which Peter speaks when he says, "If ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious"?
F.E.R. That raises the question whether you are really a christian or not. If you are, you taste the Lord is gracious, and then you go further. Everything for God here must be in the Spirit, and if we realise that we shall refuse everything of ourselves and of the mind of the flesh and all fleshly interests. If not we are content with the mustard-tree or the great house and the three measures of meal, but in the eye of God that is confusion.
Ques. "Drink into one Spirit", what is that?
F.E.R. "One Spirit" there it is not exactly the Holy Spirit. It indicates the end of Jew and gentile in unity.
Rem. There was nothing here for God when Christ was here save Christ.
F.E.R. We want certain sentiments that are in the
{138}
Spirit, such as patriotism and loyalty.
Ques. What sort of patriotism?
F.E.R. The love of *your* country. I do not mean of England; and we want loyalty, but in the right quarter -- loyalty to Christ. Loyalty is a great thing, but we first want the idea of God's King, and you cannot get that down here. I want to love my country, but I should not like to be a patriot in regard of so small a country as England; and I should be loyal, but with the right idea of a king, and for that I must have the Lamb and the Lion. In @Revelation 5 there are the two, and until I see the two in the King, no king will exercise much influence over me. In the Lamb you get the meekest Man upon earth, and in the Lion one strong against all evil.
Ques. But if you saw a king with fine moral qualities you would think more of him than of one who had not?
F.E.R. It is all of that man who is gone for God. Now that I have the true idea of the King. I am not going to be carried away by what man admires.
E.C. @Psalm 45 is what should characterise the true King, "And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness".
F.E.R. Yes. There you get the Lion and the Lamb. Meekness now in connection with a king would not be admired. I do not think God's King will be condescending.
{139}
GOD'S KINGDOM AND HIS PROVIDENCE
@2 Peter 1: 10 - 21
I desire to call attention to two expressions which occur in the above passage. One is in verse 11, namely, "For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ". The other is in verse 16, "For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty". Then the apostle recalls in the verses which follow what had taken place on the mount of transfiguration. Jesus received glory and honour from God the Father, when there came a voice from the excellent glory "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased". He had taken three of His disciples with Him up into the mountain, and those three were eyewitnesses of His majesty. There is one thing to be remarked about the Lord, and that is that He received nothing but what was His own. It was impossible for Him to receive anything beyond this. Everything that that voice said was properly His. I think this presents a very different idea from what we regard as glory in this world. People look for and receive recognition and glory from men in the world, but with the Lord these have no place at all. It was impossible for Him to receive honour from man; and when He received it, it came from God the Father in the declaration of who He was. Then the apostle goes on to say, "We have also a more sure word of prophecy". The word of prophecy referred to the glory of the Lord. Now, the word of prophecy was confirmed by the transfiguration, which James, Peter and John were permitted to see on the mountain, a vision of the kingdom of God.
I will say a few words on the distinction between God's kingdom and God's providence, for I fancy that people
{140}
sometimes go so far as to mistake the latter for the former. But there is God's providence, and there is His kingdom, which is the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. The idea connected with kingdom is that of authority or sway, and there is a great difference between the kingdom of God and the providence of God. The kingdom is received by faith. It comes about in this way: a man apprehends by faith the Lord Jesus, and receives the kingdom, but *every one* has to do with God's providence. There is on man's part in the present day a strong tendency to rebel against the providence of God.
I will give you one idea of the providence of God as in contrast with His kingdom. I look upon providence as a veil that hides God. God is hid from men behind the veil of providence, but when I speak of the kingdom, God is no longer hid. He is not veiled there, but made known.
Now, I believe it is a great mistake to rebel against the providence of God. A man rebelling against that practically says, 'If I had the opportunity I could rule the world better than God'. As I said, the providence of God is a veil, and to be veiled is the very opposite idea to being revealed. If you were veiled you would be hid, so God is hid by His providence. When I speak of the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ, I do not speak of a veil, but of a revelation. There are many things that I cannot understand which are allowed in God's providence. I see some men very rich and others very poor, some struggling for a bare existence, and others rolling in wealth, and this without any moral title; and that is all allowed by God in His providence. And it is perfectly useless for man to struggle against the providence of God; but the providence of God is no revelation of Him; that I press strongly. I think it is wisdom to accept the providence of God. There is great effort in the world to do away with the effects of that providence. If it were possible for man to set aside the orderings of God's providence, and to revolutionise everything, a state of things so brought about would never last; but it is impossible to do away
{141}
with the existing order of things because God's providence is stronger than man. Then there is another consideration, namely, that if as to outward things a kind of millennium could be brought about it would leave man exactly where he was before in regard to the pressure of death and judgment. It would not relieve man from that pressure. Men would die as they did before, and after death comes the judgment. It is plain to me that men will continue to rebel against the providence of God, but whatever change they can compass, it will leave them as to the most serious questions precisely where they were before. I think it is far wiser to accept the providence of God; God is perfect and therefore can rule the world much better than man can. There are many, suffering here in the world, who rebel against the providence of God; and there are others, who have a great deal of advantage in this world, and they practically worship the God of providence; but that does not alter in the slightest the fact that all are alike liable to death, and after death the judgment.
When the Lord Jesus comes, I do not think that God will be hid behind a veil of providence any longer. Wise men accept His providence now, but I do not think they will have to then. Now, I would have you mark this -- whatever a man may have under God's providence, is no sign of God's pleasure or otherwise towards him. A man may be a wicked and designing man and yet may be greatly advanced in this world's goods -- for it is an evil world -- but there is no pleasure of God in that man, because God looks not on the outward appearance, but on the heart. A man who has great natural advantages and worldly acquirements exercises a strong influence in the world by that which is outward -- his appearance. The prophet Samuel was greatly taken by the appearance of the elder sons of Jesse, and even he would have chosen one of them to be king in the place of Saul, but the answer that God made to him was, "The Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance,
{142}
but the Lord looketh upon the heart". God chose the youngest one, that was David. I believe that though a man be as rich as Croesus, and there are men with millions, God may have not one atom of pleasure in him. A man may be satiated with goods and then he himself ceases to have pleasure in them. Other people think him wonderful, but he does not think much of it himself. The wise man would seek to find out where God's pleasure is. Under the providence of God men may have many things, but they do not thus get any knowledge of His grace. The pleasure of God is in grace, and the result of grace is the kingdom. It is important to see that the result and climax of the grace of God is His kingdom, and that means the setting aside of the power of every enemy of God and man. You get a type of it in David, who set aside all the enemies of God and Israel. Death, the last enemy, will be destroyed. That is the great end of God's kingdom, and then the Son will deliver up the kingdom to God the Father. Now, the present moment is the moment of God's grace. I will tell you what God's grace is founded on. It is founded on the fact that redemption has been accomplished; God's righteousness has been vindicated and reparation for sin made to God by One who was capable of doing so. The Son of God became Man in order that He might make reparation to God. The righteousness of God has been vindicated and sin put away, and the One by whom this was effected has been raised to the right hand of God. He is exalted. He received glory and honour on the mount, and that has now been confirmed at the right hand of God. That is what has now come to pass, and all is founded on the fact that He made reparation to God.
There have been many kingdoms in this world that have passed away. The kingdom of England will pass away some day; it is not an eternal kingdom. It will be succeeded by another kingdom. The Grecian kingdom and the Roman kingdom as well as many others have one after another passed away. If you look into the foundation
{143}
of any kingdom that has existed in this world, you will find that it will not bear investigation. Now the kingdom of God exists on the foundation of righteousness -- in the reparation made to Him by the Lord Jesus Christ. It subsists on moral foundations. The righteousness of God means that sin has been put away and the power of death annulled by the sacrifice of Christ, and that is the blessed foundation on which the kingdom rests. Grace will do for a man what providence never yet did for him.
I have seen men successful in the world; wicked men often become prosperous as this world goes, and God allows this in His providence. But God in His providence does not relieve a man from the pressure under which he lies. Prosperity leaves him as to this exactly where he was before. When a man passes out of this world he has to leave everything that he has received in the providence of God here, and to face judgment.
Now, I am going to tell you what the pleasure of God's grace is. He has pleasure in the administration of relief. It is His pleasure to relieve man from the pressure and consequences of sin. I find that from Scripture. When the Israelites were in Egypt they were under the pressure of the Egyptians, their task-masters. It was God's pleasure to bring them out of Egypt, but it was not His pleasure to prosper them with silver and gold, although He did allow this in His providence. It was His *pleasure* to relieve them from the pressure of their task-masters. Job was a great man in God's providence, but he came under great pressure from Satan, and lost all his riches as well, which were afterwards restored to him. It was God's pleasure to relieve him from the pressure of death and of Satan, though in His providence he restored to him too his riches.
I pass on for a moment to the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ here on the earth. He "went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil". That is how Scripture describes His service. He was here in the ministry of peace. He preached peace towards men.
{144}
He made known that it was the pleasure of God to relieve man from the various forms of pressure under which man was suffering. He cleansed lepers, gave sight to the blind, raised the dead, and preached deliverance to the captive. He was making known, not the providence, but the pleasure of God. While the Lord was here He was always against one whom Scripture speaks of as the strong man, He first bound the strong man, and then spoiled his goods. To spoil the strong man's goods the strong man must first be bound. It was the Lord's great work to make evident to man what God's pleasure is. No evil could stand before Him. All the power of evil disappeared before Him, and He went about doing good, for God was with Him. That was in a sense the beginning of the kingdom of God. It was only the beginning of it, but it was the power of the kingdom. It was the wonderful shewing forth that there was a power down here on man's behalf superior to the power of the devil. That is what the ministry of the Lord meant. Other things had to be accomplished; Christ had to taste death for everything, by the grace of God, so that the kingdom of God might be established on solid foundations. He was raised again from the dead and exalted to the right hand of God. It is my pleasure to be able to tell you this. You can see that the exaltation of the Lord Jesus Christ has not altered the providence of God; it has left things here in that respect precisely as they were before. When the Lord Jesus Christ comes again He will change all. The Holy Spirit has now come down to make known His glory. Christ is Lord of all now.
Now I want to shew you the salvation of God. God's pleasure is expressed in the Lord Jesus Christ. I will tell you what that is. It is 'salvation'. It is summed up in that one word. I wonder if you would ask me what I mean by salvation. I mean salvation from God's judgment and from Satan's power. I will give you a picture of it in the case of the children of Israel. When they were in Egypt they were saved from God's judgment when the destroying
{145}
angel passed through, but when they had left Egypt and were on the way to the wilderness, with the sea before them and the Egyptians behind them, God saved them from the power of the enemy. I say that God's pleasure as to man is salvation. Do you know the way to it? God only calls on you to believe what really is. He does not expect you to believe anything which is visionary or unreal. He calls upon you to believe that Christ is Lord of all. It is a great thing to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, but there is one thing even beyond that, and that is to confess Him as Lord. God's pleasure is salvation. Salvation is found in receiving the kingdom of God.
Since reparation has been made to God by the Lord Jesus Christ, you have no reparation to make to Him. It is wonderful to think that we have no reparation to make. The Lord Jesus Christ has made reparation, and the proof is that God has raised Him from the dead and exalted Him to His right hand. If reparation has been made, the believer has nothing to be judged for. I am justified by faith of the Lord Jesus Christ. If a man believes on the Lord Jesus Christ, he is removed from under the power of Satan to the authority of God. It is either one thing or the other with all here. No one is really his own master. You are either under the power of Satan, or under the authority of God. The escape is from the one to the other. Man is not, and never was, and never will be a free agent. Even an angel is not a free agent. There are angels who have fallen, and angels who have not fallen; but none of them are really free agents. It is a perfect illusion for man to think that he is a free agent. You have only to know a little of the world, and you will see what man is governed by.
You will never know Christ as Lord until you have believed that God has raised Him from the dead. The believer knows that God's pleasure is in his salvation. It is the greatest possible comfort for him to know that the providence of God is a veil, and that it does not express
{146}
the pleasure of God. If I wanted to know the pleasure of God I would get behind the veil. I see that the Lord Jesus was here on earth, the expression of God's pleasure to man, and when I see Him at the right hand of God, I see expressed in him the pleasure of God. What a wonderful thing it is that I can, down here on the earth, be free from God's judgment and from the power of the enemy. I have left the authority of the enemy for the kingdom of God, and that really means that I am delivered from the power of the enemy.
But you may ask, "What about death?" I will say a few words about death. To believe on the Lord Jesus Christ really means that you pass from death into life. Reparation has been made and there is a perfect declaration of the righteousness of God in the death of Christ, and this is as true now as it was eighteen hundred years ago. It is just as true today as it was then that Christ is Lord of all. He was Lord of all then and is Lord of all now. The believer is in the light of life.
I am certain that there is no one here who has not heard of the light over and over again. To believe is to receive life. Have you believed in your heart? Have you been delivered out of the power of darkness and transferred to the authority of God? We read that with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Do you understand the value of confession? Scripture reveals that the pleasure of God is in the Lord Jesus Christ and to confess Him as Lord is to enter into that pleasure. The wealth of this world which a man may have in the providence of God does not secure his happiness.
May God bring you to understand what His pleasure is.
{147}
DISCIPLINE AND LIGHT
@Hebrews 12: 1 - 29
In order to understand the book of Hebrews it is necessary to see that it largely corresponds to what Leviticus was to the Jew. The subject of the book is approach to God, but not as Jews; there was in Israel the idea of approaching God, but not as we approach.
Exodus gives us the redemption of God's people from the power of the enemy, and the consequent setting up of God's dwelling-place among the redeemed people: so we get the detail of the tabernacle. In Numbers the people are taken account of, first, as for the wilderness, and secondly, as the people of God who were to inherit the land. This is what is typified, I suppose, in the two numberings. Both thoughts are combined in the christian.
Between the books of Exodus and Numbers we get the book of Leviticus, and the subject of that is, as I have said, approach to God; and the priests therefore come into prominence.
In the epistle to the Hebrews the truth all through is leading up to approach to God.
The Jew understood that the priests only could draw nigh; Aaron and his house were concerned with the worship of God; you can understand, therefore, the difficulty that a Jew had in understanding the common priesthood in christianity of believers; that through Jesus by one Spirit we *all* have access to the Father. Every christian must be a priest if indwelt by the Holy Spirit. There may be in many cases gift, but gift does not make a man a priest; the Holy Spirit constitutes a man a priest. Most of us have been brought up with Jewish notions regarding a priestly class as distinct from the laity, but these have no place in the christianity of Scripture.
There is another truth connected with the common priesthood of believers which comes out in Hebrews:
{148}
namely, that of boldness for entrance into the holiest, and consequently a place outside the camp. The Jew in the millennium will have neither the one nor the other. It is peculiar to the time when Christ is glorified in heaven but rejected here.
The first two chapters of the epistle to the Hebrews are introductory, then warnings follow, but in general, up to chapter 7 the epistle is occupied with the *Priest*. Even in the Old Testament we find that the whole tabernacle system depended upon the priest. The secret of our priesthood is our identification with Christ the great Priest. He leads us to worship the Father. The question is, how is the Priest so to engage us that we may be drawn to Him. He is in heaven for us; and nothing will avail for heaven but love; faith and hope have no place there; our link with Christ in the Father's presence is love. I will quote a verse that proves this: "The Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me". @John 16: 27. Hence the service on the part of the High Priest towards us is with a view to engaging our affections with Himself where He is. He is the One who makes us at home in the Father's presence. You can see thus that the whole question of the service of God depends upon the Priest and our affection toward Him. It is not difficult to get the idea in type in the case of Aaron and his sons.
The next great point in the epistle is the *sanctuary* (we have seen that the first is the Priest). The sanctuary I understand to be the full blessed light of God, as He has been pleased to reveal Himself in Christ in His purposes of grace; its character is moral, not material, and it is the Father's pleasure to have us there in the brightness of that light; that is the sanctuary as I apprehend it.
Then in the last three chapters of the epistle you get the life of faith and the christian state. Chapter 10 presents privilege and brings us to what is collective; that is in the service of the sanctuary, but the life of faith is evidently *individual*, and in it we find ourselves surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses. If you could have
{149}
placed any one of these in the circumstances of another, his faith would have found expression as in the other. Faith has *God* in view, and the *world to come*. Every witness in chapter 11 was of some principle of the world to come. As the world got darker God gave more light as to the world to come, and faith walked in view of that. The object of chapter 11 is to put you *in a line*. You have been previously looked at in your priestly place, which is privilege, but in this chapter you are in the line of those who have gone in the path of faith.
In chapter 12 two very important principles are seen -- one is the *discipline of God*, and the other the *light* of God's will. The present moment is not that of display but of mystery, and that involves *testimony*. We have now not *one* testimony, but the harmonious meeting of *every* testimony, the full light of God, which centres in Christ, at the right hand of God. When all is accomplished and in display, it is no longer a moment of testimony: but now we all, by the Spirit, behold the glory of the Lord with unveiled face, and are changed into the same image. We are accustomed to say that we are in the light as God is in the light. This is true, but I ask, are you as to the joy of your heart *practically* there? Are you in spirit outside the darkness of this world, and in the enjoyment of that light in which God has shone out? With us it is too often true, 'If clouds have dimmed my sight', and our souls are not then in the brightness. A good many things come in to obscure our spiritual vision. A man with a cataract does not see clearly. It would be a very blessed thing for our souls to be kept abiding in the full light of God's testimony.
There are two things displayed in Christ -- God's nature and His *testimony*, but I speak now of the testimony only. In order to be in the light of God's will you must accept the discipline of God. That which is of the world which attaches to us is intolerable to the holiness of God, and God's ways of grace (in which He uses discipline) are to this end, that we may be *in spirit* apart from
{150}
the course of things here. If we had any true sense of the holiness of God it would tell in our houses, in our ways and in our demeanour. Many things may in circumstances come in to try and to distress us, but God's end in all is to remove what obscures our vision, so that our souls may be in the blessed light of His testimony. This is not a question of the assembly, but that which attaches to us individually -- to be in the full light of the glory of the Lord.
I shall say a few words now about the light of the testimony. "Ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem", etc. (See verses 22 - 24). This passage presents to us God's various testimonies, and they converge at one point, and the value of this to us is that the soul should be in the full light of the things which are going to be shortly displayed. Now I see three great testimonies of God, which came out in detail in times gone by. (1) His purpose to *bless*, as seen in His dealings with Abraham; (2) His purpose to *dwell*, which comes to light in connection with Israel, "let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them" Exodus 25: 8; (3) His purpose to *rule*, which comes out in the throne of David, and which brings in view the kingdom. It is blessed to observe that all these testimonies came out in favour of man.
The law brought curse, but four hundred years previously to law, God had given to Abraham testimony of His purpose to bless, and you may be sure that there can be no such thing as sorrow in the blessing of God. Then in type was set forth the testimony that God would dwell with His people. This is even more wonderful than discovering His purpose to bless. He would set up His tabernacle among men. In connection with the tent of testimony God *moved* about with His people in the wilderness. When they dwelt in tents, God dwelt in a tent, and this was a greater witness of grace than even the temple in which God dwelt when they came into the land of fixed habitation. It is inconceivably blessed that God should
{151}
dwell with man. Then (3) He will *rule* in order to subjugate all the enemies of man and of God. This is the great end of the kingdom; the subjugation of evil, and "the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death", and when that is so, the kingdom is given up that God may be all in all. I believe in the enumeration here that we get all the testimonies. We have come to mount Sion, not to a power which strikes men with terror, but to the enduring mercy of God when man has by sin and perverseness forfeited all.
Mount Sion means sovereign mercy when we have no vestige of title. The only ground upon which any can be with God is that of the sovereignty of His mercy, and only the *elect* of God understand the sovereignty of God's mercy. "The city of the living God" is the great ruling city. Jerusalem on earth was the "city of the great King". So "Jerusalem above" is the heavenly metropolis. Then other testimonies follow "to God the Judge of all", etc. Man is not the judge -- God is the true Judge of all the actings of men. "To the spirits of just men made perfect". These men are made perfect through redemption. And Jesus is in view as the Mediator of the new covenant, and the blood of sprinkling, which witnesses to the righteousness of God established in the sacrifice of Christ. The blood of Abel was the witness of violent will, but the blood of Jesus is the witness of death accomplished for God's glory and the righteousness of God vindicated, and as a consequence there is a call for blessing, not for vengeance. Then follows the exhortation, "See that ye refuse not him that speaketh". He speaks from *heaven*. When God spoke on earth, He spoke on the ground of man's responsibility, giving him a law, but when He speaks from heaven, He speaks of that which is His pleasure, of His purposes in Christ.
In conclusion, I ask you, are you conscious of being on the ground of sovereign mercy with God? It is a great thing for us to have our hearts on those things in which He finds His pleasure. God's testimony makes known
{152}
His pleasure. May God keep our hearts in the light of His testimony. It is a greater thing to be in the light of His nature, but it is most blessed to be in the light of His testimony. If we were so habitually we should be much brighter down here, but for that we must be prepared to accept His discipline, the end of which is to make us partakers of His holiness.
{153}
THE MINISTER OF THE SANCTUARY
@Hebrews 8: 1 - 13
The ministry is the proper function of Christ as Priest; His sympathy with us is incidental to our present condition as being down here. But the service of the sanctuary is the proper function of the priest. Ministry is the service of God in the sanctuary. But if people do not understand the covenant, it is impossible that they could be up to the ministry, that is, to the service of God. Approach to God all through Scripture is according to the covenant made. Abraham had more access to God than the people had under the law. God made known in a covenant what His disposition was towards Abraham, and his liberty followed and flowed from the knowledge of God's disposition towards him. The people under the law were made to feel the extreme difficulty of approach to God; they were made to feel the distance between them and God; and for this reason, that the order of the covenant for the time being was law.
The present covenant is set forth in the death of Christ; and therefore you get "the new covenant in my blood". In proportion as you understand the meaning of the covenant, you will understand the ministry. The Lord in the Supper brought before the disciples what was God's disposition towards them; and the effect of it is to bring us into the place of worshippers.
Christ is the expression of the covenant. If you want to know the disposition of God towards you, you must see it as set forth in Christ. The two points in the covenant are righteousness and love, and these are set forth in the death of Christ; and that is to make nothing of us, we become nothing in the presence of divine love.
Righteousness comes first, because we have been actually in *sin* and we have to be assured that there is righteousness for us. Our sins and iniquities He remembers no
{154}
more. We have no more conscience of sins; but that is not what God is towards me; what He is towards me is love -- where righteousness is accomplished, love is revealed. So we get "This cup is the new covenant in my blood".
In coming together in assembly the great thing is, that our hearts should be in the sense of the disposition of God towards us. The Lord's supper thus comes in as introductory. We are called together by the Lord's supper. I do not think there is very much power in the meeting until you get the Supper. It is a sad thing if in the church God does not get His part, that is, worship; but it flows from the sense of God's disposition towards us. The secret of God getting His part is, that you know what it is to sit before the Lord, with the consciousness that God has nothing for you but *love*. If a company came together in the sense of that, I do not think they would care very much for the world; when we are sensible of God's love we respond to it. God is going to have His people in heaven to satisfy His love, and when we go, one thing is certain, that we shall drop everything of this world, we shall retain only what is of God.
If God will have the satisfaction of His love in having us in heaven, He must have satisfaction in the gathering together of the saints now. If we were all under the influence and sense of the love of God, there would be a remarkable outflow of worship. Eternal life is very simple, it is *Christ*; and if we are near to Christ, we are in the region of life.
The sanctuary is a moral idea, it is a scene of supreme rest and glory -- the scene where God has been pleased to reveal Himself; the light in which God has been pleased to make Himself known in Christ -- that is the sanctuary; but for us, all that is moral.
{155}
OUR LORD'S MORAL GLORY
@Hebrews 1: 1 - 14
Every moral quality of the Lord was of Himself. He derived nothing in that sense from man, He did not even get learning from man; the Jews said, "How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?" @John 7: 15. Whatever moral quality we see in Christ as a Man down here upon earth, the perfection of faith or confidence, or allegiance, or devotedness, nothing was derived, all was of Himself. He became Man, and in becoming Man He beautified and adorned the humanity that He took; and every real trait of beauty in humanity in His case was of Himself; He took that state and form that He might glorify God in it completely. He was manna come down from heaven, and everything was carried out down here in heavenly grace, in that which was of Himself....
I see four points in Christ; I see manhood beautified and adorned here upon earth, so that God should be glorified in man; I see God glorified in man in the putting away of sin; I see in the resurrection man accepted; and in the exaltation of Christ, man glorified; Christ is in heaven the glorified Man; and that Man is to be the glory and delight of the christian ...
The quotations in the chapter (@Hebrews 10) are taken almost exclusively from the Psalms. The quotations begin with setting forth One who is of God's nature, and is viewed as in the relationship of Son to Him -- who is the object of homage to angels -- whose everlasting throne is based on proved discrimination between righteousness and iniquity -- and who in contrast to all created things remains "the Same", and His years do not fail. For the time, all is hid in Him in the place which He as Man is called to occupy provisionally at the right hand of God, but will be displayed when the moment shall have come for His foes to be made His footstool....
{156}
Thus we have before us that blessed divine Person, who, being the effulgence of the glory and the exact expression of His substance, and upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high....
There are two cardinal points connected with christianity; one is, that Christ is Lord; and the other, that the Holy Spirit is here. They are correlative. The Holy Spirit here is the proof of the place Christ is in. He has been sent down from heaven to report the glory of the Lord. Christ is Son over God's house, but His real title to it is, that He is divine. The proof that Christ is divine is the place that He has as Man; to be such a Man He must be divine.
{157}
THE GOSPEL
@Luke 2: 8 - 14; @2 Corinthians 4: 3 - 8
The gospel is a very wide term; many passages speak of the gospel, but no one passage teaches in so many words what the gospel is, or attempts to define it. The expression has become conventional in contrast to law, and we speak of the gospel of Luke or of John, etc.; we get law and prophets in the Old Testament, but we have the gospel in the New Testament. The gospel is the approach of God to man for man's salvation. God being in the light is the foundation of it; God approaches man in grace and truth and in that very approach He makes known what He is. "The only-begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him". The moment God comes near in the only-begotten Son, He is declared in the One who is full of grace and truth.
The gospel is very little understood by many believers. The defect is in preaching the *benefits* of Christ's death instead of CHRIST Himself. If anyone asked me what the gospel was, I should say, 'CHRIST'. God addresses Himself to man in the Son (@Hebrews 1). There is a great lack of apprehension of what is bound up with Christ -- that Christ is the centre and head of a system of things. God is not labouring in connection with this world, but in connection with that system of things of which Christ is the Head. The Christ is an official title, He is the Anointed of God. Jesus is His personal name, and Christ is occasionally used personally, but generally it is *the* Christ -- the Messiah -- which is an official title. Many might be anointed besides Christ, but He is *the* anointed Man, which indicates a position which is established and maintained in Him. The prayer in @Ephesians 3 is "that the Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith"; without the article it might be personal, but "the Christ" is official. Then again *the* Christ is the Head of every man.
{158}
God is not exactly a personal name; Jehovah or Almighty would not be strictly personal. God is the supreme Being in contrast to man; He is the Author of man and of everything; it is the term or title of supremacy. There is one God in three Persons; to speak of the Father or the Son, or the Spirit conveys a personal idea. "Father" and "Son" are relative names; "Christ" is not exactly relative, it is the anointed, and we too come under the anointing; it is not relative to any other person like "Father".
Ques. Is not the mystery of the Christ the church?
No, it goes much wider than that; the body stands in relation to Christ, the church is part of the mystery of the Christ, but that mystery takes in all that will come under Christ -- the universe of bliss. Everything will take its character from Christ, and will express Christ. There is but one Man before God, and everything which comes within the universe of bliss will take its character from that Man.
The angel said, "I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people, for unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord". The angel announced glad tidings to all the people -- that is, of Israel -- but when the heavenly host come in they carry the thought wider, and speak of "good pleasure in men"; the gospel could not be confined to Israel. It is "good pleasure in men" by Christ; it refers to what is said in @Psalm 72, "men shall be blessed in him", they are blessed in Christ.
Ques. Is Christ as the new Head on the line of purpose or of responsibility?
On the line of purpose. God set forth the responsible man first, but then He sent forth His Son, the Man of His purpose, and the universe of bliss; although it is the witness of how God can recover from all the ruin that has come in, is the fulfilment of purpose. Nothing was accomplished in man himself, in Abraham or in David; all was accomplished in the Son of man, the Son of
{159}
Abraham, the Son of David. God ever had in view the incarnation -- the living bread come down from heaven. The real reason of Christ becoming man was that He might become the Head and centre of the universe of God. That is the first principle of the gospel. The gospel is sent to man that he might be delivered out of the present course of things, which is dominated by Satan, and be brought into relation to the Sun of righteousness, who is the centre and Head of the universe of God. This is effected in two ways -- by faith and by the Spirit.
We have to apprehend the light in which God views man, the position in which man is in regard of God. God has the right to the supreme place in the affections of His creatures. But man is under death and in sin, and he is liable to judgment, and in bondage to a system which is controlled by the power of evil. If God is going to approach man in grace, He must take account of what man is; not what man is in his own estimation, but as God sees him. God's grace is adapted to man as God sees him; it really meets all that was raised by the question, "Where art thou?" Three great things come in to meet all this. God comes in, first, that a man may be relieved of the fear of judgment, and secondly that be may live, and then, thirdly, that he may be delivered from the bondage in which he is held.
God delivers man first from the fear of judgment; he gets forgiveness so that he may never come under judgment; then secondly God provides that he may live -- he is under death here, but God provides that he may live; and thirdly, he gets salvation. Righteousness meets the question of the judgment; life meets the question of death; and deliverance meets the question of bondage. These three things are *good news*. We cannot get salvation until we get life. It is first righteousness, then life, then salvation.
Ques. Why is man lost?
Because he is in utter bondage to a system which is ruled by the power of evil; that is the position of a man
{160}
in the eye of God, and he needs to be delivered from it, and that is salvation. The light of God comes in first as to righteousness; that is the first point, God declares His righteousness. God comes forward in Christ, and presents Him as the commencement of a new order of things. He is the beginning and centre of another world. Paul preached Christ crucified, the end of the old man, but he also preached Christ as the wisdom and power of God, the Last Adam and the Second Man.
Ques. What is it to preach "Christ Jesus the Lord"? @2 Corinthians 4: 5.
To make known that all the authority and power and glory of God is set forth in His face.
Ques. What is the meaning of the previous verse -- "the glad tidings of the glory of the Christ"?
Why, He has got the place of pre-eminence in the universe of bliss; He is the Head and centre of that universe. Adam was the centre and head of this universe, but all that has ended, and Christ is the beginning and Head of the vast universe of bliss.
Ques. What is the meaning of the figure -- "the Sun of righteousness"?
Christ is the Sun of righteousness, and the figure is used because what the sun is to this system, Christ is to the universe of bliss. The sun rules everything in the solar system, all is held in place by the sun; and that is just what Christ is in the universe of bliss. There is light and warmth -- that is righteousness and love -- and He gives colour to everything.
Ques. What is the ministration of righteousness?
The ministration of righteousness shows how you are put in righteous relation to God; the purpose of the gospel is to put you into relation to Christ who is the centre and sun and head of the universe of bliss. In Romans you do not get life until the eighth chapter, and you get salvation there too. Salvation and deliverance are very near akin. You have to put @Romans 6, 7 and 8 together to get salvation.
{161}
People learn the gospel through those who preach, so what I want is that the preachers should preach an intelligent and intelligible gospel; but the fact is I have first to correct myself. We have no right to quarrel with a man's service, he stands or falls to his own Master, but we are entitled to see that the gospel is really known; the principle is that we speak that which we *know*. These three points have to be kept in view in regard to man's position -- judgment, death, and bondage. I might say responsibility first, perhaps, but then responsibility is enforced by judgment. Then death is man's state in the eye of God, and he is in bondage; these things are not to be gainsaid. The gospel meets responsibility by righteousness, and death by the Spirit, and bondage by salvation. The last two have been too much omitted in preaching, and people have sometimes thought that they needed salvation in regard of God. This is a mistake.
Ques. Where do you touch life in the type of Israel? "Thou hast guided them by thy strength unto the abode of thy holiness" (@Exodus 15: 13). The springing well is a clear type of the Spirit, and when the Spirit of God is brought in you touch life. You get salvation in @Exodus 14, and life is suggested in being brought to the abode of God's holiness. As to the children of Israel, they got salvation, and yet after all God was testing them after the flesh. You must remember that the two parts of Numbers (chapters 1 - 20 and 21 to the end) are contemporaneous in the history of the christian. One does not follow the other, but they go on together, The latter part of @Romans 7 does not contemplate a christian; it is before a person has become a christian in the true sense. @John 3: 16 is a statement of the mind of God; it speaks of eternal life, but the subject of righteousness is not touched.
Ques. What is a christian?
A man is a christian when he has the Spirit. "If any one has not the Spirit of Christ, *he* is not of him". The purpose of the gospel is to bring you to God in righteousness -- to put you in relation to Christ the Sun
{162}
of righteousness. Righteousness is relative, and we are estimated as righteous when we stand in relation to Christ as the earth does to the sun or the moon to the earth. It is in Christ we stand in righteousness, and that is brought about by the Spirit. When there is faith in Christ a man is justified, but there is a point further, the man must stand in relation to God.
Ques. Does that bring in the thought of the Head?
Exactly, you are justified in Christ, and Christ is the end of the law to every one who believes. Redemption is in Christ who has taken up the liabilities of men, and believers in Christ are justified. It is not a thing of sight, but a thing unseen, and we only get the good of it by faith. Redemption is in Christ Jesus, and man is brought to God in being brought into relation to Christ; being brought to Christ he is brought to God. Man meets God in Christ; God presents Himself to man in Christ, and meets man there.
In that which Christ has accomplished God has taken up His rights over every man; no one can deny that God has a right to every man, and God has taken up those rights. No doubt on the part of God the gospel goes forth to bring to light the elect, but still God has rights over every man. If a man does not believe in Christ he will get no good from the gospel. In much preaching of the gospel the great defect has been in failing to set forth Christ as He is in the mind of God -- the head and centre of a whole universe. If I am not in relation to that Man I am not in righteousness. I want people to apprehend Christ as the head of that system; this present system is all effete, it is all tinsel and death, and it all came to an end for God in the death of Christ, Now everything for man depends on standing in relation to that Man who is head and centre of God's world. Abraham, Noah, all the Old Testament saints, stood in relation to that Man. Any man who is in bondage to the world system is lost. A man in @Romans 7 is looking to himself for righteousness, but the only thing is to be in relation to Christ. Christ is
{163}
the justification of the world to come; not one word of reproach will ever be spoken against the world to come, because all is justified in Christ. We stand in relation to Christ now, and therefore come into justification. Christ is at present hidden beneath the horizon, but He is there; He has not yet arisen to Israel or the world, but He is the Sun of righteousness to us; He is the true light -- "the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ" -- and He is our justification.
Ques. Are there not three kinds of gospels: the gospel of the kingdom, the gospel of the grace of God, and the everlasting gospel?
There is only one kind of gospel at the present moment; there is only one Sun.
Ques. Why do you say that Christ is the justification of the world to come?
He takes up the world to come as having, in the grace of God, tasted death for everything; He takes all up on that ground, and therefore is the justification of everything. The righteousness of God is established in that Man, but then He is great enough to establish righteousness for all else. Man was under death, but Christ has tasted death, and now righteousness is established in a Man who is competent to impart His Spirit to others.
Ques. What does Paul's expression, "My gospel" mean?
It is an enlargement; Paul gave an enlargement to the facts. What he preached was that Christ died for our sins and rose again. The gospel is all founded on the death and resurrection of Christ. What was preached even in the lifetime of Christ anticipated what was coming out in His death and resurrection.
{164}
THE WILL OF GOD
@Romans 12: 1 - 6
Rem. We thought we might take up the subject of the will of God in continuation of what we had before us last time. I suppose that the thought of the will of God takes us further than the gospel?
The will of God is more positive; it is the introduction of what is according to Himself; and it calls for the displacement of what does not answer to His mind, even of that which. He Himself ordained. Eden was established by divine appointment, and Adam was set over it, but he fell, and all that was displaced to make room for what is according to God. So we get, "He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second" @Hebrews 10: 9. He takes away even that which was of divine institution because it did not meet His mind. God brought in certain things in the course of His dealings with man which were not really according to His mind, and all those are displaced in order to make room for what is entirely according to Himself, and for His own pleasure. I suppose @Psalm 40 gives us the first definite idea of the will of God. "Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God".
Christ came to give place to all that is according to God, so that all may suit and answer to God's pleasure. We get it coming out in the ministry of the Lord; the cross is the foundation of it all, but the will of God indicates to me the idea of everything being ordered according to God's mind and pleasure. There must be a great difference between what must be when God is in the light of revelation compared with the time when He was hid.
Anyone can see what a difference has come in; a great many things could be tolerated when God was hid which could not be borne with now that He is in the light.
When God comes out in light, in the revelation of Himself;
{165}
all must be according to His pleasure. So the sacrificial system had to be taken away; christendom has tried to revert to it but it cannot have place now.
Ques. Had God ever any pleasure in the sacrificial system?
No, I do not think so; there was a certain typical teaching in it, but God had no pleasure in it -- "neither hadst pleasure therein". Now that He has come out in grace and love, all must be according to His pleasure.
The will of God is a very large thought, and it will not be completed until everything is made conformable to the pleasure of God. The application of the will of God to us is that we are set apart for priestly service; we are sanctified by the will of God. But then the will of God has its application to Israel, and even to the whole world; Christ came to be a light for the revelation of the gentiles, and the glory of His people Israel.
Rem. The will of God will be effected when God rests in His love.
I think so. We have to take into account that in the order of things which God has proposed to bring to pass, everything is to take its character from God; He will reconcile all things unto Himself: Things in this world have, to a large extent, taken their character from Satan.
Murder, lying, lust, pride and deceit are here; all this takes character from Satan. But in contrast to that, in the order of things which God purposes to bring to pass everything will take its character from Himself. That is the great contrast between the world that now is and the world to come. Christianity is in this world, and modifies things, but it has not altered the ruling principles of the world. There is a vast deal of murder which is not punishable by human law; every man that is greedy of gain is a murderer. "Every one that is greedy of gain ... taketh away the life of the owners thereof", @Proverbs 1: 19. A man enriches himself at the expense of others, and in that way takes away their life. The effect of christianity has been to bring in consideration for suffering and woe.
{166}
All the schemes for the alleviation of suffering which are abroad in the world today came in by christianity. They did not come through philosophy or science; I do not think there was anything of that kind among the Greeks or Romans. It is a well-known fact that the exposure of children among the Romans was of common occurrence.
Ques. How far has the will of God been already effected?
In principle everything is effected in Christ. Everything has to come forth from Christ; He is the one Source of everything that is according to God. He is the living Bread which came down from heaven to give life to the world. "By the which will we are sanctified" is the sense in which the will of God has been effected so far as we are concerned. We get in christianity in anticipation, all that is going to fill the universe of bliss; we have not to wait for the day of display. Life is not yet given to the world, but we get the good of the living bread today.
When God comes out in the revelation of Himself the necessary consequence is that all must take its character from Him. It is brought about in regard to us already; that is what comes out in the detail of this chapter; we are to take character from God. The effect of the glad tidings is to put us in relation to Christ as Head and as Lord, and therefore it brings us into an order of things which is virtually that of the world to come. We come into the good of the living bread by being brought into relation to the Head. We receive from Him living water -- His Spirit -- and we live by Him. "He that eateth me, even he shall live by me". When Christ becomes food to us there is no discontent or anything of that kind. "He that cometh to me shall never hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never thirst". That is the practical result of being placed in relation to Christ as Head, and the first principle of the gospel is to set us in relation to Christ as Head and Lord.
Ques. Why is the one body introduced here?
Because all takes its character from God now. This
{167}
world takes its character from Satan, but the new world will take its character from God. Now the first principle which is of God is *unity*. The thought of unity really takes its rise in God. You remember the prayer in @John 17, "That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me" verse 21. The great thought in the Old Testament was there is one God, but in the New we get that God is one, and the Mediator of God and men is one. The Father and the Son are one in the unity of the Spirit, and hence the first principle of christianity is unity; we get it pressed in every epistle. In the Old Testament what is insisted on is that there is *one* God in contrast to the multiplicity of heathen gods, but in the New Testament Persons are revealed in the Godhead, and it is now brought out that "God is one". There are three Persons, but there is no diversity of mind; the Father and the Son are perfectly one in mind and counsel, and the Spirit is spoken of as the Spirit of the Father and the Spirit of the Son. In counsel and thought and purpose in regard of all men "God is one". The revelation of God has brought to light the unity of the Godhead, and hence the first principle in regard of men is unity. So we get here (@Romans 12) that "we, being many, are one body in Christ". Then in Galatians, "Ye are all one in Christ Jesus" (@Galatians 3: 28); and in @1 Corinthians 12: 13, "For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit". Then in Ephesians, "There is one body and one Spirit" (4: 4); and in Colossians we get "the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God", 2: 19. We get the same principle in regard of Israel, "Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity" (@Psalm 133: 1); that will apply to Israel and Judah; they have been apart, but they are
{168}
to dwell together in unity. The principle of unity is to pervade the whole divine system because it is characteristic of the revelation of God. So in this chapter (@Romans 12) the first principle in connection with the will of God is that there is to be unity.
Ques. Does it say, "There is one mediator" because He is distinct?
There is not one Mediator for the Jew and another for the gentile; there is no longer a Mediator for the Jew only, but all the truth of God has come to light; God is fully revealed, and Christ is Mediator between God and *men*. Christ is distinguished because He has become Man, but that does not separate Him from the unity of the Godhead; it is still true, "I and my Father are one".
Ques. What is "the mystery of his will" in @Ephesians 1: 9?
The mystery of His will is to gather up all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and on earth. The will of God embraces all things, and all will be taken up in Christ. The church is the beginning of the will of God, but His will in the full extent of it is to gather up all things in the Christ. The will of God does not end with the church, though it begins there; the first element in the will of God is the church -- the sanctified and worshipping company -- but the will of God goes out to all things, and He has made known to the church the mystery of His will to head up all things in Christ.
Rem. I thought the mystery had more reference to the church.
I do not think so, for it goes on to say, "having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself, that in the dispensation of the fulness of times, he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him". The word "mystery" is often used in Scripture, but it is always qualified by what follows.
{169}
Ques. The heading up of all things was already revealed, then why is it spoken of as a mystery?
I do not think it is a mystery because it has no existence, but because it is not yet *made manifest*. When @Psalm 8 was indited it had no existence because Christ had not yet come, but now it has existence because Christ is there, but it is not yet manifest, and is therefore in mystery. You get hints of the kingdom in the Old Testament, but you could not speak of the mystery of the kingdom then; but now that Christ has come the kingdom has place, but because it is not yet manifest it is in mystery. All the will of God is *hid* in Christ and *pledged* in Christ, but the part of God's will which is being accomplished at the present time is the church, and that is in mystery because it is not yet *manifested*.
Ques. So the mystery of His will covers all?
Yes, I think so. It is not only that it is made known to us, but the thing exists. In Old Testament times the will of God was more or less indefinite, but now the Son has come, the One in whom all things are to be headed up and the mystery of God's will has a very definite place now.
Ques. What is the meaning of, "The mystery of God should be finished"? @Revelation 10: 7.
I think it means that all which God has been working out according to His will is finished, and everything has become manifest, so that it is no longer a mystery; it is the close of God's ways and dealings that is in view.
Rem. Then things which are in mystery began with Christ.
Yes, I think so, and not until Christ came. I doubt whether there was the existence of anything according to God's will until Christ came; all that God was doing in Old Testament times was in view of Christ. There was no real point of departure until Christ came; He was the beginning of the new order of things which is for God. But things are not yet become manifest; even Christ is hid; when He is manifested there will be no more
{170}
mysteries. The Spirit of God makes mysteries manifest to faith, and we ought to be in the intelligence of them.
We ought to be consciously in that system and order of things by which God means to supersede everything that exists. God will have a say in this world yet, but at the present time the gospel is the only thing that God has to say to this world, and the purpose of the gospel is to deliver people out of the world, and to bring them into the system of which Christ is Head. The gospel effects our translation from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of the Son of His love.
Ques. Why does it speak of being "transformed" before the will of God is mentioned? @Romans 12: 2.
We must be transformed in mind in order to take in the thought of the will of God. The natural mind cannot take it in, not even the greatest human intelligence; it is absolute foolishness to the natural man to speak of establishing an order of things which is entirely according to God, and which is to supersede the existing order, he cannot conceive it.
Ques. What is the mystery of iniquity?
It is the mystery of lawlessness; it is not manifested; people do not care to proclaim themselves as lawless, but we know that this principle is at work, and that it characterises the general state of things today.
Ques. Is it the will of God that we are to be conformed to Christ now?
Yes, we are to be so impressed by the revelation of God that the character of God comes out in us now, so that we become practically the children of God, shining as lights in the world, and holding forth the word of life. We get the detail of the will of God in this chapter (@Romans 12), and all that comes out is really the character of God; it is all according to what Christ was down here. The first great thing is to think soberly of oneself; 'I' should have no place in my own thoughts. Then love is to be without dissimulation, evil is to be abhorred, and we are to cleave to what is good; then at the close of the
{171}
chapter we are not to be overcome of evil, but to overcome in the power of good. It is the character of God coming out in the saints.
We touch the will of God by being attached to Christ; *we* cannot accomplish the will of God; it is by being attached to Christ that the will of God is effectuated in us. If the will of God comes out in us it is really by Christ; we are married to Another that we may bring forth fruit unto God. Two things come out in the early part of this epistle: first, we are brought to Christ as Lord, and are brought into the kingdom in that way; and second, we are attached to Him as Head. The latter part of the epistle rests on these two things. He is Lord to us, and we are brought to Him as Head, that we may take character from Him, and we get the consequences of this in chapter 12. Taking things practically, we cannot do anything except as under Christ the Lord; no man is free from the power of evil save as being under the Lord. We can only stand against evil as being strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. Salvation depends upon the fact that there is One who has power and authority completely superior to all evil. It is in the knowledge of the power that is in Christ that I come into the enjoyment of salvation. Then again we have no divine character save as we derive from Christ as Head.
Ques. Do we get power then connected with the Lord, and life with the Head?
Yes, life is connected with Christ as Head.
The will of God is to substitute one order of things for another, and our deliverance from this present evil world is included in that will. @Galatians 1: 4.
Ques. What are the mercies of God?
A man is so affected by the presentation of all that is of God, that he is content to be here for God's will. The ground covered in this epistle is very large; the first eight chapters bring in the church, then in chapters 9, 10 and 11 we get the restoration of Israel, and their reception is life from the dead for the nations.
{172}
Rem. But we do not get the thought of mercy until the end.
No, it follows on the close of the eleventh chapter, for in chapters 9, 10 and 11 we get the mercies of God exemplified in a remarkable way; sovereignty is brought in, and we get the compassions of God.
Ques. What is the thought in "a living sacrifice"?
A sacrifice is a thing devoted, and that cannot be recalled; that is to be true of the believer's body. The proper moral consequence of all that has been unfolded in the epistle is that you present your body as a vessel for the will of God. The body is to be, not a vessel for the flesh, not for my pleasure, but for God's pleasure, and that in which the will of God is set forth.
The compassions of God take in the whole range of God's dealings with men, both with Israel and the nations, and if we are affected by them the proper consequence is that we present our bodies to God as vessels for His will. If we do so it raises many questions; what are you going to do with your body? What use are you going to make of your tongue? It raises the whole question of what you are going to use your body for.
Rem. There is a good deal of talk about consecration in certain quarters at the present time.
That is because they have not presented their bodies to God; a man who has done it does not talk much about it. The Spirit would not lead a man to talk about it very much, nor to hold meetings to discuss it.
One great principle in God's ways is the principle of recovery; He delights in recovery. "It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found" @Luke 15: 32. That principle runs through all the ways of God; the church, in a certain sense, is recovery; so, too, Israel and the nations, and yet everything is morally new, because everything is of Christ.
I think few people really apprehend the will of God in the wide extent of it; they look at it in connection with
{173}
the details of their course down here. We need a sober judgment in regard to the details of life, and we have to remember that many things are sent to test us. I do not doubt that the will of God will greatly affect me in the details of life, but that will is connected with all that which He has established in Christ -- all that of which Christ is the beginning, and centre, and Head. Details down here test us, and bring out what we are about, and show what governs us, but I think we are left to judge as to our course down here. I do not think that God has any particular will as to whether I live in Peckham or in Greenwich. The great thing is, what governs you? If you are governed by the will of God, and you find yourself in circumstances which require a judgment, you will judge right. We should be governed by principles; in mind and spirit we have to be here absolutely for what is of God and His testimony. In regard of the detail of life we have to be guided by the Spirit; the Spirit will keep *me* right, and then I shall *do* what is right. What people regard as providential guidance very often deceives them; and those who speak much about guidance are often in bondage, and are mistaken in the end. It is in the detail of life that we are found out as to what line we are on. I have been tested myself in that way many a time. There are many things which are perfectly lawful, but the question is, are they expedient? If the affections are rightly directed the details of life will all find their place in reference to the will of God. That will is very simple; it takes in all that which it is His purpose to effect in Christ.
Ques. What does James mean by "If the Lord will"?
It comes in to test your spirit; are you free in spirit, and in dependence? It is the spirit in which you take up things here. The christian does not do things independently. Christ is our Lord, and what we do, we do to the Lord; He expresses to us the authority of God. You might do the lowliest thing to the Lord; a housemaid
{174}
may sweep a room to the Lord.
The first thing is to get an apprehension of the scope of the will of God. We are led into it by divine teaching and it all hangs on God's revelation of Himself. God having come out to reveal Himself there must be a universe that takes its character from Him. Our part in it is that we are a sanctified and worshipping company on the one hand, and on the other a vessel of testimony for God's will here. That is the will of God for us. In a coming day the earth will be completely controlled by the will of God; His will will be done on earth as in heaven; all will be established in the light of God. In @Genesis 1 there is light on the first day, and then the sun on the fourth day, and then the ordering of the whole sphere, and so it is in the moral universe. The Sun of righteousness is set in the heavens, and everything placed in relation to Him.
{175}
THE WORLD TO COME
@Hebrews 2: 5 - 9
We get two great thoughts in the epistle to the Hebrews; the first is the Israel of God, and the second is the service of God; and both are essential elements of the world to come. Divine thoughts in relation to the earth are connected with Israel, and hence if we get the establishment of divine thoughts, it is in connection with the Israel of God. In the first part of the epistle we get the Israel of God, and from the seventh chapter onwards we get the service of God. But there must first be the Israel of God if there is to be the service of God. The Israel of God today are the companions of Christ, those of whom He says, "Behold I and the children which God hath given me".
The thoughts of God are identified with the Israel of God. In chapter 1 there is the throne of God; in chapter 2 the Apostle and High Priest; in chapter 3 the house of God; and in chapter 4 the rest of God, and all these thoughts are identified with the Israel of God.
Ques. Would the expression "the Israel of God" in Galatians suggest the same idea?
Yes; the Israel of God is in contrast with the spurious Israel; the companions of Christ who form the house of God are the true Israel. We have the light of the world to come today because all is established in connection with the Israel of God. David's throne was God's throne; then the apostle and high priest take up the thought of Moses and Aaron; then the house of God and the rest of God were connected with Israel, and when we get the Israel of God we get all these divine thoughts established, and in that way we anticipate the age to come. There is a little difference between the thought of the world to come and that of the age to come. The world to come means the habitable earth to come, but
{176}
the age to come is in contrast to the present age. The world to come gives the idea of the sphere, and the age to come the moral character. In the world to come there will be the establishment of every divine thought, but then we have these things all established now in Christ and His companions -- the true Israel. Very much that we find in scripture is really anticipative; we enter anticipatively, as having the Spirit, upon many things which strictly belong to the world to come. If we get hold of the thought that christians are the companions of Christ, it lets in a great deal of light, and we see how we can anticipate the world to come.
Ques. Will you say something as to the service of God?
Well the first thing is to apprehend that the conditions of the service of God are completely changed by the fact of the change of priest. One important point in regard to the priest now is that all the propitiatory work is over; the priesthood is founded on the fact that there is no more offering for sin. The priesthood is entirely changed, and on the other hand the disposition of God is made known, and therefore the whole conditions of the service of God are changed. Priesthood in the past was connected with offerings for sin, and the disposition of God was not known, but now all is completely altered. God Himself is declared, His disposition is made known, and with the change of priest everything is changed. The priest subsists although the propitiatory work is all done, and now we have the new covenant, and the will of God established in Christ. We commemorate in the Lord's supper that the propitiatory work is all over on the one hand, and on the other the disposition of God is made known to us. The mind of God has been completely met in Christ; God has been glorified in Christ in regard of everything.
The service of God is worship, but if we do not apprehend the changed conditions we cannot approach God or serve Him according to His mind. The introduction of
{177}
a priest after the order of Melchisedec changes the whole character of the service of God. The Aaronic priesthood is set aside; the propitiatory work is all accomplished, and the disposition of God is declared.
Ques. What is the connection between the throne of grace and the world to come?
The throne of grace is characteristic of the world to come. God's throne is established in Christ; "Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever". The Psalms often speak of the throne, and God's throne and kingdom are established in Christ; we have the light of the throne in Christ; it is not yet displayed, but it is established in Christ.
Rem. It is a throne of *grace*.
Yes. Grace and righteousness are not opposed principles; grace reigns through righteousness. The heavenly city is the seat of the kingdom; grace is identified with the city, and the throne of God is there, but all is connected with Christ; He will take up the throne and the kingdom with His saints. But we have not to wait for the day of display; it is true for God and for us that His throne is established in Christ. We have both the kingdom and the city in Christ.
Then in the second chapter we have the Apostle and High Priest -- the true Moses and Aaron. Moses and Aaron were connected with Israel, and not with any other people, just as the throne was connected with David. Now Christ is both Apostle and High Priest, and the children whom God has given Him are the true Israel. Israel was God's house, but we are God's house now, and the companions of Christ. The Israel referred to in chapter 4 could not enter into rest, but we who believe do enter into rest.
Ques. What is the thought in "companions of Christ"?
It is those who share in His rejection who are looked at as His companions. "He came unto his own, and his own received him not. But as many as received him, to
{178}
them gave he power to become the sons (children) of God, even to them that believe on his name". Those who believe on His name come into the place of His companions.
Ques. Is the thought in this chapter that we enter already into rest?
It does not raise the question exactly of whether it is present or future, but it is we who believe who enter into rest. This point is to see that there is a circle where every divine thought can be made good, that is in the circle of Christ and His companions. "Behold I and the children which God hath given me", refers to those who are companions of Christ in His rejection. The disciples were in that place, and we come into it now; it is a place of great blessing and favour. It is the true Israel of God, and God's thoughts are made good there.
The importance of the house of God is that there we come under the influence of God; God dwelt among Israel that they might be under His influence. We are formed by coming under the influence of God as being His house.
All the mind of God is communicated by the Apostle, and He is the One who inaugurates God's system of blessing. The "great salvation" began to be spoken by the Lord as the Apostle; then at the end of chapter 2 we see Him as the High Priest.
The universe of bliss is dependent upon the Sun of righteousness arising with healing in His wings; He is the centre and bond of the universe of bliss. The heavens will speak to the earth, and the earth will respond to the heavens; the heavens will speak to the earth in the heavenly city, and communion will be established between the heavens and the earth. The earth will learn the surpassing riches of God's grace in the heavenly city, and will respond to it. God will "shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus" @Ephesians 2: 7. The nations will walk in the light of the city.
{179}
Ques. What is "the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints"? @Ephesians 1: 18.
All that which God takes up in virtue of redemption constitutes His inheritance; it is all that into which the church comes; God takes it up in the saints.
It is a point of great interest to me to see where Israel is at the present time; the line of promise is continued in the saints today. It is very important, because it is in the Israel of God that His mind is established. The apostle and high priest, and the house of God, and the rest of God are all in connection with a people. There is a people to whom these things have application, and they constitute the Israel of God.
Ques. Does the expression "the Israel of God" occur more than once in Scripture?
No; but the value of it, to my mind, is that it suggests that every divine thought is established at the present time; we have not to wait for the millennium; all God's thoughts are established now in Christ and in the Israel of God.
Ques. How do you connect the thought of the rest with Israel?
The idea of entering into rest came out in connection with the calling of Israel.
Ques. Why does the word of God being "quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword" come in?
Because what is superficial has to be cut away. We have to distinguish between what is external and the real thing. People are addressed in this epistle on the ground of their profession, but all through there is the recognition of the real thing which lies under the profession. Profession and the real thing are not necessarily commensurate.
The companions of Christ are those who cleave to Christ in the time of His rejection. The godly remnant of Israel was brought into the church, and the true Israel is there.
{180}
Ques. Is there not the same thought in @Romans 2: 28, 29?
Quite so; we get there the true Israel and the true circumcision.
Rem. And then the apostle goes on to show how the gentile can come in on the same ground.
Yes; God can establish all His thoughts now. We do not need to wait for the world to come, for it is anticipated in connection with Christ and His companions. The things which are now anticipated by faith will be displayed in the world to come, but the point for us is that in the Israel of God we get the light of the world to come *now*. Christendom does not understand fellowship in Christ's death and rejection here, and therefore knows nothing of a heavenly Christ, nor of the world to come; people are well content with the world as it is. If christians were in the light of Christ and the world to come they would entirely refuse *this* world.
Rem. Then we should be as distinct morally as Israel was nationally.
Exactly. Christianity has been adapted to the world as it is; it has become a great mustard tree.
Ques. Is it not well to see the distinction between the King and the Lord?
Yes. Christ is not exactly King now, because that title involves the kingdom being manifest, but we own Him as Lord. Then Christ is the Head of all principality and power; it may not be very apparent yet, but it is so. Christ has authority and power which is superior to the power of Satan; the name of the Lord is a strong tower, the righteous runneth into it and is safe. For deliverance, and safety and strength we must stand in the power of the Lord; we should be overcome by the power of evil were it not for the power and strength of the Lord.
Ques. What distinction is there between the thought of the Lord and the thought of the priest as we get it in the first part of Hebrews?
Christ as Lord is on the side of God; it is grace to us,
{181}
but it is power and authority on our behalf. But the priest is on *our* side; He is sympathetic; He intercedes for us and succours us. We cannot separate the two thoughts, for it is the One in whom all the power and authority of God are expressed in grace who alone can intercede for His people. The two things must go together. The Shepherd is the leader of the sheep; it is not so much the idea of power and authority; it is more connected with the priest.
We might now pass on to the latter part of the epistle, to consider the service of God. The whole christian system depends upon Christ being Priest; all hangs upon the One who can appear before the face of God for us. Man would be incapable of approaching God but for the Priest, and that Priest must be Himself a divine Person. In the question of approach all must hang upon the Priest; it was so in Judaism. Now the Son is constituted Priest to bring in the intelligent service of God. The One who is Priest is the One who has declared God, and now He is the One to lead in approach to God. Aaron could only worship according to certain conditions which were laid down, he could not inaugurate intelligent service. But now we can worship intelligently because we approach God by the One who has declared God.
Rem. There is response on our part to the revelation. Yes. The man who knows God best is most capable of approaching God. The One who now leads us to approach God is the One who perfectly knew and declared God. The Leader must be Christ; He not only sings praise to God in the midst of the church, but in the midst of the great congregation also; He must be the Leader of praise in every circle, or there could not be liberty and access. The only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared God, and now He sings praise to God. He is the most suitable One to do so.
The change of priest changes the whole conditions in regard to approach. The mind of God is completely met
{182}
in regard to all that dishonoured Him; man in the flesh is removed, and God is declared; and this changes all the conditions of the service of God. Christ gives character to the praise of every circle, whether the church, or Israel, or the nations.
Ques. Why is Christ called the Mediator of the new covenant?
Because He has declared the disposition of God; He entered into death not only that God might be met sacrificially in regard to all that dishonoured Him, but in order that the love of God might be declared. In the Supper Christ is before us as the Mediator of the new covenant, but then we go on to appreciate Him as the Minister of the sanctuary.
Rem. It is a point of the last moment that we should rightly apprehend the import of the Supper.
Indeed it is; the great object of the Lord in the Supper is to put us in touch with Himself and with one another, and then we are prepared to be led in by Him as the Minister of the sanctuary.
Ques. When you speak of God being met sacrificially do you mean that there was something due to God?
Yes, amends had to be made to God, and all amends were made in the death of Christ, but then at the same time His disposition was declared. There can be no more offering, for all amends have been made to God, and the believer has a perfect conscience; on the other hand, the disposition of God has been declared. These things are the foundation of worship and service, and they will hold good for Israel as well as for us.
Ques. Is the man removed for Israel?
Yes, or otherwise they could not have the law written in their hearts. The lawless man has been removed in Christ, and they will partake in Christ, and come under the Spirit of Christ, and have the law written in their hearts. The nations, too, will come under the influence of Christ and of His Spirit. The worship of Israel will depend upon their knowledge of God. We have a
{183}
wonderful opportunity at the present time, for we are brought into intimate relationship with God, and the Spirit is here to form us according to God; we have extraordinary privilege. We are privileged to enter into the holiest, where we can learn all the secrets of God before those secrets are made manifest. It is a wonderful, but solemn, privilege.
Ques. Is the thought of the great priest over God's house the same as the minister of the sanctuary?
Not quite, to my mind; I think it indicates the place of Christ in regard to the universe of bliss; He has the ordering of everything.
The first thing to apprehend in this epistle is the true Israel, and that every thought of God subsists there; then we see next that the change of priest alters all the conditions of divine service; all now takes its character from what has come in in connection with Christ; the two great points are that the propitiatory work is over, all amends have been made to God, and, on the other hand, the disposition of God is declared.
The first tabernacle, "wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread", has no standing today.
Those things refer to the public relations of Christ with Israel which will have place in the coming age. Every thread of divine purpose has been gathered up in Christ and is maintained in the church, and will be displayed in glory.
Ques. What does it mean to enter the holiest?
It is entering intelligently into the secret of God's purposes in Christ; when you come into the holiest, you come into the presence of the ark of the covenant and the mercy-seat.
Rem. When we are there we have entered into rest.
Yes. Entering into rest is entirely dependent upon our condition; when our condition is entirely according to God, we enter into rest.
Ques. Is not that true when we enter into the holiest?
Yes; we are there in virtue of the work of God
{184}
simply; all the contrary part has been removed in the death of Christ.
Ques. What is the thought in the mediator?
The mediator bridges the distance between God and men, but here the thought is more limited, He is the Mediator of the new covenant to a people already in relationship with God. The new covenant will be established with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah that all the world may get the benefit of it. Whatever is established in the heavenly city is for the good of Israel, and what is for the good of Israel will be for the good of the whole earth. The earth will be in the light of the heavenly city.
When we are established in the knowledge of God's disposition towards us, we approach Him. Righteousness and love are the terms of the new covenant. God has a right to the supreme place in the affections of every intelligent being, but it is equally within the rights of God to remove every lawless man, and that is what has been effected in the death of Christ. God gets His proper place in the heart of every intelligent creature by the Spirit of Christ, and perfect love casteth out fear.
Ques. What is the difference between the holiest and the Father's house?
The holiest is a moral idea; the Father's house is a place.

LANDMARKS OF GRACE IN LUKE'S GOSPEL
(1) @Luke 7: 31 - 50
I want to bring before you the *passage* which the soul has to take in the things of God. It is a moral and spiritual passage, and therefore not what can be seen; yet it is very real. It may be spoken of in different ways; it may be spoken of as the passage from the world to the Father, from Adam to Christ, or from the flesh to the Spirit. It may be looked at in these different ways -- as from the world, Adam, or the flesh; but these are all bound up together as one; as also the Father, Christ, and the Spirit. Faith may *apprehend* God's mind, but cannot go beyond that. People remain where they are, but for progress the passage must be taken, and the point in christianity is, that the passage may be taken *now*. It is a passage, as I have said, which the soul takes from the world to the Father; from Adam to Christ; and from the flesh to the Spirit. I want to take up a few important landmarks which will help to show how this passage *is* taken.
You get one in this chapter, also another in chapter 10, the parable of the good Samaritan; and another in chapter 15, the parable of the prodigal; and lastly in the thief on the cross you get the climax. Each one of them presents what is completely new for man: that which had nothing to say to what man was as God created him. A prophet of a new order has arisen. The Prophet here is Christ Himself -- the Truth. No prophet in old times ever pretended to be the truth; they expressed it so far as moved by the Spirit of God, and they might have been in accord with their prophecies; but we get here, and in @John 4, a Prophet who Himself is the Truth, and for that reason He becomes the standard of everything. The truth must be the standard. The world is artificial and goes on by appearances; if it were divested of appearances the effect would be you could not live in it; it would be intolerable
{186}
if it were all naked and revealed as it is, it would be like hell. Here we get the Prophet, who is *the Truth*, and when you get the truth absolutely, you get a standard for everything. In chapter 10, the Lord comes out as a new neighbour. The law could not assist. A neighbour is an expression of *grace*. In chapter 7, it is more *truth*. In chapter 15, man finds a new *home* in the knowledge of the Father, -- all is new; and in the thief on the cross you get new companionship.
These two incidents and two parables show that you are brought into the presence of all that is *new*, and the new things are intended to act upon us so that our souls may take this passage. I have indicated briefly that christianity refers to the present, and the passage of which I have been speaking is a transition which is to be taken now, i.e., from Adam to Christ, from the world to the Father, from the flesh to the Spirit.
Tonight I want to speak of the apprehension of Christ as *the truth*. Wisdom and truth are very intimately connected; but until man finds truth, he can never find a pathway here, see verses 28, 30, 35. "Wisdom is justified of all her children" -- wisdom is here; it comes out all through the incident which follows. Christ was wisdom; He is the wisdom of God, and wisdom is here. Wisdom is the resource of God when all has failed on the part of man. In every crisis you find the resource of God coming in; in no sense is God baffled. You see it at the beginning. When sin came in, you get the seed of the woman brought in who was to bruise the serpent's head. Then again at Babel; when God scattered the people, you find He had a resource; in Abraham's seed all the nations of the earth were to be blessed. Then again, when man crucified Christ, God raised Him from the dead; all failed on the part of man. John the baptist had come in the way of righteousness, and they did not care for him; the Son of man came in the way of grace, and they said, "Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber". In whatever way God sees fit to present Himself to man, it will evoke no
{187}
response on the part of man; appeals to repentance, as in John the baptist, or a ministry of grace in the Lord Himself; evoked nothing; the case of man is hopeless, nothing is to be expected, and therefore God sets aside man and brings in His resource.
Now there are the children of wisdom; the Pharisees and lawyers were not wisdom's children, nor was Simon. Wisdom's children discern the truth. Simon was lacking in discernment; he misjudged Christ and the woman; but on the other hand you get the woman proving herself as one of wisdom's children, for she discerned the truth -- the wisdom of God.
I want to say a word in regard to the truth. It comes out in the parable, see verses 40 - 42. The Lord speaks here in a parable, which unfolded the truth, but *He* was the truth. The woman in John said: "Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet". He *was* a prophet; but He was more; He was the truth; He was the expression of things as they are. Simon had the thought that Christ was a prophet; afterwards he began to doubt it, but he went no further. The Lord was more than a prophet; John the baptist was the greatest among prophets; and one now may have their loins girt about with truth, but that is not being *the* truth. The Spirit is the truth, and nothing else in the world, except what is the expression of the Spirit is truth. The Lord when here was the truth, so now the Spirit is the truth. When Christ was here, the truth of the moment was that He was here giving living water. Then He strips the woman of Samaria of appearances, for the truth was there -- God was there -- that was the peculiarity of the moment; God was there giving living water. So here in @Luke 7 you get what was peculiar to the moment; the creditor was there, but "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them" (@2 Corinthians 5: 19); hence He could be in the house of Simon and accept, too, the attention of the woman. If it had not been that He was not imputing trespasses, He would not have been there.
{188}
The truth for the moment was that God was here in grace. At the present time the Spirit is the *truth*, that is to bring man into correspondence with what is in heaven. What is expressed in the saints down here by the Spirit is the truth, and truth is substance, and truth finds its expression down here in what the Spirit has wrought in saints.
The great mistake that Simon made was that he judged according to appearances; to do so is a mistake. No one judges aright save as he gets into the sanctuary, then he comes to a sound judgment of things here, i.e., according to truth, according to the sanctuary.
The psalmist spoke of having been as a beast (so foolish was he in his judgment of things) -- unintelligent; but when he gets into the sanctuary, he sees things as they are, Simon judged according to appearances, and said the woman was a sinner. Simon did not apprehend that Christ was God revealed, but still God; that He was the truth, the expression of things as they were at that moment. The woman discerned things aright. The Lord discerned and exposed what was in Simon's heart; He discerned, too, that the woman was a child of wisdom, and the woman for that reason, i.e., being wisdom's child, discerned the truth. Christ discerned both Simon and the woman; Simon misjudged both Christ and the woman, but the woman discerned Christ, see verses 44 - 50. The woman discerned truth, that "God was in Christ, not imputing trespasses", and therefore she was prepared to accept at the hand of the Lord the forgiveness of sins. All arose from the fact that she was a child of wisdom, and discerned the truth; Simon did not discern that only Christ was the truth. The Jew was there with his religion, the Greek with his philosophy; but there was no truth in either. In Christ you get the expression of things as they were there and then. The woman, being a child of wisdom, was prepared to accept the forgiveness of sins. If we apprehended Christ as the One in whom God is revealed, it must attach us to the One in whom the
{189}
revelation is made -- in whom God is presented.
We see it in this woman; she is attached to the One in whom the revelation is made, the One in whom God was revealed. How could it be otherwise? If God has come close to us in grace, not imputing trespasses, not even calling attention to them, one could not but be attached to the One in whom the truth is set forth. What the Lord said to the woman was, "Thy faith hath saved thee". Do you think she went out without attachment to Christ? "She loved much".
You get the same in the woman of Samaria; she appreciated Christ, and went to the men of the city and said, "Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did".
Simon and all the world outside were in darkness, but the woman discerned the truth. Wisdom on the part of God is *resource*; for the christian wisdom is a *way*, and so there was a way for this woman. The Lord said, "*Go in peace*"; but I do not believe she was far from Christ in spirit. There is a way for the children of wisdom down here, and that way is the will of God. How are you going to take that way? It is brought about by the practical appreciation of Christ. All depends on what the heart is governed by. If my heart is simply governed by my principles I shall be turned aside from the way; all depends for us upon the *heart* being governed by Christ. Christ is made wisdom to us, so that we may have a way down here. Christ is made to us wisdom; Christ, too, is made righteousness to us. He is sanctification also; He is redemption too. Christ is *all* to us. He is at the right hand of God, and we are set apart to Him; we are sanctified for the service of God as vessels for the Master's use; but the moment He is in movement He will be redemption for us. All hangs for us upon our appreciation of Christ. This woman loved much, and I have no doubt she found her way through this world. The Lord did not always keep people about Him; the demoniac wanted to be with Him, but the word of
{190}
Christ to him was, "Return to thine own house", etc. But as absent from Him He holds us in the way by the principle of attraction -- the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus. Nothing could be more important than that we should take the passage from Adam to Christ. Christ is going to fill all things, and if He is great enough to fill all things morally for God, do you not think He is great enough to fill you and me? It is in the appreciation of Christ that we make the passage from Adam to Christ. He is the righteous One, and the Holy One, and He is eternal life. He is *all* and in all.
The woman had a path a million times better than Simon's. Simon had *no* way, he had no attachment to Christ; he was not one of wisdom's children, and therefore he had no way. It is a great thing if God works in a man, and thus instead of walking in a vain show and disquieting himself, he appreciates the truth of what God is. God has come out in love. The creditor is here and not imputing trespasses. When we apprehend this grace it is what forms us according to truth, and we find a way here. "I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment: that I may cause those that love me to inherit substance". May the Lord lead us into the appreciation of Christ, not only as a Prophet, but as a Prophet of a new order, and who is the *truth*, the expression of things as they are on the part of God.
There are only two Persons spoken of as the truth. At the present time the Spirit is the *truth*. If saints have the love of God shed abroad in their hearts, and live in the light of divine love, they become the witness here; the Spirit in that way is the truth.
(2) @Luke 10: 23 - 42
I gave an idea last week of the line that was before me in connection with the gospel of Luke. We spoke of chapter 7, and I tried to bring out what was found by the "woman in the city, which was a sinner". Now we come to a
{191}
parable with which we are all familiar. The question is, What did the "man who fell among thieves" find in the Good Samaritan? The answer is, He found a neighbour. The woman of the city found wisdom, and the man who fell among thieves found a neighbour. The prodigal in chapter 15, found a home, and the thief on the cross found company -- he was to go to paradise in company with the Lord. The four cases together, all typical cases (typical in the sense that they are representatives of a class), make a remarkable company. A woman of the city; a man who fell among thieves; a prodigal; and then a thief; they are a motley company, and the question might be asked, How are they going to get on together? After the flesh there could be no peace between them, they were such an incongruous company; yet this problem is solved in that Christ is their peace; it *is*, therefore, possible for them to get on together. The solution of the difficulty is that there is the exclusion of man after the *flesh*; Christ has come in and He is our peace. If we are each characterised by Christ we shall not find it difficult to go on together, because the principle is, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good", @Romans 12: 21. Once you get started on that line there is no difficulty in getting on together. The woman of the city found wisdom, and she proved the value of wisdom in finding a path of righteousness.
Now I want to come to the effect offending a neighbour. The point in connection with the woman of @Luke 7 is, that she was a child of wisdom, and, as a result, she finds a way -- a sinful woman finds a way. Simon did not find one; people, too, who it may be are intelligent in this world, are yet in darkness, and have no way. It is poor work to make research and not, as a result, to find a way.
In the way of righteousness peace is to be found; there is no peace to the wicked. If we have on the breastplate of righteousness, we have, too, our feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace. I can bless God very abundantly for having enabled me to find a path, and
{192}
that Christ has been made to me "wisdom and righteousness". Piety has promise of the life that *now is*. It is better to have peace than to have all the riches of the world.
The neighbour is concerned about our state, not about our finding a way. It is important to distinguish the particular point in each. With the neighbour the point is, that he is concerned about our state, see verses 30 - 37. Notice particularly verse 34: "And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast", etc.; the man's state is vividly described; he was stripped of his raiment and wounded. All that the neighbour did was to have compassion on his state; it was not a question of finding a way, but of meeting the condition of the man. The priest and the levite had *no* compassion. The neighbour represents the Mediator, the Man Christ Jesus. There had been a mediator previously, but what marked Moses as a mediator was not compassion. He was the minister of the law. The priest and the levite were the continuation of the mediator. The mediator was taken up with the introduction of the system; but the priest and levite would maintain the system, but neither of them was marked by compassion. The truth is, they were unable to do anything for him.
Now the point of the passage is the transition from law to grace. The neighbour represents the Mediator; but if you want to understand Christ in that light, you must first understand the mediator of the previous system. All that the priest and the levite could do was to minister the letter and formality of the law; they had nothing to do with the spirit of it. People nowadays like formality and the letter, and they do not care about the spirit, and for this reason they do not like the knowledge of God. Man likes religion, but he wants it without the knowledge of God. But I ask -- What can be the value of religion without the knowledge of God? People want religion which is not distasteful to the natural man; but it is
{193}
religion without God, and that is not "pure religion"; it is vain, indeed offensive to the eye of God. Any religion not permeated with the knowledge of God must be but sounding brass.
The priest and the levite had the letter and the form; and they ministered both, but could not minister the spirit of the truth. Their ministry was defective because they could not tell you the secret which lay behind the law. The lawyer says, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thyself" @Luke 10: 27. He answered right. The lawyer was an expositor of the law, and the answer he gave was extremely good; he gave the principle of the ten commandments, but he could not give an answer as to the secret which lay underneath it. So the priest and the levite could not touch the man, because they were unacquainted with the secret which lay behind the law, see verses 33 - 36. We get the truth covered up in a parabolic way; the Lord concealed, as it were, the truth in that way; but the Spirit is here to give the exposition of the parable. The true Mediator, the Man of God's purpose, has come to light. "There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus" @1 Timothy 2: 5. The law was not the exposition of the heart of God to man, and the priest and levite could not discern it, and it did not make known to them the great secret of the love of God. The Mediator has come out, and made known that the secret which lay behind the law was the love of God. The right of God is to claim the affections of every man, and such commands as "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart", which were given specifically to Israel, still in principle apply to all men, and not merely to the Jew, assert this right. The truth has now come out that God loved man, that "God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son" @John 3: 16. That "the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared" @Titus 3: 4. It is the revelation
{194}
of God in Christ, in all His love and compassion, that bows the heart of man to God. The law was ineffective to this end, and if men are bowed now, it is by the light of the revelation of God which has come out in Christ. The wonderful thing is, a *Man* has come, and that on the part of God. He is really the Son of God, but He is a Man come in compassion to men, and to where man was. You can recall what marked the Lord when here, He was full of compassion; men claimed His compassion, and they had His compassion. "Came where he was" means that the Son of God came down to *death*, where man was; He comes in testimony into the place of death to bring to light the love of God, death being annulled for man, so that man might live in the love which was revealed in the death of Christ.
"Pouring in oil and wine", that is, the making known, not demand, but the *secret* of the demand, which is the love of God. Why should God command man to love Him with all his heart? Now the love has come to light: "God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life". The secret of the law has come to light in the death of Christ, and that is the testimony that bows man to God. The death of Christ is the great declaration of divine love, and if people are not affected by that, they are incapable of being moved by anything. God Himself, in the Person of Christ, has come into the place of man's distance, that man may live in the love of God. God has no further testimony to address to man, beyond the death of Christ; Christ came here that He might make known the secret of the law. He Himself bore the curse, and was hanged on a tree; but the object of it was not simply that the curse might be borne, but that the great secret of the law might be brought to light. Christ gave Himself a ransom for all, to make known the love of God; it is the pouring in of the wine and oil, which, in the service of the Mediator, makes known the love of God, which affects man's state. It is the testimony of
{195}
divine love which forms us in divine love; it could not be apart from the Spirit, but it is by that testimony that the Spirit of God works.
The new man is created after God, but he is created by the testimony of God, and by divine love affecting us in our moral being. It is only as we are made effectually acquainted with the love of God, which is declared in the death of Christ, that we are formed after God. Then he sets him on his own beast. He sets him on that which was peculiarly his own, not borrowed. It is a new spring for man; we are carried by a power which is peculiar to the Spirit of God. It may be an allusion to the Spirit as the Spirit of life; but the point is, we are carried by a power which was peculiarly His *own*. "He brought him to an inn, and took care of him". An inn is not a hotel where you can have every luxury; it is a mere resting-place, and where you need to be taken care of. The whole passage is intended to convey what the neighbour concerns himself about, in regard to the man. The man was stripped, was naked and wounded. Man does not like his self-esteem stripped, nor does he like a death-blow struck at his pride. God brings man to the sense of all that, and take care that man shall be brought to this, and what such a one wants is a *new state*, and that is what the neighbour gives him. The work of God is to form a new state, and all the testimony presented to us in regard of God is presented in view of forming us in a new state. When a man is converted, he has not a word to say, he cannot mend himself, and all depends on what is presented to him. The ministry of the new covenant does not simply expound the terms of the new covenant, but these terms have to become effective in us by forming us by the testimony which is presented to us.
The secret of the law has come to light in the gospel, and when the secret has been apprehended we are enabled to comply with the righteous requirements of the law; they are fulfilled in us, "who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit". The object of it all is, that
{196}
the soul may be subdued in the presence of Christ. Mary had come under the influence of Christ, and she had been affected by the One who had come in as neighbour, and she was subdued in the presence of Christ.
I rejoice in the thought that Christ is wisdom to us, and that in that way there is a *way*, and that way is God's will; and so instead of being overcome by evil, I can overcome evil with good. But mark, the neighbour comes in, and makes known the love of God, so that we should be subdued in the presence of Christ, and sit at His feet and hear His word; and in that way we, like Mary, would not only do right things, but do them in the right way and in the right spirit.
May the Lord lead us to know what we have gained in Christ as a neighbour; the one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself a ransom for all.
(3) @Luke 15: 1 - 32
We have already had chapters 7 and 10, and this follows as a kind of sequence. There is a moral connection between them, and a kind of progress marked in them; the same ground is not covered twice in Scripture. You may get an incident (as for instance Saul's conversion) related more than once; but they are all presented in a different light, and two scriptures never cover the same ground.
So what we get here does not cover the same ground as what we get in chapters 7 and 10, although there is much in common between them, In chapter 7 it is wisdom -- wisdom which gives a way for man. Christ has come in, He is wisdom, and he who receives Christ is a child of wisdom, and the effect of that is, that we have a way and path down here -- I am not shut up. In chapter 10 you get the idea of *grace* presented: a neighbour comes in, and man finds a neighbour, and in doing so he gets support and care so long as he stands in need of care. In
{197}
chapter 15 we get another idea. What is prominent in this chapter is not the subjects of mercy, as in chapters 7 and 10 but we get the *One* who shows mercy. God has come out to act for His own pleasure and satisfaction, and man gets his blessing in that acting of God. In the beginning of the chapter you find the Lord vindicating Himself to His aggressors, who complained that He received sinners; they complained of the company in which Christ was found, and the parables which follow are a vindication of God in the course He was taking. We get the thought of the fulness of the Godhead in this chapter, and it is in Christ that that fulness is presented. The scribes and Pharisees complained that Christ was found in the company of sinners.
Why should men object to God showing mercy? They were not concerned at the possibility of Christ being contaminated; the point of their complaint was, that there was a recognition of publicans and sinners. If God was here, and He was taking account of sinners, it meant that He passed by the scribes and Pharisees. Now Christ could not be contaminated, He was holy; *we* should have been contaminated, but He, being the Holy One, could come into any company, but He was not contaminated by the company that He kept. He touched the leper, and the leper was healed. It showed how different Jesus was to any one else on earth; the scribes and the Pharisees did not trouble themselves on the score of His being contaminated. But what they *did* object to was that the publicans and sinners should be recognised; they were considered a kind of 'pariah', or outcasts, and after all it was a question of *God* seeing fit to eat with them. It was no question of the Pharisees, they had no right thought; their thought was not that amends were due to God, but the Lord indicated the course that God was pleased to take.
In no gospel do we get the thought of the fulness of God coming out, as in this gospel of Luke. I want to speak of one point; if there are amends due to God on
{198}
the part of man, He could see to that, and would see to it; but we must admit the right and prerogative of God to show mercy. He will seek for the lost sheep. We would all admit God's right to show mercy, and if God comes to show mercy, He expects to find those who stand in need of mercy; the scribes and the Pharisees were not on that ground, they had no need of mercy. If God came to show mercy, He did not come to them; He came on a mission of mercy, and the scribes and the Pharisees, therefore were not in accord with His mind, i.e., standing in need of mercy. He came and sought for those who stood in need of mercy. The publicans and sinners could not stand on the legal ground. It was only in them that you might expect to find repentance and what was in accord with God's mercy. God was here, and He was found to be in associations where there was a possibility of finding those who stood in need of mercy. The gospel comes in on the same ground. God presents Himself to man in grace, but until man is repentant, the gospel holds out nothing that men care for. Suppose an evangelist goes out to preach. What he preaches is for all, it is preached to every creature under heaven, and be looks to find those who are in accord with the mercy of God; the proud and self-righteous do not want mercy, therefore they have to be passed by. The evangelist has to look for repentance, because the self-righteous are not in accord with the attitude in which God presents Himself to man. The Lord vindicates the right of God to show mercy, if He sees *fit* to do so. Their zeal was not for the preservation of the spotlessness of Christ; they had no such thought.
Now I have said that much as to the chapter generally, indicating the course that God was taking in the presence of self-righteous men. He was light for every man, but He was of necessity looking for those who were in accord with the mind of God, i.e., repentant. The gospel is looking for repentance, because without that, man will not get the good of the gospel.
Now I turn to show what the prodigal found, verse 17,
{199}
and on. I shall trace in a few words his history, and it depicts and finds its echo in the experience of most christians. The first movement of the prodigal was repentance; we are not told how it was brought about, but "he came to himself". I do not think it was the need of the far country which brought him to that; the simple fact is, it was the beginning, and the goodness of the father came before him. How that might be brought home to a man I cannot tell; it may be in a dream, in a vision of the night, by chastening, or sickness; but the thought of goodness is brought home to a man, and the result is, "he came to himself", and in that way he is brought into accord with the mind of the father, and that mind was mercy. The Lord was bringing to light here that God was going to show mercy to the *gentile*. We get hints of it in Old Testament times. Nineveh was spared, having been brought to repentance by the testimony of God's forbearance. The prodigal was brought into accord with the father, as ready to show mercy. The next thing is, he comes back to the father, and he meets a welcome; he turns to God. The commission to the apostle Paul was that he was to go to the gentiles (we get here the prodigal, who was one of them): "Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me" (@Acts 26: 17, 18), and when the apostle carried out his commission, he preached that men should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance. The returning prodigal meets a welcome. A man who turns to God gets the sense of welcome in receiving forgiveness of sins.
The prodigal would have asked to remain on the ground of a humble servant, as not deserving anything. The point of the father is, that the prodigal was to *live* before him, and I have no doubt that prompted the thought of the clothing. He is to have the best robe, a
{200}
ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet, etc., so that he might *live* before the father. The allusion to Christ in this parable is hidden, but we get it, I think, in the robe. The robe is what *characterises*, and it means *Christ*, and *we* need that to *live* before the Father. When the gentiles were brought to God, they found a welcome and received forgiveness; but God's thought was not that the gentiles were to be here as reformed gentiles; He intended that they should *live by Christ*.
Christ has taken the position of a life-giving Spirit, and every one who *lives* for God does so in virtue of the living water which he receives from Christ. We cannot live save in the appreciation of divine love, and what was revealed of God in Christ, and in the death of Christ. If man is brought to God, in that way he derives from Christ, and *lives* to God. If man is going to live to God now, it must be in the appreciation of Christ who in grace came out from God that He might bring the light of God to us. Hence it is, "If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha" @1 Corinthians 16: 22.
Now I come to the portion of the prodigal. The father provided a portion which in no way touched the portion of the elder brother. The gentile was never on the ground of the Jew. "All that I have is thine", is what the father said to the elder brother; but the prodigal's portion was found in the knowledge of the father. God has set us before Him that we might live to Him, and it is only in the intimacy and knowledge of God and His love that we are capable of living to, worshipping, and serving the living and true God. It was the thought of the Father to bring our souls to a blessed place of rest, and that is only known as we know the Father, and know His love and what He will accomplish in us. The prodigal found rest; but the father found rest and satisfaction in what? -- in the result of his own work in the prodigal. He could see the best robe on the prodigal, and there was satisfaction. It was mutual satisfaction and mutual merriment: "Let *us* eat and be merry". The gentile has been so brought to
{201}
God that he may receive a welcome, and live in Christ, and live with God; and my life lies in the knowledge of divine goodness and love. It results in confidence and liberty with God; in the presence of love you can enjoy liberty. "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty" (@2 Corinthians 3: 17); but the father found his satisfaction in the prodigal, and that was in the fruit and result of his own work in the prodigal. One point more: all this was in the house -- in the father's house; the father found his satisfaction in the guest who had been brought into his house, in accord with his own mind. A man may have received forgiveness, but he cannot live on that; he may accept it, but if a man has to live, he must live in the knowledge of God's nature, and that is in virtue of having received living water from Christ. God has been brought to light in Christ, also all His blessed purposes of love, and that is the light which we are brought to, and in which we live. We are brought to the Father, and there is mutual merriment. This has been brought into the world for the gentiles, but it in no way interferes with the portion of the Jew, the elder brother, which God has reserved for him. He will be brought into it when he is brought into accord with the mind of God, which is sovereign mercy. How far are we in liberty, and in confidence in God, in the blessed sense of that into which we are brought as our own proper portion?
(4) @Luke 23: 32 - 43
We find that "wisdom is justified of all her children". This comes in, in a remarkable way, in connection with Christ being here; the publican and the harlot justified wisdom; they were baptized with the baptism of John. So too the thief here, who confessed Christ, justified wisdom. Wisdom is justified oft-times by very strange people. It was the darkest moment when Christ was on the cross, and yet it was a triumph of grace that the thief should at
{202}
that moment confess Him. What I shall speak of tonight follows in connection with what we have had before us on previous occasions. I have taken up certain landmarks in this gospel. The woman in @Luke 7 was one of wisdom's children, and she found righteousness. The Lord said to her, "Thy sins are forgiven", and as a result she found a way; this is a way of peace and a way outside the confusion which prevails in this world.
Passing on to chapter 10, the man who fell among thieves found a neighbour, he found support and grace so long as he needed it down here. Christ was man's neighbour, and He came down in mercy to act the neighbour to the man who fell among thieves. We have not lacked care nor support since we believed in Him; I think each christian would bear testimony to that experience. In chapter 15 the prodigal found a father, a portion, and a home; not so much righteousness, nor a way, nor a neighbour, but he got the revelation of the Father, which is love, and he found a portion, and in connection with the portion he found a home and a feast.
Now tonight we come to chapter 23. The thief was to be a companion of Christ in paradise; he had never been His companion on earth, save on the cross, but he was to be the companion of Christ in paradise. It was a moment of supreme darkness here, and yet God so wrought that not only did Christ go to paradise, but the poor thief went also. The dealings of God are all on the same principle; we may not come to such a position as that in which the thief found himself; we may have been restrained from gross evils, yet we are privy to what the thief was. I know I am privy to violence if I were excited, and had the power to exercise it; there is that in me which answers to every evil you hear perpetrated. I should attach great value to restraints by teaching and government and training, but everyone's heart is capable of every possible kind of evil. We get the vindication of the Lord, and that on the part of a very unlikely person -- one of the thieves. The thief apprehended Christ as the Righteous
{203}
One: "This man hath done nothing amiss" -- he apprehended Him as entirely singular and exceptional; "we indeed justly" -- he apprehended Christ as the Righteous One, and this is very important. Then he says to Him, "Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom", see chapter 19: 12. "A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself, a kingdom, and to return"; the thought of this seems present in the mind of the thief: he says "remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom". He apprehended that a kingdom belonged to Christ; if he had not apprehended Him as the Righteous One, he could not have said what he did: "When thou comest into thy kingdom". For the moment Christ had no kingdom; He was hanging on a tree; He was made a curse; but the thief was in the light of the moment; it was evident that divine light had shone into his soul. I cannot tell you *how* the testimony reached him; I cannot tell *how* he was enlightened, and enlightened more than anyone else upon earth at that moment; he was in advance of everybody else. The Lord was leaving the world to receive a kingdom and to return. The thief was not only born again, but he was illuminated; and I go a point further; he had in his heart received the kingdom; he saw there was a moment coming when Christ would assert Himself (for that is the kingdom), and the thief had received it in his soul. The kingdom had its own place in the heart of the thief, and the work of God in man is, that he may apprehend the kingdom of God, and receive it; that is, to accept the domination of grace.
In accepting God's testimony a man submits to the rule and reign of grace; in principle this was true in regard to the thief, and the evidence is, he says, "Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom". I refer to chapter 12: 31, 32, 35, 36: "But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you. Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.... Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; and ye yourselves like unto men
{204}
that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately".
I refer to that passage for this principle. We receive the kingdom in testimony; it is the subject of preaching, but on the other hand it is the Father's good pleasure to give us the kingdom. The kingdom means righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. It is the sway of grace in the heart of the believer; but if we have received the kingdom, we know that it is the Father's good pleasure to give us the kingdom. We have now the grace of the kingdom, by and by we shall be in the glory of it; we shall have part with Christ in the glory of the kingdom Hence we get, "Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord ... that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately". The coming of the Lord is to bring us into the glory of the kingdom; when Christ reigns we shall reign with Him, and meanwhile we are waiting with Him. The thief did not really know what was involved for him to have received the kingdom; but it meant that he would have part in the glory of it with Christ. If we know anything about the grace of the kingdom established in our hearts, we shall most certainly have part in the glory of the kingdom.
It is a most important exhortation, and we should be looking to it that we have our loins girded, and our lights burning, and to be like unto men who wait for their Lord, that they may open to Him immediately. We want to keep clear of every influence which tends to entangle us here, so that when the Lord comes and knocks we may open to Him immediately; then our part will be glory with Christ in the kingdom. But all that has not come to pass yet: the glory of the kingdom waits; Christ is not yet reigning. God has said to Him, "Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool" (@Psalm 110: 1); but what fills the interval? -- "Today shalt thou be with me in paradise".
{205}
The thief was right in his thought that Christ would come in His kingdom; but the Lord makes known to him what would fill the interval: "*Today* shalt thou be with me in paradise", i.e., he was to be a companion of Christ in paradise. It was not wonderful for Christ to go to paradise, and for this reason: that He could go to the cross. "He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things" @Ephesians 4: 10. Then again, "He humbled himself; and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name" The place of Christ above is the proper moral answer to the place He took here; He proved Himself morally suitable for going to the highest place in heaven. His going to the cross proved that a perfect righteousness was fulfilled here. On the ground of law He was entitled to live, for He had kept it; but the path of obedience and the glory of God meant His going into death, and in His having gone into it, it is morally suitable that He should go to the right hand of God. "Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him" @John 13: 31, 32. Death was the way to paradise -- Christ went down to the cross, and according to the will of God it was the way to paradise; that was not wonderful, but the wonder is that the *thief* should go to paradise. How was the thief fit to go where otherwise he could not have gone? Now Christ took account of the thief according to that fitness; it was the work of God in the man that fitted the man to go with Christ to paradise. But in order to go to paradise with Christ, he must also be cleared of every reproach which attached to him here. He had been identified here with theft and violence; he could not go to paradise with the reproach of that upon him; but Christ had come to the cross, that He might bear the reproach, and so clear the thief of it. It was Christ's death that cleared him of the
{206}
reproach, not his own death, but it was God's work in him which fitted him for paradise. It was the work of grace in the man which fitted him to go to paradise; the man was not only born again, but enlightened. He was at that moment the most divinely intelligent one on earth. The little light which had been, seemed to have been quenched, and the disciples had almost given up the thought of the kingdom. But this poor man testified to it, and said, "Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom".
Now turn to @2 Corinthians 12, "I knew a man in Christ ... such an one caught up to the third heaven ... caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter". There is a good deal of difference between the two cases. Here we get a man taken up to paradise on this side of death; this was not the case with the thief, he went to paradise on the other side of death. Now the thief could not have been said to be "in Christ"; to be "in Christ" could not be true of anyone until after Christ had died; but it has come to pass *now* -- "a man in Christ"; and what took place in the case of the apostle might be the case in regard of anyone else. In the wisdom of God it is possible that the apostle may have been specially privileged in this way, for a particular purpose in connection with his testimony; but we have to see that now another order of things has come in, in connection with Christ in heaven and the Holy Spirit down here; and we can be of His body here. *My* body describes myself. So the body of Christ is that which is descriptive of Himself in the very scene from which He has been rejected. Sovereign mercy has met us, and given us a place in that vessel which is descriptive of Christ; the church is "the fulness of him that filleth all in all". It is wonderful that God should take up vessels of mercy, and should form here a vessel which is down here descriptive of His Son. It is a great thing to accept what in the sovereignty of mercy we are called to. God has wrought in us, that we
{207}
might form part of that vessel in which Christ is set forth down here.
May grace work in us that we may answer to the mind of God, so that we may know something of the mighty power of the Spirit in us, springing up into everlasting life.
{208}
LABOUR
@Hebrews 4: 1 - 16; @Hebrews 5: 1 - 10
There is one thing striking in the ways of God, and that is, that His thoughts are repeated through the different stages of the world's history, as we get it in Scripture, and in that way we see the wonderful continuity of His ways from beginning to end. In this connection we can trace through Scripture the thought of the "rest of God". It comes out at the very commencement and again and again later, and then at the end it comes out in full development. Just turn for a moment to @Leviticus 23: 1 - 3. The sabbath comes out in this chapter not exactly as a feast, but with the characteristics of one, bringing in the true thought of the sabbath. The occasion was the gathering of the people round Jehovah, but it began with the sabbath of rest, and so whenever people are in relation with God we get a sabbath; I do not mean a legal sabbath, but the moral idea of one, figurative of the rest of God. After the works of creation God rested, and then in connection later on in the communication made to Moses in the history of the children of Israel, the sabbath again comes in, and God's desire was for the people to enter into the thought of the rest of God. Man had never really entered into His rest or His thought of the sabbath. It is easy to see this in regard of man either at the time of the creation or through all the history of God's earthly people, and then when we come to the time of David in the Psalms (as we get it quoted in this chapter), "As I have sworn". It refers to what took place in the wilderness: Israel was not to enter into the rest of God, but while they were not to enter, the passage brings in some who would do so -- this is implied; it was God's mind for some to enter into it, and with this conclusion in view we get, "There remaineth therefore a rest". We get it literally
{209}
in verse 10, "hath ceased from his own works". We still have to *labour*, that is a proof that we have not entered into the rest in actuality, for rest is a cessation from labour; we know it well in natural things. It was so with God when He found His rest in @Genesis 1.
Another point in regard to rest is the thought of complacency in that which the completion of the work produces; God could say at the beginning it was all "very good", and God's rest was connected with that. Complacency is a very essential element in the result of His labour. He has reached a spot where there is complacency. Sin came in, and all God's rest was marred by it; but the whole question has been taken up and all been settled in Christ, and He has now become the place for God's rest. Through Christ it has been passed on in the church, and then by and by creation will be brought into the good of it, as we get in @Romans 8: 19, etc. It is only waiting for the revelation of the sons of God down here: it will then all come out in manifestation. I am not now speaking of the new creation, but in reference to what God created at the outset. A great sifting is going on and will go on, but it is for the purpose that there may remain a harvest for God, in which God will be able to find complete complacency. It is an immense thing to have the rest of God before us, and for why? The reason is that we should not find our complacency in things around us. If we want to enter into God's rest, it is impossible to find complacency in things around, we have to *labour*, and that is a great contrast to sinking down in satisfaction with the things of this scene. It is a danger we have to keep in view. I do not suppose that any of us here would think of going on in the indulgence of gross sins, but it is extremely possible to settle down here and not to 'labour', finding our satisfaction and pleasure in the things of the world. This chapter contemplates the danger: the belief here referred to is not in regard to the gospel as first accepted but in regard to God's purpose for us; we are "kept by
{210}
the power of God through faith", and if faith is not in exercise and if the power failed, a man would perish by the way, and it is applicable to every one of us.
Well now, the Spirit of God would guard us against all this in this chapter. It is a great thing to remember that a sabbath-keeping *remains*. Israel never entered into it, and we which believe have not entered into it, for we have to labour, though we can now be in the characteristics of it. We have to accept that labour *will* terminate, but that it is not *yet* terminated, though by faith the other conditions have been made good in us. If grace has brought you to righteousness, the effect will be to produce 'labour'.
Now, beloved friends, I want to touch a little upon the divine provision that comes out for us in the latter part of the chapter, verse 12. I think in this passage there is a connection of great interest, that is, in the "word of God" and in the thought of the great High Priest that has passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God. We can put the two thoughts together. The word of God is *living*, and if we have a living thing it must of necessity be connected with a person. It does not say life-giving, but *living*, hence I have no manner of doubt that it is connected with a person. The wonderful thing is that when God saw fit to speak to man in His own Person He sent forth His own Son. He has spoken in Him; this is what we get in this epistle, God's speaking always had Christ in view, whether it was through the fathers or prophets, but at the last He spoke through His Son. He has become His own oracle, and then He passed into the heavens -- the great High Priest, Jesus the Son of God. He came into contact when down here with man, and into all the pressure of man's pathway here -- sickness, infirmities, bereavements, and it all produced exercise, and He has carried into the heaven as High Priest the experience He gained. The Son of God as the Word is God coming out, and the Son of God as High Priest is Man going in. We could not
{211}
understand the last without knowing the first.
Now one word more as to the word of God: it is *living, discriminating, searching*, simply because it is the revelation of God, the expression of God's thoughts in regard to man, and His thoughts to man of Himself in Christ. We get the *living* bread in @John 6 and we know it refers to Christ, the relationship has its perfect expression in Christ. It was all referred to in the past ages, and through God's previous dealings, and whichever way we look at it we find a reference to it in the Old Testament; all was foreshadowed, but it has now all been expressed in the Word of God, in the Person of the Son of God. It is God's perfect revelation of Himself all expressed in Christ. Everything in Him was a revelation of God. The light of the nature of God was all perfectly expressed in Him. If it is a *living* word, it is also discriminating and we live by it, it searches us; there is nothing more searching than the knowledge of God, it judges us, it breaks down the will of man. If you maintain a will you are not in the will of God. You cannot have anything of strength of will in the presence of the love of God, hence we must give up every purpose of will, and therefore it has to be broken. We get an instance of it in God's dealings with Job (chapter 33: 17), that He may "withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man". The ways of God are to that end; if man were right, *he* would *have* no purpose, no pride. God's dealings with us are to draw us away from our own wills. If man cherishes his own will and pride, he is going away from God and cannot enter into the thought of God's rest. It is impossible to cherish purpose of will or pride in the knowledge of God.
{212}
We are given the living bread as our food (@John 6): "As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me".
I have no doubt, beloved friends, the whole universe will live in Christ by and by. The world will be sustained in His life, because He is the revelation of God. Men will walk in the light of God because they will appreciate the grace of God. The bread of God came down from heaven. Then there is another thought in the provision that we may hold fast, He has passed into the heavens as High Priest. Christ has gone to the highest point from the place of the greatest degradation. He came out as the revelation of God to man, and He has gone in that He may be the High Priest in heaven. He has traversed the whole road, He has not gone in as He came out, but He has gone in as having gained practical experience in all the pressure of man's state. Who can gainsay the fact that man is pressed? Things here affect man as the consequence of his sin; but the blessed Son of God came into this scene and felt the pressure upon man. We get a beautiful instance of it in @John 11 when He was brought into contact with all the sorrow at Bethany, Himself took our infirmities, He felt it all in His spirit, even though He worked by His power for man's relief. Nothing can be more wonderful, "we have not an high priest which cannot be touched", etc., therefore we can come boldly to the throne of grace.
He was brought under man's pressure, and in the experience He gained by it He is able to succour them that are tried, that is the corresponding link to the One who is at the right hand of God. It seems to me it must have a profound effect in breaking the will of man for him to know there is a heart in heaven touched with sympathy for all tried by the pressure of the way.
The One that came out from God is the perfect expression of God's mind to man, and He is also the One now in the presence of God (as having been in spirit under man's pressure) for man. The two thoughts
{213}
formerly separated are now united in the blessed Person of the Son of God. It is a wonderful thing to contemplate the Word of God, the living One, the discriminating One, the Searcher, all naked and open to Him, the One who is the perfect revelation of and expression of God's mind to man, and then on the other side to see Him as the One who gained in His life here all the experience necessary to fit Him to be a great High Priest in the heavens, pointing us on to the rest where God has found complacency. At the present moment God is working out the question of good and evil in the view of His rest.
Now one word more as to what we get in the next chapter in regard to the *calling*. He does not take this up of Himself; He was called to it of God. The calling of priesthood belongs to Christ, He was called to it of God. Our calling is sonship. Christ was to sit down at God's right hand till His enemies were made His footstool. He was called in the power of an endless life. The first according to @Psalm 2 on the one hand, and the second according to @Psalm 110 "a priest for ever". Everything was to be of God. In regard to ourselves, I do not deny the truth of christian priesthood, but it must be in connection with Christ, and the point is, we must prove our *kindred* to *Christ*. It does not consist in any setting apart by man, or man's ordination, it will never make a man a priest. We are called to be sons; priesthood is in connection with an endless life. Christ is the Author and Finisher of faith, and our place is to be brought into eternal salvation. At the present moment He is in the place of intercession for God's house: a reference to this is found in @Romans 8. He makes intercession for us, and Sons constitute God's house. It is a great point to be able to prove our kindred to Christ; He is bringing many sons to glory. May we go on contemplating Christ, and as sons of God come out from God! Christ is the perfect expression of God's purpose for man; He is making intercession for us. He has reached that place
{214}
in the heavens, after having gone under all the pressure of man's estate here. And, beloved friends, we cannot rebel against Christ without incurring the consequences: He that is not subject to the Son has the wrath of God abiding on him; he that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life.
The Son of God is God's great test to man. I pray for all here, and for myself in particular, that Christ may have a much larger place in our hearts.
{215}
NOTES OF READINGS ON JAMES
Chapter 3
James labours to bring christians out into distinctness. The start is, "Of his own will begat he us". Then there is the receiving the implanted word with meekness, and salvation is by the implanted word -- that is, christianity. Then we get that there is no respect of persons in christianity in presence of the Lord of glory. Then in works you see unity: all distinctions are gone, and Abraham and Rahab are brought together by their works, prefiguring the Jew and the gentile together.
In chapter 3 you get the contrast brought out between the old man and the new man. The man of the world is known by the use of his tongue, the wise man -- the new man -- is known by wisdom; one is from beneath, the other from above. The wise man is one who has wisdom from above. The tongue is wrong, because man's will is wrong, and you cannot set the will right. Lying belongs to or characterises the old man, and the truth characterises the new, so we get in @Ephesians 4 "putting away lying", and that the new man is created after God in righteousness and holiness of truth.
A large ship is at the disposal of the helmsman, but you can do nothing with the tongue, it cannot be tamed.
Christianity is positive and not merely negative: the tongue is not capable of being corrected. Knowledge is a great thing with us, it is not what a christian can talk, but what he knows. Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge? The substance of christianity really consists in knowledge: "this is life eternal, that they might know thee". So, too, let not the rich man glory in riches, but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth Me.
Ques. Should not the tongue of a christian now be used by God and for God?
{216}
F.E.R. I think a christian has to shew his works and guard against his tongue. You yourself are to be governed by wisdom, and then the tongue will be used in wisdom. The wise man is really another man, it is not exactly a question of restraining or reforming the tongue: the tongue can no man tame. The wise man is endued with wisdom and then endued with knowledge. The wise man is one who has appreciation of Christ, and then there is a point further, he is endued with knowledge. As you appreciate Christ, you walk as He walked in the will of God: He was found in the path of God's will; so these things spoken of as characterising wisdom are the very things we see as characterising Him. He was pure, peaceable and so on. We appreciate that: let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness, etc., then the tongue falls into its proper place. There is a great revolution, now works are apparent and the tongue is secondary; formerly the tongue was everything and works -- good works -- were secondary. I want first to see righteousness in a christian, next I want to see a man in whom is abhorrence of everything unholy or impure. The new man on earth is the witness of the glorified Man in heaven, so it is a most important thing that the new man should be seen, and that is by works; you put off the old man and put on the new. Wisdom came in really in Christ coming here, but @Proverbs 8 shews that wisdom was ever there for man. Truth has come in to shew everything in its proper place and proportion in regard of, or relation to, God. People may go on in such a way that they virtually lie against the truth. When you see christians eager as to getting on in this world, or self-confident or self-asserting, they are virtually lying against the truth. What can be said against a man who is first pure, then peaceable, etc. That man is a christian. Appreciation of Christ is the only thing which will effect it in man. We ought all of us to be set on entering the holiest, and if we do, we shall come out like this with the wisdom which is from above. A poor
{217}
and wise child is better than an old king that will not be admonished. The christian is the poor and wise child, he has wisdom from above. In a christian it is apprehending what Christ is in the holiest that enables a man to come out rightly in wisdom here. Wisdom signifies really God's resource, and you only really learn Christ as God's resource in the holiest. The holiest was seen in the tabernacle of old, but the veil was there, and the veil would not have been there if sin had not been there separating from God; but God had a resource behind the veil -- even Christ. I can go to God and I am at home in His presence. Nothing now is displayed, but I can go into His presence and see His resource there in Christ.
In coming to the assembly you must bring with you the best that you have got.
Chapter 4
We get the other part of the epistle here; it really divides at the end of chapter 3. In the first part of the epistle we see unfolded what christianity really is, we see how God wrought in us, of His own will begetting us, that we should be a kind of first-fruits of His creatures.
Then we have brought before us the perfect law of liberty, and then unity of life in chapter 2, and in chapter 3, the old man and the new.
These are the great principles of christianity. James is very practical and extremely striking, he does not bring it out exactly doctrinally, but practically; it is not much good exhorting people to keep the unity of the Spirit unless you can shew them the groundwork.
Certain things are true in Christ whatever may be the practice of the saints.
In James you really get the living out the *truth that is*; so we get the having put off the old man and the having put on the new, and that is in connection with "as the
{218}
truth is in Jesus".
In chapters 4 and 5 the Spirit addresses Himself to the twelve tribes as they were; you find traces of christianity in the chapters. James addresses here the twelve tribes as to what was wrong among them, and reproves them; the link was not actually broken with the twelve tribes; James, however, identifies himself with those who had the *faith* of our Lord Jesus Christ, that is, those who were true christians. The *Jew* ought not to be the friend of the world, because they were His people, separated from the nations; the Jews were at all events separated from Babylon.
He does not address the twelve tribes as "my brethren", but when he uses that term he intends the christians amongst them, those who have the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ. How much more is the friendship of the world wrong for the christian! Egypt is the gross world, Babylon is the world of man's glory.
Even amongst us worldly glory has too much place. Hereditary glory is nothing worth to me; it is part of the world's system. The christian should not be dazzled by worldly glory; Christ is the Head of every man; if you get Him in that way before you, then earthly glory pales; Babylon is the system in which man is glorified. You respect a tax-gatherer, but you would not think of glorifying him. Any part a man may have in the glory of the world will hinder him in coming in contact with the saints of God. When the blessed Lord was on earth there was nothing to stand between Him and the poorest person He came in contact with. Honour is due to those who have a place in the government of the country; as a rule they have moral worth of some kind. There is a moral dignity about the carriage of a christian here in dealing with the world, as seen in the case of Abraham purchasing the cave of Machpelah from the children of Heth.
As to praying for those who rule, it is just as important to pray for the Czar of Russia if you want peace for the
{219}
saints, because peace really depends as much on the Czar as on England. In this country we are so peaceful that not much is heard of that prayer; if trouble arose no doubt we should hear it more; we have to leave the world to manage itself under the providence of God.
The world is not put under Christ, but the world to come is, and I must be loyal to that; Jerusalem will be the joy of the whole earth. Israel will be the centre of the world to come. The Lord does not allow you to judge your brother, or you get down below the level of the law. We have to carry out the law -- not to speak evil one of another. We talk too much about one another; we are to speak *truth* one with another, with our neighbour, for that tends to edify. This advice, 'that in conversation it is better to talk about *things* rather than *persons*', is good. The hearts of christians should be exercised in love for one another, and we should be praying for one another. There is a disposition to judge one another's motives; many things in the church which come out never would come out if there were more love and more pastoral care.
The last verse of the chapter is a moral principle, they knew the law and did not do it, therefore it was sin to them; it was a sin of omission, but it was a sin. You may do things without reference to the will of God, as in changes we may make as to our abode, etc.; you must consider the Lord in the detail of life. It is a great thing to recollect that we are strangers and pilgrims here; we are not entitled to an easy path and circumstances here.
{220}
ENTRANCE INTO THE HOLIEST
@2 Corinthians 5: 12 - 21
The steps by which we enter in to God are the reverse to those steps by which God has come out. As to entering into the most holy place, to understand this you must know the way God has come out. He came out by Christ, and so He really came out by Himself; in that way He became His own testimony. I have pointed out before that where man ends there God began; the holiest is the highest, and there He began, God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself.
Christ came here in God's fidelity to the promises, but that was not the height from which God was acting, but it is seen in reconciling the world to Himself. He was no longer testing man, but took a new course, that is, reconciling the world to Himself. It is seen in @Luke 2 where the multitude of the heavenly host say, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good pleasure in men".
That was the *birth* of Christ, but God draws even nearer still in the death of Christ. This shews His disposition toward us, it is seen in the new covenant. Then we get the proclamation, and next we get the entering into the holiest, and with this reconciliation, the two being intimately connected; but God started from the holiest, and that is where we find Christ now, where He abides in the holy love of God -- the holiest.
There are three great steps in the progress of christians. The first great landmark is when you learn that you are married to Christ. The second great landmark is when you learn what it is to behold the glory of the Lord with unveiled face and are changed. The third great landmark is when you draw nigh. If you turn to @Romans 7: 4, every step *we* have to take is in contrast to what Israel had to go through. Christ has become law to us --
{221}
we all need law, there is nothing lawless in nature, God never intended that we should be lawless: anarchists are no good, they are lawless. Christ is the only one standard morally; so we get the exhortation, "Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ", @Galatians 6: 2.
Now in @Romans 7 they are severed from the first husband that they might be married to another. A man *will* covet, he cannot help it, and the law only could condemn him for doing it; but as regards the christian we have the support of Christ by His Spirit: so the Lord said in @Matthew 11, "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; ... and ye shall find rest unto your souls". No one ever brought forth fruit to God save by the Spirit. Severed from Him we can do nothing. We all ought to be exercised about bringing forth fruit to God, and by the Spirit only is it done.
Now I touch upon @2 Corinthians 3; we behold the glory of the Lord, we are privileged to be in the presence of glory unveiled. God is seen in holy splendour in the death of Christ; though it really was the darkest of moments, yet there God was glorified, and now we behold the glory of the Lord, and the practical effect is that we become like God and like one another.
Israel was tied to a husband that could not support them; how different in our case (@Romans 7: 4), the Husband does support us, does help us.
Then we come to @2 Corinthians 5, if any man be in Christ it is new creation. If the word of reconciliation was committed to Paul, then evidently the reconciliation itself was there. You therefore get more even than when Christ was here.
The bearing of reconciliation is, that everything which is not of Christ must disappear. The application to us morally is, if any man be in Christ it is new creation; you cannot bear with or tolerate the inclinations of the flesh or will; now it is *new* creation; the meaning is that we might have boldness to enter the holiest.
{222}
In Old Testament times the priest had to wash his body with water ere entering; now all takes place in the *mind* of the christian, and if you are before God in the holiest the old things have passed away and all things become new, and all things are of God: the product of His own grace and His Spirit in the soul, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him -- all was gold in the holiest, there the christian can be with no sense of the working of the flesh, that we might become so that God might have His delight in His people in the holiest. The great point of reconciliation is, that we should not receive the grace of God in vain, that is, we have our place in the world for the service of God.
As to the state of the mind, old things are passed away. It is a great thing to be before God, sprinkled as to our hearts from an evil conscience, and washed as to our bodies with pure water, then we can come out here in this world for God, we can turn God's grace to good account down here.
You are before God for His perfect complacency; this is the third step, and it is a wonderful thing: old things are passed away. For God all is gone in the death of Christ, but it has to be recognised on our part that all for us has been terminated in the death of Christ.
{223}
THE TRUE GROUND OF PRIESTHOOD
@Numbers 16: 1 - 50; @Numbers 17: 1 - 13
We have to remember that all the things written aforetime were written for our learning. They were not written for the time in which they happened, but for our instruction.
The immediate occasion of what we get in chapter 17 concerning the priesthood was the gainsaying of Korah. This is referred to in @Jude 11, in which we are given prophetically in a few words the moral progress of defection in christendom. We get three landmarks of declension clearly stated:
1. Gone in the way of Cain;
2. Run greedily after the error of Balaam for reward;
and
3. Perished in the gainsaying of Core.
The climax presents the final state of corruption in christendom, that in which it *has* perished. That word 'perished' often occurs in the New Testament as representing a state of apostasy. "Son of perdition" is the same idea. Christendom has accepted and settled down in a condition and things in which morally it has perished, and there is no hope of its recovery.
The sin of Korah was that the Levites claimed the priesthood. Now for priesthood there must be two qualifications: the call to it, and the grace suited to the call, and both from God. Korah claimed the priesthood without either the call or the grace for it. His company claimed it as Levites, and he and his house all perished by the fire of God. They were put to the test by the offering of incense. See chapter 16 verses 16 - 22.
The Levites were properly *servants* -- their call was not to the worship of God, but to the carrying of the tabernacle and its vessels. The Levites were dependent for direction on the priests, but they had nothing to do
{224}
with the handling of the holy vessels. Now Korah and his company ignored this, and assuming priestly work, the judgment of God overtook them; and in the next chapter (chapter 17) God gives the proof of attestation of priesthood.
The budding and blossoming of Aaron's rod did not give Aaron title to priesthood, it was God's call which gave him title to it, and no doubt with the call he received the grace suited to the call, which sustained him in it. The budding of the rod was the *attestation* of his priesthood, and it signified life out of death (or resurrection in principle), as the witness and power of the priesthood. The people were so affected by it that they were overcome with fear, and exclaimed: "Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish". They felt that to come near the tabernacle was death to them, and they were right; for flesh and for rebellious man it presented death.
Now in chapter 18 God lays down the relative places of priests and Levites. There the Lord speaks to *Aaron*, not to Moses. The responsibility of the tabernacle and of its service fell upon Aaron and his sons. The Levites had the bearing of the tabernacle -- only they were not to come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary lest they should die. I think in this there was an expression of grace on the part of God, for they had offended, and offended grievously. God in His grace did not set the Levites aside, but assigned to them their proper place with regard to Aaron the priest and the tabernacle, and after this He says: "The stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death".
Now the question for us is, What instruction do we get from all this? In our day we have certainly come to the gainsaying of Core. There is around us the exclusive claim to priesthood by those who are in the responsibility of ministers. Now the first question I should ask of such is, 'Show me your call;' and the next would be, 'Have you the grace for the call?' If you have not these, then you are in rebellion. That is the position of the clergy
{225}
of the present day. I do not suppose people have any idea of what an awful thing the principle of clergy is in the eye of God. It represents the apostate condition into which christianity has lapsed. The activities of the Spirit of God are not exercised through it but *in spite* of it. God's thought of priesthood is to be found only in life out of death. Now this proof of priesthood is seen only in Christ. It says in @Hebrews 7: 15, 16: "there ariseth another priest, who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life". The fact of an endless life in man is brought to pass in resurrection, and that is in Christ. The foundation of priesthood is in death, and the attestation of it in resurrection. There can be *no* priest but on the principle of life out of death. You get this set forth in type in Aaron.
But the thought of priesthood is not limited to Aaron: there were also his sons, who were joined with him in the priesthood; so in order to get a complete idea of priesthood, we must take in Aaron and his sons, that is, not only Christ, but Christ and the church.
Now I want to bring this out in connection with the truth that God has appointed a Head for man, and that, in the Man who has accomplished righteousness; and in the Head we get One who communicates living water to man.
In all this we have the expression of the grace of God towards man. Every man is tested by the introduction of a Head, and it is according to the thought of God that any and every man should come to Christ and get from Him living water. Righteousness and life in the Head are God's thought for *every* man. If I have apprehended the Head, and have received from the Head righteousness and living water, there follows another thing, and that is that I recognise the call of God. If you turn to @Romans 8: 34, you will see that this passage brings in the thought of Christ's priesthood, and that is for the elect. "Who also maketh intercession for us", *not for everybody* and anybody.
{226}
At first a believer knows nothing of the call of God, but a moment arrives in the history of the christian when he is bound to recognise that he is called of God. "Whom he called, them he also justified". When we have received the Spirit, we recognise that we are subjects of the sovereign mercy of God. Why do you love God? Because He first loved you.
Now what I have said is in connection with Christ as Head. In accepting the Head, you get righteousness in Him and the gift of living water, and then you find that God first loved you, and that He has called you.
Now the next point is, what are you called to? All saints are not called to the same things. Israel was called to national blessing; we are not called to that; it is evident from @Romans 8: 29 that we are called to sonship. God has predestinated us to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the First-born among many brethren: on our part -- that we should be in association with His Son. Christ is First-born, that is, pre-eminent among many brethren. God has seen fit so to call us. I cannot explain it, and I would not question it. God has been pleased so to call us that we should be in association with His Son as the First-born among many brethren. Priesthood comes in in connection with this, and we have thus the fulfilment of the type of Aaron and his sons. "I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee".
Now if a man says he is a priest, I would ask him on what ground. If you are a priest you must have received the call of God, to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the First-born among many brethren. There you get the first requisite of a priest, and a layman may be that; saints have been called to it, and the proof of it is that they love God by the Spirit of God. Any christian that recognises the call of God can say he is a priest.
Priesthood hangs upon sonship. Christ is priest
{227}
because He is Son. We, too, are sons, and so we are priests.
The next thing is, the *grace* suited to the call to priesthood. Korah and his sons had neither the call nor the grace suited to it. Nor have those who assume the priesthood in christendom today -- that is the clergy; if they had, they would not assume the official position.
If you desire to see what the grace suited to the call is, turn to @Ephesians 2: 13, "*in* Christ Jesus *ye* ... are become nigh". And further, in verse 18, "through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father". Here we get the antitype of Aaron -- Christ, and through Him by the Spirit we have access, so that you have not only the call, but the grace for the call.
We get the same in principle also in @John 20, where the Lord, after He had said, "go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God", breathes on the disciples and says, "Receive the Holy Spirit". We have here the antitype of Aaron and his sons. We are in association with Christ as the First-born among many brethren, and have access to the Father, through the Spirit. Christ communicated the Spirit that we might have access: we could not have it without the Spirit.
Now the proof of priesthood is life out of death. The principle on which priesthood hangs is resurrection, for we cannot be in association with the Son of God except on the platform of life out of death, that is, on resurrection ground. "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit". Christ has been pleased to enter on that ground, and association with Him cannot be on any other. No one can be a priest except on that ground. All assumption of priesthood otherwise is an imposture.
You may reply, 'But we are down here on earth, how can we then be in life out of death?' If you turn to @Colossians 2: 12, 13 you get two thoughts, one that we are risen together with Christ, and the other that we are
{228}
quickened together with Him. Both expressions have reference to life out of death. Each has its own particular bearing, but always quickening is associated with life out of death.
Even as regards Christ it says, "Being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit". Now as risen with Christ we are men of another order, we belong neither to Jew nor gentile. Quickening results in a power of affection in the heart of the christian which can carry him superior to distinctions that exist in the flesh. There can be no distinctions of flesh in the presence of Christ. As quickened with Christ my slave is as dear to me as any other man. This can only be in the power of spiritual affection in the presence of Christ. Ye "have put on the new man ... where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all". @Colossians 3: 10. Every order of man has disappeared save Christ.
We have had before us, first, the call; secondly, the grace in the saints suited to the call, and the proof of the call. Now return to @Numbers 18: 7, "Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's office ... I have given your priest's office unto you as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death". In chapter 17: 12, the children of Israel had said, "Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish". When the flesh comes into the presence of these things there is *death* before it, and so it must be, and we must accept death as to the flesh, for association with Christ is an end to all the things in which flesh lives. When the people saw the rod of Aaron budding, they recognised something too great for them. God is not served by man after the flesh. What is going on around us is mockery of God, who is not served, and cannot be by man as such. The very things in which life towards God consists are death to the flesh. None can serve God but those alive out of death.
There is another thing, the priests come under the
{229}
iniquity of the sanctuary; that is, we feel the state of things in christendom by which we are surrounded. We come under the burden of it and are susceptible now to the discipline of God.
There is one thing further. The Levites were to be joined to the priests for the particular service to which God had called them; and now there is no true Levitical service apart from the priest.
In our day we have come in christendom to the state of things represented by the gainsaying of Korah, and if we would be in the truth of priesthood according to God, we must find out the ground on which priesthood rests.
Then we have to carry on our hearts the burden of the state of things in which the saints of God are found around us.
I have presented things which may not be quite intelligible to all, but if you consider the principles I have indicated you will find something that may be of help.
{230}
THE CONDITIONS OF CHRISTIAN LIFE DOWN HERE
@Hebrews 9: 11 - 28
F.E.R. I suggested this passage that we might get an idea of the conditions in which, as christians, we live here; for in living even in a natural way you must live under certain conditions; and so in spiritual things there are conditions in which we live. It is under the New Testament that we live. The testament brings out the conditions in which man can live in regard to God.
Ques. Does that come out in this chapter?
F.E.R. Well, there is purgation and the inheritance in verses 14, 15.
Rem. Then the new covenant brings out the conditions?
F.E.R. Yes, and because it sets forth the love and mercy of God.
Rem. So that just as it is essential for us to have air and food as the conditions of natural life, we need the love and mercy of God as the conditions of our spiritual life.
F.E.R. Yes. The conditions of spiritual life are the love and mercy of God.
Ques. Do the conditions involve christianity?
F.E.R. Not exclusively, for the same conditions will apply to the Jew by and by.
Two things come out in the chapter: first, the blood of the new covenant for purgation; and secondly, the death of the testator and the validity of the testament.
Ques. What is the idea of the covenant being connected with blood?
F.E.R. The covenant could not be made without blood -- the blood of purgation.
Rem. In the first covenant the people were sprinkled with blood.
{231}
F.E.R. Yes; that was in figure purgation, for you cannot get the idea of purgation without blood.
Ques. Was not the covenant the closing up of one condition of things and the opening up of another?
F.E.R. Yes. In human things if the father of a family dies and leaves a will, all is changed and the family then have to live according to the conditions of the will.
Ques. Does the blood come in here as removing the former state of sins?
F.E.R. Yes; it is purgation. You could not come into the good of the new covenant without purgation.
Ques. What are the heavenly things?
F.E.R. Christianity brings in heavenly things.
Ques. Is it heavenly things on earth?
F.E.R. Well, that is what christianity is. We have to live in the love of God, and the practical life of christianity is in the revelation of God as He has made Himself known in Christ. The cup which we bless is the new covenant in Christ's blood.
Ques. What does that signify?
F.E.R. The disposition of God, which has come out in the death of Christ. Our state has become the occasion for God to make Himself known.
Ques. I thought that God commended His love towards us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Is there not a different disposition towards us now as saints?
F.E.R. How?
Rem. He loves us now as His sons, He loves us as He loves the Son.
F.E.R. The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit that is given to us. The love that God commends to us is the love that is shed abroad in our hearts, and that is the love that was expressed in the death of Christ. He commends His love towards us who are now christians. He loved us *in spite* of our being sinners, not *as* sinners, but *when* we were sinners.
{232}
Ques. Would you say that all we know now of the love of God was involved in the first expression of that love?
F.E.R. Yes; God always begins at the top. He speaks the best thing from the outset. He speaks from Himself -- from the top.
Ques. Are there not many who never get beyond the fact of God's love to them as sinners?
F.E.R. But there is a root error there. They think that God loved them *as* sinners.
Ques. What is the fact?
F.E.R. That He loved them *though* they were sinners -- *in spite of it*.
Ques. Is there not a condition of soul in which a believer never gets beyond what a convert of a few weeks old has?
F.E.R. Yes; and the reason is, they rest in statements of scripture instead of in the Spirit of God. His object is to get souls into the sense of His love, and it is in His house that God is known.
Ques. How do we come into the house? Is it by baptism?
F.E.R. No; by the Spirit. Baptism brings people into the precincts of the house, "the court which is without" (@Revelation 11); but it is the Spirit which brings you *into* the house of God.
Ques. But you would not occupy people with the Spirit within them?
F.E.R. But the Spirit *is* in you shedding abroad the love of God.
Ques. Is not the Spirit objective?
F.E.R. How?
Rem. You look to Him as a Person to lead you.
F.E.R. Yes, and He is a divine Person.
Rem. I have been greatly impressed of late with the fact of how very much we have overlooked the importance of the Holy Spirit.
F.E.R. I am glad to hear you say that! The Spirit is the great power of christianity.
{233}
Ques. Are not all baptised people in the house?
F.E.R. Infants are not in the house. By baptism they are brought into the precincts of the house where the Spirit dwells.
Ques. I have always understood that baptism brought you into the house. Has it not always been taught in that way?
F.E.R. It appears to me that Christ is the Builder of the house. No one could be in the house without the Spirit, for it is a spiritual house.
Ques. Then you do not look at two aspects of the house?
F.E.R. No. I recognise what is *called* a "great house", that is, christendom -- the result of man's work.
Ques. Judgment begins at the house of God?
F.E.R. Well, that is as christians.
Ques. How?
F.E.R. Look at the passage, @1 Peter 4: 16, "if any man suffer as a Christian". Then, "if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear? Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator". If judgment begins at the house of God, it means judgment coming in, in the way of discipline, as regards christians.
Ques. Then you do not regard Simon (@Acts 8) as being in the house?
F.E.R. No, indeed! *Christ is the Builder* of God's house, and what He builds is a spiritual house.
Ques. In what sense are servants builders?
F.E.R. They build up christianity.
Ques. Then you would not object to saying they are in the assembly?
F.E.R. No.
Ques. Then the house of God in the sense you speak of is as much the pillar and ground of the truth as ever?
F.E.R. Yes, indeed. I think Christ built the house of God, and the house of God abides which Christ
{234}
built, and it is the pillar and ground of the truth. The apostle took up an assembly as he found it, and he had misgivings about many in it, but underneath all, the house is there; there may be external confusion, but underneath all the confusion there is the house, which is the pillar and ground of the truth.
Ques. What is the difference between the body and the house? We used to think that the house was the external thing, and the body the real and internal thing.
F.E.R. I think we have let down too much the ideas of the house; the house is for God and the body is for Christ. The house is the tabernacle of God. In Colossians we get the body; in Ephesians the idea is more of the house.
Rem. We were in the habit of regarding the external view of the house to be that which man built, and the internal -- the body, that which Christ built, the true thing.
F.E.R. What I would maintain is, that though confusion has come in, the house abides as the true thing.
Ques. What is the difference between the house and the temple?
F.E.R. They are much the same; the temple is the shrine. Christ, when He was here, prepared the materials, and the Spirit given by Him on the day of Pentecost recognised the work of Christ and took up His abode there; and the house has been a complete thing ever since.
Ques. What is "groweth unto an holy temple"?
F.E.R. That is, it is growing up to the time of display.
Ques. What is being builded up a spiritual house?
F.E.R. It is in coming to Christ as the Son of the living God, and so you are built up.
Ques. You think the house was there at Pentecost, and that the Spirit came and took possession of a complete thing?
F.E.R. Yes. Christ as Son of David built the house.
Ques. Was the house there before the body?
{235}
F.E.R. No; the Spirit formed the body.
Ques. Would you say the presence of the Spirit constituted the house?
F.E.R. Well, all was there, and it only needed that the Spirit should take up His abode.
Ques. Then you do not think there are two aspects of the house?
F.E.R. I do not; what led me to think about the matter was the passage in @Hebrews 3, "whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end". They were recognised as the house on that condition. Christ is the Builder, and saints are proved to be the house of God if they hold fast.
Ques. But you would admit that there is a great house?
F.E.R. Yes; there is a great, pretentious thing which is likened to a great house, but I look on the house as really God's children -- His household, His family.
Ques. What is building wood, hay and stubble?
F.E.R. But that is not into the house at all. I think God brings people into His house that He may instruct them. People in system get little instruction because they do not recognise the presence of the Spirit in God's house; those who do, have got great gain. What hinders us is the attempt, and that especially on the part of the young, to drag in the world. They have been brought up in connection with the assembly, and have come in without much exercise or opposition, and they, it may be unwittingly, bring the world in with them, and if we do not look out we shall be swamped by it.
Rem. We need to live in the conditions of life.
F.E.R. Yes, "walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness and meekness, with long suffering, forbearing one another in love; endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace".
Ques. Where does baptism bring you to?
F.E.R. Into the precincts of the house, and it involves leaving the world. By baptism you come into
{236}
the place of profession; it brings a child there, for it is to be brought up in the nurture and discipline of the Lord. It is a great point for me that there can be nothing really here for God at the present time outside of the Spirit, except responsibility.
To return to our subject. We cannot live now except within the limits which Christ has imposed upon those who are in God's habitation; these are the love and mercy of God. Solomon imposed upon Shimei certain limitations within which to live. If he went beyond them it was death. Christians often expect that they are to be prospered in this world.
Ques. That is perhaps why people are unhappy?
F.E.R. Yes, they do not live in the conditions of the new covenant, that is, the love and mercy of God.
Ques. Do you not think that people live too much down here in the conditions of this life instead of in those of the house of God?
F.E.R. Yes, and they are hardly as happy as people in the world, because they are not in the good of either the world or the covenant.
Ques. Why do you bring in the love and mercy of God?
F.E.R. Because God says, "I will be merciful to their unrighteousnesses, and their sins and their lawlessnesses I will never remember any more"; and He will write His laws in their hearts.
It is a wonderful thing to be in the sense of divine mercy -- vessels of mercy. Mercy carries you on to glory. "Looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life". "Vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory".
Ques. I should like to ask our brother C -- as to what the light is he has got lately regarding the Spirit?
Rem. It is that I am impressed by the fact that people have overlooked the truth that there is a *divine* Person on earth, and that we are in the good and power of the presence of that Person here.
{237}
THE ACTIVITIES OF THE LORD
@Acts 9: 1 - 43
I desire to shew you, if I can, the great importance of what comes before us in this chapter. It presents a new starting-point in the ways of God, and I wish to make that plain. We have in this chapter the first account in the Acts of the Lord in activity from on high. In chapter 1 He gives commandments to the apostles, and ascends to heaven, and in chapter 7 Stephen looks up and sees Him standing on the right hand of God.
Now in this chapter the Lord is seen in activity, and that signifies a new starting-point. What took place previously in a certain sense overlapped -- it was the end, but here we get the real beginning. And the chapter is interesting in that it presents the character of the Lord's activities from the start to the finish: it brings in view the "world to come", for that is, I suppose, the point at the end of the chapter.
I do not think that people generally understand the difference between Christ as Head and as Lord. He is both. It is a question of the way in which you apprehend Christ. If you apprehend Him on the part of man He is Head, and if you apprehend Him on the part of God He is Lord of all.
As an illustration. Supposing the House of Commons were summoned to the House of Lords to hear a proclamation from the Prince of Wales on behalf of the Queen, it would go headed by the Speaker -- its head. In the House of Lords the Prince of Wales would represent the Queen. The House of Commons would be in accord with the Speaker, who is the first Commoner and the head, not the lord, of the house. In the House of Lords the Queen would be represented by the Prince of Wales -- he would represent the authority of the Queen.
So Christ, as Lord, represents to us all the authority
{238}
of God, but He is also Head as to man. He is the Head, and we are *of* Him, because we have partaken of His Spirit, and if we have partaken of the Spirit of Christ then we are Christ's. We recognise Him as Head, and He directs us. That is the position of christians. Now in @Acts 9 we do not see the Head, but the Lord. We have the Person who is Head, but He is seen here as Lord. Two thoughts are connected with lordship -- first there is administration.
We get an illustration of the Lord's administration in His feeding of the multitude in @Matthew 14. He used the disciples in connection with the administration, but He Himself was the Administrator.
The second thought connected with lordship is subduing power. (@Philippians 3: 20) "We await the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour, who shall transform our body of humiliation into conformity to his body of glory, according to the working of the power which he has even to subdue all things to himself". Here we get the subduing power which is His as Lord. There is also connected with Him as Lord the thought of authority and judgment, for all judgment is committed to Him; but that has mainly to do with enemies. God has brought us into the kingdom of the Son of His love that we may be able to stand against the power of evil. We are to "Be strong in the Lord". We ought to have a great sense of the authority of Christ as Lord as against all that is contrary to God; every enemy will be subdued by Him, even death itself. He will enforce authority over death, and the dead will come forth out of their graves; His authority is made good in that all judgment is committed to Him.
Now before taking up the detail of this chapter I refer to the two previous ones, chapter 7: 54 - 60, 8: 32 - 38. In chapter 7 we see Stephen looking up to heaven, where he sees the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, verses 55 - 60. The Jews stoned Stephen, calling upon God and saying, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice,
{239}
Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep".
Then at the close of the next chapter (verses 33 - 39) we get the account of the enlightenment of the eunuch. And Philip baptised him. He passed out of sight. What I want to shew is that we have in these chapters the termination of that which had previously existed for God; and this is important for this reason, you could not get a new starting-point in chapter 9 if all had not first been closed up with regard to the things that previously existed for God. You could not understand the Lord's action in this chapter otherwise, and it gives to this chapter great importance. The Lord has no present connection with this world. He is rejected, and sits on the right hand of God, and His present activity is to lead us outside this scene.
The time will come when the Lord will have to say to the world; that will be in authority and judgment, but that does not hinder His activities *now*, which are not exercised with relation to the world, and therefore I would not go to the *Lord* in connection with anything of the world. He is active as concerning His people down here, but His activity is in order to lead the subjects of it *out* of the world.
The object of chapter 7 is to shew that every promise and purpose of God connected with the earth has been taken from the earth, and carried up in Jesus into heaven. Every interest of God connected with the Jew -- His earthly people -- has been carried up into heaven in the Person of Christ.
Stephen saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. The Son of man, the centre of all God's purposes, is on the right hand of God, and Stephen was going to heaven to Him. There was a complete end of all on earth. God had repudiated the temple. He says, "Heaven is my throne", &c. Every promise and purpose was carried up for the time into heaven.
Now in chapter 8 Philip explains to the eunuch in regard to Jesus that His *life is taken from the earth*. The
{240}
eunuch was a God-fearing man, but he did not understand what he read. Philip interprets it to him, and when he understood it he says, "See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?" He apprehended that the life of Jesus had been taken from the earth, and he desired to be identified with His death. Baptism signified the end of every hope and expectation here, as connected with the flesh, and from the point of baptism there is nothing whatever for the one baptised but what is from the Spirit of God, and He will enable man's soul to live in the reality of the love and mercy of God. I wish all would take this in. The Spirit will enable you to live in the region which God has opened out for you in the revelation of His love and mercy. He will set Himself against the flesh. If you accept your baptism, you will expect *nothing* from the flesh, but you will find *everything* in the Spirit.
And then chapter 9 is given to us to shew us the activities of Christ now as Lord on high, acting in subduing power here, and it carries us on to the kingdom and the power of the world to come, which is probably seen in the raising up of Aeneas and of Tabitha, at the close of it. I desire to shew you the effect of this power and these activities.
The first to come under the influence of this power was Saul of Tarsus. Chapter 9: 1 - 9.
I have no doubt that the purpose of the Lord in this was to raise up a very special instrument, and the work of this instrument was to take precedence of all that had been before. Not that God ignored what had taken place previously to this, but the new takes precedence of the old. What is expressed in the case of Saul is not the exercise of authority in judgment, but subduing power.
Saul was a most contrary man, but we see in him the Lord's activity in "the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself".
If you ask me whether I do not think that there was also a work of God in Saul, I say there was, but that is
{241}
not the point here; the side we get here is the subduing power of the Lord, and Saul could not stand before it. In the lifetime of Christ on earth we find that the character of His activities was of the nature of subduing. If He found those who were suffering under the power of evil He subdued it. Here He subdues Saul of Tarsus, and He can do the same thing today if He sees fit; for that same subduing power is found in Him; and presently He will exercise that mighty power with regard to our bodies. It is a wonderful thought.
Now in verses 10 - 16 we come to another point and that is *administration*. The power of the Lord is there put forth not exactly in subduing, for Ananias was a disciple, but in appointing a vessel through which the Lord could administer. It is another interesting activity of power in connection with Christ as Lord. An object of His administration is to bring souls into christian fellowship.
Baptism is a very important point in this. It is intended to dissociate you from all that is contrary to the Lord, and the activities of the Lord are exercised in order to bring you into the blessings of christian fellowship, and we see here this administration, which belongs to Christ as Lord, and in which He takes up this person or that person to carry out His will. Ananias at first makes objections. The Lord says to him, "Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel". Christ in glory was to be preached by Paul to the gentiles, but the activity of the Lord towards Saul personally was to bring him into the reality and blessing of christian fellowship. It is a great thing now for a man to be separated from the contamination down here, so as to be a vessel sanctified and fit for the Master's use, for we have come to a time when only "the Lord knows those that are his".
In verses 26, 27 there is a point further. When Saul was come to Jerusalem he assayed to join himself to the disciples. But they were afraid of him. Then Barnabas
{242}
related how he had seen the *Lord* (not the Christ) in the way. All this shews the activities of the Lord. And Saul is a chosen vessel in whom He would shew His activities.
Then in verse 31 we get the disciples walking in the fear of *the Lord* and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, and being 'multiplied'. It is a beautiful picture of the effect of the activities of the Lord down here on earth. Now that is the end of that part. We have seen the activities of the Lord, and the purpose of them, not with regard to what transpires in the world, but in regard to His people and His own interests. What goes on in the world does not affect me, save that I ask, How is the Lord's testimony affected by it?
Now in the raising up of Aeneas (verse 33) we get a sample of the power of the world to come: "And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and *turned to the Lord*". It does not say were converted, but they turned *to the Lord*, they were affected.
Again, in verse 42 it is said, "many believed in the *Lord*". The effect of the Lord's activity through Peter in the raising up of Dorcas was that "many *believed in the Lord*". This activity of power shews that which will be in exercise in regard to the world to come, with the effect -- that "many believed in the *Lord*". It is connected with Peter and the kingdom.
Is it not a great comfort to know that the Lord can subdue now to Himself? He takes up often the most unlikely persons in which to exercise that subduing power; we are each and all a proof of it. He prepares instruments to do His work, and Ananias is an example of this.
How did it come about that the assemblies had rest from the persecutions they had been suffering through the hatred of Saul? Not by the crushing of the persecutor, but by taking him up in the subduing power of grace and making him an instrument of the Lord's own blessed activities; and right it was that the assemblies should have rest as the result of the Lord's gracious activity towards
{243}
the persecutor. We can walk in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit now. The Lord says, as to Saul, "I will shew him how great things he must suffer for *my* name's sake".
It was right that he should suffer, governmentally right, for he had made others suffer. The great apostle of the persecution was taken up and made a chosen vessel.
The Lord exercises His subduing power with regard to saints, that they may be brought into the reality and blessing of christian fellowship, and prepares us for any little bit of service in which He may see fit to use us. The assembly is to be now walking in the fear of the Lord -- finding the Lord a present reality; and our mainstay down here is the comfort of the Holy Spirit. It is a comfort that never can fail you. If you look for comfort only in texts of scripture, that may fail you; but the comfort of the Holy Spirit will never fail you. We have to look to it that we are found walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit. There will come a time when the powers of the kingdom will be made manifest by a general subjugation to the Lord. But *now* we have to say to the Lord in His blessed subduing power and administration. If you recognise that, you will desire to be a vessel sanctified and fit for the Master's use -- ready for any little bit of work which He may see fit to entrust to you.
{244}
THE DIVINE SIDE OF "IN CHRIST" AND ITS EFFECT IN THE SAINTS
@Ephesians 1: 1 - 23; @Ephesians 2: 1 - 10
Ques. In @2 Corinthians 5 "If anyone be in Christ, there is a new creation". That is a new order of things; do we get that here?
F.E.R. We get new created here. We are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus.
Ques. What is the difference between "in Christ" and "in Christ Jesus"?
F.E.R. "In Christ Jesus" is an expansion of "in Christ". Chapter 1 of Ephesians gives the divine side of the thought of "in Christ", that which is set forth of God in Him; chapter 2 gives our side, that is, the effect of God's work in us.
Rem. The first gives the counsels and purposes, and the second how God has wrought to bring us into them.
F.E.R. Exactly. The whole of chapter 1 speaks of the truth on the divine side, revealing what was eternally in the thought of God, and what God has brought to pass in Christ -- to head up all in Christ. That is the burden of the chapter.
Ques. You said this morning that "in Christ" was state. "In Christ Jesus" in verse 1 refers to "faithful"; is that the state of soul to enter into it?
F.E.R. It is the state of soul in which they could enter into it.
Ques. Is chapter 2 experimental?
F.E.R. Yes, in the sense of its being what God has wrought.
Ques. Counsels were in eternity and the work is in time?
F.E.R. Yes; but not only have we God's eternal counsel, but that counsel now comes out in Christ. The One in whom God purposed to effect all these things has
{245}
now come forth, and all has been effected in Him, and God has operated in Jew and gentile according to it. Nothing could be effected till Christ came. The counsels come into view in Christ. God does not operate in us till He has in principle brought all to pass for His glory in Christ.
Ques. "In whom also after that ye believed". How do you understand "in whom"? Is that in Christ?
F.E.R. I think that all in chapter 1 is on the divine side. It is God acting towards us in Christ, acting according to His counsel and sealing us to this end. Chapter 2 brings before us the operation of God which has set us in the place purposed. It is God's presentation to us of His will in Christ in chapter 1. Hence faith comes in, not new creation; so, too, forgiveness. "In whom" does not indicate exactly that Christ is the object of faith, but rather that God has acted towards us in Him. It is the divine side.
Ques. It is what we *have* in Him, not what we *are* in Him?
F.E.R. Yes, much more that. It is objective truth in the true sense in chapter 1. In Christ God presents Himself to us. All the 'in whoms' mean in *that Person* and God presenting Himself to us and acting for us in that Person. It is the special presentation of God to us.
Ques. Is that analogous to @2 Corinthians 1 "All the promises of God in him"?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. As many promises as are of God, in Him is the yea and in Him the amen. It is "unto Christ", not "*in* Christ" there -- attached firmly to and connecting us firmly with.
In @Ephesians 1 God presents Himself to us in Christ as the accomplisher of His purposes. Then chapter 2 shews the corresponding action in saints which puts them in Christ. We are made to sit in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus. I doubt if we get the idea of our being in Christ till we come to chapter 2.
Ques. That is where the riches of His grace is displayed?
{246}
F.E.R. Yes, that proves the truth we were having this morning that "in Christ" involves new creation.
Ques. Is chapter 2 realisation?
F.E.R. It involves realisation. It would be of no use to us if we did not realise it in Christ. I go fully with objective truth, only give me what is really that. Objective truth is the presentation of God in Christ -- of His own sovereign purpose set forth in Christ. It is not simply the purpose, but that it is set forth in the Person who is the vessel of purpose. God has set Him at His right hand. He is the Head of the church, His body, which is the fulness of Him that filleth all in all. It would not have been possible for us to enter into God's purpose had it not been set forth in a Man.
Rem. It is an immense thing to have it, but God has everything in Christ.
F.E.R. You must go to that side of things and that frees you from the influence of things on this side.
Ques. Verse 15. What is faith?
F.E.R. The christian is addressed on his normal ground. God addresses the christian as having faith, and love to all the saints.
Ques. Why is redemption introduced?
F.E.R. The passage looks at a christian as down here and details what he has in Christ according to the grace of God; he has forgiveness of sins and inheritance and the Spirit, the earnest of the inheritance. Chapter 1 shews what he *has*, chapter 2 what he *is*; the last is the more important. What he has is in a sense incidental.
Rem. Chapter 2 shews the fruit of the work of God in the believer.
F.E.R. The great point is this, God has wrought according to the counsel of His will, He has wrought to have us in heavenly places like His Son, and that opens up "in Christ". He has blessed us in the heavenly places in Christ. We are quickened, raised up together and made to sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus. You are to the praise of His glory down here *now*. I think that
{247}
is in the present, it is much as in @2 Corinthians 1 "unto the glory of God by us".
Ques. Is it not future in chapter 2?
F.E.R. Yes, "In the ages to come".
Ques. What is the force of that, "to the praise of his glory"?
Rem. I had always thought that was manifestation by and by.
F.E.R. It may be so, but I had rather thought it present. Stephen was here to the praise of His glory. Saints are to be to the praise of His glory. I do not know whether they always are. It is the consciousness of the inheritance.
Ques. What is glory?
F.E.R. I think God's purposes are His glory. He cherishes His purposes and is displayed in the accomplishment of them, and the christian who is in the light of His purposes is to the praise of His glory. It is a great thing to be to the praise of His glory. You reach it as Stephen did. Stephen had to realise baptism unto Christ's death -- to disappear. Up to Stephen things were in transition. In Stephen all closes; and he ends with death. The whole course of dealings with regard to Israel closed with Stephen, and as christians we begin where Stephen ended. We are baptised unto Christ's death, and are to be to the praise of God's glory. Everything that is to come out in display by and by is to come out morally *now*. So as regards the Jerusalem above, it is our mother, we are her children; that is, we have taken her character, it is to come out in us morally now. It is a saying, 'Like mother, like children', It is seen in a company of people formed by the testimony of the glory of the Lord.
Rem. Something akin to @2 Corinthians 3: 18, "beholding ... the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory".
F.E.R. That means something which makes us all alike. We are all changed into *the same* image from glory to glory indicating increasing moral elevation. We
{248}
know but little about christianity, and have but a poor idea of its power when first set up on earth. Saints had the power of it then, though not so much the intelligence; we have now the intelligence but not much of the power. We cannot return to the power, to that which was at the beginning; but even in recognising that the Holy Spirit is still here, we get great good. The remnant in Malachi could not go back to the Solomon state of things. If christianity could be set up as at the beginning, it would only fail again. It is a great assumption to imagine that we can set up a representation of the church. If we could, we should only break down. There was not, I judge, at the beginning any ecclesiastical formation, and I say that only in view of the immense importance of our going back to the power and the simplicity of the Holy Spirit.
Ques. What is church formation?
F.E.R. The assuming of the ground of the one body shews the idea of it. In Acts what had the saints outside the power of the Holy Spirit? There was nothing save the power of the Spirit. I have thought that you cannot understand the assembly if you do not see what Christ was with His own down here on earth. Then in Acts you see the effects of the presence of the Holy Spirit. The first time the Lord's supper was eaten, the Lord was present with the disciples, and there He touched their affections, and that is how it should affect us; the bread and wine recall Him in His death, as the expression of His affection -- and that brings Him in, present. For the moment you recall the love, you recall Himself. His death was a fact in the line of His love, but the love was there before the death, and it is unchanged after.
Ques. You say there was no church formation at the beginning, what then about bishops and deacons?
F.E.R. They were men full of the Holy Spirit. Church formation is that which man has wrought, not what God wrought. There is nothing ecclesiastical, save ruin, left for us, and all that we can do is to return to what is in the power of the Spirit. I see the importance
{249}
of this, and when you listen to the voice of the Spirit He gives you an insight into the Lord's present mind. He gives you to hear the Lord's voice to the angels of the churches, how *He* views them. All our hopes are centred now on the coming of the Lord, on the manifestation of the church in glory, that is the latter glory. It is useless looking back to the past glory.
Ques. When was the quickening which we get spoken of in chapter 2 effected in the saints?
F.E.R. I could not say. The apostle takes up a company of people and describes what has been effected in them. I do not think time is taken into account.
Ques. When should we come into it?
F.E.R. What is described goes very far; you are in association with Christ over Jordan -- consciously in association with Christ -- not in the land of Sihon and Og. The apostle looks at a company of people as having been in one state, out of which God had quickened them by His power into another state. You are quickened together *with Christ*; that is putting you into association with Christ in life.
Ques. Could that be said before realised in the soul?
F.E.R. If said of them without its being realised in the soul, it would be unreal. It is not said in the passage that Christ was quickened. It takes up Jew and gentile as dead in trespasses and sins, a state in which Christ never was, and they have been quickened together with Christ. You cannot be brought into association with Christ without realising it. I doubt that it can be said that when Christ was raised you were quickened; He was raised, but He was not exactly quickened; He was not made to live; *we* are made to live with Him.
Ques. Does not quickened together with Christ mean Christ was quickened?
F.E.R. Well, the statement as to Christ is distinct and is in chapter 1. He was raised, but we are quickened -- that is, made to live spiritually in Christ. Quickened together with Christ shews the manner in which God
{250}
will have us in heaven in association with Christ. It is not here the question of time, but of the manner of the thing. It is God's purpose to have us in heavenly places, but not without the blessed vessel of His purpose. But being quickened together with Him, you are clearly over Jordan.
Ques. Is this the riches of His grace?
F.E.R. No, it is rather "God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us". The idea of mercy involves sovereignty. It is not exactly the riches of His grace that takes you to heaven. It is His love. When it is a question of display, it is the riches of His grace. The grace which God will display in the church by and by will be such as to be a pledge of the security of the whole universe of bliss. God has given in the church such a witness of His grace that the saved nations will walk in the light of it. The kings of the earth bring their glory and honour unto it. If such grace is shewn forth there, then all are safe in the grace that reaches out to them. The thought is more of what God is going to make the church the display of, rather than of what He is to the church; the display is of grace rather than of love. Display has to do with grace. Love takes you to heaven, God's own habitation.
Rem. Grace, as shewn in the church, is a wonderful thought.
F.E.R. Yes, it is. It will satisfy the desire of every living thing. God will fulfil that desire in the church, the nations will be very happy in the light of it.
Ques. Does the new creation extend in us?
F.E.R. You may grow in the order of the new creation, but the new creation itself does not grow. It is perfect; you are in it, but you grow in it. A child is perfect as a child, but it grows to a man.
Ques. What was the anointing of the tabernacle?
F.E.R. God shewed by that that the whole system of the universe would eventually be established in the power of the Holy Spirit. It is a remarkable circumstance
{251}
that the tabernacle was anointed without blood. Israel was very short-sighted; in their failure they lost the glory, and it goes out beyond them to the nations. God says virtually, *You* have failed, now the earth shall be filled with My glory. We are in the light of it now, and so are to be to the praise of His glory. Everything of God is great, there is nothing small.
Rem. That explains chapter 3: 10.
F.E.R. I think so; that is now. As you are led into the knowledge of God's love you enter into it, the knowledge of the love that will have you in heaven enables you to enter into it. The way you enter into the consciousness of quickening is by affection. You learn that God's love is so great that He will have you in association with Christ in His own habitation, you are drawn into it by love, in learning that it is for the satisfaction of His love that you are to be there, and you find that you are with Christ. Nothing else will satisfy God, and nothing else will satisfy you.
Ques. Does "in Christ Jesus" involve position as well as state?
F.E.R. No; I think the expression refers to us abstractly. We are not taken into heavenly places as we stand, it is only as "in Christ Jesus" you go in. Nothing else will do for heaven. The person goes in, but only as in Christ.
Ques. How do you connect the prayer of chapter 3 with that?
F.E.R. The prayer in chapter 1 is as to apprehending what God has effected. In chapter 3 we see the practical working of it in us, it shews how what is spoken of here would work out in us. As quickened with Christ you get an entrance into divine things, in intelligence and love; and the practical working of that is that you are filled unto the fulness of God; and that is down here. When you are quickened with Christ -- made alive in Christ, you are not done with. It is then that you begin to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and
{252}
depth and height. You want to be strengthened in the inner man. You have only just begun when you are made alive in Christ. The great end is the sense of having a place in God's habitation, then you come out down here to be expressive of God.
In the end of chapter 2 we get the house of God on earth, His habitation through the Spirit; and what is the good of the house of God, if God is not seen in it? It is not the presence of a cloud now, it is God Himself there. The end of chapter 2 is the practical formation of state in us in order that God may be seen in us down here. Quickening is in view of taking us into His own habitation, in order that we should come out and express Him here. Everything that came out in Christ was to come out in the church; the church was to be the continuation of Christ, it was to be very attractive down here, so that men might be drawn out from the world. It will be attractive in the future day. The church was here as the vessel of testimony. The evangelist went out from the church; he must be hampered now to an amazing extent by the state of the vessel of testimony, but then he is himself part of it.
{253}
THE PLACE OF CHRISTIANS IN GOD'S WAYS
@Titus 2: 11 - 14
I desire to say a few words in connection with what has been already presented to us as to the place of christians down here upon earth.
I feel one thing, that we need to be much more individual. What I mean by that is, that we need to be more free in spirit from dependence on anything external: that is, upon association, and especially upon association that is peculiar; for our association is more or less peculiar. It is not normal. It is to a large extent owing to the existing state of christendom. But I think we want to be free from dependence on association, or on meetings, or on ministry. While we do not undervalue these things, and while, in a certain sense, the Lord may take account of a company, yet we do not want to take account of ourselves in that way, but as individuals. I cannot make out any defence of our position as a company. It is as individuals we have taken our stand outside the organisations that are accredited in christendom, and we have not done so in order to form a company. We may be found together as being of one mind and one judgment -- that would certainly be an effect of the truth upon us -- but we cannot set up to be a company or an organisation or anything of that kind.
Our path is peculiarly individual, and I would desire to see that maintained; I think a great many go on in dependence on what is to their eyes an organisation, or on meetings, or on ministry.
It has been said, and truly, if we are witnesses here to anything at all it is to the ruin of the church; and what is essential in this is, that every one of us should be in the faith of the place and should seek to be marked by individual fidelity. Nothing will compensate for the lack of that.
{254}
Another thing I want to touch upon is the place which the church has in the line of God's ways here upon earth. That is a very important point to distinguish. We have already had distinguished the place to which God has called us, and that which He has given us to occupy down here. You must distinguish between these, because when we are actually in the place to which God has called us -- that is, heaven -- we shall no longer occupy the place we now have down here. The two things are kept distinct in Scripture. It is very important to apprehend the place the church has in the counsels of God as unfolded in Ephesians; God's calling on high in Christ Jesus. But we want also to have a sense of the place in which we are set here in the line of God's ways on earth.
It is the place in which we are called on to prove our faithfulness; you must apprehend the place in order to be found faithful in the place.
I can illustrate this by any well-ordered household. My son might count it his greatest privilege to be in communion with his father, in concert with his mind, entering into his thoughts; but I might send my son to be a porter at the door, or anything else, and that is where he would prove his faithfulness. It is very much the same with us. God has called us to His eternal glory -- that is true; but we are set in a certain place in the course of things down here, and there we prove our faithfulness. That is where practical righteousness comes in, and that is what we have to look to.
One word I would say, if you do not know how to fill a small place you will never know how to fill a great place. We are not called upon to fill a great place here. There is a great place, and God has called us to it; but we have to do with small and few things down here, and in these we have to be faithful. They are the things suited to us in our present condition, because in that we are not equal to or fitted for great things. But in the small things we can prove our faithfulness.
It is no new thing that I am pressing. You will find
{255}
it in the history of God's people from the beginning. Take Abraham for an instance. Great things were made known to him; he was to be the heir of the world and all nations were to be blessed in him. These were large thoughts, but Abraham had to do with small things here; he was a stranger and a pilgrim, wandering about with no settled abode, no land to call his own here, no great things here; though in God's thoughts he had a large place. So with David. The greater part of his life was spent in suffering and conflict. He had to suffer and have patience before he came into the kingdom. I might go a point further; even with regard to the Lord Himself it was so. He was to go up into heaven to fill all things; everything is to be headed up in Him; but He says, "I have a baptism to be baptised with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!" He had to do here with suffering and disappointment -- with small things. He had to descend even into the lower parts of the earth before He went above to fill all things.
Paul will have a great place in the day of Christ, he will have a crown of righteousness, and yet, as we have already heard, he had to be a prisoner in bonds. In a sense the beginning of his apostleship was more glorious than the end. He had to be long a prisoner and in the end of his course he suffered martyrdom; but he had a great place in the counsels of God. So with the twelve, they will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel; but they had to do with small things and suffering here.
It is a great principle in connection with what we are down here, that we have to prove our fidelity in small things, and so no doubt we are prepared to enter into the great things which God has prepared for us.
Now in regard to what we have here in Titus: "The grace of God which carries with it salvation for all men has appeared", verse 11. We get a remarkable opening up undoubtedly of the ways of God. All is on the line of God's ways which anticipated this appearing; they were in view of that moment. It is impossible to go
{256}
through the Old Testament without seeing this. God was dealing outwardly on other principles with men, but we get glimpses of grace coming out continually in the Old Testament. When God clothed Adam and Eve with coats of skin, and so too in the figures and sacrifices under the law we get glimpses of it. And yet it had not appeared. Now it *has* appeared with its teaching to us.
But you get also the blessed end and issue of God's ways, the "appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ". So we are told elsewhere, "we ... rejoice in hope of the glory of God". That is what all is going onto, and it is a great point to apprehend that. It is a great thing in this world to know that the glory of God is going to appear. And in the glory of God everything that He has purposed will be brought to pass. When God shines out in the moral effulgence of what He is in Christ, that will bring all out in its train. God presents His grace now in the way of testimony, and allows this to go on, but all will issue in His glory. A world according to God will come into view that will be in the light of all that He is. It is the glory of God that will bring eternal life into this world. The glory of God is the end and issue of His ways; but it is a part of His ways that the grace of God has appeared *now* bringing salvation.
Well, what is the mind of God for us in regard to all that? You get it here: "Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world". And again, we read that Christ died to "redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works".
I would like just to touch on three things in the ways of God, which are realised, or are intended to be realised, in christians here on earth: first, a peculiar people, zealous of good works; secondly, the one flock of which Christ is the Shepherd; and thirdly, the house of God where God dwells.
{257}
These are not new thoughts. But the remarkable thing is that while christians have properly no place here, these things come out in them morally, and the value of this practically is very great in regard to us. We are left down here to fill up an interval. Israel is set aside for the time being, but the church has come in to fill up the interval; and, while things belonging to Israel are realised in us we look for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ -- for the moment when all that God has in view will be brought to pass.
Now in regard to "a peculiar people, zealous of good works"; that is not the height of our calling, I admit, but it is a great thing that we are left down here to *be* that. What do you learn in that? You get the practical setting aside of the workings of your will; you abide in Christ. The other side is, that Christ abides in us, and that is of the last moment, for if Christ abides in us His mind is in us. We have His view of everything. It is a wonderful thing that it should be possible to apprehend things according to Christ. Our tendency is to look at things according to the outward appearance, but it is a great thing to apprehend things according to Christ.
Then as to the flock. What is the gain of that? You follow the Shepherd, and in following the Shepherd you learn what the Shepherd is. That is the value to us. A flock is not exactly the height of God's thought as to us. There is no flock in heaven, but it is God's thought for us down here. Just as I might (to return to my illustration) set my son to something that is not exactly in the height of his position. But the flock is a great thing for us. To learn the goodness of the Shepherd in following Him is a great thing. The Lord says, "I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand".
Then in regard to the house of God. I quite agree in what has been said already this morning. It is the place
{258}
where God is known; and in the house of God you have boldness to enter into the holiest. And in the holiest you learn the resources of God. Christ is there, and all the resources of God in Him. That is the gain in the holiest. The ark of the covenant is there.
We are called to occupy that place in the ways of God here, and while it is a test of our fidelity, it is, on the other hand, of the greatest possible value to us, and the place which God has called us to occupy here is as much as we are equal to. As of old, God had a great place for one and another; the place they were called upon to occupy here was that suited to their then condition; and you may be sure that in our present condition the place we have to occupy is the place suited to us. It is important to see how this comes out in the ways of God down here. Until Christ came all was looking forward to the appearing of the *grace* of God; now this has come in, and we are looking forward to the appearing of the *glory*. And when the glory of God is displayed it will be set forth in the church; and the setting forth of God's glory there will be a great day for the world. The world will be filled with the glory of God. God is coming out in all His moral effulgence, and the glory of God will dissipate the darkness here. The church will come out as the vessel of that glory. God will shew in the church the exceeding riches of His grace. We are learning now, as affected by His grace, to live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world. We get instruction in the present time, that in the time to come God may be able to shew forth in the church the exceeding riches of His grace. That is the glory of the church. The church will come down having the glory of God, her light like unto a stone most precious.
Well, I just wanted to distinguish between the place to which God has called us and the place He has given us to occupy in His ways down here on earth. It is well to recognise it, and in that view it is most important to
{259}
understand what the issue of those ways is, namely, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ.
{260}
THE FEASTS (1)
@Leviticus 23: 1 - 14
In the early chapters of this book we have the "offerings"; they express the attitude of God towards the one who approaches Him by them. The flesh is there seen to be intolerable to God, and God will not have what is after it; He must get rid of the flesh. Afterwards in the 'feasts' we see how we can approach God, having learnt in the offerings His attitude towards us.
The feasts were institutions for Israel, but to us they represent formative principles, the means by which we are enabled to draw near. The chapters immediately previous bring out that man and all his doings are obnoxious to God, and that raises the question, how are we to be for God? It is by the formative work of the Spirit of God. Aaron had to go into the holiest covered by blood; man as such could not go in. Death was upon Israel which he represented, so Aaron had to go in with the witness of death. *Now* all must be by the Spirit of God.
The first seven chapters present, as has been said, the attitude of God consequent on the offering of Christ. The burnt-offering was for acceptance, the sin-offering for restoration. Sins were not put to account when there was no law, so that there was no sin-offering until the law. In the peace-offering we apprehend that the cause of disturbance has been removed from before God, so that man is free to enjoy such prosperity as God may give him down here. Then from chapters 12 to 15 we get an idea of the sources of defilement which are in the flesh, and this is seen even from the birth. Then after the day of atonement, in chapters 17 to 22, we learn that the ways of the people of God must be consonant with the holiness of Jehovah, who would have neither the doings of Egypt nor of the Canaanites.
We come then in chapter 23 to the feasts, in which we
{261}
can discern the principles by which we are formed for approach to God. The first great point in the formative work of the Spirit as illustrated in this chapter is the eating of unleavened bread; eating is appropriation, we begin with sincerity and truth. Then in the wave-sheaf is set forth in Christ risen the thought of acceptance for man, there is a point of rest for God. You begin with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth, and then you apprehend man in acceptance in resurrection. We learn the value of the passover after we have believed the gospel; it is one thing to learn the attitude of God towards us, and another to approach God in the value of that attitude.
The sabbath is brought in because the rest of God is the end of all His ways. If you had not a prospect of enjoying the rest of God, you would not entertain the idea of approaching God now. You cannot get out of the life of responsibility as long as you are down here, but there is something outside of and beyond the life of responsibility. It is very important to apprehend God's rest, to know what God has secured for Himself. There is for God a point of complacency, in spite of a world of moral confusion, and that is Christ. The offerings present Christ in death; the feasts are connected with a living Christ. God rests *now* in Christ, and we labour to enter into that rest. We get an idea of this in @Matthew 11, "Come unto *me* ... and I will give you rest". The great point now is to find the spot where God is complacent, and this He has in Christ. Christ came to finish the work of God, and *He is* the finish. The work of the Spirit of God in us now is to bring our souls into the apprehension of this rest. God could not find any place of rest after sin had come in till Christ came, and if we want to find rest it must be where God rests.
God's *activities* are shewn now in His ways and discipline with His people, but He wants to bring us to a point of rest, and unless we apprehend this we do not worship. People may praise God for His mercies, but
{262}
they will want more mercies tomorrow, but in Christ there is a point of rest where there is nothing more to desire. The first day of the week represents typically the heavenly brought into communion with the earthly. The sabbath is God's mercy to man down here, and it is a great point on the first day of the week -- which is to us a sabbath -- to relax every kind of work that is possible. As christians we come into the good of everything which God has provided for man; but in association with Christ, we reach a point of rest where there is the possibility of being before God, with all that is of the flesh excluded, that is the truth of a man in Christ.
The first principle of christian life is sincerity and truth; we have to eat the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. The sacrifice of the passover was, in the first place, for God, the unleavened bread was for the people. Having the Spirit, we must walk in self-judgment; the seven days of the feast represent the whole period of our time here. If there is not "sincerity and truth", we cannot maintain practical relations with God. Sincerity and truth are not found in any man until he is born again. No man "doeth truth" until he is born of God. Sincerity is that there is no kind of reserve on your part toward God.
In the feast of first-fruits we have come to the sanctification of the church, to the apprehension of our being set apart for God in the Spirit. The harvest is for God. We have acceptance in Christ risen, "As he is, so are we in this world". He is our righteousness. This settles every question. Everything unsuitable to God is excluded. It is not a question of how far we enter into it, but we are in acceptance in Christ risen. Christ is righteousness for us; if Christ risen is accepted for us, we cannot be under law. The apprehension in the soul of what Christ is as risen results in conformity to Christ, so that the purpose of God should be fulfilled in us. And this is accomplished in us now morally in the formative power of the Spirit. And
{263}
though leaven is seen in the two wave-loaves, yet they were offered to God as the first-fruits of the harvest.
THE FEASTS (2)
@Leviticus 23: 15 - 22
We have already seen that after a man has accepted the way of approach to God (the first man having been shewn to be set aside as regards God, from his birth), these institutions instruct us in the conditions under which the soul is qualified to draw near to God. You begin with keeping the feast of unleavened bread -- there is no reserve, no cherishing of the old leaven -- the corrupting principles. When you come to verse 9 of this chapter the whole ground is changed. All is now the other side of death. We get the idea of this in @Romans 7. You are married to Another, who is on the other side of death raised up, that you may bring forth fruit unto God. This is a great point for the soul to arrive at. You come to it in the feast of first-fruits, in which we see the beginning of God's harvest. What is to mark us *as responsible men down here* is sincerity and truth -- conformity with what has taken place at the cross, and many christians do not go beyond that, but this ends with our natural life here. "The grace of God ... hath appeared ... teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world"; but that is not the land of promise. We have to take account of ourselves not only as subjects of God's grace, but also of His *work*, and in the reality of this we are on the other side of death. The sheaf of first-fruits is waved for you, and you are joined to another; all is God's work, and you are bound to take account of yourself as the subject of God's work. What is true in Christ is made good in us by the Spirit of God. "Which thing is true in him and in you". The apostle brought the light of God's thought as to saints to bear upon the Galatians
{264}
to shew them their contrariety. It was little present good to them that they were "the sons of God", the apostle had to remind them of it, and brought the light of it to expose the folly and weakness of what they were going on with. They were hindering the work of God in them. It is a great thing to find that you are connected with the first-fruits of resurrection, and the question should be raised in our minds, how we can be in accord with Him who is raised up from the dead, and if we are this we shall not be in accord with the fashion and appointments of this world. All fruit for God must be from us as joined to the One who is risen; the secret of all fruit is that Christ is the spring. If there is any fruit it is of Christ, not of us. "From *me* is thy fruit found". The apostle looked at things morally, he saw what came out *in* the converts, rather than the converts themselves. Fruit is for God, service is towards men. All exercise of gift is manward. You bring forth fruit in your life. All testimony may be comprehended in one single word -- Christ; and the testimony of Christ is a sweet savour to God.
We come now to the two wave-loaves which were baken with leaven, and the fact of that necessitated a sin-offering, because man down here is represented in the loaves. At the day of Pentecost the church was not perfect; there was leaven there. It is not so with the heavenly city, there could be no sin-offering in connection with that. We want to apprehend in our souls what the church now is. Imperfection came in very early, but still there was a company set apart for God by the Holy Spirit, they formed the dwelling-place of God, were sanctified to God manifestly. The teaching of the two wave-loaves is unity. We understand but little of the unity of the Spirit, but it is a very important point. The Spirit in coming sealed a complete testimony of God's mind. Paul did not add anything to it, he expounded it. The house and the body were both there, and the gentile was brought in before Paul began.
It is interesting to read christianity in the feasts, we
{265}
see thus that when God was apparently giving the law, He was really foreshadowing christianity. It was a great day for any of us when we apprehended the unity of the Spirit. The unity of the Spirit remains though there be leaven, there is nothing perfect down here. The unity of the Spirit is a necessary consequence of the Spirit's *dwelling*. The Spirit is here to set aside practically the flesh; unity can only be brought about in the setting aside of the human will. The greatest obstruction to the work of the Spirit is man's will. Though there is failure, God has not given up the unity of the Spirit. The Spirit brings in the will of God, and so sets aside every man's will. The unity of the Spirit is a vital principle, and you have to take care that it is not marred through your will. A few people now gathered in a place does not necessarily constitute the assembly. We need in this day to go on upon low lines, we cannot assume to be anything. We have to go on with those who are in subjection to the truth. @2 Timothy 2. The truth is properly a bond between all christians; the one who is true clings to the truth, and the truth must hold saints together. Truth is the expression of things as they are rightly, so that everything is in the light. Christ is the truth, and the Spirit is the truth. You have the Spirit in you as the Spirit of truth. We may hold the truth in terms, but that is not the question. We have the truth in us by the anointing.
THE FEASTS (3)
@Leviticus 23: 23
The feasts were special occasions of Israel drawing nigh to God, but they are instruction for us in the ways of God. They indicate as to the moral teaching contained in them the course of the Spirit of God with us, leading us on to access to God. They open up the ways of God in connection with the earth. We see Christ risen in the sheaf of first-fruits, then the church in the two wave-loaves.
{266}
The day of atonement speaks of reconciliation and the feast of tabernacles of the consummation.
In verse 22 we have the Spirit of grace; the two wave-loaves were a pledge and token of the harvest. The church has that place. All the harvest is on the principle of resurrection. After the church there is a suspension in God's ways, and the first day of the seventh month is the resumption of God's dealings with Israel. They then come to the tenth day of the month, to the day of atonement, in which they have to afflict their souls, and then comes the rejoicing in the feast of tabernacles. A Jew is saved now on the principle of 'whosoever'. There is no special mission to the Jews *now*.
All is now established in Christ risen, the power of God began to be set forth in the resurrection of Christ. In the death of Christ there was the declaration of the love of God -- His power is declared in resurrection. In the Lord's supper we announce the Lord's death till He come, but when He comes, everything will be maintained on the same principles, He will bring in all that which has been declared in His death.
The blowing of trumpets refers to God's ways with Israel in the future. Most christians have reached as far as the two wave-loaves, and there they stop. You get the good of the new covenant in the house of God; people do not get further than the two loaves because they come under the influence of earth and its links. The blowing of trumpets signifies that God is demanding attention, and that leads to what is connected with the day of atonement, that is reconciliation, then you come on to the feast of tabernacles and new creation. The day of atonement is very important, but it brings with it that which we do not like, we must afflict our souls. It is the acceptance of death, not as relief, but as the putting off the body of the flesh. It is the refusal of yourself and of all that ministers to the flesh. You cannot get to the feast of tabernacles any other way. It is the end of God's ways, and it is the end at which we are to arrive; we get
{267}
in @John 7 full satisfaction, rivers of living water flowing from a full heart. The great point is to get to God's end. There are three grades of christians: (1) those who have reached the court of the tabernacle, (2) those who have reached God's house, (3) those who understand what it is to be of the company of Aaron and his sons. They serve the living God. @Philippians 3 answers to the feast of tabernacles for us, "our commonwealth has its existence in the heavens". We reach the feast of tabernacles there. The apostle reached that point through affliction -- the day of atonement -- we see this in the early part of the chapter, verses 7 - 10. Hence Paul could say, "our commonwealth has its existence in the heavens", in the full sense of the power and glory of the Lord; he had come to that point in his experience when flesh and everything but Christ was gone. For a long time Paul clung to the Jew, now all was gone. We have to suffer the loss of things here, as Paul did, that we may reach the reality of reconciliation. A man will never consent to the putting off of the body of the flesh until he has learnt what the flesh is, the terrible contrariety that he finds in himself to what is of God. Look at the order in @John 6 and 7. You have first the fellowship of Christ's death, and then the apprehension of His glory. Stephen had an apprehension of the feast of tabernacles, but he was prepared for it by death; rivers of living water flowed out from him.
The feast of tabernacles came when the vintage was over as well as the harvest; the vintage is the judgment on what has borne the name of God on earth. What marks the present time is that God is veiled, but in the feast of tabernacles the glory of the Lord fills the earth, it is displayed. The millennium will be the feast of tabernacles in outward display. We have to learn the lessons of the feasts now. Anyone who has not learned them knows really little of access to God; there is no other way of learning it. How can anyone approach God who is not rejoicing? Nor can rivers of living water
{268}
flow out from a man if he is not rejoicing. Stephen's face was as the face of an angel. You can reach rejoicing in no other way than by the day of atonement, and that means affliction of soul.
The new covenant is the bearing of God towards us; reconciliation carries with it the thought of what we are in Christ to God. It brings us to the rejoicing over the prodigal; they began to be merry, and we never hear of their leaving off. It is a wonderful thing when you see the heavens opened and the glory of God and Jesus, and have no sense of the flesh which encumbers. The glory of God and Jesus fills the universe of bliss. When you apprehend the glory of God and Jesus, you apprehend all God's ways, there is nothing beyond; Stephen saw it. Stephen's address (@Acts 7) showed how everything had failed that God had been in down here, but he saw the glory of God and Jesus -- a *Man* who could abide the glory. The "world to come" is a foreshadowing of what will abide, we have the Spirit of God to bring us into the good of it *now*. Stephen reached that point; afterwards Paul carries on the ministry from that point. Paul *declared* it and maintained it. The disposition ever since has been to drop down from that level -- the glory of God and Jesus, and the flesh all gone for God. God is waiting for the display of His glory; He has to veil it till He has that which is according to His glory.
The first great thought is that God has a Man who can abide His glory; then comes the church -- the heavenly city, and that is *of* Himself -- His own work, and thus it will abide His glory. There is glory to God in the church in Christ Jesus. The church is the medium for the display of the glory. The great point connected with the heavenly city is that it has the glory of God. No flesh can enter there, it is all glory.
Mount Zion represents the sovereign mercy of God, when man had forfeited all. When the ark was taken Israel's link with God was broken, but when the ark was brought back to mount Zion they say, "O give
{269}
thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever". As children we come under discipline but in sonship there is no discipline; when we know the place of sons, we have come to the place of rest.
{270}
CHRIST THE SON OF GOD
@John 1: 14 - 18, 29, 30, 43 - 51; @John 2: 1 - 11
I took up this passage as indicating that it is a point of the greatest importance to get a distinct and definite idea in regard to *Christ*. The great mainstay in christianity is *Christ*. I feel more and more that Christ is the immovable rock -- nothing is a real rock except Christ -- and what I want is to give two or three points which come out here in regard to Him. The more we know of Him the more likely we are to be kept, and we shall get enlargement of mind. If a man wants to be enlarged in mind, it will be by the knowledge of Christ. Some people say you get enlargement of mind by reading, and some men read a vast amount, but their minds do not get enlargement morally -- that consists in the knowledge of Christ. They go back, after all, to things which are after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. God brings before us what is after *Christ*. "In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily". Then you are likely to get great enlargement, morally as well as in mind.
The question is between Christ and the world, because in Christ God sets forth His glory, and the world is the scene of *man's* glory, where *man* seeks for glory, and hence the system of the world, in its very nature, must be antagonistic to God, because God alone is to be glorified. In Isaiah it speaks of the day of the Lord, but the point of it is that God *alone* is to be glorified in that day. He will not tolerate anything that does not bring glory to Him.
I am quite certain that no one would pretend that the glory of man is of God. You find very unrighteous and very wicked men glorified by this world, but a man would be very blind to think that could be of God. "Which receive honour one of another, and seek not
{271}
the honour that cometh from God only". There is a great deal of honour in the world, but no one could think there was any honour from God. No one, as I said, can gainsay that on the one hand, God sets forth His glory in Christ -- that which has, and will, come to pass in Him -- and that, on the other hand, the world is a system of things where man has glory, but not from God. Therefore Christ and the world are antagonistic. The world has been tested by Christ, and now the spirit of antichrist is in the world, but this did not appear until Christ came. The apostle John says, "even now are there many antichrists". The system of the world will find its head in antichrist himself; who is yet to come. Apostasy is turning away from all revealed truth; it paves the way for antichrist, but the point is, there are many antichrists *now*. You find men denying the Father and the Son, and you find scepticism with regard to revelation. There was none of this until Christ came. All the spirit and power of antichrist is working down here to set aside, if possible, the idea of God.
There are two lines taken by the spirit of antichrist, the first is the denial that Jesus is the Christ, and the second is the denial of the Father and the Son.
There may be progress of a certain kind in the world as it is, but exaltation and honour in the eyes of man is only a proof that the world must be antagonistic to God and His glory. I can understand the statement of James, "Whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God".
Now, beloved friends, we are in the world, and we are liable to be affected by the influences about us, and the great question in regard to each one of us is as between Christ and the world. We cannot have the two -- they are absolutely antagonistic. Christ is the Head and centre of another world, and it is impossible for a man to have his heart in both worlds. Faith always connects itself with the world to come. God gave to men in the world, here and there, light as to the world to come, and
{272}
all the light which God gave referred to the world to come, which is put under Christ.
I now come to the passage I have read. I assume that all here would admit that Christ is the Son of God. That is the point of the gospel of John. "These [things] are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God". @John 20: 31. "I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God". @John 1: 34.
I will just distinguish the gospels. In Matthew, Christ is spoken of as the Son of David, the Son of Abraham, the Son according to promise. In Mark, He is the Son of God, God's Servant. In Luke, He is the Son of man; and in John, the Son of God in all the greatness of His Person. Matthew and Luke present Christ under what I may call official titles, but in John the great point is the Person of the Son of God. So in chapter 2 the Lord says, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up". He spake of the temple of His body -- God was there.
In the chapter I have referred to, you get the Son of God spoken of in three lights, and you get what I may call the climax in the beginning of chapter 2 (Read verses 17, 18, 33, 34, 48, 49.) These three passages are before me because they give us what is characteristic of the Son of God. Each presents the Son of God to us in a very distinct light, and we have to take in the whole to get the complete thought.
First, He declares God. If He be the Son of God, in the very nature of things He declares God. He comes from God, and He declares God. God has come out in Him.
In the second passage you get another thing -- He baptises with the Holy Spirit; that is, He brings in the influence of the Holy Spirit to bear upon man in connection with the testimony, and in the third passage, in connection with Nathanael, He is privy to all the exercises of His people.
My object in speaking is to put these three thoughts
{273}
together, to make them centre in the Son of God, and you get the consummation in the beginning of chapter 2; I will touch upon them in detail.
In the first, you see Christ contrasted with Moses -- "The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ". "Grace and truth" were not *given*, they *came to pass* by Jesus Christ. No *man* could exercise grace and truth towards man; it could not be by the law and the prophets, but grace and truth came to pass by Jesus Christ, and the secret of it is given, "No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him".
That which marks the present time is that God is declared, all the mind of God is declared, and everything is based on that great fact. God is love, and we have got the perfect expression of divine love in Christ. "God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us". Until the gospel came into the world, man had no idea of love. If you search for it amongst the ancient Greeks, you will not find it; all man's notions of love were completely debased, there was no true thought of love.
Now, Christ has *declared God*. What could be greater? Whatever the Son of God came to do, the greatest thing was to declare God. I am not insensible to the greatness of redemption, but what transcends all is that *God is declared*. God is now in the light of declaration. John says, "God is light, and in him is no darkness at all", and "If we walk in the light, as he is in the light," @1 John 1: 5, 7. God has come out according to His own nature, because the Son has declared Him.
We are brought into the light; it is a wonderful moment when the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts, and we are really in the light of God. "In him is no darkness at all". "God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us".
The next point is in connection with the Spirit -- that He baptises with the Holy Spirit. It was indicated to
{274}
John the baptist that upon whom he should see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, the same was He that would baptise with the Holy Spirit, and John adds, "I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God".
Now, beloved friends, I want to dwell a little more fully on this. It was a wonderful thing that had come to pass that there was a Man down here on whom the Spirit could come to *abide*. We read of the Spirit coming upon men, upon Samson, for instance, but He did not abide on them. On *Christ* He descended and *abode*.
"He which baptizeth with the Holy Spirit" I understand to mean that Christ is to bring all under the influence of what God is, that is the result of Christ's coming into the world. He was the anointed Man, and He was the beginning of things for God. The starting point of the ways of God, in that sense, was Christ anointed with the Holy Spirit. In this way the whole order of things was altered. Who could bring that about -- who could baptise with the Holy Spirit -- but the Son of God? In this chapter it is the *Person* who is before us, the One who is competent to declare God and to baptise with the Holy Spirit.
Beloved friends, everyone would admit that the beginning of all things in God's world is the anointed Man. All began with Christ, and, in that sense, He is the Head of every man, and then there is another thing -- He accomplished redemption. He takes up all the liabilities of man and settles them. Further than this, He is the last Adam, the quickening Spirit, who baptises with the Holy Spirit. Who but the Son of God could accomplish all this?
Now with regard to the third point (verses 43 - 51), the Son of God was recognised here by Nathanael, and He was privy to all the exercises through which Nathanael was passing. "When thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee". It is in the same way we get the conviction
{275}
of the truth -- it is in this way I am searched by Scripture. I am searched and known. We are not told what passed under the fig-tree, but what was brought home to Nathanael was that he was searched -- Christ was privy to all his exercises. He knew Nathanael individually, and his individual exercises. Nathanael was known to the Lord.
Then there is the response -- "thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel".
We get from it all, the great thought connected with the Son of God that He is privy to all the exercises through which men pass with regard to God. God knows how to bring about exercise in man. There is a variety of ways in which God speaks to man -- by sickness, by circumstances; God has His own way, and men pass through exercise as the effect of the work of God. But the Son of God is privy to all the exercises -- as He said to Nathanael, "when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee", and it is blessed when the response comes, "thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel".
Now, beloved friends, I want to put these three things together -- they are very simple -- He declared God, He baptises with the Holy Spirit, and He is privy to the exercises of man. All this gives us a great idea of the Son of God. Just think of the competency of Christ to declare God, and that He should have the Spirit of God, so to speak, at His command to baptise with. The Holy Spirit is content to become the servant of Christ.
And, further than this, that He should see all that is passing in the soul of man with regard to God! The Lord says of Nathanael, "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!" He was a true Israelite, there was no kind of concealment, nothing hid, all was naked in the presence of God, and it is such a one who can give the suitable response, "thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel".
In the end of the chapter His official title also comes
{276}
out, "Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the *Son of man*". There is no doubt whatever that Christ is pointing on to the kingdom, when communion will be established between earth and heaven, when all will be put under the Son of man, according to @Psalm 8. The church will have a very great place in connection with that, as we see in "the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven".
Now in chapter 2 we see the Lord acting here in the power of resurrection ("the third day"). That assumes that redemption has been accomplished. That is the meaning of God acting in the power of resurrection.
In the world to come, resurrection is the great principle. Israel is revived, and the nations are revived; everything in the world to come will be revived towards God. Christ was the true Israel -- "I ... called my son out of Egypt" -- and He was a light to the gentiles. The restoration of Israel is life from the dead -- the great principle on which God acts -- the power of resurrection can come in because redemption has been accomplished.
Now, in this second chapter, Christ turns the water of purification into wine -- "wine which gladdeneth the heart of man". The water of purification, in the power of Christ, really becomes the means of cheering the heart of man. The great hindrance to a man's joy is himself. I find out that I have not done with myself; I find that I myself have a certain place, and it is a great hindrance to my joy. Hence a christian has to become like a little child -- of no importance in his own eyes. I feel there is a vast amount of joy there for me, and I cannot enter into it because I have a certain importance in my own eyes. I am not prepared for the complete setting aside of myself. You want the water of purification in order to be purified. What from? From all importance in your own eyes, and from the world. When a man is purified from importance in his own eyes, he is purified from the world. The world is the scene of moral impurity, and if
{277}
there is any affinity between me and the world, I am not purified from myself; or ready to be exposed in all that is in myself by purification, so that I may judge myself as of no account in my own eyes.
It is the practical putting-out of self; and of all that belongs to it. What for? To make room for God. God will not meet you on your own terms; you have to get down to the bottom. God's terms never make anything of you or me. You get down to the lowest point, and then when the water of purification has taken effect, joy comes and fills you. No one gets real joy from oneself or the world, but when one comes down, then the water of purification becomes the wine of joy in the knowledge of God and of what God's disposition is towards us. It all lies in the consciousness of what God is for us, in perfect consistency with the sense of nothingness in oneself:
<blockquote>'O keep us, Love divine, near Thee, <br>that we our *nothingness* may know'.</blockquote>
The light of God and His love brings one to the sense of one's own nothingness, then the water of purification is effectual, and there is joy and delight in the knowledge of God. The water of purification, in the power of resurrection, becomes the wine of joy.
All this will find its complete fulfilment in the millennium. Nathanael represents a true Israelite according to God. What comes out in chapter 2 is what Christ will effect in Israel. First, they will be purged from themselves and the contamination of the world, and then, because redemption is accomplished, the water of purification will be turned for them into the wine of joy -- there will be the feast of tabernacles.
This is all bound up with the Person of the Son of God. It is a great thing to get the apprehension of Christ in the light of His Person, and of what is characteristic of the Person. He declares God, He baptises with the Holy Spirit, and He is privy to all the exercises of man. It is very wonderful that each of us who are christians is known by the Son of God, that we have come under the
{278}
baptism of the Spirit, and that He knows every exercise of our souls. "I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine, as the Father knows me and I know the Father".
Now, beloved friends, we have God declared, and the Spirit given, and the witness and proof of it is that "The Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life".
{279}
CHRIST IN CREATION AND REDEMPTION
@Colossians 1: 12 - 23; @Revelation 4: 11; 5: 9
It is extremely important, beloved friends, to look at everything in the light of the coming day. The fact is, in christianity you continually anticipate the coming day.
The "day" is not come yet -- the darkness is passing, but the true light has not yet come. The tendency of christendom at the present time is to fall away from revealed truth. Revealed truth has not the place in the estimation of man that it had, and the tendency is to fall back from it into the traditions of men and the rudiments of the world. All these things might have had a place until revelation came in, but revelation dissipates all the darkness. Now people are falling away from revealed truth. This cannot fully come to pass as long as the Spirit of God is here, but the principle of apostasy is at work. There are many antichrists even now, and it is the last time.
Such being the case, it is extremely important that our souls should be found in the light of the day that is coming, because "If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable". We have to hold fast until the day comes, and not to be moved away from the hope of our calling.
I want to speak of the coming day in connection with Christ. When you come to the church, it is the first-fruits of the ways of God. You get Christ risen, and the church sanctified by the Holy Spirit -- the beginning of the ways of God -- the wave-loaves, all leading up to the feast of tabernacles. I refer to the day of the coming of the Lord, which will bring in the day of the Lord -- then the feast of tabernacles will be established, which is a time of rejoicing. There was no rejoicing in the other feasts, but only in connection with the feast of tabernacles. It is the light of the coming day which brings joy. Christians
{280}
rejoice when their souls come into the light of the corning day. When we can rejoice always in the Lord, it proves that the heart is really in the light of the day that is coming, the day of the Lord.
Now, beloved friends, in the passage in Colossians which I read, all has reference to the Son of God's love. It does not state things in the same way as in Ephesians. These are not the things which are given to you, but what properly belongs to Him, the Son of the Father's love. "Who has delivered us from the authority of darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love". Then we get a good deal predicated of the Son of His love in connection with taking up "all things". "All things" are taken up on two grounds -- first on the ground of creation, and then on the ground of reconciliation. These correspond with the two passages I have read in Revelation, "Thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created," while in chapter 5, the same things are taken up on the ground of redemption.
Now, beloved friends, we often talk of the world to come -- we are more accustomed to talk about it than formerly. The world to come is extremely important. Sometimes we speak of it as another world -- well, morally it is another world. This world has been built up on man departed from God, and the world to come is built up, so to speak, on Christ, and it is another world morally. As to the principles prevailing in the world to come, they are in the strongest contrast to those in this world. The principles of this world are the "lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life", but those of the world to come are righteousness and the love of God.
In this world, the moral source of everything is the devil, while, in the world to come, the moral source is God. You cannot conceive a greater contrast. Therefore we are justified in speaking of it as another world. Yet, after all, we get certain things taken up which have belonged
{281}
to this world. You get the expression "all things" several times in Colossians and also in Revelation. "Thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they *are*, and were created". What was created? "All things". "All things" belong to this world, but they are taken up by Christ -- they come under another Head, they are brought on to another ground. They are taken up, as I said, on the ground of creation first, and then on the ground of reconciliation. In both passages I have read you get the expression "all things". In heaven and earth all things were created by Christ and for Him, and He has "made peace by the blood of his cross". All is brought out in connection with reconciliation, while *we* get the present application given to us, "You ... *now* hath he reconciled". We have to wait for the reconciliation of all things, but now it is said of us, "You ... now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy, and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight".
Now, beloved friends, I come back, for a moment, to the subject of creation. He is the pre-eminent One in regard to everything created -- "All things were created by him, and for him". If you follow that out it gives a remarkable character to the Old Testament. You find there a vast number of things set up in the hand of man -- thrones and dominions and governments. Dominion was given to Adam over all creation. Then if you pass on to the time of the flood, God entrusted to Noah the sword of government, and later still God established the throne of David. Then another thing comes out in connection with David -- you get the headship of the gentiles. There are many things in the Old Testament I have not referred to, but I have just taken up these familiar ones.
Now all these things which were put under the hand of man failed, as we see, first of all, in Adam. So, too, the sword of government was entrusted to Noah, but Noah failed. God also had promised to establish David in the throne of Israel, but David failed in it, although dominion
{282}
was revived in Solomon, who also failed.
It gives great interest to the Old Testament when you apprehend that all things were created by Christ, and for Him, as in Colossians, while Revelation expresses it, "For thy pleasure they are and were created". Now mark this -- "He is before all things, and by him all things consist". The different things I have referred to in the Old Testament all came in successively -- the throne of David followed the sword of government, and the sword of government followed the dominion given to Adam. You find the truth of all this brought out in the Old Testament, but these things were never connected, they never "consisted", or stood together. Now Christ is "before all things, and by him all things *consist*" -- all are gathered together in Him. God has made known the mystery of His will, to gather together in one all things in Christ. So, beloved friends, dominion is in the hand of Christ -- government and thrones are in the hand of Christ. The angel said to Mary, "he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever". So, too, He is the Head of the gentiles. This comes out in @Psalm 2 -- "Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion, ... Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee, ... Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession".
Thus all these things are taken up in Christ, and it gives great interest to the Old Testament when you study it, and see that all that God has established from time to time was created in view of Christ, and also created by Him. Hence when the Son of God becomes Man, He takes up all as Man, and on the ground of creation. "For thy pleasure they are and were created".
Now when Christ takes up all things, He finds man in possession, and man has to be dispossessed. When the Lord comes, He will not consider the rights of man at all. All that is of man will be entirely swept aside, and everything will be taken up on the ground of creation. Man has no rights except providential rights. *We* have to respect
{283}
the providential rights of man, but *Christ* will not respect them. He will sweep aside every such right, and take up all things on the ground that "all things were created by him, and for him: ... and by him all things consist". I regard it as very important, beloved friends, to apprehend the ground on which Christ takes up all things according to God. He is "the first-born of every creature, ... and by him all things consist".
Now we will pass on in the passage in @Colossians 1 to verses 18 - 22. In these verses you get an entirely different thought brought in, just as in @Revelation 5, everything is taken up on the ground of redemption, and blessing and glory and honour are ascribed to Christ on that ground. Here in Colossians everything is taken up on the ground of reconciliation. This, so to speak, is collateral with what we have in Revelation.
All creation was the handiwork of God, but it did not *reveal* God. @Psalm 19: 1. Men had the witness of creation, but it did not bring to light God's nature and character. Now, beloved friends, the Son of the Father's love has *revealed* Him. The most important fact that has come to light is that He has *revealed* Him. That is what I understand by "all fulness" dwelling in Christ. The Father was revealed and all the light of God came out in Christ for the first time. In the Old Testament, God interfered with the affairs of the world continually, although men were not willing that He should, but we do not get God *revealed*. "No man hath seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath *declared* him".
I spoke on a previous occasion of two things in connection with the Son of God -- He declares God, and He baptises with the Holy Spirit. All the truth of God had come to light in Christ. One great truth is established in the Old Testament -- "There is one God", and in the New Testament -- "God is one". The Lord says, "I and the Father are one". "In him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily", and in that light men have to walk.
{284}
Now there is another truth -- He has "made peace through the blood of his cross". By the death of Christ all moral confusion has been removed from before the eye of God -- not yet from man's, but from the eye of God. All was brought to an end in the death of Christ, by the removal of the man by whom all the confusion came in. "By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin". That man was removed and Christ "made peace by the blood of his cross".
Put these two things together -- God revealed and man removed, they are two great things which come out in the death of Christ. "He made peace by the blood of his cross" in order to "reconcile all things unto himself". He brings everything, so to speak, into divine complacency by Himself taking up everything. That is the great scheme of reconciliation, that all things that God has established on earth will be brought under divine complacency by Christ's taking up all things -- the One who "made peace by the blood of his cross". Christ takes things up, not simply on the ground of creation, but also of redemption. He has made peace, and the practical result is that one Man is substituted for another. The one who brought confusion into the world had to be removed, and instead there was the Man who brought in God's glory.
If He had taken up things exclusively on the ground of creation, which of us would have part in it? By the very fact of His being the "image of the invisible God", which of us would be suitable? We should all be excluded. But He takes them up also on the ground which admits man; that is, beloved friends, Christ has come in to accomplish redemption, to take up the liabilities of man, in order that man may have a part with Christ.
What practically results is, "Death is swallowed up in victory". Why? Because Christ has annulled death, and there will be no more curse. There is the curse at the present time, but Christ was made a curse. Christ has taken up every liability which lay on man, that man may
{285}
get his part. He takes up all on the ground of reconciliation. You get the same principle in @Revelation 4 and 5 -- "redeemed us to God ... out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation".
Now, beloved friends, all that is going on now is in anticipation of that. All is there before God in Christ. If we had discernment enough to look up and behold the glory of the Lord, we should see that all the promises of God are in Him -- the yea and the Amen, to the glory of God by us. Just as far as we are under the power of the Spirit all these things are true in *our* eyes, and not only true before God; and if they are true in our eyes, we shall walk in the light of the coming day.
Man, in a kind of way, *likes* confusion. A very painful circumstance occurred when Christ cast out the legion of demons. They "besought him to depart". They would rather have confusion than Christ. A great many people now would rather have confusion as it is than have the light of God brought to them. I think men very much prefer the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life to everything being dominated by God, but a christian would not be prepared for matters to be left in that way. Stephen, for example, "looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus". "*We* see Jesus, ... crowned with glory and honour", and all put under Him, in the light of the coming day. We are brought into the light of the day of reconciliation. What for? That we may be presented "unblameable and unreproveable in his sight" -- that is to say, Christ has been pleased to bring about a worshipping company of which He Himself is the Head and centre.
You get an allusion to this in @Psalm 22, but the company there does not go beyond the remnant of the Jews. Now, Jew and gentile are together, reconciled unto God "in the body of his flesh through death".
This is all vitally important, because if we are "unblameable and unreproveable in his sight", it means we are according to His glory, and to live irreproachably
{286}
we must be according to His glory, and those who are associated with Christ must be according to that glory in order that God may rest there. It is not possible that God should rest where all is not according to His glory. You get a beautiful picture of it in the new Jerusalem, where all is according to His glory. Some say we are not "holy and unblameable and unreproveable" yet. That is true, but you and I can enter into the mind of Christ with regard to us. He 'presents' us so that God may rest in us, because all is according to His glory.
There are many things in us that offend the eye of God. Many people wonder why their circumstances are so trying, but the thing is, every child comes under discipline. I am a very poor hand at dealing with my children -- a very faulty father. I do not subject my children to discipline as I should, but God proves us in His love, and disciplines too. "His eyes are over the righteous". "You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities" @Amos 3: 2. In divine love the Father does not overlook what is offending; He deals with it in love.
The power has come in by which saints can be before God here, and the flesh excluded. Christ has reconciled us to that end, that everything that is contrary may be excluded, and that we may be in a sphere where divine love can rest in perfect complacency.
Now, beloved friends, we anticipate the coming day, and in the coming day the church will have its place as a great worshipping company. We cling to the true Aaron. He covers us, so to speak, in the presence of God. But in the coming day the church is to come out from God. "I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven", "that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, having the glory of God".
That God will be presented in the church is the great triumph of grace -- "That in the ages to come he might shew the *exceeding riches of his grace* in his kindness toward
{287}
us through Christ Jesus". It is God's triumph above all the power of evil which brought confusion into the world.
Beloved friends, do not let the world occupy your attention. Let your attention be diverted from this world, and the things of this world, and let it be directed to God's scene, where there is no confusion, and where the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, have no place. Christ, in that scene, is the Sun of Righteousness, and He fills all things with the light of reconciliation, and with the warmth of love. That is what fills the world to come. All is taken up in Christ, that God may fill all things. "*You ... now* hath he reconciled". There is a worshipping company where all answers to God, where all is in its proper place, where everything answers to the glory of God, and there is nothing which offends His glory. That is the place of the church.
Now, beloved friends, God keep our hearts in the light of the coming day, when all things will come under the Son of man!
{288}
THE APPROACH OF GOD TO MAN IN THE GOSPEL
@Romans 1: 1 - 17
Rem. I believe the thought was to have a slight outline of the subject of the epistle, and not to go through it in detail. I suppose, in a general way, it is the approach of God to man with the gospel.
F.E.R. I think so. I think it is the revelation of God in such a way as to establish a moral foundation in the soul of man. That is the great object of God's approach to man, and it is in that way that the kingdom is established.
Ques. How is there a moral foundation established in the soul?
F.E.R. The first great thing is to admit the necessity
Ques. In what sense is Romans a treatise on the gospel?
F.E.R. I do not know.
Ques. Well, please explain a little. Is it for the establishment of those to whom Paul wrote, or is it to set forth his own commission?
F.E.R. The former, I think. His object is to establish them in the truth of the gospel. It supposes the gospel is made known. He connects the way in which God is pleased to reveal Himself with what comes out in the gospel.
Rem. If you would develop for us how God lays a moral foundation in man's soul, it would be helpful.
F.E.R. What appears to me is that you get the truth in Romans of the righteousness and faithfulness of God. The righteousness of God is really established in grace, and, at the same time, His faithfulness is made known in connection with His sovereign mercy -- the two great principles of man's knowledge of God.
Rem. In order to know God and His nature.
{289}
F.E.R. Quite so.
Rem. That knowledge man had totally lost.
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
Ques. To lay a foundation in the soul, is it necessary to do more than believe things?
F.E.R. Well, I think most things come to you by faith, in a way, but I think that what a man believes has to be made good in him. *Believing* is not the establishing of a thing, but God establishes you in what you believe.
Rem. By the Spirit.
F.E.R. Yes.
Rem. That is the point of verse 11.
F.E.R. Yes, it clearly shews that more was needed.
Ques. You said the kingdom was established?
F.E.R. The kingdom of God is righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. You have to accept the kingdom in faith, but you also need to be established in it.
Ques. As a present fact?
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. Why is faith mentioned so frequently in the epistle up to chapter 5 and then not so often towards the end?
F.E.R. All the first part of the epistle is the light of God coming in, which is apprehended by faith. After that, you have the work of God, by the Spirit, in chapters 6, 7 and 8. It is another side of truth.
Rem. That is laying a moral foundation.
F.E.R. I think so. It is making good that which is presented by the Spirit.
Ques. In speaking of faith, is it the ability given of God to receive the revelation He has been pleased to make?
F.E.R. Not quite. A man's faith never goes beyond what he believes.
Ques. Do you distinguish between faith and believing?
F.E.R. No; I think believing is faith. I cannot tell *how* a man believes, but I doubt if a man goes beyond
{290}
*what* he believes.
Ques. But what he believes goes beyond his faith?
F.E.R. No. What there is for him to believe -- the revelation -- may go beyond a man's faith. I think that desire for a moral foundation must precede the acceptance of the testimony. A man must be born again to see the kingdom of God.
Ques. Then, in connection with what you say, a man only has faith in what he believes. Do you not think there is a desire created for more?
F.E.R. It is the grace of God operating through faith. It is all on the principle of "he that hath, to him shall be given".
Rem. "The true light now shineth", but a man may not have been brought to a full apprehension of the light.
F.E.R. Light and faith are commensurate with us.
Rem. Many a man may believe that certain things are true, but they may not be light in him, so you could not call it faith. Faith is what a man has as light from God in his soul.
F.E.R. Faith represents what light man had from God. The revelation of God is in Christ. To Abraham, Moses, David and others God gave light, but "the true light now shineth". We have the true light now shining in Christ.
Rem. So until there is the knowledge of God thus revealed there is no moral foundation in the soul. The Spirit builds upon it for God.
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
Ques. Would you distinguish between faith and trust?
F.E.R. You cannot trust until you believe.
Ques. Would you speak of faith as being progressive?
F.E.R. Yes. "Your faith *groweth* exceedingly". "Faith cometh by hearing", and therefore it is exceedingly important to get the presentation of the truth. It is not exactly by the work of God; faith comes by report, and report by the word of God.
Rem. Faith is as much the gift of God as light.
{291}
Rem. Our responsibility is to take heed what we hear.
Rem. And not reject it.
F.E.R. I do not think I would go so far as to say you are responsible to believe it, but if you do not believe it, you make God a liar, and that is very serious.
Ques. Is it a special gift of faith in @1 Corinthians 12?
F.E.R. It is faith to remove mountains. You see certain people, servants of the Lord, who are not stopped by anything -- they remove mountains. Nothing counts as a difficulty to them.
Ques. Is that a special gift, apart from what we generally speak of?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
Ques. Is there an intentional contrast between "according to the flesh", and "according to the Spirit"?
F.E.R. It indicates the line of divine dealings. All now is according to the Spirit of holiness. In the glad tidings of God concerning His Son, the line is the Spirit of holiness, and not the flesh.
Ques. How do you connect the faithfulness of God and His sovereign mercy in chapter 11?
F.E.R. There are two things you meet with in the world: one is the existence of sin, and the other is the scattering of Israel. These two things apparently compromise the character of God.
Rem. The existence of sin is universal.
F.E.R. Yes. The presence of death makes it patent to every one that the reign of sin is universal, and there is also the patent fact of the scattering of Israel. Both these facts tend to compromise the character of God. God comes out in grace and establishes righteousness, and His faithfulness comes out in connection with the principle of sovereign mercy. "The gifts and calling of God are without repentance". If the soul of a believer is established in the righteousness and faithfulness of God he has got a good foundation. He will not very readily be shaken.
{292}
Rem. It is not merely that, in Christ, God acted in righteousness in removing sin, but He established righteousness. In the end of chapter 5 we get the great fact that "by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life". One accomplished, subsisting righteousness has been established.
Rem. In @Psalm 40 righteousness and faithfulness come together.
F.E.R. They are established in the righteous One. Faithfulness supposes some previous promise. I think the great principle is "The gifts and calling of God are without repentance". God has been pleased to take up His people Israel. He has made certain promises connected with them which seem to have failed, and all this appears to compromise His character. The great answer to it, on the part of God, is *Christ*.
Rem. In Abraham the promise was given before the question of righteousness was raised -- i.e., in the law.
Rem. The establishment of righteousness is very far-reaching, as the basis of the new heavens and the new earth.
F.E.R. Exactly -- it is the principle of the new heavens and the new earth.
Ques. What is righteousness?
F.E.R. That which is *right*.
Ques. Will you beat it out a little for us?
F.E.R. That is scriptural. It is the basis on which God can carry on His work -- holiness involves it. To speak of the righteousness of God involves the assertion of His tights.
Rem. In the new heavens and the new earth, righteousness will dwell.
F.E.R. Exactly; it comes in after the solution of the question of good and evil. The righteousness of God existed before ever evil came in.
Rem. That brought to light God's righteous judgment.
Rem. That is only a part of God's righteousness.
{293}
F.E.R. It is not exactly a *part* of God's righteousness. Man, being lawless, comes under the righteous judgment of God. Man does what he likes -- he does not admit God's righteousness, and he comes under God's righteous judgment.
Ques. Where is the righteousness of God established?
F.E.R. In Christ. Christ is the righteous One, but the purpose of God is to establish righteousness in *me*, and so I submit to the righteousness of God. "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth".
Ques. I suppose the righteousness of God embraces more than in chapter 1: 17?
F.E.R. It is a pity to bring the judicial element into God's righteousness.
Rem. I think the stress is on *God's* righteousness.
Rem. The opposite of *man's*.
F.E.R. Yes. "I the Lord speak righteousness, I declare things that are right". @Isaiah 45: 19. The righteousness of God is established in the righteous One, but the question is, how can *you* touch the righteous One? How are *you* to be brought into relationship? How do you stand in relation to the Sun of Righteousness when the judgment of God is upon you? The answer is that the judgment has been borne by the righteous One, and you are righteous as He is righteous. We are accustomed to think of righteousness as established in the *work* of Christ. We are brought into relation to the Sun of Righteousness Himself. I remember writing to a brother who is now with the Lord, and telling him about a meeting in London on righteousness, and he said, 'You must take account of the *righteous One*. Many talk about righteousness as the effect of the work of Christ, but they leave out the "*Sun of Righteousness*".' "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness", and you have righteousness established in you as being in relation to Him.
Ques. Is that the way we are brought into the kingdom of God?
{294}
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. We stand in relation to Christ as the Sun of Righteousness, and as God's righteousness in Him.
Ques. How do we stand in relation to Him as the righteous One?
F.E.R. He is the Head, and you recognise Him as such, in the same way as the earth is to the sun, or the moon to the earth. My conduct in the world is not governed by man, but by Christ; He is my Head, He is the Head of every man. "Righteous, even as he is righteous". I stand in a righteous relation to Him, and then I practice righteousness.
Nothing is actually established in man -- everything is established in the Son of man, the Son of Abraham, the Son of David. It is all in the Son; all is pointing onto Christ coming in as the Sun of Righteousness. Everything for us depends on the consciousness of standing in relation to the Head. No one practises righteousness except as he is standing in that relation.
Ques. Everything else is lawlessness, is it not?
F.E.R. Yes. The practical result is that instead of being here for man's will, we are here for the will of God. It was Christ who brought the will of God into the world, and we are here to be in the good of it.
Rem. That aspect of righteousness is very important. Not only has He paid the righteous debt, but He "loved righteousness, and hated iniquity". That the Lord paid the righteous debt is a detail, although of immense importance in itself.
F.E.R. Exactly. Men are under certain liabilities, and Christ takes up the liabilities in order that we may stand in relation to Him. "The righteous Lord loveth righteousness", and He had it in Christ.
Rem. The "detail" revealed love.
F.E.R. All God's righteousness had its spring in love. In the law God enjoined, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart". Love is the fulfilling of the law.
Rem. Love is the spring of all practical righteousness.
{295}
F.E.R. Exactly; the root of divine righteousness is love. It is unrighteous not to love.
Ques. Are we reckoned righteous in view of God's world, and not in view of this?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
Ques. For a man to practise righteousness, he must be righteous.
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. How?
F.E.R. By being brought into relation with the righteous One.
Ques. By faith?
F.E.R. By the Spirit. You cannot speak of a man standing in relation to Christ unless he has the Spirit.
Ques. Do faith and the Spirit go on concurrently all along?
F.E.R. Yes. The Spirit comes in order that the flesh may go. The flesh came to an end before God, that He might give the Spirit. The Spirit comes so that circumcision may be effectual.
The grace of God will not be content until He has brought you to eternal life; the Son of God will not be content until He has brought eternal life into this world.
Ques. Is that pictured in @Psalm 133?
F.E.R. Yes. The Sun of Righteousness will arise with healing in His wings. Men are poisoned and destroyed by the poisonous literature of the world, and many other things, while the Sun of Righteousness brings in the light of God. The minds of the saints are poisoned, to a great extent, by reading. They read the abominable literature of the present day -- Carlyle and Ruskin, for instance. All that is poisonous and deadening. The light of great luminaries in this world is more deadly than even the lower kinds of trash, for these we naturally avoid.
Rem. We want power and reality to set us free from any desire for them.
F.E.R. Not after the traditions of men, the rudiments of the world, but "after Christ". "In him dwelleth
{296}
all the fulness of the Godhead bodily".
Ques. Would you say a word as to present salvation?
F.E.R. It is man's emancipation from all that is in this world -- from the system of things where the god of this world can act. It is deliverance out of that system altogether.
Ques. Why is Abraham's first step of faith to leave his kindred and his father's house?
F.E.R. A man has to forsake all, to break with everything, for the sake of God.
Ques. Would you say a word as to circumcision as the seal of righteousness?
F.E.R. A man has got the power to set aside all that is of the flesh.
Ques. Through the Spirit?
F.E.R. Yes. "They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh". To us now, the Spirit is the seal of righteousness; the Spirit is the power that practically sets aside the flesh. You could not have circumcision without the Spirit, that is the seal of righteousness.
Rem. Then what you press is that a condition is wrought prior to practical righteousness flowing out?
F.E.R. Yes. I do not mind how you express it, but the point in my mind is that a man stands in relation to the Sun of Righteousness before there can be anything for God.
Ques. Then both righteousness and salvation are enjoyed?
F.E.R. Yes. Grace puts you there, and the Spirit establishes you there. *Life* is shown in carrying out the righteous requirement of the law -- "the Spirit is *life* because of righteousness".
Rem. You cannot have salvation really without the Holy Spirit.
F.E.R. A man is justified in regard to God. You do not get justification in its full extent until you come to life. I admit a believer is justified, but it is justification of life. You do not get salvation apart from the Holy
{297}
Spirit.
Ques. "Thou shalt call his name Jesus" -- what does that mean?
F.E.R. He will save from the consequences of their sins.
Ques. What are they?
F.E.R. What men come under in government -- the judgment of God. It refers to the position in which, Israel is and will be.
Justification is not simply that a criminal is pardoned, but a man is cleared from all the system in which he had been under reproach -- from all that with which he had been connected. He is in Christ -- justification is in *Him*. I am cleared from all that which is obnoxious to God. I am in another world; I had reproach in connection with this world, but *now* I am in Christ.
Ques. Is the thought of justification of life brought out in its fulness in @1 John 4?
F.E.R. Quite so -- "Because as he is, so are we".
{298}
THE SCOPE OF 1 CORINTHIANS
F.E.R. There is perfect correspondence between Christ above and the Spirit here. Christ is the truth, and the Spirit is the truth, and, generally speaking, the work of the apostle Paul was to unfold the consequences of the Spirit here in perfect answer to Christ above. It helps us to understand the writings of Paul when we see the line he follows in his epistles. He is always on the line of what was of the Spirit, unfolding all the consequences of having the Spirit here in perfect correspondence with Christ.
There are three great points in Corinthians. It is not like Romans, where the chief thought is righteousness, and bringing us to righteousness; but here it is more privilege. There are three points brought out -- the temple, the body and victory over death. "Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory".
Ques. Will you say what John's line is in contrast to Paul?
F.E.R. I think John is confirmatory of Paul. It has been said, 'Paul carries us to heaven, and in John it is the other way, he brings heaven to earth'.
Ques. Why is it the temple, and not the house?
F.E.R. Christ is the temple of God properly -- the Lord spoke of Himself as such. Here it is, "*Ye* are the temple of God" -- "*Ye* are the body of Christ" -- the two things go together, the church occupies the place of Christ here.
Ques. Do we get the house or the temple here?
F.E.R. The temple is the house -- there is not much difference between them. The idea of the temple is, the oracles of God are there; the house sets forth the place where everything is ordered by God. The saints of God are the house of God, and come under the influence of divine teaching. The temple is more where the oracles of
{299}
God are. The oracles of God were there in Christ. The Lord says, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.... he spake of the temple of his body". The house of God is akin to 'household'. My household comes under my care, my discipline, my attention. The oracles of God are in the 'temple', because the Spirit of God is there -- "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?" The Spirit was there, hence whatever light there was from God was there in the temple.
Ques. Is that part of the christian calling?
F.E.R. It is an immense privilege connected with the presence of the Spirit; Paul follows the line of the Spirit. The Spirit came to dwell -- Christ prepared the temple, and the Spirit came to dwell in it. There was what we might call a revolution -- instead of being only amongst the Jews, the temple was among the gentiles; but the whole thing depended upon the presence of the Spirit to bring out perfect correspondence to what is true in Christ.
Ques. Why does the apostle bring in privilege to correct the bad state of the Corinthians?
F.E.R. To pull them up.
Ques. He does so in Galatians also.
F.E.R. Very much. His writing did not make them this -- they were so already; but all depended on the presence of the Spirit. It was proper christian privilege -- "the temple of God", "the body of Christ". "Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory". These were true of any assembly in any place. The enjoyment of these things was their privilege.
Ques. Then would you press privilege on saints who are in danger of lapsing?
F.E.R. I think so. They were faulty in that way. There are two important obligations -- holiness and unity. The temple of God involves both.
Rem. Pointing out their faults was a very important correction.
{300}
Rem. It was by showing *good*.
F.E.R. Quite so. If a doctor sets to diagnose the case of a sick man, he has a *sound* man in his mind at the time. He must have this, or he could scarcely tell what is *not* sound.
Rem. The best way to mend an old coat is to give a man a new one.
Ques. In what way is the Spirit the truth?
F.E.R. The Spirit is in perfect correspondence with Christ above. Christ is the truth, the expression of it, it is set forth in Christ, and the Spirit perfectly corresponds with Christ.
Rem. Then Christ is still the truth, in glory, and the Spirit is the truth here.
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. Christ is in heaven, and He is the temple. We see life and incorruptibility brought to light, we see everything in Christ, while the answer to it down here is the work of the Spirit. In this epistle you see what is consequent on the *presence* of the Spirit apart from the *work* of the Spirit, in a kind of way.
Ques. What does he mean by saying, "Hitherto ye were not able to bear it"?
F.E.R. They had given so much licence to the flesh that they had dropped down to the level of the people around them. They were not able to bear what was spiritual.
Ques. The temple, the body, and victory over death -- are they in the line of what is spiritual?
F.E.R. They are spiritual -- but the great thing is to keep to first principles. If you give up first principles, you give up christianity. But christianity is *Christ*, you must remember, and not a system. Christianity is Christ, but you could not say that Christ is christianity.
Ques. What do you mean by that?
F.E.R. Well, what is christianity but Christ? It is a reproduction of Christ on the earth by the Spirit; anything short of that is not christianity.
Rem. The Spirit is the truth, and He reproduces
{301}
Christ in the saints.
F.E.R. Exactly. In 2 Corinthians the apostle goes further, but in 1 Corinthians he has to keep to first principles, that they may understand the temple of God, and the body of Christ. They hardly understood the presence of the Spirit -- much less what is dependent on having the Spirit.
Ques. Do you mean by correspondence to Christ here that God has secured on earth what is adequate to the setting forth of Christ -- that in the temple, the body, and victory over death, God has secured what shews His triumph over all that man does in thwarting Him?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. The answer to what God has wrought for Himself is made effectual by the Spirit.
Ques. Does responsibility come in in connection with it?
F.E.R. Yes, you recognise the obligation of holiness, as well as of unity. You recognise *privilege*, and then you come under obligations -- they flow from privilege.
Ques. Will you say a word as to 'victory over death'?
F.E.R. It anticipates what will be brought to pass in the millennium -- "Death is swallowed up in victory". Death has lost its power over us. "Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ".
Rem. Meanwhile we get the good of it.
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
Ques. Why does the apostle not touch resurrection till the end of the epistle?
F.E.R. You must first get hold of first principles. Victory is there for you, it is not that you have it; but "ye are the body of Christ" is positive in the way of privilege -- every christian is in it. God does not take 'victory' up on the ground of privilege -- He *gives* it.
Ques. Did you say that nothing which was brought about in Christ will pass away? Will you enumerate some of these things?
{302}
F.E.R. Well, you have got the temple, the anointed Man, victory over death -- everything; it is a great principle, it would be unthinkable for man or Satan to be able to dislodge anything that God has set up here. For example, the temple of Solomon was never set aside -- it was superseded, as we have it here, "Ye are the temple of God". It is the same general idea -- the idea of the *temple*, which is maintained. There is "the latter glory of the house" in Haggai.
Ques. Is the exhortation as to discipline based on the fact -- "Ye are the temple of God"?
F.E.R. Exactly. God dwells in you -- hence the obligations of holiness in God's temple.... It is the corporate thought, it must be so.
Ques. Does the teaching of the Supper come in with a view to unity?
F.E.R. Yes. The assembly consists of the temple of God, whether it comes together or not. It is the assembly that comes together. Chapter 11 presupposes unity, and so you get in chapter 10, "The bread which *we* break". There is the idea of unity, and it is developed in chapter 12. At the Supper, we put Him in His proper place, and He puts us in ours. We never get unity if we are not right in regard of Christ -- I mean practically.
Ques. Where does unity now find expression?
F.E.R. In those who apprehend the truth of it. The unity of the body is a fact -- "we have all been baptised into one body". You cannot do away with it, but I should not know where to find it. Things may be obscured, but they cannot be set aside. All is obscured now, and it is extremely difficult to point out *where* this great fact may be seen. The reality may be obscured, but it is there all the same.
There was a great deal obscured among the Corinthians, by their practice and so on. The very people to whom these things were written were mixed up with the heathen around them. The great difficulty nowadays is unreal profession.
{303}
Ques. How are divine realities now made good to us?
F.E.R. The moment you apprehend the truth, and come under the consciousness of it, you accept the obligations to holiness, and the word brings you apart from everything, and you "call on the Lord out of a pure heart".
Ques. Has christianity ever been really seen?
F.E.R. The assembly was declared to be the epistle of Christ known and read of all men. I think christianity was manifested in that way. They recognised the Spirit dwelling among them, and were under the obligations of holiness. Contrast that with the professing church now -- it is very difficult to purge out offenders from it. All sorts of things go on there. You do not hear of discipline unless there is a clergyman holding flagrant doctrine, or committing some publicly-known moral evil. Discipline becomes a necessity if you are to maintain holiness. If the presence of the Spirit is recognised discipline becomes a real necessity. We are to put away from ourselves the leaven.
Ques. Does "Take these things hence" correspond with that?
F.E.R. I think so. It is an awful thing to bring principles which are corrupt and defiling to bear on people. God would judge that man.
Rem. Corruption of that kind is really destructive of christianity -- such as maintaining that there is no need of the atonement.
Ques. Would you not say that unitarianism and the like are very corrupting?
F.E.R. Unitarianism is not really christian at all. A man who does not admit Jesus Christ come in flesh is not to be counted as a christian.
Ques. Do you see it in Thyatira?
F.E.R. She teaches and seduces; it is very corrupting. And then there is the gainsaying of Core, the corrupting of the priesthood.
Ques. Would you say a little about unity, and what
{304}
promotes it?
F.E.R. Well, you have to accept it as a necessary consequence of the presence of the Spirit. "By one Spirit are we all baptized into one body", i.e., the presence of the Spirit sets aside all that is after the flesh.
Ques. Is it in the same way you recognise holiness?
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. Does union precede unity?
F.E.R. No, I think unity depends upon the presence of the Spirit -- "By one Spirit", that is the point.
Ques. What is union connected with?
F.E.R. You are "married to another", you are united to the One who is raised from the dead. "He that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit". All that is more or less individual. Law is taken up as the first husband; now, "ye are married to another", to Christ. He becomes the Husband to you. Union is connected with the bride, but unity with the presence of the Spirit.
Rem. "Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit".
F.E.R. Exactly. The Spirit has come to establish unity, and our obligation is to keep it in the uniting bond of peace.
Ques. Why does it come in in connection with the house?
F.E.R. It is to be kept in the house -- "forbearing one another in love"; therefore it is a very important point as a practical witness that our own will is set aside.
You cannot have unity as long as man's will is not set aside. You want one will (and that is what we have in the Spirit) to rule all -- then you have unity. Unity could not be brought about any other way.
Rem. As brought into the sense of the love of God, you delight in His will.
F.E.R. I think so -- @Romans 12: 1, 2. If power comes in, it sets aside all our will, and then we are according to the will of God.
Ques. Is there any difference between the unity of
{305}
the body and the unity of the Spirit?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. The unity of the Spirit brings in obligation to maintain "the bond of peace", but "one body" is the statement of an existing fact which is not committed to our responsibility to keep.
You see another thing come to pass in the church -- instead of the Spirit ruling, you see men ruling. When the church was first set up, the *Spirit* ruled. There were defects and failures, but everything was ruled by the *Spirit*.
Ques. Does the end of @Acts 4 illustrate it -- "Of one heart and of one soul",?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
Ques. "With all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering" comes first. There must be that condition?
F.E.R. Yes, there must be. As long as the Spirit had His place in the church, unity was manifested, but when the Spirit was set aside, discord came in. The working of the flesh brings discord in. When you keep out all intrusion of the *flesh*, you get unity. All is regulated by the Spirit of God.
Ques. 'Endeavouring' shews that there is some difficulty?
F.E.R. Yes; they were to shew diligence. If you look under the surface, there are all sorts of feelings, jealousies, etc.
Ques. What is the remedy, for it is a widespread disease?
F.E.R. The only way is to get right with *Christ*. If people are not right with one another, they are not right with Christ. They may think they are, but they are not. The moment you find that sort of thing coming in, you will find you are not right with Christ. In Timothy we are told, "Take heed unto *thyself*".
Rem. @Philippians 2 might help.
F.E.R. Yes. They were to have the same mind. There were certain jars among them, and they were exhorted to have the same mind -- "of one accord, of
{306}
one mind". The saints were ministering to the apostle, they were shewing the fellowship of the Spirit, and the comfort of love, and so on, but there was discord, and Paul says, "Fulfil ye my joy". There *is* fellowship, now complete my joy by being of the same mind.
Ques. How does the washing of the feet come in here?
Rem. You must first be like Christ, be of no repute, be nothing yourself.
F.E.R. I do not like the expression "emptied himself" often used here. It may be correct, but I do not like it very much. It is 'made himself of no account'.
Rem. The only thing which will make that possible for us is for the heart to be right with Christ.
Rem. If saints are wrong with one another, it indicates wounded flesh.
F.E.R. Yes. You want to get grace from the Lord for it. It is a matter of vital moment, as meetings are often affected without the saints seeing the reason why.
Rem. The Supper brings love before us.
F.E.R. Yes; but many take the Supper sacramentally, and not in a moral way. The Lord made Himself of no reputation, no account.
Ques. Does not @Psalm 132 set forth the preparation for the assembly, the state suited for it?
Rem. Euodias and Syntyche were to be of the same mind in the Lord.
F.E.R. Quite so -- "in the *Lord*".
{307}
COMPARISON OF THE EPISTLES
@2 Corinthians 3: 1 - 6; @2 Corinthians 5: 14 - 21
F.E.R. The thought was to touch on five epistles -- Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Colossians and Ephesians, and to note the leading point of each.
I think there is an essential distinction between these epistles. In Romans and 1 and 2 Corinthians you are on moral ground, but when you come to Colossians and Ephesians, you are on the ground of purpose. The apprehension of this distinction helps us to understand them.
Ques. Wherein lies the importance of the distinction?
F.E.R. You are not prepared to come on to the ground of *purpose* until you know what is moral, until you are established in what is moral. That is fundamental.
Ques. Does what is moral include responsibility?
F.E.R. Well, it does. It is what is necessarily consequent on the revelation of God. In Romans you get a christian here in responsibility. God having come out involves man being here, not for his own will, but for the will of God. In 1 Corinthians you get another point, which is consequent on the presence of the Spirit, that is, privilege, which necessarily flows from it. Now in 2 Corinthians you get ministry leading up to the thought of a "man in Christ". In all three, it is *moral*, not exactly *purpose*.
Ques. What did you say the ministry is leading up to?
F.E.R. To a "man in Christ". At the close of 1 Corinthians you have the "last Adam" -- Man risen -- but at the close of the second epistle you get a "man in Christ". Leading up to this is the ministry of the new covenant, and the ministry of reconciliation. The
{308}
ground is moral, *it* is necessarily consequent upon the way God is pleased to reveal Himself.
Ques. Does not @Romans 8 touch purpose?
F.E.R. It does at the end -- "all things work together for good", etc. That is to bring in assurance of heart.
Ques. Does Corinthians bring in corporate responsibility?
F.E.R. It does; but the great thought is privilege -- "ye are the temple of God", and "the body of Christ". It is more the thought of privilege consequent on the presence of the Spirit.
Ques. Does the second epistle continue the thought of privilege?
F.E.R. No. The second epistle takes up the ministry leading up to "a man in Christ", to prepare you to enter on the ground of purpose.
Ques. Will you say a word as to the ministry of the new covenant?
F.E.R. It is the ministry of the gospel. It is ministered to saints, but it is really the gospel; then the ministry of reconciliation is all leading up to the truth of a "man in Christ" at the end. Reconciliation presents what man is for God.
Ques. Is the ministry of reconciliation beyond the gospel?
F.E.R. It all forms part of the gospel. The two things, new covenant and reconciliation, are distinct. It is not very difficult to apprehend the distinction, because what God is toward man, and what man is to God, are very distinct. You get both in Christ.
Ques. Do you get reconciliation in Romans?
F.E.R. Not developed. It is only just touched upon.
Ques. When you speak of ministry, do you mean what had already been ministered?
F.E.R. The apostle was giving the character of his ministry. "Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament" -- "hath given to us the ministry
{309}
of reconciliation". The ministry has all come out, but it has to be *maintained*. It was specially confided to the apostle, but provision has been made for the maintenance of the ministry.
Rem. Only a "man in Christ" could appreciate purpose.
F.E.R. Quite so. A "man in Christ" is an abstract idea, and when you can enter into the idea of a "man in Christ", you can enter upon the ground of purpose.
Ques. Do you refer to chapter 5 or 12 for a "man in Christ?"
F.E.R. Chapter 12. There the apostle speaks of a "man in Christ" in an abstract way, that he had known such.
Rem. I think it would be well to develop it a little, and to press the importance of having in the history of the soul what is moral, before entering upon purpose.
F.E.R. It leads up to and prepares one for entering into purpose.
Rem. Otherwise the tendency would be to build the house from the roof.
Ques. Is what is moral connected with the work of God in the soul?
F.E.R. Not exactly. I think it is a necessary consequence of the way God has been pleased to reveal Himself -- of light having come in from Him.
Rem. That is, you must have righteousness, holiness and so on.
F.E.R. Exactly. It is moral, not exactly purpose.
Ques. How do you distinguish between that and responsibility?
F.E.R. If I understand where I am, it involves responsibility as long as I am down here. It is perfectly possible for me to be here for God's will, or, to a certain extent, for my own will. But I am responsible to be here for *God's* will. As long as God is absent, the element of responsibility must come in. We are to be here for *God's* will.
{310}
Rem. You mean what is presented in @Romans 12: 2.
F.E.R. Yes. Romans speaks of the ruin of man -- man's moral state.
Ques. As having already utterly failed in responsibility?
F.E.R. Yes. It opens in that way.
Ques. "The kingdom of God is righteousness", etc., that is moral?
F.E.R. Yes; but if you enter into the kingdom of God, you are to be here for the will of God.
Rem. There is a tendency to pass by many things, and to try to enter into purpose, before the soul is established.
F.E.R. People may try to do so, but it is wrong.
Ques. What would be the result of an unestablished soul taking up purpose?
F.E.R. I should think that, some way or another, he would be likely to come to grief.
Ques. What is the effect of ministry?
F.E.R. It leads up to the apprehension of a "man in Christ". It is the way God takes to lead souls into the apprehension of that. In Romans, a christian is said to be in Christ, but being "in Christ" and "a man in Christ" is not the same thought. Every christian is in Christ -- "There is ... no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus", but the other is different. Every christian is "in Christ" and therefore he has *responsibility* as a man on earth. He is in Christ, but in *responsibility*; but when you apprehend a "man in Christ" you are *outside* responsibility. A "man in Christ" goes into the third heaven, and hears unspeakable words, which it is not possible for man to utter. He does not glory of himself. If you apprehend a "man in Christ", apart from self, he must be also apart from responsibility in the wilderness path here.
Ques. Is that what is meant by, "whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God"?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. The ministry of the new
{311}
covenant, which is the first step towards the understanding of a "man in Christ", is really to make us acquainted with what God has taught. If a man has got thus far, he is prepared to recognise that he is for God. First, God is for us, then we are for God.
Rem. So the ministry of the new covenant is preparatory to that of reconciliation.
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. The ministry of the new covenant is what people really want.
Ques. Do we have purpose presented in Galatians when they were in a legal state?
F.E.R. The apostle presents the thoughts of God to them to measure their defection.
Ques. Where is it presented in Galatians?
F.E.R. It says, "ye are all God's sons". It is in that way.
Ques. Is it not helpful to see that ministry opens up that which already exists, and is already declared?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. Ministry is not a proclamation. The gospel is a proclamation undoubtedly, but ministry is not. Ministry is to bring home to souls what lies behind the proclamation. You get the two things in Christ -- God perfectly declared, and man perfectly for God. Reconciliation was there because Christ was there. Men were viewed as being on a different footing because Christ was there. Ministry has to be maintained. The apostle gives us the character of the ministry. Gifts are given to the church "till we all come in the unity of the faith", etc. The Spirit of God maintains ministry.
Ques. Where would you turn to in Acts for the proclamation?
F.E.R. "Be it known unto you ... that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: and by him all that believe are justified from all things". The proclamation is in the name of Jesus Christ.
Ques. Is there no proclamation now?
F.E.R. There would be if you went among the heathen, but I think in christendom it is much more the
{312}
ministry of the gospel.
Ques. If a man were speaking to a company of unconverted people, would it not be the proclamation of the gospel?
F.E.R. Well, but, in one sense, they are professedly christians. That is the difficulty in a country like England.
Ques. But supposing they were perfectly ignorant?
F.E.R. Still, they will be judged on that ground.
Ques. Then the idea of the proclamation is carrying the gospel to those who have never known it?
F.E.R. I think so. In a place like England, you have to urge that they are responsible in regard to where they are. They have gone forth to meet the Bridegroom (using the figure of the ten virgins) and you have to take them upon that ground.
I see one thing very evident at the present time -- there is distinct *hostility* to christianity, even in those who do not go to church or chapel, not merely indifference, but distinct hostility. Still you have to go on preaching the word, and doing the work of an evangelist, even more urgently, for you cannot close your eyes to the condition of affairs. There is general apostasy coming.
Ques. Will not every man be judged according to his place?
F.E.R. Yes. God will judge perfectly rightly. The severest judgment of God will come on christendom. You need only read 2 Thessalonians to see that.
Rem. Then now you have to call people's attention to the proclamation that has been made.
F.E.R. Yes, and to explain it. The ministry of the new covenant is virtually the ministry of the gospel. I think when you go beyond the proclamation of the facts of the gospel, you go on to ministry. I think it much more ministry than proclamation now.
Rem. Paul says, "believed on in the world". It was already an accepted thing in his day.
{313}
Rem. J.N.D. used to say it was not merely the facts, but the *bearing* of the facts.
Rem. Also that you could not be too simple in preaching the facts.
F.E.R. Well, the great fact is *Christ* ... Christ is the Head of every man, and all consequences flow from that. God has set Christ as the Head of every man, and man is responsible to come to Christ and get living water.
Ques. What is involved in Christ being the Head of every man?
F.E.R. Every man is subjected to Christ, and man is responsible to bow to Christ, and if he does, he receives forgiveness of sins, and gets living water.
Ques. What is the difference between headship and lordship?
F.E.R. Headship gives pre-eminence -- for example, Adam was head, but he was not lord. I should present Christ as Head, as the last Adam, and as the giver of living water.
Rem. One would be grace, and the other responsibility.
F.E.R. Exactly. Christ did not take up His place as Head, and as last Adam, until resurrection. That is the ground on which He takes up His place as Head of every man, as having borne death, under which every man was.
Ques. Is the idea of headship that God has a Man through whom He can approach man in grace?
F.E.R. That is the point. The effect is that every man is tested by the voice of God through Christ, and those who answer to the test get living water. Others prove themselves lawless, and come under judgment.
Ques. As to administration, is that headship or lordship?
F.E.R. Lordship. It is really the authority and power of God as against all evil. Blessing comes in through the Head. In @Revelation 22 you get, "I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star",
{314}
and then it speaks of living water, "whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely".
Every servant acts under the Lord, you get direction from the Lord. The idea is found in the end of Mark -- "The Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following". If you preach Christ, you preach the Head. Jesus is the Christ, and the anointed Man is the Head of every man.
You have the thought brought out in another form in the end of @Romans 5, "by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life". That is, there is the righteous One, and it is through Him towards all to justification of life.
Rem. There is nothing more wonderful than for the Son of God to have taken a place *in reference to man*. He became man in order to do this, and so to give living water.
F.E.R. He is the one Man in whom God addresses Himself to all men. Christ is the Head of every man because He has borne man's liabilities, and He will impart living water to all who believe. Men come under judgment as being lawless.
Ques. Shall we get on to reconciliation a little?
F.E.R. In the new covenant you get the declaration of God's mind. The new covenant is virtually the gospel -- the declaration of God's mind towards man, i.e., righteousness and the Spirit. Man's immediate liabilities were death and the curse. Christ took the curse and died for all. 'Liabilities' represent that under which man is at the present time. "It is appointed unto men once to die", and "if one died for all, then were all dead". The liability of Israel was a broken law, and the curse, and Christ bore the curse. 'Liability' is that under which man is *now*. Christ comes in as the Head of every man because He has borne the liabilities of every man, and He imparts living water.
{315}
Rem. That is only available for the one who believes.
F.E.R. He gives living water to all who believe. The one who believes in Christ, and bows to the Head, gets living water.
Ques. Do you mean the Holy Spirit by "living water"?
F.E.R. The Spirit of Christ. Christ is the last Adam to man, every man is tested by Christ. If there were the assertion of the *lordship* of Christ, there would be the "day of the Lord" *now*. It is by the mercy of God that lordship is not asserted now. *We* claim Him as Lord because we want salvation. "The name of the Lord is a strong tower". ... If a man is to be delivered from the bondage of evil, he needs salvation to come in. As to the gift of living water, Christ gives life -- "the Spirit is life". "The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life". That is what the last Adam does, He is the quickening, the life-giving, Spirit.
Ques. How far does 'Mediator' go? Would it take in Christ as Head and Lord?
F.E.R. I think as Head. It is the Man, the One in whom God puts Himself in communication with men. "One mediator ... the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all", making known God's mind towards man -- "Repentance and forgiveness of sins". If you go behind that, it is *love*, the disposition of God towards men, made known through the death of Christ. If God is completely for man, as a necessary consequence man must be completely for God, That is reconciliation.
Man is for God in Christ. "If any one be in Christ, there is a new creation". Reconciliation is in Christ -- all is to be for God. It leads on to the thought of "a man in Christ".
{316}
COMPARISON OF THE EPISTLES -- (CONTINUED)
@Colossians 2: 1 - 23
F.E.R. In this epistle we enter on ground different from that which we have been considering. One thing that comes out prominently is the work of God in connection with the accomplishment of His purpose, and this is carried on in Ephesians. It has often been noticed that what you get here corresponds with the other side of Jordan -- the promised land. You enter on the ground of purpose. In that connection you get the "body" -- not simply the new covenant or reconciliation.
Ques. Are the ministries of the new covenant and of reconciliation both supposed in this epistle?
F.E.R. I think so; both are referred to in the beginning. The point is this, that in chapter 2 you are brought into association with Christ and that by the work of God; but association with Christ must be the other side of Jordan -- that is quite evident.... In Colossians it is not simply the moral idea of Christ as Head of every man, but as Head of all principality and power. That is the way He is brought in, and then, being Head of all principality and power, He is Head to the body.
Ques. Is there any difference between counsel and purpose?
F.E.R. Not that I know of. Counsel and purpose, I suspect, are pretty much one in meaning.
Ques. Did you say that before you can apprehend Colossians and Ephesians, you must apprehend what "a man in Christ" is?
F.E.R. I think so -- for this reason, you cannot take the responsible man the other side of Jordan. "A man in Christ" belongs to the other side of Jordan, and is in association with Christ.
Ques. In how many spheres do we see Christ as Head?
{317}
F.E.R. In two, as far as I understand it. He is the Head of every man, and He is Head of all principality and power, and it is as being the latter that He is Head to the church. Scripture connects them in that way. "Head of all principality and power" is the fulfilment of @Psalm 8, but the church does not exactly come in there. Here the church is His body.
Ques. What does 'Head' convey to you?
F.E.R. Pre-eminence.
Ques. Not direction too?
F.E.R. Yes, but chiefly pre-eminence. All takes its character from the Head -- as the woman takes character from the man.
Ques. Is there any difference between "head *of* the body", and 'head *to* the body'?
F.E.R. I do not know at all. I had not thought of it.
Ques. In what sense is the head of Christ *God*?
F.E.R. That is Corinthians. The Son of God is become Man, and as having taken that place, God is "the head of Christ".
Rem. It is the position He has taken in grace.
F.E.R. Quite so. The husband is head of the wife. In the House of Commons, the Speaker is head of the House, and gives character to the House. He is not *lord* to the House -- the sovereign would be that.
Ques. Is it the work of God that makes you capable of entering into His purpose?
F.E.R. In order to enter into His purpose you must have a certain preparation. All the work of God consists in the accomplishment of His purpose. The work of God in regard to Christ, in raising Him from the dead, was the *beginning*, and it is continued in us to bring us into association with Christ risen. That is where the truth of the body comes in.
Ques. Is baptism brought in to shew us the end of the responsible man?
F.E.R. I think it is, "buried with him in baptism". You have to come back to baptism -- the burial of the
{318}
flesh. The point is, you are risen with Him, and have come into the reality of baptism.
Ques. It is not individual in Colossians, is it?
F.E.R. It is to bring us into what is collective or corporate.
Ques. Is "a man in Christ" individual?
F.E.R. That is individual. In Colossians it is "Christ in you" -- not simply in one person. You cannot limit it to individuals -- it brings in the corporate thought.
Ques. Is "Christ in you" by the work of God in the souls of the christian company?
F.E.R. I think so. It is the pledge of glory -- Christ being in us.
Ques. And "the hope which is laid up for you in heaven" -- what is that?
F.E.R. I do not know whether it refers to the inheritance or not.
Rem. I take it that it stands in contrast with what the Jews had on earth. The gentiles had no inheritance on the earth. What they had was laid up for them in heaven.
Ques. What is the difference between 'raised' and 'quickened' with Christ?
F.E.R. It is important to understand the force of Christ risen. Resurrection is not a mere fact, it is a *divine beginning*. It is the witness which God has given to the whole world, but it is also the beginning of God's purpose.... Christ is the beginning, the First-born from the dead, the starting-point of God's purpose. Everything comes to a close in death down here, and the starting-point of God's purpose is the *resurrection* of *Christ*.
Rem. So what is actually true of Him becomes spiritually true of you.
F.E.R. Exactly.... It is as Head of all principality and power that He is Head of the church.
Rem. You get it in figure in Adam.
{319}
F.E.R. Yes. God set him over all the works of His hands, and then made him head to the woman. The practical point of that is that the church comes into the inheritance because He is the Head. It is the accomplishment of @Psalm 8 with the additional thought that He is Head of the church, to bring the body into the inheritance. The body and the Head involve the truth of the *bride*, and the great point in connection with the bride is that she shares the inheritance of the Bridegroom. The bride is left here as "espoused ... as a chaste virgin to Christ", to have no interests of her own, but to be identified with Christ's interests, and then she shares the inheritance. This inheritance is brought out in @Ephesians 1 -- "In whom also we have obtained an inheritance".
Ques. What do you understand by "principality and power"?
F.E.R. Everything is put under Christ. I do not suppose principalities and powers will be entirely abolished, but all come under Christ in the millennium. God will allow the kingdoms of this world to abide, but all are to be subject to Christ. 'Kings shall fall down before him'. Christ comes, and everything is put under Him, and takes its character from Him. There will be thrones and dominions, but all will be subject to Him.
Ques. Do you exclude the idea of deriving from the Head, in speaking of Christ as Head of the assembly?
F.E.R. No. The assembly derives from Christ, as the wife gets her character from the husband.
Ques. What is "not holding the Head"?
F.E.R. Not deriving from Christ.
Ques. What is the leading difference between Colossians and Ephesians?
F.E.R. You get the body in Colossians, but in Ephesians the great thought is the glory of God in the church. In Colossians it is association with Christ -- a worshipping company in association with the Head, while Ephesians rises to the glory of God in the church
{320}
throughout all ages. Colossians is on the line of *going in*, while Ephesians is on the line of *coming out*. The former gives us the ground of divine purpose, and there is the apprehension of Christ as the beginning, the First-born from among the dead, and by the work of God we are brought into association with Him. The Spirit of God hides Himself, as it were, behind His work. It is of importance to distinguish between epistles on *moral* ground and those of divine *purpose*. In the latter you get the *work* of God -- while there is not much of this in epistles such as Romans and Corinthians. In Colossians, the work of God gives effect to His purpose.
Rem. There is strong similarity between Colossians and Ephesians.
F.E.R. Because they are on the ground of divine purpose. You must go in before you can come out -- i.e., you must have the body going in to appreciate what is inside before you can have the vessel of God coming out "having the glory of God".
Ques. Is the thought of crossing Jordan in Ephesians?
F.E.R. No, because Ephesians is limited almost exclusively to the work of God. The saints are looked at as being *in*, so that eventually they may come out.
Ques. What is meant by 'going in'?
F.E.R. To accept a place with God, according to what God has given you. A man cannot go in to God unless he is called. Even Christ was *called* to be High Priest. Man cannot go in to God except as God chooses.
Rem. That calling reaches every christian, or is supposed to.
F.E.R. Yes, and the pleasure of God is to work it in you.
Ques. What is the importance of saying, "That Christ may dwell in your hearts *by faith*"? @Ephesians 3: 17.
F.E.R. Because it is the greatest thing come to pass *down here*. It indicates to me that I have to surrender every interest attached to man here, so that I may have
{321}
all the range of interests attached to Christ. Faith is the apprehension of the mind of God. You are "risen with him through the faith of the operation of God". Putting off the old and putting on the new is a question of spiritual power.
Ques. What does that involve?
F.E.R. That in practice and ways you glorify God.
Ques. How do we reach it?
F.E.R. You are risen with Christ. It is there for everyone. It is God's mind, and therefore, as far as I apprehend it, it is all ready for anyone if they are ready to take it up. It was just as much God's purpose to bring Israel through Jordan as through the Red Sea.
It is God's pleasure that you should have Christ dwelling in your heart by faith. Then you come out after the character of God, because you have gone in.
Ques. Is every one that is risen with Christ quickened?
F.E.R. Yes, you must be capable by the work of God. No one can take up that kind of position except as they are capable. When the Lord comes, we shall be quickened then, we shall be capable then, but we are capable even now by spiritual affection, so that there is such a thing as association with Christ in spiritual affection at the present time.
Rem. It is the true status of the assembly.
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. It comes out in @John 20. "Go to my brethren", etc.
Ques. Is the purpose of God true of every believer?
F.E.R. It is all *for* them; it is His pleasure, but they will not enter into it except in view of His work *in* them. But the point is that we hinder it. It is like hustling along an unwilling man; he catches at this and that to hinder his being carried along. So we catch at things around us and hinder our progress and prevent the Spirit of God getting us along.
Ques. What did you mean by 'capable' just now?
F.E.R. Well, you are capable as a father, capable as
{322}
a husband, or in any other relationship. You have affection suitable to your relationships. Spiritual affections are the result of God's work in you, the evidence of the quickening power of God. You cannot understand association with Christ unless there are affections akin to Christ. We ought to have intelligence, too, because we are risen with Him by faith. I think a person with affection is an intelligent person; the real way to intelligence is through affection.
Rem. You are conducted to Isaac.
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. Could there be the apprehension of the presence of Christ in the midst of His people apart from association with Him?
F.E.R. There may be the faith of His presence, but not very much of the consciousness of it. This is through affection. People may come together in the *faith* of His presence, but the consciousness of it is another thing.
Rem. That is where 'capability' comes in.
F.E.R. Yes. The great difficulty is that people are so unwilling to be carried on. God is willing to carry you on.
Rem. "Wilt thou go with this man?"
F.E.R. Yes, that is the thing.
Ques. Are there differences in the apprehension of Christ in the midst?
F.E.R. There is very little idea of Christ in the midst of the assembly.
Ques. Would it not be necessary to be in the apprehension of being risen with Christ in order to apprehend His presence?
F.E.R. You cannot bring Christ *this* side. If you are to enter at all into the thought of the assembly, you must know Christ as on the other side of death -- you must go to Him.
Ques. Is not that the thought of @John 20, where He says, as it were, 'I cannot come with you, you must come to me'?
{323}
F.E.R. Exactly. He does not meet us *here*, He comes to us on *God's* platform, and that is why you get the thought of being "risen with him" in this chapter. He may come to a person sympathetically, when under pressure, but "I will come to you" (@John 14) I connect with the assembly. I can understand that where it says "I will come in unto him and sup with him, and he with me", the Lord comes to me *sympathetically*, but in His coming to the company, it is to sing praise there. You find the church in John as to its *character*. Many miss the moral idea because they are looking for the *term*, and do not find it.
Ques. Which is greater, Colossians or Ephesians, going in or coming out?
F.E.R. Well, I think the glory of God set forth in the church. It is wonderful to come out to set forth His glory.
Rem. We cannot be coming out without first going in.
F.E.R. No. It is all according to His glory, or you could not have the glory of God. All is the work of God -- the flesh is excluded. You come out in the new man, and your walk is consistent with that. The new man is what is "after God is created in righteousness and true holiness". If I have been *in* to God as a worshipper, I do not want to falsify the character of God -- I want to come *out* in the character of God.
Ques. Do you get the coming out in @Ephesians 5 -- "Be ye therefore imitators of God"?
F.E.R. Yes -- that is coming out.
Rem. If that were so, then a man in business would make the assembly his chief interest. The interests of Christ in the church would be above those of his family or business. Young christians can make the assembly their first interest. It is an immense thought for us that, even if we are only a few and in weakness, we can gather together, and can make the assembly our chief interest.
Rem. *Business* seems to be slavery.
{324}
F.E.R. You have to take up things for an honest living, but the thing is you are not to be wholly taken up with them. People so often go beyond -- they are not content with food and raiment, and so they entangle themselves in bonds from which it is very difficult to get free.
Rem. It is a great relief to be able to turn away, after your business is over, to what you love -- to Christ and the assembly. It is a great thing to stick to the meetings of the assembly, and so keep in touch with the things of Christ. It is the greatest refreshment.
F.E.R. The assembly is where we ought to find *rest*. There is no *business* coming in there -- it is the *true rest* in association with Christ.
{325}
THE TWO PRAYERS
@Ephesians 1: 15 - 23; @Ephesians 3: 14 - 21
F.E.R. In Colossians we have the thought of the body, and association with Christ, while Ephesians carries us a point further, and we get union, and the witness. Ephesians is a climax, in a way.
Ques. Is *life* a prominent question in Colossians?
F.E.R. Yes, I think it is. The great point is that you are in the life of the Head, and that brings in the thought of the assembly. Christ is the Head of every man, but you could not speak of every man being in Christ. The 'body' is in Christ, and the 'body' is in the life of the Head.
Rem. "Ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power".
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. What is the difference between association and union?
F.E.R. To illustrate it -- @John 20 is association, but I do not think it is union.
Ques. Where do you get union?
F.E.R. In @Ephesians 2. There must be *two* to get union, while, in association, it is all *one*, in the life of Christ.
Ques. Is association higher than union?
F.E.R. It is a greater thing in one sense.
Rem. Because we are the "many brethren" of whom He is the First-born.
F.E.R. Yes, that is a greater thing than to be united to Him.
Ques. Which do you think is entered into first?
F.E.R. I am inclined to think that we enter into association first -- it is our calling. God brings about union in order that the church may be a witness. You get association by the work of God. It involves sonship --
{326}
sonship is the key to it.
Ques. How do we get union?
F.E.R. By the power of God. There is what God has wrought in Christ, and then what He has wrought in us -- "hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus".
Rem. We are brought into union with the anointed Man.
F.E.R. Yes, by the *work* of the Spirit, not simply by the indwelling of the Spirit. If you come into association with Christ, you must be capable, and you are only capable by the work of God. You get the indwelling of the Spirit in Romans, but in Colossians and Ephesians you get the work of the Spirit, the work of God. "You hath he quickened".
Ques. Is it individual?
F.E.R. It is effected in individuals, but the point is *Jew and gentile together* -- "made us sit together". The result is not individual, the result is *Jew and gentile together*.
Ques. When you say there must be two for union, you mean Christ and the church?
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. Have we not two in Colossians?
F.E.R. You have two in Colossians, but it is not quite the same as in Ephesians. "Quickened us together with Christ" is individual, then you get the corporate, "raised us up together", Jew and gentile together. "Quickened us together" must be individual, the work of God must have regard to us individually. You have to come to what is for *God*. The church has to be the vessel of glory -- God's witness -- we lose sight of ourselves in a way. The bride is the Lamb's wife, in whom you get witness for God. She has the glory of God in the presence of the universe.
Rem. The great point in Ephesians is 'risen'. The witness has come out now, and the meaning of chapter 3 is that the state is formed in the saints, in order that they
{327}
may be the witness. "Unto him be glory in the church".
F.E.R. Yes; the church, the bride, is the witness, all the work of God is to that end. The witness is filled unto all the fulness of God. God is really set forth in the assembly. That I understand to be the point of the prayer in chapter 3, "that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith".
The church is to be adequate for the witness of the glory of God here.
Rem. And if we enter into it, we have reached the point of God's rest.
F.E.R. Exactly.
Rem. I was referring to sitting down in the heavenlies, we have really reached the place of God's rest in Christ, and then we begin to answer to Him.
Ques. What is the point of the first prayer?
F.E.R. To know the hope of His calling, the glory of the inheritance, and the power of God which puts us into it.
Rem. All is realised by the work of God.
F.E.R. Yes. There is a distinction between the work of the Spirit and the indwelling of the Spirit. Everything is in the Spirit, but a man may have everything in the Spirit, and yet have very little *wrought in him*.
Ques. How is the testimony of the church borne now?
F.E.R. The testimony of the church is greatly obscured. The church is not answering to God at all, hence *Christ* is said to be "the faithful and true witness".
Ques. How does witness depend on union?
F.E.R. Because the church is united to Christ, and she is sharing the glory of Christ and His inheritance. She is the great witness of God's triumph. Take @Psalm 67 as an illustration -- "God be merciful unto us, and bless us ... that thy way may be known upon earth", etc. Israel will become God's witness on earth. The church shares the glory, and the church is the great witness of the triumph of grace. The kings of the earth shall bring their glory and honour into it. We ought to
{328}
anticipate the millennium.
Rem. "Unto him be glory *in the church* by Christ Jesus throughout all ages".
Ques. What is the hope of His calling?
F.E.R. I suppose it is heaven. "Blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places". Hence heaven constitutes the hope referred to.
Ques. Are "heavenly places" typified by the land of promise?
F.E.R. No. What I understand by the land of promise is the ground of purpose -- that which was in God's heart to lead the people into, in total contrast to all that with which they had been acquainted in Egypt. It is expressed in the words of Moses and the children of Israel as they stood on the wilderness side of the Red Sea -- "Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O Lord, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established".
Ques. How is it there is conflict in the heavenly places?
F.E.R. Because the power of evil is there -- the seat of the power of evil working on earth is in heavenly places. The power of evil rules on earth outside man, for the seat of it is in heavenly places.
Ques. Does not the church set forth what Christ was?
F.E.R. There is that set forth in the church which was not set forth in Christ -- the complete triumph of *grace*. That could not be set forth in Him, grace had no personal application to Christ.
Ques. What did you mean by 'capability'?
F.E.R. How can you enter the heavenly places without capability -- i.e., unless you are suitable?
Ques. Is it not by the presence of the Spirit?
F.E.R. It is the *work* of the Spirit. Paul did not know whether he was in the body or out of the body when he was caught up into the third heaven. You are not capable except by what is brought about by Christ.
{329}
He is the "quickening Spirit", and He will bring about capability in the way of spiritual affection, affection which is wrought in you by the Spirit. It is the *work* of the Spirit which brings in capability. "We love him, because he first loved us". The Spirit works so as to make us conscious of the love of God. We get capability in the way of spiritual affection.
Ques. Does it not say in @1 John 4 "he hath given us of his Spirit"?
F.E.R. That is more what is *characteristic*, and not *capability*. You get the idea of spiritual affection in the thought of Christ dwelling in the heart. "Ye, being rooted and grounded in love", "strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man", is that there may be capability. The "inner man" is the result of the Spirit's work -- the work of God -- and you need to be "strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man" in order "that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith", etc. In Ephesians the great thought is the presentation of God -- the vessel in which God is presented. The church will be the witness in the presence of the universe of the exceeding riches of His grace.
Ques. Was the prodigal 'capable' when he had on the best robe?
F.E.R. I should be inclined to think so. It is a question of laying hold of God's thoughts. It is God's pleasure, that Christ may dwell in our hearts by faith, and that the church should be the vessel of His glory.
Ques. Do we get it by faith?
F.E.R. I think it operates in that way -- it is not Christ personally. Take the illustration of a wife whose husband is absent from home. She has affection for him, but not only that -- she has also a picture of her husband in her mind. Now in the church there is the perfect picture of the Bridegroom. It is in the heart of the bride down here -- it is "by faith", for the simple reason that the bride is not where Christ is.
Rem. This was lost when the first love was lost.
{330}
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. What is "the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints", chapter 1.
F.E.R. Christ is "the head of all principality and power", and all that which is revived in Christ forms the inheritance of God. God's inheritance is everything which is revived in Christ. Why the inheritance is in the saints is because God's enjoyment of it is in them.
Rem. The saints are not the inheritance -- they are the heirs.
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. What is revived in Christ?
F.E.R. Everything is revived in Christ for God.
Ques. Why "revived"?
F.E.R. Because everything has, as it were, died -- Israel, the word of God, the nations, the temple, everything was deceased. In *Christ* everything revived.
Rem. Because of their association with Christ.
F.E.R. Exactly. The bride has her own proper place in affection, and she shares the inheritance -- the Head of all principality and power is Head of the church.
Rem. "After two days will he revive us".
F.E.R. That is it.
Rem. God never gives up what He has once brought in.
Ques. In saying that the word of God had died, do you mean that the prophetic word had ceased for a hundred years or more?
Rem. It could not be said that the Son of man found much faith on the earth.
F.E.R. No. In Matthew is the revival of *Israel* -- "Out of Egypt I called my son". In Mark it is the revival of the *word* -- 'They went everywhere preaching the word', 'The sower sowed the word'. The word was revived in Christ. In Luke it is the revival of the *nations* -- the Son of the Most High is "a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel", and the glad tidings were preached to all nations. In John we have
{331}
the revival of the temple -- "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up".
Ques. Why is that in John?
F.E.R. The Son of God is incarnate, and His body is the temple. Returning to @Ephesians 3, I think we can see that the church is only adequate as a witness as Christ is dwelling in the heart by faith.
Rem. The husband of the *virtuous* woman is "known in the gates".
F.E.R. Yes. The declaration of *union* is future -- union in its full sense is future. The church will be caught up.
Rem. The end of @John 3 -- "The Father ... hath given all things into his hand".
F.E.R. Yes, that is the Bridegroom.
Ques. Who is "the friend of the bridegroom"?
F.E.R. John the baptist.
Whatever God intends to set forth in Christ will come under Christ. All is connected with Him in the mind of the bride?
Ques. Are Isaac and Rebekah samples?
F.E.R. I think so. The power which God wrought in Christ is the power which is toward us. The Lord says, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up", "I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again". But it is also the exceeding greatness of His power toward *us*. It is impossible for Christ to be holden of death, and therefore it is the exceeding greatness of God's power towards us, wrought in Christ representatively.
Ques. Why representatively?
F.E.R. It is the exceeding greatness of His power towards us. God raised Him, not simply on His own account, but He raised Him on our account; the power of God wrought in Him towards us, and the point of it is that it is what puts us into the enjoyment of the inheritance. There are three chief points -- the hope of the calling, the glory of the inheritance, and the power
{332}
which puts us into it.
Rem. God had *us* in view in raising Christ, that we might be quickened with Him.
Ques. How is the church the 'fulness' of Christ?
F.E.R. It is what is adequate to set Him forth, just as a wife is adequate to set forth her husband. "The woman is the glory of the man". Eve was adequate to the setting forth of Adam, and the church is, in that way, adequate to set forth Christ. The "exceeding riches of his grace" is seen, not in Christ, but in the church.
"The Christ" is an expression referring to what stands in contrast with the whole system of the world. It represents *God's* system -- the whole system before God in which the glory of God will be displayed.
Rem. It is really the Man of all God's counsels and purposes. "The Christ" conveys that -- all the counsels and thoughts of God as they are going to be brought forth, all in "the Christ".
F.E.R. The church is the very one in whose heart "the Christ" dwells. Chapter 3: 17 - 19 is collective, although it is brought to pass by the work of God individually. In Colossians it is more limited -- more the thought of Christ in the saints morally.
Ques. Is verse 17 a moral preparation for verse 18?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so -- that ye "may be able to comprehend", etc.
Ques. Is it right to say that the resurrection of Christ from the dead is the great power of God?
F.E.R. Yes, the great power of God towards us. The point of the first prayer is that we may be conscious of what our portion is. That of the second is that there may be such a state in the church that God may be set forth, and it brings in the thought of the church as *witness*. The church is witness *now*. Christ comes out as the "*faithful* witness", but, after all, it comes out in the church. The truth of the "faithful and true witness" really comes out *after* the church is taken. The church has failed here, and Christ presents Himself as "the faithful and true
{333}
witness", and after that there comes out in display in the bride, "the exceeding riches of his grace". The church has failed, in this present time, in its responsibility, but then it will come out as a witness. "The glory which thou gavest me I have given them; ... that the world may *know* that thou hast sent me", etc. After all, the church comes out as the witness, that the world may know.
The great point for us now is the witness for God down here. The gospel would have no power without the witness. The church is the witness.
Rem. Through the defection of the church the gospel is greatly weakened.
F.E.R. Of course it is. The witness is in the power of the Spirit in the saints, and we ought to be able to appeal to it. "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another". You have an illustration of the witness of a heart that loved Christ in the woman who anointed His feet.
Ques. Is the conflict individual?
F.E.R. I do not think so. The church, as such, is claiming the inheritance now before going into it. We want our loins girt about with truth. We have to take up the position individually, but we all stand together as one man.
Ques. Will you say how we can practically claim the inheritance for Christ?
F.E.R. By separation from all the system in which the enemy of God has power.
Rem. By testimony, too.
F.E.R. Yes. The Lord rode into Jerusalem, claiming the inheritance in lowliness and testimony. We ought to stand here as a faithful wife, not only in separation to Christ, but denying ourselves many things which come within our reach. We want to be fasting now.
{334}
SALVATION AND RECONCILIATION
@Colossians 1: 1 - 29
F.E.R. I suppose the thought of salvation would precede that of reconciliation.
Ques. Do we not get that in verse 13?
F.E.R. Yes. Strictly speaking, salvation is connected with the coming of the Lord. Christ will "appear the second time without sin unto salvation". We await salvation in that sense.
Ques. Is salvation connected with the kingdom?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. What brings salvation into this world is the establishment of the kingdom.
Ques. Do you distinguish between present salvation and future?
F.E.R. I was only speaking strictly -- it must be connected with the coming of the Lord.
Rem. "Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls".
F.E.R. Yes. We get that in the present time.
Rem. "To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins". "God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ".
F.E.R. Exactly. "To obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him". We look for the Lord Jesus Christ as Saviour from the coming wrath -- not exactly salvation, but more *Christ as Saviour*. So in @Philippians 3 it is not exactly salvation; it is the Saviour, we wait for Him as Saviour.
Rem. "Now is our salvation nearer than when we believed".
F.E.R. It looks on to ultimate deliverance.
Ques. Does not the deliverance of Israel from Egypt present the good of salvation?
F.E.R. I think so. Salvation hangs on righteousness.
You cannot get salvation without that. It is "by the
{335}
remission of their sins" we get salvation.
Rem. The gospel is "the power of God unto salvation" because righteousness is there.
F.E.R. Yes. You are superior to the power of evil in the grace and strength of the Lord. That is where salvation comes in as a present reality, instead of being swallowed up by evil.
Ques. What is the force of "saved in hope" in @Romans 8?
F.E.R. No one could say he had salvation absolutely at the present time, so we are saved "in hope". As a matter of fact, we are here in responsibility, so we cannot talk about having salvation absolutely. You could not talk about salvation absolutely as long as the element of responsibility exists.
Ques. Can you say absolutely you are justified?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
Ques. Then why not the other, as far as you are concerned?
F.E.R. Scripture does not seem to attach it to us in that way.
Ques. How about @2 Timothy 1: 9 -- "Who hath saved us"?
F.E.R. Well, God has done that. You can accept that, you can stand in the truth of that. It is a very great thing to understand salvation, because then you really have a sense in yourself of the grace and strength of the Lord. You have acquaintance with the Lord.
Rem. It is realised now in appropriating Christ as Lord.
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. "With the mouth confession is made unto salvation". Confession is habitual. The practical result of the confession of Christ as Lord is that you stand in the grace and strength of the Lord.
Rem. "The name of the Lord is a strong tower".
Ques. "Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved". Is that characteristic?
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
{336}
Ques. What is "the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ"?
F.E.R. The apostle was very conscious of the support of the Spirit of Christ that he would not fail. He would be kept in faithfulness to the end, in spite of every effort to turn him aside. You prove the delivering power of God, and stand in the grace and strength of the Lord, because He is greater than all that can be against you.
Rem. Peter walking on the water was held up by the hand of the Lord.
F.E.R. Exactly. The water is that on which the power of evil acts, but you walk on the water as supported by the hand of grace and strength. All depends on the grace and strength of the Saviour. "My grace is sufficient for thee; for my strength is made perfect in weakness". A man ought to be able to give an answer to every one that asketh a reason of the hope that is in him.
Rem. If a man makes a confession, he ought to know what it is about.
F.E.R. I think so. Salvation is not growth, but a man grows up to it.
Ques. What is the force of soul-salvation?
F.E.R. It is in contrast to the temporal deliverance to which Israel had been accustomed. In the meanwhile, while we wait for full deliverance, we have soul-salvation.
Ques. What is the "gospel of your salvation" with regard to which the Holy Spirit was received?
F.E.R. It all refers to the salvation God had prepared for the gentiles. Salvation was there for the gentiles.
Ques. Of what does it consist?
F.E.R. Of man's liberation from the power of evil. Christ "gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil world". The provision of salvation in Christ is not only righteousness, but liberation from all the power of evil.
Ques. Is that salvation in @Romans 5: 10?
{337}
F.E.R. Yes, I think so. We are saved by the energy of His life. We are reconciled by His death, when He was in weakness. Now we are saved in the mighty energy of His life.
Ques. Is that @Titus 3: 5?
F.E.R. Yes. It is outward and inward, When the Lord comes again, He appears the second time unto salvation. All salvation in the present time, as to its effectuality, is through the Holy Spirit by Jesus Christ our Saviour.
Ques. What was the salvation of @Luke 7?
F.E.R. Liberation from the power of evil. The woman was manifestly a sinner, but really her faith saved her, and her faith brought her from under the power of evil, close to Jesus.
Ques. What is imminent for the sinner?
F.E.R. Judgment and the wrath of God. We have to do with men living in this world, and we are justified in pressing upon people that wrath is coming. We cannot tell *when* it will come, but it is coming. People ought to be warned of what is imminent. Wrath is declared, and that is what is imminent. I should have no hesitation in warning men that they are amenable to the judgment of God. "God shall judge the secrets of men". God will be the Judge of the conduct of every man, and every man will have to stand at the tribunal of God. We warn men of what is moral -- that man is amenable to the judgment of God. *God* is the Judge of men -- it is not a question of what is coming, *God* will be the Judge of man's conduct.
Rem. If ye "die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come".
F.E.R. Exactly.
Ques. You would not object to the preaching of the eternity of judgment?
F.E.R. It is often only trying to act on people's imagination. What acts on man's *moral* being is that *God* will be his Judge. It is not that the judgment of eternal punishment is not eternal, but it is often carried too far. Every man will have to stand before the judgment-seat
{338}
of Christ, that he may receive the things done in the body.
Ques. Would you not warn people of the great white throne?
F.E.R. God has revealed to christians the great end of things, that they may see the ultimate issues, and the working out of good and evil, but they are not to take advantage of that to work on men's imagination. It is quite enough to tell them that man is amenable to the judgment of God.
Ques. Is not eternal judgment mentioned in @Hebrews 6 as one of the first principles, as a foundation truth?
F.E.R. It comes in in contrast to the governmental dealings of God, to which Israel had been accustomed. What I mean is that you are not to expatiate on the *effects* of judgment. If you do, you only seek to affect the sensibilities of a *man*. What you want to do is to act on the conscience.
Rem. A preacher ought to enlighten a man, to enlighten his conscience, to tell him about *God*.
F.E.R. Exactly.
Ques. What about the end of @Mark 9?
F.E.R. It is a warning, in regard to the disciples, to walk in self-judgment.
Rem. But "knowing ... the *terror* of the Lord, we persuade men".
F.E.R. Very well, you *persuade* men, not terrify them. To think that man is amenable to the judgment of *God* is a very terrible thing, and knowing it, we persuade men.
Rem. You calculate to act on the conscience if a man is on moral ground. Nothing acts on man's conscience if he is not brought on to moral ground.
F.E.R. Exactly. In attempting to preach, the thing is to put God and man in their proper places. When Elihu comes to Job, he says, "God is greater than man. Why dost thou strive against him?" He put God and man in their proper, relative places.
Ques. In @John 5 as to the two resurrections, is that eternal judgment?
{339}
F.E.R. Yes.
Ques. "Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish", is not that the lake of fire?
F.E.R. But man *is* lost -- he is already perishing.
Ques. Does it not look on to the lake of fire?
F.E.R. I do not know.
Rem. The Lord Jesus warns them of the lake of fire. "How can ye escape the damnation of hell?"
F.E.R. Yes, but you would not like to take that ground instead of preaching the glad tidings. The fact is, man cannot enter into anything unless he comes under the moral sway of God in the kingdom.
Ques. What is "make thee wise unto salvation"?
F.E.R. It is akin to growing unto salvation. A man comes into it. As you go on every day you come much more into salvation, you grow up into it more. In present salvation it is taken into account where man is naturally in the eye of God, and God undertakes to save man out of that position.
Ques. What do you understand reconciliation to be?
F.E.R. Reconciliation is the changing of the man.
Ques. In speaking of moral ground, and the ground of the purpose of God, where does reconciliation come in?
F.E.R. Reconciliation, is the point of transit -- one man is ended, and distance removed. "God was *in Christ*, reconciling", not simply that 'God was reconciling'. It is reconciling in another Man, in *Christ*. The beginning of it was when Christ was on earth, God was in Christ. It was limited when Christ was here. It is greatly enlarged now, but it began then. "God was in Christ". There was complacency in the Man whom God put forward -- in Christ.
Rem. We have reconciliation in the thought of "new creation".
F.E.R. Undoubtedly. In removing the man after the flesh, Christ removed the distance. Not only is the *man* gone, but the *distance* is gone, and now "You ...
{340}
hath he reconciled", etc. You could not make one who is an enemy in nature unblameable, unreproveable, etc. New creation is brought in.
Rem. In @Romans 5 the contrast is shewn -- "If, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life".
F.E.R. It supposes you to be in the life of Christ.
Rem. Reconciliation is necessarily preparatory to worship.
F.E.R. Yes; you could not be a worshipper unless you were reconciled. Then there is a sense of divine complacency. The new covenant is the ministry of what God is to man, and reconciliation is what man is to God.
Ques. Is it the same person?
F.E.R. Yes -- "*You* ... hath he reconciled". It is most difficult to dissect things. The mind of God is all one with regard to each person, only we are not prepared, all in a moment, to accept it all. In the termination of man after the flesh, everything that was unsuitable to God went. In the body of His flesh man went, and with man the distance went, that we might be presented unblameable and unreproveable. It is impossible for a man to enter into everything in a moment, he must learn it bit by bit.
Ques. Is there the reconciliation of things later on?
F.E.R. Yes. Everything is taken up in Christ. He becomes the sun and centre of the universe of bliss, and God can rest in everything, because everything is taken up by Christ. The "restitution of all things" is when all is taken up by Christ. Peace has been made by the blood of Christ -- in the cross the whole question of sin has been met for God. Reconciliation involves complacency, and complacency brings you into the rest of God. It is not simply cessation of labour, but the idea of the rest of God is complacency in what He has created.
Rem. "He will rest in his love",
{341}
F.E.R. Yes, there is complacency.
Ques. Did you say we must understand reconciliation to be worshippers?
F.E.R. We must be in the reality of it. To be in the reality of it and in the intelligence of it go together.
Ques. Might we not be in the good of reconciliation without understanding it by that name?
F.E.R. The ministry of reconciliation is for the instruction of the saints. I wonder what amount of worship there was during the last thousand years of Israel's history, and yet it was said that praise waited for God in Zion. If you go back fifty or sixty years, what was there of *worship* then? All was formal, almost without exception, almost judaistic. There is little of it *now*.
Ques. What is the difference between reconciliation and new creation?
F.E.R. You could not possibly have the former without the latter. "God was in Christ", and that involves the new creation. "If any one has not the Spirit of Christ, *he* is not of him", and "if any one be in Christ, there is a new creation".
Ques. What is the force of being "in Christ"?
F.E.R. You are in Christ by the Spirit of Christ.
Ques. By the fact of having received the Spirit?
F.E.R. Yes. You have received the living word, and by virtue of that you are in Christ. A man in Christ is a partaker, so to speak, of the Spirit of Christ. He has given to us living water, and in virtue of that living water we are in Christ.
Ques. Would it be correct to say that new creation is begun in the saints by the Spirit?
F.E.R. Yes. I think so.
Ques. Would you say a word as to the different way in which "in Christ" is mentioned in @Romans 8 and @2 Corinthians 12?
F.E.R. In @Romans 8 the line of responsibility is still maintained, while in @2 Corinthians 12 the idea of responsibility does not come in. You apprehend "a man
{342}
in Christ" entirely out of the sphere of responsibility.
Rem. It is necessarily abstract.
F.E.R. Yes, it is. I should not talk about myself as "a man in Christ", but I should speak as Paul speaks of it, "I know a man in Christ". Every christian is in Christ, that is always true, but no christian is out of responsibility. If I talk of "a man in Christ", I speak of an abstract thought outside of responsibility.
Ques. What does 'outside of responsibility' convey?
F.E.R. A man in heaven. We have to bear in mind the distinction between Romans and 2 Corinthians on the one hand, and Ephesians and Colossians on the other. You get in the earlier epistles what is necessarily consequent on the way in which God has come out, but in Ephesians and Colossians you come on to the ground of purpose.
The apostle does not tell the Corinthians that they are men in Christ, he only says he *knows* such a man, and immediately he has to drop into responsible life, for "a man in Christ" hears unspeakable words which is not possible to utter down here.
Ques. Is there any point of difference between the allusions to reconciliation in Romans and Corinthians?
F.E.R. In Romans it is not developed it is just recognised. Virtually it is God saying, 'I am for you, and you are to be for Me'.
Ques. What is the "sword of the Spirit"?
F.E.R. It says, "the word of God".
Ques. How is it used?
F.E.R. It is the utterance of God. It is the stability of what God has uttered. What He utters endureth for ever.
Rem. It says we are to 'take' it.
F.E.R. Yes, we are to take it. There is the sense of the stability of the word of God. "The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the *word of our God* shall stand for ever".
{343}
THE LORD'S SUPPER
@Luke 23: 1 - 71; @Acts 2: 1 - 47; @1 Corinthians 11: 1 - 34
Ques. Is what Paul says of the Lord's supper in the epistle different from what we get in the gospel (Luke)?
F.E.R. No, except that in eating of the bread and drinking of the cup you announce the Lord's death until He come. I think that is the only difference.
Ques. When it says, "They continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine" (@Acts 2), does it mean they reached what Paul gives?
F.E.R. I think so; the doctrine was the foundation, and the fellowship, in a way, was founded on the doctrine. Then there was breaking of bread and prayers.
Ques. Is "breaking bread from house to house" the same thing?
F.E.R. Yes. It is translated 'at home'. 'They continued daily with one accord in the temple, and broke bread at home'.
Rem. They could not break bread in the synagogue.
F.E.R. No. Paul, when he writes, does not attempt to establish anything new, he simply recalls the original institution.
Ques. In what way has it come to be on the Lord's day only?
F.E.R. I think it is the rallying-point, and therefore we begin the week with it. We came back to the original institution.
Ques. What do you understand by "they continued"?
F.E.R. I think it is connected specially with the mission and testimony of the apostles. In a kind of way, Paul took it up where he found it.
Ques. Did they break bread because they were in fellowship?
F.E.R. Well, I do not know whether breaking of
{344}
bread was on that ground. I suppose they broke bread on the ground of the original institution.
Ques. It speaks of the apostles doctrine and fellowship, and then breaking of bread. Was that the apostles fellowship?
F.E.R. I think it is more the original institution.
Ques. I suppose the apostles doctrine would be the setting aside of Judaism.
F.E.R. I think so. It was the introduction of christianity.
Rem. Consequent on the death and resurrection of Christ.
Ques. What ground are we on, the new covenant or reconciliation?
F.E.R. Well, I think the essential point is that you want to be *in the good* of both the new covenant and reconciliation, in coming together.
Ques. I suppose we could hardly understand the assembly apart from the new covenant and reconciliation?
Ques. What is it to be in the good of the new covenant?
F.E.R. I think God has been pleased to lay down conditions in which we are to live, and they are set forth in the new covenant. If a man makes a will everything is changed, when he dies, with regard to his family. They do not live as they did previously; they have to live according to the conditions of the testator's will.
Rem. God's 'will' is His disposition towards us.
F.E.R. Yes. The disposition of a man makes a great deal of difference to his family -- everything is altered. I think that illustrates in a kind of way the new covenant. The death of the testator has come in, and consequently everything is changed. The disciples could no longer be in association with Christ after the flesh. Other conditions came in, on the death of Christ, and under these conditions they lived.
Rem. In @1 Corinthians 11 these conditions are
{345}
brought in. Two things are expressed in the Supper. There is removal of man, as such, and there is the expression of the love of God.
F.E.R. Yes. Everything closes in the death of Christ.
Rem. In the institution of the Supper by the Lord in @Luke 22 everything is anticipative.
F.E.R. Yes. I judge that, in the institution of the Supper, it is as if His death were passed.
Ques. Is there not a difference in this respect, that the disciples had had to do with the Lord *before* His death, whereas we *start* with that?
F.E.R. We must remember that the death of Christ interpreted His life. I do not think we can properly understand His life until we understand His death. I think that the principles on which the Lord acted during His life were what came out in His death. It was not that His life was on one principle and His death on another.
Rem. His death was a sort of climax.
F.E.R. I think it was. All His life was really the expression of God's love towards man. It came out more distinctly in His death, but at the same time, His life had that character. "God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son". He was the expression of God's love to man.
Rem. He began the "ministry of reconciliation".
F.E.R. As regards the assembly, I do not think it goes back in its 'calling to mind' of Christ in the same way as the disciples did who had walked with the Lord in the days of His flesh. In its institution, the assembly anticipates the future.
Rem. It begins at the other side of death, and you cannot rightly go back.
F.E.R. The thought of the assembly brings you to the promised land. You do not get the assembly except on the other side of Jordan. Hence you do not get the assembly until you come to Colossians. Colossians is on the other side of Jordan.
{346}
Rem. It is our resurrection with Him "through the faith of the operation of God". We are raised with Him.
Rem. That is not going back.
F.E.R. The operation of God which raised Him from the dead has reference to the future. The whole of God's ways *in display* are founded on resurrection.
Ques. Would you say that, in thought, we go back as individuals when we partake of the Lord's supper?
F.E.R. You may go back as individuals, but there is a great deal belonging to us as individuals which is not appropriate to the assembly. It is important to distinguish between the order for the assembly and what is right for us as individuals.
Rem. We have to go back, in a certain sense, as individuals connected with the responsible life here.
F.E.R. You can dwell upon many things individually which are inappropriate to the assembly.
Rem. You do not bring the assembly into the wilderness.
Rem. No, nor the wilderness into the assembly.
F.E.R. For instance, there is a great deal in the Psalms for us as individuals, but you do not exactly want to bring the Psalms into the assembly.
Ques. When you speak of going back in memory of His death, do not the bread and the wine carry us back to His death?
F.E.R. I think you want to take up His death in its moral and continuous import, and not simply the fact of it. You take it up in its order and import -- you announce the Lord's death until He come. The whole of this period is marked by His death. We are supposed to be in the secret of it, therefore we can announce it.
{347}
Rem. As you have said, it is still the night of His betrayal.
F.E.R. That is our condition until He come, but you cannot announce it until it is true to you.
Rem. You must be in the fellowship of His death before you can announce it.
F.E.R. Everyone ought to be there. It is not the mere fact of it, but everyone ought to be in accord with it.
Ques. Is it not true that some of us take it up in a merely natural sense, as we would some past event? The idea with many is that we go back and remember certain events which have happened.
F.E.R. I think the great point is that we should understand that we come together in *assembly*. We do not come together exactly to eat the Supper; the point is we come as in the assembly, and therefore it is of the last moment that we should understand the assembly.
Rem. The Supper leads us to that.
F.E.R. We come together and eat the Supper, and, *in* a certain way, it is the rallying-point -- the start -- but, I think, properly, we come to meet the Lord.
Rem. The Lord is "on the other side", and we reach Him.
F.E.R. The conditions should be such as suit the Lord, I think that is the point -- not what suits ourselves or others, but what suits the Lord. If that were accepted, it would have a great effect upon us.
Ques. How can we reach that? It is not reached by effort.
F.E.R. I think, in order to reach it, you must come under divine teaching. That is where the new covenant comes in. Some one may ask what divine teaching is. It is a difficult thing to describe it. Divine teaching is what forms you for the assembly. God did not leave His people in Egypt -- He brought them to the abode of His holiness. It is there they came under divine teaching. The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit. God's purpose in bringing us into salvation is that we may come under divine teaching, so that He may prepare us for the sanctuary.
Rem. You have said that we do *not* come together to break bread.
F.E.R. The great point is to come together as in
{348}
assembly. I think the Supper is the rallying-point of the assembly, and, in that sense, we do come together to break bread.
Ques. Do we come into the light of the assembly?
F.E.R. I think you come together in the *light* of it, and to meet the Lord. It seems to me, in coming together to the Supper, we announce the conditions under which the Lord can be with us. It really forms a kind of test as to our minds being in accord with His death. His death sets forth the conditions on which the Lord will come in.
Ques. Do we break bread in assembly?
F.E.R. Oh yes.
Rem. You were saying the Supper is the rallying point.
Rem. Someone has said it is introductory.
F.E.R. It is both.
Rem. It is said we lose our individuality, but not our identity.
Rem. In breaking of bread, we commit ourselves to death.
F.E.R. I do not think you commit yourself to it. You witness that your mind is in accord with *His* death.
Rem. I suppose it is the witness of what you have been committed to. We announce His death as in assembly.
Rem. It separates us from everything here.
Rem. We are not in the assembly as individuals.
F.E.R. It is collective. "We being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread".
Rem. I was thinking as to things connected with our present life, family ties and such things. When we come together in assembly, His death separates us from it all. We come into a new scene. We ought to lose ourselves in occupation with the Lord Jesus. If the sovereign were to come into the assembly gathering, he would have the same place as anybody else, but directly he leaves he is a sovereign again.
{349}
Ques. Were they as intelligent in @Acts 2 as in @1 Corinthians 11 with reference to the breaking of bread?
F.E.R. I should think more so. I mean in Acts they were more immediately under the influence of the Spirit.
Rem. The Corinthians were not in a good condition.
F.E.R. But in Acts, they were directly under the power of the Spirit. That, I believe, gives character to the Acts.
Ques. Would the "apostles doctrine" include the new covenant and reconciliation?
F.E.R. Well, I do not know. It came out more fully afterwards.
Rem. It is not exactly the teaching of Paul in @Acts 2. He had not come upon the scene; but, being under the power of the Spirit, they were in the good of things which we sometimes are not.
Ques. Was 'fellowship' the enjoyment of that which was outside judaism?
F.E.R. I think so. They had not outwardly broken with judaism -- they were continuing in the temple, but evidently the doctrine of the apostles had bound them together in some special way.
Ques. Would the Lord's desire to eat the passover with them have special reference to the Supper?
F.E.R. I think it was in connection with the kingdom. The Lord says, "I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God". Of course, we know that not one thing God has established will fail -- the feast of weeks, the feast of tabernacles, all must have its fulfilment in the kingdom. I think it is the kingdom of the future.
Rem. More for the Jews than for us.
F.E.R. Quite so. Then I think there is a kind of transition in the chapter -- the Lord passes away from the passover to the Supper. I see more and more the suitability of announcing the Lord's death until He come, if we believe in Christ at all.
Ques. What is the force of announcing His death?
{350}
F.E.R. Well, I think you announce the import of it. You announce the conditions on which the Lord came into the world. We begin with this, that God will not endure one single thing that belongs to the flesh. "This is my body ... given for you". That is the end of the glory of man; that is one condition. Then, on the other hand, we must acknowledge that He has made known the love of God. This is the point of the new covenant. I think it is a mistake to limit the new covenant to the Jew. I admit the covenant is established with the Jew, but, at the same time, I believe the principle of it is for everyone.
Rem. It is "all shall know me".
F.E.R. I think it is established with a particular people, but it is for the good of man universally.
Rem. The new covenant has been brought to pass in Christ. He would have us in the good of it now, while we wait for its full accomplishment.
F.E.R. Yes, I think so.
Rem. He is not limited in His goodness to the Jew. The new covenant is according to the nature of God, and it cannot be limited.
Ques. The words in 2 Corinthians, "if one died for all, then were all dead", and "henceforth know we no man after the flesh" -- do they involve the same principle?
F.E.R. I think so. I think that is what the Lord sets forth in "This is my body ... given for you". "The kingdom of God is ... righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit". You cannot imagine such a thing as the Lord putting any sanction on man in the flesh, or on man's glory. Principalities and powers -- everything -- will have to take their character from Christ. He "is the head of all principality and power".
Rem. @Ezekiel 21 shews it. "I will overturn, overturn, overturn". Everything of man's glory comes to an end.
F.E.R. The pride of man shall be humbled, and
{351}
the haughtiness of man brought low.
Rem. We have to apply that to ourselves now.
F.E.R. Meanwhile it is written, "now light in the Lord; walk as children of light".
Rem. That excludes the flesh.
F.E.R. If it excludes the flesh, it brings in the Lord. If it excludes the old covenant, it brings in the new. Nothing of *man* can live there. Man in the flesh rejects it, repels it. Talk to an unconverted man of the love and mercy of God, he does not understand it. These are not the conditions under which man lives. He is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.
Ques. Would you say that, in taking the bread and wine, we accept these conditions, and enter the assembly?
F.E.R. You witness that your mind is in accord with them,
Rem. You are in accord with what you are committed to in baptism.
Rem. The history of the flesh is closed in death.
F.E.R. I think the great point in coming into the assembly is to be entirely done with ourselves. That is the effect of the teaching of the new covenant.
Ques. Would you say a little more about being in accord with the Lord's death?
F.E.R. It involves that I take the place of being in the Spirit. I do not eat the bread as in the flesh, but as in the Spirit. The bread signifies something to me, and that something I understand in the Spirit. I have proof within myself that in the death of Christ, man, as such, is set aside. It is not that I get the Spirit by the truth, but I get the truth because I have the Spirit. The proof of it to me is that I have the Spirit. It is not that you have to learn the disposition of God towards you; it is that you are in the good of it. You can take the Supper very happily in that way.
Rem. In entering into the new covenant, your mind is in fellowship with the death of Christ.
F.E.R. I do not think people generally come very
{352}
much under divine teaching. They know doctrine, and that kind of thing, but they have not come, to any extent, under divine teaching. A man may be well informed, without being a man divinely taught. The latter does not necessarily follow. I do not think you know God by understanding scripture; it is rather that you understand scripture by knowing God.
Rem. It is important to bear in mind that the Lord was about to leave the world.
F.E.R. He had come to the end of His ministry, and was about to suffer. He institutes the Supper to bring before the minds of the disciples the conditions under which He could come to them during His absence.
Ques. The words, "I will come to you" -- do they involve that the disciples were to be in accord with Him?
Ques. How does the Lord come in in connection with the Supper?
F.E.R. I think the love of the Lord comes in in connection with the assembly.
Ques. Not as regards our individual salvation?
F.E.R. The very things you partake of witness to *His* love. It was His pleasure to give His body; it was His pleasure to give His blood. As I said before, what a great thing it would be if we could lose sight of ourselves, and have the Lord before us.
Ques. Why does the cup come before the bread in @1 Corinthians 10?
F.E.R. It is more God's side in that chapter.
Rem. There was joy.
F.E.R. Yes. "Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord". When you come together, the Lord brings before you the record of His death, and you greatly rejoice because your mind is in accord with it. I believe those are the conditions under which the Lord will come in.
Rem. You do not rejoice merely because your sins are put away, but you enter into His love.
Rem. The announcing His death is not going back.
{353}
F.E.R. I do not think it is going back. I believe the great announcing of His death will be when He comes.
Ques. "This do in remembrance of me" -- is there any going back there?
F.E.R. Well, I think there was in the case of the disciples. They had known Him in life. In His death, I think the Lord gives them the way to His life.
Ques. Do we not know His life by His death? It is that which speaks to us.
F.E.R. "This is my body ... given for you" -- that is the expression of His love, but it is a love that abides. "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends". Love had its expression then, but it is continuous. You come into the presence of that love in the Supper.
Ques. Supposing some child, or some young believer, says, 'Is it necessary I should learn all this?' You would not discourage him?
F.E.R. No, I would not, although, at the same time, I do not at all agree with young people taking up things lightly. We have to remember that, when they come into the assembly, they put themselves under the responsibility of the assembly. Aaron and his sons were charged with the iniquity of the assembly. It is all right for young people if they have faith for it, but they have to remember what it brings them under. I would not hinder them -- far from it -- but they must remember that they become identified, in a way, with the Supper. You become identified with the priesthood.
Ques. Is it in breaking of bread they get the good of it?
F.E.R. I think they get the good of it in the congregation, but do not always appreciate the responsibility. Mr. Darby used to say a person breaking bread casually was as much amenable to assembly discipline as anyone.
Rem. You never get in scripture the question of sin raised in connection with the assembly. If it is raised, it must be in connection with the individual.
{354}
F.E.R. Exactly.
Ques. I was going to ask a question -- suppose a young soul, a young believer, has a real sense of the Lord's love to him in giving Himself; and has before him the Lord's words, do this "in remembrance of me", and desires to do it, would not that be sufficient?
F.E.R. It is not remembering it *materially*. I think it is a mistake to take it up in that way. Sometimes it is taken up sentimentally. I do not think sentiment has a place in divine things.
Ques. Do you not think love responds to love in that way? That is, affection for Him would respond to His love for them.
F.E.R. I think affection for Christ would wish to be identified with Him.
Rem. The eunuch was prepared for the assembly.
Rem. You mean that when he saw that "his life is taken from the earth" he went and buried himself.
{355}
THE PRACTICAL WORKING OF THE ASSEMBLY, ON THE PRINCIPLE OF UNITY.
@1 Corinthians 12: 1 - 31
C.G. We should like to read something on the assembly.
F.E.R. Then we had better look at @1 Corinthians 12 - 14. These chapters do not bring before us the idea of the saints as risen and quickened with Christ, as in Colossians and Ephesians, but the practical working of the assembly on the principle of unity. We have what may be called the first principles of the assembly. Chapter 11 virtually gives the Head, for it is the Lord who is prominent there, and He is the Head. Chapter 12 gives the body, for it brings in the truth of the Spirit, and one Spirit makes one body.
W.B. Is Christ the Head as the One to whom the body is subject?
F.E.R. Yes.
A.H. Does Head and Lord convey the same thought?
F.E.R. No, but we distinguish the Person who is Head by the title of Lord. As Lord, Christ holds Himself in a sense distant. He did so to the Corinthians because of their state. The moment you recognise Christ as Head, you understand that you take your character from the Head. The secret of the confusion in the world is from lack of a Head.
Rem. Antichrist will be given that place by Satan.
F.E.R. He comes on the scene after Christ, the true Head, has been refused. Christ is Head of every man, but now this is true only to faith. In a system like popery they try to impose a head, but it is not the true thing. In Adam, God began with a head: he was the first man and the head. We have in the assembly the introduction of the Head before the body. The way in which God put things right is by the introduction of a head. (@Ephesians 1: 22)
{356}
The idea of a head is one from whom character is taken. When things are in order according to God, every man, instead of asserting his own will, will take character from Christ. "Such as the heavenly one, such also the heavenly ones". If every man took character from Christ, things would be right in the world. My body takes character from my head, for the intelligence is there. All the confusion in the world, the separation into nations, and confusion of tongues arose from the fact that man had lost a head; everything was marred, and man went his own way. In coming together in the assembly we own Christ as Head.
Rem. If Christ were realised as Head, everything would go right in the assembly.
F.E.R. Yes; but I should like to see that every one took character from Christ; then we should have wonderful meetings.
Chapter 11 virtually presents Christ; chapter 12 the Spirit, by which Jew and gentile have been baptised into one body. The Spirit into which we have all been made to drink is, I judge, Christ, from whom we take character.
Ques. "The Christ" (verse 12) -- what is that?
F.E.R. The church as the anointed vessel. That is the true place of the church here.
W.B. In what way is the Lord brought before us in the Supper?
F.E.R. In His death, the Supper gives Him His proper place of pre-eminence; He claims pre-eminence, but in love. He has taken the place of "first-born" that we might accord Him this place of pre-eminence. He is Head of all principality and power. We own and recognise Him as Head of every man and of all principality and power. The church is His body and He is Head to it.
Ques. In chapter 11, when the bread and cup are before us, what do they convey?
F.E.R. You find yourself in the presence of the Lord's death, the greatest expression of His love. In the bread and cup He sets forth the conditions on which we
{357}
can have part with Him.
J.C. And that holds good the whole week through.
F.E.R. Yes.
W.B. Some think the breaking of bread to be the stirring up of your pure mind by way of remembrance.
F.E.R. But you have not known His sufferings in order to remember or recall them in the way in which the apostles would, you have to take the institution up spiritually rather than literally.
Rem. The Lord said, do this "in remembrance of me".
F.E.R. I think He referred in that to what He had been here when with the disciples, and they were to recall Himself. To us, the bread and wine, as setting forth His death, give us the expression of His love, and Christ has given in them, too, the conditions under which we can be with Him.
Ques. The bread and cup recall His death?
F.E.R. They recall Himself. You have to go behind the bread and cup, for the Supper calls Himself into presence; and that is more even than laying down the terms on which He can be with us. Many get the good of His presence though not much in the intelligence of it. The Jew had no more title to Christ in death than the gentile, whatever he might have had in His life. Thus Jew and gentile are on common ground in the presence of the death of Christ.
W.B. I think of Him in all He died to put away, all that I was after the flesh, in order that He might have us with Himself in all the love He expressed there.
F.E.R. That is the force of His body given, the removal side; the cup is the cup of blessing. It does not speak of the *bread* of blessing, because that refers to removal. The Supper is introductory to the sanctuary, to the priestly service of God, according to the appointed order.
T.P. As to the Supper being at the beginning of the meeting, it would not do to force things?
{358}
F.E.R. No. You must recognise when saints are ready for it spiritually; but you will not find much good will be done by putting off the breaking of bread.
J.C. But you would not make rules?
F.H.B. No. Chapter 13 comes in to regulate all. Love regulates everything. In @John 20 when the Lord came into the company of His disciples, He brought before them the record of His death. He shewed them His hands and His side. "Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord". His hands and His side identified Him as the One who had died.
B.B. Chapter 13 comes in for us to have consideration for those who may not be up to the truth of things.
F.E.R. Yes; the Corinthians were not much up to the truth.
A.H. You would deprecate an unwritten church service?
F.E.R. Yes, but we ought to try and help saints to that which is true, namely, priestly worship. In regard to this, Hebrews and Colossians go together, that is, in Colossians you apprehend God's work in us, namely, that He has quickened us together with Christ; and in Hebrews we have boldness to enter into the holiest. You must connect the holiest with the land of promise. The greater and more perfect tabernacle is in the land.
Rem. The tabernacle was set up at Shiloh.
F.E.R. The greater and more perfect tabernacle is connected with mount Zion, but it is all, of course, a moral idea, and is realised in our apprehending the place which Christ has taken up before God on our behalf. If you understand what being quickened together with Christ and raised up is, you enter into association with Christ in the holiest.
Ques. Is Christ's presence the holiest, for it is not a place?
F.E.R. Yes; but the point in Colossians is the apprehension of what God has wrought -- what is true in us; quickening is what God has effected in us. As quickened
{359}
together with Christ, we are in the land, in association there with Him.
Ques. Why is it "in Christ"?
F.E.R. Because we are not actually in heavenly places yet. We are there in Christ.
J.C. I am there before God in Christ, and as Christ is.
F.E.R. You are there before God as *you* are, according to what God has made you. Everything in the holiest is according to God's glory. You are there according to that glory -- holy, without blame before Him in love. In the holiest there is a power of exclusion of everything in us which is not according to God's work in us. We are true worshippers because we are there according to what God has wrought in us. At the coming of the Lord we shall be actually quickened and raised up, but that is effected in us now in anticipation. There is the work of God, and you are in the holiest in virtue of that work.
A.H. Not only *in* Christ, but *of* Christ, as Eve was *of* Adam.
F.E.R. Yes.
J.C. Then it is really all that is of God in me that enters.
F.E.R. Yes. These things are said by many to be mystical, but they are only mystical to those who do not understand them.
Ques. What is quickening?
F.E.R. It is making alive out of death.
Ques. When is that true?
F.E.R. When the love of God is so effective in the soul that you are conscious of being associated with Christ in that love.
Ques. Is it progressive?
F.E.R. Quickening is really the sum total of God's work in us.
Ques. Does not the quickening process go on if the person is clear of the world?
F.E.R. Well, it enlarges. The secret of deliverance
{360}
lies in the divine nature. @2 Peter 1: 4.
Rem. Quickening is more than intelligence?
F.E.R. In scripture spiritual intelligence is connected with love. See @Ephesians 1 and @Colossians 2.
Ques. As to the holiest -- Is the idea of it that we realise heavenly association with Christ where love has found its rest and satisfaction?
F.E.R. Yes. The love we have learned in its activities down here in discipline, and in other ways, is there at rest. It is the same love which we experienced here that we find there at rest. There is a place where everything is according to God, and *there* is found perfect love in complacency and at rest. We read in @John 17: 26, "that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them?"
Rem. In Corinthians we do not find much of this.
F.E.R. No, they were not up to it, the tendency with them was to party making.
Rem. You said that Corinthians was a contrast to Hebrews and Colossians. How?
F.E.R. In Hebrews and Colossians we get the idea of the assembly in its true character according to God. In Corinth they were party making, going after leaders. In the assembly there is no such thing as leadership or pre-eminence. In your natural body there is no pre-eminence, your finger is as good as your eye. No member in the human body seeks prominence, though on the other hand it might be paralysed, and die out of use. You have to be particular in the assembly as to conduct, no person should express judgment on what is done there -- it is a very unhappy position for any brother to place himself in, for he makes himself judge.
J.C. If on the one hand a person is not to make himself prominent, many, on the other hand, do not take any part at all.
F.E.R. Chapter 13 would correct that. Love is an active principle which would bring to the front many who do not now take part. It is a lack of love, rather than
{361}
a question of modesty.
Ques. Is there not a fear of criticism?
F.E.R. Well, love would lead a man to forget himself; to correct all these things our hearts must get into the scene and region of love; one cannot correct them for another.
P. Do you not think prayer about it would effect it?
F.E.R. Yes, for that would bring out the love.
B.B. If love were manifested would it not bring it out in others?
F.E.R. Yes, love is the life of the assembly, and Christ claims to be pre-eminent in love. The Supper puts that before us.
Rem. If we were formed in love there would not be such long pauses.
Ques. Do you not think that the real defect in all of us is that we are not affected by the love of God, not that we do not know about it?
F.E.R. Do you think that if love were in activity there would be these horrible divisions coming in? Doctrine will not correct these things, but divine love would; but for its acting, people must keep themselves in the region of the Spirit, not in the influence of the world.
A.H. If a person is quickened with Christ he must be of Christ, nothing of the flesh could be quickened.
Rem. It is new creation.
F.E.R. That stands in rather a different connection.
{362}
THE MAINTENANCE OF HOLINESS IN THE ASSEMBLY AND IN THE BELIEVER'S BODY
@1 Corinthians 5 and 6
F.E.R. The great point in the two chapters is the maintenance of holiness in the assembly and in the believer's body. The Corinthians had to be awakened to the obligation in regard of both. No fellowship is either suited to, or worthy of God apart from holiness. The body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, and ye are "not your own ... therefore glorify God in your body". In the existing state of christendom, it is difficult to understand chapter 5. It is impossible that the obligation of chapter 5 could be felt in christendom on account of the general ordering of things in it. The apostle put upon the Corinthians the obligation of acting; I think he stayed away that they might act. The apostle passes away, but the obligation to fellowship remains. If we take the ground, or are in the light of the assembly, you have to accept the obligation. "Remove the wicked person from amongst yourselves". People soon get leavened if evil be allowed; they get accustomed to it and so become demoralised. I do not think they were leavened, but they had not proved that they were unleavened.
Ques. "... deliver him, ... to Satan"?
F.E.R. In the way of discipline; I suppose there was authority in the hand of the apostle in that way. Even in the congregation of Israel, the obligation to holiness was maintained, in a fleshly way, I admit, still it was maintained. Here the charge is different from that in 2 Timothy; *here* it is purge out, but *there* it is to purge yourself. The latter is necessary when the first becomes impossible. It is a great mercy that we have got scripture and thus we have positive authority for purging ourselves *from*. The scripture cannot be broken
{363}
and therefore it is a great mercy to have authority in that way to purge ourselves from. The passover is taken up and that, I think, is a great point. The feast of unleavened bread was connected with the passover. The one followed the other. The passover was not exactly a feast, but the feast of unleavened bread hung upon the passover. The passover is the witness of God's righteousness, the witness that Christ has been into death; the blood was the witness of God's righteousness. If the righteousness of God is declared, we cannot sanction that which God has condemned, and therefore we can see the suitability of our keeping the feast of unleavened bread. Keeping the feast is characteristic. They kept it seven days, and that includes every day, the complete period of a man's life.
We have to accept as christians that we are to be in accord with the righteousness of God, "with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth". Nothing is more important than to apprehend the intensely moral character of christianity; it is neither dogmas nor institutions. God's righteousness is revealed and we are to be in accord with that. The passover refers to the death of Christ as the declaration of God's righteousness. I do not think it is a reference to the Lord's supper; it alludes to the same thing to which the Supper alludes, that is the death of Christ. But whether we had the Lord's supper or not, it would remain true "our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed". The two things go together: the more we are instructed in righteousness, the better we understand His love.
The new covenant gives two things: the ministry of righteousness and of the Spirit. The new covenant is a will -- God's will; He makes known not only what we receive, forgiveness of sins, but the declaration of His mind towards us -- expressing His mind. We thus come under divine teaching. That is the idea to me of the new covenant and the principle of the new covenant is in every christian; he may not have come under the power
{364}
of it. "The mind of the Spirit life and peace" and you could not get these save as in the light of divine love. The Holy Spirit when given (@Romans 5) gives the consciousness of divine love; no one enters on the reality or domain of life until he gets the sense of the love of God. But that does not alter the fact that from the very beginning God's disposition towards His people was love. I do not think the Corinthians had got so far as that. In chapter 13 the apostle brings before them the first principles of the gospel, and in the opening of the second epistle he brings before them the ministry of the new covenant and that of reconciliation. The work of the Spirit, as in the case of the Galatians, had been greatly hindered in the Corinthians.
What we get in chapter 5 is very elementary, "celebrate the feast ... with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth". Christianity is morally sound and wholesome; the world is unsound and unwholesome. People pretend they have seen otherwise, but the truth is, they have gone to that which is morally unwholesome. What we get in this chapter is that they were to *judge*; but the church does not judge an act as is the case in a court of law; we judge an *actor* -- the person who is a railer or drunkard, etc. If a man's course is such that he can be so characterised, then he has to be judged. If a person is "put out", he is put out as being unworthy of christian fellowship. If the *act* is to be judged, it is turning the assembly into a human tribunal. The wicked person is to be put away from among yourselves. Discipline is an impossibility in the present state of things in christendom. Among dissenters they are obliged to be partial; in the Church of England there is no such thing.
Ques. Is this connected with @Matthew 18, "Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven"?
F.E.R. Yes, I think it is. Discipline is the other occasion besides the Lord's supper when the assembly can be convened. God could not have gone on with
{365}
the people if Achan had not been stoned. If God is there, how can there be the allowance of sin? The Corinthians did not condone the sin in their midst, but they seemed indifferent to it. The apostle says "Put away, etc". and that means you are not to eat with him, nor have any link which would be an expression of fellowship. It has been said 'you have to bandage your eyes', that is you are not to see them. Of course it is not final; for the object is *restoration*. It is a great proof of the grace of the Lord in a meeting if He brings to light evil, for then it comes on the conscience of the assembly and they can clear themselves. Whether an assembly know of evil or not, they are hindered and affected by it.
{366}
THE WAY IN WHICH GOD ACTS TOWARDS US
@1 Corinthians 1: 1 - 31
I think it is a wonderful thing for us to prove the way in which God is pleased now to act towards us. In all our minds, until we are set right by the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, we think God requires us to be something. No one here would think of looking anywhere for salvation but in the Lord Jesus Christ. Everything there depends entirely on what has been wrought by the Lord Jesus -- it is the foundation of the faith of the soul for eternity. There faith rests entirely for eternity, as on the solid rock that cannot be moved -- on the finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ.
It is when we come to the christian pathway that we make mistakes. The moment Israel really were brought into the truth of redemption, then began the wilderness pathway where they were tested. The great point of the testing was, were their hearts really towards God?
I need not say they broke down. The object of the pathway is testing; it is there where we often have an idea of a kind of requirement. While it is here that responsibility attaches to us, the great matter of responsibility is, that I have not the slightest confidence in myself. There are "ifs" -- "if we live by the Spirit, let us walk also by the Spirit". But if there are "ifs" with regard to our responsible life down here, it is not if *you* do anything -- it is not that you and I can walk through the wilderness in any strength of our own. The contrast is brought out in the gospel of Matthew, chapter 21: 33, the parable referred to their responsibility. "There was a householder who planted a vineyard ... and let it out to husbandmen ... But when the time of fruit drew near, he sent his bondmen to the husbandmen to receive his fruits". He sent his servants to demand the fruit -- there was responsibility. That was the way in which God
{367}
regarded the system of judaism, but there is nothing such as that in christianity -- the fruit must come from God, but you do not get that in the parable of the husbandmen, they did not yield the fruits. When the final point came, it was found that their hearts were really enmity against God. They slew His servants, and when the Son came they said "This is the heir; come, let us kill him and possess his inheritance". There is the end of responsibility and it only brings out that in the heart of man there is enmity against God and that came out in the slaying of His own dear Son.
You might say, "But that is what the Jews did, you do not mean to say that I would do it?" No, I do not believe you would, but if you have learned your own heart, you would know that your flesh would. If you were to walk according to flesh, I do not know where you would get to. It was their walk through the wilderness that gives us to learn that. When Israel came to the brazen serpent, after forty years of the wilderness experience, the flesh in them was just as bad as at the beginning. That showed what the flesh was, and the great thing for us is to have no confidence in the flesh. Where you really learn it best is in the death of the Lord Jesus Christ.
The parable I referred to first is followed by another where you do not get anything about man's responsibility, but God acting according to His own pleasure -- @Matthew 22, "A king who made a wedding feast for his son". The great point was the pleasure God had in His Son, and that is the other side of the matter. God did not say to man, 'There is My beloved Son and you ought to love Him', He says 'There is My beloved Son and I love Him'. "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased". The moment you get to that you are entirely off the ground of responsibility. God will invite guests to come and see the love He has got for His Son, and if the question of fitness comes in, God provides the fitness -- everybody can come. When
{368}
we get to heaven, what it will be to see the delight God has in His Son! That is what we are invited to -- they invited whoever they found.
Now God deals entirely on that ground. We may say responsibility comes in this way -- if one of those comes in he must come in suited to Him who made the feast. If he comes in, he is bound to come in suitably clad. But, beloved friends, all is provided -- that is what we get in Romans. God does not come demanding righteousness, He brings it. His attitude is not that of demanding, that is all over. If God demands a thing under the most favourable circumstances, He gets nothing. Take @Luke 13, the barren fig-tree, "Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree and find none". Israel had been under the culture of the Lord for three years, and He comes seeking fruit and finds none, and therefore that question of responsibility is entirely over. "Cut it down; why does it also render the ground useless". The fig-tree is wild and has the curse of the Lord Jesus. It is all Israel, and Israel represents man in the flesh.
Now we have altogether another thing and all is of His grace, the blessed God comes in and provides what man has not got, that is righteousness. Man is set in life and righteously set there. Now that is God's grace, grace works towards us -- how blessed! The question of proving all ends in this, that man is unable to meet God in any way, and if it be to provide righteousness, God provides it. So that not only can I see in the cross of Christ how He establishes grace, but, beloved friends, more than that, righteousness was established. @Romans 5: 18 reads, "so then as it was by one offence towards all men to condemnation, so by one righteousness towards all men for justification of life:" one great act of righteousness in contradistinction to one great act of sin. It forms the basis upon which all the grace of God flows out towards us. That righteousness subsists in heaven, in the Person of Him who established it. It
{369}
is most blessed to see how the grace of God flows out to us on the ground of God's subsisting righteousness.
Now here we find another thing (verse 2); these Corinthian saints are looked at as the assembly of God down here. That is a common thing the believers now are granted this privilege to be the assembly of God. We might say that we do not know where to find it, but it is a great thing to see that God did establish down here that which He could call His assembly, that when the Lord Jesus Christ was crucified and cast out of this world there was a company called His assembly in which was the testimony of Christ.
A great deal has been said of late to us about the word 'Come'. Now that word will finally be Christ, He who is now hidden in the heavens will come out again. There will be nothing in the coming age that will not bear the stamp of Christ. The whole kingdom will be one word -- "Christ". If I look at that, the fulness of the gospel is to preach the unsearchable riches of the Christ. That was the great thing that the apostle Paul was entrusted with. God could say, 'I have a Son, an only-begotten Son, I love Him -- the whole delight of My heart is in Him, I have made Him heir of everything. Now I love to tell you of that One' -- that is the gospel. I know He tells us about His work, He must tell us about that, He tells us what He has done, but the great burden of the gospel is His Son, it is the gospel of God concerning His Son, and would He not tell everybody what is in His Son? God would speak to man about His Son and that is the great prime thing of the gospel.
Another thing God committed to Paul was the church; the church had the testimony of the Christ confirmed in it (verses 6 and 7) awaiting the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. That is the moment when the heavens will be opened to unveil all the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ, and that formed the mystery of the gospel. Think of it, beloved friends, when all that is veiled will come out in display, and the church is the
{370}
testimony of that Christ who is to come out then.
Now I have spoken of the failure of the church, and we can see from scripture how the church has failed. You must see how largely the coming of the Lord Jesus was enjoyed amongst the saints in the early days, but the church has forgotten what is in the heavens and has ceased to be the witness down here of the riches that are in Christ which she had had the knowledge of, but thank God we have been aroused a little, "awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ" -- there is no time stated. Supposing there had been in scripture a day set when the Lord Jesus should come, what would be the effect on souls? They would say, 'The Lord is not coming yet, we need not trouble ourselves about that'. But there is no excuse for the church going on with the world. The thing to me is, not 'when' the Lord is coming. His coming is not a matter of time. Dear friends, morally that is of no consequence. The nearness is this -- not of time but of affection, that the coming of the Lord is near to our hearts, that we love His appearing, not that we can calculate His appearing, but love it and thus the Lord's coming is near. Now it is so with us here, that all those unsearchable riches of the Christ are hidden in the heavens, and the church is made the testimony of it.
Now verse 4, "the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus". I want you to see the way in which we are set in complete privilege, not in demand at all, and all the privilege in our Lord Jesus Christ -- not a question of "through" Him but "in" Him. And again, "of him are ye in Christ Jesus". Now what is the effect of all that on our hearts? I take the case of a poor man in a cottage and a rich man in his mansion. All the wants of the poor man are supplied by him, whatever necessity arises, he causes it to be met. But the poor man lives in his cottage and the rich man in his mansion. There is a great difference, however the grace may come, but if I have all the grace "in Christ", it shows I must be near
{371}
Him. You must know that it is not merely that you have to send a prayer up to the throne of grace, so as to bring a favour down, but, beloved friends, by the Holy Spirit of God you know that God has made the saints down here the testimony of Christ.
Then in verse 5, "that in everything ye have been enriched in him" -- it is all "in him". The church is a company of saints that is enriched "in him, in all word of doctrine, and all knowledge", that is the great privilege of the assembly of God. The great thing for us is to understand what our privilege is and that the Spirit of God is here that we may enter into all the unsearchable riches of Christ, and that the coming day may be near to us, not as a matter of time, but that we love His appearing.
Another thing that is connected with the church is that we should be held together in unity. I refer to what the Lord said in @John 17, "that they may be all one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us", the unity of divine love, the Father loving the Son and the Son loving the Father. Now if we are kept in the sense of that, we are taken so clean off the ground of responsibility and brought so on to the ground of privilege, that everything might be according to what is in Christ Jesus -- we should be brought into that. Now that is what the Lord prays for all who are now on the ground of responsibility.
What a wonderful thing unity is, unity of saints is the great testimony that we are free from man and free from the world. Oh! how wonderful the privilege we are brought into, how dim all this was to those Corinthians, how little they entered into it, so the apostle brings in the cross. If I look at the cross what do I see? That all I am and was, God hung it up to shame on the cross of Christ, so that I know that I cannot boast in anything of mine but only in my shame -- "their glory in their shame". God has hung it all up to shame that there should be no glorying in man or anything of the
{372}
flesh at all. But does He leave me there? Oh! no, He makes Christ everything to me, "But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who has been made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and holiness, and redemption". God's grace has worked in our hearts, and what a wonderful thing He introduces us into -- all that is of divine wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, redemption: righteousness, there I get the robe that fits me for everything; sanctification, separation from all that is unholy -- the more one's heart is true to Christ, the more we are drawn from the world; and finally redemption, which brings us into the scene where the Lord Jesus is everything.
Well, I have sought to bring before you the question of privilege, in order that we might be brought to know the way in which God works and may all our souls know it better for His name's sake.
{373}
THE SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS
@Genesis 3: 22 - 24; @Malachi 4: 1 - 3
I have just read these two passages, not exactly to attempt to expound them, but more for the sake of the contrast which they present. You see it is the contrast of two men: that of the man driven out, and the Sun of righteousness arising with healing in His wings. The contrast between the two is what I want to speak a little of tonight, and to try to shew you that the Sun of righteousness has come into view for us, and how we stand in relation to Him. I think it is a point of great moment to seize the idea of the Sun of righteousness. We have often read the verse in the prophecy, but I am not sure whether we have apprehended the force and bearing of it. That is the great point with regard to scripture; not simply to dwell on statements of scripture, but to know the import of those statements. Taking scripture up in a dogmatic way is not the best way. Many rest on statements of scripture, but we want to know the why and the how of all that scripture sets forth, and that is what the Spirit of God reveals. For instance, if you take the very simple expression we get here, "the Sun of righteousness", what is the import of "the Sun of righteousness"? Have you studied that? I want to bring it before you in contrast to what I read in the beginning of Genesis. It has often been said, that in Genesis we get all the roots, and in Revelation the full blown fruit. Genesis is the beginning, and you get the ultimate close of things in the Revelation. Scripture is one connected whole, shewing how God works out His way, and what the end of that way is. Scripture is not the invention of man. I do not think men would ever have agreed to traverse all that ground. Scripture was not written contemporaneously. It was written at different times and by different people; but it is one
{374}
complete whole. Genesis gives the beginning of things, and the working out of God's way is brought before us until you come to the final issue in the Revelation. You get the complete disentanglement of good and evil, so that each, in final result, finds its own place. You have presented to you in the Revelation on the one hand the lake of fire, and on the other hand the new heaven and the new earth. I take the meaning of that to be that God is pleased to bring before us the ultimate result, and to shew us that evil and good in ultimate result each find their own place. Evil finds its place with the source of evil in the lake of fire, and all good finds its place with God; and that is the new heaven and the new earth. Now, if we go back to Genesis, what we find is, that the man is driven out of paradise. He was no longer to be in the place which God frequented. The garden of Eden was where the tree of life was, it was the place which God frequented, and from that place God drove out the man. That man's sun set in darkness. It is a remarkable fact, but you scarcely get any further mention of that man -- of Adam. You read that he begat a son in his own likeness, and another son, and that he died. But as to the history of that man, we have none. That man is looked at in scripture as the man by whom sin came into the world, and death by sin, and the effect of this is he went into distance and darkness and death as the result of sin. He came under the power of death. That is what came to pass in Adam as the result of sin. Man had rebelled against God, had disobeyed Him, and had become alienated in heart from God, and God drove him out -- his sun set in darkness. That is the fact in regard to man whatever appearance man may get in the world. With all man's boasting, where is the man who evades death? Whatever advances men may make in the world in the way of discovery, man has not found any way to evade death. "By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin". Neither can men find God. Indeed they are content to be without God, and they
{375}
are becoming increasingly so, because they know if God comes in they will be rebuked. I believe that is why people hate scripture, because God rebukes them in it. God will not condone sin, pride, lust: if God comes in all that is rebuked, therefore men are content to be without God. But they cannot evade death. Man cannot relieve himself of the consequence of sin; he suffers many an ill in this world (disguise it as he may), and the course of man down here terminates in death, and that inevitably. In that respect the most intelligent, the most cultured and refined man really does not differ from the savage: "One thing befalleth them" -- death. Death is the common end of savage and civilised. The sun of man set in darkness because he rebelled against God; he practically lost God and went into death and darkness.
Now, in contrast, we get in the end of Malachi, "But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings". The figure employed is an extremely beautiful one, "the Sun of righteousness". I have no doubt that like every other prophecy, its literal application refers to the kingdom in the future; I do not think in strict application it refers to the present moment, but to Israel. "Ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall. And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the Lord, of hosts".
That no doubt applies actually to Israel in the coming of the Sun above the horizon; that I may come to presently, as God may help me, but the Sun of righteousness is hidden now; He has not yet arisen above the horizon of man's vision. The sun in natural things is there in the early morning, but you do not see it until it is above the horizon; it is there all night long, but you do not see it in the night because the sun is set. It is gone below the horizon of man's vision. But the sun is there. When the morning comes you first see the morning star before the sun rises with healing in his
{376}
wings. We find in natural things that people are sickly and weak unless they have plenty of the light and warmth of the sun; health does not flourish where people do not get the beneficial effects of the sun. Delicate people go to climes and parts of the world where they can have the benefit of the sun's light and warmth. Well, we read here that the Sun of righteousness arises with healing in His wings. Now, there can be no question that the allusion is to Christ, and to the truth of the character in which Christ will arise in the time to come. I was saying at the beginning that man's sun has set in death and darkness, but I come a little closer; here, Israel's sun had set in darkness and death. They were in captivity. God had allowed them to be scattered and brought into captivity to the gentiles. Jerusalem was in bondage to gentile power and the sun of Israel had set in darkness. It was a dark moment for the Jews in Malachi's day; it was some four or five hundred years before Christ came; and they got no more prophetic word after this. The prophetic word was the light of the people so long as it continued; but it ceased. Israel was to be a light in the world, but here the light of Israel had set in darkness and death.
Now you get a contrast to this in the promise: "But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings". That is what I dwell upon for a moment, it is so extremely important as it throws light on the coming day. That is what will come to pass; the Sun of righteousness will arise with healing in His wings in regard to this world; and this world in a kind of way will be healed; you get the thought in @John 1: 29, "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world"; He baptizes with the Holy Spirit; He gives life to the world; He came to save the world. That will be fulfilled when the Sun of righteousness arises with healing in His wings, and everything will then be revived for God. Everything that God ever set up upon the earth will be revived for
{377}
God. Israel will be revived, the nations will be revived; everything will be revived for God in that day when the Sun of righteousness arises with healing in His wings.
My point now is, as God may help me, to give you an idea of the Sun of righteousness, and to attempt to bring before you, if I can, that for us, that is for faith, the Sun of righteousness is already there; and I go a point further, that we, as believers, stand in relation to the Sun of righteousness. Now I will tell you what I understand by the Sun of righteousness; I understand the Sun of righteousness to be the Head and centre of the universe of bliss,
<blockquote>"Of the vast universe of bliss, <br>The centre Thou and Sun".</blockquote>
We have often sung these verses and I think they are very just.
Every one knows that the sun in nature is the centre and I might say the head of the physical universe; so is Christ to the universe of bliss. Christ is the Sun of righteousness. Christ has appeared. When the prophet Malachi wrote Christ had not appeared, they had to wait hundreds of years for the appearing of Christ. But for us the Sun of righteousness *has* come upon the scene. It is not simply that Christ was personally the righteous One; He was that. But it is this, that in Christ shines out all the righteousness and the love of God. He was the righteous One as Man down here. In Him God was glorified. Christ is spoken of repeatedly as the righteous One. Peter charged home upon the Jews that they had crucified the righteous One. But that is not all. He is the Sun of righteousness in whom the righteousness and love of God shine out. There are two things which we owe to the sun -- light and warmth. In Christ you get the righteousness and love of God, that is, light and warmth shine out in Him. That is what has come to light in Him. All has come to light in Him. All is declared; God is declared -- "No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom
{378}
of the Father, he hath declared him". God is declared in righteousness, and God is declared in love in the death of Christ. Christ could not be holden of death. He has been raised again from amongst the dead, and in Him we get all the light of the righteousness and love of God. He is the Sun of righteousness who rises with healing in His wings, and the righteousness and love of God in their bearing towards man are declared in Him. There would have been no object in the declaration of God, in the revelation of Himself, except in relation to men. But God has come out in relation to man, and has declared Himself to man in Christ. God has shone out in righteousness and love. God loved man, and because He loved man God has brought in righteousness for man. He has declared Himself in righteousness to man, and He has provided righteousness for man in Christ. In the work of redemption in which righteousness was provided for man, God shone out, and two things came to pass: redemption was accomplished and righteousness was provided for man. But in that same death of Christ God is declared in righteousness and love. Christ has risen and He is the Sun of righteousness in relation to the universe of bliss. But all that I am speaking of had no need to come to pass had not sin come into the world. He came in consequence of the fall. Man fell and the whole system fell with him. All fell with Adam. We see it all around us. Sin is around us and death by sin. You may attempt to attribute it to other causes, but the fact is there whatever the cause may be. The most clever man can give no cause for it. The only account is the divine account. "By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned". Adam fell and all fell with him. But now the great point for us is, that the Sun of righteousness has come upon the scene. And He is the Sun of righteousness in regard to man. God has been pleased to declare Himself in Christ -- the Sun of righteousness. Not only was righteousness provided for man (that
{379}
man might be covered in the presence of God), but God Himself was declared in righteousness and in love.
I now turn your attention to two or three passages in the New Testament. "The people which sat in darkness saw great light". @Matthew 4: 16. "That ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light". @1 Peter 2: 9. "The darkness is passing" (not is past) "and the true light already shines". @1 John 2: 8. Now I just want to touch on these passages for a moment. The moment Christ came a great light sprang up. Israel had been, indeed was, in darkness. The glory of God had departed from the temple. Ichabod was practically written on the people. The prophetic word had ceased, it had died out from them; there was no longer prophetic word or vision. The people were in that strait in Malachi's time. Then, in the advent of Christ, in due time a great light sprang up. @Matthew 4. He was the great luminary -- the Sun of righteousness had come upon the scene. The light had not yet *come out* in Him, but the great light was *there*. I pass on to @1 Peter 2: 9. There the apostle is speaking to the Jews, and what he could say to them was this, "But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light". What was His marvellous light? The Sun of righteousness. God had called the Jew out of the darkness in which the Jew was. The Jew had lapsed into darkness as dense as the darkness of the gentile, in spite of all that he claimed to have -- the oracles of God, &c. But God had called them out of darkness into His light. In Christ the light shone. God had come out in Christ, God was declared in love and righteousness in regard to man. On the other hand, righteousness was provided for man. Man could be justified by the grace of God, and so could come into the light. The Jew could enjoy the revelation of God made in Christ, because in connection with it there was
{380}
the announcement of God's grace to him. It would be entirely impossible for man to enjoy the revelation of God in love and righteousness without that man being at the same time made conscious of the grace of God by which he was justified in the eyes of God. Both things come out in divine perfection: righteousness for man so that man can be justified in the eyes of God, and God declared in love so that man can come into the light. God has been pleased to shine out and has called us out of darkness into His marvellous light, so that our joy and enjoyment and our life may be in the light of God's revelation in Christ. Now look at @1 John 2: 8. This is confirmatory. In Christ and in christians the darkness is passing (not "is past", that is going a little too far). "The true light now shineth". Mark this -- you have the Sun of righteousness, and for faith the Sun now shines. I could not say He has arisen above the horizon of this world's view, and He has not yet arisen to Israel. But the true light now shines -- His marvellous light -- and as I said before, it is not simply the fact but the import of the fact. The object and point is that man's soul may live in all the light of God's blessed revelation of Himself. I am convinced of this, it is the only place where man can find happiness and blessing. I do not care what men of the world may set up to have found, it is not possible for man to find real happiness except in the revelation of God. Supposing a man may find out anything, may make the most tremendous advances in science and in the discovery and application of natural laws, yet he gets to no kind of certainty, and there can be no certainty outside revelation, and there is no real guarantee for happiness apart from revelation. God is declared in Christ, and man can be (I know it) supremely content in the light of the revelation of God. Not only has God provided righteousness for man, that man may be justified from everything in His eye, but also that man may enjoy the revelation and declaration of Himself which God has been pleased to give in the great
{381}
light that now shines, and that in that light we may live. If any one asked me where I live as a christian, I should say, I do not live on earth as a christian and I do not live in heaven. But I will tell you where I live. I live in the light of God's love and righteousness in Christ. I cannot find the light in the common things of this life. I have to take up the common things but I do not find the light there. I find the light of God in my own soul, "his marvellous light", the declaration of Himself in Christ. In the physical universe everything is maintained in relation to the sun, every planet, &c. It is not simply that every planet stands in relation to the sun, but there are certain physical laws by which every planet is held in relation to the sun. There is exactly the same principle in regard to the universe of bliss, that is, that universe of which Christ is the centre and the sun. We come into relation to the Sun by faith. It is in the faith of Christ that we come into relation with Him. But then also provision is made in order to maintain us in relation to Him. He communicates to the believer living water. "Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life". @John 4: 13, 14. Christ is presented, the great Light is presented to man as the Object of faith. In Him is expressed the grace of God. But it is that man may believe in Him; that they may come into relation to the Sun of righteousness and the universe of bliss. The Sun of righteousness communicates of His Spirit that men may be maintained in relation to Him, and may not be moved away from Him.
I know of no existing power that could detach the earth from its relation to the sun, or the moon from its relation to this earth. All are held by the influence of natural laws. So, in regard to the Sun of righteousness, He imparts to the believer living water that the believer may be maintained in relation to Him, so that he is
{382}
righteous even as Christ is righteous. That is a wonderful thing. The essence and power of christianity is that Christ imparts living water in order that we may be maintained in relation to Him. The meaning and force of living water is twofold. One is, it assures our hearts of the love of God, it contents us, we are so satisfied with the love of God that the living water springs up in the believer in response to that love; and so your heart is maintained in the consciousness of the love of God, your heart responds to it and you are maintained in relation to the One who so loves you. The Sun of righteousness is the One in whom that love is revealed, and the living water maintains the believer in relation to Him and his heart is kept in content. You have nothing to desire. Nothing but the knowledge of God's love will ever keep the heart of man in content, so that a man can say -- I have nothing to wish for; I have got the greatest thing in the universe; and not only do I know the love of God, but love to God springs up in my heart.
Another fact consequent on the reception of the Spirit is, that you move in the orbit in which God has been pleased to set you. He has set you and me and every believer in relation to the Sun of righteousness, and it is the Spirit that maintains us in relation to that Sun. Christ Himself as Man here in humiliation was the righteous One and moved in the divinely appointed orbit. My path as a christian is to walk as Christ walked; I am not only kept by the Spirit of life, but I move in the divinely appointed orbit, that is, the path of God's will. The Spirit is life because of righteousness. I will tell you what marks a christian: he is in the path of God's will. And what is the path of God's will? It is practical righteousness. I stand in relation to Christ. He is my righteousness in the eye of God, and I am kept in the orbit God has appointed me to. It means fidelity in every relationship in which God has been pleased to set me. Fidelity in my relationship to God -- to Christ -- and to those who are in Christ. Righteousness is really fulfilled
{383}
in love. Love is the fulfilment of the law. I carry out practical righteousness because I am in relation to the Sun of righteousness. I do not think there is any one I love so well as God; and I love Christ in whom God is revealed. If I love God, I love Christ, and then if I love Christ, I love those who are Christ's. Love goes all round. And I am formed down here by the Spirit of love, and I am maintained in practical righteousness; I walk and am maintained down here in the orbit in which God has placed me. Now all that I have been speaking of is christianity in its very first principles; I have not spoken of anything profound. The Sun of righteousness has arisen for *us*. We are brought into His marvellous light, into the light of God's declaration of Himself in Christ. For us, therefore, the darkness is passing and the true light now shineth. It is perfectly deplorable to me to see christians striving to attach christianity to a path and place in this world. That is not according to God. You want to be in the light of God's world. There is a world which God has before Him of which Christ is the centre and the sun. All will come into light very shortly. The Sun of righteousness will arise with healing in his wings. But then the Sun *has* come into presence, and we are brought into relationship to the Sun, and we are established and maintained in relation to the Sun. And the practical outcome of it is this, that righteousness is fulfilled in us, the righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled in those who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit. There must be no turning back; there must be separation from the world which has sprung from Adam. You can never set that man up again. God intended to abolish that man in the death of Christ in order that He might communicate to man His Spirit. That man was brought to an end in the death of Christ, so that God might impart the Spirit of another Man to the one who believes in Christ. We have been brought by faith through grace to believe in Christ. He has given to
{384}
us His Spirit that we may be maintained in relation to Him who is the Sun of righteousness, that righteousness may be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit. "If Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness". I speak of these things because I desire that ministry should have the proper effect of setting the people of God free from the entanglements of this world. I am convinced that you never will enjoy deliverance except as your soul lives in the light of God's world, and I ask any reasonable person, 'Is not God's world far better than man's world?' Man's world is a system in which man has glory, and in which man seeks glory. But I will tell you the principles that rule in man's world, principles which were declared hundreds of years ago, but which are exactly the same today: the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the pride of life. The great principles that rule in God's world, of which Christ is the centre and sun, are love and righteousness. Everything there is pervaded by divine love, and has its spring in divine love, and there too is the great principle of righteousness, that is, that in every direction fidelity is maintained in every divinely appointed relationship. I ask any thoughtful person whether that is ever to be brought to pass in *this* world? Is man going to give up lust and pride? He might as well give up himself. Is not God's world better than that, where everything is pervaded by divine love, where all is maintained in divine righteousness? That is what will come to pass in God's world. It will come to pass even in Israel's history; the very nations upon earth will be affected by it. Israel will cry in that day, "God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to shine upon us; Selah. That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations".
Is not that better than anything man can produce? That is God's world, of which Christ is the centre and sun, and now we are maintained in the light of it by His Spirit, that we may be here to walk in the orbit which God
{385}
has been pleased to appoint for us in relation to the Sun of righteousness.
May God give us to understand these very simple principles much more distinctly.
{386}
THE KINGDOM OF OUR LORD AND SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST
@2 Peter 1: 1 - 21; @Revelation 22: 16
It is important to notice one feature which marks the so-called catholic epistles; that is, those which are not addressed to any particular church, such as this epistle and the first epistles of Peter and John. It has been pointed out that all these contemplate the last time. Even the epistles written to individuals have that character, for instance, Paul's epistles to Timothy and Titus. They refer to the last days. They all contemplate the decay of christianity as a witness here. This is very much brought out in this epistle, and the same principle comes out in the writings of John. John speaks of the last time. "Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time". There were many antichrists in the days of John and there are plenty of them in our time. John does not look forward to the last time, because in fact it had set in before the apostles passed off the scene. It is a very important point to bear this in mind. The time had not yet come for the revelation of antichrist himself, but there were many antichrists in that day; and I do not think we can doubt there are many antichrists in this day. In the first epistle of Peter it says, "the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God", because the house of God did not answer entirely to the mind of God. It was not the idea of the house of God at the outset that judgment should begin there. When we get the house of God in the early days of the apostles when they "had all things common" you would not connect the judgment of God with that; but even in Peter's time (and Peter could go back to the day of Pentecost) he has to say, "the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God".
{387}
And in this second epistle it is much more advanced; you have only to read this second epistle and you will see a very dark picture drawn of what had come to pass, the introduction of damnable heresies that men would bring in, and that in that way christianity as a system on earth would be vitiated. That is what comes out in chapter 2 of this second epistle. When that comes to be the case you may depend upon it one thing is certain to happen, the kingdom will come into view. The same principle comes out in the Revelation. After the addresses to the seven churches, then you get judgment, and the introduction of the kingdom. There is nothing left but for God to come in, in the kingdom, when the church has failed as witness. This is exactly what we get in this second epistle of Peter. The apostle brings into view the kingdom, but in the second chapter he shows us the effect of these damnable heresies coming into the profession of christianity. He shews us the starting point of departure and the course the departure would take; it is all marked out in a striking way in chapter 2. These things to a certain extent are spoken of prophetically, though the germs of it were working in the apostles day. Every apostle speaks of the decay and ruin of christianity as a system down here. Paul spoke of "grievous wolves" and "perverse men". John speaks of "many antichrists". Peter speaks of "false prophets". And one striking feature in regard to all is this, none of them held out any prospect whatever of recovery. Once decay set into the church accompanied by mischief and deceit, there is no prospect of recovery. God would come in and sustain faith and the faithful, but looking at the thing generally there was no hope of recovery. I see the great importance of saints being in the light of the future. We want to be very much in the light of the future. That principle comes out very distinctly here, and that is my reason for taking up this chapter. If we are in the light of what is to come, it has a reflex effect. We become light in a way; it is the day dawning and the day star arising in our hearts.
{388}
And that is a very important point with regard to christians down here; the place of the church as a kind of connecting link between Christ and the future is not always seen. Yet it is so in the ways of God. Beyond all doubt the beginning of God's ways is Christ, and in a sense one may speak of the church, the body of Christ, as the continuation of Christ. Christ is no longer here personally, but His body is here, He lives in it, therefore Christ is here.
In @Colossians 1: 27 you get, "Christ in you, the hope of glory". Christ was in them; and if Christ is in the saints the hope of glory, then Christ in the saints becomes the connecting link with the past and the future. Evidently the church is the connecting link with the past because it is the body of Christ and it is the connecting link with the future because it is "Christ in you, the hope of glory". The church is a kind of continuation of what had its beginning in Christ. Christ was the point of departure for God. He is the last Adam, the second Man, the Sun of righteousness: all that was true of Christ when He became Man. He was the beginning. We ought always to read the gospels in that light. He is "the first-born among many brethren". It was not simply that He was the first-born in resurrection. He is the first-born from among the dead. All that is true. But He was the beginning in the very fact of His incarnation. You see that in a very marked way in the gospel of John. Christ is the beginning, the point of departure for God. The continuation of Christ is the church. Christ is in His body, and Christ in the body is the hope of glory. Glory means, I suppose, the effulgence of God when God sees fit to shine out through the veil of providence in all that He is. @The apostle in @2 Corinthians 4 speaks thus, "God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ". All that comes out in the gospel, the glory of Christ, and the knowledge of
{389}
the glory of God. All has to come out in a public and manifest way and will come out in the kingdom.
That is most important in regard to us, and that would I judge have a great effect upon us. The effect would be that our souls would be in the light of that which is coming, and then we should be light here in the world. The apostle speaks from verse 3 as follows, "According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.... For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.... For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty". I want to speak about three things here mentioned. First, the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ; secondly, the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and thirdly, the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. These are three thoughts in this second epistle of Peter peculiar to the moment. He speaks of abundant entrance into the kingdom, and then he speaks of the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and refers to the scene which took place on the mount of transfiguration, which had the effect of confirming the prophetic word. The prophetic word up to a certain point was useful to saints "until
{390}
the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts".
I would like to lead you on to that point. In order to be here for God and to be here in the way of witness we want the day to dawn and the day star to arise in our hearts. It cannot arise elsewhere. The only place where the day could dawn is in the hearts of believers. It is the anticipating of the Sun of righteousness arising with healing in His wings. If we are not conscious of being in relation to the Sun of righteousness this will not be fulfilled in us. But it is the divine mind that it should be fulfilled in us by the day star arising in our hearts. All is dependent on the thought of the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. The apostle marks out a path by which saints practically reach God. "In your faith have also virtue", &c. It indicates a sort of progress, a sort of road. It gives the landmarks in a path by which we practically reach God. You see the purpose of the gospel: "Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God". I have no doubt that will be completely fulfilled when we are brought to God's own habitation. I do not think anything short of that can fulfil the divine purpose for which Christ died. That is, He will bring us to God where God is. But what I see in the meantime is this, that there is a way by which we come to God *now*. We come to God at the present time as being in accord with the mind of God. No one could be said to have come to God if he were not in accord with the nature of God. If a man does not love God, you could not say that man had come to God, for God is love. If you come to Him you must be according to His nature. People may take it up in a kind of dogmatic way that Christ has brought us to God. But as a matter of fact scripture does not speak so. Christ suffered, the Just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God. *How* we are brought to God is another matter. The thought of it is, I have no doubt, true in the case of the children of Israel when God brought them out of Egypt into the wilderness. "Thou
{391}
in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed;" but then it goes further, "Thou shalt bring them *in*". The great idea of God for His people is to bring them to the abode of God. Christ will bring us to God where God is in the Father's house. "Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am;" that is the full idea of being brought to God. But in the meantime there is a way in which we are brought to God at the present time morally, and that is, we are being practically conformed to God's nature. Therefore, the apostle here shews the road to it -- faith is the first thing -- it is that with which everyone commences, "In your faith have also virtue". You want a measure of courage to be able to stand down here to what you believe. Faith would not be of much value if you were not prepared to stand to what you believe, so you want to have in your faith courage. Then you want *knowledge*, which is an extremely important point, because none of us begins with very much knowledge. Then there is the danger of knowledge puffing up, therefore we want temperance in knowledge. Then patience which brings us very much in accord with God, because patience is characteristic of God, and when we come to patience we are in accord with God. Then other things come in, piety and brotherly love, and then you come to *love*. Christians are tested really by the brethren. A man proves that he loves God by love to the brethren. The brethren are practically the test. John puts it in that way, "If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom be hath not seen?" We are tested by the children of God. Brotherly love comes in and love follows upon brotherly love. Then I say you are in accord with the divine nature, because the point is that we may be partakers of the divine nature. We must all travel that road. A soul travels a certain road that brings him morally to God, and he realises that he *is* brought
{392}
to God. He is not brought to God in heaven, he is brought to God morally, he is in accord with the nature of God. He loves God. Great and precious promises are given to us, promises which open up the whole extent of divine purposes in Christ: "whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust". I have said sometimes if I were to be asked where I live *as a christian* I should find it in a way difficult to make myself understood in reply, for I do not live actually in heaven and I do not live on earth as a christian. I live on earth as a matter of fact, I am a pilgrim and a stranger on it, but if I speak of myself abstractly as a christian I will tell you where I live -- I live in the love of God. A christian *will* live in heaven, it is his home, but in the meantime he is brought to God in the fact of being in accord with the divine nature, see @Ephesians 1: 4, "According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love". We are brought to God to be with Him and before Him according to His nature, and the result will be that we shall be with God in His own habitation. Now what the apostle puts before us here is that we are set *on that way*. It is a great thing for the christian to be conscious that he has escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. The world is filled with corruption through lust, but here we read, "According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust". God and the world are in complete antagonism, the principle of the world is lust, and the nature of God is love. Those two things you can never mix, love and lust; and
{393}
if I am a partaker of the divine nature, then I have escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. If I have reached love, then I have escaped lust. It is absolutely impossible for the two things to go together. And practically if you find a man walking in the principles of this world and governed by the principles of this world, which are lust and pride, it cannot be true of that man that he is practically brought to God. It is an entire contradiction. On the other hand, if we are made partakers of the divine nature, if we know God's love and love God, then we realise that we have escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust, "so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ".
Now just a word about the kingdom. I think a great point is that what will rule in that kingdom is that which is of God. I think the thought of the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ is that there is a complete putting down of all that is hostile to God. The Lord Jesus Christ is vested with power and authority to destroy all that is hostile to God. Not exactly to destroy it in effect but to destroy its power, and that is what will mark the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ: all evil will be annulled, whether the power of Satan, sin, or antichrist. Every power that is hostile to God will be annulled in the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ. But, on the other hand, what will rule in that kingdom will be of God, just as what rules in the world now is of Satan. Satan is the god and prince of this world, and what rules really in the world now is of Satan. Murder and lying and lust and all that kind of thing rules in the world. There is plenty of murder in the world. I do not mean murder in the common meaning of the term, but men are prepared to take away the life of their fellows, not by mere violence, but man is prepared to pursue his own advantage at the expense of his fellow man, and that is the principle of murder. Then as to lying, the world is
{394}
to an immense extent a great lie. It is based on a maintenance of appearance. Things are not what they seem to be in the world; every one must admit that things are not what they appear to be. Society would not go on at all if everything appeared as it really is. The maintenance of society depends on things not being what they appear to be. Society is built up on appearance and underneath there may be anything so long as appearance is maintained. The principle of lust and pride is all around us; not simply in the immoral, but the moral justify ambition, pride, lust, and all that kind of thing, for the great principle in all is self-gratification. Lust and pride are expressions of self-gratification and self-satisfaction. How different to all that is of God! You see the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ brings in all that is of God. Christ -- the Sun of righteousness brings the light and revelation of what God is, and what He brings is the love and righteousness of God; and that gives its character to the kingdom. The kingdom will really take its character from the revelation of God, that is, the light of God which will prevail and which will rule in the kingdom.
"For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ". I think we want to come into the intelligence of that kingdom at the present time, into the understanding of it. It is that which is ministered to us at the present time, the understanding of the principle, and power, and character of that kingdom. You must remember it is the kingdom of God. Dispensationally it is the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, but morally it is the kingdom of God, because all that shines out is of God; love and righteousness rule in the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. On the other hand there is power and authority, for everything obnoxious or hostile to God will be annulled -- Satan, antichrist, the sin of the world taken away, the whole world system broken to pieces, idolatry, love
{395}
of money, and all the principles that rule this world, will be annulled in that day. What will prevail then will be the love and righteousness of God, and that love and righteousness will shine out in the Sun of righteousness; that is the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. And it is extremely important that we should seek in some measure to understand the moral character of that kingdom, and its contrast to all that prevails in the world at the present time. It is the kingdom of Satan now. God has delivered us -- christians, out of the authority of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of the Son of His love. The world is morally the kingdom of Satan, and the principles which govern and actuate men are principles which have their rise in Satan. I quite admit there are traces of God; you get natural affection, mercy, &c.; things in the world are very much improved by the light of christianity, but if you look beneath the surface you will find that all is very different to what I have brought before you, and that it is the strongest possible contrast to what rules in the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
Next we read, "Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth. Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance; knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me. Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance". Now it is a point of interest here that the Lord had shewed to the apostle that he must put off his tabernacle. The great idea in christianity is that you are waiting for the Lord. The parable of the kingdom of heaven shows that the ten virgins went forth to meet the bridegroom; they do not go forth to die or in anticipation of death. Scripture sanctions the idea of saints being here in expectation of the coming of the Lord. It is the proper attitude of
{396}
christians. The wicked servant says in his heart, "My lord delayeth his coming". The saints, too, they become worldly; but the proper attitude is waiting for Him. If you look at things according to God there is no slackness in the fulfilment of His promise. There may be delay in relation to man, but there is no delay according to God. With God it is not lapse of time, but a question of things being morally ripe. You never find God interfering until things are ripe; the nations were not expelled from Canaan in order for Israel to take possession before things were ripe. Things must be morally ripe for God to interfere. As far as christians are concerned we are converted to wait for the coming of the Lord, and that expectation is specially encouraged in the epistles to the Thessalonians. "For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord".
The expectation is not rebuked or checked by Paul, he says "we which are alive and remain". So too he speaks about a crown of righteousness being given him and unto all them also that love His appearing. That is the attitude of the christian -- loving His appearing, and "looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ". Peter knew that he was to pass away, that he was to put off his tabernacle. The Lord had shewn him that he was to prove his fidelity to Him by martyrdom, but He had also shewn him that there were those who would be here until the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. And, therefore, Peter writes to them in that way to confirm them; he would put them in remembrance;
{397}
he had been an eyewitness of the majesty of the Lord, and why do you think he would not be negligent to put them always in remembrance of these things? I do not think it was simply to confirm them in the faith of it, but that they might be in expectation of it and be coloured by it. If we have affection for the power and coming of our Lord it does tend to colour us down here. If christians had this affection in their hearts it could not fail to colour them in their ways and conduct. I do not think they would be going in for position in this world if they had the conviction of the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. And that is what Peter sought to bring home to them -- His power and coming; he says, I am going to pass off the scene, but others will be here until the coming of the Lord, and he would bring home to them the conviction of the certainty of the power and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and therefore to that end he refers to the scene of transfiguration. It is rather remarkable that the account of the transfiguration is not given in the gospels by any one who was there. It is given to us by Matthew, Mark and Luke, but none of them was present at it, and John, who *was* present, does not recount it. Peter refers to it here, but only incidentally, and with the object of giving conviction as to the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. I was saying at the beginning that Christ was the point of departure for God and we get Him owned from heaven two or three times. At His baptism and on the mount of transfiguration God His Father owns Him, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased". What is so important is this, that it is in connection with the kingdom; Christ becomes the connecting link between the kingdom and the Father. You see the source of the kingdom is the Father. It is the Father's kingdom, and the connecting link is God's beloved Son. And its relation to the Father and Son is what will give colour to the kingdom. The kingdom will take its character from the One who is the source of the kingdom, and the
{398}
character of God, the nature of God comes out in His beloved Son. The character of Queen Victoria has had a great effect on this country from a moral point of view. If you have a highly immoral king it would affect the whole country, and also on the other hand the country would be affected by a king or queen in whom there is a high standard of morality. What then must be the effect of the Father's King, and when all the mind of the Father comes out in the beloved Son. That is what will give character to the kingdom when the kingdom is set up. The source of the kingdom is the Father and it is the Father and the Son who will give character to the kingdom in that day, and I think that came out on the mount of transfiguration when the Lord received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to Him from the excellent glory, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased". And what was "honour and glory"? It was the Father's salutation. The Father saluted Him, that was honour and glory. Do you think when the kingdom is set up Christ will want any glory from man? His greatest glory is the Father's salutation, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased". I have not a doubt that the relation between the Father and Son (He is the Son of the Father's love) is what will give character to the kingdom when the time comes for the setting forth of the King. All that is connected with the "power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ". That is what Peter refers to. In the "power and coming" Christ comes to establish what is suitable to God in the way in which God is revealed. The veil of providence which tends to hide God at the present time will then be completely set aside. All that is in God, righteousness and love, will shine forth in the Sun of righteousness in that day, and there will be the absolute putting down of what is obnoxious to God. All this was the confirmation of prophecy, so Peter says, You do well to give heed to prophecy to a certain point, "as unto a light that shineth
{399}
in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts". It is of all moment that christians should be here in the light of the coming day, and it is a great point too that as we get near the end the Spirit and the bride say, Come. The Lord reveals what is of God. In @Revelation 22: 16, 17, you get the "morning star". Here (@2 Peter 1: 19) you get "the day star". Where now is the day star, the morning star, if not in christians? I cannot conceive where they can be found if it is not in the hearts of christians. Thus we are already in the light of the Sun of righteousness -- He has not yet arisen above the horizon of man's vision -- but we have the day star, the harbinger of day, in our hearts. We are not curious about prophecy, it is not an absorbing object. It has its proper place, but everything is now changed for the christian; the world is a dark place enough, but for the christian the day *has* dawned, the day star *has* arisen in his heart. The christian is already a reflection in a way of the Sun of righteousness, but this could not possibly be if we have not Christ before us in the revelation of all that God is. For in the revelation of God in Christ we learn the great and blessed principles which will rule in the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Now as we come near to the end all these things are extremely important. There is no hope of the restoration of the church. It never will be restored down here. It will have its own proper place in glory. It comes down from God out of heaven. It will be displayed then, having the glory of God. But in regard to us down here, a few here on earth, our proper witness is this -- the day has dawned, the day star has arisen. I cannot understand people who really take that ground being negligent of the truth of the church: that cannot possibly be. If the day star has arisen in your heart, what you seek to do until Christ comes is to maintain fidelity to Him. The effect of it is to be found here in the affection proper to the bride; Christ says, "I am the root and the offspring of David,
{400}
and the bright and morning star. And the Spirit and the bride say, Come". If the coming of the Lord had its own proper place in our hearts it would not make us slack in any sense in regard to the place of the church here. How is the Lord displayed when He comes? What is it through which His glory is set forth? He shall come to be glorified in His saints and to be admired in all them that believe. It is that which is according to Him, the object of His affections, in which the glory of the Bridegroom is set forth. That is the display of Christ, and we should be here now in the affection of the bride saying to Him, "Come".
Now I think these things are extremely important. If we want to be light here in the world we must be more completely separate from all the corrupt things that go on in the world, which all have their root in lust in some form. We must be apart from these and in accord with God in His nature, and "Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works". Remember *that* -- "that *he might redeem us from all iniquity*". The cry has gone forth. The Lord grant the Bridegroom may have His own proper place in the hearts of His own; it is not to be occupied with the details of prophecy but with the day star, the harbinger of the day, with the Sun of righteousness. If you are not under the influence of the Sun of righteousness you may depend upon it that the day star has not arisen in your heart. May God be pleased to grant that these things may be fulfilled in regard to those who have been brought to God according to His nature, that is love and righteousness. His is an eternal and enduring kingdom on account of the stability of the moral principles on which it is established. That is the reason of the endurance of that kingdom.

THE CHRIST DWELLING IN THE HEART
@Ephesians 3: 14 - 21
I suppose that many here tonight have been present on former occasions and have heard what has been taken up from time to time. But it may not have struck all that there was a kind of connection between the different subjects which have been before us. The fact is, I have endeavoured, by the grace of God, to start from the very simplest elements of truth and to lead up to what, in a kind of way, is the greatest thing that can be brought to pass down here. I think we get that presented to us in the prayer here. Nothing can exceed the object of the prayer, because the object is that we may be filled unto all the fulness of God; and that is in the way of testimony down here. The fulness of God indicates the precious features of God presented in the saints, that is, that there may be in the saints the expression of God according to the way in which God is spoken of in the prayer. It cannot go beyond that. The church could never be as great as God. Therefore all must be within certain limits. It is limited by the measure in which the blessed God has been pleased to reveal Himself. We know God as He has been pleased to reveal Himself. We cannot know Him beyond that revelation; otherwise it would be to make the creature as great as God. God is God, and the creature is the creature, and God's creature. And whatever the place of blessing into which the creature is brought by God, he can only know God within the limits of revelation. There are heights and depths in God which are only known to Himself. He dwelleth "in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen nor can see; to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen".
I will just touch for a moment what I have tried to bring under our attention previously. In the first lectures
{402}
my point was to show the relation into which we are brought in regard to the Sun of righteousness. I do believe it to be most important for us to recognise Christ officially. Not simply that we believe in His Person -- we believe that Jesus is Christ -- that He is the Son of God, but we want the apprehension of what Christ is officially. That is, the apprehension of Christ in the place which Christ has according to divine counsels. He is the beginning and the centre of the moral universe of bliss. That is the place which Christ has. It has been very often said that the world that is, was really built up on one man, all sprung out of one man. So in a sense the world to come has one Man as the foundation of it; it is built up on one Man, but then the world to come has a moral foundation, which is *righteousness*. That is not the case with the existing world. The present world was the handiwork of God; but the world to come is really based on redemption. It is all built up in connection with one Man -- the Christ. If I speak simply of Christ I generally mean Christ personally; if I say *the* Christ I speak of Christ officially in that which Christ is as the centre, the Object, the Beginning, the Head, of divine counsels -- the pivot on which all the world to come turns. We get an illustration of it in what I have referred to more than once in regard to the solar system. There are two things that mark that system. Every planet is held in relation to the sun, and at the same time it derives from the sun. Every planet moves in its appointed orbit in relation to the sun; by a certain law of nature it is held to the sun; but that is not all the truth, there is something more, every planet derives from the sun, and is dependent on the sun for light, and warmth, and all that tends to maintain and propagate life. The same principle is true, I do not doubt, in regard to the universe of bliss, that universe of which Christ is the centre. Every christian in that universe is held to Christ by a spiritual law, and at the same time he derives from Christ. So that nothing can be of more importance
{403}
to begin with than to understand how we are placed in relation to the Sun of righteousness; how we are established in righteousness as before God. We never had to accomplish righteousness, nor has the righteousness of God been declared in *us*, but in Christ. The righteousness of God is established in Christ, and at the same time Christ has accomplished righteousness in regard to us. Now by the Spirit of God we are established in righteousness. Christ is to us the beginning and the centre of the system of the universe of bliss, and we stand in relation to Him by the Spirit of Christ. We are established in righteousness in relation to Christ; the orbit in which the christian moves is in relation to the Sun of righteousness, and the christian is found walking down here even as Christ walked in the path of the divine will. If you do not walk in relation to Christ the will of God is not fulfilled in you. The perfection of God's will is fulfilled in Christ Himself. And the will of God is fulfilled in us in measure as we walk in relation to Christ down here. Just in the measure that Christ is pre-eminent in the heart of a christian, so he walks in the path of God's will down here. It is the principle of attraction really. One is held by the power of attraction to Christ Himself; just as a planet is held in relation to the sun, so the christian moves in the divinely appointed orbit. There is no other way of practical righteousness. "If Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness". Righteousness is a very simple thing; righteousness is doing right. Righteousness is really maintaining in fidelity every divinely appointed relationship. We have to understand the relation in which we stand to God and to Christ and to one another, and even the inferior relations down here, social relations. We have to understand where God has set us; then we move in the appointed orbit of the will of God. That is the practical result of a christian being in Christ.
Then our next point is another truth, which is Christ
{404}
*in us*, and there the character of Christ and the sensibilities of Christ all come out; all that is of Christ comes out in the christian circle down here, so that the christian circle is really the expression of Christ. It is His body. It is that in which Christ lives down here upon earth. It may seem a strange thing to say, but He lives down here in the saints. Personally He is at the right hand of God, but by the Spirit He lives in the saints down here. If anybody were to say to me, 'Give a definition of christianity?' I should reply, 'Christianity is Christ' -- Christ in the saints by the work of the Spirit; anything outside that is not christianity in the sight of God. Much that we see around which is called christianity is not christianity at all, it is spurious christianity. It is a christianity that had its birth in judaism and heathenism. Christianity in the true sense is Christ by the work of the Spirit in the saints down here, and if you read @Colossians 3 you will find in what a wonderful way the sensibilities and character and marks of Christ shine out in them. They were to put on love. The bond of saints is spiritual affections by the Spirit of Christ. Then the word of Christ was to dwell in them richly. The christian company or circle was to be characterised by what is of Christ because Christ is in them. The body of Christ is that in which Christ lives down here by the Spirit of God, and on the other hand it is that in which Christ is expressed down here. If we refer to the second epistle of Peter we see the striking fact of the decay of christianity, what was coming in, and what had come in: the complete failure of christianity as witness for God; but in contrast we get there too all that is vitally important to the christian -- the way we are practically brought to God. "Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God". But, are we brought to God? If we are brought to God we must be brought to Him according to His nature. The path to it is shewn by the apostle here. You begin with faith and you end with love. When
{405}
a man believes in Christ he receives the gift of the Holy Spirit and thus he is brought to God in a kind of way. But being brought to God practically is the work of the Spirit in us. In the divine mind we are brought to God "holy and without blame before him in love". It is the result of the effectual work of the Spirit of God in the believer. It is very much what is seen in the prodigal brought into the father's house in @Luke 15: be gets the best robe, the ring and the shoes, he is set at the father's table, and he is prepared to take part in the festivities. That is the true idea of man brought to God.
Then there is another point, and that is that in regard to the christian the day has dawned and the day star has arisen in his heart -- Christ is in his heart. The practical result of that is, that there is an air of brightness about the christian that you could not possibly find elsewhere. The day has dawned, the day star has arisen in the heart, the harbinger of the day giving brightness to the heart. It is impossible that the day star should have arisen in the heart without imparting to the heart a sense of brightness and hope in anticipation of the day. Thus it is that prophecy no longer has a special place to us, because prophecy had the peculiar character of "a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts". Prophecy cannot have the same place to us now as it had to the saints of old. It was to them as a light shining in a dark place. But now something else has come to pass, the day star -- Christ, has arisen in the heart of believers. You get something very nearly akin to it in the Revelation, "I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star". Then you get the response of the bride, "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come".
Now that may form a kind of introduction to what I want to say tonight. I want to go further to another feature which comes out in this prayer in @Ephesians 3. I am not going to attempt any kind of exposition of this prayer. What I want to do, if the Lord accord me the
{406}
help, is simply to suggest one or two thoughts that come out in a striking way in the prayer. I think we may all be helped in that way in the terms of the prayer. The first thing that strikes one in the prayer is the wonderful way you get divine Persons working in unity in order to bring about a certain result. The first thing to mark is that the persons who are in view as the subjects of divine interest and petition, are the saints. The apostle intercedes on behalf of the saints, but you get all the divine Persons, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, His Spirit -- the Spirit of the Father, and then the Christ; all are, so to speak, working together in connection with a certain result to be produced in saints. It is a very remarkable prayer in that way and it shews us the relative position of Each divine Person. I believe that is a great thing to get hold of. It greatly helps us. The passage connects the thought of divine counsels with the Father. "For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole (or every) family in heaven and earth is named", &c. Therefore I think it is plain enough that our minds may connect the thought of divine counsels with the Father. There are undoubtedly many families on earth and in heaven. I could not attempt to enumerate them, but in heaven there are at any rate the following: the church and the Old Testament saints, all of whom are portrayed in the twenty-four elders in the beginning of Revelation. Then there is a variety of families on earth; take the gathering out from nations, and the nations; and there may be other families which my mind has not taken in, but all families in heaven and on earth are named of the Father. The Father has determined that which is to be set forth in each family; there is one thing to be set forth in the church and another thing in Israel, and another in the fathers. Each family has its place in connection with the counsels of the Father.
The next point is that the agent in all that is the Spirit. "That he would grant you, according to the riches of
{407}
his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man". The Spirit of the Father is the agent by which everything is effectuated down here. We do not effectuate anything in regard to one another. I may try to enlighten you, but I do not think it is in my power to effectuate anything in you, or you in me; nothing is effectuated down here except by the Spirit of the Father. We may affect one another in a very evanescent manner. You may work on people's imagination and affect them in regard to intelligence, but not morally; all that is the work of the Spirit of the Father. The prayer is that they might be strengthened inwardly. The Spirit does not concern Himself with the outward man; He concerns Himself with what is inward, that is what the Spirit of the Father builds up. The Spirit of God is building up in the saints the inward man, which is renewed day by day, and it is in the inward man not in the outward man that we are strengthened. As we go along we get an increased sense of weakness in the outward man. Young people do not think much about it, they have health, strength and vigour, and do not concern themselves about the perishing of the outward man. But on the other hand there is the inward man, looked upon as the work of God, strengthened; the inner man is strengthened with might by His Spirit. It is a wonderful work and I thank God for the patience which He bestows upon His people, and for the work of His Spirit in His people. Now the object is that the Christ may dwell in your heart by faith. I will tell you what I understand by that. I think it indicates the place of the church here as the faithful bride; that is what is in view, and it is brought much before us throughout Ephesians. The prominent thought in Colossians is the body, while in Ephesians the prominent thought is the bride, and if you do not understand the bride you will not understand what it is for Christ to dwell in your heart by faith. It contemplates that the bride is left here where the Bridegroom is not. The Bridegroom is elsewhere, but
{408}
the bride is here, and as in Revelation she cries, "Come"; what marks the bride is that the Bridegroom is dwelling by faith in her heart. You can understand this illustration -- If a faithful wife were in England and if her husband were abroad, by necessity compelled to be at the other end of the earth, he would dwell by faith in her heart. She has not got him in person, but he is by faith dwelling in her heart, and I think that is our true position here upon earth. The church mourns the absence of the Bridegroom and she cries "Come" to the Bridegroom. But in the meantime He dwells in her heart by *faith*. "He that hath the bride is the bridegroom". The bridegroom is a very great thought in scripture. It is a figure constantly applied to Christ; the idea it conveys to me is that the Bridegroom is the One that comes to ally Himself with every interest of God down here upon earth. The Bridegroom has the bride, and that is that Christ came here in order that He might take up every interest of God down here on earth. All has been cut off in a way by the death of Christ. "Shall Messiah be cut off, and shall have nothing". The Bridegroom has gone to heaven; but the true bride is down here on earth; and the Bridegroom dwells in the heart of the bride by faith. There is one here upon earth who subordinates every interest of her own to the Bridegroom. I believe that is the idea of the church. I think saints properly have not an interest of their own to serve. Saints make too much of their families and business, and live as though they had a great many interests here to pursue. That is not the idea of the church; a faithful bride if her bridegroom were absent would have no interest to pursue or maintain except the interests of the absent bridegroom, and that is true of the bride here on earth if the Christ dwells in her heart by faith. The practical result is this, her heart is deeply interested in anything and everything which concerns the Bridegroom. That is the true place of the church down here. If I get any additional thought as to
{409}
the glory of the Son, of the Bridegroom, it is a supreme delight. If I heard of some great advancement in the world for me I do not think I would care much about it. But if I get any additional thought of the glory which pertains to Christ in that way I think I can say it is very great advancement to me, it is a very great rejoicing to me. And I think it would be so in regard to other saints. The more light we have as to the Bridegroom the more disposed we are to say "Come". The Father is working in us by His Spirit in order "That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God". There are two thoughts there I want to touch upon, one is that of expanse, and the other is what fills the expanse; breadth, length, depth and height -- that is the idea of expanse. What took place in regard to Abraham? God shewed him the expanse of the land of promise. Here we get an allusion to the land of purpose, that is the whole extent and expanse of divine purpose and blessings, that is the idea of breadth, and length, and depth, and height. It is the way in which God will display Himself; the immeasurable character of the universe of bliss. It cannot be measured -- God fills all. You are led into it by the Spirit of God at the present time. Very much as Abraham was permitted to view the expanse of the land of promise, so we get an idea of the expanse which is in the purpose of God. It is a great thought. It takes in heaven and earth. It takes in every family in which God will be known and expressed. Beyond all doubt it is in a very limited way, but I think one can in measure grasp the idea of that expanse in which the blessed God will be known and in which He will display Himself. The world to come is a most wonderful thought. It is not simply that everything is put under Christ, but everything then is in relation to Christ, everything
{410}
derives from Christ. It is that Christ gives character to all in the universe of bliss. A good father gives character to his family. Even a brother among brothers and sisters may give character to a family, and in the universe of bliss everything will take character from Christ. He is now far above all heavens that He may fill all things. "He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things". In the solar system the sun fills all in a way with light and warmth; in the universe of bliss Christ fills all with the character of God, so that everything is ruled in righteousness. "He will judge the world in righteousness". What will mark the world is that on the part of all in every direction there will be fidelity and the maintenance of divinely appointed relationships. Righteousness will be the first principle in the world to come, but there will be another principle which lies behind it, and that is love. Righteousness is always the outcome of love. The righteousness of God is dependent on what God is in love. Righteousness will be the moral rule of the world to come, by which everything will be held together in relation to God and to Christ. But at the same time what will lie behind righteousness is love. Love was the fulfilling of the law. The principle of law was righteousness. If a man had kept the law it would have been his righteousness. But the law demanded love. "Thou shalt love", &c. Love is really the fulfilling of the law. The apostle in his prayer refers to the expanse, the vastness of the expanse of that universe of bliss which is before God. What is to fill it all? The love of Christ which passeth knowledge. I believe it is a principle in regard to natural things; light consists in a series of waves, but there is another thing that you want -- something to put all these waves in motion. You want impulse. You get that fulfilled in Christ. In the universe of bliss all impulse originates in Christ. Christ is so known that He sets everything in movement. What I understand is this, that in the holy city Christ will be
{411}
the light, and everything is pervaded by Christ. Everything is perfectly according to God. The holy city touches the earthly company, that is Israel. And so, too, I have no doubt it will be all through the whole system; everything will be as it were impulsed, will be set in movement in the world to come by the love of Christ, so that the love of Christ will pervade all, "filled even to all the fulness of God". It is a blessed order of things in which God will be perfectly set forth. Thus when Christ was here on earth He declared God. That was the beginning, the complement of it all; the crown of it all is when Christ comes again in glory. Then, what He declared in testimony here when on earth, He will establish in power, and the whole universe of bliss will be established in righteousness, and all set in movement by the love of Christ. We are to know these things *now*. This is a time of intelligence, not a time of setting forth in power or display, but of intelligence by the Spirit of God. It is the moment of the full assurance of understanding, that is, that the Spirit of God works in saints divinely given intelligence. No one can overrate the importance of our being formed in divinely given intelligence by the Spirit of God. "The Spirit and the bride say, Come". The real spring of intelligence is love. Just as the spring of righteousness is love, so is the spring of intelligence. It is the one who loves who knows God. Love is really the spring of intelligence. Take Mary of Bethany. She got great intelligence, but I think it was because she had great love. The secret of her intelligence lay in love, and so it is in saints now. Being grounded and settled in love we shall advance exceedingly in intelligence. I am very sure in my own mind that love is the real seat of intelligence. John understood much more of Christ than did Peter. John loved the Lord and the Lord loved John, and John was very quick in point of intelligence. So it is with the saints now. You can only know love by love. You cannot know love by intelligence, though as I have said love
{412}
gives intelligence. It is only love that appreciates or estimates love. "To know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God". That is a wonderful thing to be brought about in saints. Like a faithful bride whose husband is away, the whole range of her interests centre in the bridegroom. "That ye may know the love of Christ". The bride says, "Come", because she knows the heart of Christ. "That ye may be filled even to all the fulness of God". That is, that the church might really be a true witness of God down here in the world, that God might be glorified in the church. That is the great end which the apostle desired. One may exclaim, Oh what a complete failure everything is! I grant it. But I ask whether this may not come true now. Do you think it is entirely impossible that the Father should strengthen us with might by His Spirit in the inner man? Do you think the Father would neglect to work with you? Every bit of failure was foreknown. It never took God by surprise. And do you think the Father ceases to work? I do not think so at all -- if you are prepared for it; but we *have* to be prepared for it; we have to understand how we are brought to God according to His nature, and how God is working in us according to His pleasure. I do not think God would engage to give us prosperity in the world. I think God would engage to supply our needs, but I do not think that in a world from which Christ is rejected God would engage to make a christian prosperous. Saints make a mistake in looking out for prosperity. I think God will work in us to any extent, there is no limit to the extent to which God would promote Christ in the hearts of the saints. He will work in them, strengthen them, that the Christ may dwell in their hearts by faith, and the effect will be beyond all question that they will get the most extraordinary blessed anticipation and unfolding of the scene of glory which is so shortly to be displayed and of which Christ is the beginning and centre. He is at the right hand of
{413}
God, and when He moves away it will be to establish the universe of bliss. We ought to be here now in anticipation of it, and to be able to take up the cry of the Spirit and bride -- "Come". We want the Bridegroom to come and to take up all that is for God and to establish the universe of bliss; we want the Lord to come in order that all may be of God and according to God.
{414}
CHRISTIAN GROUND
@Colossians 2: 1 - 23
What I desire to say a little about tonight is christian ground. It is a very important thing; it means the ground on which we are viewed by God here, and the only ground on which God could view us.
On previous evenings I have spoken of resurrection, and how our souls are in connection with the God of resurrection; no one knows the meaning of the death of Christ if he does not know resurrection. The real test of faith is the power of God in resurrection, so in scripture the greatest stress is laid on resurrection. See @1 Corinthians 15. The resurrection is the intervention of God's power, it is the real test of faith. The point is, whether we apprehend that the power of God has come in in raising Christ from the dead. It has been the principle of God's ways from Abraham's time. The God of glory called Abraham out, he was acquainted with the God of resurrection, and he is the father of us all; the whole family of faith are linked with Abraham by One who calls those things which be not as though they were. Everything originates with the God of glory; that means the power to recover, and that is in resurrection. If God raises again from the dead, He will set aside death and the effects of sin in this world. There may be death in the millennium but it will not be dominant. All depends on the great truth that God has raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. We find strength in faith as we lay hold of the strength of God in resurrection, that is where the strength of His power lies. Abraham laid hold of it, and also of acceptance.
I would speak of christian ground tonight. I will say *heavenly* ground, because christian ground *is* heavenly ground; heavenly ground belongs to the earth, you will not find it in Ephesians. It is the ground on which christians are on earth. In Ephesians you are united to
{415}
Christ in heaven and you are in heavenly places, that is the result of the power of God. But in Colossians we get heavenly ground, that is the ground on which christians are on earth. "Circumcised with the circumcision made without hands" and dead with Christ, is the ground which every baptised christian is really on before God. It is very important that we should rightly apprehend the ground on which God regards us. We have to face the great fact that His Son has been rejected here. God was for hundreds of years seeking fruit from man; He sent His Son, and they slew Him. It was impossible for God to go on longer on that line. Where the guilt of man culminated, God was glorified, and now He is seeking the glory of His Son and He is calling out those who are to be companions of His Son. Now that must be on the principle of resurrection; we must be raised or quickened. He is bringing many sons to glory, we are called to be companions of His Son in glory; that is sonship in scripture, and we shall be conformed to His image. We have not reached it yet, but now God is calling out a company to the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, that is the great basis. That is the ground we are on now; we are on earth, but we are on heavenly ground. God could not have to say to us on any other ground. Christ has been rejected in this world and has died out of it. How then could God have to say to me as alive in this world? It could not possibly be. We do not lay it to heart enough that we are left here in the scene where Christ died. The position which I occupy before God is that I have put off the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ and I am risen with Him through faith of the operation of God who hath raised Him from the dead; that is christian ground.
Look at chapter 1: 21 - 23. "You ... *now* hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death" -- (through the rent veil -- the body of His flesh) -- "to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight". That is what we are before God. We are
{416}
reconciled for this. I am in the consciousness that through the death of Christ I can be before God like this. I can approach with a true heart in full assurance. I referred to this passage to shew what reconciliation means in our case; we are not only reconciled, but we are reconciled in order to be presented holy and unblameable and unreproveable in His sight. You must keep the two things together. You are reconciled to be suitable to God. How could you talk of entering the holiest if you were not suitable to the holiest? The death of Christ was to make you suitable. You are made meet to have to do with the very holiest things. "We joy in God"; what could be holier than the secrets and thoughts of God? That is our privilege, but suitability is that I am reconciled in order to be presented holy, unblameable, unreproveable, before Him.
Another thought in regard to the christian is that we are called to the fellowship of His Son -- to be companions of Christ. He says, "in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee", that is on earth; it continues to the glory, but it is on earth. It is quoted from @Psalm 22. He speaks of what He will do to the great congregation, but He first declares His name to His brethren. It is *here*, "in the midst of the church" He will sing praise. That was verified in @John 20. He takes His place in the midst of the assembly, but He is on resurrection ground. How could we be His companions unless we were on resurrection ground too? When we are brought together in the assembly we are on resurrection ground; we could not be companions with Him otherwise. We have done there with the things of the wilderness here; we often carry a lot in, but we do not know what it is to be His companions in the assembly if we do. We are risen together with Him through faith of the operation of God, who hath raised Him from the dead. Before you can realise it you must recognise that it is the ground on which you are before God. It is christian ground, it is heavenly ground; every christian is on that ground before
{417}
God, whether he apprehends it or not. People have lost the idea of true christian ground, which is that we are dead, buried, and risen with Christ. The activity of God at the present moment is on the ground of the resurrection. God is calling out a people to be companions of His Son in glory. On that ground Christ takes His place in the assembly. Though not yet in heaven we are on heavenly ground. We are on the ground of the true circumcision. "As many of you as have been baptised into Christ, have put on Christ".
In verse 9 we read, "in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily". Christ's body has become the temple of Deity; all the completeness of the Godhead dwells in Him. There is no divine attribute that does not belong to Him, and yet it is "bodily" -- as a Man, that the fulness of the Godhead dwells in Him. That could not be said of the Father or of the Holy Spirit. There is a human as well as a divine side in Christ. He altered His form, but He could not alter His Person. And then it says, "ye are complete in him", that is, in Him as the exalted Man. It is from Him that I derive wisdom and intelligence and everything. If you want wisdom and intelligence how do you get it? In acquaintance with Christ.
Now we come to the other side. (Verse 12.) "Buried with him in baptism". That is connected with His cutting off. Verse 11 refers to chapter 1: 22. "Reconciled in the body of his flesh through death", in the language of circumcision, is cutting off. In the Old Testament it was a type; here we have the circumcision of *Christ*, which is the real thing. That is not a spiritual experience, it *involves* a spiritual experience, but it is not a spiritual experience, it is the ground we have taken. The flesh has been cut off in the death of Christ, and the flesh must not rule, that is the ground I take. "Putting off of the body of the flesh" is that it is a settled thing with me that flesh must not rule. The profession of a christian is this: I have put off the flesh by the death of Christ, I own that I
{418}
have adopted the circumcision of Christ. Flesh *does* rule in this world, and if I want to get on here I must let flesh rule; but the profession of a christian is this, that in consequence of flesh having been cut off in the death of Christ it *must now no longer rule*. That is an end to your prospects in this world, but God will take care of you. You may have to go to the wall; I have had to go to the wall, but it is not such a bad place after all, for you are under the care of God. If the flesh does not rule you *must* suffer in this world. We have been buried with Christ. Baptism is that man is out of sight, that is what baptism means. Buried out of sight is the only safe place in this world. It is a dangerous thing for a christian to be conspicuous here. The Lord's path was one of activity and obscurity, and that is the path for us here. When people lose the sense of God's approval they seek man's approval; man, as man, cannot exist without it; but when a christian seeks it it opens the door for the flesh to come in. You will have to adopt fleshly methods if you accept approval here. It is not a question of christian experience, but of christian ground -- flesh *must no longer rule because* it came to an end in the death of Christ. "Buried *with him* ... raised *with him*", you are a companion of Christ, you are on common ground with Him, you are not looking for prospects in this world, but you are risen with Christ, and your place on earth is in the assembly. You are fit for the assembly.
If you were not a companion of Christ you could not be fit for the assembly. The assembly is on earth, not in heaven, but it *belongs to heaven*. The things spoken of in Hebrews are heavenly things on earth. Their proper place is heaven, and the consummation is heaven, but it is while we are on the earth that we have them. Christ comes and takes His place in the assembly on earth, and He says, "In the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee". A christian by his profession recognises that he is a companion of Christ, on common ground with Him. In having to do with the holiest he is a companion
{419}
of Christ, as Aaron's sons were associated with him. Your privilege is the basis of your responsibility, your responsibility flows from your privilege; you cannot have privilege without responsibility. I have the privilege of having put off the body of the flesh, and I am a companion of Christ, suitable to be in the assembly; my responsibility flows from this. If flesh is no longer to rule, I am no longer alive in the world. The apostle challenges them on that ground. If you have put off the rule of the flesh, something else must rule, you cannot rule yourself. The Spirit must rule, and you have the Spirit; and I will tell you another thing, the Spirit will give you understanding. Christians do not covet understanding enough. They are too easily dogmatised. The apostle warns them about dogmatising. If a person comes and says, I must believe this or that in the letter, that is dogmatising. When God dealt with Israel He laid down dogmas for them. They were to obey and to wait to understand. He does not deal with christians like that. He gives me the Spirit of truth, in order that I may understand things. The first consequence of having put off the body of the flesh is that the Spirit rules, and He gives me entrance into the knowledge of God, and intelligence to enter into the mystery of God, where are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. (Chapter 2: 1, 2.) What a field is laid open to us! How much have your hearts been exercised to get an entrance into the knowledge of the mystery of God? We are so occupied with the things of time, we do not give the Spirit room to lead us into the mystery of God.
Then in chapter 3: 1 there is another thing, we get there the new centre of christianity, "where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God". There is the great centre; Christ is enthroned. Christ is sitting in the place of supreme honour. What is to flow out of that? All God's ways start from there. When He moves from that place it is that all God's will may be accomplished; we have only to await that movement. It is in that way that the heart of
{420}
the christian is taken out of the world. We have to remember that our treasure is there. The essence of our blessing is that we are associated with Christ in glory. You must be content to be obscure *now*, your life is hid with Christ in God, it is not yet manifested, it is only known to faith. *Then* we shall come out in publicity, *now* we are to be hid.
The world is a false system which God will not go on with. It is not changed, and never will be changed until Christ comes, but the change takes place in us now. We have put off the rule of the flesh that qualified us for living in this world, and we have come into the assembly as Christ's companions. The great centre of our interests is where Christ is sitting. What if He moves? Our bodies will be fashioned like unto His. It is a great thing to get your thoughts to the right hand of God where Christ is. I believe that we have to go back and learn what is the first principle of the gospel. The whole basis of God's dealings with man now is that He has made a marriage for His Son, God has made a festivity for His Son, and the first provision for the honour of His Son is that He should have companions in glory. He calls us to be His companions in glory, and in the meantime we are called to be His companions in the assembly now. That is the ground we are on, whether we realise it or not, it is the only ground on which we could be before God. We are associated in the assembly with God's Son, we are united to Him in glory, which I have not touched on tonight. I know little of it.
May God give us to see clearly that flesh must not rule. It is a subtle thing, and it suits us for this world. We are risen with Christ and we are companions with Christ in the assembly, that is where we are on earth, beloved friends.
{421}
THE SAINTS HERE FOR GOD'S PLEASURE
@Colossians 2: 13; @Colossians 3: 17
We get a great result reached in this chapter (2), the practice in which the saints are to be down here, under the eye of God, that which is entirely for His pleasure. It was the case when Christ was here personally, God's eye rested on one spot with the greatest, most infinite satisfaction and pleasure, at every moment of His pathway, and in everything He did there was infinite satisfaction to His Father. The Lord Jesus could say, "The Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him". The earth was adorned when God made Paradise, but how much more when He was here on whom the eye of God could rest with unmingled satisfaction; the earth was adorned in the eye of God with the presence of Christ. In chapter 3 the thought is continued, that is, the new man here still under the eye of God. It affords unalloyed satisfaction to God. I connect it in my own mind with @John 17, only that *that* takes the other side of it. (See verse 21.) "That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me". That refers to the present, because the object and point of it is that the world might *see*; what the world was to see was the unity of the saints. The source and spring of that unity they could not understand. This comes out in Colossians, Christ is all and in all. They are looked at as one in Christ. That is the supposition; what the exhortation leads to, is that the saints are walking here in relation to one another in the grace of Christ, and that as one whole. Under the eye of God they present the beauty and the fragrance of Christ. The world does not appreciate the fragrance, the fragrance is for God, but the unity which is the result is for the world to see. In @John 17 it results in testimony to
{422}
the world -- "That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me". "One in us" (that is, in the divine nature) "that the world may see", that is, that the testimony may be *to* the world. See how much is lost in testimony to the world through the brokenness of the saints, because they are not walking together in the grace of Christ, and the unity of the divine nature, and yielding fragrance to God. There is so little testimony to the world. But God in the long run is not going to be thwarted, and the world will see the testimony, because it is to be perfected in the glory. But it is very poor now, and it is not mended by evangelical alliances. The way to be right is to go back to *first* principles.
What we have to look to first is the fragrance for *God*; that is the end to begin at. People think so much about presenting a good front to the world, but that is the wrong end to begin at. The point is to be acceptable to God. See what the saints are before God. "Elect of God, holy and beloved" -- that is what Christ Himself was, and it is what they are before God, and they are all to be marked by the grace of Christ. If you read down you see what they are to put on. "*Put on* therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering"; that is, that they might be fragrant to God by the beauty of Christ being expressed by them to one another, and the result would be testimony, for the unity would be expressed in their ways. I have no confidence in anything that man can do to effect unity. I do not believe in the character of anything except what God does; God only can work, and I am more and more convinced of this, that no effort of man can bring in divine unity.
I want to shew what the teaching leads up to. Doctrine is to result in practice. Chapters 1 and 2 present doctrine. In chapter 3 we come to practice. I want first to speak about the doctrine and the positive work of God in the
{423}
saints -- the practical bearing of it. Here it passes on to practice. It becomes first *practical* and then practice. The apprehension of the christian standing and the work of God in us becomes practical to us, and then it results in practice. Every true christian is dead and risen with Christ. We all have to learn this. Once I thought I was a better man for this world, and safe for the next world, and I suppose a large proportion of christians have that idea of christianity. But christianity and the true power of it connects itself with being dead and risen with Christ. It is not a question of attainment, but it has to be realised. I have done with the world, and I am risen with Christ. If dead to the world I am dead morally, religiously and intellectually. That is putting off of the body of the flesh in the circumcision of Christ -- I am accepted with God. I am risen, associated with Christ, and in touch with heaven. That is not attainment, but I should insist as much as any one that it is a matter of realisation. If we are risen with Christ, it has to be realised, I do not weaken that, but it is true of us as before God. The truth of God *is* the truth of God and the standing of the christian *is* the standing of the christian whether realised or not. Considering what the world is, it is not possible that God could have to say to us at all on any other ground save as dead and risen. It is as risen with Christ that God has to say to us. He has shewn us that the present line of His actings is on resurrection ground, so it says, "Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead".
In @Romans 4 we are justified on that ground, on the ground of faith in resurrection. It says, "But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead". God has shewn His acceptance of Christ by raising Him from the dead. In the eye of God who raised Christ from the dead we are accounted righteous. That is the doctrine of @Romans 4. Here (Colossians) we get the further truth --
{424}
that we are risen together with Him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised Him from the dead. (Chapter 2: 12.) Every christian believes in God who raised Jesus from the dead. Resurrection is the real test of faith, we get no certainty until we believe in the resurrection; the work of Christ would be of no value to us without His resurrection. That we get in @1 Corinthians 15. The penalty of death could not be gone if Christ had not been raised. In @Romans 4 and 5 there is no penalty on the believer, but here (@Colossians 3) we get more, something further -- (1) Our *persons* are accepted. (2) In the eye of God you are in association with Christ, and (3) you are in touch with heaven. These three things convey the idea of being risen together with Christ. Just as Christ was raised from the dead and God has accepted Him, so we are risen with Him and accepted in the Beloved. The more we see that we are risen with Christ the more our eyes are heavenward; the eye of the believer is that way, just waiting to go in. "Our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ". We are looking heavenward. Our eyes are in that direction whither the Forerunner is for us entered. We are in touch with heaven; in the eye of God we are in association with the One who is in heaven.
Now I want to speak a little of the work of God in us -- the positive work of God in the believer. See verses 13, 14, 15. There is an expression used here which takes us back to Abraham (Abraham is the father of us all). It is "*quickened*". In @Romans 4: 17 it is said of Abraham that he believed in God who quickeneth the dead, in the God who makes alive the dead. Here we have the *work of God* in the believer -- a positive work of God which makes him fit for heaven. That is the force of the expression, "quickened together with him". When Christ was raised from the dead He was the same Person, but He was raised in a condition suited to the place He was about to take; He was no less *Man*, but He was no longer in the condition of flesh and blood. He was the expression
{425}
in resurrection of the exceeding greatness of God's power, so that as Man He could be raised far above all principality and power. It was not a condition of flesh and blood. His position when here after the flesh was unique, nothing like it, but in resurrection He was the expression of the mighty power of God who raised Him from the dead, suited to the place He was about to take far above all principality and power. Now what we read here is, "You ... hath he quickened together with him", that is, we are made alive as to the state of our souls. That is the condition of the believer as to his soul, though he has not done with responsible life here, but as to his soul he is quickened, by the same power which raised Christ from the dead; he is made fit to live in a totally new order in association with Christ where He now is. The man who is quickened is no longer in the old order. We are quickened by the power of God to live after an entirely new order as risen with Christ, and in association with Him in heaven. The body is not yet quickened. We await that. What is the practical result? That I can live in the utmost familiarity and intimacy with God Himself. That was not the case with Adam in paradise. The result of quickening in the believer is that it sets him in touch not only with heaven, but with all that is in heaven, it fits him to live with God in the closest intimacy and communion. It does not come out fully yet, for we have to go on with the old order for a moment. We have still to do with the flesh. I have often compared it to a dissolving view, the old has not passed away completely, but the new has come in. The quickening power of God places and fits us for suitability to live in the closest relationship with God in heaven. It is a tremendous thing, we have not much sense of it, but how *wonderful* that we can dare to be intimate with God! What a wonderful thing for the christian to find that he has the power to be intimate with God!
I was connecting this last week with the assembly. I
{426}
believe this qualifies us for the assembly; we can take our places in the assembly; what He invites us to is, to be in association with Himself. Do you think He would keep us at a distance from Himself? No, we are fit to be His companions. "He that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren". I am in the closest companionship to Christ. He has made me to live, to answer to His own blessed nature. The nearer I am and the more I use it, the more it is increased to me, I cannot trade too much on it; we do not get enough of it here; we shall in heaven. "Holy and without blame before him in love" is the result of the quickening power of God. Do you think that we need fear losing reverence because we have to say to God in such close intimacy? What tries me is the thought how much comes in to obstruct my enjoyment of the blessed privilege which I have of nearness to God as the result of His quickening power.
I just add a word as to what comes after, (verse 14.) "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross". Three barriers are taken out of the way; (1) trespasses, (2) ordinances, (3) principalities, that is, the power of death, what was really in Satan's hand. All this is taken out of the way, so that the ground should be perfectly clear. God has taken them all out of the way. They are all gone. First, "trespasses", that question cannot come in. Secondly, "ordinances", that cannot come in; and more than that, principalities and powers are spoiled. Christ by His death has taken the power of death out of the hand of Satan, so that the ground should be clear between God and those whom God has quickened.
Now I come to what is *practical*, verse 20, "Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances". This passage is *very* important. The
{427}
apostle will not allow them to look at themselves as alive in the world at all. Putting off the body of the flesh is a strong statement. It is what a man does actually when he dies. Buried with Him in baptism. The man who is that, is no longer controlled by the flesh, that is certain. That is the ground the christian takes. He is circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, he is no longer entitled to act in the flesh because he has put off the body of the flesh, and is no longer under the control of it. As I said before, the christian is viewed as dead to the world in three ways, morally, intellectually and religiously. Look at what the world is morally; "The lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life", that is not of the Father but is of the world. That will not do for me. Intellectually! It does not attract me in any way. Philosophy begins at the wrong end. It begins from man to God, that is beginning at the wrong end. We begin with God and work downwards. Religiously! that is dogmatism, in which there is nothing moral or spiritual. There is a great deal of worship (so-called) in the present day which is dogmatical. People do not understand what they are doing. The apostle will not allow that. He says, "why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances?"
We need not go far to find people who are fond of that sort of thing, keeping feasts and fasts, &c. The apostle will not allow it for a moment. Why? Because there is nothing spiritual in it, and we are in the place of closest intimacy with Christ; we cannot be in touch with the world in any way, either morally, intellectually or religiously. I accept the place of dead to the world. The more we have to do with God in our souls, the more we can understand the truth of our position, and the more we shall understand why God could have nothing to say to us viewed in any way, save as dead to the world. It could not be otherwise. God knows what the world is, and He cannot own it in any sense; and the character and line of His actings is that He has taken us out of it. He
{428}
has done with the world.
Now the other side is, chapter 3, "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God". Now there are two things I want to draw your attention to without which I do not think you can understand what "the things above" are. We have to take into account two facts, (1) redemption has been accomplished, and (2) Christ is glorified. If we apprehend the significance of these two facts we shall begin to understand the "things above". Redemption accomplished is the basis for the accomplishment of all God's purposes. Everything which God is establishing as the fruit of His counsels is on the ground of redemption, and Christ is exalted so that those purposes and counsels can be displayed. In Christ all is established. The heavenly Jerusalem is one of the "things above". In Christ raised and exalted we get the foundation of the heavenly city. What is it? A company where God dwells without a temple. In @Hebrews 12 we find it is what is spoken to us from heaven. In Christ risen and exalted there is the foundation of the city -- God's fixed dwelling-place where He can dwell without a temple. That is the new Jerusalem. How could that come to pass? Because redemption is accomplished and Christ is exalted.
Then there is another thought connected with "things above". Christ is the "first-born among many brethren". There is a company in heaven who by the grace of God are associated with Christ. The first-born is there, just as the foundation of the city is there, that in all things He might have the pre-eminence; or if we look at the truth of the body, Christ the Head is there and the body is united to Him. All the results of redemption are there; spirits of just men made perfect. Jesus the Mediator is there before the throne of God, and the blood of sprinkling is there too; the blood "that speaketh better things than that of Abel". Everything is there in the Person of Jesus at the right hand of God for the administration
{429}
here on earth of eternal redemption. All these things hang on two points -- Christ exalted and redemption accomplished. In Christ is the foundation of all that God is going to lay in heaven. In His hands is the administration of all the counsels of God. He is exalted far above all heavens that He might fill all things. He took up every moral question on the cross, and He took up here every thread of responsibility and glorified God in it, and He is the One who is going to undo the entanglement of good and evil which the devil has brought in. Who could disentangle these things except Christ? Good and evil are mixed up in utter moral confusion. The work of Christ is to disentangle everything that has become confused. He will undo the works of the devil. He has settled every question at the cross, and He will perfectly accomplish His work. At the end the good and evil will be perfectly separated; each one gets to its own place; on one hand, the lake of fire, and on the other a wondrous scene, the new heavens and new earth where there is nothing but good. It is all settled, not in an arbitrary way, even the wicked will be convinced of the righteousness and justness of what is done.
Now I will just refer again to "things above". The apostle says, "have your mind on things that are above". If you read this in connection with @Hebrews 12: 22, 23, you will see how the "things above" are before us. "Ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of the first-born, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect". All these are the "things above", spoken of from God's level in heaven. These are the "things above" which are established in Christ as fruit of redemption.
Now we come to practice. If we are to be here for His pleasure our minds must be kept occupied with the
{430}
things in which God's pleasure is expressed. God finds His pleasure in those things, the foundation of which is laid in the Person of Christ. We cannot be for His pleasure if we are not occupied in mind and spirit with things above, where Christ is sitting at His right hand. Christ there is the settlement and witness that all God's ways find their resting place in Him. Are we there in mind and spirit? It is a question which tests most of us, and the result of it in practice will be that we shall come out in the reality of our profession -- the putting off the old man and putting on the new. The old man will not do for us now. Then the apostle tells us what the character of the new man is -- "Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all. Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long suffering". Suppose the whole christian company were doing this! Suppose we all were occupied with the things above, the things which God speaks of from heaven!
See the eagerness with which the man of the world reads the news of the day in his paper. God has been pleased to speak *from heaven* of that which is connected with the world to come, all that He has accomplished, in redemption accomplished, and Christ exalted. If our minds and thoughts and affections were in those things, the result would be that we should all wish to act in relation to each other in the grace of Christ, we should want to walk in tender, Christ-like affection towards each other, so that there might be fragrance for God. Do you think there would be the biting and devouring one another if this were the case? People who do so are under law, they have not accepted death to the world, morally, intellectually and religiously. But if our minds are set on things above, the result in practice would be that there would be something fragrant for God, and likewise testimony to the world. There would be unity. The world
{431}
might not be able to account for the unity, but they would see it. It has been compared to a clock, the works are not seen, but the hands point to the time, and any one may see that. That illustrates what I want to point out. Christian ground is dead and risen with Christ; but not only that, God has made it effectual in our souls. As to our souls, we are made to live before God after a new order, the order of Christ risen from the dead, so that we should be fitted to live with Him in the closest intimacy and nearness. God has removed every hindrance out of the way. He has forgiven us all trespasses, blotted out the handwriting of ordinances which was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to His cross, and having spoiled principalities and powers, He made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it. It is a great thing to accept the place of being dead to the world. The link to it was broken in Christ's death. I was once bound to it morally, intellectually and religiously. God has not put the world right yet; what He has done is, He has cut the link to it for us, and we are entitled to take the place of being dead to it. Under the eye of God I am no more alive in the world. But more -- He says, as it were, 'I will not cast you on the negative', "If ye then be risen ... seek those things which are above". Where do you seek them? Here on the earth. I want the furtherance of the heavenly city, and the furtherance of the assembly, and the furtherance of the redemption which Christ has accomplished. If you are risen with Christ, set your mind on these things.
Then we go on to the practice in keeping with it. We are true to our profession of having put off of the body of the flesh. Putting off the old man and putting on the new, we walk here as a christian company, ministering fragrance to God and bearing testimony to the world. We are here for a moment to be in Christ's place before the world, as we are in His place before the Father. (See @John 17). We have to begin at the right end, even that we
{432}
have died to the world, have put off the old man and put on the new, and what we have to look for here is the promotion of the grace of Christ in ourselves and in one another.
