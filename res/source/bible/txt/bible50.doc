1  Paul and Timotheus, bondmen of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with [the] overseers and ministers; Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:
2  grace to you, and peace from God our Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ. Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and [from] the Lord Jesus Christ.
3  I thank my God for my whole remembrance of you, I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,
4  constantly in my every supplication, making the supplication for you all with joy, Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,
5  because of your fellowship with the gospel, from the first day until now; For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;
6  having confidence of this very thing, that he who has begun in you a good work will complete it unto Jesus Christ's day: Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform [it] until the day of Jesus Christ:
7  as it is righteous for me to think this as to you all, because ye have *me* in your hearts, and that both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the glad tidings ye are all participators in my grace. Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.
8  For God is my witness how I long after you all in [the] bowels of Christ Jesus. For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.
9  And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in full knowledge and all intelligence, And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and [in] all judgment;
10  that ye may judge of and approve the things that are more excellent, in order that ye may be pure and without offence for Christ's day, That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ;
11  being complete as regards the fruit of righteousness, which [is] by Jesus Christ, to God's glory and praise. Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.
12  But I would have you know, brethren, that the circumstances in which I am have turned out rather to the furtherance of the glad tidings, But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things [which happened] unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;
13  so that my bonds have become manifest [as being] in Christ in all the praetorium and to all others; So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other [places];
14  and that the most of the brethren, trusting in [the] Lord through my bonds, dare more abundantly to speak the word of God fearlessly. And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.
15  Some indeed also for envy and strife, but some also for good will, preach the Christ. Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:
16  These indeed out of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the glad tidings; The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:
17  but those out of contention, announce the Christ, not purely, supposing to arouse tribulation for my bonds. But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.
18  What is it then? at any rate, in every way, whether in pretext or in truth, Christ is announced; and in this I rejoice, yea, also I will rejoice; What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.
19  for I know that this shall turn out for me to salvation, through your supplication and [the] supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ; For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
20  according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but in all boldness, as always, now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether by life or by death. According to my earnest expectation and [my] hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but [that] with all boldness, as always, [so] now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether [it be] by life, or by death.
21  For for me to live [is] Christ, and to die gain; For to me to live [is] Christ, and to die [is] gain.
22  but if to live in flesh [is my lot], this is for me worth the while: and what I shall choose I cannot tell. But if I live in the flesh, this [is] the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.
23  But I am pressed by both, having the desire for departure and being with Christ, [for] [it is] very much better, For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:
24  but remaining in the flesh [is] more necessary for your sakes; Nevertheless to abide in the flesh [is] more needful for you.
25  and having confidence of this, I know that I shall remain and abide along with you all, for your progress and joy in faith; And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;
26  that your boasting may abound in Christ Jesus through me by my presence again with you. That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.
27  Only conduct yourselves worthily of the glad tidings of the Christ, in order that whether coming and seeing you, or absent, I may hear of what concerns you, that ye stand firm in one spirit, with one soul, labouring together in the same conflict with the faith of the glad tidings; Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;
28  and not frightened in anything by the opposers, which is to them a demonstration of destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God; And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.
29  because to you has been given, as regards Christ, not only the believing on him but the suffering for him also, For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;
30  having the same conflict which ye have seen in me, and now hear of in me. Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear [to be] in me.
{2}
1  If then [there be] any comfort in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of [the] Spirit, if any bowels and compassions, If [there be] therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,
2  fulfil my joy, that ye may think the same thing, having the same love, joined in soul, thinking one thing; Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, [being] of one accord, of one mind.
3  [let] nothing [be] in the spirit of strife or vain glory, but, in lowliness of mind, each esteeming the other as more excellent than themselves; [Let] nothing [be done] through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.
4  regarding not each his own [qualities], but each those of others also. Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.
5  For let this mind be in you which [was] also in Christ Jesus; Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:
6  who, subsisting in the form of God, did not esteem it an object of rapine to be on an equality with God; Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:
7  but emptied himself, taking a bondman's form, taking his place in [the] likeness of men; But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:
8  and having been found in figure as a man, humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and [that the] death of [the] cross. And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
9  Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and granted him a name, that which is above every name, Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:
10  that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of heavenly and earthly and infernal [beings], That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of [things] in heaven, and [things] in earth, and [things] under the earth;
11  and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ [is] Lord to God [the] Father's glory. And [that] every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ [is] Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
12  So that, my beloved, even as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much rather in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
13  for it is God who works in you both the willing and the working according to [his] good pleasure. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of [his] good pleasure.
14  Do all things without murmurings and reasonings, Do all things without murmurings and disputings:
15  that ye may be harmless and simple, irreproachable children of God in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation; among whom ye appear as lights in [the] world, That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;
16  holding forth [the] word of life, so as to be a boast for me in Christ's day, that I have not run in vain nor laboured in vain. Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.
17  But if also I am poured out as a libation on the sacrifice and ministration of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice in common with you all. Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.
18  In like manner do *ye* also rejoice, and rejoice with me. For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.
19  But I hope in [the] Lord Jesus to send Timotheus to you shortly, that *I* also may be refreshed, knowing how ye get on. But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.
20  For I have no one like-minded who will care with genuine feeling how ye get on. For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.
21  For all seek their own things, not the things of Jesus Christ. For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.
22  But ye know the proof of him, that, as a child a father, he has served with me in the work of the glad tidings. But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.
23  Him therefore I hope to send immediately, as soon as I shall see how it goes with me: Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.
24  but I trust in [the] Lord that I myself also shall soon come; But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.
25  but I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-workman and fellow-soldier, but your messenger and minister to my need, Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.
26  since he had a longing desire after you all, and was distressed because ye had heard that he was sick; For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.
27  for he was also sick close to death, but God had mercy on him, and not indeed on him alone, but also on me, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow. For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.
28  I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that seeing him ye might again rejoice, and that *I* might be the less sorrowful. I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.
29  Receive him therefore in [the] Lord with all joy, and hold such in honour; Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:
30  because for the sake of the work he drew near even to death, venturing his life that he might fill up what lacked in your ministration toward me. Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.

1  For the rest, my brethren, rejoice in [the] Lord: to write the same things to you, to me [is] not irksome, and for you safe. Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed [is] not grievous, but for you [it is] safe.
2  See to dogs, see to evil workmen, see to the concision. Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.
3  For *we* are the circumcision, who worship by [the] Spirit of God, and boast in Christ Jesus, and do not trust in flesh. For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.
4  Though *I* have [my] trust even in flesh; if any other think to trust in flesh, *I* rather: Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:
5  as to circumcision, [I received it] the eighth day; of [the] race of Israel, of [the] tribe of Benjamin, Hebrew of Hebrews; as to [the] law, a Pharisee; Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, [of] the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;
6  as to zeal, persecuting the assembly; as to righteousness which [is] in [the] law, found blameless; Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.
7  but what things were gain to me these I counted, on account of Christ, loss. But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.
8  But surely I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all, and count them to be filth, that I may gain Christ; Yea doubtless, and I count all things [but] loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them [but] dung, that I may win Christ,
9  and that I may be found in him, not having my righteousness, which [would be] on the principle of law, but that which is by faith of Christ, the righteousness which [is] of God through faith, And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:
10  to know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death, That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;
11  if any way I arrive at the resurrection from among [the] dead. If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.
12  Not that I have already obtained [the prize], or am already perfected; but I pursue, if also I may get possession [of it], seeing that also I have been taken possession of by Christ [Jesus]. Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.
13  Brethren, *I* do not count to have got possession myself; but one thing -- forgetting the things behind, and stretching out to the things before, Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but [this] one thing [I do], forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,
14  I pursue, [looking] towards [the] goal, for the prize of the calling on high of God in Christ Jesus. I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
15  As many therefore as [are] perfect, let us be thus minded; and if ye are any otherwise minded, this also God shall reveal to you. Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.
16  But whereto we have attained, [let us] walk in the same steps. Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.
17  Be imitators [all] together of me, brethren, and fix your eyes on those walking thus as you have us for a model; Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample.
18  (for many walk of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they [are] the enemies of the cross of Christ: (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, [that they are] the enemies of the cross of Christ:
19  whose end [is] destruction, whose god [is] the belly, and [their] glory in their shame, who mind earthly things:) Whose end [is] destruction, whose God [is their] belly, and [whose] glory [is] in their shame, who mind earthly things.)
20  for *our* commonwealth has its existence in [the] heavens, from which also we await the Lord Jesus Christ [as] Saviour, For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:
21  who shall transform our body of humiliation into conformity to his body of glory, according to the working of [the] power which he has even to subdue all things to himself. Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.
{4}
1  So that, my brethren, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, thus stand fast in [the] Lord, beloved. Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, [my] dearly beloved.
2  I exhort Euodia, and exhort Syntyche, to be of the same mind in [the] Lord; I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.
3  yea, I ask thee also, true yokefellow, assist them, who have contended along with me in the glad tidings, with Clement also, and my other fellow-labourers, whose names [are] in [the] book of life. And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and [with] other my fellowlabourers, whose names [are] in the book of life.
4  Rejoice in [the] Lord always: again I will say, Rejoice. Rejoice in the Lord alway: [and] again I say, Rejoice.
5  Let your gentleness be known of all men. The Lord [is] near. Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord [is] at hand.
6  Be careful about nothing; but in everything, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.
7  and the peace of God, which surpasses every understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts by Christ Jesus. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
8  For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things [are] true, whatsoever things [are] noble, whatsoever things [are] just, whatsoever things [are] pure, whatsoever things [are] amiable, whatsoever things [are] of good report; if [there be] any virtue and if any praise, think on these things. Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things [are] honest, whatsoever things [are] just, whatsoever things [are] pure, whatsoever things [are] lovely, whatsoever things [are] of good report; if [there be] any virtue, and if [there be] any praise, think on these things.
9  What ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, these things do; and the God of peace shall be with you. Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.
10  But I rejoiced in [the] Lord greatly, that now however at length ye have revived your thinking of me, though surely ye did also think [of me], but lacked opportunity. But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.
11  Not that I speak as regards privation, for as to me *I* have learnt in those circumstances in which I am, to be satisfied in myself. Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, [therewith] to be content.
12  I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound. In everything and in all things I am initiated both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer privation. I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.
13  I have strength for all things in him that gives me power. I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.
14  But ye have done well in taking part in my affliction. Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.
15  And know also *ye*, O Philippians, that in [the] beginning of the gospel, when I came out of Macedonia, no assembly communicated [anything] to me in [the] way of giving and receiving save *ye* alone; Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.
16  for also in Thessalonica once and even twice ye sent to me for my need. For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.
17  Not that I seek gift, but I seek fruit abounding to your account. Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.
18  But I have all things in full supply and abound; I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things [sent] from you, an odour of sweet savour, an acceptable sacrifice, agreeable to God. But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things [which were sent] from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.
19  But my God shall abundantly supply all your need according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.
20  But to our God and Father [be] glory to the ages of ages. Amen. Now unto God and our Father [be] glory for ever and ever. Amen.
21  Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who [are] with me salute you. Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you.
22  All the saints salute you, and specially those of the household of Caesar. All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household.
23  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit. Amen. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all. Amen. <<[To [the] Philippians written from Rome, by Epaphroditus.]>>
