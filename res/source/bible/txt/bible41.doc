31  As to a grain of mustard [seed], which, when it is sown upon the earth, is less than all seeds which are upon the earth, [It is] like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:
32  and when it has been sown, mounts up and becomes greater than all herbs, and produces great branches, so that the birds of heaven can roost under its shadow.

1  And the Pharisees and some of the scribes, coming from Jerusalem, are gathered together to him, Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.
2  and seeing some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is, unwashed, hands, And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.
3  (for the Pharisees and all the Jews, unless they wash their hands diligently, do not eat, holding what has been delivered by the ancients; For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash [their] hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.
4  and [on coming] from the market-place, unless they are washed, they do not eat; and there are many other things which they have received to hold, the washing of cups and vessels, and brazen utensils, and couches), And [when they come] from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, [as] the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.
5  then the Pharisees and the scribes ask him, Why do thy disciples not walk according to what has been delivered by the ancients, but eat the bread with defiled hands? Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?
6  But he answering said to them, Well did Esaias prophesy concerning you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honour me with their lips, but their heart is far away from me. He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with [their] lips, but their heart is far from me.
7  But in vain do they worship me, teaching [as their] teachings commandments of men. Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching [for] doctrines the commandments of men.
8  [For], leaving the commandment of God, ye hold what is delivered by men [to keep] -- washings of vessels and cups, and many other such like things ye do. For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, [as] the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.
9  And he said to them, Well do ye set aside the commandment of God, that ye may observe what is delivered by yourselves [to keep]. And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.
10  For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, he who speaks ill of father or mother, let him surely die. For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:
11  But <i>ye</i> say, If a man say to his father or his mother, [It is] corban (that is, gift), whatsoever thou mightest have profit from me by... But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, [It is] Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; [he shall be free].
12  And ye no longer suffer him to do anything for his father or his mother; And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;
13  making void the word of God by your traditional teaching which ye have delivered; and many such like things ye do. Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.
14  And having called again the crowd, he said to them, Hear me, all [of you], and understand: And when he had called all the people [unto him], he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one [of you], and understand:
15  There is nothing from outside a man entering into him which can defile him; but the things which go out from him, those it is which defile the man. There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.
16  If any one have ears to hear, let him hear. If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
17  And when he went indoors from the crowd, his disciples asked him concerning the parable. And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.
18  And he says to them, Are <i>ye</i> also thus unintelligent? Do ye not perceive that all that is outside entering into the man cannot defile him, And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, [it] cannot defile him;
19  because it does not enter into his heart but into his belly, and goes out into the draught, purging all meats? Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?
20  And he said, That which goes forth out of the man, that defiles the man. And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.

30  that shall not receive a hundredfold now in this time: houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions, and in the coming age life eternal. But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.

Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave [his] wife [behind him], and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
20  There were seven brethren; and the first took a wife, and dying did not leave seed; Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.
21  and the second took her and died, and neither did he leave seed; and the third likewise. And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.
22  And the seven [took her and] did not leave seed. Last of all the woman also died. And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.

26  But concerning the dead that they rise, have ye not read in the book of Moses, in [the section of] the bush, how God spoke to him, saying, <i>I</i> [am] the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?

30  and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thine understanding, and with all thy strength. This is [the] first commandment. And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this [is] the first commandment.

33  and to love him with all the heart, and with all the intelligence, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbour as one's self, is more than all the burnt-offerings and sacrifices. And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love [his] neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.
34  And Jesus, seeing that he had answered intelligently, said to him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no one dared question him any more. And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him [any question].
35  And Jesus answering said [as he was] teaching in the temple, How do the scribes say that the Christ is son of David? And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David?
36  [for] David himself said [speaking] in the Holy Spirit, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand until I put thine enemies [as] footstool of thy feet. For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.
37  David himself [therefore] calls him Lord, and whence is he his son? And the mass of the people heard him gladly. David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he [then] his son? And the common people heard him gladly.
38  And he said to them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, who like to walk about in long robes, and salutations in the marketplaces, And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and [love] salutations in the marketplaces,
39  and first seats in the synagogues, and first places at suppers; And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:

43  And having called his disciples to [him] he said to them, Verily I say unto you, This poor widow has cast in more than all who have cast into the treasury: And he called [unto him] his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:
44  for all have cast in of that which they had in abundance, but she of her destitution has cast in all that she had, the whole of her living. For all [they] did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, [even] all her living.

1  And as he was going out of the temple, one of his disciples says to him, Teacher, see what stones and what buildings! And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings [are here]!
2  And Jesus answering said to him, Seest thou these great buildings? not a stone shall be left upon a stone, which shall not be thrown down. And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.

7  But when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be not disturbed, for [this] must happen, but the end is not yet. And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for [such things] must needs be; but the end [shall] not [be] yet.
8  For nation shall rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be earthquakes in [different] places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these things [are the] beginnings of throes. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these [are] the beginnings of sorrows.
9  But <i>ye</i>, take heed to yourselves, for they shall deliver you up to sanhedrims and to synagogues: ye shall be beaten and brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them; But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.
10  and the gospel must first be preached to all the nations. And the gospel must first be published among all nations.
11  But when they shall lead you away to deliver you up, be not careful beforehand as to what ye shall say, [nor prepare your discourse]: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak; for <i>ye</i> are not the speakers, but the Holy Spirit. But when they shall lead [you], and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.

13  And ye will be hated of all on account of my name; but he that has endured to the end, <i>he</i> shall be saved. And ye shall be hated of all [men] for my name's sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
14  But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation standing where it should not, (he that reads let him consider [it],) then let those in Judaea flee to the mountains; But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:
15  and him that is upon the housetop not come down into the house, nor enter [into it] to take away anything out of his house; And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter [therein], to take any thing out of his house:
16  and him that is in the field not return back to take his garment. And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.

19  for those days shall be distress such as there has not been the like since [the] beginning of creation which God created, until now, and never shall be; For [in] those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.

And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the [mother] of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.
2  And very early on the first [day] of the week they come to the sepulchre, the sun having risen. And very early in the morning the first [day] of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.
3  And they said to one another, Who shall roll us away the stone out of the door of the sepulchre? And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?
4  And when they looked, they see that the stone has been rolled [away], for it was very great. And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.
5  And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right, clothed in a white robe, and they were amazed and alarmed; And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.
6  but he says to them, Be not alarmed. Ye seek Jesus, the Nazarene, the crucified one. He is risen, he is not here; behold the place where they had put him. And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.
7  But go, tell his disciples and Peter, he goes before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him, as he said to you. But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.
8  And they went out, and fled from the sepulchre. And trembling and excessive amazement possessed them, and they said nothing to any one, for they were afraid. And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any [man]; for they were afraid.
9  Now when he had risen very early, the first [day] of the week, he appeared first to Mary of Magdala, out of whom he had cast seven demons. Now when [Jesus] was risen early the first [day] of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.
10  <i>She</i> went and brought word to those that had been with him, [who were] grieving and weeping. [And] she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.
11  And when these heard that he was alive and had been seen of her, they disbelieved [it]. And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.
12  And after these things he was manifested in another form to two of them as they walked, going into the country; After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.
13  and <i>they</i> went and brought word to the rest; neither did they believe them. And they went and told [it] unto the residue: neither believed they them.
14  Afterwards as they lay at table he was manifested to the eleven, and reproached [them with] their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who had seen him risen. Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.
15  And he said to them, Go into all the world, and preach the glad tidings to all the creation. And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.
16  He that believes and is baptised shall be saved, and he that disbelieves shall be condemned. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.
17  And these signs shall follow those that have believed: in my name they shall cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues; And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;
18  they shall take up serpents; and if they should drink any deadly thing it shall not injure them; they shall lay hands upon the infirm, and they shall be well. They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.
19  The Lord therefore, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat at the right hand of God. So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.
20  And they, going forth, preached everywhere, the Lord working with [them], and confirming the word by the signs following upon [it]. And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with [them], and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.
