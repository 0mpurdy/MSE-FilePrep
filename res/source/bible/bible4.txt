1  And Jehovah spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai in the tent of meeting, on the first of the second month, in the second year after their departure from the land of Egypt, saying,
2  Take the sum of the whole assembly of the children of Israel, after their families, according to their fathers' houses, by the number of the names, every male, according to their polls;
3  from twenty years and upward, all that go forth to military service in Israel: ye shall number them according to their hosts, thou and Aaron.
4  And with you there shall be a man for every tribe, a man who is the head of his father's house.
5  And these are the names of the men that shall stand with you: for Reuben, Elizur the son of Shedeur;
6  for Simeon, Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai;
7  for Judah, Nahshon the son of Amminadab;
8  for Issachar, Nethaneel the son of Zuar;
9  for Zebulun, Eliab the son of Helon;

16  These were those summoned of the assembly, princes of the tribes of their fathers, the heads of the thousands of Israel.
17  And Moses and Aaron took these men who are expressed by their names,
18  and gathered the whole assembly together on the first of the second month. And they declared their pedigrees after their families, according to their fathers' houses, by the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, according to their polls.
19  As Jehovah had commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai.
20  And the sons of Reuben, Israel's eldest son, their generations, after their families, according to their fathers' houses, by the number of the names, according to their polls, every male from twenty years old and upward, all that went forth to military service:
21  those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Reuben, were forty-six thousand five hundred.
22  Of the sons of Simeon: their generations, after their families, according to their fathers' houses, those that were numbered of them, by the number of the names, according to their polls, every male from twenty years old and upward, all that went forth to military service:

27  those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Judah, were seventy-four thousand six hundred.
28  Of the sons of Issachar: their generations, after their families, according to their fathers' houses, by the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that went forth to military service:

43  those that were numbered of them, of the tribe of Naphtali, were fifty-three thousand four hundred.
44  These are those that were numbered, whom Moses and Aaron numbered, and the princes of Israel, the twelve men: each one was for the house of his fathers.
45  And all those that were numbered of the children of Israel, according to their fathers' houses, from twenty years old and upward, all that went forth to military service in Israel,
46  all they that were numbered were six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty.
47  But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them.
48  For Jehovah had spoken to Moses, saying,
49  Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel.
50  But thou, appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things that belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all its vessels; and they shall serve it, and round about the tabernacle shall they encamp;
51  and when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle encampeth, the Levites shall set it up; and the stranger that cometh near shall be put to death.
52  And the children of Israel shall encamp every man in his camp, and every man by his own standard, according to their hosts;
53  but the Levites shall encamp round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there come not wrath upon the assembly of the children of Israel; and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony.
54  And the children of Israel did so; according to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses, so did they.
{2}
1  And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
2  The children of Israel shall encamp every one by his standard, with the ensign of their father's house; round about the tent of meeting, afar off, opposite to it shall they encamp.
3  And [for] those encamping eastward toward the sun-rising [there shall be] the standard of the camp of Judah according to their hosts; and the prince of the sons of Judah shall be Nahshon the son of Amminadab;

15  and his host, even those that were numbered of them, forty-five thousand six hundred and fifty.
16  All that were numbered of the camp of Reuben were a hundred and fifty-one thousand four hundred and fifty, according to their hosts. And they shall set forth second.
17  And the tent of meeting shall set forth, the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camps; as they encamp, so shall they set forth, every man in his place, according to their standards.
18  The standard of the camp of Ephraim according to their hosts shall be westward; and the prince of the sons of Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud;
19  and his host, even those that were numbered of them, forty thousand five hundred.
20  And by him shall be the tribe of Manasseh; and the prince of the sons of Manasseh shall be Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur;
21  and his host, even those that were numbered of them, thirty-two thousand two hundred.
22  And [with them shall be] the tribe of Benjamin; and the prince of the sons of Benjamin shall be Abidan the son of Gideoni;
23  and his host, even those that were numbered of them, thirty-five thousand four hundred.
24  All that were numbered of the camp of Ephraim were a hundred and eight thousand one hundred, according to their hosts. And they shall set forth third.
25  The standard of the camp of Dan shall be northward according to their hosts; and the prince of the sons of Dan shall be Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai;

31  All that were numbered of the camp of Dan were a hundred and fifty-seven thousand six hundred. They shall set forth last according to their standards.
32  These are those that were numbered of the children of Israel, according to their fathers' houses: all those that were numbered of the camps, according to their hosts, were six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty.
33  But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel; as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
34  And the children of Israel did according to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses: so they encamped according to their standards, and so they journeyed, every one according to their families, according to their fathers' houses.
{3}
1  And these are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that Jehovah spoke with Moses on mount Sinai.
2  And these are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
3  These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the anointed priests, who were consecrated to exercise the priesthood.
4  And Nadab and Abihu died before Jehovah when they offered strange fire before Jehovah in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no sons; and Eleazar and Ithamar exercised the priesthood in the presence of Aaron their father.
5  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
6  Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister unto him;
7  and they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole assembly, before the tent of meeting, to do the service of the tabernacle.
8  And they shall keep all the utensils of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle.
9  And thou shalt give the Levites to Aaron and to his sons: they are wholly given to him out of the children of Israel.
10  And Aaron and his sons shalt thou appoint that they may attend to their priest's office; and the stranger that cometh near shall be put to death.
11  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
12  And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of every firstborn that breaketh open the womb among the children of Israel, and the Levites shall be mine;
13  for every firstborn is mine. On the day that I smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in Israel, both of man and beast; mine shall they be: I am Jehovah.
14  And Jehovah spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,
15  Number the sons of Levi according to their fathers' houses, after their families; every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them.
16  And Moses numbered them, according to the commandment of Jehovah, -- as he had been commanded.
17  And these are the sons of Levi by their names: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari.
18  And these are the names of the sons of Gershon according to their families: Libni and Shimei.
19  And the sons of Kohath according to their families: Amram and Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel.

22  Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, those that were numbered of them were seven thousand five hundred.
23  The families of the Gershonites encamped behind the tabernacle westward.
24  And the prince of the father's house of the Gershonites was Eliasaph the son of Lael.
25  And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting was: the tabernacle and the tent, its covering, and the curtain of the entrance to the tent of meeting.
26  And the hangings of the court, and the curtain of the entrance to the court, which surrounds the tabernacle and the altar, and the cords thereof for all its service.
27  And of Kohath, the family of the Amramites, and the family of the Izharites, and the family of the Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites: these are the families of the Kohathites.
28  According to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, there were eight thousand six hundred, who kept the charge of the sanctuary.
29  The families of the sons of Kohath encamped on the side of the tabernacle southward.
30  And the prince of the father's house of the families of the Kohathites was Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.
31  And their charge was the ark, and the table, and the candlestick, and the altars, and the utensils of the sanctuary with which they ministered, and the curtain, and all that belongs to its service.
32  And the prince of princes of the Levites was Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest: he had the oversight of them that kept the charge of the sanctuary.
33  Of Merari was the family of the Mahlites, and the family of the Mushites: these are the families of Merari.
34  And those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, were six thousand two hundred.
35  And the prince of the father's house of the families of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail. They encamped on the side of the tabernacle northward.
36  And the charge of the sons of Merari consisted in the oversight of the boards of the tabernacle, and its bars, and its pillars, and its bases, and all its furniture, and all that belongs to its service,
37  and the pillars of the court round about, and their bases, and their pegs, and their cords.
38  And those who encamped before the tabernacle eastward, before the tent of meeting toward the sunrising, were Moses, and Aaron and his sons, who kept the charge of the sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel; and the stranger that cometh near shall be put to death.
39  All that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of Jehovah, according to their families, all the males from a month old and upward, were twenty-two thousand.
40  And Jehovah said to Moses, Number all the first-born males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names.
41  And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am Jehovah) instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the cattle of the Levites, instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children of Israel.
42  And Moses numbered, as Jehovah had commanded him, all the firstborn among the children of Israel.
43  And all the firstborn males, by the number of the names, from a month old and upward, according to their numbering, were twenty-two thousand two hundred and seventy-three.
44  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
45  Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I am Jehovah.
46  And for those that are to be ransomed, the two hundred and seventy-three of the firstborn of the children of Israel, which are in excess over the Levites,
47  thou shalt take five shekels apiece by the poll, according to the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them, -- twenty gerahs the shekel;
48  and thou shalt give the money unto Aaron and unto his sons for those in excess among them who are to be ransomed.
49  And Moses took the ransom-money from them that were over and above those who were ransomed by the Levites;
50  of the firstborn of the children of Israel he took the money, a thousand three hundred and sixty-five [shekels], according to the shekel of the sanctuary.
51  And Moses gave the money of them that were ransomed to Aaron and to his sons, according to the commandment of Jehovah, -- as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
{4}
1  And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
2  Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, after their families, according to their fathers' houses,
3  from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, all that enter into the service, to do the work in the tent of meeting.
4  This shall be the service of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting: it is most holy.
5  And when the camp setteth forward, Aaron and his sons shall go in, and they shall take down the veil of separation and cover the ark of testimony with it;
6  and shall put thereon a covering of badgers' skin, and shall spread over it a cloth wholly of blue, and shall put its staves [to it].
7  And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue; and put thereon the dishes, and the cups, and the bowls, and goblets of the drink-offering; and the continual bread shall be thereon.
8  And they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover it with a covering of badgers' skin, and shall put its staves [to it].
9  And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick of the light, and its lamps, and its snuffers, and its snuff-trays, and all the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they perform its service;
10  and they shall put it and all the utensils thereof within a covering of badgers' skin, and shall put it upon a pole.
11  And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue, and cover it with a covering of badgers' skin, and shall put its staves [to it].
12  And they shall take all the instruments of service, wherewith they serve in the sanctuary, and put them in a cloth of blue, and cover them with a covering of badgers' skin, and shall put them upon a pole.
13  And they shall cleanse the altar of the ashes, and spread a purple cloth thereon;
14  and they shall put upon it all the utensils thereof, wherewith they perform service about it: the firepans, the forks, and the shovels, and the bowls, -- all the utensils of the altar; and they shall spread upon it a covering of badgers' skin, and put its staves [to it].
15  And when Aaron and his sons have ended covering the sanctuary, and all the utensils of the sanctuary, when the camp setteth forward, then afterwards the sons of Kohath shall come to carry it; but they shall not touch the holy things, lest they die. This is what the sons of Kohath have to carry in the tent of meeting.
16  And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall have the oversight of the oil for the light, and the fragrant incense, and the continual oblation, and the anointing oil, -- the oversight of the whole tabernacle, and of all that is therein, over the sanctuary, and over its furniture.
17  And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
18  Ye shall not cut off the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites,
19  but this shall ye do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they draw near unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden;
20  but they shall not go in and see for a moment the holy things, lest they die.
21  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
22  Take also the sum of the sons of Gershon, according to their fathers' houses, after their families.
23  From thirty years old and upward to fifty years old shalt thou number them; every one that cometh to labour in the work, to perform the service in the tent of meeting.
24  This shall be the service of the families of the Gershonites, in serving, and in carrying:
25  they shall carry the curtains of the tabernacle, and the tent of meeting, its covering, and the covering of badgers' skin that is above upon it, and the curtain of the entrance to the tent of meeting,
26  and the hangings of the court, and the curtain of the entrance, of the gate of the court, which surroundeth the tabernacle and the altar, and the cords thereof, and all the instruments of their service; and all that is to be done for these things shall they perform.
27  At the commandment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their carrying, and in all their service; and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their carrying.
28  This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting, and their charge shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
29  The sons of Merari: after their families, according to their fathers' houses shalt thou number them;
30  from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old shalt thou number them, every one that entereth into the labour, to perform the service of the tent of meeting.
31  And this shall be the charge of their burden, according to all their service in the tent of meeting: the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and bases thereof,
32  and the pillars of the court round about, and their bases, and their pegs, and their cords, all their instruments, according to all their service; and by name ye shall number to them the materials which are their charge to carry.
33  This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, according to all their service in the tent of meeting, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
34  And Moses and Aaron and the princes of the assembly numbered the sons of the Kohathites after their families, and according to their fathers' houses,
35  from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old, every one that entered into the labour, for service in the tent of meeting.
36  And those that were numbered of them according to their families were two thousand seven hundred and fifty.
37  These are they that were numbered of the families of the Kohathites, every one that served in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of Jehovah through Moses.

46  All those that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron and the princes of Israel numbered, after their families and according to their fathers' houses,

48  even those that were numbered of them, were eight thousand five hundred and eighty.
49  According to the commandment of Jehovah they were numbered by Moses, every one for his service, and for his burden, and numbered by him, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
{5}
1  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
2  Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is defiled by a dead person:
3  both male and female shall ye put out; outside the camp shall ye put them, that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell.
4  And the children of Israel did so, and put them outside the camp: as Jehovah had said to Moses, so did the children of Israel.
5  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
6  Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any of all the sins of man to work unfaithfulness against Jehovah, and that soul is guilty,
7  then they shall confess their sin which they have done; and he shall recompense his trespass according to the principal thereof, and shall add unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed.
8  And if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto, the trespass which is recompensed to Jehovah shall be the priest's, besides the ram of the atonement, wherewith an atonement is made for him.
9  And every heave-offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they present unto the priest, shall be his.
10  And every man's hallowed things shall be his: whatever any man giveth the priest shall be his.
11  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
12  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man's wife go astray, and commit unfaithfulness against him,
13  and a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and she be defiled in secret, and there be no witness against her, and she have not been caught;
14  and the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she have been defiled, -- or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she have not been defiled,
15  -- then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, a tenth part of an ephah of barley-meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is an oblation of jealousy, a memorial oblation, bringing iniquity to remembrance.
16  And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before Jehovah.
17  And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and the priest shall take of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle, and put it into the water.
18  And the priest shall set the woman before Jehovah, and uncover the woman's head, and put the memorial oblation in her hands, which is the jealousy offering; and in the hand of the priest shall be the bitter water that bringeth the curse.
19  And the priest shall adjure her, and say unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone astray in uncleanness, in being with another instead of thy husband, be free from this bitter water that bringeth the curse.
20  But if thou hast gone astray to another instead of thy husband, and hast been defiled, and a man other than thy husband have lain with thee,
21  -- then the priest shall adjure the woman with the oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman: Jehovah make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when Jehovah doth make thy thigh to shrink, and thy belly to swell;
22  and this water that bringeth the curse shall enter into thy bowels, to make the belly to swell, and the thigh to shrink. And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.
23  And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and shall blot them out with the bitter water,
24  and he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that bringeth the curse, that the water that bringeth the curse may enter into her for bitterness.
25  And the priest shall take out of the woman's hand the oblation of jealousy, and shall wave the oblation before Jehovah, and shall present it at the altar.
26  And the priest shall take a handful of the oblation as a memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar; and afterwards he shall make the woman drink the water.
27  And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, if she have been defiled, and have committed unfaithfulness against her husband, that the water that bringeth the curse shall enter into her, for bitterness, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall shrink; and the woman shall become a curse among her people.
28  But if the woman have not been defiled, and be clean, then she shall be clear, and shall conceive seed.
29  This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth astray to another instead of her husband and is defiled,
30  or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon a man, and he is jealous as regards his wife; then shall he set the woman before Jehovah, and the priest shall do to her according to all this law.
31  Then shall the man be free from iniquity, but that woman shall bear her iniquity.
{6}
1  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
2  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If a man or a woman have vowed the special vow of a Nazarite, to consecrate themselves to Jehovah;
3  he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink: he shall drink no vinegar of wine, nor vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat grapes, fresh or dried.
4  All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine, from the seed-stones, even to the skin.
5  All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head; until the days be fulfilled, that he hath consecrated himself to Jehovah, he shall be holy; he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.
6  All the days that he hath consecrated himself to Jehovah, he shall come near no dead body.
7  He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister when they die; for the consecration of his God is upon his head.
8  All the days of his separation he is holy to Jehovah.
9  And if any one die unexpectedly by him suddenly, and he hath defiled the head of his consecration, then he shall shave his head on the day of his cleansing; on the seventh day shall he shave it.
10  And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, to the priest, at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
11  And the priest shall offer one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, and make an atonement for him, for that he sinned by the dead person; and he shall hallow his head that same day.
12  And he shall [again] consecrate to Jehovah the days of his separation, and shall bring a yearling lamb for a trespass-offering. But the first days are forfeited, for his consecration hath been defiled.
13  And this is the law of the Nazarite on the day when the days of his consecration are fulfilled: he shall be brought to the entrance of the tent of meeting.
14  And he shall present his offering to Jehovah, one yearling he-lamb without blemish for a burnt-offering, and one yearling ewe-lamb without blemish for a sin-offering, and one ram without blemish for a peace-offering;
15  and a basket with unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their oblation, and their drink-offerings.
16  And the priest shall present them before Jehovah, and shall offer his sin-offering and his burnt-offering:
17  and he shall offer the ram, a sacrifice of peace-offering to Jehovah, with the basket of unleavened bread; the priest shall offer also his oblation and his drink-offering.
18  And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his consecration at the entrance to the tent of meeting, and shall take the hair of the head of his consecration, and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace-offering.
19  And the priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazarite, after he hath shaven [the hair of] his consecration.
20  And the priest shall wave them as wave-offering before Jehovah; it is holy for the priest, with the breast of the wave-offering and with the shoulder of the heave-offering; and afterwards the Nazarite may drink wine.
21  This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed: his offering to Jehovah for his consecration, beside what his hand is able to get; according to the vow which he vowed, so shall he do, according to the law of his consecration.
22  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
23  Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel: saying unto them,
24  Jehovah bless thee, and keep thee;
25  Jehovah make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee;
26  Jehovah lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.
27  And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel; and I will bless them.

1  And it came to pass on the day that Moses had completed the setting up of the tabernacle, and had anointed it, and hallowed it, and all the furniture thereof, and the altar and all its utensils, and had anointed them, and hallowed them,
2  that the princes of Israel, the heads of their fathers' houses, the princes of the tribes, they that were over them that had been numbered, offered;
3  and they brought their offering before Jehovah, six covered waggons, and twelve oxen; a waggon for two princes, and an ox for each; and they presented them before the tabernacle.
4  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
5  Take it of them, and they shall be for the performance of the service of the tent of meeting, and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to each according to his service.
6  And Moses took the waggons and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites.
7  Two waggons and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon, according to their service;
8  and four waggons and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari, according to their service, -- under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
9  But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none, for the service of the sanctuary was upon them: they bore [what they carried] upon the shoulder.

89  And when Moses went into the tent of meeting to speak with Him, then he heard the voice speaking to him from off the mercy-seat which was upon the ark of testimony, from between the two cherubim; and he spoke to Him.
{8}
1  And Jehovah spoke to Moses saying,
2  Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick.
3  And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the candlestick, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
4  And this was the work of the candlestick: [it was] of beaten gold; from its base to its flowers was it beaten work; according to the form which Jehovah had shewn Moses, so had he made the candlestick.
5  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
6  Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them.
7  And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: sprinkle upon them water of purification from sin; and they shall pass the razor over all their flesh, and shall wash their garments, and make themselves clean.
8  And they shall take a young bullock and its oblation of fine flour mingled with oil; and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin-offering.
9  And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tent of meeting; and thou shalt gather together the whole assembly of the children of Israel.
10  And thou shalt bring the Levites before Jehovah; and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites.
11  And Aaron shall offer the Levites as a wave-offering before Jehovah from the children of Israel, and they shall perform the service of Jehovah.
12  And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks, and thou shalt offer the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, to Jehovah, to make atonement for the Levites.
13  And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them as a wave-offering to Jehovah.
14  And thou shalt separate the Levites from among the children of Israel, that the Levites may be mine.
15  And afterwards shall the Levites come in to do the service of the tent of meeting. And thou shalt cleanse them, and offer them as a wave-offering.
16  For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel; instead of every one that breaketh open the womb, instead of every firstborn among the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me.
17  For all the firstborn among the children of Israel are mine, both of man and beast; on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt, I hallowed them to myself.
18  And I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel.
19  And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons, from among the children of Israel, to perform the service of the children of Israel in the tent of meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel; that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel draw near to the sanctuary.
20  And Moses and Aaron, and all the assembly of the children of Israel, did to the Levites according to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses concerning the Levites: so did the children of Israel to them.
21  And the Levites purified themselves from sin, and they washed their garments; and Aaron offered them as a wave-offering before Jehovah; and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them.
22  And afterwards the Levites came in to perform their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron, and before his sons; as Jehovah had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they to them.
23  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
24  This is that which concerneth the Levites: from twenty-five years old and upward shall he come to labour in the work of the service of the tent of meeting.
25  And from fifty years old he shall retire from the labour of the service, and shall serve no more;
26  but he shall minister with his brethren in the tent of meeting, and keep the charge, but he shall not serve [in] the service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites with regard to their charges.
{9}
1  And Jehovah spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after their departure from the land of Egypt, saying,
2  Let the children of Israel also hold the passover at its set time;
3  on the fourteenth day in this month between the two evenings, ye shall hold it at its set time; according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ordinances thereof shall ye hold it.
4  And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, that they should hold the passover.
5  And they held the passover in the first [month] on the fourteenth day of the month, between the two evenings, in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.
6  And there were men, who were unclean through the dead body of a man, and could not hold the passover on that day; and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day.
7  And those men said to him, We are unclean by reason of the dead body of a man: why are we kept back, that we may not present the offering of Jehovah at its set time among the children of Israel?
8  And Moses said to them, Stay, and I will hear what Jehovah commands concerning you.
9  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
10  Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any one of you or of your generations be unclean by reason of a dead body or be on a journey afar off, yet he shall hold the passover to Jehovah.
11  In the second month, on the fourteenth day, between the two evenings, shall they hold it; with unleavened bread and bitter herbs shall they eat it.
12  They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break a bone thereof: according to every ordinance of the passover shall they hold it.
13  But a man that is clean, and is not on a journey, and forbeareth to hold the passover, that soul shall be cut off from among his peoples; because he presented not the offering of Jehovah at its set time: that man shall bear his sin.
14  And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and would hold the passover to Jehovah, according to the rite of the passover, and according to the ordinance thereof, so shall he do. Ye shall have one rite, both for the stranger and for him that is born in the land.
15  And on the day that the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle of the tent of testimony; and at even it was upon the tabernacle as the appearance of fire, until the morning.
16  So it was continually: the cloud covered it, and at night it was as the appearance of fire.
17  And when the cloud rose from the tent, then the children of Israel journeyed; and at the place where the cloud stood still, there the children of Israel encamped.
18  According to the commandment of Jehovah the children of Israel journeyed, and according to the commandment of Jehovah they [remained] encamped; all the days that the cloud dwelt upon the tabernacle they encamped.
19  And when the cloud was long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of Jehovah, and journeyed not.
20  And if it were so that the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle, according to the commandment of Jehovah they encamped, and according to the commandment of Jehovah they journeyed.
21  And if it were so that the cloud was there from the evening until the morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed; or a day and a night, and the cloud was taken up, they journeyed;
22  or two days, or a month, or many days, when the cloud was long upon the tabernacle, dwelling upon it, the children of Israel [remained] encamped, and journeyed not; but when it was taken up, they journeyed.
23  At the commandment of Jehovah they encamped, and at the commandment of Jehovah they journeyed: they kept the charge of Jehovah according to the commandment of Jehovah through Moses.
{10}
1  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
2  Make thee two trumpets of silver; of beaten work shalt thou make them; and they shall serve for the calling together of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.
3  And when they shall blow with them, the whole assembly shall gather to thee at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
4  And if they blow with one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather unto thee.
5  And when ye blow an alarm, the camps that lie eastward shall set forward.
6  And when ye blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie southward shall set forward; they shall blow an alarm on their setting forward.
7  And when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not blow an alarm:
8  the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an everlasting statute throughout your generations.
9  And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before Jehovah your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.
10  And in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in your new moons, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt-offerings and over your sacrifices of peace-offering; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God: I am Jehovah your God.
11  And it came to pass in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth of the month, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony.
12  And the children of Israel set forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud stood still in the wilderness of Paran.
13  And they first took their journey, according to the commandment of Jehovah through Moses.
14  The standard of the camp of the children of Judah set forward first according to their hosts, and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab;
15  and over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethaneel the son of Zuar;
16  and over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.
17  And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward bearing the tabernacle.
18  And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their hosts, and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur;
19  and over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai;
20  and over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.
21  And the Kohathites set forward bearing the sanctuary: and [the others] set up the tabernacle whilst they came.
22  And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their hosts, and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud;
23  and over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur;
24  and over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.
25  And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward, the rear-guard of all the camps according to their hosts, and over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai;
26  and over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran;
27  and over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.
28  These were the settings forward of the children of Israel according to their hosts: so did they set forward.
29  And Moses said to Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, We are journeying to the place of which Jehovah said, I will give it unto you: come with us, and we will do thee good; for Jehovah has spoken good concerning Israel.
30  And he said to him, I will not go; but to mine own land, and to my kindred will I go.
31  And he said, Leave me not, I pray thee, because thou knowest where we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou wilt be to us for eyes.
32  And it shall be, if thou come with us, that whatever good Jehovah doeth unto us, so will we do to thee.
33  And they set forward from the mountain of Jehovah [and went] three days' journey; and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went before them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting-place for them.
34  And the cloud of Jehovah was over them by day when they set forward out of the camp.
35  And it came to pass when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, Jehovah, and let thine enemies be scattered; And let them that hate thee flee before thy face.
36  And when it rested, he said, Return, Jehovah, unto the myriads of the thousands of Israel.
{11}
1  And it came to pass that when the people murmured, it was evil in the ears of Jehovah; and Jehovah heard it, and his anger was kindled, and the fire of Jehovah burned among them, and consumed [some] in the extremity of the camp.
2  And the people cried to Moses; and Moses prayed to Jehovah -- and the fire abated.
3  And they called the name of that place Taberah; because a fire of Jehovah burned among them.
4  And the mixed multitude that was among them lusted; and the children of Israel also wept again and said, Who will give us flesh to eat?
5  We remember the fish that we ate in Egypt for nothing; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic;
6  and now our soul is dried up: there is nothing at all but the manna before our eyes.
7  And the manna was as coriander seed, and its appearance as the appearance of bdellium.
8  The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it with hand-mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it; and the taste of it was as the taste of oil-cakes.
9  And when the dew fell upon the camp by night, the manna fell upon it.
10  And Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every one at the entrance of his tent; and the anger of Jehovah was kindled greatly; it was also evil in the eyes of Moses.
11  And Moses said to Jehovah, Why hast thou done evil to thy servant, and why have I not found favour in thine eyes, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?
12  Have I conceived all this people, have I brought them forth, that thou sayest to me, Carry them in thy bosom, as the nursing-father beareth the suckling, unto the land which thou didst swear unto their fathers?
13  Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh that we may eat!
14  I am not able to bear all this people alone, for it is too heavy for me.
15  And if thou deal thus with me, slay me, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, that I may not behold my wretchedness.
16  And Jehovah said to Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and their officers; and take them to the tent of meeting, and they shall stand there with thee.
17  And I will come down and talk with thee there; and I will take of the Spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, and thou shalt not bear it alone.
18  And unto the people shalt thou say, Hallow yourselves for to-morrow, and ye shall eat flesh; for ye have wept in the ears of Jehovah, saying, Who will give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt; and Jehovah will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.
19  Not one day shall ye eat, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;
20  [but] for a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it become loathsome unto you; because that ye have despised Jehovah who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?
21  And Moses said, The people in whose midst I am are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou sayest, I will give them flesh that they may eat a whole month.
22  Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered for them, to suffice them?
23  And Jehovah said to Moses, Hath Jehovah's hand become short? Now shalt thou see whether my word will come to pass unto thee or not.
24  And Moses went out and told the people the words of Jehovah; and he gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tent.
25  And Jehovah came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy men, the elders; and it came to pass, that when the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but they did not repeat [it].
26  And two men remained in the camp, the name of the one, Eldad, and the name of the other, Medad; and the Spirit rested upon them (and they were among them that were written, but they had not gone out to the tent); and they prophesied in the camp.
27  And there ran a youth, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.
28  And Joshua the son of Nun, the attendant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them!
29  But Moses said to him, Enviest thou for my sake? would that all Jehovah's people were prophets, [and] that Jehovah would put his Spirit upon them!
30  And Moses withdrew into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.
31  And there went forth a wind from Jehovah, and drove quails from the sea, and cast them about the camp, about a day's journey on this side, and about a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the earth.
32  And the people rose up all that day, and the whole night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered little gathered ten homers; and they spread them abroad for themselves round about the camp.
33  The flesh was yet between their teeth, before it was chewed, when the wrath of Jehovah was kindled against the people, and Jehovah smote the people with a very great plague.
34  And they called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah; because there they buried the people who lusted.
35  From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth; and they were at Hazeroth.
{12}
1  And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had taken; for he had taken a Cushite as wife.
2  And they said, Has Jehovah indeed spoken only to Moses? has he not spoken also to us? And Jehovah heard it.
3  But the man Moses was very meek, above all men that were upon the face of the earth.
4  Then Jehovah spoke suddenly to Moses, and to Aaron, and to Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tent of meeting. And they went out, they three.
5  And Jehovah came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood at the entrance of the tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forth.
6  And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I Jehovah will make myself known to him in a vision, I will speak to him in a dream.
7  Not so my servant Moses: he is faithful in all my house.
8  Mouth to mouth do I speak to him openly, and not in riddles; and the form of Jehovah doth he behold. Why then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?
9  And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against them, and he went away;
10  and the cloud departed from off the tent. And behold, Miriam was leprous as snow; and Aaron turned toward Miriam, and behold, she was leprous.
11  Then Aaron said to Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not this sin upon us, wherein we have been foolish, and have sinned!
12  Let her not be as one stillborn, half of whose flesh is consumed when he comes out of his mother's womb.
13  And Moses cried to Jehovah, saying, O God, heal her, I beseech thee!
14  And Jehovah said to Moses, But had her father anyways spat in her face, should she not be shamed seven days? She shall be shut outside the camp seven days, and afterwards she shall be received in [again].
15  And Miriam was shut outside the camp seven days; and the people did not journey till Miriam was received in [again].
16  And afterwards the people journeyed from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.
{13}
1  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
2  Send thou men, that they may search out the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel. Ye shall send a man of every tribe of his fathers, each a prince among them.
3  And Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran: according to the commandment of Jehovah, all of them heads of the children of Israel.
4  And these are their names: for the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur;
5  for the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori;
6  for the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;
7  for the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph;
8  for the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun;
9  for the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu;
10  for the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi;
11  for the tribe of Joseph, for the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi;
12  for the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli;
13  for the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael;
14  for the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi;
15  for the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
16  These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to search out the land. And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun, Jehoshua.
17  And Moses sent them to search out the land of Canaan, and said to them, Go up this way by the south and go up into the hill-country,
18  and ye shall see the land, what it is; and the people that dwell in it, whether they are strong or weak, few or many;
19  and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds;
20  and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether there are trees in it, or not. And take courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first grapes.
21  And they went up, and searched out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, where one comes towards Hamath.
22  And they went up by the south, and came to Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there. Now Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.
23  And they came as far as the valley of Eshcol, and cut down thence a branch with one bunch of grapes, and they bore it between two upon a pole; and [they brought] of the pomegranates, and of the figs.
24  That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the grapes which the children of Israel had cut down there.
25  And they returned from searching out the land after forty days.
26  And they came, and went to Moses and to Aaron, and to the whole assembly of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them, and to the whole assembly; and shewed them the fruit of the land.
27  And they told him, and said, We came to the land to which thou didst send us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.
28  Only, the people are strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled, very great; moreover we saw the children of Anak there.
29  Amalek dwells in the land of the south; and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the hill-country; and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the side of the Jordan.
30  And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up boldly and possess it, for we are well able to do it.
31  But the men that went up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we.
32  And they brought to the children of Israel an evil report of the land which they had searched out, saying, The land, which we have passed through to search it out, is a land that eateth up its inhabitants; and all the people that we have seen in it are men of great stature;
33  and there have we seen giants -- the sons of Anak are of the giants -- and we were in our sight as grasshoppers, and so we were also in their sight.
{14}
1  And the whole assembly lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.
2  And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron; and the whole assembly said to them, Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! or in this wilderness would that we had died!
3  And why is Jehovah bringing us to this land that we may fall by the sword, that our wives and our little ones may become a prey? Is it not better for us to return to Egypt?
4  And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return to Egypt.
5  Then Moses and Aaron fell upon their faces before the whole congregation of the assembly of the children of Israel.
6  And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, of them that searched out the land, rent their garments.
7  And they spoke to the whole assembly of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it out, is a very, very good land.
8  If Jehovah delight in us, he will bring us into this land, and give it us, a land that flows with milk and honey;
9  only rebel not against Jehovah; and fear not the people of the land; for they shall be our food. Their defence is departed from them, and Jehovah is with us: fear them not.
10  And the whole assembly said that they should be stoned with stones. And the glory of Jehovah appeared in the tent of meeting to all the children of Israel.
11  And Jehovah said to Moses, How long will this people despise me? and how long will they not believe me, for all the signs which I have done among them?
12  I will smite them with the pestilence, and destroy them, and will make of thee a nation greater and mightier than they.
13  And Moses said to Jehovah, Then the Egyptians will hear it; for in thy might thou broughtest up this people from the midst of them;
14  and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land, [who] have heard that thou, Jehovah, art in the midst of this people, that thou, Jehovah, lettest thyself be seen eye to eye, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night;
15  if thou now slayest this people as one man, then the nations that have heard thy fame will speak, saying,
16  Because Jehovah was not able to bring this people into the land that he had sworn unto them, he has therefore slain them in the wilderness.
17  And now, I beseech thee, let the power of the Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,
18  Jehovah is slow to anger, and abundant in goodness, forgiving iniquity and transgression, but by no means clearing [the guilty], visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and fourth [generation].
19  Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of thy loving-kindness, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.
20  And Jehovah said, I have pardoned according to thy word.
21  But as surely as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of Jehovah!
22  for all those men who have seen my glory, and my signs, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice,
23  shall in no wise see the land which I did swear unto their fathers: none of them that despised me shall see it.
24  But my servant Caleb, because he hath another spirit in him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he came; and his seed shall possess it.
25  (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwell in the valley.) To-morrow turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness, on the way to the Red sea.
26  And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
27  How long [shall I bear] with this evil assembly, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.
28  Say unto them, As surely as I live, saith Jehovah, if I do not do unto you as ye have spoken in mine ears!
29  In this wilderness shall your carcases fall; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number from twenty years old and upwards, who have murmured against me,
30  shall in no wise come into the land, concerning which I have lifted up my hand to make you dwell in it; save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
31  But your little ones, of whom ye said they should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land that ye have despised.
32  And as to you, your carcases shall fall in this wilderness.
33  And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness.
34  After the number of the days in which ye have searched out the land, forty days, each day for a year shall ye bear your iniquities forty years, and ye shall know mine estrangement [from you].
35  I Jehovah have spoken; I will surely do it unto all this evil assembly which have gathered together against me! in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.
36  And the men whom Moses had sent to search out the land, who returned, and made the whole assembly to murmur against him, by bringing up an evil report upon the land,
37  even those men who had brought up an evil report upon the land, died by a plague before Jehovah.
38  But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, lived still of the men that had gone to search out the land.
39  And Moses told all these sayings to all the children of Israel; then the people mourned greatly.
40  And they rose up early in the morning, and went up to the hill-top, saying, Here are we, and we will go up to the place of which Jehovah has spoken; for we have sinned.
41  And Moses said, Why now do ye transgress the commandment of Jehovah? but it shall not prosper!
42  Go not up, for Jehovah is not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies;
43  for the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword; for as ye have turned away from Jehovah, Jehovah will not be with you.
44  Yet they presumed to go up to the hill-top; but the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and Moses, did not depart from the midst of the camp.
45  And the Amalekites and the Canaanites who dwelt on that hill, came down and smote them, and cut them to pieces, as far as Hormah.
{15}
1  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
2  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land of your dwellings, which I give unto you,
3  and will make an offering by fire to Jehovah, a burnt-offering or a sacrifice for the performance of a vow, or as a voluntary offering, or in your set feasts, to make a sweet odour to Jehovah, of the herd or of the flock,
4  then shall he that presenteth his offering to Jehovah bring as oblation a tenth part of fine flour mingled with a fourth part of a hin of oil;
5  and of wine for a drink-offering shalt thou offer the fourth part of a hin with the burnt-offering, or with the sacrifice, for one lamb.
6  And for a ram thou shalt offer as oblation two tenth parts of fine flour mingled with oil, a third part of a hin,
7  and of wine for a drink-offering shalt thou offer the third part of a hin; for a sweet odour to Jehovah.
8  And when thou offerest a bullock for a burnt-offering, or a sacrifice for the performance of a vow, or for a peace-offering to Jehovah,
9  then shall they present with the bullock as oblation three tenth parts of fine flour mingled with half a hin of oil;
10  and of wine shalt thou present half a hin, for a drink-offering, as an offering by fire, of a sweet odour to Jehovah.
11  Thus shall it be done for one ox, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or for a kid;
12  according to the number that ye offer, so shall ye do to every one according to their number.
13  And all that are born in the land shall do these things thus, in presenting an offering by fire of a sweet odour to Jehovah.
14  And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whoever be among you throughout your generations, and will offer an offering by fire of a sweet odour to Jehovah, -- as ye do, so shall he do.
15  As to the congregation, there shall be one statute for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an everlasting statute throughout your generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger be, before Jehovah.
16  One law and one ordinance shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you.
17  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
18  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you,
19  then it shall be, when ye eat of the bread of the land, that ye shall offer a heave-offering to Jehovah;
20  the first of your dough shall ye offer, a cake, for a heave-offering; as the heave-offering of the threshing-floor, so shall ye offer this.
21  Of the first of your dough ye shall give to Jehovah a heave-offering throughout your generations.
22  And if ye sin inadvertently, and do not all these commandments, which Jehovah hath spoken unto Moses,
23  all that Jehovah hath commanded you through Moses, from the day that Jehovah gave commandment, and henceforward throughout your generations;
24  then it shall be, if ought be committed by inadvertence [hid] from the eyes of the assembly, that the whole assembly shall offer one young bullock for a burnt-offering, for a sweet odour to Jehovah, and its oblation and its drink-offering according to the ordinance, and one buck of the goats for a sin-offering.
25  And the priest shall make atonement for the whole assembly of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it was a sin of inadvertence, and they have brought before Jehovah their offering, as an offering by fire to Jehovah, and their sin-offering for their [sin of] inadvertence;
26  and it shall be forgiven the whole assembly of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; for with all the people there was [a sin of] inadvertence.
27  And if one soul sin through inadvertence, then he shall present a yearling she-goat for a sin-offering.
28  And the priest shall make atonement for the soul that hath done inadvertently, when he sinneth by inadvertence before Jehovah, to make atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.
29  For him that is born in the land among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them -- there shall be one law for you, for him who doeth anything through inadvertence.
30  But the soul that doeth ought with a high hand, whether born in the land, or a stranger, he reproacheth Jehovah; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
31  For he hath despised the word of Jehovah, and hath broken his commandment: that soul shall surely be cut off; his iniquity is upon him.
32  And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness they found a man gathering sticks on the sabbath day.
33  And they that found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to the whole assembly.
34  And they put him in custody, for it was not declared what should be done to him.
35  And Jehovah said to Moses, The man shall certainly be put to death: the whole assembly shall stone him with stones outside the camp.
36  And the whole assembly led him outside the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
37  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
38  Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them tassels on the corners of their garments, throughout their generations, and that they attach to the tassel of the corners a lace of blue;
39  and it shall be unto you for a tassel, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of Jehovah, and do them; and that ye seek not after [the lusts of] your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye go a whoring;
40  that ye may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.
41  I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God: I am Jehovah your God.
{16}
1  And Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, made bold, and [with him] Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, the sons of Reuben;
2  and they rose up against Moses, with two hundred and fifty men of the children of Israel, princes of the assembly, summoned to the council, men of renown;
3  and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, It is enough; for all the assembly, all of them are holy, and Jehovah is among them; and why do ye lift up yourselves above the congregation of Jehovah?
4  When Moses heard this, he fell on his face.
5  And he spoke to Korah and to all his band, saying, Even to-morrow will Jehovah make known who is his, and who is holy; and he will cause him to come near to him; and him whom he has chosen, him will he cause to come near to him.
6  This do: take you censers, Korah, and all his band,
7  and put fire therein, and lay incense thereon before Jehovah to-morrow; and it shall be that the man whom Jehovah doth choose, he shall be holy. It is enough, ye sons of Levi!
8  And Moses said to Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi!
9  Is it too little for you, that the God of Israel has separated you from the assembly of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the work of the tabernacle of Jehovah, and to stand before the assembly to minister to them?
10  -- that he has brought thee near, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee; and seek ye now the priesthood also?
11  For which cause thou and all thy band are banded together against Jehovah; and Aaron, who is he that ye murmur against him?
12  And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; but they said, We will not come up!
13  Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, that thou must make thyself altogether a ruler over us?
14  Moreover, thou hast not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up!
15  Then Moses was very wroth, and said to Jehovah, Have no regard to their oblation: not one ass have I taken from them, neither have I hurt one of them.
16  And Moses said to Korah, Be thou and all thy band before Jehovah, thou, and they, and Aaron, to-morrow.
17  And take each his censer, and put incense thereon, and present before Jehovah every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; and thou, and Aaron, each his censer.
18  And they took each his censer, and put fire on them, and laid incense thereon, and stood before the entrance to the tent of meeting, as well as Moses and Aaron.
19  And Korah gathered the whole assembly against them to the entrance of the tent of meeting. And the glory of Jehovah appeared to all the assembly.
20  And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
21  Separate yourselves from the midst of this assembly, and I will consume them in a moment.
22  And they fell on their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh! shall *one* man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with the whole assembly?
23  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
24  Speak unto the assembly, saying, Get you up from about the habitation of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
25  And Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.
26  And he spoke to the assembly, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye perish in all their sins.
27  And they got up from the habitation of Koran, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side. And Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the entrance of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little ones.
28  And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that Jehovah has sent me to do all these deeds, for they are not out of my own heart:
29  if these men die as all men die, and are visited with the visitation of all men, Jehovah has not sent me;
30  but if Jehovah make a new thing, and the ground open its mouth, and swallow them up, and all that they have, and they go down alive into Sheol, then ye shall know that these men have despised Jehovah.
31  And it came to pass when he had ended speaking all these words, that the ground clave apart that was under them.
32  And the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men that belonged to Korah, and all their property.
33  And they went down, they and all that they had, alive into Sheol, and the earth covered them; and they perished from among the congregation.
34  And all Israel that were round about them fled at their cry; for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up!
35  And there came out a fire from Jehovah, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that had presented incense.
36  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
37  Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning; and scatter the fire afar; for they are hallowed,
38  the censers of these sinners who have forfeited their life; and they shall make them into broad plates for the covering of the altar; for they presented them before Jehovah, therefore they are hallowed; and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.
39  And Eleazar the priest took the copper censers, which they that were burnt had presented; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar:
40  as a memorial to the children of Israel, that no stranger who is not of the seed of Aaron come near to burn incense before Jehovah, that he be not as Korah, and as his band, -- as Jehovah had said to him through Moses.
41  And the whole assembly of the children of Israel murmured on the morrow against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of Jehovah.
42  And it came to pass, when the assembly was gathered together against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tent of meeting, and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Jehovah appeared.
43  And Moses and Aaron went before the tent of meeting.
44  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
45  Get you up from the midst of this assembly, and I will consume them in a moment. And they fell on their faces.
46  And Moses said to Aaron, Take the censer, and put fire thereon from off the altar, and lay on incense, and carry it quickly to the assembly, and make atonement for them; for there is wrath gone out from Jehovah: the plague is begun.
47  And Aaron took as Moses had said, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and behold, the plague had begun among the people; and he put on incense, and made atonement for the people.
48  And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.
49  Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred, besides them that had died because of the matter of Korah.
50  And Aaron returned to Moses to the entrance of the tent of meeting; and the plague was stayed.
{17}
1  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
2  Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of them a staff, a staff for each father's house, of all their princes according to the houses of their fathers, twelve staves: thou shalt write each one's name upon his staff.
3  And Aaron's name shalt thou write upon the staff of Levi; for one staff shall be for [each] head of their fathers' houses.
4  And thou shalt lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you.
5  And it shall come to pass, that the man whom I shall choose, his staff shall bud forth; and I will make to cease from before me the murmurings of the children of Israel, that they murmur against you.
6  And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and all their princes gave him a staff, one staff for each prince according to their fathers' houses, twelve staves, and the staff of Aaron was among their staves.
7  And Moses laid the staves before Jehovah in the tent of the testimony.
8  And it came to pass, when on the morrow Moses went into the tent of the testimony, behold, the staff of Aaron for the house of Levi had budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and ripened almonds.
9  And Moses brought out all the staves from before Jehovah to all the children of Israel, and they looked and took each one his staff.
10  And Jehovah said to Moses, Bring Aaron's staff again before the testimony, to be kept as a token for the sons of rebellion, that thou mayest put an end to their murmurings before me, that they may not die.
11  And Moses did so: as Jehovah had commanded him, so did he.
12  And the children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Lo, we expire, we perish, we all perish.
13  Every one that comes at all near to the tabernacle of Jehovah shall die: shall we then expire altogether?
{18}
1  And Jehovah said to Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary; and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.
2  And thy brethren also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring near with thee, that they may unite with thee, and minister unto thee; but thou and thy sons with thee [shall serve] before the tent of the testimony.
3  And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of the whole tent: only they shall not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary and to the altar, that they may not die, and you as well as they.
4  And they shall unite with thee, and keep the charge of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the tent; and no stranger shall come near to you.
5  And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar; that there come no wrath any more upon the children of Israel.
6  And I, behold, I have taken your brethren, the Levites, from among the children of Israel; to you are they given as a gift for Jehovah to perform the service of the tent of meeting.
7  But thou and thy sons with thee shall attend to your priesthood for all that concerneth the altar, and for that which is inside the veil; and ye shall perform the service: I give you your priesthood as a service of gift, and the stranger that cometh near shall be put to death.
8  And Jehovah spoke to Aaron, And I, behold, I have given thee the charge of my heave-offerings, of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; to thee have I given them, because of the anointing, and to thy sons by an everlasting statute.
9  This shall be thine of the most holy things, [reserved] from the fire: every offering of theirs, of all their oblations, and of all their sin-offerings, and of all their trespass-offerings, which they render unto me, it is most holy for thee and for thy sons.
10  As most holy shalt thou eat it: every male shall eat it; it shall be holy unto thee.
11  And this shall be thine: the heave-offering of their gift, with all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel; I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by an everlasting statute; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.
12  All the best of the oil, and all the best of the new wine, and of the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they give to Jehovah, have I given thee.
13  The first ripe of everything that is in their land, which they shall bring to Jehovah, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.
14  Every devoted thing in Israel shall be thine.
15  Everything that breaketh open the womb of all flesh, which they present to Jehovah, of men or of beasts, shall be thine; nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou in any case ransom, and the firstborn of unclean beasts shalt thou ransom.
16  And those that are to be ransomed from a month old shalt thou ransom, according to thy valuation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.
17  But the firstborn of a cow, or the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat, thou shalt not ransom: they are holy. Thou shalt sprinkle their blood on the altar, and their fat shalt thou burn as an offering by fire for a sweet odour to Jehovah.
18  And their flesh shall be thine; as the wave-breast and as the right shoulder shall it be thine.
19  All the heave-offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer to Jehovah, have I given thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by an everlasting statute: it shall be an everlasting covenant of salt before Jehovah unto thee and thy seed with thee.
20  And Jehovah said to Aaron, In their land thou shalt have no inheritance, neither shalt thou have any portion among them: I am thy portion and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.
21  And to the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithes in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they perform, the service of the tent of meeting.
22  Neither shall the children of Israel henceforth come near the tent of meeting, to bear sin and die.
23  But the Levite, he shall perform the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity: it is an everlasting statute throughout your generations. And among the children of Israel shall they possess no inheritance;
24  for I have given for an inheritance to the Levites the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as a heave-offering to Jehovah; therefore I have said of them, They shall possess no inheritance among the children of Israel.
25  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
26  And to the Levites shalt thou speak, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer a heave-offering from it for Jehovah, the tenth of the tithe.
27  And your heave-offering shall be reckoned unto you, as the corn from the threshing-floor, and as the fulness of the winepress.
28  Thus ye also shall offer Jehovah's heave-offering of all your tithes, which ye take of the children of Israel; and ye shall give thereof Jehovah's heave-offering to Aaron the priest.
29  Out of all that is given you ye shall offer the whole heave-offering of Jehovah, -- of all the best thereof the hallowed part thereof.
30  And thou shalt say unto them, When ye heave the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as produce of the threshing-floor, and as produce of the winepress.
31  And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households; for it is your reward for your service in the tent of meeting.
32  And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, if ye heave from it the best of it; and ye shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die.
{19}
1  And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
2  This is the statute of the law which Jehovah hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without blemish, wherein is no defect, and upon which never came yoke;
3  and ye shall give it to Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring it outside the camp, and one shall slaughter it before him.
4  And Eleazar the priest shall take of its blood with his finger, and shall sprinkle of its blood directly before the tent of meeting seven times.
5  And one shall burn the heifer before his eyes; its skin and its flesh, and its blood, with its dung, shall he burn.
6  And the priest shall take cedar-wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast them into the midst of the burning of the heifer.
7  And the priest shall wash his garments, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterwards he shall come into the camp; and the priest shall be unclean until the even;
8  and he that hath burned it shall wash his garments in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.
9  And a clean man shall gather the ashes of the heifer, and deposit them outside the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the assembly of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for sin.
10  And he that hath gathered the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even. And it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, an everlasting statute.
11  He that toucheth a dead person, any dead body of a man, shall be unclean seven days.
12  He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean; but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.
13  Whoever toucheth a dead person, the dead body of a man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of Jehovah; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel; for the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him: he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him.
14  This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: every one that cometh into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.
15  And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, shall be unclean.
16  And every one that toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead person, or the bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.
17  And they shall take for the unclean of the ashes of the purification-offering that hath been burned, and shall put running water thereon in a vessel;
18  and a clean man shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it on the tent, and upon all the utensils, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that hath touched the bone, or the one slain, or the dead person, or the grave;
19  and the clean shall sprinkle it on the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day; and he shall purify him on the seventh day; and he shall wash his garments, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even.
20  And the man that is unclean, and doth not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the congregation, for he hath defiled the sanctuary of Jehovah: the water of separation hath not been sprinkled on him: he is unclean.
21  And it shall be an everlasting statute unto them. And he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his garments, and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even.
22  And whatever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.
{20}
1  And the children of Israel, the whole assembly, came into the wilderness of Zin, in the first month; and the people abode at Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.
2  And there was no water for the assembly, and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.
3  And the people contended with Moses, and spoke, saying, Would that we had died when our brethren died before Jehovah!
4  And why have ye brought the congregation of Jehovah into this wilderness, that we should die there, we and our beasts?
5  And why have ye made us to go up out of Egypt, to bring us to this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates, neither is there any water to drink.
6  And Moses and Aaron went from before the congregation to the entrance of the tent of meeting, and fell upon their faces; and the glory of Jehovah appeared to them.
7  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
8  Take the staff, and gather the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes, and it shall give its water; and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock, and shalt give the assembly and their beasts drink.
9  And Moses took the staff from before Jehovah, as he had commanded him.
10  And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said to them, Hear now, ye rebels: shall we bring forth to you water out of this rock?
11  And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his staff smote the rock twice, and much water came out, and the assembly drank, and their beasts.
12  And Jehovah said to Moses and to Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to hallow me before the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land that I have given them.
13  These are the waters of Meribah, where the children of Israel contended with Jehovah, and he hallowed himself in them.
14  And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, Thus says thy brother Israel: Thou knowest all the trouble that hath befallen us,
15  how our fathers went down to Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time, and the Egyptians evil entreated us and our fathers;
16  and when we cried to Jehovah, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and brought us forth out of Egypt; and behold, we are at Kadesh, a city at the extremity of thy border.
17  Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country; we will not pass through fields, or through vineyards, neither will we drink water out of the wells: we will go by the king's road; we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy border.
18  But Edom said to him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword.
19  And the children of Israel said to him, We will go by the high way; and if we drink of thy water, I and my cattle, then I will pay for it: I will only, without anything else, go through on my feet.
20  And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.
21  Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory; and Israel turned away from him.
22  And they removed from Kadesh; and the children of Israel, the whole assembly, came to mount Hor.
23  And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron in mount Hor, on the border of the land of Edom, saying,
24  Aaron shall be gathered unto his peoples; for he shall not enter into the land that I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my commandment at the waters of Meribah.
25  Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor,
26  and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron shall be gathered [to his peoples], and shall die there.
27  And Moses did as Jehovah had commanded, and they went up mount Hor before the eyes of the whole assembly.
28  And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there upon the top of the mountain; and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.
29  And the whole assembly saw that Aaron was dead, and they mourned for Aaron thirty days, [even] the whole house of Israel.
{21}
1  And the Canaanite king of Arad, who dwelt in the south, heard that Israel came by the way of Atharim, and he fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners.
2  Then Israel vowed a vow to Jehovah, and said, If thou give this people wholly into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.
3  And Jehovah listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them, and their cities. And they called the name of the place Hormah.
4  And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to go round the land of Edom; and the soul of the people became impatient on the way;
5  and the people spoke against God, and against Moses, Why have ye brought us up out of Egypt that we should die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, and no water, and our soul loathes this light bread.
6  Then Jehovah sent fiery serpents among the people, which bit the people; and much people of Israel died.
7  And the people came to Moses and said, We have sinned, in that we have spoken against Jehovah, and against thee: pray to Jehovah that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.
8  And Jehovah said to Moses, Make thee a fiery [serpent], and set it upon a pole; and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, and looketh upon it, shall live.
9  And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole; and it came to pass, if a serpent had bitten any man, and he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.
10  And the children of Israel journeyed, and encamped in Oboth.
11  And they removed from Oboth, and encamped at Ijim-Abarim, in the wilderness that is before Moab, toward the sun-rising.
12  From thence they removed, and encamped at the torrent Zered.
13  From thence they removed, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the border of the Amorites. For the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
14  Therefore it is said in the book of the wars of Jehovah, Vaheb in Suphah, and the brooks of Arnon;
15  And the stream of the brooks which turneth to the dwelling of Ar, And inclineth toward the border of Moab.
16  And from thence to Beer: that is the well of which Jehovah spoke to Moses, Assemble the people, and I will give them water.
17  Then Israel sang this song, Rise up, well! sing unto it:
18  Well which princes digged, which the nobles of the people hollowed out at [the word of] the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness [they went] to Mattanah;
19  and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;
20  and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the fields of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks over the surface of the waste.
21  And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
22  Let us pass through thy land; we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink water out of the wells; on the king's road will we go until we have passed thy border.
23  But Sihon would not suffer Israel to go through his border; and Sihon gathered all his people, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
24  And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.
25  And Israel took all these cities, and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, at Heshbon, and in all its dependent villages.
26  For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites; and he had fought against the former king of Moab, and had taken all his land out of his hand, even unto the Arnon.
27  Therefore the poets say, Come to Heshbon; let the city of Sihon be built and established.
28  For there went forth fire from Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon; It consumed Ar of Moab, the lords of the high places of the Arnon.
29  Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, people of Chemosh: He gave his sons that had escaped, and his daughters into captivity to Sihon the king of the Amorites.
30  And we have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon; and we have laid [them] waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba.
31  And Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
32  And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took its dependent villages, and he dispossessed the Amorites that were there.
33  And they turned and went up by the way to Bashan; and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, for battle to Edrei.
34  And Jehovah said to Moses, Fear him not! for into thy hand have I given him, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.
35  And they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, so that they left him none remaining, and took possession of his land.
{22}
1  And the children of Israel journeyed, and encamped in the plains of Moab on the other side of the Jordan from Jericho.
2  And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
3  And Moab was much afraid of the people, because they were many; and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.
4  And Moab said to the elders of Midian, Now will this company lick up all that is round about us, as an ox licks up the green herb of the field. Now Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.
5  And he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is on the river in the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, a people is come out from Egypt; behold, they cover the face of the land, and they abide over against me.
6  And now come, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are mightier than I: perhaps I may be able to smite them, and drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.
7  And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed, having the rewards of divination in their hand. And they came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak.
8  And he said to them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, according as Jehovah shall speak unto me. And the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.
9  And God came to Balaam, and said, Who are these men with thee?
10  And Balaam said to God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me,
11  Behold, a people is come out of Egypt, and it covers the face of the land. Now come, curse me them: perhaps I may be able to fight against them, and drive them out.
12  And God said to Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people; for they are blessed.
13  And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, Go into your land; for Jehovah refuses to give me leave to go with you.
14  And the princes of Moab rose up; and they went to Balak, and said, Balaam has refused to come with us.
15  Then sent Balak yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.
16  And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus says Balak the son of Zippor: Suffer not thyself, I pray thee, to be restrained from coming to me;
17  for very highly will I honour thee, and whatever thou shalt say to me will I do; come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.
18  And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, If Balak give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the commandment of Jehovah my God, to do less or more.
19  And now, I pray you, abide ye also here this night, and I shall know what Jehovah will say to me further.
20  Then God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, If the men have come to call thee, rise up, [and] go with them; but only what I shall say unto thee shalt thou do.
21  And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.
22  And God's anger was kindled because he went; and the Angel of Jehovah set himself in the way to withstand him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two young men were with him.
23  And the ass saw the Angel of Jehovah standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand; and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field, and Balaam smote the ass to turn her into the way.
24  And the Angel of Jehovah stood in a hollow of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.
25  And the ass saw the Angel of Jehovah, and she pressed herself against the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall; and he smote her again.
26  Then the Angel of Jehovah went still further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.
27  And the ass saw the Angel of Jehovah, and lay down under Balaam; and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with his staff.
28  And Jehovah opened the mouth of the ass, and she said to Balaam, What have I done to thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?
29  And Balaam said to the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in my hand, for now would I kill thee!
30  And the ass said to Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine to this day? was I ever wont to do so to thee? And he said, No.
31  Then Jehovah opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the Angel of Jehovah standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed and prostrated himself on his face.
32  And the Angel of Jehovah said to him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, it was I who came forth to withstand thee, for the way [thou walkest in] is for ruin before me.
33  And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times; had she not turned from me, I had now certainly slain thee, and saved her alive.
34  And Balaam said to the Angel of Jehovah, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me; and now, if it be evil in thine eyes, I will get me back again.
35  And the Angel of Jehovah said to Balaam, Go with the men, but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that shalt thou speak. And Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
36  And when Balak heard that Balaam came, he went out to meet him, to the city of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is at the extremity of the border.
37  And Balak said to Balaam, Did I not earnestly send to thee to call thee? why didst thou not come to me? am I not surely able to honour thee?
38  And Balaam said to Balak, Lo, I am come to thee; but shall I now be able at all to say anything? the word that God puts in my mouth, that shall I speak.
39  And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kirjath-huzoth.
40  And Balak offered oxen and small cattle, and sent to Balaam and to the princes that were with him.
41  And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up to the high places of Baal, and he saw from thence the extremity of the people.
{23}
1  And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
2  And Balak did as Balaam had said; and Balak and Balaam offered up a bullock and a ram on [each] altar.
3  And Balaam said to Balak, Stand by thy burnt-offering, and I will go; perhaps Jehovah will come to meet me; and whatever he shews me I will tell thee. And he went to a hill.
4  And God met Balaam; and [Balaam] said to him, I have disposed seven altars, and have offered up a bullock and a ram upon [each] altar.
5  And Jehovah put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and thus shalt thou speak.
6  And he returned to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt-offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.
7  And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, from the mountains of the east: Come, curse me Jacob, and come, denounce Israel!
8  How shall I curse whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I denounce whom Jehovah doth not denounce?
9  For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: Lo, [it is] a people that shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoned among the nations.
10  Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel? Let my soul die the death of the righteous, and let my end be like his!
11  And Balak said to Balaam, What hast thou done to me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.
12  And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which Jehovah puts in my mouth?
13  And Balak said to him, Come, I pray thee, with me to another place, from whence thou wilt see them; thou shalt see only the extremity of them and shalt not see them all, and curse me them from thence.
14  And he took him to the watchmen's field, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bullock and a ram on [each] altar.
15  And [Balaam] said to Balak, Stand here by thy burnt-offering, and I will go to meet yonder.
16  And Jehovah met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and thus shalt thou speak.
17  And he came to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him; and Balak said to him, What has Jehovah spoken?
18  Then he took up his parable and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear! hearken unto me, son of Zippor!
19  God is not a man, that he should lie; neither a son of man, that he should repent. Shall he say and not do? and shall he speak and not make it good?
20  Behold, I have received [mission] to bless; and he hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it.
21  He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen wrong in Israel; Jehovah his God is with him, and the shout of a king is in his midst.
22  God brought him out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of a buffalo.
23  For there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel. At this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!
24  Lo, the people will rise up as a lioness, and lift himself up as a lion. He shall not lie down until he have eaten the prey and drunk the blood of the slain.
25  And Balak said to Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.
26  And Balaam answered and said to Balak, Did I not tell thee, saying, All that Jehovah shall speak, that will I do?
27  And Balak said to Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee to another place; perhaps it will be right in the sight of God that thou curse me them from thence.
28  And Balak brought Balaam to the top of Peor, which looks over the surface of the waste.
29  And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
30  And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bullock and a ram on each altar.
{24}
1  And Balaam saw that it was good in the sight of Jehovah to bless Israel, and he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.
2  And Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel dwelling [in tents] according to his tribes; and the Spirit of God came upon him.
3  And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor saith, and the man of opened eye saith,
4  He saith, who heareth the words of God, who seeth the vision of the Almighty, who falleth down, and who hath his eyes open:
5  How goodly are thy tents, Jacob, and thy tabernacles, Israel!
6  Like valleys are they spread forth, like gardens by the river side, Like aloe-trees which Jehovah hath planted, like cedars beside the waters.
7  Water shall flow out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in great waters, And his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.
8  God brought him out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of a buffalo. He shall consume the nations his enemies, and break their bones, and with his arrows shall smite [them] in pieces.
9  He stooped, he lay down like a lion, and like a lioness: who will stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee.
10  Then Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and behold, thou hast altogether blessed [them] these three times!
11  And now flee thou to thy place; I said I would very highly honour thee, and behold, Jehovah has kept thee back from honour.
12  And Balaam said to Balak, Did I not also speak to thy messengers whom thou sentest to me, saying,
13  If Balak gave me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the commandment of Jehovah to do good or bad out of my heart: what Jehovah shall say, that will I speak?
14  And now behold, I go to my people: come, I will admonish thee what this people will do to thy people at the end of days.
15  And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor saith, and the man of opened eye saith,
16  He saith, who heareth the words of God, who knoweth the knowledge of the Most High, Who seeth the vision of the Almighty, who falleth down, and who hath his eyes open:
17  I shall see him, but not now; I shall behold him, but not nigh: There cometh a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and he shall cut in pieces the corners of Moab, and destroy all the sons of tumult.
18  And Edom shall be a possession, and Seir a possession, -- they, his enemies; but Israel will do valiantly.
19  And one out of Jacob shall have dominion, and will destroy out of the city what remaineth.
20  And he saw Amalek, and took up his parable, and said, Amalek is the first of the nations, but his latter end shall be for destruction.
21  And he saw the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Firm is thy dwelling-place, and thy nest fixed in the rock;
22  But the Kenite shall be consumed, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.
23  And he took up his parable, and said, Alas! Who shall live when God doeth this?
24  And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and afflict Asshur, and afflict Eber, and he also shall be for destruction.
25  And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way.
{25}
1  And Israel abode in Shittim; and the people began to commit fornication with the daughters of Moab.
2  And they invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods; and the people ate, and bowed down to their gods.
3  And Israel joined himself to Baal-Peor; and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel.
4  And Jehovah said to Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up to Jehovah before the sun, that the fierce anger of Jehovah may be turned away from Israel.
5  And Moses said to the judges of Israel, Slay every one his men that have joined themselves to Baal-Peor.
6  And behold, a man of the children of Israel came and brought a Midianitish woman to his brethren, in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of the whole assembly of the children of Israel, who were weeping before the entrance of the tent of meeting.
7  And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, and rose up from among the assembly, and took a javelin in his hand,
8  and he went after the man of Israel into the tent-chamber, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel and the woman through her belly. And the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.
9  And those that died in the plague were twenty-four thousand.
10  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
11  Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.
12  Therefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace!
13  And he shall have it, and his seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was jealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel.
14  And the name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, the prince of a father's house of the Simeonites.
15  And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was tribal head of a father's house in Midian.
16  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
17  Harass the Midianites, and smite them,
18  for they have harassed you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, who was slain on the day of the plague because of the matter of Peor.
{26}
1  And it came to pass after the plague, that Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,
2  Take the sum of the whole assembly of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, according to their fathers' houses, all that go forth to military service in Israel.
3  And Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan of Jericho, saying,
4  From twenty years old and upward...; as Jehovah had commanded Moses and the children of Israel, who went forth out of the land of Egypt.
5  Reuben, the firstborn of Israel: the children of Reuben: [of] Enoch, the family of the Enochites; of Pallu, the family of the Palluites;

9  and the sons of Eliab were Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram. This is that Dathan and Abiram, summoned of the assembly, who contended against Moses and against Aaron in the band of Korah, when they contended against Jehovah.
10  And the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah, when that band died, when the fire devoured the two hundred and fifty men; and they became a sign.

52  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
53  Unto these shall the land be divided for an inheritance according to the number of the names;
54  to the many thou shalt increase their inheritance, and to the few thou shalt diminish their inheritance; to every one shall his inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of him.
55  Notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot; according to the names of the tribes of their fathers shall they inherit;
56  according to lot shall his inheritance be divided to each, be they many or few in number.
57  And these are the numbered of the Levites, after their families: of Gershon, the family of the Gershonites; of Kohath, the family of the Kohathites; of Merari, the family of the Merarites.

60  And to Aaron were born Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
61  And Nadab and Abihu died, when they presented strange fire before Jehovah.
62  And those that were numbered of the [Levites] were twenty-three thousand, all males from a month old and upward; for they were not numbered among the children of Israel, because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel.
63  These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab, by the Jordan of Jericho.
64  But among these there was not a man numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.
65  For Jehovah had said of them, They shall surely die in the wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
{27}
1  Then drew near the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and these were the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.
2  And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and the whole assembly, at the entrance of the tent of meeting, saying,
3  Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the band of them that banded themselves together against Jehovah in the band of Korah; but he died in his own sin, and he had no sons.
4  Why should the name of our father be taken away from his family, because he has no son? Give unto us a possession among the brethren of our father.
5  And Moses brought their cause before Jehovah.
6  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
7  The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.
8  And unto the children of Israel shalt thou speak, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter.
9  And if he have no daughter, ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren.
10  And if he have no brethren, ye shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren.
11  And if his father have no brethren, ye shall give his inheritance to his kinsman that is nearest to him in his family, and he shall possess it; and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of right, as Jehovah commanded Moses.
12  And Jehovah said to Moses, Get thee up into this mount Abarim, and see the land that I have given unto the children of Israel.
13  And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy peoples, as Aaron thy brother was gathered,
14  because ye rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, as to hallowing me in the matter of the water before their eyes. (That is the water of Meribah at Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)
15  And Moses spoke to Jehovah, saying,
16  Let Jehovah, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the assembly,
17  who may go out before them, and who may come in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in, that the assembly of Jehovah be not as sheep that have no shepherd.
18  And Jehovah said to Moses, Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and thou shalt lay thy hand upon him;
19  and thou shalt set him before Eleazar the priest, and before the whole assembly; and give him commandment before their eyes.
20  And thou shalt put of thine honour upon him, that the whole assembly of the children of Israel may obey him.
21  And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him, by the judgment of the Urim before Jehovah: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, he, and all the children of Israel with him, even the whole assembly.
22  And Moses did as Jehovah had commanded him; and he took Joshua and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before the whole assembly.
23  And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him commandment, as Jehovah had said through Moses.
{28}
1  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
2  Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My offering, my bread for my offerings by fire of sweet odour to me, shall ye take heed to present to me at their set time.
3  And say unto them, This is the offering by fire which ye shall present to Jehovah: two yearling lambs without blemish, day by day, as a continual burnt-offering.
4  The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb thou shalt offer between the two evenings;
5  and a tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for an oblation, mingled with beaten oil, a fourth part of a hin:
6  [it is] the continual burnt-offering which was ordained on mount Sinai for a sweet odour, an offering by fire to Jehovah.
7  And the drink-offering thereof shall be a fourth part of a hin for one lamb; in the sanctuary shall the drink-offering of strong drink be poured out to Jehovah.
8  And the second lamb thou shalt offer between the two evenings; [with the] like oblation as that of the morning, and the like drink-offering, shalt thou offer it as an offering by fire of a sweet odour to Jehovah.
9  And on the sabbath day two yearling lambs without blemish, and two tenth parts of fine flour as an oblation, mingled with oil, and the drink-offering thereof:
10  it is the burnt-offering of the sabbath, for each sabbath besides the continual burnt-offering, and its drink-offering.
11  And in the beginnings of your months ye shall present a burnt-offering to Jehovah: two young bullocks, and one ram, seven yearling lambs without blemish.
12  And three tenth parts of fine flour as an oblation, mingled with oil, for one bullock; and two tenth parts of fine flour as an oblation, mingled with oil, for the ram;
13  and a tenth part of fine flour mingled with oil as an oblation for each lamb: [it is] a burnt-offering of a sweet odour, an offering by fire to Jehovah.
14  And their drink-offerings: half a hin of wine for a bullock, and the third part of a hin for the ram, and the fourth part of a hin for a lamb. This is the monthly burnt-offering for each month throughout the months of the year.
15  And a buck of the goats shall be offered, for a sin-offering to Jehovah, besides the continual burnt-offering, and its drink-offering.
16  And in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, is the passover to Jehovah.
17  And on the fifteenth day of this month is the feast; seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.
18  On the first day shall be a holy convocation: no manner of servile work shall ye do;
19  and ye shall present an offering by fire, a burnt-offering to Jehovah: two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven yearling lambs; they shall be unto you without blemish;
20  and their oblation shall be of fine flour mingled with oil: three tenth parts shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth parts for the ram;
21  one tenth part shalt thou offer for each lamb, of the seven lambs;
22  and a he-goat as a sin-offering, to make atonement for you.
23  Besides the burnt-offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt-offering, shall ye offer this.
24  After this manner ye shall offer daily, seven days, the bread of the offering by fire of a sweet odour to Jehovah; it shall be offered besides the continual burnt-offering, and its drink-offering.
25  And on the seventh day ye shall have a holy convocation; no manner of servile work shall ye do.
26  And on the day of the first-fruits, when ye present a new oblation to Jehovah, after your weeks, ye shall have a holy convocation: no manner of servile work shall ye do.
27  And ye shall present a burnt-offering for a sweet odour to Jehovah: two young bullocks, one ram, seven yearling lambs;
28  and their oblation of fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for one bullock, two tenth parts for the ram,
29  one tenth part for each lamb of the seven lambs;
30  [and] one buck of the goats, to make atonement for you.
31  Ye shall offer them besides the continual burnt-offering, and its oblation (without blemish shall they be unto you), and their drink-offerings.
{29}
1  And in the seventh month, on the first of the month, ye shall have a holy convocation: no manner of servile work shall ye do; a day of blowing the trumpets shall it be unto you.
2  And ye shall offer a burnt-offering for a sweet odour to Jehovah: one young bullock, one ram, seven yearling lambs without blemish;
3  and their oblation of fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for the bullock, two tenth parts for the ram,
4  and one tenth part for each lamb of the seven lambs;
5  and one buck of the goats for a sin-offering, to make atonement for you,
6  -- besides the monthly burnt-offering and its oblation, and the continual burnt-offering and its oblation, and their drink-offerings, according to their ordinance, for a sweet odour, an offering by fire to Jehovah.
7  And on the tenth of this seventh month ye shall have a holy convocation; and ye shall afflict your souls; no manner of work shall ye do.
8  And ye shall present a burnt-offering to Jehovah for a sweet odour: one young bullock, one ram, seven yearling lambs (without blemish shall they be unto you);
9  and their oblation of fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for the bullock, two tenth parts for the ram,
10  one tenth part for each lamb, of the seven lambs;
11  [and] one buck of the goats for a sin-offering, -- besides the sin-offering of atonement, and the continual burnt-offering and its oblation, and their drink-offerings.
12  And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month ye shall have a holy convocation: no manner of servile work shall ye do; and ye shall celebrate a feast to Jehovah seven days;
13  and ye shall present a burnt-offering, an offering by fire for a sweet odour to Jehovah: thirteen young bullocks, two rams, fourteen yearling lambs (they shall be without blemish);
14  and their oblation of fine flour mingled with oil: three tenth parts for each bullock of the thirteen bullocks, two tenth parts for each ram of the two rams,
15  and one tenth part for each lamb of the fourteen lambs;
16  and one buck of the goats for a sin-offering, -- besides the continual burnt-offering, its oblation and its drink-offering.
17  And on the second day, [ye shall present] twelve young bullocks, two rams, fourteen yearling lambs without blemish;

39  These shall ye offer to Jehovah in your set feasts, besides your vows, and your voluntary-offerings, for your burnt-offerings, and for your oblations, and for your drink-offerings, and for your peace-offerings.
40  And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses.
{30}
1  And Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying, This is what Jehovah hath commanded.
2  If a man vow a vow to Jehovah, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word; according to all that hath gone out of his mouth shall he do.
3  If a woman also vow a vow to Jehovah, and bind herself by a bond, in her father's house in her youth,
4  and her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall be silent at her, then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.
5  But if her father prohibited her in the day that he heard, none of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand; and Jehovah shall pardon her, because her father prohibited her.
6  And if she have a husband, when she hath her vow upon her or ought that hath passed her lips wherewith she hath bound her soul,
7  and her husband hear it and be silent at her in the day that he heareth it, then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.
8  But if her husband prohibit her on the day that he heareth it, and annul her vow which is upon her, and what hath passed her lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul, then Jehovah shall pardon her.
9  But the vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, -- everything wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand against her.
10  And if she have vowed in her husband's house, or have bound her soul by an oath with a bond,
11  and her husband have heard it, and been silent at her, and hath not prohibited her, then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.
12  But if her husband have expressly annulled them on the day that he heard them, then nothing of that which is gone out of her lips as to her vows or the bond on her soul, shall stand: her husband hath annulled them; and Jehovah will pardon her.
13  Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband can establish it, or her husband can annul it.
14  And if her husband be altogether silent at her from day to day, then he hath established all her vows or all her bonds which are upon her; he hath confirmed them, for he hath been silent at her in the day that he heard them.
15  But if he in any way annul them after he hath heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity.
16  These are the statutes, which Jehovah commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, in her youth in her father's house.
{31}
1  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
2  Avenge the children of Israel upon the Midianites; afterwards shalt thou be gathered unto thy peoples.
3  And Moses spoke to the people, saying, Arm from amongst you men for military service, that they go against Midian to execute Jehovah's vengeance upon Midian.
4  Of every tribe a thousand, of all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war.
5  And there were levied out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand by tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
6  And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand by the tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, and the holy instruments, even the alarm-trumpets in his hand.
7  And they warred against Midian, as Jehovah had commanded Moses, and slew all the males.
8  And they slew the kings of Midian, besides the others slain, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian; and Balaam the son of Beor they slew with the sword.
9  And the children of Israel took the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took for a spoil all their cattle and all their flocks and all their goods;
10  and all their cities in their settlements and all their encampments they burned with fire.
11  And they took all the booty, and all the prey, of man and of cattle;
12  and they brought to Moses and Eleazar the priest, and to the assembly of the children of Israel, the captives and the prey and the booty, to the camp in the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan of Jericho.
13  And Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the princes of the assembly went forth to meet them outside the camp.
14  And Moses was wroth with the officers of the army, with the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war;
15  and Moses said to them, Have ye saved all the women alive?
16  Lo, these, through the counsel of Balaam, caused the children of Israel to commit sin against Jehovah in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague on the assembly of Jehovah.
17  And now slay every male among the little ones, and slay every woman that hath known man by lying with him,
18  but all the children among the women that have not known lying with a man, keep alive for yourselves.
19  And encamp outside the camp seven days; whoever hath killed a person, and whoever hath touched any slain; ye shall purify yourselves on the third day, and on the seventh day, you and your captives.
20  And every garment, and every vessel of skin, and all work of goat's hair, and every utensil of wood shall ye purify.
21  And Eleazar the priest said to the men of war that had gone to the battle, This is the statute of the law which Jehovah hath commanded Moses.
22  Only the gold, and the silver, the copper, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
23  everything that passeth through the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean; only it shall be purified with the water of separation; and everything that cannot pass through the fire ye shall make go through the water.
24  And ye shall wash your garments on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean; and afterwards ye may come into the camp.
25  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
26  Take the sum of the prey that was taken, of man and of cattle, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the assembly;
27  and divide the prey into halves, between them that conducted the war, who went out to the battle, and the whole assembly.
28  And thou shalt levy a tribute for Jehovah of the men of war who went out to the army, one soul of five hundred of the persons, and of the oxen, and of the asses, and of the small cattle.
29  Of their half shall ye take it, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for a heave-offering of Jehovah.
30  And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the oxen, of the asses, and of the small cattle, of every [kind of] beasts, and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, who keep the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah.
31  And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
32  And the prey, the rest of the spoil, which the men of war had taken, was six hundred and seventy-five thousand sheep,
33  and seventy-two thousand oxen,
34  and sixty-one thousand asses,
35  and of human persons, of the women that had not known lying with a man, all the persons were thirty-two thousand.
36  And the half, the portion of them that had gone out to the war, was in number three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep,
37  and the tribute for Jehovah of the sheep was six hundred and seventy-five;
38  and the oxen were thirty-six thousand, and the tribute thereof for Jehovah, seventy-two;
39  and the asses were thirty thousand five hundred, and the tribute thereof for Jehovah, sixty-one;
40  and the human persons were sixteen thousand, of whom the tribute for Jehovah was thirty-two persons.
41  And Moses gave the tribute of Jehovah's heave-offering to Eleazar the priest, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
42  And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses had divided, [taking it] from the men that served in the war,
43  (now the half belonging to the assembly was of the sheep, three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred,
44  and thirty-six thousand oxen,
45  and thirty thousand five hundred asses,
46  and sixteen thousand human persons,)
47  ...of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of fifty, of man and of cattle, and gave them to the Levites who kept the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah; as Jehovah had commanded Moses.
48  And the officers who were over the thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near to Moses,
49  and they said to Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war who were under our hand, and there is not one man of us lacking.
50  So we present the offering of Jehovah, that which each one hath found, jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and necklaces, to make atonement for our souls before Jehovah.
51  And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, all manner of wrought jewels.
52  And all the gold of the heave-offering that they offered to Jehovah was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels, from the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds.
53  (The men of war had taken spoil each one for himself.)
54  And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting, as a memorial for the children of Israel before Jehovah.
{32}
1  And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had much cattle, a very great multitude; and they saw the land of Jaazer, and the land of Gilead, and behold, the place was a place for cattle.
2  And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes of the assembly, saying,
3  Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jaazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elaleh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon,
4  the country that Jehovah smote before the assembly of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle;
5  and they said, If we have found favour in thine eyes, let this land be given to thy servants for a possession: bring us not over the Jordan.
6  And Moses said to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall *ye* abide here?
7  And why do ye discourage the children of Israel from going over into the land that Jehovah has given them?
8  Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land:
9  they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, and discouraged the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land that Jehovah had given them.
10  And Jehovah's anger was kindled the same time, and he swore, saying,
11  If the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land that I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob! for they have not wholly followed me;
12  save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun; for they have wholly followed Jehovah.
13  And Jehovah's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until the whole generation was consumed that had done evil in the eyes of Jehovah.
14  And behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, a progeny of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of Jehovah toward Israel.
15  If ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.
16  And they drew near to him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones;
17  but we ourselves will go with diligence armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them to their place; and our little ones shall dwell in the strong cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
18  We will not return to our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited each one his inheritance.
19  For we will not inherit with them on yonder side the Jordan, and further, because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side the Jordan eastward.
20  And Moses said to them, If ye do this thing, if ye arm yourselves before Jehovah for war,
21  and all of you that are armed go over the Jordan before Jehovah, until he have dispossessed his enemies from before him,
22  and the land is subdued before Jehovah, and afterwards ye return, ye shall be guiltless toward Jehovah and toward Israel, and this land shall be your possession before Jehovah.
23  But if ye do not do so, behold, ye have sinned against Jehovah, and be sure your sin will find you out.
24  Build yourselves cities for your little ones, and folds for your flocks, and do that which has gone out of your mouth.
25  And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commands.
26  Our little ones, our wives, our cattle, and all our beasts shall be there in the cities of Gilead;
27  but thy servants will pass over, every one armed for war, before Jehovah to battle, as my lord says.
28  So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel.
29  And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben pass with you over the Jordan, every one armed for battle, before Jehovah, and the land be subdued before you, then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession;
30  but if they do not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.
31  And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As Jehovah has said to thy servants, so will we do.
32  We will pass over armed before Jehovah into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance on this side the Jordan shall be ours.
33  And Moses gave to them, to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og the king of Bashan, the land, according to its cities and territories, the cities of the land round about.
34  And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,
35  and Atroth-Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbebah,
36  and Beth-Nimrah, and Beth-haran, strong cities, and sheepfolds.
37  -- And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elaleh, and Kirjathaim,
38  and Nebo, and Baal-meon (of which the names were changed), and Sibmah; and they gave other names to the cities that they built.
39  -- And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and they dispossessed the Amorites that were therein.
40  And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein.
41  And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took their hamlets, and called them Havoth-Jair.
42  And Nobah went and took Kenath, and its dependent villages, and called it Nobah, after his name.
{33}
1  These are the journeys of the children of Israel, who went forth out of the land of Egypt according to their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron.
2  And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of Jehovah; and these are their journeys according to their goings out.
3  They journeyed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month. On the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians.
4  And the Egyptians buried those whom Jehovah had smitten among them, all the firstborn; and upon their gods Jehovah executed judgments.
5  And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and encamped in Succoth.
6  And they removed from Succoth and encamped in Etham, which is at the end of the wilderness.
7  And they removed from Etham, and turned back to Pi-hahiroth, which is opposite Baal-Zephon, and encamped before Migdol.
8  And they removed from before Hahiroth, and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days' journey in the wilderness of Etham, and encamped in Marah.
9  And they removed from Marah, and came to Elim; and in Elim were twelve springs of water, and seventy palm-trees, and they encamped there.
10  And they removed from Elim, and encamped by the Red sea.
11  And they removed from the Red sea, and encamped in the wilderness of Sin.
12  And they removed from the wilderness of Sin, and encamped in Dophkah.
13  And they removed from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush.
14  And they removed from Alush, and encamped at Rephidim, where there was no water for the people to drink.
15  And they removed from Rephidim, and encamped in the wilderness of Sinai.
16  And they removed from the wilderness of Sinai, and encamped at Kibroth-hattaavah.
17  And they removed from Kibroth-hattaavah, and encamped at Hazeroth.
18  And they removed from Hazeroth, and encamped in Rithmah.
19  And they removed from Rithmah, and encamped at Rimmon-perez.
20  And they removed from Rimmon-perez, and encamped in Libnah.
21  And they removed from Libnah, and encamped at Rissah.
22  And they removed from Rissah, and encamped in Kehelathah.
23  And they removed from Kehelathah, and encamped in mount Shapher.
24  And they removed from mount Shapher, and encamped in Haradah.
25  And they removed from Haradah, and encamped in Makheloth.
26  And they removed from Makheloth, and encamped at Tahath.
27  And they removed from Tahath, and encamped at Terah.
28  And they removed from Terah, and encamped in Mithcah.
29  And they removed from Mithcah, and encamped in Hashmonah.
30  And they removed from Hashmonah, and encamped in Moseroth.
31  And they removed from Moseroth, and encamped in Bene-Jaakan.
32  And they removed from Bene-Jaakan, and encamped at Hor-hagidgad.
33  And they removed from Hor-hagidgad, and encamped in Jotbathah.
34  And they removed from Jotbathah, and encamped at Abronah.
35  And they removed from Abronah, and encamped at Ezion-geber.
36  And they removed from Ezion-geber, and encamped in the wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh.
37  And they removed from Kadesh, and encamped in mount Hor, in the border of the land of Edom.
38  And Aaron the priest went up mount Hor by the commandment of Jehovah, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel came out of the land of Egypt, in the fifth month, on the first of the month.
39  And Aaron was a hundred and twenty-three years old when he died on mount Hor.
40  And the Canaanite, the king of Arad who dwelt in the south in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.
41  And they removed from mount Hor, and encamped in Zalmonah.
42  And they removed from Zalmonah, and encamped in Punon.
43  And they removed from Punon, and encamped in Oboth.
44  And they removed from Oboth, and encamped in Ijim-Abarim, in the border of Moab.
45  And they removed from Ijim, and encamped in Dibon-Gad.
46  And they removed from Dibon-Gad, and encamped in Almon-Diblathaim.
47  And they removed from Almon-Diblathaim, and encamped in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo.
48  And they removed from the mountains of Abarim, and encamped in the plains of Moab by the Jordan of Jericho.
49  And they encamped by the Jordan, from Beth-jeshimoth unto Abel-Shittim, in the plains of Moab.
50  And Jehovah spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan of Jericho, saying,
51  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye pass over Jordan into the land of Canaan,
52  then ye shall dispossess all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and ye shall destroy all their figured images, and all their molten images shall ye destroy, and all their high places shall ye lay waste;
53  and ye shall take possession of the land, and dwell therein, for to you have I given the land to possess it.
54  And ye shall take for yourselves the land as an inheritance by lot according to your families: to the many ye shall increase their inheritance, and to the few thou shalt diminish their inheritance: where the lot falleth to him, there shall be each man's [inheritance]; according to the tribes of your fathers shall ye take for yourselves the inheritance.
55  But if ye will not dispossess the inhabitants of the land from before you, those that ye let remain of them shall be thorns in your eyes, and pricks in your sides, and they shall harass you in the land wherein ye dwell.
56  And it shall come to pass that I will do unto you as I thought to do unto them.
{34}
1  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
2  Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land of Canaan, this shall be the land that shall fall to you for an inheritance, the land of Canaan according to the borders thereof.
3  Then your south side shall be from the wilderness of Zin alongside of Edom, and your southern border shall be from the end of the salt sea eastward;
4  and your border shall turn from the south of the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin, and shall end southward at Kadesh-barnea, and shall go on to Hazar-Addar, and pass on to Azmon.
5  And the border shall turn from Azmon unto the torrent of Egypt, and shall end at the sea.
6  And as west border ye shall have the great sea, and [its] coast. This shall be your west border.
7  And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall mark out for you mount Hor;
8  from mount Hor ye shall mark out the entrance to Hamath, and the end of the border shall be toward Zedad;
9  and the border shall go to Ziphron, and shall end at Hazar-enan. This shall be your north border.
10  And ye shall mark out for you as eastern border from Hazar-enan to Shepham:
11  and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall strike upon the extremity of the sea of Chinnereth eastward;
12  and the border shall go down to the Jordan, and shall end at the salt sea. This shall be your land according to the borders thereof round about.
13  And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land which ye shall take for yourselves as inheritance by lot, which Jehovah commanded to give to the nine tribes, and to the half tribe.
14  For the tribe of the children of the Reubenites according to their fathers' houses, and the tribe of the children of the Gadites according to their fathers' houses, have received, and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance;
15  the two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side the Jordan of Jericho eastward, toward the sun-rising.
16  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
17  These are the names of the men who shall divide the land unto you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.
18  And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land.
19  And these are the names of the men: for the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;
20  and for the tribe of the children of Simeon, Samuel the son of Ammihud;
21  for the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon;
22  and for the tribe of the children of Dan, a prince, Bukki the son of Jogli;
23  for the children of Joseph: for the tribe of the children of Manasseh, a prince, Hanniel the son of Ephod,
24  and for the tribe of the children of Ephraim, a prince, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan;
25  and for the tribe of the children of Zebulun, a prince, Elizaphan the son of Pharnach;
26  and for the tribe of the children of Issachar, a prince, Phaltiel the son of Azzan;
27  and for the tribe of the children of Asher, a prince, Ahihud the son of Shelomi;
28  and for the tribe of the children of Naphtali, a prince, Phedahel the son of Ammihud.
29  These are they whom Jehovah commanded to distribute to the children of Israel their inheritance in the land of Canaan.
{35}
1  And Jehovah spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan of Jericho, saying,
2  Command the children of Israel, that of the inheritance of their possession they give unto the Levites cities to dwell in; and a suburb for the cities round about them shall ye give unto the Levites.
3  And the cities shall they have to dwell in, and their suburbs shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts.
4  And the suburbs of the cities that ye shall give unto the Levites shall be from the walls of the city outward, a thousand cubits round about.
5  And ye shall measure, without the city, the east side two thousand cubits, and the south side two thousand cubits, and the west side two thousand cubits, and the north side two thousand cubits, and the city shall be in the midst: they shall have this as suburbs of the cities.
6  And [among] the cities that ye shall give unto the Levites [shall be] the six cities of refuge, which ye shall appoint for the manslayer, that he may flee thither, -- and besides them ye shall give forty-two cities:
7  all the cities that ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty-eight cities, they and their suburbs.
8  And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the children of Israel: from them that have much ye shall take much, and from them that have little ye shall take little; each one according to his inheritance which he will inherit shall give of his cities to the Levites.
9  And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,
10  Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
11  then ye shall appoint for yourselves cities: cities of refuge shall they be for you; that a manslayer may flee thither, who without intent smiteth a person mortally.
12  And ye shall have these cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he have stood before the assembly in judgment.
13  And the cities that ye shall give shall be six cities of refuge for you.
14  Three cities shall ye give on this side of the Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan; they shall be cities of refuge.
15  For the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them shall these six cities be a refuge, that one who smiteth a person mortally without intent may flee thither.
16  And if he have smitten him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall certainly be put to death.
17  And if he have smitten him with a stone from the hand, wherewith one may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall certainly be put to death.
18  Or if he have smitten him with an instrument of wood, in the hand, wherewith one may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall certainly be put to death;
19  the avenger of blood, he shall put the murderer to death; when he meeteth him, he shall put him to death.
20  And if he thrust at him out of hatred, or hurl at him intentionally, so that he die,
21  or from enmity smite him with his hand, so that he die, he that smote him shall certainly be put to death; he is a murderer: the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death, when he meeteth him. -- 
22  But if he have thrust at him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon him anything unintentionally,
23  or [have smitten him] with any stone wherewith one may die, without seeing him, and have cast it upon him so that he die, and he was not his enemy, neither sought his harm:
24  then the assembly shall judge between the smiter and the avenger of blood according to these judgments;
25  and the assembly shall rescue the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the assembly shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he had fled; and he shall abide in it until the death of the high-priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.
26  But if the manslayer shall in any way come outside the limits of the city of his refuge whither he hath fled,
27  and the avenger of blood find him outside the limits of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood kill the manslayer, there shall be no blood-guiltiness upon him;
28  for the manslayer should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high-priest; but after the death of the high-priest he may return into the land of his possession.
29  And this shall be unto you a statute of right throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
30  Whoever shall smite a person mortally, at the mouth of witnesses shall the murderer be put to death; but one witness shall not testify against a person to cause him to die.
31  And ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, who is guilty of death, but he shall certainly be put to death.
32  And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that hath fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.
33  And ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are; for blood, it polluteth the land; and there can be no atonement made for the land, for the blood that hath been shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.
34  And ye shall not defile the land that ye inhabit, in the midst whereof I dwell; for I am Jehovah who dwell in the midst of the children of Israel.
{36}
1  And the chief fathers of families of the sons of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel:
2  and they said, Jehovah commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel; and my lord was commanded by Jehovah to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.
3  Now if they be married to any of the sons of the [other] tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they shall belong; and it shall be taken from the lot of our inheritance.
4  And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall come, then shall their inheritance be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they shall belong; and their inheritance shall be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.
5  And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of Jehovah, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well.
6  This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry whom they please; only they shall marry one of the tribe of their father,
7  that no inheritance of the children of Israel pass from tribe to tribe; for every one of the children of Israel shall keep to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
8  And every daughter that possesseth an inheritance among the tribes of the children of Israel, shall be married to one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may possess every one the inheritance of his fathers,
9  and the inheritance shall not pass from one tribe to another tribe; for each of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep to his inheritance.
10  Even as Jehovah had commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad;
11  and Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their uncles' sons.
12  To those that were of the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph were they married; and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.
13  These are the commandments and the ordinances which Jehovah commanded through Moses to the children of Israel, in the plains of Moab, by the Jordan of Jericho.
